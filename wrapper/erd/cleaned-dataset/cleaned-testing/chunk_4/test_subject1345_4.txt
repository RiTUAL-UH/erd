 If you don't mind me asking 




 How much were they though? 




 I did that for my dc's and it's amazing. Good call. Thank you. It doesn't hurt that they are gorgeous boots 




 Definitely about to pick those up. Thank you 




 And they're quality? I've never bought vans snowboard apparel. Can I trust em? 




 Yeah my local shop seeks last year's model for cheap so I might get em! Thanks 




 How much did you get them for? 




 How many seasons have you gotten out of them? 




 Yeah my local shop does a huge last season's model sale so I'm gonna head down in these next few days. I ride dc's now. I got a good 3 seasons out of em but they're shot. Thanks for the advice 




 I am beyond jealous
