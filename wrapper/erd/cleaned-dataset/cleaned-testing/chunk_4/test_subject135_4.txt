 Okay, direct me to some. 




 This is funny, but I don't think it takes into account the fact that the book was published in 1947.

 Because the word "like" means "similar to

That's exactly the meaning, as I said already -- they're conveying the tone and meaning that's *similar* to what the person said, but not their precise words. 




 I can see two possibilities for why she might be doing this: Either she's not hungry or she's playing a game that she thinks is funny. 

If it's possible that she's not hungry, you might try delaying her feeding time by half an hour or so and see if that makes a difference. 

If she's playing a game, you have to put your foot down and tell her that if she spits out a bite, you can't give her another one. And if she spits it out again, you take her out of her chair, tell her that dinner is over, and you walk away. This should get the message across more than just telling her over and over again that spitting out your food isn't a good game. 




 How so? 




 I, like, don't understand

This way of using "like" has been around for at least 20 years. 

I was like

In this case, "like" conveys the tone and meaning of what the person said but not their exact words. 

 




 I haven't personally experienced it, I read it in one of these guides that tell you about gestures that mean one thing in one place may mean the opposite or even be offensive somewhere else.

 I think you misunderstood what I was saying. My point was that OP was misunderstanding the nature of small businesses -- they're not all McDonald's franchises with 30 workers that you can take advantage of by paying them low wages. Many of them employ only the owner or the owner and his family -- and those aren't people whose wages you're going to want to skimp on. 




 New Yorker here. Best water of any big city in the country. I drink less than a cup a day.  




 They're small, largely homogeneous countries with very strong Protestant ethics.  




 Unless the murderer was a contract killer for hire, they killed someone for their own personal reasons and don't have any interest in killing people as a day job. If they were a serial killer psychopath, doing executions just isn't going to be satisfying in any way.

And if the person was a contract killer for hire, he wants to be paid an awful lot of money for his services. A lot more than the state would be willing to pay. 




 Like you said, tradition. The languages and instruments available way back  when set constraints on what their music was going to sound like, so that became the traditional music of that culture. In today's day and age, everybody makes the same bland pop music and traditional music is considered quaint or boring or folky. 




 I think it's just you. Whenever there's a two-second gap between one song and the next I immediately start worrying that the site froze.

But like you said, it's probably that you're not really listening to it in the first place. 




 And if you do start your own hot dog stand, the only worker you're probably going to employ is yourself. Not too helpful to pay yourself less than you deserve. 




 It's absolutely not consistent, so be careful when you travel. 




 "Guerrilla marketing" no doubt. I'd report it to the manager.

 Most of the parts of Queens and Brooklyn that don't have subway service prefer it that way. It's not a bug, it's a feature. Literally. 




 Not usually. I live in the New York and the rats I see on the subway or occasionally on the street are typical rat size. That is to say, fairly small. 

A few years ago there was a giant rat killed and it was a different type of rat than most are.

 They're going to find a bunch of idiots who say they never follow the news so even if they know  a terrorist blew up some people at the Boston Marathon, they don't really have any opinion on this Jafar* guy.

And believe me, people like this exist. I was recently on jury duty and in voir dire I was shocked at what some clearly intelligent and educated people had not heard of and had no opinions on.

 You're talking about a person who is currently gaining weight. I'm talking about a person who is maintaining their weight. When you maintain your weight, whether you're eating 1,000 or 4,000 calories, it's 4,000 calories in, 4,000 calories out. If you start walking and have 4,000 calories in and 4,100 calories out, you will lose weight. 




 Trying to explain that weight loss is really nothing more than calories in vs out to some people is like talking to a brick wall. My mother seems to think she needs to start doing crunches. No. You need to eat differently and exercise.

Well, not necessarily. It is calories in, calories out, but if you can effectively change the calories out, you don't necessarily have to change the calories in. So while crunches certainly aren't going to do anything, but if a sedentary person starts walking half an hour a day without altering how much they eat, they will lose weight. 




 Um, what? You don't need proper nutrition to maintain your weight, you only need calories.  




 I disagree. LOTR is tough reading; ASOIF is easy reading. LOTR is high fantasy, ASOIF is low fantasy as it de-emphasizes the traditional fantasy aspects.

OP: If you don't like LOTR, you probably won't like any other high fantasy books.

 Not that I doubt that this is true, but how do they compare with religious people of similar ethnic, economic, and regional backgrounds? Not to mention the fact that in some parts of America, it takes a bit of guts to be secular, so it wouldn't at all be surprising that people who don't care about following the crowd aren't sheeple and don't just fall in line with what other people are thinking and doing. That's not about religiousness or secular-ness, but personality.

TLDR: Did they take into account confounding factors? 




 If you're not allowed to put up curtains, how about frosted window film? 




 My 2015 has started off crappy all around. I've only seen one movie so far: Theodora Goes Wild (1936). 3.5/5 stars.

 Sometimes knowing what you want to do is instinctive, but sometimes it's about sitting down and asking yourself what your interests are, how you envision your future life, and what you're willing to do to make that happen.

A lot of people don't really know themselves, didn't pay that much attention in school, haven't gotten much guidance from counselors or teachers or parents, and are frankly unable to imagine that someday they're going to have to pay for their own Internet connection. So when you feel like a perpetual adolescent, there's no real pressure to figure out what you're going to do, especially since sometimes what you're *going* to do isn't necessarily what you *want* to do, but it'll pay the bills better than what you *want* to do.

 There are no differences, in a general sense. In a literature class a teacher may choose books that he thinks will appeal to girls, but history is history. Science is science. It all comes out of the same textbooks. No additional training is needed.

Men teach at all-girls schools all the time.

 Sounds like your relationship lacks passion. You have a good, stable, happy relationship, but there's no oomph. It's basically being in a rut. 

You're young. Might be worth it to dump him and find someone that you have more of a spark with, someone who inspires you and you inspire him. Maybe someone who's more outgoing or outdoorsy.  




 The article is about a woman who lost a baby and six months later she was still grieving and depressed and she thought there was something wrong with her because she hadn't gotten over it yet.

I'm stunned that anybody would think this. From the article:

[Kubler-Ross's] model is still deeply and rigidly embedded in our cultural consciousness and psychological language. It inspires much self-diagnosis and self-criticism among the aggrieved. This is compounded by the often subtle and well-meaning judgment of the surrounding community. A person is to grieve for only so long and with so much intensity.

Really? Do you think this is broadly true? I think that most people know that losing a baby is about one of the most traumatic things a person can experience.  









 I have 300 books on my to-read list and I always have twice as many books at home as I could possibly read in a week so this pretty much cannot happen to me. 

One thing you can do is make a list of authors that you like and read their entire back catalogue.  




 Hopefully you're getting help for that.

But even if you can't choose (or change) how you feel, you can choose what you say. So if next time you want to turn down a piece of chocolate cake, you can say, I'm trying to eat healthier, instead of saying, I'm on a diet because I'm so fat. 




 I find it rude when somebody skinnier than me says, "Oh, I'm so fat!"

Pretty sure everyone thinks that's obnoxious except the people saying it.

 Twilight and Dragon Tattoo were both supposed to be examples of popular bestsellers, and if you think that about Dragon Tattoo, I imagine you don't tend to like any popular bestsellers. If that's not the case, what would you name as a good popular bestseller?

I think either is a good example of a typical bestseller. Twilight is YA and Dragon Tattoo is a translation and honestly, I question whether it would have been published or at least have been as big a seller if the author hadn't died. Good examples? John Sandford, John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark, Maeve Binchy.

I thought Lisbeth was a believable character, and of a kind that we don't get to see very often: a woman who is ferocious, who fights back for herself even though she has been shat on basically her whole life, who is probably on the autistic spectrum.

I didn't find her believable at all. To me she came across as roboticly strong except when the author needed her to be pathetically weak. And she could not have been on the autism spectrum or she could never have done that undercover thing.

It was wish fulfillment in the sense that Larsson did wish his magazine would get as big as Millenium, but that's a much more interesting wish than "oh I want this 'perfect' creepy stalker vampire boy to like me".

Not that bit, the bit where pretty much every woman finds Blomkvist so completely irresistible.  




 Had to read it for 9th grade reading assignment. Was the only book I was ever assigned that I really liked. 




 I don't like the high/middle/lowbrow framing because it implies that there is some objective scale of taste determined by how smart a book is.

I'm not sure what you mean by smart. The "brows" are pretty well-defined. Low-brow is romance and James Patterson, middle-brow is your typical bestseller, and high-brow is literary. It has little to do with quality or goodness, though 99% of low-brow books are pretty bad, but probably an equal number of middle- and high-brow books are also bad. Just because something is literary, doesn't mean it's any good.

 To me, good taste is more like being able to identify the best in a given genre in as many genres as possible.

That's even more subjective.

good taste is knowing the difference between The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Twilight

While obviously Dragon Tattoo is better than Twilight, pretty much everything that's ever been published is better than Twilight, so that's not saying much. Good taste is knowing that Dragon Tattoo is overhyped, overlong, sexist, and a Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasy just as much as Twilight is a wish fulfillment fantasy.  




 At least we're talking about the same thing. I'm going to have to say the opposite as you -- since you're not used to hearing it, you don't hear the fine distinction.  




 Read half of them. Dragon Tattoo and WWZ are wordy trash. Mr. Penumbra is like a children's book. 

Murakami's Norwegian Wood is literary but still easy reading and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake is literary and SF to draw in people who generally prefer genre writing. Though maybe Children of Men by P. D. James might be a better suggestion along the same lines. 




 Oh, I hear it. NY/Jewish pronunciation drives me insane.

Tawk.  




 Good point, not such good suggestions. Most of these are on par with Cook and Crichton. Instead, I would suggest literary authors who aren't nearly as heavy as Garcia Marquez and McCarthy, say Margaret Atwood or Haruki Murakami, or light classic authors like Alexandre Dumas.  




 Depending on what you do and whether it's realistic to expect that you will ever make $250K, you are probably overreacting. 




 Yeah, if she's like this with everyone, then she needs therapy and OP needs to consider whether it's something he can live with forever if she doesn't go. But if she's only like this with OP, then he's probably being a passive-aggressive asshole and she's sick of it and either they need couples therapy or to break up because it's only going to get worse. 




 Someone you confide in and who confides in you is your friend, so you have friends. You just aren't a social butterfly. Nothing wrong with that. You might feel more normal if you developed friendships with other introverts, though. Are you in school? Then pick the person in your class who seems the least interested in talking to anybody -- they're probably a fellow introvert.  




 Two books that I can remember not finishing (off the top of my head):

- The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino. It started out clever but then it kind of got repetitive and annoying. 

- The Long War by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. Just plain boring. I blame Baxter. 

As for books I did finish, the worst book I read was The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger. Thanks for nothing, Redditors who recommended it. Even though it was a short book (like 200 pages), it was still 180 pages too long. It would have been a good short story. 




 I don't like the word "good" in this context. I prefer highbrow, lowbrow and middlebrow because I know people who who likes classics and that's considered good taste, but I don't think they have good taste in books at all -- they just happen to like overly wordy and descriptive writing. In other words, it's just a personal preference, not a recognition of the value of classic literature.

I think I have critical middlebrow taste. I read a lot of popular bestsellers and the like, but I rate most of them as being average and not particularly good either because the story is bland or hackneyed or otherwise uninspired and/or the writing is.  




 It's not about fiction versus non-fiction, it's about books that have meat to them versus books that are just fluffy entertainment. If you're reading books that you felt were a "great time," then of course you won't feel the same way the second time around. Books that stand up to re-reading are ones that you felt had deep personal meaning or significance. 




 I don't think anybody's hating on him, I think it's just surprising because it's so random.  




 I don't really think this is an appropriate question. You might try to encourage him to be more complimentary when you look especially nice or when you've done a particularly good job of something, or to be more thankful when you do things for him, or just to say "I love you" more, but for him to enumerate precisely what he likes about you... that smacks of "does this dress make me look fat." 




 You might want to check out this similar thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rt1ha/me_27f_with_my_husband30m_of_3_years_ive_married/

In your husband's case, he may have trouble with motivation because he's been institutionalized by being in the military. They tell you when to go to bed and when to get up and when to eat and when to work and it's hard to have to do these things on your own. But he's had two years now, it's time to have a serious talk about his life and your relationship.

 Where I live there are a couple of all-news radio stations. I listen for about 15 minutes every morning and get the highlights. You could try that? 




 far less American women find Asian men attractive? 

It's not that American women don't find Asian men attractive, they just don't fetishize them the way American men fetishize Asian women, so it doesn't stand out as much. American women definitely find Asian men attractive.  




 Huh? On BBC Sherlock, Mycroft is played by Mark Gatiss, who is gay. Not nude that I've seen.  




 Never thought those names would ever be in a sentence together. 









 And I've been working for 15 years and have known people who've lied on their resume and have not only gotten the job, but advanced further than I have in the same amount of time and nobody ever found them out.

It's not that I really think people should do this, I'm just angry and bitter over what I see as a completely unfair hiring process, and HR professionals even admit that it's absolutely useless for finding the "best person" for the job, but nobody's willing to replace it with something better. 




 All of these comments from HR people about not lying on resumes is the biggest bunch of crap ever. Lie your head off. Nobody checks. As long as you can successfully BS the interview, you're golden. Until you wind up as CEO and then they look into your resume and find out you didn't graduate from college the way you claimed to. Then you'll be fired. But otherwise, a good BS resume will get you a lot further than an honest resume unless you're amazing. And if you're amazing, you're not reading this thread for resume tips anyway. 









 There is. Just Google Rod Ferrell book. 









 I'm surprised Gravesend is the most expensive of the southern Brooklyn neighborhoods.

One of the most surprising bits of data was the Syrian orthodox enclave within Gravesend. While Gravesend averages $470/sq.ft., the section between Avenues S and U, averages $2,000 per square foot. Houses sell for $1012M, putting it among the most expensive neighborhoods of the city by median price. (And if one simply averaged the entire neighborhood, this interesting enclave wouldnt be visible. At a time when developers and brokers are creating unnecessary new neighborhood names to promote emerging areas (the cringeworthy ProCro and Bedwick come to mind), this area constitutes such a different market that it actually merits a different name.

Oh. So they cheated, in other words.

I'd like to see all the neighborhoods in a chart. The maps aren't really that helpful. 




 I don't really subscribe to "fit at any weight" because I think too many people use it as an excuse not to lose weight, but I don't think it's impossible to be true, either. Just like there are people who smoke all their lives and live to be 100.

In other words, not all healthy people are thin. Healthy people come in all shapes and sizes. 




 You actually have to work very hard to be famous. It's not just something that happens by accident. There's a difference between being successful and being famous.

For example, when Benedict Cumberbatch was just doing Sherlock, he was successful and had a certain amount of fame on the Internet, but the general public had not idea who he was. Then he went and got a part in half the movies that came out this year and his face is everywhere. Now he's famous. 




 Sure I have. In fact, in one of them I couldn't see a thing. And the reason why it didn't matter was because it was free. If I'd've had to pay, I would have been pissed. 




 It's certainly part of it.  




 If you just wanted to hear her voice, you could just listen to her songs -- why bother going to a concert? 




 For example, Sia performed with a bag over her head. She says she's about the music and doesn't want to be famous. But she is world-famous and a huge seller. So when people go to a concert of hers, they want to see her performing. Not the back of her head or a paper bag.

So, while I can understand her desire to be authentic and not a sell-out, is it really "fair" to keep acting like she's still a small indie musician once she's attained this level of success? 




 Good point. We shouldn't be testing young models, we should be testing those 40 and up.  




 Yeah, waist size is not the gold standard for deciding whether someone is healthy or not. Let's see some blood tests, blood pressure, cholesterol, that sort of thing. But even if those come back normal, that's not saying much. Models are mostly young and young people can abuse their bodies and not have the effects show for years before it catches up to them. 




 It's by Ian Fleming, in case people don't know. And, the script of the movie was by Roald Dahl (and Ken Hughes). 




 I don't know, maybe I misunderstood what you were asking since I've never heard anybody do this.  




 That's correct usage.

You just have to take out the other person's name to see if the sentence still works. "I went to the whorehouse for a good time" versus "Me went to the whorehouse for a good time." 

So take "The restaurant gave John and I a discount" -- "The restaurant gave I a discount." Clearly doesn't work, so it's "The restaurant gave John and me a discount." 




 Because there's not much I can do to stop smelling disgusting cigarette smoke if someone is smoking in my vicinity. It's very easy not to look at a disgusting fat person.

 I've never encountered this. Sounds like a variation of uptalk. Where you end every sentence with a question mark? Even if it's a statement? Basically a kind of insecurity? But at this point a linguistic (?) lexical (?) trend? 




 When someone says "x and I" even when it's supposed to be "x and me." They're applying a rule they think they know in order to sound smart/correct, but it just makes them sound like an idiot. 




 I agree with this, but my concern with a close relationship is: What happens if OP and mom break up? Will OP still take the time to be a "Big Brother" to her? 




 I don't understand the double standard.

One possibility: Because nobody's going to ask you for tzedaka to support the guy who works but doesn't learn and his 12 children.

 I think you're mistaking Reddit for real life. In real life most people of any age are not libertarians. 




 It's because the taxes are different on wholesalers than on retailers. So it's not that they're banning resale of their goods, they're saying: If people are buying our stuff in bulk and reselling it, the taxes are their problem, not ours. 




 What retailers ban resale of their goods? In the US there is only the right of first sale. Once it's sold, it's not theirs anymore and they have no right to dictate what you do with it.
