 So... what's the minimum quantity? 




 Do you have a minimum quantity? 




 This would be an extremely handy feature. In a subreddit where flair is not mandatory, it could be a savior.

On /r/vine, there's a flair for unusually loud vines. But if the poster refuses to flair it properly, and a moderator never checks it, users could keep falling victim to a loud vine raping their ears.

So what if a comment that said

 \#tooloud

could get automoderator to automatically flair the post or tell the moderators that the post needs flair? 




 Could you elaborate on sales collateral? I'm interested, but I'm not sure if that's a term I just haven't heard or something I actually wouldn't be able to do.

 Because with cable, you're paying for a services that presses a switch and let's you access their channels. The money you pay doesn't go to the companies who host their channels. The companies need money to maintain those channels and to maintain their slot on the sevice of the providers. The only way they can do this is for advertisers to give them money to also be on that channel.

Netflix: you pay for Internet, and you pay for content to keep Netflix funded.

Cable: you pay for cable, and advertisers pay to keep content funded.

The cable company does not put ads on each channels. They rent channels to content providers. Unless you want to donate millions of dollars to a channel's content providers to keep content ad free, you cannot complain. 




 Negating and destroying are two different mechanics. An effect, when activated, is not attached to the card. The best way I can put it is as follows.

Imagine each zone has a su zone that effects go into when a card is activated in that space. Even though the card may be removed or destroyed, it's separate from the effect and the effect is not influenced by what happens to the card. (The ONLY difference is continuous effects. Those cannot apply unless the card is resolved, face-up on the field, and hasn't been destroyed.)

So, to negate an effect, a card effect must specifically go after the effect to affect it. Therefor, cards that only destroy a card do not affect the effects of the cards that are activated. 




 Someone *did* figure it out though. 




 Kind of related

User karma uses color:gray... while other grays on the subreddit uses a different grey (#C6C6C6). For a bit of consistency, and easier to see user karma in header-bottom-right, changing that to #C6C6C6 would be nice too. 




 Oh god, thank you. Now I know she heard me. 




 It's actually a 22.4% grey. That's considered a light grey (below the 40-60 range). 




 Also, So the div.score.unvoted is at #C6C6C6 right now. That's roughly 22.4% on the grey meter. I'd recommend, if a change is implemented, raising it only slightly. Maybe to #D7D7D7 (~16%). I tested it using inspect element. It looks pretty good.

The same applies for comment karma as well. tried it out, looked fine. Althrough, I don't see a problem either way.

 +1. Fast payment. Didn't make a fuss over tiny detail. 




 Emulation is typically used to play old, rare, and out-of-print games whose developers no longer make any money on. It is still technically illegal if you don't own the game, but for those who have the game but have ruined discs or their PS1 no longer works, it's not exactly the devil's work. Meanwhile, piracy in this day is more associated with obtaining recently released media for free through means other than borrowing or getting as a gift. Basically, stealing. Since the media (be it game, movie, or song) is new and still actively makes money for the publisher, it has a more significant impact on publishers. 




 Hence, 

 Half way there 




 "I thought you were the only tigger my nigger." 




 If both Metroid Prime Trilogy and Skyward Swird come in as downloadable, I'll be happy. Half way there. 




 It is absolutely a game worth playing. I play it over when I have the chance. Definitely play it if you get the opportunity. 




 Good luck. I've been trying to unload my Cyber Dragon stuff for weeks. 




 Too bad it's not exactly a key that sends input when pressed. 




 SOMETHING AROUND 55

 I AM SO MAD THAT I CANNOT SELL MY CARDS. EVEN AT A LOSS, I JUST CANNO MOVE THEM. 




 The Asian Kid who got banned I believe is Josh Kwondike Bar 









 I've always gotten mine on eBay. 




 Heart of the Cards. That's pretty much yugioh incarnate. 




 "I could care less."

That means you do care. At least a little. 




 iWant 




 First it will roll out in al paso texes. And then to almost main 2 years later. And people just out of reach will make memes about how sad they are not having it. 




 You missed the point. What goes in the header is not by default or by some rule supposed to be filled with relevant characters. It was voted on by users. Not all entries just plastered modern cards into the header, and the winner could very well be a blank white hole. 




 Having a regular phone isn't a tragedy. The point is, NOT everybody can get and have a working smartphone with service. It's NOT as affordable as the original comment said. 




 I think it's worth watching. There are definitely some intense and rule-bending duels that end up being very epic. Not to mention one of Yugi's duels is simply the definition of SACK! 




 Even poor have smartphones? Because most "smartphones" are made on the cheap and subsidized by plans and most phones owned by the poor are nearly or severely outdated. My friends who are poor don't have smartphones, and one of them doesn't even have a phone plan. 




 After she complained, she probably got bribed by large corporations to keep wages the same. Then she said okay and decided to drop the issue in favor of making herself rich through corporations' so-called "contributions". 




 The header has never been about what deck is relevant. 




 Probably most definitely a bribe. At least when phones and OSX and Linux come out with new versions, it doesn't cost anything, and that's not a 1-year thing. 




 And it will be a free upgrade/downgrade for anyone who knows how to torrent forever. 














 Yeah, remember the days of the Memory card? No need to take your entire system to someone's place. Just your game and memory card. And, if your friend has the game too, you can just bring your memory card to show your progress. And if you lose the game's disc, you still have your data. 




 For Tellarknights, it would be Altair. 




 KOTOR? 









 I really hope she's over 18. Because if not, I'm gonna feel like a terrible pedo. 




 I like how my character is above all of my friend's characters. 









 Nope. I've had three others want it all. I have it split into three chucks which come out to around 110 dollars total. If you want it all, I'd sell it 1 chunk at a time and wait until you receive one portion before selling the next one.

So if you're still interested, PM me. 




 Red flag goes off in my head. 




 What if I told you:

Ads were around this way before they were used for revenue. Companies to not get revenue from ads in a DVD and it is easy to skip them.

To start expecting that all paid services and products should come without ads just because that's the norm digitally is flawed logic. 




 My friends only like Brawl because I don't practice it, so it's the only way they have a remote chance against me (as if). 




 Was just weirded out that someone who likes Brawl as is would be trying mods. Nothing against those who do, just didn't make sense.

Thanks for clarifying the sarcasm.

Speaking of sarcasm, Nana is so tier 0 in 3.5. 




 Because we love Project M. I can't imagine why people who thinks Brawl's gameplay is perfect would feel the need to try its mods when the main purpose of the mods is to change the gameplay. 




 Then why are you here? 




 I actually must disagree. I see many more characters competing with Fox/Falco/C.Falcon etc. It's just easy for Melee players to Pop over, default to fox, and make it feel like Melee+. After all, I barely see fox even win a tournament for Project M. Most of the time it's not even a Melee top tier.

Fox and Falco were not immune to nerfs in their development. I seem to remember reading that they no longer have any frames of invincibility during Shine startup and Fox's Up-smash was nerfed in 3.5. Not to mention, Falco's recovery is still noticeably worse than Melee. And as I recall, everyone thought puff was simply unviable in 3.02 because everyone's recovery was too good. But since everyone's nerfed, puff magically seems better (even though she's not any better than before). 




 That's assuming 100% of Wii's were sold to people who knew it was backwards compatibility AND bought it as a GameCube. I'd imagine that 70 million people who never played video games before bought a Wii because it was also a GameCube (not really). We cannot assume that anybody bought it for that soul reason since it seems only 30 million of past customers even wanted a GameCube. 




 The Wii didn't sell 100 million consoles because it was a GameCube. With that logic, the Gamecube should have also sold 100 million units. 




 start banning only cards that come a dime a dozen so that card prices never go down. 




 They can, but that doesn't mean they will. We have to assume that consoles that had larger install bases will have larger fanbases and more fans who want to play those games again. So, let's count how many gamecubes were sold. Now let's count how many Wiis were sold.

I thought so.

 Then, you just need to not get rid of it on your own. That's what makes Imperior order a bunch of bull. You can just choose not to pay for it then use all the spells you want having still denied your opponent any on his last turn. 




 Fuckers ran off with my lightbulbs as soon as they got the chance. 




 Didn't OSX start requiring 2GB 10.7? If so, then the RAM requirement hasn't actually changed since then. Why are people suddenly finding their macs running badly? 




 I could not give any solid reason as to why I think they will have a better time or even a more successful launch. As it is, it really is just an expensive accessory to an already expensive phone. Well, if you want to get all of its features, you need an expensive phone. But, I think there are reasons for both Apple doing better and Apple doing worse.

Apple will likely have much better marketing. Let's face it, you would be hard pressed to find any proof of other smarteatches being marketed to consumers through consumer channels. I talk about Tv and non-tech internet sights. It will probably boast things the consumer may find useful straight to the consumer and really put it in there face. Not to mention, even non-savy consumers can follow what Apple is doing by watching events on YouTube and following places like /r/Apple. So, much more people may know about it in the first place. Regular consumers like that don't have an easy time following Samsung or Sony with their individual releases. 

The. Again, Apple's watch is not much different from other smart watches feature-wise. And despite this particular watch having a dial, tracking your heart-rate, and being able to switch straps, it doesn't sound too much more intriguing than any other smart watch. Call it what you want, it is still a watch that much stay bound to your wrist out in the open to use its core features.

These are both coming from a hardcore Apple fan who would easily have all of Apple's latest gear if he could afford them.

 In my opinion, the card would simply be more balanced if it didn't allow you to keep a myriad of OP special summoned monsters while denying your opponent any kind of play. 




 Well, Project M has neen recognized as its own separate smash game garnering it's own fan base and competitive scene. It's a Smash game, and it's played on Wii. It's a Wii game. My friends and I are barely aware anymore that Brawl exists. 




 I'm not trying to play against them. I want to learn how to play ICs. 




 He and I are pretty equal. He can only beat me easily with ice climbers, so I have counters for that which prevent him from doing so. I want to learn them to show he's not the only one skilled enough to do so and that I can beat all his characters easily including his counters.

And I love how everyone is just questioning my motives instead of pointing me to a tutorial. Really fucking helpful. 




 I'm not planning to just do dittos. That'd be fucking retarded. Even if we did do dittos, it's obvious that you can't just play it like other match-ups. I want to ruin people's day against their other characters. 




 Because I love ruining people's day. 




 **Supressed "C"**

Level 3 EARTH Insect-type

When your opponent special summons a monster, you can special summon this monster to your opponent's side of the field. This card cannot be used as Xyz or Synchro material. The controller of this card cannot attack with other monsters.

ATK/800 DEF/500

---

**Pendulum Veiler**

Pendulum Scale 9 | 9

*Spell Effect*

When this card is activated: your opponent can choose 1 Pendulum card in their Extra Deck and shuffle it into their Main Deck. If they don't, this card's Pendulum Scale becomes 1.

*Monster Stats*

Level 2 LIGHT Fairy-type monster

During either player's turn, you can discard this card: Your opponent cannot Pendulum summon this turn. Also, any Pendulum card that would be sent to the Extra Deck is Banished instead until the End Phase.

ATK/0 DEF/0 




 I wish my girlfriend would do the same every time I watched Frozen with her. 




 Because, when "smart watches" started to be announced, I never asked a single fucking person if they wanted a computer in a wrist strap that just ties to your phone with a response of "yes". But everyone I know still wishes their devices had better battery life. 




 Quick-Play Spell

 Banish the top card of your deck. Destroy one monster your opponent controls. Monster effects cannot be activated on the same chain as this card.

* Destroys a monster
* Minimal cost
* Prevent bullshit like Shi-en
* Cannot chain the monster effects
* Doesn't target 




 As if Project M was the only good smash bros. game. I'm still looking forward to the other smash tournaments (except Brawl). If SSB, Melee, and Smash 4 are all there, I'll definitely watch those when I can. If not, I'll tune in to see them on Youtube.

This isn't the end of Project M tournaments. They'll still be around. In the mean time, we really should show Nintendo our love for the series by at least trying Smash 4 if we haven't played it already. It gets so many things right where Brawl simply got everything wrong. Really, the only thing I can say I don't like about Smash 4 is the stupid-as-hell Up+B auto-sweet-spot.

Shoutouts the Project M DT for making this awesome game for our enjoyment out of their own free time. 




 Oh god, I really hope Nintendo doesn't try to shut this effort down.

 Yeah, z-indexes are finicky sometimes. I hate fixing something in the z-index, put in a solution that should work and have it have absolutely no effect. Thank goodness this worked without fuss. 




 I see you figured out the problem with the dropdown menus. About time too. I was just about to send a solution. But, the banner ad is still appearing above the actual menu. 




 This should be considered the proper thing to do when people over glorify their kids like that. 




 I think that is why Nintendo wouldn't do it on the current generation. I'd bet that they're quietly working on closing the gap between the power of the home/mobile hardware to be affordable. Basically, it's so you wouldn't *have* to buy both the home console and mobile hardware. If you prefer one over the other, you could just pick on and stick with it.

Nobody wants to see a cross-platform release limit their game. It sucks. 




 Give them a max resolution, and everyone will take advantage of it (if they don't know about design and UI). Not everyone will have ads disabled, and regardless of adblockplus existing, every detail must be taken into account. I have Adblockplus and it doesn't block reddit's ads because (the way reddit's default does it), they are nonintrusive and labeled as ads in a stand-out way so people don't confuse it with an unsponsored link.

The sidebar doesn't need to pop. It's something that regular redditors know is there, and it's not going to change drastically between subreddits.

Don't have to tell me how easy opacity is. This is the stuff I went to school to learn. I have the degree to show for it, too. Now that I'm done tooting my own horn, I'm thinking of possible solutions I think might work. I'll need some time to test them. I might just cheat and look at how Konami did it in the first place. Haha. 




 [](/pinkamina) Mayyybeee. 




 ^^Someone ^^knows ^^Pinkie ^^Pie ^^is ^^my ^^favorite ^^pony 




 I, or any other Konami judge, know how. Feel free to PM if you can't find anyone locally. 




 And you would. But mobile versions of the and games would also be available on a mobile platform. 




 Just read a few things on PSCT and try a few times. Then ask someone who knows how to write in PSCT to proofread. 




 It seems Colin knows to block his name when he mentions his name but not when the other person says it. 




 Melee top tiers exempt from nerfs? Far from it. In Melee, Fox and Falco had a frame of invincibility on the startup of their shines which has been removed on each one. Fox's up smash was drastically reduced so that light characters don't die to him at 50% anymore on average stages. Falco's recovery sucks. That may be a part of brawl they decided to keep for one reason or another but the point still stands. Sheik's combos have been cut down from version 1.0. Marty has had tiny little changes to warrant a different playstyle. Puff, pretty much the same except with some higher knock back on some moves making her combo game much weirder to pull off if ever.

Melee top tiers are not immune to nerfs. But they're designs are bound to their Melee playstyle.

I really think that what PMDT is trying to do is use the Melee top tiers as a guidelines. If PNDT thinks all characters can be as good as Fox and Falco, then at least they should be worth a try. Heck, Hungry Box is even playing puff again. Wiz robe still plays sonic. PK Fire in shield was removed and PK flash doesn't seem to have the same power, but NZA (I take it from him since he's the best Ness I've seen) thinks Ness has actually improved overall.

Just because a character is needed one way does not mean that they are worse. All changes to a character should be taken into account. Everyone can basically live longer against Melee top tiers despite their needed recoveries. 




 This time, can we seriously cut down on the banner height? I'm on a 1080p screen and the banner and the somewhat tall menu take up the first 40% of the screen. Reddit's defaults only take up the first 20%.

And, instead of having alternating themes/banners, runner-ups can be used in the other subreddits such as /r/ygosales and /r/ygobinders and /r/yugiohfeedback. That way we get representation from more than just 1 designer.

Also, still seriously not liking the side-bar. Colors make sense, except for yellow on white which is hard to read. But buttons are simply much bigger than usual buttons and I seems to notice a high reliance on shadows for depth effects. Not exactly an element that Konami uses if we're trying to emulate their look and feel.

The dropdowns on the dropdown menus also seem to have a bit too much transparency. (same goes for the tabmenu.) On pages like these with a lot of text near the menus, the words will be painful to look at. That background making the arrow pointing right should also have a hover property so it looks like it's a complete element. Otherwise, it looks incomplete, or even like an oversight.

(Yes, I'm really going to make a fuss over the UI of this place.)

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/DgdX1rT.png) In here, after the banner ad, half of my screen is taken up. Good UI gets the information to the user and gets out of the way without intruding significantly on the experience. Default reddit CSS doesn't take up nearly as much space (even with the banner ad, it takes up less space than our header alone).
