 This post on flexbox taught me almost everything. It is a very well explained article with excellent visual examples.

 I'm finishing up a project that works on every screen size with flexbox that has only 2 media queries to detect whether you are in portrait or landscape mode. It's crazy.  









 Adobe is trying some neat things with edge animate. 




 I agree in that this is something I would do as well, however I can respect someone for creating something useful to keep them focused and immersed in their work and sharing it. I can never learn that lesson. For example, here I am on reddit again instead of finishing the last 25% of that mindmap I've been putting off. 




 All of tech feels that way for everyone eventually. Before the internet we used to animate stuff in [Macromedia Director](http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-Director-Dummies-Computer-Tech/dp/0764502247) because every serious business gave out presentation CD's at trade shows. Then the internet came around and prodigy wasn't fast enough for 600 megabyte movie files, which is seriously all the space you are ever going to need my 17-year-old self from the past is trying to remind me.

I don't know what existed before Director. Probably the solitary madness of nothing. 




 Reddit is amazing. Not 20 minutes ago I was thinking how great the art was on the ingame cards as the storm coast sat loading and behold!  









 Color me excited! There aren't enough horror games it's awesome to see one coming that looks mind blowing

 Take a look at this color ramp generator. Its not perfect but by the time you learn its limitations you'll be a color pro http://www.pixelfor.me/crc 




 Nice looking frontpage :D 









 Your devs... on the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION?! 




 Nevermind I'm dumb :) 









 A little bit of microdata can go a long way. [Google even has a simple tool](https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/) to get you started.
 




 Paper and a pencil. Mechanical of course, I'm not some sort of animal.  




 Googles microdata tool is extremely limited. It's a good place to start and you can grasp how it works very quickly with it, but move on to https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html for all the goodness it can offer.  




     git commit -am 'HEY CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO COMMIT WITH COMMENTS I CAN NOT REMEMBER!' 




 This looks amazing, thanks! 









 What if it just effects results when searching on a mobile device?

 I left the guild thinking I was bugged and would rejoin. Any chance you could re-add me @wossname

If not I'll go find how to get back in, I didn't want to pollute the google doc by filling it out a 2nd time and causing issues with it. 




 Ah got it. That must be frustrating for guild leaders, I imagine you get this complaint a lot. 




 I found some that are all the books, I want one that syncs with my game so I just have the ones I collect. Immersion and all that :) 




 I know right? Zenimax feel free to hire me to make this. 




 As an app developer myself I'm still sad more companies don't do companion apps, or at least make some API's so we can put stuff out. 

I really want an ESO app that lets me read all the lore books I find in the world while I'm offline :) 




 Don't be. It is in line with my sense of humor :) 




 When you are in a production environment with a full workload production  details. When you aren't in that environment the details matter. If it appears that you don't care about the details it appears that you don't care about the quality of the work.

In this case (the graphic_design subreddit) the details should matter. 




 My penis is so small I couldn't even render it with 1 pixel.
