 I'm glad a total internet stranger seems so confident in my abilities! :)  I will say, depression has a way of making you feel like you are the worst person on earth (by "you" i mean like a general "you"...not you yourself... ha). Topped with the insecurities I already had... it is not a pretty sigh over here.  




 Makes me feel better to hear that from someone.  The doctor was like "You should feel great in a week!"...Uhhh...I do not. Not even close!
