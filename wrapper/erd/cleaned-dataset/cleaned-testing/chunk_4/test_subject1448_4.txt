   I remember reading this ''theory'' in the internet a long ago. It just came into my mind today, then I thought it is worth to share with this subreddit.

 Ok, by first we need to remember one thing: our brain is *old*. But, what does it means old? It means that, after all our evolution as *Homo sapiens*, we still share the same brain *instincts* with our folks of 20.000 years ago. Yes, in our civilized lives of today, they may be even more hidden in our often occupied minds, but the thruth is: we, as a species, act more by instinct than we think.

  An example that shows how we act by instinct is when we feel attracted to a person. The fact that you felt attracted by that woman in the other side of the street isn't just because she is gorgeous. This is your instincts acting man! When you looked at her, your instincts *tell* you that she could be a capable female that will give you healthy offspring, and this healthy children will be able to expand your genes to the world. This is a great mark that shows how we act as *animals*, even in a such civilized world.

  But, not escaping from the topic: what does the instincts that we still share with our 20.000 years old folks has to do with the casual sightings of ghosts? This can be explained by this example:

  Imagine you're a caveman, 20.000 years ago. It is night, and from the deep of the jungle, you rear a *crack*. You move to the entrance of your cave and try to see, in the pitch black, what has done that sound. Now let's imagine that, what made the sound is a tiger, that followed you to your cave, and that failed in a sneak attack. You can't see nothing and you have no idea what is out there. 

  Now, the thing is: your **unconscious** feels that you are in danger and that he needs to do something to avoid this. The unconscious then, *creates* a image in the pitch black, trying to fool you that there is something out there and that you need to RUN. This is the instincts acting, the instinct of *danger*. When our unconscious feels that our body is in danger, he is able to do those certain things. Now just adjust this example for the actual scenario:

  You're home alone and hear a noise. At this point, our unconscious starts detecting that we *might* be in danger. You start feeling uneasy and nervous, this is just a boost to our unconsious to think that we are really in danger. People often say that they saw something moving in the end of a corridor and things of the sort, but this is just our unconscious acting. 

  For a resume, the things that we often resemble as ghosts are just our brain trying to protect us from a possible danger.
  
  Edit: I'll just like to add that: this theory is not for debunking stories and this sort of thing. I love paranormal stories. I just wrote this to try to clear that many casual sightings are caused by this brain activity, and should not be confused with ghosts. 




 So sorry m8, saw thes video, got so excitd, posted on reddit ayyy lmao 




 Ah sheit 









 What's I spy by the way? 




 Shadow of the colossus. If not the best game ever, it is certainly the best PS2 game. Never a game had such artistical meanings behind it, and the scenarios are astonishing. It really needs a movie. 




 When did black people went to school? At it construction. 




 The best way to get over a relationship that didn't worked quite right is being open for new ones. 




 Absolutely.
 




   I live in the 6th floor of an building, and she in the 3rd floor. We have very similar schedules, for this reason I always find myself in the elevator with her. In the short time we are there, we stay in silence, just summarizing in a ''bye'' after the elevator reaches a certain level where one of us has to exit.
  I really need ideas of how to start a conversation with her, related to our building, her apartment or even college...




TL;DR: Ideas for a conversation opener with a girl I only see in a short time in the elevator.
