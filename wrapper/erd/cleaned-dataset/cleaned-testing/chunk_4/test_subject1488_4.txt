 I'm so excited for you! I wish someone would ask me out. If you're east coast, your have two hours. Will expect an update. 




 It's just how you view it. Embrace the whitey in yourself and all will flourish. 




 Fuck that. I praise the sun and take in all it's rays. 




 Thank you for this post because now I know what I'm going to make for dinner!!!

The answer is.......


French toast!
Wanna come over? 




 I've become a little more apathetic. I think this has to do with my ability to get 3.0 GPA (minimum) without trying AT ALL. I'm very good at playing the system, and my college is not hard in general. So, I really don't care about walking out of class or skipping or giving a fuck about what I wear, how people perceive me, how many friends I have on campus, etc. If i feel it's not worth my time, i won't show up. If I think a professor is ridiculous I won't show up or I'll let my voice be heard. I guess this is part of adulthood and synonymous with independence.

Also, I learned it's okay to think outside the box and your opinions actually ARE what professors want to hear. I've been lucky to take a handful of classes with professors that let you (and expect you) to be free with your thought. Some of the things I wrote seem like I'm high out of my mind, but it's really just me digging deeper and making connections that I've been forced to not look into in other classes. 




 I'll spin it tomorrow 




 I've been Into exploration as well and started metal detecting. Great way to see the outdoors and float around to new places/hidden gems in your area. 




 It's PEMDAS. Parentheses, exponent, multiplication or division (left to right), addition or subtraction (left to right). 




 The answer is 6. Parentheses first, then division and multiplication left to right.
2*3=6 




 Have you talked to your doctor about antidepressants? They often help with anxiety all together, rather than a quick fix like xanax. Same with your focus, really will help on a low dose.

I've been on my share of antidepressants that have changed my levels of anxiety. I've found when I'm on a pill that completely removes anxiety, I am unproductive and boring. Anxiety kind of forces me to multitask and complete things fully and quickly. I manage every little detail which is why I do so well, esp at jobs.
 




 Yeah I just got off from work and headed to some more spots today. Got too messy in my work clothes and shoes so headed home. Going big tomorrow on my day off though!! 




 I am definitely getting better each time I dig a plug! Luckily where I've been has either been my own property or land that's otherwise not well kept so I can hide my mistakes for now! 




 $loan $150.00 




 Thanks for the welcoming. Went out today for 2.5 hours, multiple place. just kept finding beer can and rocks! and 11c! I will not be discouraged, heading to the beach tomorrow! 




 Having trouble, can send you something via paypal if you have one. 




 dark net 




 garbage men 




 Yup. End of thread. 




 Been there. Look at /r/opiatesrecovery 
If you can't do it alone colt turkey, try lupe or kratom. If that doesn't work, get suboxone from a sub clinic.. Of course rehab is a possibility.

Get yourself to a counselor as well because issues aren't just on the surface.

You'll be good, stay positive. 




 It 100% pays off being nice! I will go out of my way for any nice guest and do it with a great attitude. For a complaining guest, I'll try my best to make you happy because its my job! And, I love the feeling of turning a rude customer to a nice grateful customer. I usually will not be overly nice though. And next time I won't be as happy as I could be.

physical contact is necessary. Plus, helen keller could get by, so can  i! 




 I've had mine dismantled and can reassure you.... it is. 




 I will dismantle your heart. 




 ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING YOURSELF AS TRIBUNE? 




 That's awesome. Artificial sweeteners have a similar effect on the GI system.

I want to try a chip. 




 Omg your answers are in sync with my brain. This is a hard breakup but I support your decision. 




 This is down the road from me. Always makes me smile when social media posts it around. 




 Chelsea smile.. 




 Oh and do you want to be my boyfriend?  




 Did you tell her what you told us? 




 What is your name? I feel like I dated you... (See below) 




 I want to live as minimally as possible but feel like this is a big step moving out. Thanks for the encouragement though. 




 taco bell veggie cantina bowl. my stomach right now... send help... 




 Worked for me once. I didn't really care either way though and my boss was a great pal. 




 it's like soured milk chunks 




 Canada's fries-- fries, gravy, cheese curds. 




 definitely recommend yak and yeti! WOuldn't go to Be out Guest. Just mediocre. 




 Ya I graduate in less than a month. Freaking out but trying to remain optimistic and stand my ground. Focus on right now, rather than finding a career for the rest of my life.

As far as motivation, maybe you'd like to talk to a doctor about getting on a mild antidepressant. I don't think you're necessarily depressed but rather in a rut going through an existential crisis. 




 Because I'd want to save it to make pinky promises.

And if want my left ring finger for marriage. 




 Probably a pinky on one finger and the ring finger on the other.

So 200k. 




 I think you new to do some soul searching. Explore, spend time alone, spend time with strangers, travel, take up new hobbies or volunteer. After this, Make a list of your positive traits and what you find you like or value. 

If you don't have a job, get one even if it's not a "career" and work hard at it to make you feel confident. Plus it takes time away from dwelling on your problems and puts your energy into something else other than anxiety.

Think about your "virgin" situation. Do you want to have sex for yourself or because you think it's what you NEED to do (just like you NEED to get a job out of college)? If it's the former, go right ahead and pursue that but know it's not going to solve any problems.

Other than that, someone once told me to not worry about what you're going to do to create happiness for the rest of your life but rather focus on what makes you happy in your current life. (I probably and wording this wrong) 

Good luck I've been there and overcome some of the problems that you've mentioned but still right there with you on others. 
 




 Whole situation is stupid. Don't pay her and ignore this train wreck of a person. 




 The song I don't mind. The intro video is what kills me. It's so long and pretty old now. They should just have a scene at the bar as an intro or something. 




 exercise. That's all I got. 




 amazing. As I graduate with a B.S. in Business Admin, I'm realizing I am more intrigued with a career along the lines of social work. Any advice? Are there any entry level positions you think I'd be qualified for without any social work background right now? Or, any similar career paths you think would suit someone interested in helping people, dealing with children and human science? 




 Yes, that's why we keep having sex. 

Gotta cut him out soon. 




 I'm a girl and would probably do it but not get into a relationship. It's his choice and I'm not the only one to blame. 




 No this sounds weird as hell. Not normal, tell her to stop. 




 Probably cost efficiency.

I actually live near next to 6 and think 7 is also a great place to live if you like heat.

You can get a job where I live as a waiter anywhere. 1600E is $2000+ America? That'd get you a pretty good apartment here with at least $500 spending money. But this obv changes by location in the US. I'd say the average where I like is $1000USD, so maybe 800E.

Up north, you don't really feel the racism. Down South, it's a little different. I wouldn't really say it's that racist or segregated, but people do have different views than what us in the North view difference races. What you hear about shootings happen, but no, it's not like that. There's rape and mugging but it's not something we should be known for. Inner cities you'll find more or it.

Don't live in Compton or NYC.

 




 No. My mom used to be just like yours and when I was too young to go to the bathroom myself, I remember her putting enough TP to clog the toilet on the rim of the seat. Now I just squat depending on the cleanliness. Most of the time if it looks clean and well maintained, I just sit right down. I don't care.

Once a year I put a cover on just to reminisce about my childhood and because they look fun. 




 Thanks for posting, you're giving me a lot of courage. Italy seems much more doable than the other places I listed. Sounds like a challenge planning and going alone but I'm certainly going to look into it.

 He's probably the happiest guy I ever met, never once yelled and just so helpful and friendly overall. I for want to let him down or disobey him because he deserves respect and doesn't need my hassles or bullshit.  




 I just grab coffee in my car. 




 Spray poopouri or another perfume/febreeze in the toilet before you go and flush. 




 Sounds like you have an anxiety disorder. Maybe talking it out with someone, even a friend, will help. 




 Probably testosterone and ability to build muscle easier. 




 Why don't you ask the people you're living with how they feel? Id rather have the 3bdrm but I'm not living there. 




 Kinda just want to get high and converse. 




 It's much, much more acceptable than calling guys "boys." Just a synonym for me. I don't have a problem with it. 




 Wow this is extremely interesting. If I go to my psychiatrist and ask for your script, what do you think would happen? Would I need to do a tap? We've tried 3 antidepressants and I'm not doing great, I wonder if he'd give it a try. 




 Girl. I can be a grill if you're into that shit, oh yeah bb 




 You probably don't want to hear this but I 100% think it should be required to go to a community college for 1 or 2 years and take some gen eds right out of high school, then transfer. It saves money and gets you focused, both with the college atmosphere and your future wants and needs. If you wanna be away, you can always get an apartment, rent out a room near a college and be on your own. 




 Lmao thanks that's the one
