 It's these posts that remind me, and I reckon that's a good thing.

I miss my Dad, yet I only have to watch a game to hear him.

I didn't know that love lasts longer than life, till he was gone. 




 :) 




 Miss mine too, the smiley bollox ;)

 




 My guess is Monday will lead to a few more. Though the voting for who is on it will just start again, and then there will be a new government majority. 

If it was just going to be a chance to tarnish FF with the details, you'd imagine Enda wouldn't be too bothered about the panel's make-up. So I'm guessing there are a few shameful deeds from the current government that need to brushed under the carpet.

He's like a school-teacher who has been given the troublesome students, and now doesn't want anyone to know they've gotten worse under his watch. 




 Good read

Mr Donnelly warned that Taoiseach Enda Kenny can now set the inquiry's terms of reference, decide who is questioned, exclude certain events from consideration and **even veto the final report.**

I wish someone would find definitive evidence that Enda was in league with Alan Shatter over Garda cover-ups, then we could have a GE sooner rather than later.

Do we have to wait for a full omni-shambles, like Cowen's government, before we get there?  




 Well shit Tony, you probably shouldn't have hitched your political legacy to [establishing new 'faith' schools](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/02/education.labour).

You've got to be gobsmacked by someone who creates a new local problem but then tries tells everyone the problem is a global, not-invented-here, one.

He's a new definition for 'punch-magnet'. 









 It's a pity, but then this inquiry has been turned into a shambles.

Imagine how much in-fighting there's going to be later at the report stage when even the terms of reference garner so much political bullshit.

I wonder will the 'lost' bank guarantee documents ever turn up? They're bound to be in a German government office somewhere. 




 For some context, the writer Paul Williams was named in the Dil, by TD Joan Collins, as someone who had their penalty points wiped.

It's also curious that the "Dublin-based security consultant" he cites remains anonymous throughout the article.

I think this [caricature](http://i2.wp.com/www.rabble.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-10-at-13.28.49.png?resize=640%2C651) does him justice. 









 Calm down there Nora, ya crazy breeder.

/oops 









 I'm not sure either way if McGuiness overstepped the bounds of his role by suggesting resignations. I imagine he's supposed to wait till the PAC produces its report. Though that sounds extremely frustrating.

Anyway, is there not an equivalency between McGuinness 'politicising' the PAC, and Enda unilaterally creating a majority on the Banking Inquiry terms-of-reference panel?

Surely if McGuinness is at fault, then Enda is too?

Am I getting this wrong or has Enda reached new bionic-asshole levels of hypocrisy? 





























 I reckon the raw data would be needed to be certain, plus won't the next Dil have less TDs? I wonder if that has been factored in. 




 Up at the top and in the middle column:

"Past vote weighted and adjusted for spiral of silence" which I'm assuming is what point #5 in the first slide means.

"weighting back 50% undecided to how they voted in past elections" - They looked at previous polls and examined how the "Don't knows" ultimately voted in previous general elections and then added that trend into the results. So the difference between the number of first preferences in the new poll and the final seat tally is a combination of the new poll's data weighted for the likely decisions of the "Don't knows" on election day. 




 I think it's mentioned on the first slide at the link, [bullet #4 about weighting](http://i1.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article3680082.ece/alternates/s2197/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-125037.png) the results based on previous poll data.

Also, the fourth slide shows how they extrapolated this new poll data to likely general election seats. 









 But without looking at 'effective' tax rates how would we know the reductive impact of loop-holes on multi-nationals' tax rates? 




 Well that's one way to look at it, here's another:

[Ireland could be in for a windfall, if multinationals here are found to be paying less than their fair share of corporation tax, but the country could also face losing its attraction for such global giants.](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/multinational-tax-regime-under-threat-from-eu-271338.html)

And at 12.5%, we would still be more attractive than many other EU countries. We would also create some breathing room for Irish companies that want to compete with multi-nationals. 




 Yeap, over [7 years](http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/google-pays-just-014-tax-in-seven-years-28945199.html) that's all they paid. 




 Enda said 

our legislation is very strong and **ethically implemented** and we will defend that robustly.

How are effective tax rates ethical when Irish companies pay 12.5% while it's 0.14% for Google and 3.7% for Apple? How is it ethical for an Irish government to treat Irish companies with this disadvantage?

We can't compete in these areas because of the huge advantage given to these companies. If an Irish government wants a vibrant, successful home-grown IT sector - then don't stack the deck against them.

Irish companies employ the vast majority of people in Ireland 70%. That's the sector we should be helping.

edit: The official press release for the investigation - http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-663_en.htm 
 









 Mr Justice Cooke found as not convincing the accounts that an **wireless AV remote control device for audio and video equipment in GSOC** was connecting and transferring data to an external Bitbuzz hotspot in a nearby caf.

So that was the type of wireless device everyone was wondering about - a remote. And GSOC were certain they'd no Wifi devices in their office. Did they not know the equipment came with a wifi remote? Why were Verrimus worried about it then? It's good to have the report done,  better have a look at [all of it](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2014/06/gsoc-report-final-redacted.pdf) though.

edit - Plenty to read in there:

9.81. The Commissioners expressed the view that the suggestions made in the Rits Report
seeking to undermine the Verrimus Reports are not credible. Furthermore, **the series
of third party efforts made to influence the evidence to be given to the Inquiry by
Verrimus are unexplained and of concern.** They expressed the view that There is no
credible expert opinion that disputes the existence of the threats identified by
Verrimus.

Well, it looks like getting Rits involved was the BS move many thought it was.
 









 Oh, I'd forgotten about that. Cheers! 









 Update: Will be discussed at cabinet tomorrow.

 They'd have to teach Enda how to use encryption first, and I'm guessing they gave up on that. 




 ["Whilst local laws do not expressly prohibit disclosure, **we asked the authorities for guidance and have been** informed that we cannot disclose this information."](http://www.thejournal.ie/vodafone-government-refusals-makey-uppy-law-1502972-Jun2014/)



 




 There are quite a few decisions that the Irish Data Protection Commissioner should be ashamed of, then again his government isn't investing in his position or powers.

As we can see from [the opulent office](http://www.thedata.co/sites/thedata.co/files/u1/Irish_Data_Protection_Comissioner.png) they gave him outside Dublin, in Portarlington.

This is where the data protection law compliance of Google, Facebook et al are supervised.

It's no wonder the law is changing. 




 No, the Irish Government prevented Vodafone from releasing the data. 




 It's like there was a wilful misinterpretation of Jesus' "suffer the little children" - he did not mean to make children suffer.

What kind of fucking 'christians' were these people?  









 Yeah, the amount of suspicious certs Convergence warns about is scary. 




 BT and Vodafone/C W also operate extensive long distance optical fibre communications networks throughout the UK, installed and paid for by GCHQ, NSA, or by a third and little known UK intelligence support organization called the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC).

I imagine you mean activities like the above. I'm not claiming they're beyond reproach - but we don't see O2, Eircom etc. rushing to tell us how many requests they receive. Vodafone wanted to give us more info, it's the Irish government that stopped them. 




 Here's another link:

again, please forgive source 




 Considering Vodafone have volunteered this info, I think they're trying to warn people that there's more going on than we know. 




 But will the government let you know every last detail about what they're up to? No.

So why give them an advantage when they won't return the favour?

Look at our Garda, do you think they'll only check phonecalls because they genuinely have a reason for the search or also because there's a cover-up made easier that way?

You seem quite happy to let the government have a good snoop at people's lives if they think they should. What makes you think you can trust them? 




 .. or If you've nothing to hide then why are they already looking at you?

or If they've nothing to hide then why aren't we looking at them?

Privacy isn't becoming a big issue, it always was a big issue, as well as a human right. People don't need privacy just to hide criminal acts. They need it for dignity, to avoid blackmail, to keep trade secrets and to protect their friends   family.

Run your life with as little of it as possible if it means that little to you. You can start with your real name   address right here :) 




 Be one with the [flow](http://a.gifb.in/072011/1310386317_corgi_on_a_swing.gif), then they will come.

 He's texting on his nokia, isn't he?! 




 Certainly, and we can't all become experts in every field - so we rely on news outlets to at least do some hours of research before coming to conclusions.

It's probably not an example of sinister politics but these 'lazy journos' will become unwitting stooges if they (or we) don't cop on.

e.g.

RT: "Analysis of the cases shows people treated for this infection **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

thejournal.ie: "People treated for VTEC **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

The original [HSE report](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Campaigns/wellsepa.html): "**Analysis of cases shows that people treated for VTEC are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

There's nothing wrong with quoting a report, but they both seem to avoid it.

Interestingly enough, the HSE report cites its own sources which in [2009](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/Factsheet/) makes no specific mention of private water-wells as a vector (though this coincides with the EPA's reporting period of its 30% claim) while another HSE source from [Oct 2013](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/VTECandwater/) - leads to a claim that "Untreated private water supplies are an important method of spread: VTEC patients are **3 or 4 times more likely** to consume untreated well or other private water than people who do not develop VTEC".

Nevermind the statistical weirdness of comparing VTEC via one vector versus those with no infection, rather than those with VTEC infections via other means.

Anyway, it looks like vague reporting based on skimmed reports compounded by out-of-date and conflicting reporting periods. May as well throw in political interference, it's a mess anyway. 




 Aye, Air Quality measurement and reporting was my job for a while.

There's no chance I would have kept the job by asserting dangers with data that old.

At best I think these reports are overstating a known issue, at worst I think they're serving a viewpoint that does not have any current evidential support.

What I do believe is certain is that RT   the.journal et al have copy and pasted rather than spend an hour or two looking at the source data / reports.

I think the OP is on point with regard to a 'lazy journalism' approach from RT etc.

Is it on point with regard to a politically vested interest, who knows? In RT's case it wouldn't be the first time.

I don't think these concerns should be dismissed automatically.  




 Pity it's not a water quality report. 




 Room-temp fusion, or GTFO 




 Ya won't have the advantage of interpretive dance though ;) 




 In fairness, it's not like they'll pay for the parking themselves. 




 Would seem like a stretch, wouldn't it? As for the EPA, I've no clue - but RT toeing the government line is not a new feature. They'll just do what they're told.

Hard to credit 5 year old data being so worthy of attention though, especially considering that private wells are not the main source of VTEC infections.

I'm sure there will be barbeque / food-safety PSAs soon which will address the major source. 




 T is best news agency, was once only agency - those were days my friend.

Children were cattle, cattle were profit, bullshit was money and the church was wealthy. 




 Very possibly, though we don't know how much the water will cost per litre yet ;)

Though for [the numbers](http://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/want-to-dodge-water-bills-with-a-well-heres-the-drill-30053308.html), it's around 4,500 to 5,000 - you can get a grant which will cover no more than 2,031.58. So around 3,000 all in.

If water charges are at the estimated 420 per year, then ~7 years using as much water as you like! Of course if the water charges go up, then it would take less time to recoup the investment. Plus it won't have that taste of treatment. 




 Based on data from 2007 to 2009, strange that it's news now. 




 Cheers, though the E.Coli. data has no context for the likely contamination vector. Plus the EPA's data covers 2007-2009, strange that it's in the news now.

I'm calling bullshit on this one. Well-water is undoubtedly a contributory source but by no means **the** only source of concern. It's not even the main source of infection, that would be food. 




 There was a u-turn on that one after the uproar:

http://www.freedominfo.org/2013/11/irish-minister-changes-course-on-fees-for-foi-requests/

I'm sure they'll try again when they think no-one's looking.
 




 I've been looking around for the report that's mentioned but can't find it at:

http://www.epa.ie/water/dw/hhinfo/ 

Does anyone know where it is? 




 They've been in a sputtering phase for a while:

http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-fall-of-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-death-of-republican-ideas/279955/ 

Though preventing Europe from acting as a bloc will always be on the US wish-list, regardless of the think-tank. 




 Yeah, I think it's a sponsored piece by Vodaphone. Which I notice the Irish Times has in its 'Sponsored Section' while the gang in the Irish Examiner have in its main news section, cheeky. 




 The moves are said to have caused outrage among newsroom staff who argue that the unpredictable nature of news gathering often means last-minute taxis have to be booked.

Or buy some second-hand cars with the savings from not getting taxis and flying first   business class. You know, rocket science. 














 Just as well (hurr) I get mine checked every year.

Calm down Volvic, it's purer than yours. 




 Among the cables specifically identified in one document as currently being intercepted or on cover are an Irish connection, **Hibernia Atlantic**, landing in Southport, and three European connections landing at Yarmouth, Dover, and Brighton.

Which I imagine is this [Hibernia Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia_Atlantic), who provide "financial customers and the trading community low-latency routes to financial exchanges and data centers" and it's all starting to make sense now why they're tapped. 




 Cool agus groovy, but keep it down. 




 Apologies, did upvote it! I just couldn't resist the quote when I read it today - summed up the problems in one go. 









 Sounds like complete BS, but every group has its idiots 




 If it's the 'local lunatics' you mean - then my town has a few plastic-bag men. They just walk around most days, frequently with a plastic-bag that has little or nothing in it. Though perhaps it's for company or purpose on the huge amount of walking they all do.

There's probably a business opportunity there for people who need their dogs walked, and for these poor souls to have better company on their walks, plus a bit of canine therapy.

I think the Fall had a song about them, 'Carrier-Bag Man', decades later they're still going around. 




 You'd imagine the Data Protection Commissioner has already looked at it.

 You'd have to be really thirsty to trust that.

 Robert Zubrin does pieces on politics as well as manned Mars missions? Did not know. 




 Here's a recipe:

http://www.cashelblue.com/official-recipe/cashel-blue-steak-and-chips/  




 Which is one part of voting for the EPP I don't understand, from the above link:

* Strengthening of the common immigration and asylum policy and integrating immigrants

Voting for an EPP candidate means increasing the chances that someday immigration is dealt with by a central, federal authority - not nationally.

A possibility I imagine a lot of FG voters wouldn't like.

We can see it in France where the huge vote for the Front National stemmed from this very issue. Marine Le Pen has made stopping further EU integration her #1 priority because she believes the EU will take that national immigration decision away.

Front National scare me much more than the EPP, though I reckon a lot of people in Ireland would want to keep immigration decisions at the national level just like FN do - yet have voted EPP anyway. 




 Let's cut to the [real reason Enda](https://i.imgur.com/5HcjHTD.jpg) 




 Bring O'Reilly a few coffees will ya? 




 Yeah, that seems to be the issue.

And there's raw data on the site, so back later ...

edit:

So a quick little copy   paste of the raw data excluding city councils, http://pastebin.com/cfDCq00d, and Meath's spend per capita is the lowest in the country!! It must be the lack of people, historical attractions or vast distance from Dublin.

If there's a better place to post excel sheets, please let me know. 




 Ah, my mistake.

However Monday or no, the country expects appropriate apostrophes. 




 Jaysus, Meath underspend on **every** category compared to the national average. Housing, environment   recreation all seem to have the most underspend - which makes sense when you go around the place.

That said my local town is much improved during this period of austerity. It's hard to believe the state it was in while the boom era money flowed. Goes to show how much mismanagement was going on and more to be done apparently. 




 Oh very true, but as long as the survey was carried out properly - it is better than guessing. 




 Enda, back to 'work' 




 I wonder if that question was rephrased to 'do you support further transfer of competencies to Europe' what the answers would have been like?

There's so many good findings in that report, I wouldn't have expected a greater portion of FF voters against same-sex marriage than FG for instance - though the country overall is in favour. 




 Remind yourself to always read the question two or three times before starting your answer.

Also, the initial surge in adrenalin / panic at the start of an exam subsides after ~15 mins. So if you spend the first 15 mins, checking the questions you're going to answer and preparing them. You should feel much calmer for the rest of it.

Source, my uni wouldn't allow us to write for the first 15 minutes of an exam.

 I think this is the best idea. Plus a proper tree surgeon will be able to see a way to thin the trees, if the trees' shapes allow.

So the height could be more or less kept but enough space cleared to provide light - possibly a dappled light. 




 I hope you lose ya gobshite, and maybe just maybe you will:

TV3, represented by Marcus Dowling BL, opposed the application. It was argued the  Minister, in seeking to amend his claim, was seeking to "gloss over" serious factual  inaccuracies in his original statement of claim. These inaccuracies had not been properly explained by the Minister, counsel added.

Mr Justice Paul Gilligan ruled the Minister was entitled to amend his statement of claim. The case will be listed for hearing before a Judge and jury at a future date. 









 He does give off an aura of being at 'arms length' from the seedy side.

Yet then there's Denis O'Brien, Chris Dodd   the SI, O'Reilly's health centre locations vs Roisn Shorthall ... he's not shy about political favours 




 If Alan Shatter's shenanigans get linked to Enda, that could be sooner rather than later.

 There's probably still enough push in a regular door to see an envelope get to the Isle of Man. 




 I'll go with Mint as well, the KDE version for added eye candy. 









 You're not wrong.

Meanwhile Sherlock, a TD for Cork East, has re-entered the race having **earlier this week ruled himself out** of both the leader and deputy leadership contests.

I want to [be] part of the process of renewal of this party, he said in a statement.

To do that I feel that the position of deputy leader will allow me to assist to rebuild the organisation. 

I believe I have the energy and the capability to try this agenda with a new party leader and I look forward to the election taking place.

http://www.thejournal.ie/alan-kelly-labour-leader-bid-1491106-May2014/

He sounds like a boiler-plate covering letter for a job application, and the infinitives - ahhhh. 









 So we know Callinan covered-up the problems in the Garda, we know Alan Shatter failed in his duty to investigate those problems (negligence or cover-up) plus that they were close professionally and now all that's left is what Enda knew and did?

That's the whole deal here, isn't it?

If Enda can be linked to the cover-ups / negligence of Callinan  /or Shatter his position as Taoiseach would be very shaky.
