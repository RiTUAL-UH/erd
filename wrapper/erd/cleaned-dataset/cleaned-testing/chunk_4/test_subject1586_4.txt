 And this got downvoted to heck. Case in point. Thanks for the side bar. looks great. Also, That dude on the other thread who deleted all of his posts, yeah, that guy was spouting off about reporting everyone to the Browns mods, and to the reddit mods. Good luck with the rest of your season, all. 




 I think the Green Bay Packers and the Bears might be longer, but ours is far, far, far more brutal and almost as long. 




 And most of the trolling I saw was on the thread that was named "At least I can feel my Browns hate again" which made me think it was a place for some trash talk when I saw what folks were saying. And I went total brat-mode, but I wasnt derogatory.  




 Browns fan here. Totally bantering, but as a rule I try not to ever vote on other teams lists, and I havent thrown a slur, but some really aggro people from this list go to instantly accusing folks of "Vote Brigading" (which is a cool term I had never heard before) even though some of us follow reddiquette. Not saying I havent voted, just that I vote consciously and not to just punish a post, and I reiterate: I try to follow a rule of not voting on other subs. But are we really telling on each other and getting in a twist? We are telling the REDDIT MODS? Really? We are supposed to be like Goku and Vegita. (We're Goku) and we love to hate each other, and we take our lumps from each other, and we do it with pride and honor. *EDIT I can hate you, but I actually tell other teams fans when they get shitty about you guys, that they need to shut their mouths, because they dont know you well enough to hate you like that.* Come on. Brothers who kick the shit out of each other, but going to mom and tattling? We're better than that. Let's handle things in house and just duke it out when need be. Buck up. You've done this 18 of the last 20 times. That being said: Why isnt the sidebar changed for our bet? *Edit: And I upvoted this thread* 




 I just tried it out with some of the Pork I am cooking, and it got done in around an hour and a half at 350. Redux was chardonnay. Mirepoix was carrot, garlic, and mushroom (onion allergy coming to the event and didnt have celery) and then did a Bouquet Garni of thyme rosemary and sage. It turned out amazing. I have a picture on my phone that WONT UPLOAD. Thank you all for your help. I'll try to share some pics in an update after the event!

 Mine came in the bedroom and said "Celebrate?" and then we did. 




 Check out the thread entitled "At least I can feel my Browns hate flowing again" Very funny, and somewhat heart warming to have a rivalry REALLY happening over there. 




 This thread is titled "At least I can feel my Browns hate flowing again" [I'm helping.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/052/012/helping.png)
 




 Because folks say he seems like Brady in the way he dissects a defense, but he is the polar opposite of Brady in that he connects with a SHIT TON of long passes. imo 




 Dont you guys have a sidebar bet to deal with? I think our Mods have probably figured out what they want. Good game, y'all! Welcome back to the rivalry.
 




 Well, that's like your opinion, man. You really brought Harrison back? I mean, I like Cribbs and all, but... 




 Facts! 




 that hot air held the ball aloft for 31 points. Loser ass Cleveland Browns and their score of 58-13 in the last 6 quarters against the Steelers.
 




 Today was actually a BLAST to watch, imho.
 




 I think it was when Turkey Jones dropped Bradshaw (bless his heart) 




 *Or r/steelers, whatever* 














 Oh my god and goddess this is amazing. 




 He's on my team and my name needs to reflect his awesomeness. Totally scabber ChristianMingoDOTcom, but I run Hoyer every week, and I never run the CLE Defense. Suggestions? 




 I think Williams just got hurt stopping Brown. 




 This. ^^ 




 *Sips his iced vanilla soy latte with no whip* There just isnt enough of a sample size to truly say that Brian Hoyer isn't a fluke. He just doesn't have the arm strength to be anything but a game manager. *burns his lip and spills his latte on his lap* 




 Derp dee derp derp derp. 




 Nice try, Leon. 




 The kitchen has a full steam pan serving area, and my plan is to have it come out right at 20 minutes before doors open for dinner. 




 I like this idea. I am guessing Braising is going to be the way to go. It will be my first venture into braising, which explains why I didn't know how to do this without help. I like this idea. I have to keep it soy free and gluten free, so it will be a corn starch or arrowroot thickener. Wine might be a good idea. It was going to be Rosemary for one, and Thyme Parsley for the other meal and then all three for the third meal. (Keeping it as simple as possible for on site cooking) 




 The beef is top round, and the pork is whole leg. I have access to steam tables. I want to get it done as close to serving time as possible. And thank you for y'alls time. *edit spelling and thank you* 




 We are doing a harvest festival and I am in charge of the kitchen. Instead of cutting the meat small, I have cut the meat in large, rustic chunks of about 2-2 1/2 inches cubed. I want to serve 4 or 5 on the plate with the meal. My question is: What is the besy way to cook the meat? Roasting? Stewing? Pan cooking(which sounds very time consuming)? Or what? Im not sure. I have 3 meals to make like this, so I have to do this three times. I am a really good cook, so I can do just about anything needed, I just dont know what is the best way to do this. Please help. (Oh, there is a full industrial kitchen on site. No broiler available) 




 A minister, a doctor, and a police officer walk into an oriental tea house. The minister turns to the doctor and says "Go Browns?" The police officer, with a mouthful of tea biscuits pipes up "Rectum? Hell, it damn near killed 'em"! *Edit wokka wokka* 




 I hate the Steelers. I REALLY dislike Bradshaw. This hurts my heart every time I see it. I wonder if Bradshaw would be less looney if this play hadnt happened? 




 Drunk Johnny Guy would be epic
 




 This much of the season is equal to the 40 game mark in baseball. It's when you start looking at the identity of a team. Also we are on the other side of our Bye. I thought maybe somebody had put something together. 




 I would love to be able to show the people here in WA what the new number is in the AFC. Go Browns 




 To quote an earlier thread, "You're just ants at a picnic" 




 *nods slowly while pointing with his pipe* Absolutely 




 Just heard the term "Brian Football" on twitter. 




 Hoyer did not get intetcepted, that play came back.  




 All of my upvotes are belonging to this 




 At least we know whoever made the video is classy.

 Ive been and was a paying member of the HOTlanta group. Good folks. I don't know if they meet in the same place. I know there is a huge group of them going to the game. I still get the emails. 




 I have Rogers. Hoyer and Rogers should be fine  




 The Destroyer is holding strong over his mentor this season in Fantasy. I have Hoyer AND Brady on my team. So I was trying to figure out if I should go with Hoyer as the beast he is, or Brady as the beast he is supposed to be but hasnt been at all this year? So I asked [The Guru] (http://imgur.com/VbOlabc). Das Guru doesnt even have Hoyer ranked (BS) and he has 6 fantasy points on average more than Brady on the year. And their suggestion is Brady over Hoyer. The lack of a ranking is mind blowing to me.

 When you open a new image there is a drop down box that says (pxl) next to the Height/Width. Click that and you can choose inch, centimeter, and all kinds of stuff. Super Easy. 




 As soon as I posted this I got help. You guys didnt even have to post anything. It just showed up Let's see those Photoshop guys do that. Thanks! 




 I am currently making a full page ad for a magazine, and the ad must come out to 9 3/8 in. X 7 1/8in. I cant for the life of me find a template or info on what the pixel size conversion is. My skill level is Intermediate/Intermediate. Thank you for any help. 




 Im sorry you have to go to such a horrible place as that. 




 This bye week, I am a Bucs Fan. Fuck the Steelers and fuck their stupid little towels that are about to infest your stadium. Buc their asses out of town! 




 "I'm not racist,  I own a colored TV!" 




 I think its a bad look for the Browns,  who historically fielded some of the first non white players in football history,  to be dropping racial slurs. It makes you look ignorant. Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt.  I want you to say the word "Jiggaboo" in front of Jim Brown,  and see if he wouldn't just cold cock you.  *edit: players* 




 You just called people jiggaboos....that is some racist hate speech,  sir.  




 [Boo.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BooThisMan.gif) 




 It was a nice gesture because he is a Raven, and if you dont get that, you dont get your history. 




 Seriously, if you are one of the many new Browns fans this year this will give you a lot of what you need to know to be on point. 




 My Grandfather has been a season ticket holder FOREVER.  Muni lot patrons know him as Big Den. We were tailgating before we beat Carolina at home a number of years ago, and he said to me with tears in his eyes:"If Lerner would just come down here and see this. If he could just see how much we support this team, maybe it would help them" This makes me happy for my grandpa like I can't even quantify.  




 Guess so. 




 *EDIT: Cleveland has good fans, thank you. We are not good to the Ravens. Sorry-Not-Sorry* 
We fucking hate the Ravens, we hate their fans, and we hate Art. And didnt give his punk ass a moment of silence when the rest of the league did after his stupid ass croaked. We revel in your legal battles, we love that you have the reputation for being thieves, murderers, drug addicts, and adulterers, and we like it when you have to play without your stars.  (Other teams play that game too, but you guys make it into an "Art" lulz) And it was a serious sign of respect that you should recognize, because in a different time, Pita would have been covered in broken bottles, and D Batteries to put the cherry on top of his injury. Know this, and accept our acknowledgement of showing you respect.  




 Knew this was coming. When you call it "The Cundiff Factor" its time to move on  




 Anyone else feel like they are developing angina? 




 #socrow 




 On another thread: http://i.imgur.com/rrljMZB.jpg you're welcome  




 For real. Good job. 









 Yeah, totally not worried. Just relaying some trivia. I didnt know 6 games is what a player had to play for it to count against their contract. I think he'll stay, too.  




 I know that when I shared that I thought that the Ravens and Art Modell sold their soul to the Devil for 2 Super Bowls and now they were paying the piper I got a lot of flak, [but](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=2370)  




 I found out from a friend today that 6 games is the minimum a player has to play for it to be considered a contract year. 




 Thank you. I just saw that the link broke. Just as well, it was from a Ratbird source. I always keep up on the team we are playing next week. If you want the real 411 on how your team is improving, and where your team scares other teams, read your opponents sources the week before the game. 









 Totally worked that way. Gratzi. 




 Done! You are wise. 




 WTF......? 




 I hope Hoyer saw this.  




 Eeeeeeeee.....I don't like any of them 




 Yeah.  I have Devin Hester on fantasy.  He was sitting at 29.20 when I went to bed.  




 Anyone know where I can get a copyable version of his response?

 Bless "you're" heart. 




 I recognize your statement as true, and reply with: "I know. I'm only talking about the one who might become the NFL Commish" 




 **T** 




 Any hater of the Steelers is a friend of mine, unless they're a ratbird. Sorry T-West. 




 Fuck the Steelers in their fucking face. I hope Cam wipes the floor with them and their stupid, stupid, terrible towel. From the Browns, Go Panthers! 




 Well, She IS part of a cabinet of politicians who have been accused of being war criminals. Whether you like that fact, or not, it's true.  









 That was a great great great post. I love being a Browns fan, right now, who has been a Browns fan forever.  




 *WOOOF WOOOF* 




 Accepted.
 




 Brady threw a 15.45 in my league this week, and Hoyer finished with a solid 20.00 




 I just think thats the classiest thing! "You know, we have a storied history with, and have always stood up for murderers and spousal abusers. In that spirit we would like to dedicate this game to Ray Rice" Even if you support Ray, THAT is not the way to do it. THAT is tactless, imo. 









 We shouldnt have to increase the minimum wage, because it should have gone up in concert with CEO pay all along. Then it wouldn't seem like a financial burden when we have to move the common worker out of poverty wages and into livable wages. 




 Someone was going to. He's good.
 




 So on the field we are nameless,  but in the media,  we have a name. His name was Ifeanyi Momah. His name was Ifeanyi Momah. His name was Ifeanyi Momah.. 




 What's his name? *EDIT, His name is Ifeanyi Momah* 









 Thank you for the correction  




 Okay, [I did.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/01/10/ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-atlanta-murder-2000/1566198/) He wasn't acquitted of anything he was found guilty of a lesser charge on a plea bargain *edit added*

It says: *Only Lewis pleaded guilty in relation to the case: for obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor. He originally was charged with two counts of murder but struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony against two of his companions that night, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting.* 




 Ray Lewis killed that fool in Atlanta. He was never found innocent. The charges were dropped in exchange for testimony. 




 [SMH.](http://imgur.com/gallery/IQSK4Qy) Some folks forget about Neverland and then break bad on those who have fun. James Hook. No imagination. Bless your hearts. 




 I [told the Ravens sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu) when their people started getting in trouble (specifically this was about Lorenzo Taliaferro) that it was Karma. I even wrote a story, and was downvoted and told I was a stupid Browns Fan, and then I was accused of "Running to my sub for upvotes" (which I was too new to know that was a thing). I am reposting my story here, again, in light of Ray Rice, and the Raven fan-base can Dawg my Bone if they dont like it. The truth stings:

**My Story of The Ravens, Art Model, and the Devil**:*The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day. It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.* *edit:formatting*

 End of his career, but it was the beginning of his HoF push, which he will probably NEVER see now.  




 In the Browns fan-fic I have going on my head,  Haslam unveiled them with the Elf Ear cuts during a team meeting from under a white blanket. A loud "TA DAAA!" and everyone "ooooooooo"ed. *Slow close up on Brownie smiling  mischievously* Then we cut to the boys in the tunnel with the side view of the helmet. 




 Because I think that shit is nice, and I like it.
