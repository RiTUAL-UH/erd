 Really? Where did they announce this? 




 It's probably still gunna be a console. 




 yeah, couldn't agree more. 




 Personally, I don't expect to hear anything. Still, interested in what you guys think. 





























 why is it stupid? 




 It's not as fun, I agree. But you know, it's probably more fun than losing. 














 Surprised that so many people say diplomacy here, even though it did not turn out to be so in the poll. 




 I almost never rely on hotels and airports for culture wins. It's all about the digs   great works. And plus, if you found a religion and go for the reform where all religious buildings get 2 tourism, that makes culture really simple. 




 Made me laugh as well, when someone suggested I should include I usually lose as an option. 




 Same with me. But I guess science being first isn't a big surprise either. 




 Fair enough, seems like that's where most people are as well. 




 Give it some time man, data take time to accumulate. I doubt it will be 25% when there are more answers.

Personally, I am not a fan of Steam. But still curious to see what others say. 





























 honestly, anytime you have salt and no dessert, it's usually a good start. 



















 It's true that sometimes clients wants you to explain your methodology, but a lot of times I find that clients would go with "better" result even if the model is somewhat incorrectly applied. By better results, I mean more accurate predictions, easier for them to understand, or results that make more sense/more correct intuitively. 









 very true. 









 When you deal with time series data, for example. 




 let's stay away from the bayesian debate. 









 I think everyone knows this sentence is from Box. 




 I know, but I always feel that you should prepare your own data, at least the key part of it. It's like preparing your own food as a chef 




 Other than 6, which I am unsure of, all others I totally agree. 




 Someone was sharing on LinkedIn and I thought it's interesting for data scientists.

1. Data is never clean
2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data.
3. 95% of the tasks do not require deep learning.
4. 90% of cases GLM will do the trick.
5. Big Data is just a tool.
6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach.
7. No one cares how you did it.
8. Academia and business are two different worlds.
9. Presentation is key - be a master of PowerPoint.
10. All models are wrong, but some are useful.
11. There is no full automated data science. You need to get your hands dirty. 














 It looked like a very sketchy concept. Wouldn't be surprised to hear it violates the law. 









 Adding onto what Pesto_Enthusiast said,

sometimes a case could be investigated by both the police   the university (e.g. campus police). The university investigation only determines if you get to stay in the school. It does not replace police investigation, nor does it imply the police won't look it anymore. 









 this would vary a lot, depending on what your business does. I don't think anyone can give you a precise answer without knowing what you do exactly (you are basically asking for something that management consultants would do for big companies). 




 this is nice! 




 Yeah, guardians are pretty good as well.

Also agree that warriors are my least favourite. 




  Elementalist would be my choice. What do you guys say? 





























 overall 









 that's probably the smartest thing to do. 









 This is like lottery eh? The first one you buy you win something, and then after that you never get anything. 




 Agree. Your time could be used elsewhere. 














 OMG, what do you do for a living? Are you a professional player? 




 This one gives you much more information though, like geographical breakdown, etc etc, but strawpoll is simpler. 




 I just added a nothing option. 




 personally, I don't spend too much money on cases, only $100 something. I wonder how much an average player would spend on something that is purely aesthetic.
