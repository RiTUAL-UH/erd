 Nice! 




 I want to do this. 




 I am continually stunned with these folks. 




 Or the anthrax attack. 




 I'd probably buy one of those around-the-world cruises. 




 And still he gets no respect (except from us libs who love him) 




 I was thinking about that yesterday. I would try them! 




 Life is stranger than fiction. 




 There is a rv rental business on Sahara between i15 and the strip where you can rent tent trailers reasonably also, although I have'nt checked them out in a few years. 




 Isn't that a little elitist? 




 I was thinking about this yesterday.  It would definitely get me excited.  Not sure if she could win though.... 









 I think a survey was done one and the Turkish leader Ataturk was ranked highest of all leaders. Sorry, I don't have the time to find it now. 









 I always wonder if he is playing checkers or chess.  I still don't know, but it could screw us if the Republicans finally played ball.  Also, I wish he would use the stage to change the conversation.  No talk about jobs, only the lousy deficit.  No help for Main Street, only more help for Wall Street. 




 Why would you start a war if nobody came? 




 He doesn't seem to learn. 




 I love it. 














 Sick. 




 



The Urban League has a job program for ex-felons.  They also have a list of employers who will hire them.   There are a group of hotels also, but you have to be honest with them upfront.  Jobs are tough for everyone here now though.





 




 Wait until they are all monopolies, and no one has money or capital to compete. 




 That's because you have never listened to her.  She KNOWS what she is talking about.  She is not a wingbat. 




 Wow.   I like the sound of that! 




 Yeah, but military spending doubled after 9-11.  It needs to be cut even more.  We don't need 80+ bases around the world.  We don't need to outspend the rest of the world combined. 




 Apathy. 




 Taxes on the rich were 90% in the fifties, and corporations paid most of the taxes. 









 It happened to me too.  I'm trying to get in the spirit again, but I'm just so tired.  Hopefully, I'll come around soon, and not let it happen again. 




 Now, if they all would vote. 




 I feel like I had this my whole life, but don't consider myself gifted.  As an existentialist, however, I just realized that in the end it doesn't matter anyway. 




 The other person fired during the war was Bill Maher. 



















 Good for you for asking.  I felt like I couldn't look at another salad or another chicken.   I fell off the wagon and gained my weight back, stopped working out, and feel miserable. 




 He is absolutely correct.  The amount of Social Security one receives is also based on your top 30 yrs of earnings - and you need to earn $20,000/year substanial earnings for the year to count more than $0.  I see too many jobs paying minimum wage to $12/hr which will never help to contribute enough earnings for social security.  And comments here are right too, we can never get enough people out to protest.  We have to find a way to get the do-nothings out of congress and keep the good ones. I'm so frustrated too for people - yet alone myself. 




 Sorry about the spelling. 




 And through the constitution, they are structurally given what they need to survive. 









 We have a spending problem. 









 Or too lazy to look up and post.  Thanks from a lazy one. 




 I see people take out of their 401(k)s all the time.  And even when they don't, they can't save enough to carry them through their retirement.  Do you want them to die on the streets? 




 And a good place to harvest profits. 




 I agree.  I also know a Sandy Duncan.  LOL. 




 No, I'm sorry about your mom (my dad died at 48), but that's also how it supports people that live longer too.  I don't believe social security is broken.  It's the best thing we have going.  I'm looking forward to it, and you will be grateful it will be there for you.  It's just that Wall Street wants very badly to get their hands on it. 




 I looked for his website, but it looks like it doesn't exist anymore.  He had a packet of handouts you could buy also for about $15.  I had planned to order it, but never got around to it.  Our universities have been hit so hard that anything out of the ordinary in no longer there.  Sorry!  He did spend a lot of time talking about Mexico, where Americans could go, health care, taxes, etc.  He did cover other areas that are popular with potential expats.  I still think there is a market, but don't know where he went! 




 At least not soon enough for me.  I'm so tired of the tyranny of the minority we know as the right-wing. 














 Good luck.  I'm pulling for you too.  Just wish I had something offer. 




 It's an 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, and the road is long and boring.  There used to be a billboard on the highway in the fifties that just said "Ain't this monotomous?"  I remember it as a child, and only wish I had a photo of it today.  Your comment reminded me of it. 









 You did good work, and while they were not in my City, I was aware of and supported your efforts - for 30+ yrs.  I also hated that Dems were such wimps. 














 I thought the sequestration would fail due to the lobbyists, so I don't know.  It is interesting though. 




 People invested in stocks until the bubble burst and they lost their investment.  So that is when they started investing heavily in the real estate market (at least there was something real sitting there), and then the housing bubble burst and people lost the value of that also.  SS is the only option that isn't a ripoff.  It's an insurance plan that you pay for 50 years of your labor. 




 I know some people who have used granite tiles - much less expensive - and can be a diy project.   




 I've seen it.  People who think they are deserving, but no one else is. 




 I attended a one-night class through the continuing education program of our university.  I think it cost $59.   The guy who gave it travels through the west coast doing it at different universities.  So, yes, it is possible. 




 That's a better comment than mine. 




 Bradley Manning was trying to OPEN up government and start a conversation.  The Tea Party is trying to CLOSE down the big bad government. 




 I'm not sure if it was the Pew study, but there was a study of who was the Tea Party, and it was discovered that it was the religious right. 




 Good point.  They also met on the day of Obama's first inauguration and decided to fight him on everything.  And they have!  Even their own recommendations for appointments have been fillabustered! 




 I see jobs frequently on usajobs.com for positions for the military. 




 I don't understand the Republican's push for these drug testing bills.  They did it in Florida and less than 3% of the population showed any drugs, less use than the general public.  Somebody has got to be getting big contracts - why else?  It's a huge waste of money.  Somebody, enlighten me. 




 That happens to all of us - it's not just because of our views. 




 You might want to go to PBS and watch the PBS Frontline on 401(k)s.  Nebraska did a 20 yr study and decided that people could never retire on them. 




 I can't believe that I found it.  I knew him through his manager who was named Red (It's been too many years now!)  Saw him box at the Showboat.  I remember the infamous Howard Cossell talking on tv on what a strong boxer he was.  He didn't have the move Ali had, but he could hit.

 Yeah, but they will blame it on Obama. 




 I hope to visit someday. 




 I really like Ellison. 




 Republicans don't care about budgets.  They just want to dismantle the social safety net. 




 I thought the bristle cone pine in California was the oldest tree.

 He is a part of everything bad that has happened to us in the past 20 years.  His wife was on the Enron Board.  He was the main proponent of ending Glass-Steigel.  The sequester too???? 














 Actually, S.T.Gregg was a Las Vegas boxing champion in the late 70's.  He won the cruiser weight championship. 




 Beale cypher has never been broken, I believe. 









 My friend who has designed over 100 beautiful houses hasn't had a job since the economy crashed. 




 I'd buy from you! 




 Reagan was voted very low in one of these surveys shortly after his administration ended.  Big money came to the rescue to change history. 




 I believe the House just got pay raises too.  Sleazy people. 




 I've read this before.  What I want to know is if there is a hereditary or a DNA basis.  I wonder if it could be based on ancestry. 




 He earned it. 




 They are already on the dole. 




 Right.  Government is subsidizing low wages with foods stamps, medical and TANF, not to mention housing, utility allowance, etc. 









  Congress allows it.  




 Lol. Busted. 




 You are right.   There was a study somewhere that confirmed this.  I wish I had the link to place here. 




 They are actually the religious right, but I think most republicans believe  the same things.  The only ones that don't are the 1% who only believe in the bottom line who have been funding the republicans all along. 




 Thom Hartmann says it the "two Santa Claus theory" and says it was planned that way. 




   He is my favorite person alive.  I'll probably be at work however and will probably miss it. 




 I put $3000 in a 401K in 1990.  It is still worth $3000 today.  For those of you who who don't believe the article, I urge to to check out the Frontline video on PBS.  Nebraska conducted a 20 yr study and came out with the same conclusion.  People will not be able to retire on a 401(k). And Social Security is not a ponzi scheme because we should not run out of workers investing the system.  A ponzi scheme runs out of investors.  I do worry about there being a lack of work permanently as a way to distribute money throughout the society.  If we do not have work, we will all lose and the whole economy will fail, not just social security.  I've spent a lot of years looking at this. 




 I thought they were trying to get rid of "stupid". 




 Work has been a way to distribute money or wealth.  With computerization, there will be less jobs in the future.  We have to find another way to distribute money so people can live.  Not everyone can be an entrepreneur either. 




 I do worry about the "substantial earnings" amount.  It is about $20,000 per year now, and there are too many low-wage earners that are employed 20-30 hrs/week.   




 Privatized, then stolen by Wall Street. 




 Center-left yes. 




 Interesting. 




 Not really.  Nobody pays me to read and respond to reddit articles. 




 You have my vote. 




 We have heard of people being paid to be bloggers on the right.  I see some of the reddit comments and wonder "hmmm, I wonder if this person is paid to say that".  Am I the only person that wonders about this? 




 My husband's uncle told him that it would never be there for him. Well,  my husband worked for 50 years, and guess what, he is receiving it. 




 In a ponzi scheme, you run out of investors.  Social Security has a ready stream of investors (workers paying in to the sytem) and people who either receiving or dead. 




 Wall Street wants thier hands on all that money. 




 I'm impressed about your investments. 




 
i got one today! 




 reddit. 




 If they really stopped the vote changing by the republicans during the last election, I love them.  Wish it could be verified however. 




 Interesting.  I don't remember cuts to medicaid, food stamps, but I remember him cutting lots of people from SSI.  And it didn't seem like there was much said about it.  It was just done.  I would be interested in reading about that.  Also, it was overnight that people started appearing pushing grocery carts around.   I had never seen it before. 




 You could do it with foundation support. 




 I think it is remarkable, and a way of organizing workers which seems almost impossible these days.  I think it will probably be out of business once Obamacare is implemented however.  Will have to see. 




 Typing. 




 
I would like to spend one summer there. 




 AFSCME, the Public employee union. 









 A  lot less jobs due to robots. 




 Sunday night: Inaugural Party

 I think it's good.  Maybe he can bring sense to these folks. 




 I've only dreamed about it... 




 I'm a 63 yr old female and never had children by choice.  I've also been married for 40 yrs.  I like quiet time, and I'm amazed at people that do have children and manage to accomplish so much in thier lives.  In many ways, I've done very little other than work.  I only regret not having children when I think about my husband and how he might have liked it and if it would have changed his life.  He accepted it however, and now says the world has enough children.  I also have a male high school friend who never had children and regrets it very much.  He would still like to have children. 




 I like it. 




 Yes, but that was after years of screaming about the debt.  Remember the debt clock in NYC?  It stopped moving. 




 I didn't read the article, but the headline is ridiculous.  Republicans screamed like crazy during the Clinton years also.  Just not during the Bushes or Reagan years when the debt was building.  Thom Hartmann believes it is a strategy called the "Two Santa Theory".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski 




 This guy is sick. 




 Possibly Clark County Social Services. 









 I'm sorry I didn't go to summer school and graduate early, and I'm sorry I didn't apply myself more in college.  I thought it was just like high school l- floated through it.   




 There was an article on reddit recently where mothers in the Appalachia were women were keeping their children from learning to read so that they could claim they were disabled and eligible for social security disability.  If true, these stories break my heart. 




 Age of Aquarius? 




 He is quickly becoming one of my favorite congress member!  Republicans are not necessarily in favor of cutting the deficit.  They just don't like social programs that might help someone else.  They will always support private industry or military contractors. 




 
yikes. 




 I can't wait! 




 Let's only hope.  Remember, they still have the governorship and control of 30 state legislatures.  This has to end too. 




 Thanks for posting the link,  Sometimes we forget how good we have it! 




 Why are they wrong on EVERY issue? 




 I actually think in the end that the ACC is a support to business, like SNAP or Food Stamps helps farmers as much as people.
