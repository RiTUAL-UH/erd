 Cersei Lannister. Woman was forced to marry someone, he treated her like a garbage can despite her hair, had a sociopath son, a dad who only cared about his legacy, had her daughter shipped off to Dorne, and a drinking problem. And the only guy who really loves her is her brother. Gross. Then when she tries to protect her kids or get revenge for some things, she's branded as evil. Don't get me wrong the things she has done this season have been uncalled for though. But before she was shit on for no reason. 




 How's your butt doing? 




 Many thanks. Will not be showing her this. 




 OOOOOOHHHHH 




 BASE jumping! 




 But it's warmer. Doesn't that mean it absorbs more energy? Bear with me I'm really bad at science stuff. 




 Okay but if it doesn't change temperature as much as air then why does it absorb more energy sometimes (winter) and less energy other times (summer)?
