 A reimagining of the Star Wars prequel trilogy edited into a single compelling movie, based on the structure conceived by actor Topher Grace. As a critique of episodes 1-3, many large plot pieces have been removed or changed to strengthen the core relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Padm Amidala. More than 100 video and audio edits heighten the main character's tragic fall from grace.

2. enable zrminimap only and reload ui again
3. an error will pop up.. ignore it and hit escape and go to settings, you should see a zrminimap area click it and change the alpha to go UP where you can see it
4. you can now reload all the other addons and the error should be gone
5. ENJOY
