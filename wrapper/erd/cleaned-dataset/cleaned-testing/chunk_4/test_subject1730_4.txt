 What. The. Actual. Fuck. 




 It just always makes me happy when the Commander in Chief gives the commencement address at the USCGA 




 Hmmm.... I'm not sure then :/ 

I tried it once and like I said, I never put the pad all the way in.  




 Fantastic colorization! 









 It's amazing how quickly our bodies build up a tolerance to alcohol. 




 That is damned impressive! 




 I remember my "friends" didn't want to be around me as I worked on getting sober. Mostly because my "Friends" all hung out at the bar. SO, I feel that I'm better off without them.

 That's fantastic! Some people are able to keep it under control. Sadly for me, when I could down 18 longnecks in a night and not feel a buzz of any kind, I knew I might have a problem. 




 Good for you.  




 That's a hell of a wake up. I'm sorry that you had to go through that. 




 That's my reasoning as well. I can give up alcohol, but I don't want to loose my daughter. 




 I've been sober from alcohol for 3 years now. I got sober because I was facing the prospect of loosing all contact with my child. 




 This can be to alcohol, drugs, anything that you were once addicted to. 




 The one issue I had was that you're supposed to insert the pad completely in. I've always had an issue with that and never got it all the way in. In theory, what's supposed to happen is any liquid, the pad absorbs and expands, blocking you up completely. At some point your bod will force it out but I've never been comfortable with inserting it all the way. It's supposed to be one hell of a mind-fuck though as your body feels the need to expel, the pad blocks it and absorbs some. 




 Indeed! And I was stationed on that ship for 3 years :) 




 I still have yet to answer it O_o 




 Phew! It's all good :D 









 I was under the impression that the stem was the seam where the bow met.

 This was taken during the drydock period of 2004 in Oakland, CA. 









 That's good to know! Our Fire Control guys gave me that reason, so like all good things, I took their word as true with no fact checking on my part 




 I've only seen it successfully fired once and it was pretty damn a awesome. The loudest I've ever heard was the MK-75 76mm canon that was on the bow. Either that or the MK38 Mod 2 




 I would love to see more! 




 Lol. It's quite alright! 




 I do find it fitting that I would post a pic of said CIWS after making that comment.
