 Nicely done. 




 Freedom allows for anything. When you have complete freedom in an unregulated market, how does that affect capitalism? 




 You are equating freedom to capitalism. So what happens when there is no government and it's complete freedom with pure unregulated capitalism? 




 The best book I was ever assigned in college. I also got to see Zinn speak at my college a few years back. He told a heartbreaking story about when he was bomber pilot at the end of WWII. 




 They are both grammatically correct but they don't mean the same thing. *Perfectly* is an adverb. It modifies verbs. *Perfect* is an adjective. It modifies nouns.

"Made it perfectly" means that you made no mistakes in the process of making. It also *implies* that "it" is well-made.

"Made it perfect" means that you made "it" into something perfect, but doesn't really describe how you made it. 




 We haven't found anything sweet in the natural world that can kill us. Part of the theory is that sensitivity to sweetness helps us identify safe foods. 




 The browser has already started downloading the file when it displays the "save as" dialog. It's continuing to download it in the background to your temporary folder while it's waiting for you to respond. You're not actually gaining any speed. It's smoke and mirrors but it's a useful tactic nonetheless. 




 In the old days, arcane programming languages (Fortran, C) didn't have compilers that were intelligent enough to infer a procedure's memory allocation requirements just from the code. When you jump into a procedure, the computer has to build a stack frame, allocating just enough memory from the stack to contain all of your variables, pointers and handles. Declaring all of your variables at the start of your procedure is telling the compiler how big your stack frame needed to be.

These days a lot of languages are *interpreted*--they aren't even compiled (Python, Javascript). For the rest, the compilers are now pretty smart about it but the language syntax of Java derives from C/C++ and it's a holdover. 




 Actually, the Christian Science Monitor's news reporting is quite unbiased and Pulitzer Prize-winning. They go out of their way to not get caught up in mass hysteria, and to maintain high standards of decorum. They are well respected in journalism. 




 I think there are a couple of explanations. First, the true believers have to die off so it takes at least a generation for non-revolutionary social change. In the meantime the young became more and more disillusioned as they saw that what they were taught in school did not match the reality on the street. They saw that the struggle remained and that the bourgeoisie was merely replaced by oligarchs. Second, in the latter half of the 20th century, after a series of tragic political wars (Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Cold War), people were pushing back against centralized governance and federalism all around the world, including both the USSR and the United States. Instead of the view that the government will take care of you, the prevailing view now is that you have to take care of yourself. That, of course, plays right into capitalism. 




 Marxist socialism requires centralized control and planning and relies on buy-in of all participants so it just isn't manageable on a large scale. When it encounters problems, it will become unstable very quickly and collapse. Capitalism, though it has its own problems, is more tolerant of mistakes, errors and human imperfections and is thus more stable. 

As we have seen, no social system exists at a perfect state, at least not for very long. It must have some kind of self-correction built in or else it will collapse. 




 The stuff inside our cells also push out at exactly the same pressure so all of our cells are at equilibrium with the air. 




 4 major things that affect the quality of a digital camera:

1. Resolution and quality of the sensor. Those are the megapixels. More megapixels is potentially more detail, but other factors come into play. Read on.
2. Post-processing. The camera makes image adjustments (contrast, brightness, white balance) then compresses it to make the file size smaller. There are big variations here because some cameras have faster processors and thus can do more. Also, the higher the compression, the smaller the file size but also the less detail the image will have.
3. Lens quality. More expensive cameras have more glass elements in the lens and higher quality glass and coatings. This helps the image come into sharper focus from the center all the way to the edge. Lower quality cameras are visibly fuzzy around the edges of the image.
4. Lens size. Larger lenses allow more light in and render lens imperfections and dirt/smudges less obvious. They also give you shallower depth of field for more creativity. 




 I can certainly understand political compromise to be able to pass anti-abortion laws. Part of my question seeks to better understand the personal beliefs of pro-lifers because it really seems like the majority are personally OK with abortion in those circumstances. Do you agree? 




 I'm with you. 




 When was the last time you or anyone you know went into Radio Shack? Why should that company stay in business in a market economy? 




 I looked at the Gallup numbers and even Googled to get them going back farther than what the opinion article showed. The Gallup statistical trends fairly well match the BLS trend, with the peak unemployment in 2009 and a steady employment growth since then. The only real difference is that Gallup includes both seekers and non-seekers in the unemployed statistic. It's certainly valuable to know both but it doesn't really matter whether you lump the two together. 

So I guess the question is what to do about people who have given up looking for work? I guess you have to ask why that happens? 

Let's say I was an NFL player but I was released by my team. I have worked out with several other teams but none of them so far have decided to offer a contract. I've decided to hang up the cleats. Can you still call me an NFL player?

So the question is what you call somebody who isn't looking for work? Sure, they're unemployed. Maybe the better thing is to call the BLS statistic "active seekers" but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it. 




 What I meant is that the pro-life side wants to enact laws banning abortions but many of those laws include exceptions to allow an abortion for rape or incest. 




 This is not meant to be a debate or be inflammatory. I just don't understand how somebody justifies the rape   incest exception. Is it merely political expedience? 




 It's far from certain that more money equates to more votes. In some examples it does appear to be a factor but there are also times when it works against a candidate.

Candidates can't afford to turn down money, and that's really where the problem lies. Money doesn't necessarily buy a candidate a win but it does buy the candidate. 




 Less reflection. Water absorbs more light. Our brain interprets the amount of light hitting our eyes as brightness/lightness. Less reflected light will make the surface appear darker. 




 Thanks, that graph is helpful indeed. 




 Thanks, that's a helpful article. If wage growth is around 2% but inflation is currently 1-1.5%, isn't it fairly inline?

Still, productivity is still increasing so that additional GDP is going somewhere. Perhaps that explains the increasing wealth gap. What to do about that? 









 For me, these four conditions:

1. When you earn enough to house, clothe and feed yourself so as to not be a burden on anyone else.
2. Your kids, if you have any, are well adjusted and generally happy
3. You enjoy being around your friends and your friends genuinely like you
4. You have enough free time and resources to do some things you really enjoy that don't make you any money 




 I've heard this claim over the past couple of years but can you supply a source to back it up? 




 What's an Ah? 




 I don't disagree that it's mostly vanity. Still, Mercedes can't just rebadge a C class and charge 3X unless they install an aromatherapy system. 




 OK, fine. :)

The Mercedes S class has a 200 meter radar and two cameras for 3D optical sensing, biturbo V12 or V8 with a 10.0 compression ratio, computer controlled variable suspension dampening with camera-controlled adjustment, two 12.3" LCD displays in the drivers dash with road-ahead night time video display, one display is touch sensitive. Navigation, communication and system controls on the steering wheel, a Burmester 24 speaker sound system, car systems that are controllable from your smartphone, massaging seats, aromatherapy climate control, adaptive cruise control (stop   go self driving), lane departure warning, blind spot detection....

It's pretty amazing that it's reliable as it is. It's also why it's probably not a good idea to buy older used S-Classes, 7-Series or A8s. 




 Not according to the Social Security Administration.
http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html

The latest year they have stats is 2013 but there's no reason to think 2014 went negative.

The last time wages decreased was 2009, at the height of the recession. With unemployment dropping to 5.6%, I can't see that wages will be decreasing from 2013 to 2014.

Can you cite any study for your claim? 




 It's water vaporizing and creating bubbles that pop. 




 Land Rover (Defender 90) owner here. Can confirm. It's the equivalent of a supermodel girlfriend. Looks good but man, high maintenance. 




 In the U.S. the German auto manufacturers only import their most expensive lines which give them the most profit margin. These models have a lot more features than a basic car and are engineered for higher performance and capability, e.g. all wheel drive, independent wishbone suspension on all 4 wheels, higher compression, variable valve timing, and so on and so on. 

TL;DR: More stuff means more stuff that breaks. 




 If you didn't manage to sell before you get foreclosed, I believe the bank will take receivership of the house. They will sell at whatever price they want and they have no incentive to sell at FMV. They only want to recover their loan and foreclosure expenses. 









 It's not a debate. I'm seeking understanding on how someone on the pro-life side reconciles what appears to be a contradiction. 




 It's what pro-lifers have said.

From the National Right To Life website:
*"For more than 100 years, medical science has known conclusively that every individual's life begins at the moment of fertilization."* 




 The chance of birth defects is higher but probably still pretty rare in countries with good health care. 

The second argument is the same argument that pro-choicers use, that it's not good to force a woman to keep an unwanted child.

The third is the sticking point. It *does* seem that there are circumstances in which the mother's feelings outweigh the life in the womb. It would appear that pro-lifers and pro-choicers have a lot of similarities. 




 So it's not about the life of the baby? 














 Changes in the market combined with bad management decisions. One usually leads to the other.

Sometimes it's just dumb shitty luck. Pan Am is an example of a one-time undisputed worldwide leader that no longer exists because of a lot of forces outside of their control. 




 A client of mine wants to run a second instance of Windows 7 inside a VM under Windows 7. He has his reasons. 

I'm comparing VMWare Player vs. VirtualBox. Player seems to be a little quicker here and there. Anybody have strong thoughts on this? Is there another VM I should be looking at?

Client has an Ivy Bridge i7 with 12G RAM. 




 It's a bit of a pain. You usually have to boot into a separate CD or pen drive because it's hard to make a clone of a hard drive that is currently in use.

You can use [Easeus Disk Copy](http://www.easeus.com/disk-copy/home-edition/). It's a bootable CD. 




 That would be the most basic of basic backups. But it's effective. 

Yes, you should be able to copy/paste to a Windows backup drive. Create a folder for your files first. Don't touch or delete any of the files  or folders that Windows has already created. 




 As Teekno said, a MLM company has product(s). Sales of the product infuses revenue into the company to be distributed among the levels. That being said, nobody buys into a MLM company to sell vitamins or fruit juice.

Pyramid schemes don't have products and revenue. They are often investment schemes around capital assets such as real estate. They promise a high return to attract investors. In order to keep attracting investors they must show that they paid those promised rates of return. The managers often take new investment money to pay the returns, in order to attract more investment. And so on and so forth until there are few new investors putting in and lots of old investors looking for payment. 




 A sonic boom is all of the sound that a jet engine makes compressed into a single wave. So I suppose if you passed the speed of light and there was actually light shining on you that you're reflecting, a bystander would see a bright flash of light.

But I could be wrong... With all those photons compressed together you might go Supernova. 




 See my answer. You're doing backup type #4 - system backup with Microsoft Windows proprietary backup format. 




 In the print options screen you can usually select grayscale, which will send print job containing no color information. Your printer should then only use the black ink. 




 There are different kinds of backups. From simplest to most complex:

1. Basic file backup - this just makes a single copy of your files. If your computer crashes you have to reinstall your operating system and programs but you can get a copy of your documents from the last time of backup. The benefit of this kind of backup is that the files on your external hard drive are exactly the same kind of file that you see on your computer's hard drive. You don't need your backup software to be able to restore a file. You can just drag/drop of copy/paste.

2. Basic file backup with timestamped versions - Like #1 except it keeps multiple changes of your documents. This is good for people who need to be able to restore a version of a document from a week or month ago, such as writers.

3. Mirror Backup (also called a clone) - This makes an exact duplicate of your hard drive. This can be used to completely restore your computer in the event of a drive failure but it's slow because your entire drive is copied during each backup. The backup's files are also plainly readable like with the basic backup.

4. System Backup - You can use this to restore the exact state of your computer just like the mirror backup. You can also have different versions so you can go back in history to selectively restore only a few files. The downside is that this is proprietary across different software so you need to have the software company's restore disc to recover from a failed drive. The files are also in a proprietary format so aren't plainly readable if you just wanted to quickly browse your backup and view some files. 




 Human evolution is over. Or it has slowed to such a crawl that it might as well be over. First, our ability to manipulate our environment, to cure disease, to modify our foods means that we don't have to wait generations. A gun means I don't have to outrun the mountain lion or bear any more. My coat lets me live above the arctic circle year round. My vitamins and my Kroger frequent shopper card lets me make delicious tropical fruit salads in the middle of winter.

Second, birth control has turned the mechanism by which evolution works--natural selection--on its head. In social after every social study, the individuals who are most well adapted to modern living are the ones having the fewest children. The well off are having few babies, if any at all, while the poor are breeding like rabbits. 




 The media absolutely must call out Rand Paul on his "many cases." Nobody should be allowed to make claims like that without being forced to give up proof. 




 Do you mean the other way around? Malware disguised as a media file?

It's possible but would probably rely on exploiting a bug in a media player. Not impossible, but unlikely. 




 Hmmm, I'm impressed they made the effort to be realistic. 




 ISIS is a guerilla group and are mixing in with the population. The west is not yet willing to accept the civilian casualties that would result from "steamrolling." 




 The screen is made up of two layers:  The glass on top and the digitizer below it. Your glass is broken but the digitizer, the part that detects your finger touches, is still intact and operational. 




 I was well into adulthood when I found out awry was pronounced "ah-rye."

BTW, I think "ruut" ("rt") is perfectly acceptable though incorrect. Ask him how he says "roto-rooter" then having him sing the jingle. 




 Because reddit is more interesting. 




 "She's not my type." Sometimes you just gotta lie. 




 When I toured The Great Pyramids this was the general explanation from our guide who was an Egyptian Egyptologist. 




 Did they make any sound? Fail then. 




 Men are carriers and her husband could have contracted the virus from a previous partner (or a secondary partner during their relationship). 




 To people who are downvoting:  Einstein's theory of general relativity. 




 Man-made fibers harbor the naturally occurring bacteria from your skin that produce body odors. That particular bacteria doesn't like cotton or wool as much.

 Okay, Einstein. :) 




 Pedophilia isn't illegal and those suffering from it should seek treatment. It's the manifestation into acts that harm others that is illegal. 




 Ah, I misinterpreted. I think that a lot of leeway is given to the police officer by the review board. Where I live we have a community review board and it still lets a lot go. The judgment is not whether the officer made the *best* decision, but whether the officer made a *justifiable* decision. 




 I am really not a defender of cops. I just wanted to bring up the fact that we all suffer from cognitive biases. I actually think that the profession attracts a certain kind type of bullying personality. I certainly agree that police should and must be prosecuted and punished when there is evidence that the activity was illegal and premeditated. I think police departments should fire these kinds of cops when they find disturbing patterns of behavior, before it becomes a PR nightmare.

Police also just screw up. I'm glad I don't have a reporter calling me every time I write a bad bug into my code. This is something we also should be aware of. Then there's all the hazy area. Police are asked to make very tough decisions that could be life/death and make them very quickly. When I see one of those, I'm just thankful I don't have to be the one evaluating it. 




 This is part of the reason why I have yet to be convinced that self-driving cars will actually take off. For liability purposes, someone must be responsible for the actions and decisions of the car, and that person is the driver. This is how the FAA treats Boeing 777s and Airbus A380s that can fly themselves completely from takeoff to landing. The Pilot in Command is ultimately responsible.

As the driver in command of a self-driving car, you assume responsibility. I can see that it would become a more stressful driving experience around town rather than a less stressful one. Perhaps on a controlled-access interstate it might be relaxing, but I can't see it being relaxing in a city, even if the car was a much better driver than me. I would still need to pay attention and be ready to assume control. 




 Broken taillight. A very popular reason to pull somebody over, especially around the nightlife district. It'll happen until they also invent self-repairing cars. 




 Some tissues either repair very slowly or don't repair at all. Cartilage, for example, doesn't have blood vessels thus don't get the level of nutrients needed to reproduce quickly and repair. 




 When the only thing you hear are stories of people goofing up, you're going to think that it happens a lot more than it actually does. It's a proven cognitive bias and it's something that you should be aware of because you (yes, even you) are susceptible to it. In order to make rational evaluations of the community in which you live, you should be aware of the ways perception can let you down. I encourage you to listen to a few of David McRaney's podcasts of "[You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast)." 

Hopefully this will lead you to explore the topic in greater depth, looking at actual data sets. 




 So your wipers don't get frozen to your windshield. It lets you scrape the ice off your whole windshield. By the way, flex your wiper blades along the entire length before you put them back down. This breaks the ice that tends to build up at the grip points where the rubber meets the steel. That ice buildup prevents the blade from conforming to the windshield curve which causes the streaking as the blade goes across the windshield. 




 The medical industry uses the term disease differently than your understanding. The DSM-IV calls addiction and dependence a brain disease. In medicine, brain diseases can be from a pathogen or could come from other causes such as trauma, tumors or hydrocephalus.

The reason why it's a brain disease is because the brain of a drug-dependent person behaves differently than someone else who is a non-user or a recreational user. Their brain produces less of a high in response to the drug (tolerance), and produces withdrawal symptoms when they get off the drug.

Lastly, I caution you about your viewpoint. Even those who have overcome their addictions through willpower understand how difficult it is and how easy it is for them to relapse. For many, it takes a lot more than willpower. It takes emotional support from their friends, family and community. Even with that, success is low. 




 It's a cognitive bias called The Availability Cascade. You don't hear about the times that a cop stopped a crime or a criminal because that's expected. /r/news articles that are unusual get upvoted but that tends to make those kinds of stories appear to be more prevalent than they actually are. That in turn promotes and encourages more of those kinds of stories to be posted. 




 The air doesn't decrease in temperature gradually as you go up in altitude. If stable enough it tends to form layers with boundaries. The same goes for ocean temperatures as you go down. The air mixes within the layers much more than it mixes across the boundary. Moist air condenses at the boundary, creating a flat bottomed cloud. 




 Israel *is* Palestine *is* Israel. History did not start 70 years ago. Until the creation of Israel, everyone in the area was called Palestinian, regardless of whether they were Muslim (80% of the population), Jews (15%) or Christians (5%).

Now, put yourself in the shoes of an Islamic Palestinian. You and generations of your family have lived in some house in a city like Jaffa for two thousand years or more. You've been ruled by Ottomans, then the British Mandate but you've always been Palestine. Then this guy comes along and suddenly says you're a new country, Israel (a Hebrew word), even though Jews were a small minority. Immediately, the U.S. and their western allies in the U.N. recognized sovereignty. You had no say. Suddenly, you're now living in a Jewish country.

The British initially supported the Islamic Palestinians and the Arab coalition (Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Egypt) but provided less than promised military support. The power-hungry King Abdullah of Jordan stabbed the Palestinians in the back because he made backroom deals with Ben Gurion to annex the West Bank. As such, he provided only nominal military support to the campaign despite being the most powerful military force in the region. 




 A college degree generally boosts your income over the rest of your lifetime (YMMV). Starting a business is riskier. Business loans are also often collateralized so you are going to risk assets like your home. 




 Jerusalem is important to Jews, Muslims and Christians. 




 The Palestinians did not the start the 6 day war or the 1948 war. They are caught in the middle. First, the country of Israel was just *declared* by David Ben Gurion. There wasn't any treaty between any parties. Western powers in the U.N. voted to recognize it so that it would be a place for Jews to go rather than have to accept post-WWII Jewish immigrants into their own countries. Prior to Ben Gurion, in the area that is now Israel only about 15% of the population were Jews.

The 1948 war and later the 6 day war were ostensibly over Palestinian rights but truthfully were political wars. Islamic Palestinians were the vast majority of the population but they were told by the Arab armed forces to flee the area, which they did. 700,000 of them. Israel won the '48 war and took the opportunity to basically lock the gate. The refugees were not allowed back into Israel (where they and their families had lived for millenia) nor into the neighboring countries and basically were stuck in the west bank, which was taken over by Jordan. Later, after the 6 day war, Israel took hold of that territory as well.

The Palestinians have been fucked by both sides throughout the history of this conflict. 




 Thanks. I never knew about ocular dominance. 









 Numerous studies show that Americans have been conditioned to identify the ".99" as being a bargain. Secondly, "9.99" also appears much less expensive than "$10.00" even though it's only by a penny.

As an aside, a ".95" are identified as being "a good value" (as opposed to the .99 bargain).
