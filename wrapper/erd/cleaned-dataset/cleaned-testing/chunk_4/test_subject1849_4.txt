 If they are in welfare, how can they afford to travel to California? 




 only Europe should be concerned of TTIP because America is their "developing" country for them. 




 Remember the Fox News welfare guy buying lobsters? he doesn't look obese at all. lol
 




 it just to do with the fact that our league doesn't have the finishing nor the midfield to allow our forwards to score. Though it is early in the season, so I expect scoring to pick up soon. 




 I am not a big fan of 0-0 draws or low scoring games to be honest. 




 I chose Harrington because he is a safe starter. $5 million less.  




 Michael Harrington 




 Use the Wildcard. You didn't plan it out, right beforehand. 




 it is not a problem. We just don't a system to encourage more diversity. if families of people wan to run for president go ahead, the candidates will be judged the fact that it is a family legacy. 




 omg... I go to Pandemonium was well. The one you are talking about is in Boston, right? 




 Kah might not start so I recommend  getting somebody that is more certain. 




 I wouldn't say Colorado's defense is weak. They are just heavily reliant on O'Neill and Moor to be healthy with Irwin in goal. 




 I used all my free transfers. I don't want to take  a -4 on a defender and maybe only get 2 points if no clean sheet. 




 Jack Jewsbury. He is listed as a defender, but he is playing more of a defensive midfielder role.  




 I think LA will probably get some goals on Vancouver this week. I think getting VAN defenders on the DGW is the better alternative. Kah vs Adekugbe is a tossup and uncertain.  




 I have Jewsbury, Ramos, and Opara as my defenders for this week. 
I have Neagle in midfield against Deric., but Martins and Dempsey are injuried. I have Arrieta in forward, yet facing Ramos. I don't have any Philly players on my team, so I am leaning on Marin for this week, but I do have Opara....so....Any thoughts?

 




 Designated Hitter in the National League or Having only a 8 man lineup is the easiest solution. Also, it would uniform the whole league in its rules. 

You could also wait decades to fix the low offense game, but every sport has made changes to its rules since its inception. Baseball rules have been altered throughout history. The game of the 1890s and 1920s is different from today's. What is interesting is that we had more offense and shorter games decades ago. 

There are other methods that would be more drastic:

Changing the Baseball's Matter, Alter the Bat's matter, Bring the Fences in, Treat all Fouls as nothing against the batter, Lower the Pitcher's Mound, 
 




 barbaroid the ultimate battle machine? 




 Burch wasn't a starter last year. After he filled in for Colorado with Moor and O'Neill out in injury, Colorado win/loss record went on a downwards spiral. I wouldn't get Burch since Colorado has done better this year with clean sheets with O'Neill on the team and without Burch, which is typical of Colorado. 




 Just watch yugioh Arc-v dub, if you want to see them in action.

Youtubers such as Cyberknight8610 and Azneyeswhitedragon have a lot of helpful yugioh videos as well. You can also find other youtubers as well. 




 We need a proportional multiparty system. Anything that has to do with districts will be gerrymandered.  




 There needs to be major infrastructure investment. 




 one way streets are very efficient since you don't spend so much time waiting at traffic lights. Also pedestrians and bikers benefit since they know the street only goes one way. 




 Dom Dwyer 




 All my spell cards turned into magic cards... 




 I would rather see how many Americans would support the Tea Party, Greens, Libertarians, and Socialists as parties  




 Also you got to remember that land is finite on the macro level so you need to increase housing for more people at the same time you have to increase land for farming. 




 It discourages density and creates sprawl, which has some major impacts environmentally. 




 I think this is a great add by Montreal, if this is true. 




 Dang... All my Spell cards turned into Magic cards today :\ 




 Honestly if you looked in Gallup polling on how Democrats Identified themselves in 1980s to 2008. You would notice that a lot of them were considered New Democrats and considered themselves "moderates" at the time. 




 Hence there should a multiparty system to show what Americans really believe in. 




 Don't get Altidore because he has no game the next week.  




 If so, then all countries should abolish borders, trade barriers, and end immigration restrictions.  




 YES! ROIDS! 




 West Ham United is renovating the London 2012 Olympic Stadium to fit in soccer. Also, the land used for the Olympics there is redeveloped for housing, science, schools, etc.  




 How is the Olympic Bid bad for the Revs? A Giant Stadium with tarp is better than a small stadium. Also, it removes any possibility that the Revs will need to relocate out of the small stadium for a bigger stadium.  




 Will the Revs stadium be part of the larger Boston 2024 plans?  




 Batteryman. Easy to OTK lol 




 I repied to a comment, which implied Democrats = Big Business, Income Inequality, Corruption, etc 




 So Democrats are now the party of business? I thought the Democrats stifled business growth.  




 I really regret transferring out Palmer for Sjoberg yesterday. I do have Peay if he plays :/ 




 better than nothing. after all. If they were to provide the exact # of days with free-service, then would lose double the amount of expected revenues for this year.  




 I like Canada's three to 5 party more so than US's system . It is very interesting how the stats reflect that divide.  




 You would still want a mix of residental, commerical, and industry in each city. Just varying amounts of sizes. 

If one city falters, then your other city would be crisis mode to import all those dirty industrial jobs back.  




 It isn't Post-Hoc Fallacy. This logic would also apply to debunk any Tax Cuts boosting jobs, Reagan's deflation/taxcuts boosting the economy, Republicans claiming Bush's economic growth is better than Clinton's because he got us out of the Tech-Bubble, Stimulus creating jobs, any government cuts/spending creating jobs, etc.

Anything in the Marco-Level economics can happen, so justifying Post-Hoc is really missing the whole point of economics. It is all about correlation and sometimes causation, but it also up for the intrepretation of stats.  




 It is also one of things that Obama and Republicans actually agree on yet both claim that they don't agree on anything lol 




 Because the Bay Area is one of the largest metro areas in the US. They can support 2 teams. California could potentially have 6 MLS teams, if people, who say it should be based on metro areas instead of states, get their way.  




 Seitz because LA's attacking subs are quite good. 




 How about San Fran and San Diego?  




 Yes. 




 I am surprised since Konami would like to promote Pendulum Summoning..... 




 Artifact Batteryman with WattFox as synchro. It can stun, punish destruction, OTK, Rank 5, Rank 4, and swarm. 




 So Jewsbury will most likely be starting? o.O 




 Batteryman 




 So.... Will Peay or Jewsbury play? o.O 




 Transfer out kaka for a different player? 




 Of course, the money has to come from somewhere for the owners, who will need to pay for the intial costs of building the stadium and the investment/planning costs to build it.  




 You can't be assured that it will be voted down unanimously . Just a few months ago, 60% of Bostonians supported it. Now, it is down to 30% support. The decline was mostly due to the public transit problems during the snow storms. 




 Yet somehow, Atlanta gets a stadium that is "too big" for soccer. 




 Once you have the Olympics, there is already a stadium for usage. Then, the State House could have the Olympics tax on sporting events to pay for the cost overruns.  




 Then, the Boston area "soccer specific stadium" will probably be postponed to a later date or until Kraft has an incentitive to find land, stadium already in the plans, etc. Right now, Kraft has no major incentitive to find the Revolution a stadium.  




 True, though this method has been used by DC United for its stadium.  They used land formerly used by industry.  




 Bandwagoners only apply to people not within range of a team's city location. 




 The Olympics Stadium would be near the South End and South Boston area where they have railroad tracks, red-line tracks, industry, parking lots, storage, etc.  




 Bringing the Olympics will provide Kraft and the Revs with a stadium. Also, the Olympics will allow the redevelopment of an area that is primarily used for industry. 
 




 A few months ago, 60% were in favor, until the MBTA crisis, which caused the numbers to fall to 30% in favor. I am sure that many want to see redevelopment, after the Olympics are over. 




 If soccer fans in New England want a soccer-specific stadium in Boston, then they should vote yes on the Olympics Referendum, if there is one. Of course, you vote no on specifics like taxpayer funded cost overruns, but still.  




 The cosmos could merge with the New York Red Bulls. 




 I have Peay on Bench. Should I place him in starting lineup in place of Jewsbury or should I allow auto sub if Jewsbury doesn't play? 




 thanks. I guess I'll transfer out Bradley and keep Duka as a sub in case some other potential staters don't start. 




 Soumare wasn't able to play in the previous game. Lost Clean Sheet points. D: Duka is injured. I am more concerned with Duka....Will he play? 









 One of the best. Without question better than zexal and maybe 5ds in terms of presentation and drama. 




 Syrus Truesdale vs Yugo? roids vs speedroids? 




 When O'Neill comes back, will Sjoberg lose his spot since Colorado's defense functions better with O'Neill there? Harrington was in both games this season with clean sheets. Is Harrington a safer option? 




 So if I get him over Harrington, we will expect similar production and have a starting role? 




 jewsbury is midfielder but labeled as a defender. he is going to pick up some attacking bonus points if Rivero does score goals. 




 When O'Neill comes back, will Sjoberg lose his spot since Colorado's defense functions good with O'Neill there? Harrington was in both games this season with clean sheets. Is Harrington a safer option? 




 GX themes will enter.  




 Does everybody hate the xy dimension? lol. I think this is Konami's way of ridiculing us since Zexal was notoriously disliked by fans?  




 Will GX characters enter arc-v as well? 




 WHEN IS THE BANLIST COMING OUT? 




 Don't forget Mexico's economy and social standing has not improved with all the violence and drug cartels. Also, our trade deficit has increased with Mexico. 




 NAFTA also didn't reduce illegal immigration rates to the U.S. 




 Roids and Cloudians 




 Roids don't have steroids.  




 Sure. I don't understand why Conservatives recommend minorities to vote Republican especially in the South, where governments are already GOP dominated at the state level. Voting GOP, will only increase the GOP's control on legislation and court system.   




 Agreed, but there is a vocal wealthy minority that opposes this more proportional system ever since James Madison's Federalist Papers, which warned about a pure democracy voting away rights of white property owners. Honestly, I have yet to see a proportional democracies in developed voting away rights of "minorities" left and right without a legal system.  




 All developed countries have parties vs parties. It is natural part of human greed and governing.  




 But there is no incentitive for them to vote Democrat. Why would they? Like how there is no incentitive for black southerners to vote Republican there. 




 You need a proportional system first. Then, you can modify it. 




 ay ay captain 




 not exactly. You can have a leftwing and rightwing coalition. example: Greece and Germany 




 True, but he still didn't deliver on his promise of ending the Bush Tax Cuts. here, obama agrees with the GOP somewhat.  




 They should make a list, where you can have 4 copies of a card. lol 




 Also parliamentary debates are more entertaining than Congressional debates. 




 yep. I know. the third party spoiler effect. progressive Party, Greens, Reform Party, and Dixiecrats, etc each have spoiled the two major parties in our history. 




 if all black southerners voted republican, the south would be a one party region. think about that. 




 Yes. it will take amending the Constitution, but it should be a good thing. There is way too many Americans for just 2 major political parties. Also, we need to make sure that the greens, libertarians, centrists, socialists, and fringes of ideologies are heard to keep in check in the powers of the establishment. 




 A better solution is getting rid of the 2 party system, not proportional and sometimes anti-majority electoral college, gerrymandered house districts, and corrupt Senate. We need more parties and more proportion when we are voting. We are always one party away from a one party nation. In fact, many states are already almost one party controlled. 




 MULTIPARTY System USA! 




 We should be focusing on a proportional multiparty system with majority governs or coalition forming than mandatory voting. Also, eliminating gerrymandering by reforming how we elect our politicians should encourage more voters. Our electoral college, house districts, and proportion of Senators need to be reformed. 




 Not on the Trans Pacific Partnership, corporate tax reform, Bush Tax Cuts, Marijuana, NSA, etc 




 MTL has blostered their defense and New England hasn't done well for this season. Fagundez should be a no go. Shipp doesn't have the defense nor the forwards to get assists + bonus points.  




 Speedroids 




 We need a proportional system with majority wins. 




 Effective Tax Rates back in the 1950s would still be higher than today's 0% effective tax rates
