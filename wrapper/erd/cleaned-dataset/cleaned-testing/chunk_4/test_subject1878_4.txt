 I did watch it, and it's more two comedians riffing at a zoo than actual shitty facts...

How about you resubmit with a particularly shitty fact quote from it as the title? 

Because the point of the sub is to look like it's a fact, not just the title to a video. 




 Point is it's pretty callous to reduce thousands of deaths to a math problem.  




 I'm sure the families of those 1,800 people would be comforted to know their loss isn't significant.  
























 Not a shitty fact, just a shitty video. Removed. 










































































 Thanks! I tried a few different titles before settling on this one. The first half was easy enough, but figuring out the shitty reason for howling took a little work.  




 That's what I figured, but he's also got that weird white bottom/brown and green top thing going on...

 Right!? It's a pale-throated three-toed, I believe, so that's why he has the orange face.  




 Heh, yeah. Not quite /r/misleadingthumbnails caliber though... 

































































































































 Checkmate, Fracktivists! 




 lol thanks. Looks like I'm at 2 now, so feel free to rescind your courtesy upvote. (I really only responded to make the Kayne-acceptance-speech reference...) 




 Look Kanye I'mma let you finish but the question wasn't about wehther the public opinion was useful or correct, it was what the opinion is, and whether this thread is a balanced representation of the general public.

I like your "it can't happen until it's viable" tautology though. Pretty useful opinion...  




 It may seem that way, but that's actually their ability to create optical illusions. Though mystical, cats can not in fact break the laws of physics.  




 Thanks! 




 ...huh. Weird. 

You know, I think this has happened before with PV-mag link. Worked when I posted it in the morning, then later in the day it went to the homepage. 

Note to self: No more PV-magazine submissions! 




 ...did someone comment before reading the whole title? 

enough to power 7.6 million U.S. homes, up from 360,000 in 2009 




 Thanks for that. There weren't any BTTF jokes yet, I was starting to worry! 




 Which is why the quote also includes hard numbers of amount produced and the 7.6 million home's worth of energy. 




 Reddit just has a knack for shitting all over anything. 

Plus the general fact that you're more apt to comment if you disagree than if you agree. 

Public sentiment is pretty strongly one-sided in favor of renewables (70-80% IIRC) 




 [Price has fallen 99% since 1977](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/10/06/2717791/cost-pv-cells-solar-power-grid-parity/). Dunno about efficiency. It's gotten a lot better, but probably not 99%...

 The algorithm, based on triangulation of reputable sources. From what I've read it's not for questions that are open to interpretation ("Is climate change dangerous") but matters of simple fact ("Was Obama born in Kenya?") so at least initially there should be little justification for accusations of bias.

 ? Yes, that is the same as the one I posted but without the most recent downturn post-2009...

 I am absolutely STOKED about the new Google algorithm. Though it may not (at least at the start) be sophisticated enough for the climate debate, since it uses the three-point verification and a lot of misinformation is just slightly too subtle to be covered like that. 

BUT the outlets that publish untrue stuff that it does pick up also publish climate misinformation, so hopefully there will be some cross-over perks... 




 Not sure what exactly you're asking, but I think the answer is the [various paleoclimate proxies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_%28climate%29)?  



















 Feature piece on a slightly esoteric but nonetheless important issue. What do we lose by a melting arctic, aside from the weather/climate/ecology repercussions? 

Is there value in adventure?
