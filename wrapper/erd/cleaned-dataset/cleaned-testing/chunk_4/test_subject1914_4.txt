 people don't wanna hear your shit they don't care about you or your problems 




 the cunts of this subreddit who can't take an obvious joke. the dickheads on here who make a beautifully subjective sport like football completely black white. Eg.  'Y pass was the best pass of all time' ' well i like X pass better' 'No your offence but you're wrong' so stupid. and plastic fans usually americans who don't have a fucking clue and pretend to know the in's and Out's of their clubs history and rivalries  do me a favour and fuck off back to the NBA. 
and Fuck the MLS its a terrible league i don't wanna read about 'why the MLS is an underrated league pattering for up votes from americans' 




 Congratz mate what an acheivement  




 thats just what i would do personally. 




 if you don't need the money and he's happy to stay keep him. no point selling your main striker if you don't need to 




 you guys don't rely on champions league football because you don't have it. 




 football manager has a good community the football manager subreddit is fantastic nice people informative replays. 




 you lot would probably burn it down
