 Thank you for not making this a fun fact post 




 Not that i disagree Iron Man 2 wasn't good, but that was a sequel that didn't carry much weight in the Marvel universe, while Man of Steel kicked off the DC universe with much less than a bang. 




 Can't Hold Us by Macklemore was fucking everywhere at one point. 




 True.....but fuck the eagles anyway!!! 




 Fucking fletcher actually does something fuck! DEFENSE PLEASE! 




 Are the eagles a fucking marching band, they are just marching down that field 




 Woah really thought RG3 went down 




 We are just giving  away yards to Ertz, 

Secondary: Yo Ertz you need some yards?

Ertz: Uhhh sure you guys gonna cover me still?

Secondary: Helllllll nah, take em 




 Yeah I feel an turnover coming  




 An interception would be a nice dagger  




 A nice dose of reality, fucking defense 




 Did no one else hear Gannon say play cock! 




 Sooooo play cock amiright? 




 Nope! 




 Fucking epitome of facepalm 




 I'll take an interception with a side of pick 6 




 While I do agree they need a better oline, they haven't been doing that bad today. Secondary though......yeah 




 Even if we win this game on some miracle pick 6 Haslett needs to go 




 Wow everyone but Breeland needs to be gone on this secondary 




 Right in the hands gotta bring that down

Lose to Colts: It wasn't his fault defense lost us that game, similar to RG3's game against the Texans

Lose to Giants: Ehhh could be better, he's not good, but not horrible, keeps under throwing Desean. 

Lose to Eagles: PUT RG3 IN THE FUCKING GAME!

Lose to Cowboys: Well Fuck
