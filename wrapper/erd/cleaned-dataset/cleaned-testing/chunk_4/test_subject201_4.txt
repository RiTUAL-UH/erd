 let me know how you do, dont burn the house down. 




 This was from about 10 yards. I started out from farther back but ended up moving in closer cause I wasn't doing well. Its really fun. I noticed the flame goes out if the pellet is at lease about an inch away from the flame.  




 Agreed, Title sucks too. 









 I really dig your style. My last name is also Turner and I also have a similar style. Turners rule. 




 You should post this to R/wallpapers.
 




 This is pretty cool. Nice find 









 I think it helps to turn the brightness down on your TV. If that doesn't work try sitting father away from the TV. Or maybe try some motion sickness pills? 




 No problem 




 I ended up making that tutorial. I broke the one in this picture and figured it would be good opportunity to show the process. [ENJOY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiklhUbSCVg feature=youtu.be) 




 The vics where just some extra pills I got. I usually do methadone and Xanax, that's my thing. And oxys and anything else good when I can get my hands on it. I try to stay away from APAP but these vics where free. 




 Believe it or not, those red speckles are the hydrocodone. The rest of the white is all APAP. I've been board before and tried to separate them. Long story short. Not worth it.  




 Thanks, only certain people recognize that when they look at my table. Theres all kinds of stuff like that all over it. 




 I don't but I could make some and post it. Now that I think of it I really should share my plans because its amazing how effective it is. The difference is like popping a balloon with a pin and untying the knot and letting the air out slow. PM me if you need the plans asap. But I will make some and post it on this sub. 




 Defiantly let it pass through. I did a lot of research/ trial and error before coming up with this. What happens when the bullet travels through the tube air is escaping out the holes and you want as much of that air to go away as possible so do away with the inner tube. Tried it and it works way better. 









 Yes the silencer is functional and work VERY well at suppressing the sound. It is modeled from how a real suppressor is made and works but with much less expensive material. The barrel is made from 3 aluminum cans (short v8 cans) and the 3 air breaks are made from 3 aluminum energy drinks that have a screw on cap. I also hot glued cotton around the chambers to further reduce the noise which works great. Its amazing the difference. It fits nice and snug with no screwing thanks to a sharpie pen that fits into the 1/4 inch hole after the muzzle. Anymore questions let me know. 




 Thats for taking the time to take the picture! Thats a sweet set.  



















 I got the shaker and glass from a friend that gave it to me when he moved but thats all I got, no shot glasses. What do those look like? I use it all the time/ Best free thing I've ever gotten. 









 I think its fun as hell. It has 3 fail/safes and isn't stupid. Maybe a little dangerous but that's what makes it fun. You rocket guys on here are all so stuck up. Apparently I'm the only one that thinks this is cool.

 haha I know. Once they know I have a treat they do every trick they know back to back. The tricks arn't hard to teach but obedience is. 









 Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it!

 yea, the Enzo model doubles as a pizza cutter. 




 He looks like a mexicano 




 One of the fastest ways to cool off hot food off I've encountered yet. Its right up there with holding it out of a car window driving down the interstate. Without the risk of getting bugs in it.

 This is really amazing. I've never seen this before. Thank you for sharing the link. 




 Thanks you! People can be really harsh with their critics on this subreddit sometimes though. I hate when I just finish a piece that I put so much time and effort into and then just get down votes with no comments or reasons for them. I guess what i'm saying is keep your chin up if people want to be dicks. I know I have too. I think your really talented with your digital brush. Keep it up! 




 It's great that you took in consideration to blur the snowflakes. It gives the piece movement and makes you feel the womens chill from the wind. Nice job. I use Photoshop and paint and do stencil work but from what I know this takes mad patience. 




 This is exactly what I got today. 4 subs and everything! Care to share what they cost in your neck of the woods? there pretty expensive in my area. 




 [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/NauyCcj.jpg) is what I started from. I'm not sure what your referring to. 




 I prefer the cap for my type of work. I like the angled spray for stencles and obviously regular caps for actual graffiti. I'm a street ARTIST not a penis maker. I use what works I find it funny that krylon supports anti graffiti campaigns because I steal there paint and do it anyways. And as far as drips go, if your experienced enough you can control it. Go fuck yourself.
