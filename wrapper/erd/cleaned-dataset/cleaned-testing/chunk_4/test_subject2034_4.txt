 What truly repulsed me about American Psycho was its brain numbing repetition. Someone should tabulate what percentage of the text the author used to describe the designer clothing of each of his interchangeable characters. Was it five percent? No, ten percent is better estimate. Yes, I get the joke Yuppies are both predatory and superficial. For me, all the humor of the book dies long before the first victim. It seemed the graphic episodes of sex and violence had to become increasingly overwrought, as desperate attempts to hold my attention.
Do not think I am a prude or especially squeamish. In my current cycle of reading, I have read Blood Meridian, Naked Lunch and JG Ballards Crash, and found merit in each of those violent and perverse works. With American Psycho, I found myself slogging to its end, my only motivation being to see if the ending made it as pointless as I expected it to be. An admission  I had seen the film adaption, and was curious if the novel had the same, disappointing conclusion. Pretty much, it did, only reading the novel took me many more, painful hours to reach it. A pity, as American Psycho does contain the elements for a potent and insightful piece of short satire.
 




 English was not Nabokov's first language either. He was Russian exile from the Bolshevik Revolution, and I recall that he wrote novels in German while living there, before his peregrinations took him to France and eventually to the USA. English might have been his third or fourth language; if so, as does Conrad, he leaves we who scribble in our native language with a great embarrassment. 




 A few years ago, I decided I needed to read Lolita, as it consistently appeared near the top of the critic's list. I was already a fan of Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel, which he deftly adapted as a dark comedy. He could not have done otherwise, as the novel is one of the few great works of horror. Unlike the puerile, supernatural plot of The Shining, Lolita is a work that examines a purely human evil, and so has been untranslatable to film. I too have read American Psycho and found it disgusting: it is a clumsy, exploitive, and tedious satire. Not Lolita; Nabokov can seduce you with his lyrical prose, so that you feel you are on some scenic cruise of 1950's America. I often found myself riding along and mocking his pathetic, self-pitying narrator, when, unexpectedly, Nabokov slammed me with a sledgehammer, a brief and causal observation to remind me that I was inside the mind of a very plausible monster.

It is a difficult book, but rewarding as a rare insight into how a twisted mind excuses its depredations. For those who finish it, I would recommend reading a critical review of the novel afterward. Doing so, I found had completely missed some key aspects, and was left further amazed at Nabokovs subtle approach to horror.
 




 Along its coast, California continues to witness signs and wonders. This beach at San Diego appears almost biblical in its portent. Those who advocate the creation of a Greenhouse Earth often cite the pause in global warming as evidence that any climate change catastrophe will not occur for several more election or business cycles. Some climatologists dispute that any significant pause has occurred while others hypothesize that much of the greenhouse heat has been accumulating in the deep oceans. From Nature, 2014:

The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. These winds normally push sun-baked water towards Indonesia. When they slackened, the warm water sloshed back towards South America, resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as El Nio. Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998  and then the warming stalled

Scientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as Novembers Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. You cant keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific, Trenberth says. At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back. And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.

 Are they culturing mammalian cells to produce this artificial meat?
If so, scaling up the process would be a continuous challenge, as cell culture requires stringently sterile procedures to prevent contamination by opportunistic bacteria, fungi, etc. The current beef industry is heavily dependent on antibiotics, which are becoming ineffective, and at least a cow has an immune system. My favorite ice cream manufacturer is currently on hiatus, as it attempts to cleanse its facilities of Lysteria, so I am skeptical of the commercial viability of artificial meat.    




 I do not kill any snails found in the vegetable garden. I re-locate them to the compost heap. Techno-optimists like Stewart Brand believe that the species that we have driven to extinction will be resurrected through cloning, but they only propose this for charismatic creatures like the wooly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. They have not imagined the need for a 'Gastropod Park'.
