 Remember that even in the darkest times you are loved. I love you. Everyone in r/anxiety loves you! You can push through whatever it is you are going through. 




 Please respond to me.  




 Hey! Don't go do anything crazy friend. Wanna talk?  




 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. - Frank Herbert, Dune

It's more of a quote than a short phrase but it's always helped me. 
 




 Yeah, I agree.  




 Yeah, I remember after my test driving became a lot easier. No pressure when your by yourself.  




 Most TED talks nowadays are like this. 




 Holy fucking shit dude are you me? You pretty much explained exactly how I feel. I am constantly scared of HIV. I had a drunken night with a shady girl, got tested and was negative. Yet now after a night of drinking wherein I got blackout drunk, I am convinced that I somehow got infected through a needle or something. It's like no matter what happens, I'm always going to be anxious about having a serious disease. My lymph nodes have also always been enlarged. I feel like I get all the exact symptoms of HIV. It's crazy. It's literally my worst fear to get it. 

The point is though, we don't. We simply don't have it. If you were to get tested, you would just move on to something else to worry about. The problem isn't HIV, cancer or meningitis, the problem is your anxiety. I feel like a lot of the time you get fear mongering advice like "always get checked, found a lump? get checked. GO TO THE DOCTOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY". You know what I think of that advice for people with hypochondria? fuck it. That type of advice is for people who never worry. When you have anxiety or hypochondira, the only thing you can truly do to sort yourself out is to go to a doctor and get your anxiety sorted out! It is literally a mental illness and it will fucking ruin your life way worse than any disease would. 

I'm in the same boat as you dude. However I try to realise that anxiety is the issue here not the diseases. This quote is really meaningful to me http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Walter-White-Quote-On-Spending-Your-Whole-Life-Being-Scared-In-Breaking-Bad.jpg. 

Hope you read this! :)

 I BE RUNNIN THROUGH THE 6 WITH MY WOES. UNOHOWDASHITGOES 




 That's exactly like how I felt. Your mind just feels so clear and unclogged. I'm clearly no expert but I feel like anxiety is a problem that only modern society really ever gets. There is no significant biological difference between humans now and humans for the last few thousand years but humans for the last few thousands of years have actually had to do physical activities just to survive. Whereas now people sit down on a computer working 9-5 jobs and then go home and watch Netflix just feeling miserable. Biologically, we need to do physical activity to stay healthy. Technology has just fucked it up for us which is why you got to find the time to do exercise outside of work.
