 OMG! You are literally the cutest thing ever! 3 Whats your ring size? 




 lol, yeah.. 




 I'm sure everyone here will be saying the same thing, but fuck those people! Like what you like, and don't be ashamed of it. If you lose friends because of the music you listen to, then they aren't the kind of friends you want to keep around. OR, they may respect you for being unashamed of it, and like you more. It may even open their eyes to the genre. "Well, they like EDM, and they're cool, so maybe EDMs not so bad." Or, and this isn't recommended, but if you wanna be more passive with it, just play it off as a joke. If they catch you listening to electronic music and laugh at you, just be in on the joke. They'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you all have a good time. The best way to deal with a bully is to laugh with them, as opposed to letting them laugh at you. 




 You look amazing 




 Sexy doesn't even begin to describe you 




 Itd be a crime to not post it :) 




 You totally do. The question is, which Alex are you going as? Prison Alex? Orange or Khaki? Rockabilly Alex? etc. 




 I downloaded one of my favorite DJs sets from (I think EDC last year) and he opened with "they call me (his name)" and it made me cringe, cause that's just such a douchey thing to say. I love his music, but sometimes he just says douchey things. 




 The greatest song in the world. Duh... 




 I'd love to taste your frosting ;)
