 :-)  thanks for checking up on me.  Its not fixed yet.  MB and processor got fried.  I think I'll have it replaced soon though.  




 Moderately sure you havent seen the actual video in question, so you dont know what you are talking about. 




 you telling me he didnt pay for that black belt? 




 I used to see them often as a kid.  I havent seen any in decades. 




 IIRC, this makes for a great repost/oc complaint gif.  Haven't seen it in years, but I'm certain this is it.  The guy with the stalled bike is "oc" while all the reposts are flying past him. 




 If Timmy was white, he'd be the one checking the bag. 




 plus it would be inappropriate in your position to do so.  you dont do that to your co-workers - especially the show talent.

 You're doing deitys work. 




 First thing I thought as well.  I dont think that white kid has 100% faculties. 




 Until I moved to SoCal, I never thought such a small amount of water could be destructive.  As someone originally from the NorthEast, it was a bizarre concept to wrap my head around.  Seeing is believing. 




 I was in agreement with everything until the last paragraph:

 Ultimately, The Joker arguably carries the whole thing off just to prove how clever he is, but its difficult to claim youre an agent of chaos when you put quite that much work into making sure that absolutely everything goes your way  even if its never entirely quite clear exactly what your way is.

The Joker has historically been a criminal mastermind who revels in the chaos he causes around him.  I dont see how that has anything to do with the fact that he has multi-leveled formulated plans. 




 I suggest you not underestimate the staggering drawing power of the Garden State, and show up two hours in advance.

 Any time I am reminded of Star Wars, I *always* hear this shout. 




 no one wants these, and they only work in specific theater setups that they are designed for.  They are super cheap and are otherwise worthless.  Im not even sure your $2 value is correct. 




  due to the atmosphere of the entire organization and past events

Can you elaborate on that?  This has happened before?  Has been allowed before?  Certainly if this is something that has been allowed in the past - that, as you say, it should not have been unexpected. 




 you're either blind or tragically indifferent.   I love a good fight, but that was a literal beating.

 Are these staged fights with ex-cons really "street fights"?  This shit is kind of disgusting, having inexperienced fighters getting their asses handed to them.  That previous one with the white guy knee dropping the unconscious hispanic guy was fucking horrible.

I feel like these should be in a different sub.  There is nothing remotely fight-worthy going on.  Its just someone getting the shit kicked out of them in a completely staged and out-classed way. 




 jesus fucking christ. 




 Some outstanding points:

1. we dont know anything about the video encoding/bitrates you are trying to playback.
2. we dont know anything about the throughput from your NAS.
3. You say the videos dont playback, and so you "invariably rip a higher bitrate version"?

Some things to do:

1. Get file transfer stats to/from your NAS.  On windows, this is a very small/convenient tool:  http://www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1.html
2. Test against another Plex client.

 this is only container/audio info.  what is the video encoding?  what are the bitrates involved? 




 It looks like an indoor entrance to an outdoor pool. I've seen similar at mountain resorts.  Its also similar to the separate male/female entrances to shared spa pools. 




 Let them kick our butt in skyscrapers.  They have way more people than we do, and they are killing themselves. 




 Oh wow, I never saw those come up on my front page.  Thanks for the links. 




 Interesting!  Thanks for the info. 




 Thank you so much for your help! 









 Does this happen with direct play or transcoding?  I have a Samsung UN60H6350 (quad-core), and I am able to playback highly-encoded videos just fine - but saying that in a non-technical manner is kind of meaningless.  Specs are what will tell you if something is a yay or nay in terms of compatibility.

Can you give us any additional details about the encoding of the videos?  Are you making them yourself?  Perhaps you can re-encode in a manner that is more compatible with your specific TVs decoding capabilities.

As an example, I can easily direct-play across a 802.11g WLAN from a c2007 Sony VAIO Core 2 Duo - and that thing is an outdated piece of crap.  I can transcode too, but it beats the hell out of the processor (100% pegged).   If having to transcode from it, I run scripts to stop all sorts of things from running on it (tasks and services) to drop it to the greatest amount of processor availability I can.

I honestly think your problem is with the coding of the videos specifically.  Something is probably out of spec there. 




 could be.  a bunch of it was shot in LA. 




 that amount of blood had to be from the nose. 




 In my experience, LA drivers are worse than NYC drivers for the same reasons you have listed.

 Was that a Raimi peeking through the window?  

I never saw this movie (I know, for shame!) 




 You need to get the carpet properly tested to show/prove allergens.  Otherwise, what you are saying is just lip-service.  Document the bedbugs as well, and show them the documentation - *dont just talk about it*.   They should be highly motivated about the bedbugs because of the risk of infestation and spreading.  The allergens as a proved health risk should also motivate them.

You can then use that same documentation against them if you decide to escalate the matter. 




 The Joss Whedon portion of the interview runs from 2:30 - 30:30.

 Thanks for your reply.

No cropping on my part - whats shown is the full extent of the image (it was a still image, not a moving image).

Its from one of the Evangelion "rebuild" movies, and is an image that is shown very briefly during some dramatic dialog, so I cant help but wonder if there is some hidden meaning/text that goes beyond simply "crew room" or "crew compartment".

I wonder that sometimes a word or two in Japanese means one thing, but has similar pronunciations that mean something else that is more devious.

The location of this sign is on a train.  I believe part of it says "crew compartment", but I cannot translate the rest.  Any help would be greatly appreciated and may better help understand what is going on in the scene. 




  crew compartment

I agree that is part of it, but I think there is more

 Note, BiteSMS's contact address is:

U0065, 3rd Floor, Jalan OKK Awang Besar, Wilayah Persekutuan, 87007 Labuan, Malaysia

This is a *front* address for many various "companies" that you can find online.  I'm not saying this un-legitimizes BiteSMS, but IMHO its sketchy for a legit company to share a mailing address.

I loved their product, I paid for their product, and I miss it.  But I dunno to what extent I would call them a "legit company" outside of a couple of devs. 




 If I couldn't imagine it before, I can now! 




 FWIW, we dont know if he's dead-dead.  The death was offscreen (which is weird when dealing with focal characters), and our only reference to it is a photo. 




 How was it determined that folder was the problem?  I'm assuming it was an issue with something that was in the folder, and not the folder name itself?

 This must have been blowing so many of those dancers minds. 




 ohh, totally wooshed me on that.  ty. 




 That sounds logical, but in this sub, I really dont find that to be true - aside from the negativity regarding something Marvel aspect.

You should be hive-mind allowed to express a passionate negative opinion. 




 Ahh, just when I've thought I've seen everything! 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjBLuTwT6mM t=10 




 what was it? 




 Amazing, I understood all of that expect for "PoC".  What have I missed? 




 I dont even know what your talking about (cause I dont look back and track votes), so who cares.   




 Yay!  I care! 




 Yes.  You either boost or retard the audio to approximate an audio level that is consistent with your volume. 




 In a long tracked shot like this, the cuts are always when a head is turned just as a speedup takes place or just took place to take advantage of motion blurring.  Thats when you have stunt actors swapped in/out and or simply have different takes combined.  

The sequence looks awesome, but this is not a single take.  Its tracked, and is a composite. 




 Thanos and Ultron are on different levels. 




 I hate that this sub downvotes opinions.  You paraphrased what my GF said last night after watching AoU - that she was disappointed that Ultron was not more bad-ass.

Then I had to turn in a "well, in the comics" dork and explain how/why he really is, etc.  :-/ 




 This is a great chart:

 Exactly.  You let people pull that shit, in front of other people, you are just asking to get rolled in the future.  If he's a dealer, he had to *keep it real*.  I hate the expression, but it is what it is. 




 You take someones shit (whatever that may be), and dont give it back or give them the money for it, you deserve a punch in the face. 




 maybe a known groper in that area, and someone planned some justice?  its obviously not first-hand CNN video. 




 Just live. 




 This has been a long-standing unaddressed complaint on the XBMC side for years.  The best thing we accomplished on XBMC was individual audio settings per-video.   Meaning that per-video, you could set audio increase/decrease settings to normalize the title to your default audio settings.  Its a bit annoying, but it gets the job done and you only have to tweak the problematic titles. 




 I hope Marvel has a HQ digital-double of this man. 




 Yea, but I added something new - so go fuck yourself. 




 Holy crap - I was really young at the time, so I didnt realize the mother got a life sentence for that incident.  At least that was eventually dismissed. 




 Then you just upvote it.  Everything else you post is a waste of time unless it adds something new to the conversation.

 I don't take that as a joke.  Its a common correlation that is noticed during the spring.

Although there are many months that are recorded to have nearly the same crime statistics year-round, many graphs show a dip in crime during the coldest months of winter (about 2 months worth) which then slowly build through the spring and then plateau until the next deep winter drop.
