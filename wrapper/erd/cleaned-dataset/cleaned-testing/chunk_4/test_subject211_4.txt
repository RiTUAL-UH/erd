 i'd recommend just meditating. Don't try and do anything advanced just sit in a comfortable spot, if you have it the put on some calming soft music at a relatively low volume. Sit down in your comfortable spot, it should be somewhere where you can relax and no one will bother you, though if you can then try and have atleast some sunlight coming down on you.

After you find somewhere that works, sit down, with your music on and sit in whatever position is most comfortable. I sit in the classic cross-legged "buddhist" position but it really doesn't matter so long as you're comfortable, you can relax, and your spine's straight. Speaking of which, when you sit down. Make sure to keep your spine straight, this is very important and should never be neglected.

After you sit down in a comfortable position close your eyes and begin breathing slowly. Inhale for two seconds through the nostril, hold the air in for two seconds, exhale for two second, and keep the air out for 2 second. Repeat this cycle while clearing your mind of stray thoughts. The way I do this is by recognizing a thought in my brain and simply easing it away, once your mind is clear begin relaxing your body, continue breathing deeply and straighten your spine while concentrating on a body part and visualizing it slowly dissipating into nothingness. start out by doing this to your fingers and then your arms, feet, legs etc until your entire body is relaxed.

Now that you're relaxed simply continue to breath and keep your mind clear of stray thoughts. If you had any objectives then you should do them now. Keep your mind clear, your spine straight, and your breathing stable for about 15 minutes. After a decent amount of time has passed while you're relaxed slowly begin to move your body parts, wiggle a toe or a finger and slowly bring yourself out of the meditative state.

After the meditation I'm usually a little sore from sitting for so long so just get up and walk around a bit, eat some food and have something to drink.

Don't worry if you can't do all this on your first try. It took me several weeks of meditation to be able to do it regularly. Once you can do this easily and quickly (5 minutes or less to get to meditative state) then you should be able to do most other rituals.

 Wat 




 ^teehee 




 I'm in a similar situation, I've beaten the game 10 or so times now, I've gone good legion, bad legion, good NCR, bad NCR, Good house, Bad House, all 3 independents, I've played through all DLC 15 or so times. I've reached lvl 50 3 times and my first save has every unique weapon and all the gold from the sierra madre as well as all locations visited.

It took me about 100 hours to do that one save file and I have about 600 hours altogether in NV but the ending...

I mean, they could've just released a DLC to continue it like they did with 3. I think the reason they didn't do it was because it was too ambitious. They'd have to make hundreds of different version of the mojave because even doing something slightly different changes the ending. To measure up they'd have to make sure your decisions are reflected everywhere. That'd take way to much time and way to much money for one $15 DLC to make it worthwhile. 




 Fallout: New Vegas. The game was amazing and definitely ranks up there in my top 10 games of all time. Probably my top 5 even, but when I finally beat Lanius and general Oliver congratulated me I expected something... More, it just plays the epilogue and you have to go back to a save from before the battle at hoover dam. This was exactly what people didn't like about Fallout 3 and I understand they didn't have a post game because of time-restraints but....

I wish they had atleast had a DLC which continued it. The ending was okay, but in comparison to the rest of the game it just left me feeling empty and wanting more. 









 *Sips mountain dew out of goblet.* 




 That is super easy, omegle sends your IP through video and that can be traced to a city. I've done it myself a few times, super funny for trolling. They get so freaked.

All you need is wireshark and the ability to know how to use it.

Edit: [Here's a video about how to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgAZuh5FPg) 




 This made my fucking day. 




 Oh. So the government should be allowed to run up massive amount of debt and pay none of it back while I would A: get my knees broken. Or B: Have to declare bankruptcy? for doing the same?

Seems legit. 




 Learning how to make a stable budget is important. In fact, it's so important that the government has to do it! 

...Oh wait... 




 They're scaled down in that a martial artist can't just punch a hole through the universe, (a la kame sennin ryu) The fighters can use all the super duper techniques they want but can only apply as much force and speed as an Olympic level human. The guy you're talking about, (no idea who he is BTW) could use his aikido but he would only be able to do it as quickly as a normal human being, he couldn't jump 50 feet in the air he could jump 5, He couldn't punch through a concrete wall but he could punch through an interior wall.

If a certain ability couldn't be used by someone who lacks the superhuman strength of that character then the character simply can't use it. 




 Every real martial art including all major styles fights along with all fictional martial arts. All martial arts gets the greatest ever practitioner of the art to represent them, if a martial art has it's practitioner be stronger than a normal human athlete (IE: Kenshiro or Goku), they will be scaled down to only be able to do what a olympic athlete human can do. Ki blasts are allowed but they can't be any stronger than a punch and take twice the effort of throwing that punch physically.

If a martial art involves the use of weapons as a requirement (Like kendo or fencing) they will be given a standard quality version of the weapon made of either metal or wood, however, martial arts which have weapons as optional (Like aikido) are not given weapons and are only allowed to use their fists.

No rules are enforced so hits to the groin and gouging of the eyes are perfectly fine.

The arena is a large, flat stadium with more than enough room for all competitors.

Round 1: All real martial arts in a team VS all fictional martial arts in a team.

Round 2: Free for all, all martial arts against each other, alliances can be formed but only one can stand at the end.

Round 3: free for all in which fictional martial arts are no longer allowed to use any form of ki/energy attacks.

Round 4: All competitors are given SMG's, Automatic shotguns, and chainsaws, which art lasts the longest. 




 Kenshiro, he dies in the first episode from bleeding after Shin cuts his arms and legs.

Alternatively, Toki dies when he gets his legs get smashed from the boulder after he fell down the cliff with raoh. 




 Man, you need to check your facts. He was way taller, i heard he was like, twelve stories high. 




 Actually, I'll one up you and say the doctor **does** exist. Just not in this universe.

If you go off multiverse theory then every possible eventuality has happened, is happening, and will happen. So, the doctor has to exist hundreds of trillions of times, but in all likelihood he just doesn't exist in this universe. 




 Leave any questions you have about satanism or Satan below and one of the mods will answer promptly. 




 I myself am in a very similar situation to yours. I too live in a christian household and I'm thus, unable to perform any rituals beyond meditation before bed. What I'd recommend is thus. If you want to contact your guardian demon, either find a time when your family is gone and perform a summoning ritual then. Or try and astral project. By astral projection you could seek the guidance of a guardian demon. However, what I would most strongly recommend is to simply wait. You've already made admiral progress simply by recognizing these truths and by partaking in power meditations, no one expects you to do anything more. Simply keep meditating and wait until you're old enough to move out of your families house. 




 And the sky will begin raining money as pigs fly by. 




 This is the only real answer. 




 Yes! I haven't finished it but I got it for free a while back. I honestly prefer it to fallout 1 (though not fallout 2) as though it isn't as deep it is a lot more fun. I really like the multi-person squad and with more people and faster paced gameplay it can really fun at some points. 




 Well, Not saying I agree with them. but airplane tickets cost so much that you should get bigger seats then what they give you. 




 [NOTHING AT ALL.](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/15/1599e06bd7b11b9d1e3d414c4cfb97bd3ad4ed044ac06d4ec5625cf4d0d224ec.jpg) 




 I don't think I eat that much in a fortnight. 




 I too enjoy human beans. They are delicious. 




 only to the main question. not to comments on the question. 




 Being a magician/warlock just means you use ritual to somehow gain power. Aesthetically being a magician/warlock just means you somehow internalize your power through ritual and end up becoming a stronger person IE: you become more motivated, you begin working out more. stuff like that. (I can't elaborate very well on the subject as I myself am a theistic satanist)

Theistically being a warlock/magician is invoking satan and his demons to help you in a task IE: Attracting money towards you through ritual. Or you use meditation to program your own aura to do something IE: make people more attracted to you. Personally I prefer the later option as it empowers you more and gives you more control.

If you have any more questions PM me with them. [Here's a list of spells that I often use in meditation but they are by no means the only spell. experiment and find what works for you. But remember affirmation is probably the best way to program your aura](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Magick.html) 




 *Immediately snaps afterwards.* 




 It's Dolomite baby! 




 Finally! support for my browser! 




 der funny's 




 about 8:00 PM me thinks. 




 I'm hoping D.C think of all the satire they could make about politics. And one of the player characters could be a politician even. the missions could be about gaining power in the political system and it could talk about how effed up the US government is. Just an idea though. 




 I think it should happen at 5:00 PM for you. of course thats assuming my brain can do maths. 




 Nope. just found image links and HTML/CSS nothing of any note. I guess we'll just have to see what happens. 




 Made ninja edit there. 




 What timezone you in? I can tell you when it will end in your timezone if I know it. 




 [It's a reference to a small thing in TF2. It's a joke how every time someone says there's gonna be a huge update you retort with bread.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bread) 




 Although it's unlikely I think that we could very well be seeing some sort of OB2 scenario going on here. Think of all the hints going on. L4D2 being free on christmas like portal 1 was before portal 2 was released, The alleged leaked screens of source 2.0, End of the line sounds like a final update to me. and now this? I'm probably wrong but I think that this right now might be the single most likely time that valve could release a new game.

And that game just might be.... ricochet 2 ^or.. ^you ^know ^~~HL3~~ ^a ^DoD ^sequel... 




 I don't know about you guys.... but my body's ready.

Ninja edit.
