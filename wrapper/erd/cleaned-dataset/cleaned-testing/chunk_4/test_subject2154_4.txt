 He was comically far away from the ball on that slide. I do not miss watching him play defense at all 




 To me, the popularity of YA novels has a lot to do with the accessibility of the emotion in them. It doesn't tend to be couched in philosophy or overly complicated (which is not to say they can't be emotionally nuanced); it's just that the characters feel in a way that resonates with how people feel. 

A lot of the time in literary/more serious fiction, the book is exploring those emotions and what makes them work/how they come to pass/how we can understand those emotions more. Which is hard work that a lot of people don't want to do or are intimidated by.  




 That is insane. 




 To be fair, none of those have been articulated. He's just getting downvoted to shit. 




 I actually don't dislike you guys, despite the fact that we're gonna have a crazy battle in the division this year..

But Rodney I can't stand and love watching him struggle. 




 We're almost as bad I think.  




 :(  




 Made it to Saturday's game versus the Royals. Can't beat them lately haha. 




 Trout is a pretty funny guy. He's normal as hell, but that doesn't mean he has no personality.

Pujols' persona is a machine, but even then he goofs off with everybody. He's just not that way to the media because he doesn't want to be.

Have you ever seen this: http://deadspin.com/pujols-trout-mock-fernando-rodneys-arrow-celebration-1608225059

Maybe not the most eccentric thing ever done, but Angels fans loved it. 




 Clearly you follow the team.. 




 Well that's a good way to honor a "classy, professional and hard working" guy; be a dick in his name. 




 One minor correction: Rule 5 selections are bought from their current teams for 50k, and if they do not stay on the 25-man roster for the entire year, must be offered back to their original team for half price (12.5k). They don't automatically go back to the original team. 




 I'm not saying your content is wrong or unwarranted; it's totally vaild analysis. Your tone is just overly hostile. It's extremely common for fans of a particular CBB team to knee-jerk and say that a guy isn't ready for the next level when they declare their intentions to leave. People wanted to see him stay (for selfish reasons), and they're upset that's not gonna happen. I'm not sure if you've read the other threads in here with players declaring, but every fan base does it. It's silly and short-sighted, but it doesn't deserve a curb-stomping. 




 I'd argue that it happens more often once you get a big lead cuz then the bottom part of the bullpen starts throwing innings, and those guys are in the bottom tier of the bullpen for a reason. 




 I had a spiral fracture in the fifth metacarpal and never got a cast...granted I should have. But I was playing basketball again within a month. 




 Yeah no. It's obviously shitty but this is a bad idea. Unless you make an extremely strong case that he went out there intending to hurt a guy, you don't do this. 




 Andrew Luck also was in a position to turn down the money. Not everyone is blessed with the financial and familial stability to do so. 




 You're right, but shit man. Chill out a bit. 




 Kinda surprised there's no Infinite Jest in here, but I'll throw it in. Although I guess you can say stuff happens. To me, the action-to-length ratio is way way way small enough to be included here. 




 You have to get lucky to win in baseball. You guys got lucky last year. You're still a good team. Doesn't mean you're not lucky. You won't keep hitting .329 with a .401 OBP as a team. 

Enjoy it but please don't pretend like it's anything other than what it is: a hot start. 




 I was at that game. Still cannot believe he threw him out. Watching the throw in person was just silly. Stadium didn't really know what happened lol. 




 Because there was no fielding error committed on the first play, but there was on the second play. First play is two steals, second play is a steal and a throwing error.

It's definitely not reflective of what actually happened (incompetence on both plays), but since no one physically misplayed the ball, there is no error. A similar situation is when a fly ball drops between two people who both thought the other person had it. Obviously it should've been caught, but no one dropped/missed it, so it can't be counted as an error.

TLDR: Fielding errors have too narrow of a defintion, so sometimes people get rewarded with stats even though dumb plays were made. 




 I think 7:00 PST, not EST. 




 That moment. Makes me cry every time. 




 Thank you for someone knowing that. I work at a university, it's astounding how many people think you can do stuff like that. 




 Yeah haha it was really annoying.

Honestly what did us in was our batting average with RISP. 2 for 25 on the series. That's just not gonna get it done, ever, in any circumstance. 




 Oh I just hate Aoki cuz of his catches in Game 2. Both of them were miracles and he taunted our crowd after both. Which I'd love against anyone but my team and now hate him for 




 We're taking you down this weekend, and getting a tiny little shred of revenge for the ALDS..

But seriously your team is so much fun it's hard hating you. Especially now that Aoki is gone, dude was a clown in Game 2. 




 Dude he did a great job this year. Not saying the best job, but it's far from indefensible to choose him. His team was predicted 9th in the Big 12. 




 I'd be curious to see who was off by more percentage points in each game's win probability. Although that sounds like lots of arithmetic. 




 The score is still Q to 12, by the way. 




 Thank you. Thank you so much. 




 Why have I never heard of this. This is so cool.

They also stream all the games here: http://pit2015.net/

Sooo I know what I'm doing this weekend. 




 Well, that is the main problem with a 3-2 anyway, and why you almost never see it run. 




 You did write it in an odd, kinda confusing way. To be fair. 




 Perry Ellis, called consistent. Literally never thought I would see or hear that.

EDIT: Why is this being downvoted again? He was crazy inconsistent for a long time. 




 They go to the NBA last year, they already got paid and they'll continue to get paid while they rehab and/or work on their game while riding the bench.

They could just as easily have gotten hurt this year. More easily probably, considering they played way more minutes at UK than they would've in the league. 




 He got a concussion. 




 Not to be a dick, but since we're talking about words and all...

hijacked* 




 Yes you are 




 There are arguments to be had both ways, and honestly, both sides have merit. Whatever ends up happening will have people claiming confirmation of one side over the other. The best answer is we don't know, but they certainly could have done a lot worse, and there's not many people who would've been better hires. 




 I get the reasons why it would happen, it's still bananas that they have a winning record in the second round even though most of the time they're playing a 4 seed. 




 Florida lost a lot but brought back a good bit too.

On paper Maryland looks real good next year. We'll see how it shakes out 




 Florida was preseason top 10 this year and finished below .500. He's saying it doesn't mean shit. Although KenPom disagrees. 




 Yeah I see why you used the numbers you did. I didn't even think about the S-curve there, although you're right. Bracketing principles usually keep it from being totally implemented though, don't they?

Wow, 16-15? That's crazy that 12 seeds have a winning record in the second round. 




 I'd argue the 12 or 13 has just as good of a path, if not a better one, seed wise, in the first weekend at least. 




 Didn't see Delon Wright for a second and got confused. 


Super happy Jerian Grant made first-team, he deserves it. 




 Jeez a 3 seed? For a team that lost twice in a major conference? 

Debate how you will about the ACC vs. Big East. I think the ACC is definitely better; that much better I don't think I'd agree with.

We can agree to disagree about being impressed with Nova. It's quite possible that you and I just watched them on different days and saw different things. Your opinion was certainly vindicated as much as it can be in a single-elimination tournament. I just stand by the reasoning that NC State is an extremely talented basketball team who can beat anyone when playing well, Villanova played awful, and they still almost won the game. 




 NC State deserving to win and Nova being overrated are two entirely different things.

You guys have an incredibly talented but inconsistent basketball team, one that beat Duke earlier this year. Villanova played their worst game of the season. 

You guys won by 3.. 




 I didn't want to like that but I did because it's so damn true 




 It's been realllllly sloppy. But intense, sure 




 That one's a good possibility. But the chances of everyone rolling through the first weekend without playing a close game are slim. 




 At least someone will have a close game, it's almost guaranteed 




 You guys will be in the conversation next year. Beau Beech is awesome 




 Honestly most people would've been pretty OK with switching your team and Dayton. 




 HEY BRACKET, NONE OF US ARE EVEN CLOSE TO HAVING YOU FILLED IN RIGHT, WHICH IS WAY LESS THAN I CAN SAY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER 




 Sorry man :( 




 Hampton coach, Hampton 




 That was the only game of that tournament UConn deserved to lose. 




 I seriously doubt it, given the level of discourse at ESPN sometimes.

It would be an awesome thing though. 




 Yeah, I found myself making the assumption that it couldn't be Dawkins because of the K connection, but it's all I can really see.
 




 It seems like the institutional resources would be there if you guys can put it together though. 




 Sooo, Stanford? 




 That's what I was saying haha. I don't see OSU being able to pull it off at all. The only reason I gave them any shot is because it's March, and I've put my foot in my mouth enough times. If they're gonna do it, that's what needs to happen: Amir Williams playing like a man possessed, and Russell going off. Chances of that? Slim at best. 




 Cool, good analysis

EDIT: I'm more than happy to have a conversation, and there's a great chance I'm wrong about a lot of things, but that's just a dumb comment. 




 Some of these whistles are straight ridiculous haha. 




 Tustin. I feel like I remember playing you guys once or twice 




 Hoping they realize lots of people are watching and take steps to correct it. 




 Dee Dee, get out of my lah-bore-ah-tore-e!

Omelet du fromageeeeeee 




 Yeppp hahah. I mean I went to Tustin, we were solid at that time but we weren't a serious contender.  




 Seriously no clue haha. 




 Amir Williams would need the game of his life, and Arizona would have to be ice cold from the field. Also I'm just assuming that anyone who picks Ohio State to win a game is assuming Russell will drop at least 25 in that game. 




 I think he was going for Cyclone but that was my first thought too lol 




 It amazes me that you have Michigan State and ND in the Final Four and only put up an 847. 




 I know that feel, we played Kawhi Leonard when he was in high school. Destroyed us. 




 They had their best player, 7 footer Robert Upshaw with NBA talent, kicked off the team in December and then nosedived into badness.

Saying they played a bunch of crappy teams and nosedived is just not knowing what happened this year at all. 




  if they aren't playing well, they can easily lose early.

I'd hope that goes without saying.. 




 Those games are 50/50. I wouldn't beat yourself up over it too much, pick the teams you like best. I have three 9s and an 8, but realistically, any of those teams can win. None of them are horrible match-ups for the other, and none of them are over or under seeded too much. 




 I have them in the Elite 8. It's not an easy road at all, but they have the best player in the regional in Kris Dunn. That's a damn useful thing 




 You mean Sweet 16? They're on the same side of the regional, they have to play before then. 




 Indeed, thanks! This is probably the thing I'll be most excited about today until the tournament starts hahaha 




 Just my thoughts haha. Look, gun to my head, I'm taking Kentucky. But those two things make Wisconsin a very tough team. That's essentially them firing on all cylinders. 




 And your 7'6" center 




 I'm not really buying the haven't faced an elite team deal. 

Wisconsin has played one elite team, Duke, who they lost to at home in a great game. 

Kentucky has played one elite team, Kansas, who they eviscerated before Kansas had really figured out how to play together. 

Virginia lost to Duke at home in a great game. 

Duke won at Virginia and at Wisconsin, easily the best two wins this season, but also lost to/played close games against teams much their inferior. 

Arizona played one, a home win against Gonzaga in OT. Gonzaga obviously played the same one.

Each of these teams, with the exception of Duke, has 1 elite game. Which half of them lost. Why does that all the sudden make them head and shoulders above Villanova? 




 They're not terrible. I don't think you guys will lose to them. But they're not terrible. 




 Fox is pushing that angle because they want to raise the value of their properties (the Big East). If everyone thinks it's a joke, no one will bother heading to FS1 to watch it. So when ESPN says the Big East is overrated, Fox needs to push back with why they would say that. 




 Oh I don't think they will beat you. They just absolutely have the talent to do so. 




 So is his last name really pronounced Toke-O-Toe like Jay Bilas and the rest of ESPN says it? I have a visceral reaction to it every time, cuz I feel like it should be pronounced Toko-Doe...

these are the things I think about 




 If Duje plays like that in the tournament and Traevon comes back and plays effectively, I might even favor you over Kentucky. Maybe. 




 It's a tough regional, but they're definitely talented enough to do it. They can match-up with anyone in the region too. 




 Both offensive juggernauts, but Gonzaga has size in a way Iowa State can't really match, would be my quick take. But Iowa State has a way of getting on these unstoppable runs. Depends what you trust. 




 Just walk around in between games and you're golden
