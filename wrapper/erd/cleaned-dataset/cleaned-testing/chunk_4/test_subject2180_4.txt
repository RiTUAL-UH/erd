 But he's not helping everyone but the muslims, he's not helping anyone but christians because those are the people who helped him. His efforts are focused on providing people who saved his life relief. Jesus he's not well jesus, he can only do so much. He's like 90, he's not saying oh f muslims they will be fine on their own, he's stating he is trying to help those he can with his current abilities.  




 Does anyone have the bank meme showing clearly that of the top 5 banks in the world asians run 3 of them? in not a single jew runs one.  




 Wow the utter level of antisemitism on this thread.   




 MODS REMOVE THIS HEATHEN NOW 




 Anyone who mention's lil Wayne as a a good example of hip hop kill yourself.  









 No............

Yes ok i searched for two minutes and ran to reddit. I'm a fucking addict for this site man, do you not understand this, it's hard so fucking hard. I need to post. Forgive me.  




 No i started researching what they stated. Only found strawman arguments and biased sites then came here.  




 I am lazy and fat. Don't come and trigger me bitchboy. In no i don't think veganism is hard, i do think it's annoying when people use hyperbole to debate subjects.  




 True but it's better to use reddit. Plus much more informative, then a dry read, if i wanted to read a wiki i would of done it myself.  




 If anything i'm trying to enlighten myself. Your answer however is nothing more then outright rudeness. 
 














 "You may have not have had a chance to read my edit on the previous post, but I will mention it again here. If you have the legal right to do something, you don't need to petition a court to carry it out." Once again that's not how it works, seceding is not legal right framed into the constitution, that's why if you reread my post you see my clearly pointing out they would have a very good legal case to argue they can secede from the union. It's not inherent. 

"And, second, if the Court miraculously sided with the South, the North was now in a political pickle that would undermine their ability to deny the South's legitimacy." Now you're getting it. The right of secession being fought in the courts would of been a nightmare scenario for the union, Lincoln was extremely lucky the question was settled on the battlefield instead of court. Which brings me back to how heavily the south fucked up by going the war route instead of holding fire.

Nope midwest. In you would be correct if fort sumter was a hostile entity, look at the placement of the fort, being under threat of cannon's would be a reality if a war had already begun, like you stated previously it did not kick off until 61. If fort sumter was a threat to shipping which they were not i could agree but they were not firing upon any ships. All ships coming into port would be commercial vessels or foreign only confederate naval vessels the few that did exist would possibly be faced with fire in this is only later in the war.

 Yes because ol lincoln is the king of the us and he has the god ordained ability to force the supreme court to keep the union intact. Do southerners not understand the 3 branches or what? regardless of what lincoln believed or not if this went to the supreme court in the south was in the right his protest would be null and void.

The forts were voluntarily surrendered because either they were housed by confederates/southern sympathizers or not given direct orders to hold the fort. Once again just because you declare an intent to secede does not make it so, they did not dissolve the union. The civil war was the deciding factor in rather or not the union would be dissolved, you seem to believe if someone declares something it is automatically law.

Link some info on how it threatened shipping lanes. You mean they were in effect blockading and besieging a federal fort from resupply? how is that peaceful?! he told them they were coming so they would not be stupid and fire upon the ships. That's the exact opposite of invading that shows he clearly did not want them to misconstrue relief as invasion. 


In god i need breakfast lmao that last post ugh wtf anyway um once again the question of rather or not they were sovereign was a constitutional issue not a inherent right. They had the right to take it to the supreme court not secede in begin seizing federal territory.   




 That's cute. Jennifer Lawrence, heroic lead role of one of the biggest franchises in cinema to date. Gets paid more then Chris pratt now explain to me why does this exist? because it's about the box office that's all that matters in Hollywood. Point to a single case where a woman makes less then a man in Hollywood? you don't because salaries are not even published unless they choose to release the info. Being a actor is not a set pay scale, theirs no way to determine or make a report on wage gap since they do not get wages god how can people be this stupid. 

Furthermore we do not know what she got paid for american hustle, you're referring to "point" she got 7 compared to christian bale's, renners and other's 9 points. This is intellectually dishonest to say she got paid less because she has a pussy in they have a penis. First, Lawrence had a minor, supporting role in American Hustle. This is just a fact. Cooper has the Hangover Series, among other hits, which hold the #1 and 2 spot on the highest grossing comedies of all time. Between them, they probably have over $4 billion in box office hits and are big, international draws. The contract for this film was probably made in 2012 or early 2013, which was just after Renner's The Avengers and during which time Lawrence only had the first Hunger Games under her big box office belt. 
A lot of Renner's scenes were cut, including the original final scene.  He was originally a much more central figure, and the only really sympathetic character. His part was as big as Bale's and Cooper's in the shooting script, I believe. None of Lawrence's stuff got cut, I don't think, which is why she feels so big in the movie, but she's definitely more of a supporting roll.  It became clear that the Amy Adams storyline would be the central focus, and that Renner would be more of a supporting role (as he is a real person and a lot of his stuff was expository).  Cooper's role increased as a result of the plot shifting to Adams and Bale more exclusively (he's essential to that part of the story). Then the rest of his scenes with Louis CK had no chance of being cut. I believe most of the original Renner scenes were with Bale (whose part was also slightly smaller than originally intended, though he drives the narrative).  Also, David O. Russell really wants Renner to be seen on the level of Bale and Cooper which is probably why david o russel was pushing to get him a equal 9 points with bale and cooper, and his chops and creds merit that. 

Oh 9 out of ten best actors in the last few years were men? SO????! should we start paying actors and actress the same amount because of their genitals, you sound like the people who complained when selma did not get nominated for the academy. Just because you make oscar bait and did not catch fish does not make the entire academy the equivalent to the kkk, adam sandler made 49 million because his movies are extremely profitable and because he owns the production company.

That's how he gets 49 million, think of it like call of duty. Same game every year but it makes a billion easily, why is this? it's utter repetitive crap, but guess what people buy cod and play the crap out of it. Yes they're infinitely better video game franchises but they don't have as much mainstream appeal. Hollywood is the height of this business model, if actor A brings in 700 million just because his name is in the credits and actor b only brings in 500 million and then actor c has 30 years of work, is an Oscar winner and has been nominated 30 times who do you think i will pay more? the guy who is bringing in 700 million.

Hollywood comes down to knowing what you're worth, a great example of this is charlize theron who was livid when she found out she was not making as much as co-star and told the studio she wanted the same, in guess what? they gave it to her. If you're worth 20 million dollar in 9 bloody points then call your agent up and tell them you're not filming a single scene until you get that.

It's not rocket science... oh wait i forgot according to feminist and pao women are inferior hagglers, due to their "delicate" sensibilities so they cannot properly argue for their worth or value to a prospective employer. Damned patriarchy. It's sad that all these female actresses will never be on equal footing with male costars because theirs no such thing as idk agents who negotiate your contract? 




 No at best it's purposefully being misleading. That's not how it works, seceding from the union would be a constitutional and rather or not it is granted in said constitution. Declaring independence and taking over federal property/territory(remember just because it sat in the midst of south Carolina does not make it their territory) if texas seceded all of those military bases are still us army and the army would have every right to refuse to hand them over. Once again this comes back to south Carolina and the confederacy jumping the gun on a legal dispute. 

Now you're just being nonsensical and ignoring the law of cause and effect. The south declare it's intent to secede, took steps to do this, you already pointed out they had begun taking other federal forts and was going to take this one, that's not preventing or attempting to prevent invasion that's outright seizing territory that does not rightfully belong to you. By firing on this fort you're effectively invading union territory. 

Furthermore the confederates states had no right to order any federal installation to surrender their arms. Unless the fort actively blockaded and obstructed the shipping lanes directly harming the confederacy you're using hyperbole to justify a hostile action. In we're back to speculation once again, this is why you will never win any debate, baseless speculation on what if's is not a valid argument.

In that's not how it works, you fire upon me or my person i have the full and unequivocal right to defend myself to the best of my abilities, the best case of this is with Israel, regardless of rather or not Palestinians fired munitions cause damage or casualties you're still firing upon them. Lincoln was justified in burning the south to the ground and Sherman almost did following the siege of fort Sumter. The south started the war they could of ended with one court battle. 

 




 First that's a lie. If the south had tried to leave in peace they might have actually had a chance, the right to secede goes back to the original 13 states when they ratified the constitution. At the 1787 Constitutional Convention a proposal was made to allow the federal government to suppress a seceding state. James Madison, the acknowledged father of our Constitution, rejected it, saying: A Union of the States containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound.


The ratification documents of Virginia, New York and Rhode Island explicitly said that they held the right to resume powers delegated, should the federal government become abusive of those powers. The Constitution would have never been ratified if states thought that they could not maintain their sovereignty.

In other-words had the south not jumped the gun literally and brought the case of secession to the supreme court they would have had a very good legal case based on the constitution itself to secede from the union. Instead they went to war, in the case of the legality of secession was settled when the union won the civil war.

That's not how it works, take the Ukraine situation, while crimea "voted" to join up and become apart of russia all Ukrainian weapons, ships and other state owned properties are still legally the property of ukraine. Had not the war in eastern ukraine broke out and even after it's conclusion russia shall be required to compensate or hand over the Ukrainian naval ships.

In once again this goes back to them choosing to fire on a federal fort, just because south carolina declares itself seceded does not nullify federal governments right any and all property located at said fort. They attempted to take a federal fort which under all laws is illegal and can be whittled down to a basic case of outright theft.

Furthermore you cannot invade your own territory, like i posted above the constitution provides the federal government any and all means to stop hostile elements foreign and domestic in support of the defense of the constitution. Had south Carolina allowed the resupply and went the legal route declaring this a invasion of their now sovereign territory and suing the federal government they would have had a much better chance in the long run.

Now you're going into what if scenario's but even if Lincoln was dead set on invading regardless the south legally would have been on a higher ground and the support for the war would be completely different. What the north and even slave owning states saw was domestic secessionist force hostile to the federal government fire upon federal territory instead of Lincoln being the big bad invader like the southerners like to postulate it showed the supposed defenders of their homes firing the first hostile shot turning a legal dispute into a outright war. Thank you for acknowledging this.

 




 The majority of southern people think the civil war was fought over states right and that this is the actual confederate flag not the battle flag. In otherwords people are stupid, it does not matter how you identify with a flag, the flags popularity and resurgence stems from racism and pro-segregation with a origin in the cause of slavery. I don't care if 40 years from now germans will identify the nazi swastika with pride in being german it is still a racist symbol so get over it.

it's not to extremes it's the most logical comparison if any. OMG this is your problem you have the same level of b.s in your ears, you do not seek independence by firing upon a federal fort and seizing it, which if you succeeded would be another countries property. The civil war was not about independence it was about keeping slavery, stop trying to glaze over this with nice words they wanted to keep slaves, the states that succeeded announced this clearly.

That's why the secessionist movement even exist, that's why the flag exist and that's what it comes down to. Both were immoral movements, the only difference is grant being a drunk allowed the south to get federal troops removed when we should of stayed and made sure the next generation grew up not knowing their fathers and grandfathers were wrong and taught this. Instead it's been over a century in we're still dealing with the same old bull because southerners can't admit their ancestors started the bloodiest war in american history to own black people and then have the audacity to tell black people to let go of the "race card" like seriously how hypocritical and ignorant can you be. This comes down to nothing more then the fact like with japan white washing their atrocities you have a generation who either does not know or outright supports these war criminals, the only difference is southerners call this pride. If only we had not allowed history to be whitewashed. 




 Seriously i don't get where all this hate is coming from. While i think his newer movies are crap, i grew up on water boy and click or trick or w.e that movie with the remote was also very good. Yes some of his films have bombed hard(not financially) but that does not explain where this idea of his career fading or him being hated comes from. Is this about the rose McGowan thing? goddamn matriarchy!!!! 




 AMERICAN HUSTLE WAS CRAP UTTER BORING CRAP.  




 Wow it's almost like you had a point. Oh remind me again about what interesting/complex films chris pratt or channing tatum has done to get better box office draw? it's hollywood. Remake central. if you want more complex films then become a writer, that's not sexism, hollywood is filled to the brim with crap reboots.

Edit: downvoted me all day, my point still stands. Hollywood comes down to whoever is hot or popular, women and men get paid on what they can bring the studios, the idea of a wage gap in hollywood is hilarious, if you want more or equal money to somebody like jennifer lawrence or leo dicaprio then make the studio money otherwise shut up. Women get less lead roles yet sandra bullock made 135 million last year compared to robert downey jr's 75 million 




 Wtf are you talking about. That's exactly how it works RBJ went from like 500,000 thousand in iron man to 20 million in the sequel. It correlates to box office earning, if you bring in people you get paid more. No matter how many box offices you have if you start slumping then you lose that amount.

 Agent orange fucked our soldiers over more then Vietnamese i believe. In the government still refuses to acknowledge this, sorry not stating they did not suffer but i have not heard any complaints about Vietnamese mad about it, can you link information on this?  




 True, trail of tears is the most egregious example of this. But theirs a difference between outright genocide(think of australia with the aborigine's) versus ethnic cleansing. Theirs no doubt the colonials were trying to get rid of indians but outright genocide them is not correct on any level, they broke every treaty they ever made with the native tribes and confederacies but if they wanted to exterminate them outright they would have just kept shooting in damn making a treaty. 

Natives got screwed over long before the colonist arrived, with the germs that traveled up from south america, ever looked up the civilization of north america pre- colonialism? the death from germs was catastrophic and decimated what we now believe to be 90% of the population, had not this occurred the colonialist would of been crushed due to sheer numbers, one of the explorers of early america sailed around the coast of the eastern now what we know as the us and said he saw bonfires across the entire length the eastern coast. The white man did not fight 300 years with the natives because they did not outright want to exterminate them(because they also did not want that) but it took 300 years just to beat them and even then they had to force them unto reservations at the point of artillery guns. 




 Congress apologized and paid restitution in the 1980's. Furthermore japanese americans served in the army during ww2 and one of their units is the most highly decorated unit in american history. While i'm sure theirs people still annoyed by it i thought any of the older generation of japanese americans feel negative towards the us flag.  




 Theirs a mcdonalds in the former capital of south vietnam. Peace has been made on all fronts in vietnam. I've never heard of a pissed off Vietnamese still mad about the war. Never stated we were a glowing beacon of admiration but american culture most definately is, for every terrorist in iraq who says death to america theirs a dozen listening to the newest pop hit from an american artist and visiting nyc. That's something bastions of imperialism in the past failed to due, where we rub people politically the wrong way, culturally we make up for.  




 Honestly do they have memorials to nazi's? lets remove these confederate memorials to.  




 This is semantic bullshit. I can use the same argument, to the jews the nazi swastika is  symbol of genocidal hatred of them and their entire people. To a neo nazi or german "nationalist" it's a symbol of their pride of being german, of their ancestors who fought to for their homeland of the innovations and technological leaps due to germans. You can't just say muh pride is in this flag, it's still a racist symbol despite how you try to argue people see different meaning in symbols. So do nazi's does not mean you will ever fly the nazi flag over germany again. 




 Um did you get this off of russia today? 




 I understand your post but this comes from ignorance. THE FLAG WAS POPULARIZED BY THE KKK, IT WAS A REACTION TO CIVIL RIGHTS lynyrd skynyrd and dukes of hazard came after the fact it had already been in usage for decades to support racism. This is the equivalent if a celeb tried to redeem a swastika because of it's ancient and peaceful heritage, but it just does not work. Southern pride should not be a symbol of segregation, racism or treachery to your country, this only occurred because we allowed the south to continue on their same ignorant path post reconstruction and we continue to fail to educate the younger generations about the history of these symbols. 




 Southern pride is racist if you base it on the concept of pride in the confederacy and your rebellious slave owning ancestors with your symbol being a flag popularized by the kkk. 




 Because idiot. One not the same flag in actuality. We changed it, the us flag is not the same flag that flew while we were expanding into manifest destiny and secondly horrible oppression of native americans has never been a qualification or ideal of being an american.  




 Vietnam has made peace with the us. Japan is an ally and they were in the wrong during ww2, middle-eastern people? like who? only isis and pro isis sunni's got screwed over when saddam fail. 




 Incorrect the near genocide was the result of the germs. We spent 300 years fighting a war against various tribes not outright genocide but plenty of ethnic cleansing and massacres. Sorry had to clarify this and i'm part black foot indian(no not some bullshit 1/38th my great grandfather was black foot chieftain)
