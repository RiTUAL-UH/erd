  Except that none of those are requirements except in that you want them.
 You can starve to death, dehydrate, or freeze. You choose not to, because those things suck. But that does not make it anything less than a choice both in that moment and in the aggregate.
 You don't have to have a job, you want one because the alternatives suck. You don't have to take this particular job, or keep it even when you dislike it, your alternatives just suck.
 But trying to morph the fact that you don't like your choices into something meaning "I don't have a choice" is bullshit. You always have a choice.

Looking at the big picture we are slaves to those more powerful than us, to those who are providing our needs in exchange for money which we have to work for. These governments and private corperations have taken the power to produce they have taken the resources they have grown to become huge and take up all the space and by "space" I mean power distribution, the lower you are in the socio economic spectrum the more enslaved you are because to get your needs you need to be a slave to those above you. To sum it up, the governments and ruling class have taken the power and the resources and will give you some in exchange for your own enslavement. Sure you can make your own home and grow your own food  (Although very difficult) but keep in mind that they have the power and are in control, they c

Think of this analogy, organism blue is in a room with resources, organism blue takes the resources and hides them, organism blue learns to mass produce resources and keeps them all too himself, Organism blue has an offspring and dies. The offspring now inherits his resources and power to create. Organism orange is introduced to the room, organism blue proposes to orange that he will give him resources to live and also the hope of maybe one day inheriting this power and great amount of resources in exchange for orange helping blue mass produce and grow more powerful so it's orange's survival and a bit of liberty for his time effort, keep in mind "survival". Now compare this to slavery, a slave is told "help us or we'll leave you to die here in the desert." My alternative is a society where everyone contributes, and there doesn't have to be a ruling class or if there is at least not corrupt and not in all control, this way we can all contribute and we can still make scientific breakthroughs, space exploration, etc it seems much better to the current state of capitalism.

Addressing specifically what you said: you can say the same thing to a slave and try to convince him he is free, try it, say it in your head to one of those african slaves in the US in the 1800's he can starve to death, but he chooses not to because the masters give him the tiny liberty of choosing not to, he doesn't want to be a slave but his alternatives suck as well, therefore we have some choice but it doesn't change the fact that capitalism is slavery like I originally stated you are stating anything that can change my view in a valid way.

The key: If a slave is given some choice it does not necessarily mean that he is not a slave

 can you please teach me the basics then? 




 yeah 




 it's a method to protect the glans and de-keritanize it again 




 what does this do? do you put money in, gain interest and then wait until you retire to use it? why is it different from a normal savings account 




   A life without this value brought about by an end isnt better than one without an end.

What do you mean, I think a life that never ends might be better
 




 Are problems the problem? We can overcome almost anything though, and what about the good times? 









 CHEAP FOOD ADVICE (so i can come back to this later)

 I've been getting urinary tract infection like symptoms

- pain when urinating quickly (I suspect it's from old dried up semen)
the first drop causes a sharp pain inside the penis, if i urinate quickly it hurts more and will sting for a long time, if I go slowly it only hurts a little

- after urination I will have a burning sensation and after ejaculation i would have a very dry drained feeling inside the penis area, maybe inside the tube it feels very uncomfortable,

- after urination I will feel like I still need to pee, and drops of urine will come out one by one slowly for up to 10 minutes or even more sometimes even 45 minutes

- streams would sometimes be bulky and go all over the place, like a spray or double stream I would also have slow streams a lot

i'm 18 years old and a male from australia, seen several doctors which done urine and blood tests, nothing showed up, saw a urologist even got an ultrasound of internal organs.

 The fact that it ends and we know it and it's an eternal void of nothingness we try to find something to hold onto in the meantime nihilism seems good but then you know you have to let go of nihilism and take it RAW

 Yeah this whole week was absolute shit this is how i've been feeling

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfDVLsBXYcM

fucking hell man fucking life...

Hope superpowers won't go away
 




 I was feeling a bit horny and needed to replace the saran wrap on my glans (restoring sensitivity for circumcised guys) when i felt a little "pop". A drop of liquid went out of my penis and i felt a mini orgasm. I started to get warm and for the next 30 seconds my heart started beating fast, my breathing got faster and it felt like i was having a mini orgasm for 20 seconds. Followed by a built up in release, i then orgasmed and ejaculated. Fucking hell 31 day streak i feel like crying and crawling up into a hole. I had plans and this was the perfect moment of my life to be successful at nofap. I know it doesn't count as a reset but personally i think i lose "super powers" after an orgasm

I can't describe what emotions I am feeling now but damn my life is truly a disappointing one 




 day 7-33 have been too easy for me in the past it was an unbeatable battle but now it's nothing

 Mostly paleo, cutting back on carbohydrates big time, focusing on calorie restriction and eating less in general




-
[Much like this](http://documentaryheaven.com/eat-fast-and-live-longer/)


-
exercise is moderate cardio (3 days a week) with a lot of walking and standing (standing desk) very little sitting

-

some moderate weight exercises 3 days a week

coffee and red wine occasionally
hopefully moderate socializing
walking in  nature 

**My big concern is the reduction of carbohydrates, calories and eating in general**


*Can someone give me some ideas and theories as to what are the pros and cons and hopefully speak in neuroscientific and biological ways?* 




 specifically neurologically and biologically 









 Also worrying about other things like idea theft and patents

How can one actually get around to working on the idea? Is there a way to just sell my idea? 




 I'm not even close to a relapse 

did you read this?

I'm not about to relapse, i'm just saying that I wish I had the teenage boy like urge to go after women
btw
i've been covering my junk with saran wrap to restore sensitivity in the glans because of circumcision, you think blocking of the meatus could make someone unintentionally successful at nofap because it is blocking the path of least resistance, the person wouldn't have to overcome and grow over their urges either so that might be bad?

 feel the same day 31 and i am not feeling amazing 




 If having sex with a girl was heaven and fapping was average then I would be motivated, help i'm confused and lost 




 In the past when I made it to day 10 I felt what everyone described, the superpowers, the energy, the feeling of being awake and alive.


Reached 31 days today and don't feel different at all. I think I found the problem. I have made myself completely asexual. My mind seems to believe that I have gone asexual rather than quitting masturbation or porn, today when I thought about fapping an intuition came from my mind like fapping is a "Disease" I maybe accidentally oppressed myself or it could possibly be some sort of flat line. from day 7-31 it has been effortless I didn't really have to try.


 I'm not really leaving the option of sexual activities with women open to myself because I feel like some or whatever superpowers I have will go away if I ejaculate or orgasm.


 I don't know what I am doing wrong, my past streaks that used to make it to 10 days each on average would make life a 10/10 but this streak of 31 has taken my life from the usual 3/10 to a 3.2/10 




 *You look extra pretty today* 




 O-O I don't see what's wrong with that statement? 




 1. Set up a huge goal that will help your life in the long run.
2. Go for the goal and try your best to achieve it, rationaliaztions, distrations and denial will appear and sway you off the track at times, analyse them and try and overcome them, discover your weaknesses and try and get stronger.
3. ???
4. PROFIT
