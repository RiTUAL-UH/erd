 My opinion of SeaWorld has changed from one of admiration to one of severe displeasure over the past decade.  That being said, I also understand that as a business, their goal isn't conservation or education; it's to be successful (i.e., make money).  I would just greatly prefer if their business model would change to one that doesn't rely on such abnormal habitat and social conditions for the animals.  Although, as someone who studies animals and not business, I have no idea if that's feasible. 




 You're right.  That chart was made by a person that was actually arguing for captivity, so I was under the impression the person know what he/she was talking about.  [Here](http://24.media.tumblr.com/b3f555b5e519089e3b6992f5718d704e/tumblr_mhq38iFRXn1rmadmwo1_500.jpg) is a chart made by a person arguing against captivity (the first one I posted was supposed to be a rebuttal to this one).  Hopefully this one makes more sense. 




 I wish I had saved the pie chart I saw a couple months ago breaking down how much SeaWorld spends on conservation efforts compared to other things.  I can't remember the figures exactly, but it was an extremely small percentage compared to their profits.  And they often use "rescue" as a reason to get wild animals for their collection.  The park in San Diego often takes sea lions that get trapped in fishing gear, try to train them, keep the ones that are easy to work with and release these half trained, human acclimated animals back into the ocean to get caught in fishing gear again.

And their idea of education is telling people either complete lies (such as that orcas live longer in captivity) or really simple ecological principles (the use of countershading by a ton of different animals).

So they conserve and educate just enough to have their PR team make them sound like the Savior of our oceans.

I found the chart I was talking about!  You can't even see the conservation piece (between the green and red pieces).

From the source:
Roughly 0.065% of SeaWorlds annual revenue funds an entire years worth of conservation. To put that in perspective: Target gives 5% of their annual revenue to charity. That is 80 x more money than SeaWorld gives to conservation in the same amount of time.

 NMFS gets petitions like this on a routine basis, almost always from organizations that would profit directly from the delisting of a certain population.  I personally would support the delisting of any group (population or species) that does not need to be listed (i.e., shows an ability to adapt to new human-induced pressure and is at a self-sustaining population size), but I believe most cetaceans are a permanent fixture on the ESL for many reasons (including their slow growth rates, large habitat size, high trophic level, etc.).  Commenting on petitions such as these is definitely important, but I believe that even if the scientific data says the North Pacific population is discrete and thriving, the benefits of keeping them on the ELS would outweigh any possible benefit to the petitioning group. 




 This happened to me a couple weeks ago with a pack of Nature's Path Organic Knockoff Poptarts.  Now I'm lamenting the karma that could have been. :'(

 You're welcome!  I saw Blackfish the first day it came out in my city.  It was a pretty mild look into the life of Tilly, but I enjoyed it overall.  It's a great introduction into the darker side  of captivity.  I'd heard about or seen nearly everything in the movie before then since I've been interested in the topic for about as long as the director has and I think she covers a good amount of information in the 90 minutes she has to present it.  The only inaccuracy (possibly a lie, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt) is when the whale researcher says a wild whale has "never harmed a human."  In fact, there is one documented attack on a human (a surfer in California) in the 1970s that required [100 stitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans).  He survived, but I would consider that harming a human and I believe the researcher should have known about that attack.

The book [Death at SeaWorld by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/) paints a much more in depth portrait into Tilly's psyche.  The Cove is another good documentary into the captivity industry involving smaller cetaceans (mostly bottlenose dolphins).

SeaWorld is extremely good at PR and has been since the very beginning, so I don't think OP is a bad person for his or her viewpoint.  I understand your use of the word "brainwashed" in the context, but I try to believe that people who are fans of SeaWorld have put in the effort to weigh the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion than I have.  Many of the points I stated before about possible benefits are adequate, but also have stronger counterpoints in my opinion.  It's an extremely complex and emotionally-driven issue, since we can't determine how marine mammals think or feel.  We also can't quantify the benefits attained from any suffering experienced by the captive animals.  The past 40 years have definitely opened a scientific window into the world of marine mammal biology, but I would argue animals owned by corporations are no longer useful for any scientific development.  There are labs around the world that study marine mammal physiology using captive animals that live at the labs, but places like SeaWorld seem to only publish/present information on animal husbandry and breeding, which is only beneficial for their interests of keeping animals captive and sustaining a breeding population for multiple generations, with only a marginal percentage of their profits going to conservation and research.

Overall, I personally would argue against keeping marine mammals in captivity and I have a set of reasons that are unquantifiable and definitely driven by emotions, but other people would argue for captivity for another set of reasons that are just as unquantifiable and driven by emotions.  This is a heavy topic, but it's important to try to remember where people on each side are coming from and to realize that strong opinions come from a love and respect for the animals and that everyone wants what they think is best overall. 




 Adventure Club made a mix that contained a mashup of those two songs.  I hadn't heard the Bruno Mars song and only heard the Goyte song a couple times before and thought it was just one song until I looked at the track list. 

Edit: [Link to said mix!](https://soundcloud.com/adventureclubdubstep/superheroes-anonymous-vol-1)  Somebody That I Use To Know comes in around 4:30 and Locked Out of Heaven comes in around 6:50. 




 I'm sort of late to the game on this post, but I'm bored so I searched "SeaWorld" on here to see what showed up.  Hopefully I can help out with your question.  I'll preface my answer my saying I spent a good portion of my childhood and early teens at SeaWorld (last time I went was maybe around '07 or '08), but as I've gotten older I've developed a pretty anticaptivity stance based on the information I've come across, particularly after the death of Dawn the trainer in 2010.  Also, I'm on mobile, so bare with me as I can't look back at either your or OP's comment, so I'll try to remember everything. 

I believe OP is referring to programs such as summer camps, visiting schools, school field trips, internships, etc. when (s)he is talking about education.  I took summer camps there every summer for about a decade, when were definitely fun as a kid, but the actual animal knowledge gained from the experience was probably equivalent to a BBC documentary.  The focus was more on how the workers take care of the animals.  Therefore, I would argue that, at least in my experience with the summer camps, it's more of a recruiting/propaganda tool (Note: I'm not insisting that this is a bad thing, I believe that if the animals are there, the trainers better be the best and brightest available).  Although, the mystique and celebrity status of being a SeaWorld trainer makes the jobs veey competitive, which means the company can give trainers low pay and terrible benefits because they know that for every 1 person that quits, 100 would be willing to take the job.  I guess what I'm saying is that yes, there is an educational aspect, but it's very minimal.  Oh, and the company feeds workers false info to tell patrons regarding the negative aspects of captivity.

Next point is "awareness" I think.  I'm sure that some people are unaware of these animals, but I don't think that SeaWorld is the only avenue for them to learn. In the Internet Age, we can learn a ton about all the animals at SeaWorld.  The only thing SeaWorld provides on this front is a hands-on or close-proximity experience.  These are awesome.  It's amazing to be that close to these mysterious creatures.  The only questions is whether or not you personally think it's worth it for the animals.  I don't, but others do and that's okay.  This is aa complex issue with many opinions. 

Conservation is often times tied in with awareness by procaptivity people, but how many people do you think change their lifestyle just because they went to SeaWorld?  I'd guess not very many.  Plus SeaWorld San Diegovhas gotten in trouble for dumping chemicals into Mission Bay on multiple occasions, so there's that too.

OP brought up rescuing and releasing animals.  The fact of the matter is they use this more as a way to get new animals more than anything.  They find hurt/isolated/nuisance animals, try to acclimate them to captivity, keep the ones that take to it well (even if healthy again), and release the ones that aren't good once those are healthy.  The issue here is the released animals are then used to being around people and are likely to end up in a vulnerable position again.  They don't release high profit animals such as whales, the notable exception being J.J. the juvenile gray whale, but that's because there is no tank large enough to hold an adult.  In fact, SeaWorld wanting nothing to do with the rescue effort at first, but after other groups agreed to foot the bill, they obliged to house it after others caught it.  Only a very small portion of profits go towards rescues, so I look at it as more of a PR move than anything.  Also, you are incorrect about SeaWorld rescuing orcas.  All of SeaWorld's wild orcas were caught by teams of boats and divers.  SeaWorld workers say they were rescued, so I don't blame you for not knowing that.  The only whale that might fall into the rescue category is Morgan, who was an orphan found in the Netherlands in 2011.  An aquarium there took her in and the law there says she had to be released when she was healthy, but they sold her to a park in the Canary Islands instead since that park has other orcas for Morgan to interact with.  After a long legal battle, in which the park presented evidence that Morgan was hard of hearing and couldn't be released, the court said they could keep her, but not profit off her.  Most people would take that to mean no shows.  Morgan still does shows.  Anyways,  before Morgan this Canary Islands park got 3 or 4 whales on a loan from SeaWorld.  I'm not sure about the contract wording, but SeaWorld has now laid claim on Morgan as theirs.  We'll have to see what happens on that front. 

Instead of looking at SeaWorld as a group of cruel people, I try to look at them as a business that uses animals as a commodity.  They try to maximize profits above all else.  It's in their interests to keep animals alive and performing, but happiness is not something they care about.  I understand everything they do from a business standpoint, but I do not think it's moral.

Sorry for the novel, but this is a complex issue and one that I care deeply about.  Hopefully it helps you get a grasp on it.  If you're interested in more info, feel free to pm me and I can try to get more in depth and set you up with links to do your own research.  




 That's very true.  It's highly unlikely that music at these events is loud enough to completely deafen the people or the animals.  However, concert speakers are huge and can register some extremely high dB.  Especially the kind that would be used in a large outdoor area such as a zoo.  Hopefully the speakers would be as far away from the animals as possible, but if not, exposure to loud, sustained noise can cause hearing sensitivity loss just the same as a person standing close to an extremely loud speaker.  These effects are even greater with low frequency bass sounds, which is prevalent in EDM music.  If it's not loud enough to cause any injury, it still has the potential to cause pain or discomfort.  I imagine it gets pretty stressful and annoying to the animals to have these events a couple times a year, even if they don't get injured as a result.
