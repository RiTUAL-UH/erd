 EDIT 2: When I clocked in for my shift my fellow IMs and I were taken to the HR meeting room, and were finally given full descriptions of our jobs and expectations, as well as an apology of sorts.
  I was not coached, in fact things that I had fought about in the past were corrected in my favor and things should be a little more straight forward than they were.

Thank you for all your responses and feedback!

Edit:  Thank you for your advise! I have sent in a ticket and will meet with my store manager tomorrow, hopefully it will turn out okay.

Tl;Dr: I told my asst. Manager he could not force me to stay past my scheduled time, he responded that he was going to hold me for job abandonment. He should have been back more often or assisted if he wanted everything off the ground, I told him "fuck you" and he responded with "well, fuck you too". End of story so far.

Extended Version:

When I first started, there were four other IMS employees I was working with, after a 8 months I have seen about ten different IMS come and go, for a long time I was the only one and for an even longer time there was just me and the guy I was hired with.
 I have never missed a shift, and I have never been late. They have never coached me, I do my job well and I am longest to have ever stayed in this position.

My scheduled clock in - clock out is 10 pm - 7 am. We are severely understaffed with 10 stockers and two backroom IMS, as well as a asst Manager and support Manager.
The management have a bad habit of making more work than we are able to work, and then it all needs to go back up to the top steel or binned. 
Then they don't show up enough to actually explain what everything is and what needs done with it, they expect me to direct traffic and do my job, and more.

Now after my scheduled time is up I get to decide whether I want to donate my personal time to help clean up the store, I had a assistant store manager when I first started who used to force us to stay, he even said, and I quote, "no, you can go when I say you can go." We stayed over two hours past scheduled clock out time because of that regularly back then. 

My current manager just tried to do that and the tl:dr sums up the rest.

Any advice on how to recover and cope with the upcoming problems, I am planning on talking to the new store owner about this really soon.

Thank you in advance. 




 Thank you for the quick response! I agree due to the additional XP drain when trying to level using Carrier/Helios. 




 However I cant seem to find any mention anywhere in the patch notes and I was wondering if this had been awhile ago or not... Thanks in advance!
