 Weren't there mutterings that this was an amazing script that got eaten alive by notes? I'm glad they salvaged something. 




 The closest videogame to a holodeck is, in my opinion, dwarf fortress. Shame it doesn't get much press. 




 Because the cities neighbor, Bludhaven, is even more shit. 




 He may not have had financial success, but Firefly, buffy and Angel were extremely good shows, and Serenity was a really great movie, with lots of nice directorial flourishes. It way outweighed stuff like Zathura, or even the first Iron man in terms of quality. I'm sure the new director will do a good job, but it won't be Edgar Wright quality. 




 But Joss whedon had already directed some really good stuff, in particular Firefly/serenity, moreover, John Favreau was never really as good of a director as Wright, who is probably one of the greatest mainstream directors to emerge in the last 20 years of cinema. 




 What might eventually happen is that it gets adapted into an anime TV series, seeing as the company that made the sequence are essentially the golden child of Japanese animation now, and the anime sequence was one of, if not the, best part. 




 Further confusing this is that Joss whedon apparently sent James Gunn's original script for GOTG back for 'not being James Gunn enough' 




 She-hulk being Bruce Banners cousin is basic comic book shit. Martian manhunter being hugely relevant to both the Justice League in the comics and in the animation is basic shit.  




 Kevin Feige actually knew barely anything about comics when he started as an exec, but he **learned** unlike Goyer. 




 This film will be weird. It's based on a spin-off of a spin-off of the x men, for crying out loud. 




 Don't worry buddy, I understood that reference. 




 Basically, the x men comics have a massive cast of loved characters and villains, around as many as the rest of the marvel universe alone. Rather than build up these individual characters, Ratner chose to include as many as he possibly could and ruin them all. For example, the Juggernaut is an entirely different character in the comics, and his appearance is equivalent to The hulk turning up in the avengers as a guy who can just turn green when he wants to. 




 I can almost guarantee that old man logan is the only she hulk story goyer has read, seeing as the only three writers that Hollywood respects are Moore, Miller and Millar. 




 I like how he apparently didn't realize she-hulk is meant to be the Hulk's  *cousin* 




 He also wrote a nick fury movie.... starring David Hasselhoff. 




 It's not even that goofy. The martian manhunter is actually a pretty badass title, and basically describes his job. 'Batman' sounds way more inherently goofy, but becomes not goofy due to *context,* which Goyer apparently doesn't understand. 




 Actually, all of the other people who filled the role of batgirl were more popular than Barbara, as Barbara never actually got her own comic as batgirl until 2011. (barbara is more well known as Oracle, although you might be referring to other media?) Cssandra cain in particular is a great fit for the arkhamverse, having a over 100 issue comic run, being a better fighter than batman, and being an intriguing character in her own right. 




 It really could be anyone, as there are so many characters/alliances/guilds that could facilitate such a character. Hell, for all we know it could be Cassandra or david cain. 




 A villain who fills the same niche as tonnes of other batman villains, hence the speculation it's Jason todd, heretic etc. 




 Justice

Yeah, it must be real difficult to decide a profession based on that name.

 Hey, is there a German dub of attack on titan? because isn't that the language the characters are heavily implied to speak in-universe? 




 This. I'm more than happy to read subs (although I read faster than normal, so don't have many issues) but sometimes dubs just fit the tone and theme of the series better, black lagoon being the most prominent. 




 I agree for the most part, but I really think the 'winter soldier' theme was nailed, those air raid siren really add menace to the character. 




 I'm sure the youtube community will just LOVE the ending. 




 Lewis voted for another player to win other than his arch nemesis, I don't get why people think that's being butt hurt rather than competitive. Duncan lost the game by not building for science, and, as is meant to be the flow of the game, other Civs ganged up and defeated him by voting for a neutral player. 




 You do realize that a diplomatic victory is a completely legitimate victory condition right? It could have happened anyway without Lewis's intervention if Rythian had actually worked for it, and Duncan should have been working to complete his science victory rather than investing in giant robots. Duncan lost the game, and Rythian won. Simple as. 




 MALMO REMEMBERS BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




 Black lagoon needs a dub to be watched properly, especially as everyone canonically speaks English in the series. 




 Sayaka from Madoka magica is best girl. Her best girl stat transcends time. 









 Hollywood: " Oh, we've learnt our lesson, we've hired a promising sci-fi writer by the name of Roberto Orci to direct the new big budget star trek!" 




 Oh, I'm by no means doubting that, however, I am curious what website you work for that still has a community that proclaims such blatantly false accusations, as women have been involved in the game blogging/reviewing industry since it's inception. 




 Lewis looks around his fallen empire, a single tear shedding from his eye. He looks at the Sky, his face contorted in rage, only able to utter a single, fearsome word:

"PYRION!"


"PYRION!"

and finally, inexorably, a final throe: "PYRIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNN!" 




 Actually, people thought Jim was trolling when he said dynasty warriors 8 for PC was unplayable. People do not trust Jim sterling. Period. 




 Spain says "SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKAS!!!!" 




 I'm pretty sure that skyfall, at least at one point, was meant to confirm that theory. I remember watching it in cinemas and thinking that Silva would be an ex James Bond, and it would be a big 50th anniversary twist. It was a real shame when the entire 3rd act went out of its way to disprove the theory though. 




 The book wasn't finished by the time the movie was being made, but Bryan Lee o malley had a lot of say in the original content. 




 I would recommend Lego marvel superheroes on that front, despite not having particularly great controls for flying, the amount of speed you can get whilst playing as say, Iron man is pretty incredible. 




 So I thought it would be interesting to see what peoples choices were for comicbooks when you take watchmen/v for vendetta/ batman out of the picture. 




 My mistake. I sincerely apologize. 




 Which of the three madoka universes though? 




 I find that hugely annoying in anime, it makes the singles really hard to buy legitimately. 




 It's no fun is it? 




 If you read the book, you'll find out exactly why Wiseau is the last person you ever want on your film set. Remember, the room is made with the *best takes* 




 I don't think safety will be the problem, It's the illusion of safety, the idea that you won't be able to swerve to avoid cars etc. That will stop people from buying, particularly as cars without hugely expensive computers running them will be cheaper. 




 The problem is, in self driving cars there's no element of agency. I just don't see why you would spend thousands of dollars to buy a vehicle you can't really control. 




 It's a niche product at best, yet everyone has to buy it for it to work properly. If you want to be in a car that you have absolutely zero control over, why not just take the train? 




 Actually, self driving cars have been in concept stages since the 70's. They're relatively easy to do, just have the car follow a signal along the road. The main reason they haven't been introduced yet is due to people wanted to be able to control their multi-thousand dollar 2 tonne death machine. 




 Ant man is too close to coming out. Edgar usually puts around 4 years into production of his movies, and I doubt he's familiar with power rangers. 




 I did. Without mods. Losing/failing is fun! 




 It's worth noting that Godzilla fights a monster in every movie since Godzilla vs King kong, so it's a staple of the genre, rather than a real plot twist. 




 Not recently. Scotland is looking increasingly pro-independence, and, as a liberal, I can't really be against them wanting to get the fuck away from the Tories. 




 Asexuality is **very** complicated. And barely covered in the media. 




 Try out 'all star superman,' hell, any frame of reference past the Richard Donner films shows that he's not a 'boyscout.' Clark Kent is superman, not the other way around, he's a regular guy that tries to remain as humble as possible when facing impossible odds, something the Snyder film missed. 




 Apparently, neither the writer nor director has seen NGE, and the movie was inspired more by 70/80's anime, but take that with a grain of salt. 




 In my personal opinion it just felt more like it kept getting beaten, but then escaping on technicalities or Dues ex machina. First the corps capture it, then it uses a unseen previously ability to escape in human form, and you expect their to be a actual human v human fight or chase, mixing up the action, but that doesn't appear. Then Erens team essentially defeat it again, only for it to use more superpowers to kill a team of highly trained professionals. (who all decide to run into it) Then it beats Eren in a fight, which takes forever (altrhough it did legitimately win that time), and then Levi defeats it AGAIN but it's still pointless and we're still, apparently meant to think it 'won' when it got it's ass kicked for the last few episodes. The last arc is much better IMO because the stakes are actually grounded, we know what the female titan can do, and it doesn't pull any powers out of it's ass. 




 Sorry about the spoiler thing, I couldn't get the spoiler tag to work so just left it vague. I honestly felt like it didn't remain compelling after the first capture, she's still running around in titan form, which we have seen be caught, and then it's just watching her *almost* get caught again and again. It's not moving the plot forward, it's just watching people fail for fairly contrived reasons. (particularly once Levi comes in) I actually really liked the arc after it, where it actually feels like an even fight, but for half the recon corps arc, I was personally bored. 




 A year or two ago I had a nostalgia binge, watching youtube video etc.  I remember that roaming robots (the company doing the live shows) bought the rights to the robot wars name, and, if I remember correctly, they were pitching it to companies. (although it obviously wasn't successful) It's probably up to the producers more than anything, as neither the BBC or Channel 5 treated it with any respect. I think it's pretty much a matter of time before someone organizes a twitter campaign or whatever. It was a stalwart of a LOT of peoples childhoods, and when they become celebrities.... 




 What? Was that meant to be a sentence? 




 I hated how protracted that sequence was. Once the female titan gets trapped the first time, she loses all threat and mystery. After that it's just waiting for the inevitable to happen. 




 I hope the next movie focuses on sayaka, it would be really neat to explore her character after the changes in rebellion. 




 Yeah, they're really trying to get the rights to a TV show back. I think in today's climate, an optimistic, no bullshit *engineering* competition would be insanely cool. Think about all the new technology can be used to smash stuff! 




 I have the feeling in time started as a good script, but focus groups and producers sucked all the life out of it. 




 Bit of an unusual choice, but try out the three madoka magica movies. They're very japanese, but probably the darkest 12A movies aside from grave of the fireflies. They're actually some of my favorite films of all time, and well worth a watch even if you don't cry. 




 wow, went to robot wars when I was 5 as well! You know they still have robot tournaments across the country? 




 I would say the rock actually has very weak pulling power, roughly the same as vin diesel. People enjoy seeing him in a movie, but they won't go to a movie just for him. 




 It might be the spirit level terrible. Frank Miller pulling a good script out of the bag would be a pretty major fluke. And machete kills/spy kids 4 were massively critically panned. 




 I'm really backing GOTG to do well. Seems a much better idea for a summer family film than TMNT 




 Sin city, from the directors of Spy kids 4 and The spirit! It will certainly be interesting to see whether both Frank miller and Robert Rodriguez can actually turn their careers around. 




 That's an interesting point. Gaurdians of the galaxy has a draw far superior to TMNT, but aims at the same audience in multiple ways. It will also be the superior sci-fi film. (barring a disaster) Given the option of seeing TMNT or guardians of the galaxy, GOTG will win 99 times out of 100. 




 In the UK, pretty much everyone is a Sherlock fan, so it certainly sold well over here. The hobbit is also a damn well made movie, and almost certainly has more care put into than TMNT. 




 You don't seem to be able to understand that the new Godzilla movie has all the trappings of being a good movie, whereas the nearly 15 year old Roland Emmerich  movie had all the trappings of being shit. Are you really saying that the trailers/clips for the new Godzilla movie look like a 'bullshit monster movie with a shit story?' 




 Sci-fi/fantasy films need to be **good** (or at least not unbearably tedious)to really make traction in the box office, particularly if they're a new IP. Hercules seems to be aiming solely for a 3-star/2 star range, and, like prince of persia, it will fail. 




 It has a lot to do with how complex the swinging mechanics are, both from a coding and conceptual perspective. Things like momentum and building physics take a more concerted effort to recreate than almost everything else in the game. There's also the fact that Treyarch are just better devs than Beenox, of course they'll make a better game in the time than Beenox churning it out in time for the movie release.


There are lot's of old, great game mechanics that have been lost due to the industry cutting corners. Goldeneye and half life had a tonne of mechanics (such as shootable NPC's) that industry is too scared to use, because it might ruin their carefully crafted narratives. 




 It has a lot of interesting touches when you consider that, in-universe, the book would essentially become one of the most important books of all time, and it essentially is about the most famous celebrities of that era it would be the real world equivalent of a guy going round talking to The president, Steven Spielberg, and David Beckham, only as badass war heroes. 




 The POV character for that segment could easily be a film lead. It's subtle, but on re-reading I noticed that the character was involved in every major campaign of the zombie war, and was the only person to go from yonkers to the final battle. Max brooks was essentially interviewing (in universe) America's greatest war hero, but didn't introduce him as such because he assumed you would have already known about him. That's a pretty great idea for a film, in my opinion. 




 Yeah, that was meant to be a satellite that released the monster from hibernation, rather than the monster itself. 




 Monsters, director Gareth evens first foray into the genre, and if your willing to delve deeper into Japanese animation you have at minimum the series attack on Titan and neon genesis evangelion, as well as the upcoming (summer) Aldonoah. zero which promises to breathe even more life into the genre. 




 The movie is kind of lame in general if you're a sci-fi guy. IMO  it would be a much better film if it wasn't so embarrassed to embrace the tropes it rips off. Even though it's still a great film, it's redundant in the face of better written/ more crowd pleasing Massive monster affair. 




 From what I remember, that triggered the monsters release from hibernation or something. They didn't really have a predefined 'lore' so a lot of it is contradictory/red herrings, technically, they released a manga meant to clarify stuff, but that had a lot of supernatural elements (Clover was the ghost of a 14 year old or something)


The funny thing about cloverfield is that with the resurgence of Godzilla, pacific rim, and to a lesser extent things like attack on titan and EVA, the market for 'reinventions of the Kaiju genre' has pretty much dried up, so you really may as well view pacific rim as a sequel. 




 Eh, it will take quite a while to compile all the various sites/theories/magazine articles that I read years ago, but from what I remember, slusho (the company on logo's and T-Shirts throughout the film) having been drilling in the sea to try to find more of a 'secret ingredient' they put in their drinks, I don't believe it's ever specified, but at the bottom of a sea trench they find clover in a crack in the ground, so it lines up quite well with pacific rim. What is most important is that Cloverfield is essentially a generic kaiju movie, just told from an unconventional perspective, so it's as easy to say 'pacific rim and cloverfield take place in the same universe' as to say 'Godzilla and pacific rim are in the same universe' 




 Actually,  confirmed through the viral marketing that he did. Seriously. 




 An interesting note on the voice acting: The voice actor for Melia was Jenna Louise Coleman, A.K.A Doctor who's current assistant, before she was famous. 




 And then I just unzip it with winzip? Thank you for the help! 




 Sorry to ask, but which specifically should I download? Can you give a brief description of the sf/FT/CX stuff? 




 So, I know this has been already asked, but where is the best place to download Kill la kills sweet soundtrack? I unfortunately do not have the means to import the CD. Any links would be much appreciated, I would also like a potential simplification of the animex downloads page? What link should I click on? 




 Actually, DC built up a really large stock of female superheroes in the 90's/ 2000's, but they successfully managed to fuck them all up in the new 52. a birds of prey movie would kick ass. 




 In the 60's: The wasp/jean grey/ sue storm
In the 80's: essentially every character in the x-men
In the 90's: Most of the x-men, oracle starts to develop
2000's: almost every heroine written by Gail simone, particularly Batgirl and Black canary
Now: Marvels's pulled a lot of it back, with black widow and Ms marvel being popular. It's worth noting that most of these characters are actually more famous than Wonder woman in the comics community. I'm a big comics guy, and can tell you tonnes about every one of these characters EXCEPT wonder woman. 




 Geoff Johns was heavily involved with the green lantern movie.... yeah..... 




 Fargo: Sure, in America you'll get brutally, and senselessly, murdered, but at least we're chipper about it! 




 Hey Rythian, this may be off topic, but have you ever watched the anime madoka magica? It's similarly dark and emotionally crippling to this game. 




 Fucking Boddypen. 




 Nope, KLK is not suited for a videogame, the art style is too complex to be done with cel shading, not complex enough to be done with 3D models, not to mention a lot is done in a semi-warner bros style. The only way it could work is as a hand drawn 2D fighter or as a RPG. It's not suited for an action game. 




 47 Ronin, Keanu wanted it made so badly, but you could tell from previews there was no way it wouldn't be a flop. Truly like watching a car crash in slow motion. 




 I think the 'who will play Wiseau?' question will be quite interesting, as the way the book describes him, he's such a bizarre character that it would be near impossible for someone to make him look believable (the accent alone would be really hard to pull off) but if you've read the book, you'd also know you'd never **ever** want him anywhere near your film set. It's kind of like trying to get an actor to play Karl Pilkington; sometime life just throws up characters stranger than fiction. 




 I only started watching anime a few months ago, and I was wondering what anime from this season specifically I should be 'following,' using GIFs  of, that sort of thing. (kill la kill was this for me last season) So what do you, in all your infinitesimal wisdom, recommend? 




 Cool, Sjins getting a new youtube channel! 




 I remember seeing adds for it, it had Cameron Diaz in it I believe? Wacky heist caper? Anyway, I'm guessing their involvement was pretty much buried. 




 Don't forget he came off an extremely directorially powerful TV show, spaced, which even had a quentin Tarantino commentary! 




 Whilst DKR is certainly controversial, (It was my favorite batman movie, subjectively of course) I don't quite think it was bad enough to end the 'streak.'  




 Didn't something similar happen with the Ridley Scott Robin hood movie? Hollywood buys a script for millions of dollars called 'sherwood' about the sheriff of nottingham using Middle ages forensics and detective work to solve mysterious murders, but when they bring Ridley on board, it becomes another Robin hood movie because he wanted to do a movie with archer. 




 Is pyrion a house elf now? 




 I would personally like to see some western Sci-fi games developed into anime. Deux ex, Mass effect, Halo, that sort of thing, However, in terms of what would realistically get adapted a monster hunter Anime could be really neat, but only if they make it considerably darker than the games convey. (graphically) Monster Hunter could potentially have a really interesting world/action scenes if they let it.
