 You're right. Ratatouille's screenplay is easily the best among the Pixar franchise. 




 I agree with you on that.Though it is not number 1 on the box office.But still it has a gross.And its going to increase as the both the number 1 and number 2 films are a bit old now. 




 Everyone forgot E.T:The Extra Terrestrial (1982)
I would also like to add
Driving Miss Daisy (1989)
Ordinary People (1980)
Rain Man (1988)
The Breakfast Club (1985)
National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)
