 I attended public school in Alabama from 61' to 73 and I didn't get any gun safety training, but maybe that was because of integration and busing.

 If it okay to open carry in a bar or restaurant with a liquor licence, why would it be bad to sell alcohol at a gun show?    









 I don't think you would see a new international, pro-war, religious voting bloc. I think you would see a schism much like the one in the Anglican and Episcopalian Churches over the ordination of women and gays and gay marriage.

 In January 1835, then U.S. President Andrew Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that this has been accomplished. However, this accomplishment was short lived as a severe economic depression from 1837 to 1844 caused the national debt to increase to over $3.3 million by January 1, 1838 and it has not been paid in full since. 














 Did he predict where he would be today? 



















 Considering that in 1937 a dime would buy you a copy of Time magazine, a comic book or two cokes, I think it would be a little more than that.

 Pretty sure he is only going to secure the Texas-Mexican border, not all the states borders. 




 I bet 30% would say he isn't really human if asked. We have reached the point where people will say anything that they believe will make a politician that they disagree with look bad. 
























 Today Disney owns Marvel. They'd drop the Hulk and just call him Hogan. 




 So you're saying he wanted to give conservatives an issue to assrape him with? He saw the drunken monkey going for the gun and told everyone to stand back and let the drunken monkey have the gun because he wanted to be shot by a drunken monkey? It all makes perfect sense now.  




 **Headline ends in question mark?**

Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no." 




 Is the argument here that if we allow people to offer other people money to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do, there will be a decrease in people using violence to get other people to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? Like replacing slavery with jobs? 




 Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue. If we handle it as a mental disability, as in those afflicted by the disease would be eligible for entitlements, it might not be more effective than decriminalizing it, just more humane.  




 The problem is, both may be true. Small family farms, averaging 231 acres, make up 88 percent of farms, but 48 percent of total acreage, while very large family farms, averaging 2,086 acres, make up 4.6 percent of farms and 23 percent of total acres. Obama could truthfully say that this bill would affect only 4.6 percent of farms, but Romney could also truthfully say 23 percent of total farm acreage would be affected by this bill.

 Nothing in that video proved that any of those people were illegal aliens, that the bus was owned or was being operated by any branch of the government or that any of them were even using EBT cards.

 Oh look, the value of your home increased with that additional acreage. Guess we'll have to increase your land taxes as well.   









 But the lamestream media is controlled by the government?!? Right?!?  














 Once again demonstrating the level of ignorance that is prevalent in liberal corporate settings,

Their product is used three times more often than their next biggest competitor, is used more than the next six competitors after them combined, and yet they must be ignorant because they disagree with you.

 Mississippi is 37% black and Obama didn't win Mississippi in 08 or 12. 




 So in your opinion, [Rush Limbaugh's 2008 strategy](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2008/03/12/rush_the_vote_operation_chaos) was illegitimate.   




 Because there is no party registration in Mississippi, theres no way to know the affiliation of the people who voted in Tuesdays run-off. 

Chris McDaniel is assuming that these black voters are Democrats because they are black and apparently, so are you.  



















 Just because something starts creeping into the mainstream, doesn't mean it's good or permanent, remember disco?

 What if both parties had been "conceal carrying"? 
























 I wonder if people reacted like this to cops getting guns in the first place or when they got patrol cars or radios?  














 I don't think when a politician says that every American child should have the opportunity to get a college education, that they really mean that twenty years from now, there should be no one dropping fries at McDonald's, driving garbage trucks or running a register at Walmart. 




 Interesting, but I don't see how this is "political".
