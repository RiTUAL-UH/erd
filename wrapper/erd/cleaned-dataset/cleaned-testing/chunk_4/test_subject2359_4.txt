 And by boards ... they meant actual boards.  Like from a hardware store. 









 Look at his posting history.  He's an arrogant, incredibly shallow narcissistic trust-fund baby, with a sociopathic "fuck you, I've got mine" bent. 




 And tried to imply the swine flu was a Democrat conspiracy. 




 Some of them just naturally deserve to be gilded, like this one.  

Others don't, like all the other ones in this thread. 




 I ALSO HAD HIS FAMILY 




 If I had a good answer, I wouldn't be sitting around reading through /r/AskReddit/new/. 




 I KNOW WHAT YOUR MOM SOUNDS LIKE TRUST ME 




 Nothing will make you socially accepted.  That's why you're on reddit. 




 There's a Butt Lake and a Butt Mountain not too far from Butte County, so your inner 8 year-old can still have fun. 




 Yes, the [Modoc Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modoc_Plateau). 




 The KKC world. 




 This was triggered by rereading Kvothe lamenting the cold food in the different rooms the Maer put him in.  ... why is a skilled sympathist complaining about cold food, instead of linking the plates or food to the candles in the room and heating it all up?  Or to a bit of ash from the kitchen fireplace, which would always be going?

So what other things do you think you could come up with - if you were in that world and skilled at both sympathy and sygaldry.  Sygaldric telegraphs would be obvious, if limited by distance (five-to-six miles). 




 Yep - here's a picture I took a while back driving up I-5.  They just sort of pop up out of the middle of farmland:

 It stands out a bit.  As flat as Kansas through most of it, too.

And I always get a bit of a laugh out of "the Ohio River Valley" - you can't even tell it's a valley! 




 *Takes another drink.* 




 At this point, we're pretty much our own rivals.  And it's a pretty brutal matchup. 




  Please, just end the day with Bowman getting cut 

Yeah, about that ... 




  I don't even understand why Obama is trying to negotiate

Because he's sane, and knows that this is how nations act towards each other. 




 Work.

The Republican demographic is increasingly retirees. 




 Hmmm ... I think the database is flawed.  Looking at Lassen Volcanic National Park, a lot of those lines are hiking trails, not roads.  Doesn't seem to be a problem with other National Parks, though. 









 It doesn't have to *melt* it (though that's possible, at the hottest temperature for Jet A to combust), it just has to *weaken* the steel beams.  Steel and other metals become weak enough to bend far below their melting point. 




 Sorry for the dog analogy. I'm trying to housebreak a damn dog

No problem - we're trying to housebreak Oklahoma, but they keep shitting in the Senate. 




 ... yes, I did.  Repeatedly.  Again, you're far too stupid to realize how wrong you are.  The fact that you're an anti-vaxxer makes that clear, all of your posts here make it even more clear. 




 You obviously don't know what a strawman is.  Let's add it to your list of extraordinary ignorance. 




  So what good is a vaccine if it doesn't work?

It's called "herd immunity."  And it works for most people.  That's the whole damned point. 




 No, they were caused by seat belts working exactly as intended.

Vaccine injuries and deaths don't occur because the vaccine didn't work as intended, they occur because there are a *lot of people*, so some of them are going to have adverse reactions.

There are people allergic to peanuts, you know.  Should we ban peanuts? 




  How many more next month?

There will be a whole lot less than the number of people FUCKING DEAD from whooping cough, polio, rickets, and measles if those vaccines weren't issued.

Does this not even register with you? 




  If there were 117 injuries or deaths caused by faulty seat belts there would be outrage. 

There are three million injuries caused by seat belts a year, resulting in about 40,000 deaths.

So, you know, just keep on being stupid and poorly informed. 




 Yes, because preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths is completely trumped by preventing dozens of injuries. 




 I think you meant http://www.reddit.com/r/datgap, regardless. 




  One flight of Al Gore's private jet dumps more CO2 into the air than I will in the next million years from my fireplace.

Of course, this has *nothing to do* with CO2, but you just keep on kneejerking. 




  The plan worked

Except for the part where it resulted in a resounding and utter defeat? 




 ... and everyone everywhere continued to call it GIF.  The end.

 I just find it really contrived and boring to read a 3000+ page fantasy story about a guy making up a bunch of shit.

That's sort of literally what you're doing. 




 Because he's angry. 




 Brandon Sanderson takes a break from writing really big fantasy novels by writing somewhat big fantasy novels. 




 The most obvious possibility:  He's Lorren's son.  It was emphasized how tall he is, something that always comes up with Lorren; and he has very special privileges in the Archives. 




  I never said anything about the reasons behind wars

Of course you didn't, because doing so would undermine the entire point you obviously think you're making. 




  crackpot theory about them not attacking anybody for 200 years.

It's a crackpot theory?   Because you might want to read up on the very list you just cited - and feel free to point out in just how many of those conflicts Iran was the aggressor. 




 /r/AskCulinary will have some really great suggestions, I have no doubt.  Although you can make a really good white gravy from beef as well as pork. 




 Well ... dammit.  I can't argue with that logic. 




 "I guess a blow job would be all right." 




 *Checks user profile for /r/gonewild pics.*

*Finds none, so probably a dude.*

*Fuck.* 




 All of them?  




 Gravy.  Because why else biscuits?

Also, white gravy.  From pork. 




 Anything Wesley-centric in Star Trek: TNG. 




 Being a Browns fan. 




 Fuck upvotes, I want money. 




 Idalize.

Her older sister was named Paytin.

Yes, their parents were trash. 




 A couple of isolated old gold mines dripping with water, silence, and potential death. 




 Yes. Because yes. 




 Not sleeping with me.  I mean, it was cute at first, but now it's pretty grating. 




  Victim blaming is pretty fucking disgusting. 

The dead guy is the victim, not the incompetent cop who had to shoot an unarmed guy a bunch of times.

Am I correctly capturing your point of view here?

No.  You really, really suck at analogies.  Stop. 




  one of the officers said several times that the man was reaching for his gun...

"Oh, then perhaps it would make sense that I should stop him from doing that by restraining him. Nope, better shoot him a bunch of times."

... food for thought.

If you had to live off of food for thought you'd starve. 




  Which is when police are allowed to shoot your ass.

No ... no, it isn't.  But feel free to cite policy that says otherwise. 




 Yes, it's horrible how reddit has an "anti-shooting unarmed people for no fucking reason" circle-jerk.

It's not like we just watched a goddamned video where we can clearly see that happening or anything. 




 I started reading WoT in the summer of 1990 when I was 12, when tEotW first came out.

Yeah, that took a while. 




  What else could I mean by "full Clint Eastwood"?

Well, you could've been yelling at a bunch of empty chairs. 




 Actually it has nine. 




  This is bullshit and it does not belong here.

It's part of the response OP was fishing for, based on her reaction and posting history. 




 http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/full_menu_explorer.html

Looks like you can get all the bacon you want.  Guess you're just a moron.  Also ... you do realize hamburgers aren't made from ham to begin with, right?  Actually, you probably don't. 




 Was his name Bob? 




 "Bob had bitch tits." 




 Because news.yahoo.com is just some little independent blogging outfit, speaking truth to power. 




  What a pair they were.

"If you cut us, do we not bleed?"

"... no." 




 I'd argue this ... but there'd be a lot of spoilers. 




 5,000 tons heavier than a Tico, still called a destroyer. 




  If this dreadnaught-style, backwards-angled bow

It's called a "tumblehome" hull shape, and according to Wiki it fell out of style after Tsushima, but there's no source cited.  I'd guess it had more to do with limited deck space - once the dreadnought design came along, you needed more and more. 




  Also - I didn't know there was an Abrams tank.

... just, seriously?  Because it practically had it's own news channel during the First Gulf War. 




  Any day now

... the gold bugs have been saying for two generations. 




  Obama has nothing to do with it 

I'm guessing you'd be saying just the opposite if the economy was bad. 




 Former Yolo County resident here, more rainy days would have been kind of nice. 




  Northern California.

DON'T FUCKING ENCOURAGE THIS.

Good God, there's enough development already. 




 So I'm wondering how to gain that store-bought *sharpness* to my home-made Caesar dressing.  That sort of bite that a lot of bottled brands have, but that I just can't reproduce.

Anyways, numbers are real rough (eyeballed mostly), and I usually lay it on the heavy side with seasonings:

Mayo (store bought), 2 cup

Anchovie paste, 2 tbsp

Worcestershire Sauce 2 tbsp

Lemon Juice, 1 tsp

White vinegar, 1 tsp

Crushed garlic, 1 tbsp

Onion powder, 1 tsp

Salt, 1 tsp

Pepper, 1/2 tsp


But while it doesn't lack *flavor* (which is usually great), per se, it lacks that bite on the tongue.  It's just ... a bit too smooth and creamy.  I'm not looking to add heat, mind, so definitely not peppers/hot sauce, unless that's definitely the thing to do.  And I'm not looking to make a vinaigrette. Any possible suggestions?  Even maybe MSG?  I've thought about using plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, but that's a bit expensive. 




  I think they are trying to impress Billy ~~Mitchel~~ **Madison**.

 














  President Obama isn't the one who gets to decide what true Islam is.

Neither is ISIS, which is what they claim to do.

Imagine him putting on a tall hat and telling Catholics what the rules of Lent are.

Except he's not doing that in relation to Islam. 




 While normally I'd chalk this up to Walker being an asshole, in this case his office made a good point - there's no point in there being a state requirement when there's already a federal one. 




 Pretty sure the Roman Empire didn't fall because people won't use their turn signal.  But I can see how that might lead to the Nazis taking power. 




 "Forgot who I was" being the key phrase.  A bit of the way through kicking ass ... he remembered he wasn't supposed to be the kind of person who could do so. 




 Why unsuccessful?  The weather was somewhat windy, but there's not nearly as much snow as usual up there. 




 So radical Muslims wanted to use their Second Amendment rights to kill Obama?

Must be some seriously exploding Teabagger heads right about now. 




  rake the desert for ten hours.

Please tell me it was with a really big comb. 




  Its much easier and happier for Kvothe to just struggle to get a new patron than to have the emotional turmoil of getting Greyfallow.

The fact that we never see any of this even remotely touched upon in the books means ... plot hole. 




  Lettuce is the vegetable with just about the shortest shelf-life....

A head of romaine usually keeps for about ten to fourteen days for me. 




  I'd like to steer clear of the recent trend of signing old veteran WRs past their brief primes.

Like that Boldin guy?
 




 While true, *Paul's Boutique* is the superior album.

Though I've been able to sing the lyrics to "Paul Revere" word for word since I was like ten. 




  gruden never shuts up ~~about that game~~

 




  As for the Breden evidence, I have two major problems with it. First, it seems a little too easy to figure out.

I'd point out that to the average, non-obsessive fantasy reader, it probably is subtle enough to require a bit of chewing on mentally. 




 Shorter Answer:  Plot-hole. 




  And for the Whiners must be because we pretty much put the last nail on the coffin for their best HC since the 90s. 

It's come out that the Seahawks loss did that.  Not that it makes losing to the Raiders any easier, of course.
 




  from Fresno and go to school in Davis.

Talk about an upgrade. 




  businessmen are amoral pieces of shit without a shred of decency.

Class warfare detected.  You aren't supposed to say bad things about rich people, citizen. 




 Pretty sure that's supposed to be Fresno.

Bakersfield is actually California's asshole, not armpit. 




 I'd love to live there ... with some means of not dying of starvation and dehydration, of course. 




 You mean Sam the Not Actually A Plumber? 




  Also use an unlubricated condom to keep microphones dry without impacting sound too much.

Oh, good, I finally have a reason to buy condoms. 




 Hmmm, I've been infrequently using the same bottle for three years.  I should stop doing that - no infections, it's just not actually working anymore. 




 There's plenty of nice places in the north valley. 




  Speakng of Bredon, it occurs to me that he may have no social standing prior to his introduction and games of Tak with Kvothe.

Bredon has enough wealth   standing to have a couple of servants rushing around for him setting up table and chairs in Kvothe's room, as well to be talked about in the gossip of the nobility (the one about the pagan rituals). 




 We've been thoroughly exploring more options for almost four years.  But Bredon = Denna's patron was beaten over the reader's head in TWMF. 




 Sounds like someone's feeling irrelevant and wants attention. 




 Denna's patron is Bredon.

Just because it's obvious to us, after years of analysis and the Tor reread, doesn't mean it's not true.  It's probably not particularly obvious to the casual reader.   




 That's USS Alaska (CB-1). 




 ... whew, one letter away from disaster. 




 Pretty much my second favorite Justin Smith play of all time, after the strip in Philly. 




 While that was an awesome play, Brees actually managed to dump it off to avoid the sack. 




 I suspect there are two reasons:

1.)  The people involved are long past punishment.  Either dead, or no longer in the University.  For example, the frame seems to be about seven or eight years after the WMF narrative.  Sim, Wil, and Fela are no doubt long passed through the University, so can't be hurt by punitive action (there's also the possibility that some or all of them are dead, but I have my reasons for not believing this is true).  Riem's no doubt long retired, or he turned on Kvothe and deserves to be ratted out.  Elodin's pretty unlikely to give a damn about the other Masters' opinion, and they may even be amused that he burned Hemme's rooms.  Auri very likely has moved on, with her story having a conclusion that the world should be told about.  And what else has he told that really matters?

Also, keep in mind that he hasn't really given anything away about the Ademre that an astute observer couldn't figure out for themselves.  He doesn't really actually describe how they fight, and even if he did, what could you learn from words on paper that compares to years and years of excruciating, devoted training?  If anything, he enhances their reputation, by explaining that for all his talent and reputation, he barely studied amongst them, and barely touched on their abilities.

2.) There may be some secrets he just doesn't give a damn about giving away.  The Maer's arcanist trying to kill him?  Maybe that doesn't deserve to be a protected secret.    The Chandrian need to be told about.  Felurian will never know, and would be flattered anyways.  So ... who is being betrayed?  What secrets don't earn airing?
