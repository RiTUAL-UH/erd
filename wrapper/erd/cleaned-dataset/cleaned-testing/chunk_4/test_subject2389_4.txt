 So by "don't qualify" you mean "cant afford"? Start a kickstarter. I'll send yoh $50AUS. 




 I'm a bit of a foodie and I will spend approx 50% of my income on dining and drinking out. Compared with like 40% of it on rent and bills and such. 


I do it cos I don't give a shit about saving and I like being full and drunk.  




 What? I mean, what? 

I'm a chick bartender and I CAN'T give away drinks to guys I like the look of without getting punished in some way.  




 Have one of mine dude. 
 




 Hey man, I hope you don't feel humiliated anymore. My bro broke his neck and was in a spinal unit too. Everyone there shits themselves. He's out now and still occasionally shits the bed. We just tell him not to worry and wash the sheets. If your people don't understand your medical condition leads to you sometimes having accidents then you need new people. 




 Ambidexterity. Fine motor control on one side and gross on the other. 

No wisdom teeth. 
 




 Eddie Izzard. Unf. 




 Does this work for girls too? I'll try it next time I jerk it to confirm but anyone else out there? 




 Nail biter here. Sorry to disappoint.  




 When I slept with one. It was all legal, 2 years after I graduated, but that first kiss, first nakedness... man I liked him but it was giggly awkward.  




 Roads are public property. Therefore drinking in your car is consuming alcohol in public, which is against the law.  




 Marching in the ANZAC Day parade in the town square I'm lucky enough to get positioned next to my crush. 3 hours of the Australian sun later I get heat stroke and vomit all over his shoes. 


We never got together.

 100% agree. I loved Harry Potter and the Artemis Fowl series is the only other thing that ever came close. Don't know what every one else is on about, I loved every book in the series, the ending was perfect and brought it full circle. I bought every book the day it came out, same as HP. 




 Met my ex 2 weeks before I was leaving the country to live in England for a year. 

6 months later he came over to visit me, took me to Amsterdam, Paris and Ireland.

We were staying in a castle in Ireland when I told me he loved me and I lost my virginity to him while Rocky Horror Picture Show played in the background. 

I got the guts up to say it back to him the next morning. Very, very timidly...  
Looking back I think I only said it because it felt like the right thing to do. I love him as a friend still but I never felt as strongly about him as he did about me.
