 Thinking about experimenting with some oils and herbs. Really rub it on y'know? 




 If we learned anything from Twitch plays pokemon it should be Anarchy always 




 Is there any stream or pics of what it looks like today? 




 The inverse of 83 is actually 1/83, and also it was just a quote 




 17 it's always the inverse 




 I thought it was a hair covering everything joke. Either way though 




 Great Gig in the Sky- plane crash

And the entire Wall album's story is just amazing 




 For sure actually. Could Barney not have just told her what happened and she would have forgiven him? 




 well we are past the Golden Age of microbiology 




 The broken legs are a good reminder usually 




 Sorry, mistook that 




 Why do frats always seem to do this? Its one organization but as soon as things go south it's the one persons fault and everything is on them? Shouldn't the whole fraternities reputation take responsibility? Honest question 




 I just spent way too much time on that 




 Pretty cool, actually 




 I have no way to get the car off the ground and I'm in an apartment lot so don't want to spill oil all over 




 Granatomy 




 I agree. She did choose Don over Chicago but even after that she just goes back to how she was.  Ultimately I can't really say she changed. That's why Ted was a good match for her because he made her want to change  




 /r/simps 




 Adrenaline temporarily glues bones/muscles back together 




 Rewatch it... 




 Serious question: Why so many cases? How often do some of these actually get used? I don't just mean for this one word but any word 




 Like the slam dunk of basketball 




 That's awesome! Is it just me or can you not go upstairs though? 




 Learn a lot of languages 




 It does say 4 or 5 got added per season. I honestly thought it was like 2 per episode 




 I got in at the 2nd school I applied to so yep 




 This episode has the classic fun fact of Barney previously not knowing how to drive and yet in this episode he has a license. Not only that but what appears to be a rented sports car

Meanwhile Ted is far too nice like always and Stella is a grinch as per usual 




 The episode where Marshal gets dating advise from Barney and fails miserably. They make up at the end though 




 Thank you!! 




 Lol mortgage. I'm just a college student renting an apt but if you guys wanna kickstart me some beer money I wouldn't be opposed... 




 Ohh dang I just had it in the water. I just have to brown it though in a skillet then throwin it in a crock pot 




 Since this comment section is literally nothing I have a question about my frozen meat for this chili I'm making. I took it out of the freezer and it's totally frozen, what' the quickest way to defrost it?

edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone got it chillin in a ziploc full of water. Veggies are ready to go on the cutting board

Edit2: http://imgur.com/gBHxbJB chilli is a go! Thanks everyone! 




 Just because it's a new rule doesn't mean it's going to be enforced more 




 Even more amazing it was over $2000. You'll be losing money if you DONT buy it 




 It's not a top Sue Ellen 




 There's an episode when Kramer is driving the mail truck and he says he's gonna call Jerry and Newman asks how and Kramer says "I brought my phone", but that wouldnt be funny anymore b/c people wouldnt understand you cant just take your house phone out 




 But then it sounds like this: We invited JFK, the strippers... and stalin :/ 




 The How not to be Seen video from there was classic 




 Sort of the Banya of Seinfeld 




 Or just be loaded up on sandwiches going into it 




 That's actuaally pretty funny 




 So far it's have to poop htp, which doesn't surprise me 




 Definitely its a ramen noodle night twfbnfe4lol 









 Man hands 




 Yeahh. Had the show been like 3 seasons it would have been fine because we knew it was just about meeting her. By season 9 though I think us fans wanted to know all about her, not just the shadow. 




 I don't think there could possibly be an answer to this. If you think about it, he would have to be describing everything people are saying and where they are etc. It's sortof the difference between reading a book and then just watching the movie 




 Slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie 




 The douchebags are replaced with crazy people yelling at nothing. One time there was this old dude with his hands raised yelling "THIS! I CREATED ALL THIS!". It was funny though 




 My 3 hour layover in Atlanta was pretty much awful 




 I know right? My family used go on ferry rides from Bremerton just for the views 




 Only club in the Palouse maybe 




 I think it's totally unfair to Halliday what happened to him and I hope he recovers.

But this will be a great oppurtunity. Since this season is more or less over anyways Falk will get some good training in. Then the next 3 years he can continue on building a strong team and Mike Leach can steer him in the right direction 




 Thanksgiving day, in my opinion, is one of the busiest travel days of the year

I just want to punch her 




 Yes, and the stuff she said which everyone claimed to be funny just because she's not they type of girl who would say those things, was just painful to listen to 




 Yeah and that's because he looked like the definition of old school cool 




 /rising 









 What's with these?

http://pckeyboard.com/page/category/BargainRack

$2? 




 I don't know about jail but certain parts of your body would be a little too exposed for the impending plate throwing 




 I love craft beer but there's just those nights when I need me some PBR 




 I don't understand why he had to manipulate votes anyways. He got like no less than 500 points on anything he ever posted plus gold half the time. He said he downvoted info that wasn't correct, but people only paid attention to his posts anyways 




 Same here. They're easy to order, they dont leave you drymouthed like jack and coke, and you look cool 




 This is what always gets me. They're like yeah 1000 will pay my kids school, oh 60? Good thing the casino is right over there 




 I'm a college student who got rid of fb. It's really not that bad, you just have to use email more 




 So that he could once again talk to Tony and get his sweet archaeologist gig 




  If people upvote it, that means it's good content, plain and simple.

The people who upvote are probably the same people who forward emails 




 That may be, but the people commenting =/= the people upvoting. Theres plenty of examples of thousands of upvotes, but the few hundred comments are all negative towards the image. Usually the comment section is people who truly care about the quality of pictures on here 




 They also have soup. 500 50 oz cans of Chicken noodle comin my way 




 Ok wrong word lol. Not something you'll have the rest of your life.  




 You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers. 




 Yes, I work at walmart so walking around a lot so when I started working I bought a pair of Nike trainers and they've been amazing. I see my coworkers wearing chuck taylors and can't imagine the horror their feet are going through 




 Seriously. I mean I know everyone has that thing they like to spend their money on but buying coffee however many times a week is an astronomical amount of money on something that's not even tangible 




 Artificial sweetener like Splenda. Probably not the best but look how common it is now 




 I'm not sure what the WUE is but 1) I think if you applied now you would get in and 2) if you wait til December I think that's still plenty of time before the deadline although I don't totally remember

Plus doesn't your application update when your new SAT score comes in? I think it might 




 Keep your eyes out on CL 




 At least 3000. This is the type of thing where you just make a milkshake that's 1000 calories 




 Oh yeah I giggled for like a minute at lacrimal caruncle 




 is it the evidence of abstinence? 




 Initials plus lord helix since I made this when twitch plays pokemon was happening. I guess its just a cultural reference now 




 So should I take tests while hungry as well? 




 Yeah I watched all of Scrubs then someone tried to get me to watch house. House is just a dick minus being funny and I figured every episode was going to be like that. 




 I just think they could have labeled way more things, and way cooler things too 




 That's actually not that bad. Especially in that glass case, looks super nice. Plus all those random things put together some of which aren't exceedingly common. 




 First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...

Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.

I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.

Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin 









 Was that a recording of a crappy tv from someones flip phone circa 1996? 




 I've seen girls at my school walkin around in the smallest dresses of all time and heels in the winter on ice 




 I love the hair fwoop even though he doesn't have long hair 




 I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together 




 I always kindof thought that was off. Doesn't a judge have to be impartial? 




 coh-STANZ-a 




 Hope the cadavers in my anatomy lab appreciate these 




 She also tries to run off to Spain using the money they don't have when Marshal is being an environmental lawyer. Sounds more like something Barney would do 




 He is exactly what you need. No more, no less. 




 The thing about Jar Jar is that I've grown up to hate him. Ewoks are cool though 




 Us plebeians down here can only dream 









 That one girl towards the end just chanting in the dudes face. Such fury 




 That's what I thought it was until the end when everything just went on as is.  Ultimately though I think it was just a way to showcase the actors talents. Either way I thought it was a cool scene 









 Then years later marry the girl who helped him to live 




 I should, totally ruined my night 




 Yeah guess I got ahead of myself there thinkin I was goin for the easy kill 




 It was the best burger in NYC 




 If you're talkin Rogue Squadron there was the AT-ST walker level, the Tatooine race with the T-16, the cadillac, the millenium falcon, naboo starfighter. I love that game 









 Who's Zed? 




 I love Scrubs so much. The difference between JD and Ted is that JD is like hmm I haven't been laid in awhile guess I'll pull the doctor card and pull a hot girl while Ted overthinks everything 




 Technically that would still be 0
