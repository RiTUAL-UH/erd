 Yeah it's bold and it's good. Att next and other pay monthly per device plans are actually a good thing that has been implemented. They are a good deal.

 As a samsung fan, I feel disgusted. First it was the fake benchmark scores (geekbench being one of them) and now fake web comments. I know all companies do it a little but for samsung to be caught in the act, means they were doing a lot more than their share. Samsung makes a much more powerful phone than anybody else, but where is the backbone?
