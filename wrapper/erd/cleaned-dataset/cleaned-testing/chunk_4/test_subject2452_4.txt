 Shame on you. Can you imagine how the Mother 4 team must feel right now? They're trying to do something great WITHOUT pay in the few hours of free time they have outside jobs and school and this is what they get in return. Insults and accusations? THEY OWE YOU NOTHING! Even if this game never came out (even though they've assured us otherwise) it's still the closest we have to more mother content and that should be enough. It's still a beacon for mother fans everywhere that this game series is still loved and that love is shared. It's a message for Nintendo that our admiration for the series lives on. Also, I really hope you all think about the kind of damage you might be doing to this project. The mother 4 team is full of real people who can also be discouraged like real people. Now more than ever they need our support. Nothing would make me want to drop a project faster than to receive this kind of feedback from all sides. Count yourselves lucky that they haven't pulled the plug. Also I hope the mother 4 team sees this and knows that there are still many people who do believe in them and don't care if it takes months or even a year. This is too important to give up on, I'm rooting for you. *attempts to pray* 




 oh, I was commenting on mother 4's development time. Although I'm wondering has it been longer? I know I hadn't heard about it until it was quite a ways in. 




 Most of the people in this subreddit have grown up with the Mother series. Many years ago, I stopped waiting for a new game to come out. I knew it was over and the dust had settled on my adventures in the Mother universe. Now everyone take a minute to realize you're getting excited for a new Mother game. This is real excitement for a real event that had a one in a million chance of happening! I bet you wouldn't have known you could feel this excitement for the Mother series ever again, just 5 years ago. It's just....it's just beautiful. :) 




 if you'll look at the top contributor of the creepypasta wiki you found it on, you'll see the name test_subject2452. That's me. I'm not entirely sure how else I can prove it, I can write a comment on that wiki using my other profile if you'd like. 




 Thanks everyone. The guys over at 4chan are such dicks, after posting there I thought my story must have been garbage, but this was a nice confidence boost.
