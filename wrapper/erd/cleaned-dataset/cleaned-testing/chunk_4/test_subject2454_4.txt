 You've never experienced "X"? Therefore " X" must not exist. 




 Ha 




 The only way they can feel special. 




 Johnnies have been rumbled. 




 What's the alternative? Most good neighborhoods have an hoa attached. 




 Dank mimes bro. 




 "I totally expected that." "Naw man, it's ok." 

Seems like he's trying to justify being a pussy and not going after the guy that punched him for starting shit. 




 Or, he wanted you to give him a haram bj 




 Please post this to /r/shittyaskscience 




 Triple H would be proud at how you played the game. 




 I don't see how it doesn't. I'm a Hafiz, you can trust me. 




 wat?? 




 Not only the training and age, but coming back from a surgery that no fighter has really successfully come back from, much less retain the god damn belt. 




 Hurr durr let's compare fighters who are 100 pounds apart and talk about who would win in a fight. 




 Lesnar also had to be roided to the gills, so who knows how long that could have lasted. 




 I've got no problem with storebrand generic microwave "heated corn snack product,"  I would just prefer if it were to be labeled as such, and not sold as buttery movie theater popcorn goodness. 




 This sub has turned to this kind of shit.  Oh there's no drama here?  Better post it to /r/SubredditDrama !

There's no more real popcorn anymore.  Ony storebrand generic microwave "heated corn snack product." 




 I agree that a vast majority of cops are good, honest people. But the anger you are seeing here and other online forums is brought on by a feeling of utter helplessness. Where are the people supposed to turn for help when the ones assigned to help them are causing the hurt in the first place? 




 It's kind of a cop's jib to escort a woman in labor to the er, or talk a jumper down. Public safety and whatnot. Strange that you think those actions are somehow above and beyond the call of duty, when it is in fact the very description of their duty. 




 Imagine any decent qb with moss in their prime. He sent three average at best qbs to the damn pro bowl. Fucking cowboys and packers passes on him, and he specifically targeted them for ass rape ever since then, cause he wanted to play with aikman and favre. Hell, jerry even told him that if he fell to their pick, they'd take him.  




 Taking a shot at Tate? This is just some light hearted football rivalry banter. 




 It also dies a painful death because it doesn't fit the UFC's standard shitty posters with one fighter facing front in the foreground and the other facing sideways in the back ground. 




 The fight that never happened. 




 So....get ready for false convictions to go way up? 




 It's as if the show had shitty writers. 




 It will be front paged in under three hours guaranteed.  Book it. 




 paying attention to other bullshit....Not for Nick Diaz. 




 This mistake is common?  Time for the hipsters to move on. 




 What, so you only attack narrow minded people? You know, men prefer women with curvy minds, shitlord. 




 Really hard 




 What is that? 




 The end. 




 Le Neckbeardgini  




 Good for you 




 Sounds like divorce time 




 We get it 




 I always wanted to see a 100 home run season and a 500 strikeout season. 




 Pride Japan loved freak show fights. 




 LOOPHOLE MOTHERFUCKERS!!! 




 untestable for life 




 His fight with Lyoto was never officialy scheduled.  He's been offered Lyoto four times, and the refusal always came from Vitor. 




 I swear to god, if Machida ever pisses hot, I'm fucking done as a fan. 




 Depending in the car, that can easily get over $1000 




 That second one is now my standard go-to pose for all photographs.  




 This now qualifies as Disney actress? 




 There is no reason for him to. 




 Just cancel Dolloway all together 




 Real men like Terry Crews and Liam Hemsworth. None of that Artie Lang shit. 




 Why? 




 Ooooh baby 




 WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE, CITIZEN? 




 Vanilla is the most under appreciated ice cream, dawg. Especially if you can land yourself some Blue Bell. 




 Roids messin with his shit, lol. 




 SPOILERS!!! 




 That doesn't even make sense. Arabs are pedophiles, not zoophiles. 




 I'm in a few keeper leagues.  My commish just keeps an active google docs sheet that everyone can access, but only he can edit.  Trades are announced to the league via email, or whatsapp, then recorded in the google docs. 




 At this point, I would pay ludicrous amounts of money to watch Cerrone repeatedly punch himself for 5 rounds, and then simply be awarded a belt. 




 I was gonna buy tickets to this one since I moved to LA.  Guess not. 




 *I've come to talk with you again* 




 Isn't Also also ridiculously young? 




 just wrestling, right? 




 And on top of it all, it's was completely pointless and unfunny. 









 Excellent 




 There's no fucking drama here.  This sub is just starting to point out tiny bitch fights everywhere, labeling it as "drama" 




 For real. I've never met anyone that listed The Amazing Spiderman as their favorite movie.

Damn I'm old. 




 I have one of those! 




 a shitty website 




 Greater Dehli and Greater Mumbai larger than Texas. 




 Because this is America and she can do whatever the fuck she wants with her personal property? 




 Naturally occurring, or the result of too much tampering with sharks and tornadoes by man? 




 link? 




 Arabs are known for being cost effective. Good point. 




 No he's not. Uriah Faber has a much deeper butt chin. 




 Well, watching certain fighters is torture. *cough* Ben Askren *cough* 




 Not from the pain. Certain submissions cut off blood and or oxygen to the brain. Thus the black out. 




 He remembers me! 









 Wake me up from this dream 




 I wonder if there's a subreddit specifically for old school cool pics. 




 I'm not a racist, but nigger 




 What, what? 




 McGreggor carrying UFC lol 




 Rolling 




 Probably shouldn't have ordered 6 crates of special edition bluerays of Scorpion King 4 




 Seriously.  I'm sick of seeing a guy get dominated for 4:45 of the round, then pull a takedown for the last 15 seconds and win the god damn round. 









 I like when people try to talk in legalese and get all technical, but they clearly have no idea what the next words out of their mouths are gonna be. 




 That was brilliant 




 Does a tuna sandwich really pair well with Mac and cheese? 














 /r/SubredditDrama 

They follow controversy around reddit and observe from the sidelines. 







































 Can some one tldr this.  Laptom speakers crapping out. 




 This is SRD worthy 




 Tried it 




 Music scene wise, maybe you're right.  But the radio stations are the blandest bland I've ever heard.  and I've lived in Dallas and Miami, which both have pretty bad station lists.  But nothing has been as pop driven as LA. 




 Damn.  Godwin's law smacked this thread in the face with it's dick. 




 confirmed 




 97.9 seems to be the most active rock station as far as the music scene in PHX.  They do local music shows, band auditions on the radio, as well as being heavily involved in small venue concerts.  Also, that station actually plays rock music, and not just pop rock that you'll hear on KISS FM or JackFM. 




 wot 




 My mind's telling me noooooo 




 Phoenix has phenomenal radio stations, and a really thriving rock music scene.  When I moved to LA, I realized how good I had it.  Everything here is just generic genericism.  But I guess I should expect no less from where pop culture is born.  




 This will be reposted in under 5 hours and reach the front page. 




 Good sounding too. Probably good feeling as well. 




 That was my point, sorry if it came out wrong.  Colt is a fucking legend in Texas, so him beating the cowboys was kind of bitter sweet to a lot of us Texans. 




 With Colt McCoy no less. 




 How is that not a catch? 




 Holy shit.  




 Every time 




 So being an overall asshole is considered insanity wolf now? 




 No more Josh Smith, easy peasy. 




 Brazilian Japanese 




 Finally, a non shit-post TIL 




 Seriously, with all those colleges in Boston and their sporting facilities, would the city even need to build anything? 




 NO RAGRETS! 




 Isn't that pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell? 




 Reposts. Not everyone saw it the first time. 




 That's pretty much how it is in England. 




 [Lyoto "The Dragon" Machida](http://static.enlapelea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MachidaLyoto.jpg)


I'm a straight man 




 She started out as the character I hated most.  But as the seasons went on, and the show kept getting worse, she started growing on me more and more. 














 I play CSS mostly, and this was a huge problem for us. And while it seems that aimbots and such are being detected, and people are being banned, can anything be done about players using materials hacks? Ultrabrights, walls, etc. The pre-firing behind walls and doors in some servers is ridiculous. 



















 It's an amazing card, and I just moved to LA.  I want to go to this, but I have no friends out here.  Can we get a group together for this or something?

Would I be better off posting this in /r/LosAngeles ? 














 Like a sports bar or social club or something?  Is there a directory for that sort of thing?  I would also like to watch Dallas Cowboys games too. 





























 Time for Taraweeh.....
