 Ok, I don't have any spare codes but if you give me code I'll send you a link to a website for your xb1. On it you can play classic arcade games, app store games and other similar titles. 














 Are the codes together (both games in one code or desperate codes) 




 Thanks :D I was thinking of waiting till I see what days I'll be working. So if I was to work Mondays, Wednesday's and Saturdays I would come home and do revision/homework then leave for work and go to the gym on Tuesdays, Thursday's, Friday's and Sundays after homework/revision. The reason I don't just do gym or work is cause I dont want my parents to pay my gym membership since they pay for my Netflix, xbox etc so a job would let me pay it myself and get a few other things. I'll figure it out, thanks for answering. 




 I know it's been removed but force yourself. Just make yourself do it. In my old school I liked a girl, this was two years ago. I was too late when I finally went to ask her out. By the time I went to ask her she had gone with someone else and they're still together. I moved on and later found that I really ***liked*** my friend Chelsea. We had been friends for years and I said screw and asked her. She said yes!! I moved away not long after which really upset me but at least I asked her. Just force yourself before it's too late. 




 Me too. I have friends outside if school who I lobe being with and friends at my old school.  It the people I talk to in school aren't going to be people I'll talk to when schools done or in the summer etc I'm just kinda ***that*** friend too. 




 We play xbox. Watch movies. Go to the cinema. Go to the comic-book shop and walk around when we're bored. 




 Hey guys. I turn 16 this month and I'm going to get a part time job. I also decided that I would start going to the gym. How can I balance school, homework/revision, work and gym? Do any of you do this?  









 Let's do this!! 




 I love it too and I've re-read it a few times but nowhere near fifty!! :D 




 Oh that's too bad. You should definitely re-read them. 




 I love the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!!  




 No problem :) 




 I love the the Harry Potter series. I'm re-reading it now in fact. 




 Oh I loved the Harry Potter series. I've actually just started re-reading it again for like the fifth time. 




 For book tips I suggest you read:

"GONE"

 By Michael Grant l. It's a six book series and I absolutely loved it!! I became so attached to the characters and hated some and so never found a second of any of the plots to be dull or slow moving. Definitely worth your time. Just a tip they are read in this order:

* Gone

* Hunger

* Lies

* Plague

* Fear

* Light 









 I never hack accounts. I know how to but I would never do that. I also never mod online games. I will only ever mod so how player games or sections of games because I can make things more fun. I do it for my pc games and sometimes for my xbox games. Like I said though I would never annoy someone with nodding or hacking. When I rarely take mods online it's with my friends and we just mess around. For the most part I just prefer to play the game without mods because I think it's better the way it came. Gta Iv and skyrim are great for mods. 




 My top 5 in no order:

Tomb raider series (old and reboot)

Halo series

Gta series

The walking dead (telltale games)

Mass effect series

(Some honourable mentions: Elder scrolls and fallout series, and the Sims series) 




 I'm starting to workout and want to see how far others have made it. Though I won't be working out obsessively. I'm going to start the gym in March/April but right now I'm just doing it around the house. 




 When I started nofap I made it to around two weeks (I'm a teenager and my hormones got crazy) now on my second try I made it to 3 days. I know it's not great but I've learned from it. 

In the time I quit I've started going outside with my friends... a lot. I used to never go outside I would only talk to them at school and through the internet. 

I'm a typical "nerd" so I don't have giant muscles etc but I started working out.

I've stopped procrastinating... as much and I only play my xbox for an hour or so a day now (I used to play for at least 7). 

All of this is great and just because I relapsed isn't going to stop me from doing them. Even if I was fapping regularly I could do this but nofap helped me realise it. 

All of this could just be a placebo effect because I read about other people's benefits from nofap. Even if it is I don't care. I don't because I feel more energetic and alive and I owe that to nofap. 

I'm going to start again today and hopefully make it. But untill then I'll just go a day at a time, learn from my mistakes and keep the benefits. 




 Finally!!  




 Hello everyone. I'm a 15 year old guy. I'm about 5'6 tall and I'm pretty skinny but not underweight. I'm wondering if I'd maybe look weird with abs and noticeable upper body muscles since I'm so short.   Also I have asthma which is another reason I want to start, to help improve my lungs. I kind of look like a typical geek (which I kind of am which makes posting here weird for me since I never work out) Can any of you give me any tips on how to get upper body strength, abs and a good work out plan. I don't want to take protein shakes etc but I'm willing to eat healthier.  









 I'm from Scotland and when I saw this on the news I found it kind of annoying. He isn't a pervert or anything and he makes kids happy. 




 Not a theory. Read the books. In them it's heavily, heavily hinted at. 




 Exactly. It wasn't the people's fault and the children were indoctrinated so much so that they worshipped Hitler right up untill their death!!  




 I agree with you 100%. The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said though it might not be the best time to release it but I agree that we should learn from history, move on and not repeat it. 




 I agree (not as an American, I'm scottish). The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate  Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said it could happen in any country. 




 Leave it doesn't matter if he's the "best man ever" when he's sober!! No matter what call the police and leave him. 




 Post this on /r/relationship_advice 




 Exactly!! I do think it was necessary to start with due to Hitler's indoctrination of the young Germans of that time.  




 I agree take something away and it makes it more desirable. I do think it was necessary to begin with though due to the fact that most of Germany had been indoctrinated by Hitler and the Nazis but the fact is Germans of today don't agree with what happened.  




 I agree with you one hundred per cent. People seem to have a mind set that Germans are all Nazis because of what happened 75 years ago.  




 They're great!! :D 









 Stop masturbating. It's often cause of the fact that you have left over sperm in you urethra. 




 Yeah they're good together :) 




 Actually no I'm not. I have very high marks in all of my science classes which I love and history, music, maths and English. I just don't believe that dinosaurs existed. I do believe humans have been too the moon but I don't think it was when they said it was. I'm not into conspiracy theories but I just don't believe it.  




 I love them together!! :D 




 I don't believe that dinosaurs ever existed and I also think the moon landing was fake and it was a way for the Americans to win the space race (I'm not Russian) but I do think that it has been landed on since. 




 Okaaaay... 




 I don't know I've never really liked Jackie Chan but I see why you'd like them a lot of people do. 




 Me too they have great chemistry on screen and you just know that they're friends offscreen too. 









 Great!! :D when you get it if you need someone to play just pm here and I'll add you :) 




 Yeah archaeology. I know it's tough but I know archaeologist and I'm from Scotland there is still a place here which actively hires archaeologists. Thanks if I have any questions I'll message you!! :D 




 I want to be either an medical doctor or an architect (I'm still undecided but I've wanted to be a doctor since I was 3 and been thinking a lot about archaeology for a while now). So I'm going to volunteer at a dig and help out at my local hospital but both are voluntary and I want to be able to make my own money during the summer :) 




 Do you remember what it was like when you were dead? 




 Aaah the invention of the wheel... I remember it well. 




 How old are they?

I suggest you take them out too the movies and buy them a nice meal that they wouldn't eat on a regular basis so something like a McDonald's if they don't get them a lot. Then before you come home buy them a movie. When you get there build them a couch fort, lay out a ton of candy, ice cream, biscuits and cake etc then put on the movie (make sure they pick which one in the store). Let them sleep down there and wake them up in the morning with cartoons and pancakes. It's a lot of work but they'll love it!! 

That's if they're a bit younger basically not teenagers yet. If they're older just say and I'll give you some tips :) 




 Hi, it really depends on you. Both have some great exclusives and great players. I'm personally more of an xbox guy but I'll list the pros and cons of both

***xbox one pros***

It has a great interface

Ability to "snap" apps which means that you can play a game while watching a movie or skypeing etc

A lot of amazing exclusives and timed exclusives like tomb raider, sunset overdrive and halo

A great company ( MS) 

***Wii U pros***

Great exclusives like Zelda, Mario and a bunch more I honestly think it's one of the most under rated consoles ever!!

It's unique with the controller I like having the pad.

It's a nice slim console

It is backwards compatible with Wii games

It is free to play online

It's cheapei

It's good for families

***xbox one cons***

If you buy one it will cost you more than the Wii u

It is pretty big (not as huge as people make out but it takes up some space)

You have to pay a monthly subscription

It's not backwards compatible with previous xboxes

***Wii u cons***

It doesn't have as many online players as xbone/ps4 but it's not a huge deal

Even though it has a ton of great games and exclusives it doesn't get some of the best games like gta.

It can't be used for things like tv unless of course you're using netflix etc




Both consoles are great so either way you should be happy. Happy gaming, when you choose let us know what you pick and I'll play with you :) 

 




 Hi reddit, I turn 16 in March and I'm still a student. I'm wondering if any of you know of any types of jobs I could do part time. I don't mind if it would only be for the summer or if it would be year round. I live in a suburban area of a city so I can easily get to malls etc. Any help would be appreciated. 




 Because I have a lot for 360 and mainly only dlc  for the one. 




 Ok cool if you want I have a halo MC collection dlc and some gta money and as for games (I mainly have physical copies) but I have a few codes. What type of games do you like? 




 Oh also if you don't like the games I say later if you're in the UK I'm willing to post them to you and I won't ask for the code untill you get the game in the mail. 




 Hi, do you want a game code for 360 or one. 









 Oil isn't all we have. We have tourism, agriculture, whiskey and about 50,000,000 other attributes, people only seem to think about oil. 




 Ha, ha!! :) 




 I'd sent them a postcard :) 




 While we're technically together Scotland has a lot of its own laws, it's on education system and by politicians I meant where they're from.  




 I'm not going to get into it cause I'll just rant. I don't so much hate the English people (well I hate some English but not cause they're English, I don't judge people cause of where they're from). Anyway I hate your government, politicians and a lot of English people (but like I said not cause they're English).  




 Still you touchy for me too. 




 Hopefully there will be a next time. 




 I know it's weird but I like our weather. If you put all Scots in the heat for too long we fry 




 :) I agree 




 I agree we don't need the union. 




 I agree :) 




 I agree 100% 




 Yup scottish here. I don't like being called Brittish so I guess you can figure out that England isn't exactly my favourite place. 




 Why?  




 Has your opinion changed since the referendum?  




 Ha, ha true. I occasionally watch the river side show on stv Glasgow but not often. 




 I would remove Scotland from England and move it (Scotland) and Ireland slightly closer to Norway.  




 Actually all the UK has done is made people ignorant about us. We have a ton of tourists visit here year round and that has nothing to do with being in the UK. It's to do with our land, the people, our myths and a ton of other things. Being in the UK is simply a drain of our resources. 









 In Scotland we have [stoor worm](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoor_worm) which is the equivelant of the Norse midgard serpent which, was also called the world snake. 




 I love Scottish culture but hate that we're part of the UK. 




 I guess xbox, science, books, music, movies and shows. It depends on the person. 




 I will, I hope she gets better. I'll say a prayer now and at mass tomorrow (if I make it). I' 




 I don't know if this will work but try /r/donate or /r/donations hopefully one will work  




 Ha, ha Hail sithis!! :D 




 How so? 




 Actually they are. People need to pay companies like Amazon to sell anything on their sites, then you throw in people that advertise there and, if I keep using Amazon as my example, they sell things like the kindle. 




 Shave or trim "down there". If done correctly it feels smooth, looks nice, stops you from sweating as much,  stops odour, protects against crabs for those of you that have a lot of sex and a bunch of other positives. 




 I made it for motivation not to discourage anyone. 




 Thanks, sorry it turned into this.  




 Well at least we now know reddit masturbates.  









 Hey you were the one who started this. You saw and said you would report me get over it!! Not everyone is religious, is there for those who are! 




 No, he'll is for the worst of people and as long as they haven't committed any seriously immoral sins (like murder, rape or anything along this  lines) I believe they will go to heaven. 




 I'm not forcing them on you. Simply by saying I have them is forcing them? If someone doesn't have a religion that's fine, to each his own but simply because it's there you started.  




 Look I put it in there for those that are religious, don't like it then leave. You can't complain about someone else's beliefs. Ok not everyone is religious but like I said it's there for those that are!! This really isn't a big deal. You're making mountains out of mole holes. No one else here has complained, look at the other comments that have stemmed from yours. Two other people agree with me. It's not a big deal. 




 /u/Poropopper don't worry about it I'll add it cause I know that a lot of people here do meditate and it might give them a boost :) 




 /u/decisionmadetoday you are basically saying someone can't even mention **their** religion without you getting all hissy pissy about it. Everyone has a right to their beliefs. I respect yours, please respect others. 




 I do it for myself and just cause even though no one gets all the negatives many do get at least some and I don't want that also I'm religious so that comes into play. 




 Thank you :) 




 Coolio that gives you a cool reason to keep going... untill you decide not to. :) 




 I never felt tired after fapping and during my last streak I definitely had more energy Infact I still do because I said I wasn't going to let myself lose it and I haven't!! :) I still prefer being on a streak than fapping. 




 Exactly :) 




 What did I do? All I said was that I added it for those that are. I made this to help motivate people and if you don't like it then go away. 




 And I'm the weird uncle that for whatever reasons lives in your basement :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Thank you :) 




 Sorry if you guys don't like it. I made it cause these are all things I've heard people say have happened to them and I thought I'd put all the negatives vs all the positives. 




 Ha, ha ***hillarious*** 




 Ha, ha :)  




 Oh well that's up to you. 




 Yeah a lot of people in puberty say that. I think it has something to do with their testosterone levels. 




 That's good then cause you don't have to go through what some others will, good luck :) I added all the other stuff for those that get it since I've seen a lot of posts mentioning these things. 




 I think I might add something about meditating since a lot of people do it. Yeah in fact I'll do that soon :) 




 Hey, I'm not saying everyone's going to feel any or all of these but I made it for motivation for those that do :) 




 Ha, ha I ***should*** add that :D 




 No I mean that a lit of people that watch too much porn come to disrespect women or think that their penis should be like 10 inches. Also I put religion in there for those that are religion. If you're not I'm sorry if it offended you. 




 I see what you mean. I'm not trying to say someone's going to get all of the negatives and/or all of the positives but this is what people have reported (all different people) so I figured it could be used for motivation. 




 Some people are religious. Some aren't. I put it in for those that are (like me).
