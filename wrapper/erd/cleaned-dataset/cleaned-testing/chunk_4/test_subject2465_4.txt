 They didn't even release this on Twitter  




 Yep.

Lets not ignore Pakistan using radical muslims to stir up tension in India

 Join me in Nihilist-land 




 No one told you to spend your free time not-studying 




 He gets around it by never directly taking money himself.

 Funny you say this. All of her subordinates were stumbling and nervous 














 Mitt Romney's binders of women 




 All things considered, theres far more corrupt places than the United States.

Theres a reason schemes keep getting more elaborate.

Everywhere is complicated, but still.

 Yep.

FIFA is inherently almost supposed to be corrupt. You can't run something that big without it being so.

This is just a temporary reset on the grift and gives the semblance of balance so the next corruption bubble can be burst years from now.  




  Man....if this is the beginning of the end for FIFA and their corrupt ways

LOL

How naive.

You'll never have an international sports organization that isn't somewhat corrupt.

It just seems that this will be a temporary reshuffling just to give the semblance of justice

 why do you think I would agree with you on any particular issue, on the virtue of having a real democracy? 




   In a real democracy, our thoughts would be more aligned

You sure about that?
 



















 Don't hate the player... 




 I DO understand it.

But i'm asking if its really and truly a good idea.

Theres a lot of people in the US who I absolutely think don't either appreciate what it takes to run a nation like the US or has the balls to be assertive enough to lean on other nations in large geopolitical matters.

I partly worry that the average person is either uneducated or simply...too nice and thus, naive.  




 don't hate the player... 









 You're not really answering me here.

 









 OK...but what does this mean?

I mean, what would a "real" democracy produce in the US? 




 So?

R D is hard...and thus expensive 




 Just curious about the extent to which you all support "change" and "revolution" when it comes to thought and progress in addressing some of the issues prevalent on this subreddit.

 What attack on freedom of speech occurred?

 He ran MARTA for 11 years and still couldn't elevate it beyond what we have now 



















 The Falklands aren't close to the UK either... 




 You say that like its a bad thing... 




 Japan claimed those islands...and China is building a military base in the middle of the water.

Its a provocation on their part as to relative assertiveness in the region. 

Its not in the US's interests to let this continue. 

That being said, you HAVE to watch the video...its wild. Theres declassified info there
 



















 Who is "they?" and how do you determine that?

Even partially 









 Good point. We need more density IN ADDITION to commuter lines. 

Turning ATL into Boston/DC-light isn't a bad thing

We don't need a damn train to lovejoy. We need lines to west midtown, to EAV, to VAHI, collier, etc.


We do. The Original plan was to go to Griffin 




 I don't drive on every highway either.  




 They need to re-write its charter to get it federally funded.

More rail is what we need. Period.

  Nobody was even at the house.

So? 




 The irony of it being **Bill O'Reilly** does

  I didn't see them attempt to transport her in an unmarked vehicle, but if that's what they were attempting to do then good on the community.

  To me, Warren has always seemed to speak the unfiltered truth

When you say this, no matter how much I agree, I can't take you seriously.  




 She hasn't done anything though 
























  Sending special operations forces into Syria via helicopter is a balls out move.

Not really. They've gotten fairly good at it, it seems.

 I wish there were videos of this 




  I had only heard about the MOVE bombing in philly for the first time yesterday

This is what really gets me. As a black guy, this stuff is engrained in me.

And so many other people never really come to look into this 









 Don't forget that anus.
