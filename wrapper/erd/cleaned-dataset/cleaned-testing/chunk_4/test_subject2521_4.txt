 You make a valid point, but I expect this to refer to the hiring of 'professionals' who received a Masters or PhD in the subject matter, but do not have a teaching degree. 

edit: spelling

*** If you were in Lawrence March of 2006, you're familiar with this type of storm. 




 She's driving the equivalence of a Ferrari compared to my Barbie Jeep of the 90s.  









 I'll believe it when it happens.... 




 Works when I click on it. 

I know, but it's still ridiculous. Especially when they do this every term. This time they actually have a reasonable excuse. 

Edit: more words 









 Re-organize everything in the office. Go through all the cabinets, rearrange as desired. Check to see if all file cabinets are in the correct order and properly labeled and do whatever possible to not lose your mind. You could also read. Decided that route after reddit got boring and so did other sites. 

 




 Didn't see the typo. Meant drawn not drown.  




 Thank you!! :-)

I have a few ideas, but just the base drawing. This drawing alone took several months. Started in December and spent days looking at it until I finally decided where to go from there.  




 Mix with Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur and Bailey's Irish Cream. Loved making that shot during my college years... 




 Plan to after I finish the drawing! :-) 




 Thank you so much for posting that! I couldn't stop laughing!!! :-)  




 If it's a busy time of the day and you're making it easier for the waiter/waitress to clean your table...what's so bad about that? 


The same thing can be said about grocery stores. If it's busy and a sacker isn't available; sack your own groceries while items are being rang up. It will cut down on the time spent by the checker and holding up the line.  









 The annual WOW (Women Opening doors for Women) 5k Run is in need of sponsors for the Sunday, May 11th event (Mother's Day). If you know of businesses in the Lawrence area that are interested, please have them contact Body Boutique! (785.749.2424)

This years run will benefit Women Build, a Habitat for Humanity affiliate that enables volunteer women to learn construction skills and make a difference by building homes and communities.

***Runners and volunteers are also welcome!

 It's promoting irresponsible drinking and increases the chance of unwanted sexual encounters - i.e. sexual assaults of female patrons. 
 




 I thought so too. We had half a cup of heavy cream left, so I decided to use that and half a cup of milk. Maybe the combination wasn't the best choice. Plus, I had under 2 lbs of russet, so I used new potatoes to even out to around 2.5 lbs.  




 Thanks! My boyfriend loved it!!! :-)

Also made a Guinness Chocolate Crepe Cake with Irish Cream Whipped Frosting. There's a picture of it somewhere on /r/pics.

 Recipe: http://www.surrealconfections.com/2013/03/irish-crepe-cake.html?m=1

Tips:

- Each crepe takes between 15-20min to prepare. ~10 minutes for the first side and, give or take a few, about 5-10 once you flipped to the other side.

- If you have more than one saute pan, you'll be a lot happier. I wish I had at least 4. Otherwise I spent between 3-4 hours just to make the crepes.

- Try not to eat all the whipped cream before spreading it onto the crepes!!! :-)

Sorry for the bad pictures. I was really excited to make this for St. Patty's  and wanted to share; even though it looks sloppy. 

Edit: More info

 It's how you form the balls by folding the dough. The bread book illustrates what to do. Sorry about that.

**I have included pictures on how to work with the dough on the imgur page**!!! 




 My boyfriend and I go through at least a dozen store-bought in a week. After looking over all the ingredients, I decided homemade was the best way to go! If you're interested in homemade breads, The Bread Bakers Apprentice is a must! We make 2 -2lb loaves of French Bread every week instead of buying bread for sandwiches, toast, etc.  









 I searched Irish foods and nothing came up so I posted here. Thanks for sharing the sub-reddit. I'll definitely check it out! :-) 




 Thank you so much for all the replies! I can't wait to try several of the recipes from these sites!!! :-) 




 My boyfriend and I like to celebrate holidays by preparing authentic meals. Unfortunately most of the recipes I come across are Corned Beef and Cabbage which, clearly, is not a traditional Irish recipe. 

Would /r/ireland users please share some of their favorite recipes? I would truly appreciate it! :-) 




 If it happens in Kansas, it's likely to spread. Look what has happened over the past few weeks.....

There stands a chance that future generations will be ill-equipped in understanding the fundamentals of life, but that already remains a problem in states promoting creationist ideas.  




 Here's a direct link to the bill - SB 401

 Thanks for the tip on posting to this sub-reddit. 

As you can see, I lowered the asking price via the reddit post and will change the price on craigslist later today. 




 I'd like to make at least $600. 

The piano is in great condition. Originally cost about $6,000 and I'd hope to get something out of it - more than just the moving cost.  









 Yeah, that's the one.  




 Thank you!  




 I had planned to with a recent ticket but it had already reached the '$10' fee and decided I may as well check to see if I had any more that haven't been paid.  









 Had the same problem on youtube; but thanks for the suggestion.  




 Got it to work. Thank you! :-) 














 Macro lens was used to add the creative touch.  














 If you want to receive a tax write-off, take them to the Topeka Public Library (http://tscpl.org/friends/donations/). I had boxes of textbooks and that was the best option.

The only place that accepts books in Lawrence is The Dusty Bookshelf (http://thedustybookshelf.com/). Last I heard, other stores have closed. 


*Oh and freakin' sweet username. 

Edit: Typos 




 A lot of people don't take into consideration that Christmas isn't the only holiday this time of year, so I spent a few hours this morning creating a collage of different holidays celebrated in the month of December. Enjoy!  














 Christmas gnomes.... 




 My apologies, I did not know that.  




 Clearly staying home is the best option.

 Lawrence still has bad drivers after  college students leave.  




 Too lazy to read through all the comments......


Has anyone taken a picture of the van or the license plate? I'd get in my car and follow the van... 




 You're welcome! :-) 




 Unless you work for a business owned by a family and you all eat lunch together. Instead of going back to work, if nothing needed to be done immediately, we'd take a full hour break (or longer). Plus on Thursdays, they'd pay for my lunch when we ordered chinese food from a restaurant nearby with great lunch specials. 

It depends on the work environment, but I always enjoyed lunch breaks. 









 Great read. Thanks for the post! :-) 




 That, I did not know. Since this was a new article, I felt it worthy of being posted. Others might agree.  




 o_O? 




 I never understood the obsession other women have over diamonds and always felt it was a marketing scheme. Turns out my intuitions were right.

In today's world, a lot of marketing can be seen as a scheme. Hell with all the photoshop enhanced pictures, even what is perceived as 'true beauty' is a scheme. Unfortunately a lot of people fall for the hype. 

I didn't post this for intentions of 'clickbait'. I share stories I find interesting, and with other people. That's what this sub-reddit is all about, whether or not you agree, or approve, of the post. 


Edit 1: Typo 




 I couldn't think of a creative title.  














 HA! My mom puts these on cars back in the 90s! And yes, the same one! 

 




 Thanks. Nice username, too.  









 They're called fraternities. Or the greek community, in general.  




 He's really nice once you get to know him. Someone in town created a facebook page and people post stories and what he is up to, on a daily basis. Plus, he's open to having his picture taken with his doll.

I do not know a lot about him, but I've been told he has a job and a home. There are a lot of homeless (and mentally unstable) people in town, but he has a lot going for him, dispite his circumstances. 




 Don't hate what you can't understand.

There's a guy in town who pushes a doll in a stroller and often wears womens clothes. Turns out his wife was killed a few years back and its his way of coping - also schizophrenia (sp?) but it was caused by his loss.  




 Try 8 years. Just can't tolerate caffeine (sp?) or carbonation.  




 Rope Burns is the chapter in the book Million Dollar Baby for which the movie is based.  




 Really? That surprises me quite a bit. I worked at a food bank for a while and they'd receive 'damaged' merchandise. Once FruitLoops (sp?) sent them a large shipment of cereal b/c they left out one color.  




 If you're driving to buildings such as Snow Hall -since you can access the back of the building even if campus is closed - there's no way to not drive on campus.  




 I found it ridiculous since it happens everyday and the crosswalk isn't that far from their houses. 

Clearly this sort of thing happens all over campus, but that's a heavily trafficed area. 




 Wow, can't take a joke? Sorry I forgot to add 'JK'. 

I served my time as a part of the  greek community , so I thought the generalization fit rather well.  




 But then you'd be at fault for running over/ hitting a pedestrian, even if they deserved it. Could you live with that? 




 And not a true graham cracker, unfortunately. Didn't know that until I had received a cookbook a few weeks ago as a present. One of the last recipes is for graham crackers and it even includes information about the origins! 

Sorry, I do not recall the title right off. If you're interested, I'll provide that later.  




 I suggest going on a self-discovery. Spend some time finding out who you are, why you do the things you do, and what has led you to where you are today.

I've spent the past year doing this and just this week, I finally found the answer I was looking for. It wasn't easy coming  to terms with it, but I now know why I behave the way I do, today. 

I wish you the best of luck! :-) 




 None of you are correct, it's To-Puke-a.

 




 Try to avoid properties owned by First Management. They'll keep your deposit if you forget to clean one measly light-bulb fixture and if anything happens to break or stop working, you're better off paying someone to come out b/c it will be weeks, if not months, before FM actually steps in to help.  




 It's not just frat boys that participate in this sort of 'douchebagness'. If a journalist wanted to show the true impact of alcohol, dig deeper instead of asking one group of guys - and their girlfriends. 

KU has had a number of problems concerning sexual assault - date-rape drugs dispensed at parties, passing out jungle juice instead of beer....there's a long line of problems and this article didn't touch on anything besides 'hey I like to get wasted, blackout, wake up with a girl I don't remember from the night before'...and replay the next weekend.

Edit: minor typing errors

 




 Clearly they wanted to paint a perfect picture of getting plastered - bros before hoes. I posted this because I thought it was f*cking ridiculous. I've been to frat parties, I've seen what happens, and this story didn't come close to the reality that unfolds at a typical party scene.
 









 Extra dirty, please. Oh, and don't forget the olives!

 What videos would you suggest for beginners? 

My boyfriend and I are interested in doing yoga together. Unsure of where to start, I was hoping /r/yoga might have a few tips. 




 A good memory isn't necessarily genetic. It, like all forms of learning, requires repetition. 

Math is a necessity in life. Especially if you want to excel in todays world. 


Binary Coding = Math

Physics = Math

Computer Science = Math

And the basics:
Econ, Accounting, etc.


I grew up hating math because teachers used a method I never understood. Let me rephrase that. It was something I wanted to understand and would tell them that they needed to actually show me how to do it, not just tell me. It clearly wasn't something they could handle. A week after my first college math course, I finally understood what I hadn't years earlier b/c someone took the time to explain it to me in a language I finally understood. Since then I have loved math.


Also:
Instead of just teaching math, teachers should provide real-world examples of it being used. If you want a student to appreciate what they're doing, actually show how it will benefit them later on.

Edit 1: Spacing

Edit 2: Rewording 




 Or at least actually benefiting the child. My mom only used what she received to ensure we were up to date on the latest name-brand fashions.  




 They were on sale at the supermarket for about $60. 

Oh and they were served steamed with butter for dipping! :-)
 









 Groups of teenagers, sometimes younger, would walk into the store and always leave without buying anything. Took management a while to figure out why.

There were no security cameras by the condoms. They would grab several packages and leave. I was well aware of what was going on, but didn't care. 
 




 I've always set too high of standards for myself. Eventually leading to the point of seeing specialists to know why I do these things. I understand it's human nature, but when you're constantly comparing your own acheivements to others, it leads to a more depressing approach on life. 

 




 Oh hey the new line of Star Wars toys. I was so excited to see these last time I went to Petco!!! Too bad the employees weren't as amused, seeing a 20-something customer playing with dog toys! :-P 




 I know one of the rules says to not include Facebook. I chose to go against this for the fact I found her post very uplifting. By blurring out the name and pictures, I hope that will allow this post to remain on /r/pics.  




 My 'mother' used a wooden mirror. It hurt like hell.  




 From a rural part of KS here:

I was always told to call the police and ensure the individual following was, in fact, a police officer. 

Otherwise, floor it and go.  




 Ahh man, beat me to it! Props to LFK!  




 Ugh, hit me right where it hurts.

The only problem with this is the fact you have no come to the realization as to why you are unhappy. 

My childhood was a complete sh*t-hole, so finding that inner-peace as an adult hasn't come easily. I am lucky enough to have found someone whom I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. The only problem is the fact that I'm still broken, inside. 

Oh the journey's life throws our way..... 




  Being denied entrance into a national park is nothing compared to not receiving WIC disbursements in order to, you know, survive.
