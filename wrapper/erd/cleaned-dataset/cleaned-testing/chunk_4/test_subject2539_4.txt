 This could be a television show...think of all the crazy scenarios. 




 yea, they're definitely holding on to that for a while. Reigns probably involved eventually too 




 Make sure you go to harvard.edu 




 RESEARCH. If you really want to get in and you're mostly clean you will get in. MEPS is boring but its not hard. I personally got only one job offer but many others at meps had sheets of jobs to choose from. Make sure you go there with a couple of jobs in mind. 




 If you haven't read The Stand, then make sure you do. 




 ASVAB for dummies. Helped refresh some math knowledge. 




 Fuck yes, seeing these characters out in the wild is always the best 




 Do better research dude. News of this came out almost two months ago 




 That's kinda what the movie "In Time" is about. 




 It looks like a sequel to Cody Banks.. Now way this makes any good money with an R rating.  




 Best romantic film ever 




 This was the first book I ever read on my kindle. Such a great book. It reminded me of Harry Potter for no particular reason
 




 You must live in a really nice neighborhood. I did Dominos delivery for a year in a very bad neighborhood and the manager kind of hinted that the job was too dangerous for women. We had no female drivers. 




 To Pizza Hut. Drivers either dont get the delivery fee, or only get half for gas. While on delivery they also get paid less per hour. 




 How come no one has mentioned "Veep" ?  Funniest show on television. 




 Thats why im pro choice 




 Its also immensely rewatchable 




 Haven't seen that movie in ages. What was it called?

Phone Call? 




 Me too :/ 




 Paperwhite for sure. Sister has a regular kindle and is jealous of my backlight. 




 Edge of Tomorrow 




 Me too. Glad I did. 




 Weeds overrated man, especially trying it only once. The fun part about weed is becoming part of the shitty subculture and then deciding you want to do better in life.

I say just skip to the part where you want to do better in life. Try weed out in fifteen or something years when it will be legal everywhere. 




 Shit I use toilet paper 




 Not sure if its labeled as horror, but, The Road was scary. 




 yessss. Whole trilogy is almost perfect 




 11/22/63 was my first of his and since that I've read four more. Its such a great story. 




 BN.com also has this. I'm a member there so I get free shipping on all orders (dont have prime) 




 The first four Potter books, bought them with my own money in first grade. I want one of my kids to read the same copies one day.


Funny though, at the time I would write the date I started reading into the first pages. 




 Lol for real, Bahamas, Miami, poker place, running parkour fight, etc 




 They both made good money though.  




 Quantum of Solace was the most expensive film ever minute to budget wise. It was like 100 minutes long and cost $200 million. 




 Theyre both so good, but TWBB is perfect 




 So surprisingly good. Not the film I expected 




 Paige 



Paiiiiggggeeee 




 Yea , based on a novel by the same author of Trainspotting. Plus professor X is in it 




 How do promotions work? I swear I read somewhere that being promoted adds a year to your contract, is this true? In Navy DEP at the moment btw. 




 Hunter Thompson - "Heavens Hell's Angel" 




 Living in a small city, no offense to your city, but what are you really going to miss out on?


"friends were a bit hesitant saying that I should experience more things in life before jumping into such a big commitment. " your friends are just saying that because they are going to miss you, and you'll miss them. But you'll be seeing the world 




 I saw it today just knowing it was good and nothing else. Wwooorttthh it 




 What about the graphic novels? 




 She just write a new fucking book. Come on harry is in the Wizard FBI!!! There are dozens of stories to be told. DOZENS! 




 I go to AG a school next year. Hows the job? 




 Headhunters was so surprising. American adpation is in production  




 One of Finchers best. Master at adaptation. 




 I hate that the only movie I've ever seen in a non domestic theater was GI Joe in Nicaragua 




 Watching Broad City right now and I miss this. I miss smoking with friends and getting into shit. Sadly the United States military isn't fond of drug usage so its the sober life for me for at least the next four years.


Enjoy it while you can guys. 




 Yea... People say it down in Florida  




 Southern Reach was amazing. Dont think I have any questions besides, why was Southern Reach so amazing? 




 Like under $30 million domestic 




 This movie is gonna bomb hard 




 My first Vonnegut and still my favorite. I recommend Sorens of Titan second  




 Just finished reading this today actually, after three whole weeks. Idk about four films, but three could work.
Spoilers

Fist movie ends at finding Abigail

Second movie ends with hatching the spy plan

Third movie ends with Harold dead and the four men on the mission

Fourth finishes it off.

Guess it could work 




 I dont know if anyone here has ever been stuck in a waiting room for three plus hours, but this year, about two months ago, a situation arose in which i knew id be stuck on a chair in a brightly lit room with many strangers. i brouhgt Cats Cradle and finished it before days end. It was great. That again is "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut. 




 What happened in El Salvador? When from 60 something to forty something 




 Did no one give you the memo? People like to dislike things others like. Even if they liked it originally. They miss liking it when it was special to have experienced it, but when more people start experiencing it, their experience feels less important somehow. 




 Yea and hobbits dont exist 




 Hidden gem, I think I cried because of happiness  




 Harry Potter wins because most everyone in the world goes to school at least once. Very little people walk to volcanoes. Harry Potter is just more relatable. 




 A one man handicap match against the entire WWE roster? 




 I can already smell the $40 million dollar opening and $98 million final domestic total. 




 The Road: The hype is right with this one. McCarthys magnificent use of strange words almost discouraged me but i ended up reading it through one whole night.

Night Film: For fans of film and mystery this is a must read. it is long for its genre, but its great. 

The Sun Also Rises: First Hemingway I ever read and he might already be my favorite author. If you want to travel to early twentieth century south west Europe read this,
