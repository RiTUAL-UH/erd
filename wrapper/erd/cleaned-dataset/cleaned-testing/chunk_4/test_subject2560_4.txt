 I think you're probably right. The sequestering thing in particular makes a lot of sense.

I guess what I was trying to do was find a way of using the massive interconnectivity we have now that wasn't around when our systems of democracy were developed and find a way of getting citizens more involved at the very VERY bleeding edge of decision making. Without resorting to some kind of messy 'direct democracy by smartphone referendum' thing... 




 I disagree. Obviously a lot of it's nonsense but it can definitely be used to convey information in a new and perhaps more accessible way. Here's a more traditional take on that research btw http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/bees-in-danger-epidemic-of-colony-collapses-is-linked-to-stressed-out-honeybees-10034491.html 




 Don't you run all those risks with a jury as well though? And who's to say a sorority girl's opinion isn't as valid as that of anyone else. I was picturing a fairly small group, perhaps a couple of hundred, serving for a short period of time. They'd be vetted, like a jury, to remove the major security risks or anyone with an obvious bias like racist opinions or who thinks all military action should be avoided all the time.

As for security concerns, there are relatively few leaks from juries as far as I'm aware. I think the average citizen takes these things very seriously.

The justification would be making military and political leaders justify themselves to citizens each time they make a major decision, but without having to make all those decisions publicly and risk security. 




 What makes you say that? 




 That Buzzfeed is based on this study - http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3427.abstract 

It says that other pressures, like the ones you list, cause deaths in older bees and then younger bees start foraging at a younger age which causes them to die early and creates a negative feedback that collapses the colony. 




 Say the government is considering bombing a particular target. Could there be a group of people, selected in advance, like a jury, who're sent the information and asked to contribute to the discussion and vote like a cabinet or privy council do? What would the benefits, difficulties and risks be?
