 I realized how replaceable I am. Every one of my past boyfriends has gotten a new girlfriend within 2 weeks of breaking up with me or me breaking up with them. They'll act devastated and like it's the end of the world, but then just forget about me. And it's really ruining my self esteem, you know? 




 "You can go lay back down" to my dog who woke up to follow me around the house 




 And I like driving home with one headlight holla 




 I'm Anna, I'm from Michigan, and I'm in marching band and my school's robotics team. I need to meet new people so message me :3 my hobbies include talking about my pets behind their backs and sleeping 




 Low brass is obviously superior 




 Me too.. 




 My best friend's dad was an all star QB on the Michigan State football team. He got a master's in general math and a couple other maths and sciences. He is now working for a lawncare company and makes about 40k a year. 




 Ah /: And I'm in Michigan where the winters are really harsh. I just kinda want it short because it would be easier to handle and the back of my hair is pretty much fried beyond repair. 




 Lol, that's one of the best parts! 




 Oh my gosh. I am in LOVE with the first one you sent me, it's adorable (and would be so much easier to handle lol) Thanks dude! 




 I like that too, and I feel like it wouldn't look horrible if I got too lazy to straighten it lol 




 I'm getting a haircut in a couple hours, and I am going to have to get it short due to really burned hair in the back of my head, and I'll probably need it thinned out a bit. I kind of want shorter hair anyway because right now I'm getting bored with my plain haircut. I need to hear suggestions from you guys because I don't know how short or in what style or color I want. It will be difficult to decide because I have a round face which tends to not look super great with short hair. Here's a picture for reference: imgur.com/lLiTVM9 




 Hey I have that sweater 




 EVERY SINGLE DAY. 




 I've thought about this before. I would take a bus or a train to Chicago, and try to find a cheap apartment, and make a fake ID if I had to, and get a job wherever I could, and I could just live happily by myself.

 Now St. Claire is kicking our asses which sucks because we're the only band that did visuals so 




 Thank you! I just finished. It was rather hellish but ya know  




 My marching band will be in the Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, and it would mean the world to us if we won first place. If you have a minute, please go on clickondetroit.com and vote for Waterford Kettering in the side bar for the battle of the bands. We worked really hard on visuals and it would be amazing if we won first place. Thank you so much 3 




 I tried this and kinda liked it tbh, it didn't sting for me... 




 Thanks dude 




 Oh my God, I'll be there. My poor penguin has been neglected for years. 




 can i have your dress plz omg. really though where did you get it? I love it 




 http://i.imgur.com/3MnFHot.jpg hi

 My jack russell terrier mix also has that, but she doesn't gain a whole lot of weight from it, she's just a bit chubby. She has more of the problem with shaking and always being thirsty. 




 I thought I was the only one who had those 




 ITS BACK 




 I can't pick just one, but Trapeze Swinger by Iron and Wine is up there 




 This song never gets old omg 




 Southeast Michigan  




 Heck yeah! 




 That was pretty accurate lol

 "Be a brave woman!" Lol easier said than done ;P But sometimes he sits with a couple other people and they simultaneously listen to music or read and I vaguely know one of them so I might just say one day that I didn't feel like sitting with my other friends and he's the only other person in my lunch that I really know. That sounds like a decent plan but omg I'm already stressing out  




 That's so bold but omg I love it. 




 thanks riley you're great xox 




 10/10 WOULD SMILE AT. Rly tho I really wanna sit by him at lunch but it'll take a lot of courage tbh 




 I'm very introverted too, and I really like that picture. I've seen it but I read it pretty often because it reminds me of a lot of things. But someday I', gonna force myself to work up the courage to do that. 




 is it wrong i'm tempted? 




 yes i like this 









 Not with that attitude! 




 That's true, I'll ask them about it next time I see them. 




 I didn't live just with him, I lived with him and my mom until I was 3, then I saw him a few times a year and talked to him on the phone a lot because he had legal issues, but then when I turned about 11, I saw him almost every day and was with him a lot of the time. He passed away two years ago right when I turned 13. So I don't know. I'd be nervous to talk to my psychiatrist about it because I don't want to sound like one of those melodramatic teenage girls that think they have bipolar disorder, even though they're just hormones. 




 I might, I have a follow up for them in a couple weeks. I used to have a therapist but I don't go anymore because it was so expensive and I hated going. And I'm not sure, it's possible, because my dad had really severe bipolar disorder. My mom is concerned that I do, but they usually don't diagnose teenagers with it. 




 Are those song lyrics? Because wow that was adorable. Can I message you? Cuz let's be friends. I feel like you're someone I could talk to. 




 That's actually really amazing tbh 




 That made me really happy... 




 Most of my friends have aspergers actually, so don't feel bad. People who have it are actually very interesting. But I'm already on antidepressants for other reasons and they don't help much with my social issues, they just make me feel happier in general, and when I take them I have more motivation. But unfortunately, I'm still just as awkward. But thank you. 




 I wish my school had more clubs, because I agree that it would help me a lot, I'm in band but there are so many people that it's a bit overwhelming, and I'd really like smaller groups or clubs. 




 That made me smile.
