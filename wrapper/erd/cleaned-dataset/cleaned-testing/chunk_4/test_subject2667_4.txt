 I'd rather have Cubo Torres to be honest, although he wouldn't have fit with LA anyway (Keane and Zardes).  




 It's a different Juninho. [He's only in his mid-20s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitor_Gomes_Pereira_J%C3%BAnior) The one you're thinking of [did have a stint in New York but is now in Brazil.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho_Pernambucano) 




  But you're right, I live in LA, don't follow or care about the galaxy

That's a damn shame.  




 I'll be happy if he's the next Cherundolo, personally. 




 That shouldn't be too big of an issue. Our league can pay more, is more competitive and I think has more Japanese expats centralized on the west coast, although I don't think anyone would want him on the Galaxy save for Galaxy fans.  









 Both of you guys need to flair up! 




 If the dead was an Israeli non-Arab, you'd be crying. Why are you pointing out the specs in everyone else's eyes while ignoring the stick in yours?  




 Look in the mirror and take accountability of your own actions. 




 Any journalist who comes and tries to do an objective job immediately finds their life in danger. That's why we have reporting from Beirut and Skype regarding this conflict. [Serena Shim](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) is an example of what happens to the ones who try to do their job. 




 [Serena Shim of Press TV is also dead because of this fact.](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) 














 Well, people in the U.S. today, whether they are authority figures or not, are more afraid of being called racist that whether their actions are motivated by racism.  




 Actually, [New York does have a Civilian Complaint Review Board.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Complaint_Review_Board) 




 Well, is he just a temporary expat or has he immigrated for good? 




 The thing is, if you get a large enough, wealthy enough, taxpaying base moving in to an area, you'll get a more professional police force, you'll get more responsive police and you'll have an effect on the municipal government. More dollars coming in via economic activity will translate to more tax revenue.  




 Intelligence as in "mukhabarat" in this case, I think. I'm not sure on the fourth one though.  




 I laughed, although I don't think racial harmony is analogous to a failed romantic relationship.  




 How is completely separating a "let's become friends" approach? It's more like a "let's try to completely ignore each other" approach. It's almost like you're arguing for everyone to move to their native lands and for everyone to just engage in mere diplomacy. 




 Anything is better than "let's stop trying." I like how things are in the U.S. even if there is a long way to go.  




 Just like how Israelis and their apologists argue everywhere.  




 You're saying that people of different races will never get along, so we should stop trying to live near each other and cut ourselves off as soon as possible. This effectively legitimizes racism. This is the argument that white supremacist groups use today and the argument behind the segregation of old. It seems I have more faith in humanity than you do to live together with equality regardless of race. 




 You can't be racist if you don't see the other race. Brilliant!  




 Don't judge a book by its cover; don't judge an article by the headline.  




 Those areas, back then, didn't become affluent until the middle class white families moved in.  




 I don't agree with that for a second. You're effectively arguing that the only way different races can treat each other as equals is if they wall each other off. That's not an end to racism, that's an embrace of it.  




 You're kidding, right? The whole article is about racism in an Eastern European country. I've seen other stories about how people with darker skin in Eastern Europe are very fearful.  




 Buffalo doesn't get Canadian channels? I'd be surprised if they didn't.  




  OK. Let's say Spain was had underwent a complete process of Arabization and Islamization. By the 10th century the majority of people on the Iberian peninsula would be Arabic-speaking Iberian Muslims (Muwalladun), the minority actual Arabs or Berbers. Eventually the Muwalladun could have expelled their Arab overlords, but they would not have been able to reclaim their Romance languages. 

Didn't this actually happen?  




 "My brother and I against my cousin, my cousin and I against the world" 




 I'm pretty sure the Quran says there were Jews in Egypt too.  




  we're just on a break

I wonder how long the "emergency rule" will last this time.  









 Never mind that the site he posted from is actually run by Jewish people. 




 If they're in America, that will change soon on their part. Every recent immigrant takes some time to get out of their shell.  




 In the 1950s and 60s, after Jim Crow laws were repealed and schools were desegregated, many white families left cities with high black populations and left to the suburbs rather than live alongside black people or have their children go to school with black children. This, coupled with discriminatory housing laws on the books until the 1980s in some cases, has led to a de facto segregation in many areas across the United States. 

Good example of this here, if you have a half hour to spare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp22YlJlfHo

If you look at a racial breakdown on a map of a major metropolitan area, you'll see stark differences in the racial makeup of certain areas.  









 I think America would benefit from people self-segregating less.  




 Well, he didn't even offer any evidence himself, he just made an arbitrary statement, unlike you, who actually post a link.  




 The author writes about the racism he experienced while living in Ukraine, saying that the people overall were aware of racism and eager to learn more, unlike his experiences in the United States.  









 Or if Vince didn't think he looks "ratty." 




 If he is coming here, it's going to be in LA or NY. I'm not sure he would want to come to a small town (maybe he would for the diminished attention), and the league definitely doesn't want a celebrity like that playing in a small media market.  




 No, we played Bayern Munich in Portland, how did you forget?  




 What's wrong with that?
