 it aint really what it is but it do 




 shit starts spinnin' 




 This article was great! I don't post much, but I just wanted to stop in and show my appreciation for an article of such quality.

It is truly unfortunate that static recompilation is difficult to use more extensively in emulation due to the inherent complexity of code.

Very good read though, it's clear that you put a lot of work into the article. Thanks for sharing. 




 MD MoCo ent reporting. Nice spot 




 Get this superstitious bullshit off world news. Stories like this contribute nothing to this sub and you should feel bad. 




 Theories of Relativity and Special Relativity by Einstein. Nobody even came close to understanding gravity before this. The 20th century is great. 




 Can someone please explain to me why anyone even cares about these statistics? I don't understand, why is it significant if less women go into a field one year compared to past years? And why does it belong in this sub? 




 Competitive SSBM ent here. Sick controller. 




 Does that just mean that no one has been able to prove it's either P or NP-complete? 




 If this is OC and you're really asking, good luck man. 




 Razors. Those fuckers are expensive 




 How about "pick one programming paradigm and stick to it"? 




 As human beings, I feel like we strive to attach meaning to inherently meaningless things. It's sad, really. The way humans live life today is just an endless circlejerk with some escapism thrown in for shits and giggles. 




 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beeeer... etc. 




 Long term medication is a scary concept. Ive been on medication for around 7 years (growing up) and I can assure you it changes your personality. In my case, I feel overwhelmingly neutral whenever a conflict comes up. I have trouble feeling anything at all and as a result I'm terrible with women. I have never had a girlfriend even though I'm outgoing and have a decent amount of good friends. I am very critical of things that I don't agree with and I criticize those that don't understand certain situations like I do. Stay away from medication in the long term if you can. This sucks. 




 Alcohol can often make things harder instead of easier. There are some medications out there that will make you feel better, you just have to go to a therapist/psychiatrist to get help. Falling asleep with so much pain is terrible. If you have someone in your life who is willing to listen, talking to them will definitely help. It is the main reason i can keep from being so depressed, along with my medication. In any case, good luck with your life and try to decrease the drinking to weekends if you can. 




 Speaking from experience: try to sit down with her and tell her how you really feel about this and any concerns you have. In any functional relationship, both sides listen to one another's concerns and make their thoughts and opinions known to each other. 




 The way I think of it: if you give people a chance, they will give you a chance. You may find that when it's their turn to reciprocate the kindness you showed to them, they will show that they care about you. 




 The world can be hard to understand. I've tried making the best of life by setting short term goals for myself like attending every class at college and going to every shift at work. It's still very hard but at least I know I'm on the right track. Setting goals can help. 




 Sometimes you have to be the one to reach out to others in your life. Maybe if you try to reconnect with others, you will be able to feel better. This is what happened with me and having people around me helps a lot. 




 My Pots on Thought lol 




 Just let go of her, she's holding you back. You can be so much more. 




 Depression is unique because there are so many ways we experience it. I am currently in the same boat as you. Most of high school I was stepped on. You just have to keep on living. Friends were a valuable resource when i finally found some real ones. This community is also great because we can let our feelings be known and not feel so alone. Sorry if this post isnt really making a point, I'm just greatful this subreddit is here as much as you. 




 If you're in college, try to find things in common with people in your classes. I was depressed before and now I have a small group of friends with common interests and we all support each other. It is very hard at first, but just try to chat people up. At uni most people are nice and will listen, unlike high school. I wish you luck, hope my advice was ok. 




 I understand, i do this with pop tarts. What i do to help is study for 30 mins then take a break and eat. Then repeat. I'm a uni student by the way. 




 Yeah i wanna know too but im lazy and google is so far away. Marylents unite! 




 I would imagine they are attempting to move heavy objects, given the crane. I hope this clears up any questions you may have had. 




 uptokes for tries lol
