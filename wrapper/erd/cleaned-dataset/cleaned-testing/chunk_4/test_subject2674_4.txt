 I hope that Prairie Cycle also plans to submit a letter to editor to News-Gazette in response to this piece, so that the readership of N-G can see these points as well. 




 Thank you for doing this AMA, Dr. Perlak.

If you could return to the time when GMO technology was first emerging, with the general public as blank slate, what might companies like Monsanto do differently to market GMOs, to educate the public about what they are and their risks and benefits?  Is there one broadly held misconception about genetic/genomic editing that you would most like to eradicate, to help the public make informed decisions about the pros and cons of GMO crops? 




 I am right there with you my friend.

Good reminder to me to go do leg raises and clamshells and weep softly to myself.

 Every book (or even every book I like) doesn't need to be deeply philosophical and nuanced.  I read for escapism sometimes too.  But I guess the fan hype is exactly what bothers me, and I think it's what the OP's original question was about.

As to the author's intent, here's a quote from an interview he did with Conan: "I want my readers, and i want viewers to be afraid when my characters are in danger," he adds. "I want them to be afraid to turn the next page because the next character may not survive it."

If I were a fiction writer (which I fully admit I don't have the skill to be, not even a really bad one) I would aspire to have my readers fear for the safety of my characters because they empathize with them so much, not because they've observed a 75% mortality rate among relatively non-evil characters and they're intuiting the math.

Edit: And also, honor is a fault now?  You just can't win for losin' . . .   :-) 




 Fair point, I have not.

Briefly stated, my issue with ASOIAF (I actually read all the books so far, in a really over the top attempt to give them a fair shake and understand why my BF likes them) is not the violence per se, although I know this is the issue for many who dislike them.  It's that although the plot is exciting and full of cliff-hangers, I just don't get the sense of a lot of thought or meaning behind them.  No genuine reflection on human nature, philosophy, or the way the world works.  If characters die, it shouldn't be as a "gotcha" at the reader.  If a despicable character suddenly shows a more empathetic side, it should feel genuine, not like a plot twist for the sake of surprise.  This might be unfair to Martin, it's just my subjective experience.

Are his short stories substantially different in style?  If it's just that novel-writing or sudden mega-fame changed his writing a lot, I'd be interested to give them a shot just for the heck of it.

Please don't hurt me . . . I feel so alone. 




 Also, although the discovery of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was revolutionary (and very controversial) when discovered, it is no longer new (over three decades old), although its study in relation to memory remains very exciting.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229390335D 




 I'm not trying to say it isn't exciting, just that its novelty and interpretation are being overstated.

The resource I cite is one of many that have established in vivo imaging of dendritic spines.  This research has improved ability to image deeper brain structures repeatedly in vivo, but they are building on a lot of previous work, including the study I cited.  It's a great improvement, but not a revolution.

The hippocampus is important, but it's the "golden child" for a lot of researchers, in a way that leads to unrealistic models of how the brain works.  To say that it's "particularly" important compared to the cortex sounds biased to me.  The cortex is hugely important.  So are primary sensory processing centers.  To make kind of a quibbling argument, for example, you wouldn't have a lot of auditory memory without ears, no matter how healthy your hippocampus is.

Again, this work is important.  It just doesn't prove for the first time that synapses store memories, and it's being discussed (and portrayed as surprising) in the context of a biased way of viewing the brain. 




 As I understand it, this is where the active edge of our understanding/ongoing research is.

It does seem consistent with what we know that more senses involved in a memory, or more unique associations between it and other experiences or ideas, makes it more robust.  The way I envision this (which might not be actually correct) is that to remember something, you need to re-activate one of the circuits that represents the idea.  The more neural pathways are connected with that circuit, the more possible routes to recall you have, and even if some are destroyed, you could still be prompted by some stimuli to remember part or all of the idea. 




 Apparently, almost all insect species will die if they are exposed to prolonged heat above ~105-120 degrees F/40-50 degrees C.

I'm not sure exactly how size would come into play.  Smaller size might mean more rapid dehydration, but that would also depend on how that type of insect respires, how well its exoskeleton retains moisture, its color etc.  What cooling strategies the insect has, and how resistant its physiology is to overheating, would also matter. 




 In general, yup, that is the theory.  The idea is that there's a sort of "natural selection" for synapses in the brain--connections that are used often are maintained, and those that are not used often will eventually weaken and disappear.

This is even more true in developing brains, but even in adult brains, new possible connections are continually being formed, and then either discarded or retained depending on how active they are. 




 Of course it can.  But this current study did not specifically demonstrate that the synapses they imaged were involved in encoding a memory either.  Their argument is only that they showed the synapses can last for the same time frame as a long-term memory. 




 The researchers did some important work, but they weren't the first ones to prove that synapses can last a long time in the brain.  They showed it for a different region of the brain than past research has focused on.

Another issue I have with this reporting of the work, and to some extent with the way the study is framed, is that they are building up the importance by linking it to a way of thinking about memory that I think is overly simplistic.  The dogma in the field is that the hippocampus, one brain region associated with memory, holds short-term memories, and these memories get "transferred" to the cortex, another part of the brain, to make them long-term.  It's one working model of how memories are represented in the brain, but in reality, it's much more likely that memories, especially the strong, long-lasting ones, involve changes in synapse placement and strength at all levels of processing--from the neurons that perceive sensory input, all the way up to the cortex, and even back out to motor neurons that direct movement. 




 It looks like there might be a few studies showing a correlation between the two, for example: http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/01/20/0886260512471081.abstract

However, I think it would be really hard to prove causation.  It seems pretty likely that homosexuality or bisexuality would increase an individual's risk of being targeted for abuse in childhood and adolescence.

What an incredibly heartbreaking topic. 




 Social insects have a lot of neat adaptations to keep their nest spaces cool.  For example, the placement and angles of tunnels in a termite mound facilitate air flow and cooling:http://www.planetseed.com/relatedarticle/cool-termites

Honey bees will forage for water on hot days, spread the water on the wax combs, and fan their wings to cool the hive via evaporation.

Other insects may cool themselves with water, shade, dormancy during hot periods, or other adaptations.
