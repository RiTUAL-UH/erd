 And suddenly everything feels itchy. 




 Of course, Knotty! 




 I wish I knew. My gut tells me that the same planes that destroyed my home town might have dropped the dust. They moved fast...and over the black sky, they could easily be mistaken for shooting stars. The music was loud: I wouldn't be surprised if none of us heard them. 




 Maybe you're right...I mean, worst case scenario, I find out he was behind it. I kind of want to keep on pretending, but the thought that it was him still lingers in my head. Either what I read will clear his name, or confirm my worst fears. 




 I had a rough go for a while, especially during my college years. I was fortunate enough to have a really great school counsellor who recommended I go talk to a colleague of his. 




 Time to write a contest entry, I guess :P

I believe you meant to say: "Time to write a story THAT WILL CRUSH AND ANNIHILATE ALL OTHER ENTRIES IN ITS AWESOMENESS."

But I understood you either way. You get'em, Knotty!
 




 I got a similar message last month for the February contest, and looked her up. From what I recall, she's a leader at nanowrimo and a mod at that website. Everything looked legit to me. 




 I never thought of it that way...the pneumonia did start after I spent a weekend at his cabin.

It was annoying, but I was a kid. Things always bothered me less as a child. Cold water, for instance. I can't stand swimming in a cold lake nowadays, but when I was a kid, I'd jump right in without hesitating. 




 When I was a young girl, I lived in the town of Tadaldak, just outside Whitesand Provincial Park in Northern Ontario. It was a small community, not found on any map. On the night of the meteor shower in 1981, Tadaldak went from a lively town of around 2 000 residents, to ashes scattered across the woodlands. I was the only survivor.

 nbsp;

Tadaldak was a beautiful town filled with rustic-looking houses built with wood from the surrounding forest. Our homes had much more spirit to them than any of the mass-produced condos I've lived in since. I'm not preaching about colors of the wind or anything like that: I just appreciate genuine human craftsmanship. Due to Tadaldak's secluded location, there was no way in or out of town, except for an ice road that appeared only in the coldest months of winter. Because of this, it was impossible to get supplies, so we had to be self-sustaining. Most of us knew how to hunt and fish, so we were never in danger of starvation.

 nbsp;

Though our supply of fresh fruits and vegetables was limited, we found every excuse to indulge. That's how the Starlight Festival came to be. In mid August, the town got together to celebrate week-long meteor showers that took place every year.

 nbsp;

As summer drew to an end and preparations for the festival began, I came down with pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. All day long, I watched from the window as the area transformed. Paper streamers were hung along town square, benches were installed, and food stands were rolled into place. Every night, when I saw the first star in the sky, I made a wish that I would get better in time for the festivities.

 nbsp;

By the first day of the festival, I was feeling much better, but I was still stuck on oxygen. I nagged and begged the nurses to release me, giving them my most irresistible pair of puppy-dog eyes. Finally, the doctor agreed to let me out, under three conditions: I had to carry a portable oxygen tank, I had to be accompanied by a nurse, and I had to come straight back to the hospital once the meteor shower was over. I was thrilled beyond words.

 nbsp;

A few hours later, I was sitting in the crowd as lively music blared through old speakers set up around town square. Nurse Jesse was kind enough to sit with me while my parents watched from a few rows back. The scent of fried food and sweets  a rare treat in our neck of the woods  filled my nostrils, and I excitedly looked from food stand to food stand, wondering if there was enough room in my stomach to try everything. One by one, the lights in the town turned off, as the sun descended onto the horizon. The sky was clear, welcoming the dim remnants of lights from far-away galaxies.

 nbsp;

"Ooooooooo!", uttered the crowd, as the celestial show began.

 nbsp;

Lights streamed above us as hundreds of shooting stars made their way across the heavens. I sat in awe, grateful that I was there to see the show. Then, something unusual happened: shimmering speckles began falling from the sky. My immediate thought was that forest fairies were blessing our festival by spreading pixiedust into the crowd. The scene looked enchanted, and I lifted my hands to try and catch the magical substance, thinking it would imbue me with the ability to fly. The powder was thick and weightless, like soot from a campfire. It dissolved as I manipulated it between my fingers. The stardust fell faster, covering us like a winter storm. I could hear people around me coughing, sneezing, and wheezing. A sudden twinge of guilt came over me, as it occurred to me that I might have infected everyone with pneumonia.

 nbsp;

Wind blew the speckles of stardust away, but the crowd became even more agitated than before. I could see fear in their eyes, which, in turn, frightened me. Never had I seen so many adults look so disturbed, yet I had no idea why they were scared. I turned to nurse Jesse for comfort, hoping he knew what was going on, but what I saw sent me into full blown panic: the whites of his eyes had turned red, and blood leaked from every orifice on his head. I started sobbing and let out a muffled scream, fog forming in my mask. Nurse Jesse hacked loudly, clawing at his throat until his nails drew blood. Moments later, he fell over lifelessly. I screamed for help, but my weakened voice could not break through the agonized sounds around me. I turned to my parents, but they were already on the floor, bleeding. I saw hundreds of friends, family, and neighbors succumb to the same fate. Silence replaced the chaos. I wished I could hear their screams again, because the silence scared me more. The silence meant it was over.

 nbsp;

Tears clouding my vision, I tried to get up so I could find help. My oxygen tank had gotten wedged between Nurse Jesse and the bench, locking me in place. Snot leaked into my mouth, but I couldn't wipe it away because the mask was in the way. Having been given strict orders not to remove it, I dealt with the uncomfortable salty taste. I tugged at my tether, finally yanking myself free. When I saw Nurse Jesse's blood smeared along the silver canister, I started howling like a voice-neutered banshee.

 nbsp;

Thanks to my parents, I knew to seek help in an emergency. I rotated the oxygen tank onto its wheels, and started walking towards the only logical place: the hospital. If anyone could help, it was the doctors and nurses. My lungs were on fire as I inched my way across town. I had to deviate from my path many times to avoid stepping on the sick townsfolk. I was too young to tell whether they were dead or alive. I was going to be the hero who saved Tadaldak.

 nbsp;

I felt drained by the time I reached the hospital, but a wave of relief gave me a second wind, and I ran inside. It was far too quiet in the hospital. My insides twisted as I walked around the corner and saw the bodies on the ground, faces painted in streams of blood. I ran over and shook Nurse James, begging her to wake up, but her cold body remained unresponsive.

 nbsp;

Once reality set in, I started bawling loudly, and curled up in the corner. I kept telling myself I had to be a big girl: I had to make everyone better again. I was going to be the hero who saved Tadaldak. I repeated those words over and over in my head until they gave me enough strength to stand up. If the doctors and nurses couldn't help, then I had to go farther. My grandpa lived alone in the woods. He'd know what to do. I knew the way there, but it was going to be hard to reach him while carrying the oxygen tank.

 nbsp;

I had barely made it to the outskirts of town when I heard a distant rumbling. My flight-or-fight instinct suddenly kicked in, and I ripped the oxygen mask off my face so I could bolt into the woods as fast as my little feet could take me. As I hid under a maple tree, I saw a black, low-flying plane rip through the treetops and towards my home. It was followed by two more.

 nbsp;

I watched as hellfire rained down on my peaceful hometown. A strong wave of heat rippled through the air, and pushed me to the ground. I could smell Tadaldak burning from the short distance separating us. Ambers flew in every direction, twirling and dancing in the breeze. Pockets of warm air swelled through the foliage, making the landscape rattle like the chains of death. A mix of emotions overwhelmed me: desperation, worry, sorrow, confusion, and anxiety. I couldn't function, and didn't know what to do, except to stay right where I was as a raging fire took away all that I had ever known. I wasn't going to be a hero. I wasn't going to save Tadaldak. It was already too late.

 nbsp;

The planes came back for a second assault, though I doubt there was anything left to shoot. Before long, they streaked away in the horizon, like shooting stars.

 nbsp;

I'm not sure how long I hid in the bushes, sobbing to myself, but I remember what snapped me back to reality. From a short distance, I saw a bipedal, cloaked form with two bulging glassy eyes. I had heard legends of wraiths hiding in the woods, and thought that was precisely what I was looking at. I burrowed into a bush, hiding from and spying on the creature. Then, I heard it speak to another of its kind. I'll never forget what they said, nor the horrifyingly ordinary sound of their voices.

 nbsp;

"Get them all?", asked the first.

 nbsp;

"Yeh. Threw em in the fire with the others.", replied the second.

 nbsp;

They sounded human. I held back a whimper and made myself as small as possible, hoping beyond hope that they wouldn't hear my labored breathing. I knew they were going to hurt me if they found me.

 nbsp;

I honestly can't remember how I did it, but I eventually made it to my grandfather's place. I told him everything that happened while he peacefully consoled me. After that night, he took me in and raised me. Eventually, I grew up and moved out of the region. I visited him once in a while, but I couldn't stand being so close to the scar in the landscape, so my visits were few and far between.

 nbsp;

My grandfather died not too long ago. As his next of kin, I was tasked with handling his affairs. I took a trip to his cabin to clear out his things. In his attic, I found a locked wooden crate with ornate detailing. I wanted to take it with me, and searched all over the house for its key, without success. Eventually, I took the box to a locksmith, who was kind enough to unlock it for me. In the crate, I saw the big glassy eyes of a gas mask starring back at me. It sat on a bed of news clippings and file folders marked "Operation Ta'xet". I was too afraid to read what they said. I'd rather live the rest of my life pretending my grandfather wasn't involved with the obliteration of my hometown. 




 I laughed so hard my cat fell out of my lap. 




 You performed your monthly ritual, right? It should be OK. 




  Mods aren't omniscient beings that know every instance of rule breaking that occurs across the thousands of stories posted.

Waitthey're NOT?!
 




 Yeh. I wish we'd gone to the Museum of Nature instead. At least then, I'd have been able to look at the frogs...and draw the frogs really badly. 




 I really wanted to live there, but I couldn't take the plunge. Maintaining this place was too much of a drain. 




 Ugh! Don't you just hate it when that happens? 




 xD; Well, that's embarrassing. 




 For you, I'll throw them in for free. 




 I wish. 




 Is 150 000$ too steep? 




 Construction on my brand new condo finished this summer. Not wasting a second, I broke lease on my musky apartment, and moved in as soon as possible. I rather enjoyed knowing I was the first resident living here: there was no wear and tear, no smoke stains on the walls, and no damage to the structure. The only issue was a light clattering sound whenever I used the commercial sink in my laundry room. I rarely used it, so I didn't bring up the problem to the contractors. Everything else worked perfectly, and my home was as sterile as an operating table.

 nbsp;

After a few months, I began noticing water pooling at the foot of my shower. The drain must have been clogged. I took to my tools, unscrewed the shower drain, and peered inside. I could see a collection of fibers bunched up in the pipes. Reaching in with an unfolded coat hanger, I pulled out mountains of dirty blond hair clogging the pipes. I live alone, I don't have any pets, I haven't entertained a lady in over a year, and I've been bald since I was 27.

 nbsp;

The odd phenomena got me thinking about the sink in the laundry room. I detached the aerator, placed my hand under the faucet, and turned on the water. Dozens of molars came flying out, slipping through my fingers and into the sink, bouncing up and down until ultimately falling down the drain.

 nbsp;

On a completely unrelated note: I have a beautiful, fully furnished, barely-used condo for sale. Located in downtown Detroit. Anyone interested? 




 While we're on the topic, seems like [This guy]( https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Asylum/1588112608089682) right here is doing something similar. The weird thing is, he does mention in a few posts that he read said story on Reddit (though does not link back to the original), yet in about 90% of the cases, they're flat-out stolen.

Seems this one 




 I would love to! 




 Oh we can be much *much* tighter, if you'd like





Let me get the ropes.

*Wuahahahahah!* 




 The stepfather likes to keep his handcuffs where they belong: the bedroom. 




 Ooh, I got it backwards. Hmm...I swear, some people are shameless. 




 Yeah, those flags would be great. 




 I find that most Youtube narrators do not ask for permission, but do link back to the original story. Are you saying that Mr.CreepyPasta covered some of yours but linked back to the thief's website? If so, you can probably message him and have him give you credit instead. 




 If it helps, I'm perfectly fine with maintaining a viewable table of authors and their preferred licensing models.

That's a pretty good idea. It could probably be added to the table on the author's non-nosleep pages. I do get the feeling that most people won't bother looking before they take the material, though. Still, for the ones who typically take the time to ask for permission, it'd be a nice resource. 




 Brilliant. This is one of those stories that will definitely stick with me. 




 She was bitten by one just a few months ago, so he's not going to turn unless she decides to give him a nibble. 




 That's actually a brilliant idea. They'll know they blew their cover. Maybe it'll be enough to get them off my case. 




 Fair point, though in my head, the kid's not an emo. I suppose it should have been: "My mom thinks I'm emo because I have these cuts."

Y'know, parents are always throwing the wrong labels out there. Wear a leather bracelet, and they think you're a punk. Sacrifice a goat or two, and suddenly you're a Satanist. Silly parents. 




 That's hilarious! 




 Thank you! :) 




 Thanks. It was seriously supposed to be the stepfather. He's a teenager: he doesn't have a father-in-law. Fixed the post. 




 ARGH, thanks for catching that. It's supposed to be his stepfather. Must have had a brainfart. 




 Mom freaked out when she saw the cuts on my arms last month. She thought I was hurting myself. My stepfather was too much of a prick to tell her the truth. He stood in the corner, arms crossed, watching as she gripped me by the shoulders and tried to literally shake some sense into me. Even as she bawled her eyes out, holding me close to her and begging me not to hurt myself any more, the man kept his stupid ass mouth shut. He shot me this threatening look so I'd do the same.

 nbsp;

Mom set up an emergency counseling session. After a few weeks, when she saw that no new cuts had appeared, she wholeheartedly thanked the therapist for saving my life. Meanwhile, her husband did what he always does: he played dumb.

 nbsp;

She'll be so disappointed in me tomorrow morning, when she finds her claw marks all over me again. It'd be so much easier if we tied her up on the full moon. 




 Well...shit. Now I really regret signing those papers. 




 On a recent school trip, I visited the Central Experimental Farm, run by the Research branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. To me, the term "experimental farm" has always sounded ominous as hell. I pictured mutated livestock, chimeras, man-eating grain machines, and all sorts of creepy shit. Even though I was told experimental farms were just places where researchers tested out new techniques and equipment, I wasn't entirely convinced. Turns out, I was right to be suspicious.

 nbsp;

Before the start of the winter semester, I was informed that I needed to take a complementary course. There were three options: mid-century philosophy, sports psychology, and drawing class. Thinking I'd get to see a ton of hot nudes, I went for drawing class. Once the semester started; however, I quickly realized that the only melons I was going to see were in a fruit bowl. Week after week, I wasted away three hours of my life drawing inanimate objects while listening to a monotone snob drone on about contrast and texture or some shit like that. It was horrendously boring.

 nbsp;

One day, our professor announced he was planning a field trip to the Central Experimental Farm across town so we could draw live plants. He made arrangements with the various professors of classes taking place after his own, so students would spend a whole three hours at the location. I, on the other hand, had a spare after drawing class, so I wasn't exactly thrilled that I was going to lose a large chunk of homework time on traveling to and from the facility. Attendance was mandatory, so I had no choice but to follow along.

 nbsp;

Hitching a ride with a fellow student, I arrived at the experimental farm bright and early. From the outside, the place didn't look quite as disturbing as I had imagined. Three large greenhouses were situated at a central location between four snow-covered fields. Nested against the farthest greenhouse was a tall brown office building. Researchers probably did their work in there. In the summer, crops were grown using different methods in each of the fields, and then tested to see which worked best. As far as I could tell, there wasn't any livestock. I couldn't even see a traditional farmhouse on the property. I began thinking I'd sorely overestimated the creep factor of the place: everything looked normal.

 nbsp;

Once the teacher showed up, an employee escorted us into one of the greenhouses. I was amazed by the change of atmosphere when I stepped through a set of plastic strips separating the entranceway from the inside. Where the world had been cold and dry moments before, it was now warm, humid, and brimming with life. A variety of plants filled the semi-circular shelter, creating its own unique ecosystem. There were tall palm trees hanging over bushes, flowerbeds floating atop a pond, and even cucumbers growing upside-down on a fenced mesh. We were given freedom to explore the greenhouse and draw what ever tickled our fancy. I roamed about until I found a plant that looked kind of badass across a stream full of koi. I had brought a digital camera to take reference pictures in case I didn't have time to finish my drawing, so I quickly snapped a shot of the plant, before I began drawing it.

 nbsp;

I'm no Picasso, so it didn't surprise me when my drawing went from a somewhat accurate outline, to a piece of shit. Thinking the plant I'd chosen was too advanced' for me, I abandoned my spot, and went about looking for an easier alternative. It was during this search that I came across a narrow passageway connecting the main greenhouse to the next. A set of plastic strips hung from a doorframe to the second greenhouse. I could clearly see the words "Employees only" marked in red above the door. Glancing around to make sure no one was watching, I ignored the sign and went inside. Why would I bother respecting their little warning, if they weren't even going to bother locking that shit up?

 nbsp;

The air was much thicker inside the second greenhouse, and I could see a drastic change in the types of plants within it. This greenhouse had a tropical rainforest feel to it. The foliage was lush and the plant life was foreign to me. I walked around the area cautiously, keeping my ears open for the sound of footsteps. I took photos of everything I saw. One plant in particular, at the very back of the greenhouse, piqued my interest. It was unlike anything I had ever seen in my life: its stem was purple and branched out into light blue, it was covered in tiny razor-sharp thorns that were barely visible to the naked eye, and it had clusters of plump red strawberries dangling from its leafy ends. I took several pictures of the unique plant. The fruit growing from it looked and smelled amazing, like a basket of fresh berries in the middle of summer. I couldn't resist.

 nbsp;

As I reached for one of the strawberries, I nicked my forearm on one of its thorns. My arm went completely numb almost instantaneously, like when you fall asleep on it and wake up to find it limp as a wet noodle. Heck, I couldn't even feel the bones holding it in place. It was as though the entire limb had turned into jello. The numbing sensation spread to the rest of my body. Before I even knew what was happening, I was laying on the floor with the plant towering over me. I was scared, and tried to call for help, but my tongue felt swollen and my words came out as incoherent babbling, like after a visit to the dentist. My vision began to blur and darken around the edges. I'm not sure if it was an optical illusion, but I could have sworn I saw a purple vine slithering towards me as I lay there paralyzed. I was certain I was going to die and, though I was terrified, I was thankful it was painless. The world around me disappeared, and I found myself feeling as though I was floating in the abyss.

 nbsp;

A splash of cold water hit my face, bringing me back to the land of the living. I opened my eyes, only to see a bright shining light directly in front of me. I groaned and turned my head. As far as I could tell, I was no longer in the greenhouse. It was dark and cold. Every inch of my body prickled as my sense of touch came back little by little. I heard something, like the distant and muffled sound of someone shouting. Another splash of water, and I awoke fully. I gasped for air, screaming in pain. My body ached in places I didn't even know existed. It didn't help that I was sitting on an uncomfortable wooden chair, but I think I'd have been in as much agony on a futon anyways.

 nbsp;

As I sat there, confused, scared, and in a great amount of physical distress, I began trying to make out my surroundings. I was definitely in a room: the walls were close to me. If I'd had enough strength to stretch my arm out, I probably would have been able to touch them. I could barely make out the outline of two men standing behind the spotlight in front of me. One by one, they started barking questions at me, like I was some kind of criminal on one of those cop shows. I could barely understand what they were saying, let alone formulate the syllables needed to answer them. They grilled me for hours, and as time passed, I was finally able to respond. I tried telling them I was a student on a field trip and got turned around, but they wouldn't listen to me. They just went on and on, until I broke down and started crying. My eyes were burning, but the tears eased some of the pain. I felt absolutely helpless. I wanted to go home.

 nbsp;

I think those sick fucks were waiting for me to break down, because they dimmed the spotlight not long after, and pushed a piece of paper over to me. Up until that moment, I hadn't even realized there was a table in front of me. Good thing I didn't try kicking them in the nuts like I wanted to. Not that I would have been able to if I tried: I was so sore, it felt like I'd been body checked by three hockey players at once. I couldn't think clearly, not with the men impatiently screaming at me, waving their hands at the piece of paper. I signed. I don't even know what the paper said, but I signed the fucking thing. The men toned down their aggression afterwards.

 nbsp;

Finally, I was pulled to my feet by one of the men. He was big, buff, and looked like some kind of security guard or something. He took me to a car waiting outside. By then, it was night, and I wondered how they'd justified my absence to my professor. Hadn't anyone wondered where I'd been? I was too emotionally and physically drained to say anything during the ride home. Frankly, I'm not even sure I gave the driver my address. He just kind of knew where to go. He stopped in front of my house, opened the back door, glared at me, and threatened that I'd be in big trouble if I told anyone what had happened. Fuck that shit. You're reading this now, so clearly I didn't listen to him.

 nbsp;

Later that night, as I was resting in bed, I remembered my camera. By then, my body was still a little sore, but felt much better. My left arm still felt odd, though. I could barely move it, and the skin on it was numb. Using only my good arm, I looked through my things, and found the digital camera in my backpack. I flicked the switch, trying to find a photo of the plant. I wanted to look it up online. The SD card was empty. They deleted EVERYTHING, even the photos I took a month ago and never got around to transferring. They were all gone.

 nbsp;

It's been a few days, and my arm's still not working quite right. It moves slowly, and my muscles are sore like when you start lifting weights after a long break. I'm pretty sure those dudes are watching me, because there's this car outside my house at all times. When I leave home, it follows me from a distance. I managed to give them the slip today. I snuck out the back door and went straight to the library. I'm posting this via a public computer so they can't trace that shit back to me. I don't know what they want or what they'll do if they found out I talked. Either way, I needed to tell someone. There's some real weird shit going on at the experimental farm. What ever they're doing there, it's not normal. 




 Oh my, how fortuitous! 




 Hmm? 




 Like the others pointed out, there's /r/nosleepteams, where a single story is co-written by a team of writers. But there are also series where different parts have been posted by separate writers, like the famous [All In Good Time](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepOOC/comments/2keyy5/list_of_stories_involving_all_in_good_time_or/) series. Every section is kind of stand-alone, yet goes together. 




 Funny thing is, it actually wasn't. I tried signing in using 'password' as a password, but nada. Fortunately, the lovely admins reset everything and I was ultimately able to sign up again with a real password this time. 




 RIP jogger, RIP. 




 To me, the most disturbing part of this is thinking about you taking care of Brambles' litterbox. 




 Yeah, definitely not my brightest moment. I figured out that "email" had to be changed to one's email address. It just didn't occur to me that "password" was a variable, too. I kicked myself for that one. Hahaha. 




 Protip: Don't be like me and moronically assume it's a command to receive an email to set up a password. You have to input the password you want in there. 




 FIDDLESTICKS AND FUDGESICLES. Nope. NOPE. NOPE. 




 In my case, I never received an email. It just kind of worked. 




 I'd feel a lot better if he was, but I don't think so. 




 When I was in high school, my friends and I had a peculiar pastime. Like any teenage delinquent, we liked to cause trouble. We weren't vandals, we didn't deal drugs, and we certainly didn't bully kids in school. No, we liked to scare the living shit out of new parents by "hacking" their baby monitors. We were insufferable little punks who thought we were too good to get caught, and that our little acts of mischief would go unpunished. One night; however, I learned my lesson, and realized that I wasn't quite as bulletproof as my tremendous adolescent ego made me out to be.

 nbsp;

Dimitri, Kurt, and I went to the same school, shared many of the same classes, and hung out almost every evening after chow time. We watched prank shows, played video games, talked about who had the nicest rack in school. One evening, we were trading scary stories at the park. Kurt shared the classic story about the single mother who heard a haunting voice on her baby monitor. Like most horror stories, it sounded like total bullshit, but Dimitri told us it had happened to his mom once. On her own monitor, she'd heard a neighbour singing to her baby. Apparently, it was possible to accidentally tap into someone else's frequency. In an instant, a lightbulb turned on in each of our heads. When you're close enough to someone, you don't need words to know what that person is thinking, and we could all tell we were thinking the exact same thing: we were going to buy a baby monitor and screw with people.

 nbsp;

Pardon the pun, but hacking a baby monitor is child's play. All you need to do is find a device on the same frequency as yours. Never one to do things half-assed, I purchased a high-end monitor with a frequency dial so we could prank as many targets as possible. The following night, we took to our bikes, roamed the neighbourhood, and found our first victim. We could see the nursery from the suburban home's second floor window. Dimitri grabbed the baby monitor and began tuning it to different frequencies, until we heard breathing. I remember feeling excited as our plan finally came to fruition. Dimitri pressed the button, and began exhaling heavily into the receiver.

 nbsp;

"yourlittle girlwasdelicious", he murmured, using a demonic voice.

 nbsp;

The light in the master bedroom turned on almost immediately, and we heard a shrill scream. Laughing our asses off, we quickly rode off down the street so we wouldn't get caught.

 nbsp;

We repeated the prank several times over the course of the following weeks, each taking turns talking through the monitor. Not wanting anyone to get wise to our little game, we chose different houses every time. People's reactions were priceless: some mothers would reply in a panic, others seemed to know it was a hoax and told us to shut up, and one poor woman even started sobbing uncontrollably, begging us not to hurt her baby. I feel bad about that last one now that I'm older, but it was hilarious to me back then. My friends and I mimicked her high-pitch bawling and desperate cries for mercy for weeks afterwards. Yeah, we were royal dicks.

 nbsp;

Karma's a bitch, and I got what was coming to me one night. Kurt and Dimitri were busy studying for their midterms, so I went out on my own. By then, we'd gotten pretty much everyone in the surrounding area, so I decided to venture off across town and into unfamiliar territory. Finding a target wasn't difficult: you just had to look for cars with baby seats, houses with overly-colorful cartoon-themed curtains, or toys left in the yard. I came across a house that fit all three criteria, and parked my bike out of view. Playing with the tuner, I eventually found the right frequency. I could hear the sound of a baby snoring very lightly. A devious little smirk pushed its way onto my lips, and my heart began pounding with excitement. It was my time to shine.

 nbsp;

"Iamwatching", I whispered into the monitor, using the creepiest voice I could muster.

 nbsp;

The house remained dark and lifeless. I figured the home owners hadn't heard me.

 nbsp;

"Istandover your bedwatchingwaitingI will get you", I said, louder this time.

 nbsp;

Nothing. Just the sounds of crickets chirping, and the occasional dull roar of a car driving down the street. It was a little odd. Parents usually reacted much quicker than that. I began feeling a little nervous, and somewhat exposed. You know, like when you suddenly realize some creeper's gawking at you? It was getting late, and I had a long bike ride home. Just as I was about to give up and leave, I heard a strange, moist gurgling sound coming from the monitor. The quiet, rhythmic snores ceased, and I assumed the baby had woken up and was about to start crying. Instead, a man spoke to me.

 nbsp;

"You're the onebeingwatched nowJuan.", he said softly.

My stomach pirouetted at his words. How did he know my name?! I felt sick. Something was very wrong, and I could feel it in my bones. I glanced up at the nursery window, and saw a silhouette standing there watching me. Had he been there the whole time? The air was thick and difficult to inhale, though perhaps fear was making it hard to breathe. My body quivered uncontrollably, as a sense of dread poured into every inch of me. I climbed on my bike, pedalling desperately to get away. Part of me thought I was overreacting, but the overwhelming need to flee overpowered my rational mind.

 nbsp;

"Youcan't runI knowwhere you live, Juan", continued the man, even as I turned the corner.

 nbsp;

I flew down the street, not stopping until I reached a busy boulevard. Surrounded by cars and a few late night joggers, I felt safe.

 nbsp;

"Your hoodie will run red your blood, boy", whispered the man, still talking through the baby monitor in my pocket.

 nbsp;

A passerby gave me a nasty look as I yelped loudly in fear, practically ripping my hoodie in my frantic attempt at removing it. To the stranger, I must have looked like some snotty kid tripping balls or something. He didn't know I was in genuine distress, so I don't blame him for walking off with an insulted huff, though I wish he had offered to help me instead.

 nbsp;

After stuffing the hoodie into my backpack, I noticed my name scrawled on the back. It was my fucking school jacket: no wonder that bastard knew my name. It then occurred to me that baby monitors were fairly short-ranged, so I was obviously being followed. I nervously glanced around to try and identify my stalker. Was it the empty-looking van down the street? That guy walking his dog? The car that had just driven by? Either way, the last thing I wanted was to hear that voice again, so I turned off the device, and started pedalling towards my home. Fear had heightened my senses, and I began notice every motion of the trees in the breeze, every crackle of twigs under my wheels, and every car that zipped past me. I flinched whenever anyone came near, paranoid that whoever had spoken to me through the baby monitor was going to catch up. Fortunately, I made it home without incident.

 nbsp;

I parked the bike in my garage and crawled up the stairs to my bedroom. In one careless motion, I tossed my backpack and the baby monitor in the corner of my room, and dove under my sheets like an Olympic swimmer. It doesn't matter how old you are: nothing feels safer than being under your blanket. I closed my eyes, hoping I'd be able to calm down enough to catch a few hours of rest before class, but then I heard static coming from the monitor across the room. The monitor that was supposed to be off.

 nbsp;

"Sweet dreams, Juan.", said the voice that still haunts my nightmares.

 nbsp;

Needless to say, I didn't sleep a wink that night. I was too frightened to get out of bed until sunrise. When I got up, my first order of business was to remove the battery from the monitor and throw it in the trash. I didn't want anything to do with it any more. I came up with an excuse to give my buddies so they wouldn't think I was a huge pussy. With massive bags under my eyes, I got dressed, had breakfast, and went to school.

 nbsp;

It wasn't until a few days later that I saw the house on the news. In an interview, a police officer explained that the small family who had been living in the house had been found in their beds, necks slit open. I had been outside when it happened: the killer had heard me on the baby monitor and decided to fuck with me. It was definitely a wake-up call, and I thanked my lucky stars that I hadn't gotten the shit murdered out of me. I was too busy feeling thankful that I survived to feel bad about the family that hadn't. Empathy, like wisdom, comes with age.

 nbsp;

Now that I'm an adult with a wife and daughter, I truly understand the consequences of my actions, and the severity of the situation I put myself in as a tremendously stupid teenage boy. That dreadful night, I thought I reached the epitome of fear, but it was just the tip of the iceberg. As a father, I now know that fear thrives and multiplies when there's something more precious than your own life at stake. I can't say for sure whether the killer found me again after all these years, or whether a new breed of idiots had the same idea as my friends and I, but I can tell you that I now understand what true terror is. Last night, I heard something on our baby monitor that sent chills into my very soul, shackling me with a paralyzing fear that I doubt will ever leave me:

 Personally, I would never put my phone number online, for a variety of reasons. Can you imagine if you start getting charged for international text messages/calls?

That said, services like MagicJack and Skype let you buy phone numbers and receive calls through the magic of the internet rather than a phone line for a minimal fee. You could decide to set up a phone number for a couple of months and eventually drop it once the story loses its steam. That way, you don't get stuck with a huge phone bill and you maintain your privacy.

An alternative would be to use a fake email address. Easy to open, easy to close. 




 They want to steal my soul. 




 I'm sure it is. :P

Happy cake day. 




 Look at that adorable little guy! He thinks his arm is a gun!

Want to see the absolute BEST marine creature? Google red lipped batfish. Can you say sexy? 




 Aquaman would be so proud. 




 Why did I google mantis shrimp? WHY!? 




 one more reason to avoid the ocean. 




 Did you mean
[A story to scare my son](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2igaa9/a_story_to_scare_my_son/)?

It was amazing, but definitely not underrated, as it won the monthly contest. 




 Craig's a trustworthy fellow connected to a real website. He contacted me back in December for the same reason. Not sure why your emails aren't getting through: I had no trouble communicating with him back then. If/when you manage to get through, he'll send you a consent form to fill out.

I know they have a huge backlog of stories to adapt, so once that step is done, it might take a while before you see anything on their website. Either way, I assure you they're perfectly legitimate.

Just like /u/notsohornyowl said, they sometimes team up with The NoSleep podcast. 




 I'm chuckling, but only because you tell the story in such an entertaining way. Nothing wrong with self-preservation.

In my own experience, when I was a teen, I once legitimately thought someone had broken into my home. My reaction was to grab one of my decorative (but sharp) swords and search the house. AKA the dumbest freaking thing you can do in that kind of situation. Though I saw the man, heard his footsteps, heard him talking...the house was empty. It was one of many times some weird stuff happened in that house. I'd say calling the cops is the smartest move, Knotty. Better safe than super-murdered. 




 I was on TrueKnot-duty tonight. 




 Don't! It's perfect, like a beautiful drunken haiku. 




 HECK YEAH! 




 These things come in waves. In December-January, it was people doing rituals, now it's this. Before you know it, we'll be on to something else. (I'm hoping for a killer unicorn dog trend.) 




 No worries: a lot of people don't know about the NoSleep Finder. I'd help you out if I knew the story title, but I've never heard of it, sorry.


Welcome to the community, by the way! 




 In all seriousness, though. The [NoSleep Finder](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepfinder) is the perfect place to ask this question. Someone will find that story for you. 




 That wasn't a story. That was me PMing you asking for help. (Shhhh, they're watching me right now) 




 Aw, man. I miss out on all the good stuff by not having Netflix. Damn you, download cap, daaaamn youuuuuu! 




 Yara's Haunt gets my vote as a great addition - not a competitor, an addition - to the nosleep family.

Well said, my good fellow. Well said indeed!

Edit: He also did one of mine and it was awesome sauce, with a few sprinkles of cinnamon. 




 A dull current surged through the woman's watch and into my body. It wasn't strong enough to cause pain, unlike the shock I'd gotten when I touched that tree in the forest, so I kept hold while I waited for her to respond. My eyebrows furrowed together, helping me produce a menacing and hopefully intimidating glare. Theo was always better at shakedowns than I was. My grip tightened, as though I believed the pressure would be enough to force a response out of the woman.



"I'm just checking in to make sure you're enjoying your stay.", she replied in a friendly tone, though her eyes betrayed contempt.



My hand started to burn, as the strength of the current intensified violently and unexpectedly. It reminded me of the time I mistook Theo's hotplate for my alarm clock the ONE TIME he'd forgotten to turn it off. My hands snapped back to my sides, and I looked down at my palm. The flesh seemed fine: not a burn in sight. By the time I looked back up, the woman was gone, and I was outside again with Theo. The sound of music flooded my ears once more, and all the physical and emotional pain seemed to go away, until Theo kicked me in the shin.



"Dude, get it together!", he barked, snapping me back to reality.



"GOD DAMN IT, THEO!", I screamed, waving my arms around frantically. "This time, we fucking stick together, okay!?", I howled.


I didn't want to lose track of my friend again, so I looped an arm firmly around his. It didn't matter what it looked like: this was about survival, not keeping up appearances. No matter what happened, I wasnt going to let Theo out of my sight. Then, I noticed something on his wrist.


"...Theo...where did you get that watch...?", I asked. 




 I'm 27 and I have a 3DS, as does my 40-something co-worker. No shame in loving Nintendo.

Either you have a fun-loving entity in your house, or your mom secretly loves to play your game and was disappointed you took it with you. I would leave it home tomorrow and doodle a smiley face on the post-it. 




 New Brunswick. I'll look it up once I get home, thanks for the tip! 




 Though my heart belongs to the butler, what remains (of my love) is yours. 




 Same storm, different location. 




 Would you say they've GRINDed to a hault? 




 Yesterday, as I was vacationing in the maritimes, a massive blizzard hit the region. I saw something out in the storm, and it freaked me the fuck out. Even though it's now bright and sunny outside, I'm almost glad my flight home got cancelled, because at least now I can stay inside where it's safe. I'm afraid of what might be hiding out there in the snowdrifts.

 nbsp;

I woke up fairly late last morning. The basement apartment I rented for the week was practically pitch black, so I was startled to see it was already 10 am when I got around to checking the time. No light was coming through the blinds in the windows, making it seem as though it was still night. When I flipped open the blinds, I saw a wall of snow fully concealing me from the outside world. Grabbing my coat, I climbed the squeaky and narrow staircase leading to the side door. I could hear wind furiously hissing through a crease in the wall. I had heard about the region's infamous storms, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened when I opened that door. I was assaulted by a violent breath of snowy air. It nearly knocked me back, but I managed to grab hold of the hand ramp. Snow continued to invade the corridor and dart painfully into my eyes, making it almost impossible to see the tall snow bank that had once been a rental car. It took all my strength to get the door shut.

 nbsp;

As I returned to the quiet safety of the basement, I told myself there was no fucking way I was going outside again until the storm subsided. I grabbed my laptop, and checked out what people had to say on Twitter about the snowpocalpse. One helpful user posted a link to the city's traffic cameras, along with a single word: Creepy. Reassured that I wasn't the only out-of-towner disturbed by the sheer amount of snow, I followed the link to see how bad Main Street looked. The screen was practically all white, though I could make out a few buildings when the snow died down a bit. Though I'd been around snow all my life, I had never witnessed a blizzard first-hand, and I felt a little excited to be part of it. It was then that I noticed something odd in the street: there seemed to be a man standing in the flurry of snow. Thinking nothing of it, I switched to the other traffic cameras, checked out the rest of town, eventually grew bored, and shut the laptop so I could get breakfast.

 nbsp;

A few hours passed, but I could still hear mother nature having a temper tantrum outside. Bored, I looked at the traffic cameras again. I couldn't believe my eyes when I switched to Main Street. That fucking guy was STILL there! Sure, some people enjoy the cold, but this was ridiculous: he'd been standing there for hours. I switched to Main Street's secondary camera, which gave me a view from the other side of the street, hoping to see a squad car nearby. Maybe the guy was a traffic cop? Nothing. Not a damn thing. The snow-coated street was empty, except for a single human standing front-and-center. He gave me the creeps. Had he really been standing there the WHOLE time? I felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, as though I knew some weird shit was going down, even though there could have been a perfectly logical explanation I was overlooking. Suddenly, the power went out, and I screamed like a kid. Using the laptop's screen to light the way, I searched the apartment for a flashlight. Fortunately, the power came back on after about half an hour.

 nbsp;

By the time internet service was restored, another hour had gone by. I had only one thing in mind: finding out whether or not that scary motherfucker was still outside. I went straight for the traffic cam. Wouldn't you know it, he hadn't fucking moved. I could see him swaying back-and-forth calmly, as though completely unaffected by the chaos around him. Looking at him made me feel nervous, yet I could not avert my gaze. Due to the heavy snow, I could only make out his general male form and a brownish coat. The weirdest thing about him was that there didn't seem to be any accumulation of snow on or around him, which was quite a feat, considering everything else was coated in over 50 centimeters of snow.

 nbsp;

Just as I had had enough and was about to switch off, someone else appeared in view. It was a woman wearing a long blue coat. She was walking down the street, one arm shielding her face from the elements while the other stretched in front of her, as one would do in the dark to avoid running into things. The man took a single step towards her. At that moment, a gust of wind obscured the scene in a snowdrift. Once it cleared away, the figures were standing side by side, swaying in unison. I jumped to my feet and power-walked around the apartment, trying to jerk away the creepiness and goosebumps riding up my spine, while muttering "Oh hell no!" a dozen times beneath my breath.

 nbsp;

Over the course of the evening, I periodically checked out the live feed. The figures remained in the frame, but they started moving closer and closer towards the camera, until they were out of sight. I had to change angles to spot them off in the distance, towards a third figure, before losing sight of them completely.

 nbsp;

Maybe I'm freaking out over nothing...but, shit. I'm really spooked. I feel like they're still standing out there somewhere, you know? Has anyone else seen weird people in traffic cams? I can't possibly be the only person who saw these guys: they were there for almost 12 hours! Either way, I'm stuck here until tomorrow, so I'm just going to stay inside where it's safe. If you're in the maritimes, I suggest you do, too.
