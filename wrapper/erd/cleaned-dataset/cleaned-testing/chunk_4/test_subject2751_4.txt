 Yes indeed! I also like the fact that no two games will ever be the same. 




 I'm glad I'm part of a diversified group so everything gets played. But I do see what you mean, so it's a game that I will always be willing to play but not sure I want to own. 




 I completely agree with you. In the early turns there's not much going on, it's just about drafting the right combo of cards and tiles and taking a few 5/6s. Then it kicks off mid-game. 




 Fantastic week for me! Played for the first time:

**Kanban** - This is definitely one of my favourites in 2014. It's an interlocking puzzle and it's not as heavy or AP as I expected it to be. It's probably because (1) if you can't think of anything to do, most of the time you can just train; and (2) you can leech off other players' actions for scoring. We did however played the nice Sandra scenario so next time it might not be as easy as I think.

**St. Petersburg (2nd ed.)** - Very nice card drafting game. It feels like a more complex version of **Splendor** and less stressful version of **London**. I have not played the first edition before but the others said the new market tracks are an interesting addition.

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** - A great co-op deckbuilder. It almost feels like a very simplified version of Mage Knight with only the battle elements. The permanent upgrades also makes you want to replay it as well.

**Macao** - An early gem from Feld. There are many interesting choices every round which rewards careful planning and not being too aggressive. Some of the cards are written poorly though, so I do prefer his more recent games. A very solid and unique game still.

Games that I've played before: **Terra Mystica**, **Hyperborea**, **Machi Koro**, **Guildhall**, **Sail to India**, **Puerto Rico** 




 **Lords of Waterdeep** is a worker placement game that is easy to learn and the DnD theme (although not very apparent) may appeal to some in your group. The competition mainly comes from taking action spaces and quests that other players want, and playing cards that affect opponents.

**Lords of Xidit** is a programming game that is also easy to learn and it looks amazing. It is about recruiting characters to fight off monsters (NPC) on a map. You each have a dial and players simultaneously set their 6 actions of the round and then reveal together. Therefore you would need to guess/double-guess what other players are trying to do. 




 It depends slightly on location but for simplicity I'll use Amazon US prices. 

**Hanabi** - $9.89. Pure co-op logic/deduction card game with a slight twist - you can only see other players' hand but not yours. You give clues to each other  in order to play cards.

**Dominion** - $23.87. THE deck building game. Very simple rules, hours of fun. (Dammit why is this so cheap in the US. it's 30 here in the UK) 




 For me, it's about engine/efficiency building, upgrades, and the satisfaction when a plan actually worked. I don't mind randomness as long as the sequence is randomness -decision - outcome (**Castles of Burgundy**) and NOT decision - randomness - outcome (**Eldritch Horror**, **Eclipse**)

Examples: 

**Terra Mystica** - planning ahead for that chain reaction double town round for 10 extra points.

**Le Havre** - getting loans early in the game to fuel your shipping production then paying everything off in one go. 




 Based on the aspects you like, I recommend:
  **Terra Mystica** - It's a game about expanding your control on a map trying to form towns, while different buildings give you different income and abilities. No randomness after initial setup, not much direct conflict, managing the use of 3 resources (workers, money, power). There are no changing cost of resources though.

**Brass** - Economic game about connecting your industry empire to trade coal/steel/cotton. There's changing cost of resources. Not much direct conflict. Slight randomness due to card drawing. 

Alternatively, buy more expansions of **Power Grid** if you're just bored of the base map and power plants! 




 For every single game, there will always be people who hate it/regret buying/rate as a 1 on BGG etc. I think it's always important to decide for yourself (and your group) whether you like a game or not, especially when trying out a new type. 

It's also a very popular game so it's also likely that you could trade/sell it away if you didn't like it after all.  




 **Terra Mystica** with expansion: Played wit the mermaids. Doing quite well because of the # of clusters end game scoring, but I was greedy on the fifth round as I should have passed earlier when the good point scoring bonus tiles were up for grabs...came second and lost to dwarves :(

**Panamax**: One of my favourites of 2014. I was doing well early game and people started buying my shares and pushed the price up so I wasn't able to pay dividends in the final round. Pacing the cashflow is really important in this game! I'll try to get this played more often in 2015.

**Forbidden Desert**: Not a big co-op fan but I thought it was more interesting than Forbidden Island.

**Deus**: I was excited to try this but was disappointed as most parts of the game everyone was just staring down at their cards and there was no interaction at all. 

Gaming resolution this year: go to Essen. 




 I would say **Terra Mystica**

In TM There are a handful of actions you can choose each turn but it flows logically once you explain Terraform, Build, Power and Cult track. Everything else are just upgrades and ways of getting points.

In Eclipse, you will have to explain every single tech, battle, initiative, dice roll modifiers are not as easy to remember.

On the flipside, for the first Eclipse game you could all play with human races to simplify things a bit but you have to pick factions in TM. 




 positive: **Terra Mystica**, **Brass**, **Glory to Rome**
negative: **Battlestar Galactica** 




 It's H@ll Games/Pegasus Spiele, perhaps its the European edition?

It's a medium heavy game, the weight is about same as Trajan. I played once with 2p and once with 4p. Every action is an interlocking puzzle, which unfortunately means that people with AP will slow this game down a lot. 




 Yes if you are a big fan of Dixit/co-op/social interaction/family friendly games!  




 Thanks for your suggestion! Seriously, I think that would improve the strategy element. 




 A quiet week because of Christmas:

**Mysterium**: Played with a full 7 player game - lost inevitably. We agreed that 4-5 would probably be the best player count. Nonetheless, there was a lot of discussion and we all had a good time.

**Aquasphere**: Another nice puzzle-like game from Feld. Love the wooden pieces of the game.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig**: 2p game didn't turn out great because a lot of rooms are not in play so it's difficult to plan ahead. I'll probably only play with 4p with this one.

**Russian Railroads**: About my 10th play, starting to get repetitive.

**Star Realms**: One of the best 20 minutes game out there. Easy to teach, quick and fun (when things go right for you that is). 

**Trajan**:  The mancala bit is still fresh to us and fun to plan ahead with.

**Bucket King 3D**: Silly little party game. Remember to draw cards after playing them. Always.

**Oregon**: A decent abstract tactical game. I wish there are more of these relatively short (45 minutes) game that comes in small boxes.

**Grog Island**: The bidding and catch-up mechanic is quite interesting (when you pass an auction, you still get some kind of reward). Surprised the rating isn't higher with this one.

It takes time for people to cast votes - so I'll expect 4-5 of them to make it into top 100 in a year's time. (**Dead of Winter**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Five Tribes**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**...) How long they'll stay in the top 100 is another matter.

I think there are many solid games released this year, especially in the light/medium weight spectrum which greatly helps in promoting the hobby (**Splendor**, **Istanbul**, **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **King of New York**)
