 I almost drowned when I was 3/4 years old. Until then I loved swimming but it took 3 years for me to even get out of a kiddies pool after it and any attempt to take me for swimming lessons would result in me screaming the place down.

I've never properly learned how to swim, I can do basic strokes but not for long periods of time and can't tread water. I'm still wary in deep water, it freaks me out if I can't see the bottom. 




 The sound and feel of polystyrene rubbing together. It's the worst part of opening packaging. 




 Writing anything in pen. I'm not sure about anyone else but if I have to write for extended periods of time I end up with a massive stain on the side of my hand. 




 I curl up under my covers, plug my earphones into my phone, stick on Spotify and shut out the world. 




 Although I'm with you on supporting the mages (Meredith be crazy!) Orsino is not the nice kindly elf he appears to be. During All That Remains it becomes apparent that he has been at least assisting Quentin with his "research".  




 I second your opinion on Vivienne. On my first playthrough all I could think was "what a condescending, snobby cow." As such I missed a lot of her dialogue because I never took her with me.

After playing again and actually listening to her I realise just how hard she had to work to attain her position, and although her and my Quiz will never agree politically, I can still respect her opinion.
