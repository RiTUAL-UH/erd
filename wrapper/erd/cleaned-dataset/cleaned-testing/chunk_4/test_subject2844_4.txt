 Sounds painful 




 I have a hunch that he didn't throw for another touchdown that game haha. 




 Holy shit dude! 




 Tearing your achilles sounds like a terrible injury. 




 Glad your friend was ok. A friend of mine got hit in the throat in a lacrosse game a few years back. He took a pretty hard shot (80-90 mph) right in the trachea and had to go to the hospital, but he also ended up being okay. Just some trouble breathing for a few days.  




 That is an absolute nightmare 




 That is tragic 




 Please share your stories of terrible injuries you have seen during a sporting event, either while on the field or in the stands. I know you Redditors have seen some crazy things before, shock me! 




 Do you paint your eyebrows on? 




 I have that same vape. It is incredible! 




 A killer blowjob 




 Ketchup 




 That is so badass. It will save a lot of lives. Muricaaaaa!!! 




 My cheeks sweat when I eat green apples. It's a strange reaction. 




 In Harbaalke We Trust! That was an excellent article and it was nice to get some insight on Trent Baalke. Thanks OP. 




 I have a Bernese Mountain dog and when I take it to the park people will always comment, "That's a nice looking Burmese." For some reason, it always get under my skin. 




 Can confirm, am the Devil. 




 I never let it touch the ground. I was very careful about that. That is no joking matter, I take that very seriously. 









 You sir, are a badass! Have an upvote. 









 That old guy hammering his french fries was awesome. He was so focused on his fries, he didn't even notice the camera right in his face. 




 Finnerty's is the place to go in NYC!

 I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote.

 USA USA USA!!! 




 Looks like the skeleton from Tales from the Crypt! 




 Such wow! 




 Looks more like a leopard. 




 But first, lemme take a selfie! 




 I couldn't care less about whether I get upvotes or downvotes. I dislike when people try to put words in my mouth. You are drawing some wild conclusions. You continue to try to infer things from my posts that couldn't be further from the truth. You are free to try to interpret my anti-terrorism rhetoric however you deem necessary. After all, it is a free country! 




 You are a complete idiot Cyan. I am of the belief that if you are responsible for a terrorist attack on the United States of America, you should be taken down with swift vengeance. I made no references to the power granted to the NSA or condoned the intrusion of people's basic civil liberties. I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be downvoted for condemning terrorism. Pretty disgusted with this thread right now! 




 I hope we take down any other fuckers involved with the Boston Marathon bombing. You fuck with the bull, you get the horns!

 Stupid people having children!

 Were you just poofing dust out of your dick by the end of your marathon? 




 It's a hard knock life being Jay-Z!
