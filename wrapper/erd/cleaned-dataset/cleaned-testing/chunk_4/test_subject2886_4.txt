 I know I'm a bit late, but I just need to rave about a store I found I couple weeks ago when I was traveling for my sister's hooding (also congrats to her for being almost done with her Ph.D!!) Sorry in advance for the book.

There's this show store in Berkeley, California called The Walk Shop. Their motto is "shoes for people who walk." The entire point is shoes that are comfortable. 

I did ballet for 9 years. I'm 21 years old, and have legitimate arthritis in my knees and I don't remember the last time one or both of my ankles hasn't hurt, sometimes to the point that I ha e to take a sick day for it because I literally can't walk.

I got these ( http://www.imgur.com/fVilOdH.jpeg) for her commencement, and I have literally never had more comfortable shoes. And they're cute as heck, at least to me. They're Cobb Hill brand, and have changed my life. I didn't realize that shoes could be cute AND make me not want to cut off my legs after a full day on my feet.

/rave, anyone in that area should def look this place up. A lot of their stuff is not the most stylish, but I saw a huge amount of cute things that felt just amazing. 




 I was lucky in that I made my dresses both years. Senior year, I made a gorgeous backless mermaid dress. But you're right; unless you know exactly what works, you'll probably look strange.

EDIT: I was also maaaaybe 110 pounds at that point. So, yeah. 160 pound me now would look terrible in it, and probably anything like it, even if I made it myself to my exact measurements. 




 Grrl. I know it's frowned upon, but I wear leggings as pants all the time. I just make sure to wear at least two pairs at a time, to make sure they aren't see through. I wear regular tops with them, and think "red hair don't care" about everyone who tries to tell me it looks bad. 




 I just finished COLL-C105, Quantum Mysteries for Everyone as my breadth of inquiry class. If you've taken any physics class ever, it's too easy to explain. But I spent half of high school assuming I'd be a physics major, before switching to political science after 3 weeks, haha.

I've also heard people say POLS-Y105, intro to political theory, is a gen ed (idk, I'm a poli sci major), and I also just finished it and it was awesome. A lot of reading, but amazing. However, I'd say to wait until Prof. Craiutu is back from his sabbatical. I took his classes 3 semesters in a row, and I feel bad for anyone taking any political theory class that isn't taught by him.

My knowledge is mainly in the poli sci department, but I will say DO NOT take POLS-Y103, intro to comparative politics, or really any comparative politics classes, unless you absolutely have to. 

Sorry if you're in the majority that doesn't like politics at all, that's just the experience I have.

Tl;dr: if you can wait a year or so to get your gen ed out of the way, take POLS-Y105, when Prof. Craiutu is teaching it, but be prepared to read a lot. 




 Peplums look bad on everyone. No matter what. 




 Yeah. Like, I've had some guys who tell me I can give out their digits no matter what, but I still ask them beforehand, and will only do it for close friends. Common courtesy to me, they are providing an illegal service. 




 There's also the issue of your dealer's dealer. My old weed dealer's dealer was also involved in coke, and my guy got fucked because an undercover officer was assigned to scope out the coke.

Even if you only do an ounce at a time, you have to realize that you're probably going somewhere with pounds fairly often. A friend was dating my guy's guy for a while, and I remember being so nervous when he went to roll a blunt and asked me which of his two strains I wanted to smoke, pulling out 2 pounds. 




 Everyone has that one bad tequila story, man. For me, it only happens when I mix it. When I want to drink tequila, I can't drink anyrhing else. Dark and lights, hard and soft, every other combination is okay with me, but tequila + any other alcohol = immediate bad time. 




 Hate this phrase, but I can't even. Too much stupid for my brain to handle. 




 I've just lived here too long. I think everyone has some beef with their home town. 




 Sometimes? I'm from Btown (one of the few almost civilized parts) and I'm literally always ashamed. 




 Valpo is a special place. Like the rest of Indiana. 




 I think you might have just posted the best thing I will ever read. 




 My baby Kate was the runt, too, and she's so rambunctious.  




 Our cat at home gets an old hamper with pillows and an electric blanket amd a heating pad for if it gets really cold on the porch. He likes it. 




 Not sure if it's the Asian ones that squirt some foul smelling something or other, but I'm super allergic to that shit and makes me hate the little nuggets. 




 Like the title says, I'm flying from Indiana to California tomorrow morning for my sister's hooding. I searched, but I couldn't find anything about this specifically. 

I have a metal lunchbox in which I keep my makeup. I know to bag the foundation, concealer, and mascara, but is that all? I'll put my shampoo and conditioner in empty pill bottles, but can I still put the metal box in my carry-on? I won't be able to check anything, because my family is already paying a lot for the stay, so any help will be great. 

Does lipstick count as a gel? What about a marker type eyeliner? I really don't know anything about this. 




 Thanks for making me remember all my favorite songs from Freshman year of high school are actually about heroin.  




 Exactly! I've never been to Japan or anything like it, but the two are very different. A bath is to relax, a shower is to get clean. 




 Hello all!

In this week of super stress, I like to make two of my most comforting foods: fried dough and curry.

http://www.imgur.com/ithjHq5.jpeg
Here are the hush puppies. 

1 box Jiffy mix
2 eggs
~1/2-3/4 cup each corn and diced onion (I used frozen because it's what I had)
Vegetable oil to fry
Salt, red pepper flake, and garlic powder to taste

Mix together all the ingredients in a bowl.
Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet. I don't have a thermometer, but most recipes say 350 is what you want.
Drop small spoonfuls of the corn mix into the oil, fry until golden brown, flip, and transfer to a plate with paper towels. I found that these cooked up really fast, maybe a minute on one side and 30 seconds on the other.
Add salt, pepper, whatever (I really wanted Old Bay, but didn't have any) while they're still hot.

I think if I could have actually deep fried these, they would have been more like hush puppies. Really they were more like fried cornbread blobs, but they were still delicious. 

http://www.imgur.com/P4Tah1S.jpeg
And this is roasted cauliflower and carrot curry. This I didn't measure at all, so I'll guesstimate. It ended up with about three servings.

The veggies:
1 cup each frozen cauliflower florets and sliced carrots (again, frozen is all I have right now)
2 tbl curry powder
Salt to taste
~1 tbl vegetable oil, to drizzle on top

Spread the veggies evenly on a baking dish
Sprinkle curry powder and salt on top, mix to coat
Drizzle oil on top
Roast in a 425 oven for 25 minutes

The rice/sauce:
1 cup rice (before cooking) + water to cover one inch above
1/4 stick butter
Flour (sorry, I have no idea how much)
~1/4 cup curry powder
Water
Salt and red pepper flake to taste

Cook the rice as directed (I did it in the microwave because I'm lazy and made this at 5am)
In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and make a roux (continue stirring until it creates a paste).
Add more curry powder and water to make it more saucy.
Add the vegetables and cooked rice into the sauce, mix well, add salt/pepper/whatever to taste.

I wish I had had coconut milk or chicken stock for this, but I was just using what I had.

For some reason, these are two of my favorite comfort foods. I'm broke as a joke, so I didn't have the options I usually would. However, they still turned out pretty well. Adapt, adopt, and improve. 




 Beautiful, and I LOVE the name. 




 I have a friend who takes forever to order and likes to make her own thing. We went to one of the student bars on a busy night one time and she spent 15 minutes going back and forth with things like "I want something chocolatey," "oooh, raspberry or strawberry vodka," "what would go well with that," etc. The bartender had to leave to treat the regulars, and she ended up with something like "two shots of Bailey's, half a shot of raspberry vodka, some chocolate liqueur, and the rest with tonic water." I felt so bad, I just got a rum and coke.

I'm guessing most bartenders would be happy to serve you anything normal, so long as you know what you want before you bother them. 




 I failed two classes this semester. I've been too sad to go to class, so the ones that take attendance failed me. They were both major classes.

I drink too much. I know I do, and I know it's a problem. But drunk is pretty much the only time I don't feel miserable.

I graduated high school 6th in my class. My gpa was 3.86. I was depressed, but it came so easily to me. Now, after my third year of college, I'll be lucky to have a 2.3. 

I just haven't cared all semester, and now I feel like a complete failure. I'm afraid to see my family. My sister is about to get her Ph.D. from one of the best schools in the country. My dad has one in physics, and recently got sober.

I can't even work up the energy to cry. I'm broke, so I can't even buy booze to make myself feel better. Even my cats don't make me feel any better about myself.

I've gained a bunch of weight, I haven't showered in a week, and I never see any friends. I still have two more finals and I don't care, but I know I need to step it up if I want to not fail all of my classes.

It's getting time where I have to start worrying about getting jobs. I'm gonna have to take a victory lap, which my parents are fine with, but I may even need two. I'm going part time next semester, for sure, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I've always dreamed of working in the government, but I'm so far from the cream of the crop that I'm that rejected corn that gives livestock mad cow. I had to drop my French major, which means my fallback of becoming a French teacher isn't even a possibility anymore.

I've wanted to do the Peace Corps for forever, but I doubt I can bring my cats with me to Africa, and I doubt even more that I can go two years without them. On top of that, they wouldn't accept me with my grades.

Tl;dr: I failed my first two classes ever this semester, I feel like a failure, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. All I wanna do is cry, and I can't even do that. 




 I'm not sure what the trail is, but there's a nice wooden deck thing looking over a lake at Leonard Springs that's only a 10-15 minute walk from the parking lot 




 I see you aren't hunting. You must be very hungry. Here, I give you foodz 




 I'll just say right quick that time out was effective for me as a kid because it was specifically the same place where I got spanked if I was really bad. My mom would make my sister and I sit at the base if the stairs, by the kitchen where she could watch us. 




 On btownmenus. I know I needed it after this "dead"week.

 Not op, but I'm guessing it's just a normal crust, custard, and fruit on top. 




 They're not, I got the ginger so the other would have a friend. They play fight fairly often, but are also snuggly and give each other baths. 




 The grey/white since August, the ginger since February. They're both a little over a year old. 









 Fun fact, I originally heard of this line back when she was the singer of Sky Salt (still one of my favorite bands). It's sad that they broke up and she turned dramariffic. 




 I pride myself on my croissants, and a curry butternut squash risotto is my ultimate comfort food.  




 I've only made pasta a handful of times, but I always found that just making a pile of noodles when they're wet and letting them dry that way always worked. It kinda looks like ramen. 




 Late, but Breckenridge Agave Wheat. Simply amazing. 




 Honestly, DSOTM is my least favorite. Momentary Lapse of Reason and Piper at the Gates of Dawn are the best, in my opinion. And PF songs were my lullabies every night growing up.

And of course Wish You Were Here. 




 My father and I both make a point to only listen to this album twice a year, because it makes us both cry/rage/yell at everyone. Momentary Lapse of Reason forever. 




 Good for him! I'm glad he's been able to transition to what he feels is right. Hope all is going well for him. 




 So instead, I got two cats. And they're the loves of my life, but I will always be a dog person. I especially want a really big dog, the kind who would either need room to run around, or multiple 3-mile walks every day, and I'm lucky if I walk a mil every day, haha. 




 I recently quit smoking weed. I don't remember the last time I was this anxious. 

I wake up multiple times a night after having falling nightmares. I've been dreaming otherwise about a man who emotionally abused me. 

I get drunk all day, every day. I don't remember the last day I didn't get drunk. I get the shakes every morning, and I don't feel normal unless I'm drunk.

About a month ago, my dad finally went into alcohol rehab. He's now in an Intensive Outpatient Program for it. 

When I was six, I remember him teaching me that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer." And I'm turning into him.

The last time I went without booze for 3 days, I had to talk myself down from cutting or trying to kill myself multiple times a day. I hate that a handle lasts me two days; I hate that I need to bring a flask with me to class; I hate that I need to get drunk to spend time with my family; I hate that more than half of my money goes to booze. But most of all, I'm terrified of what could happen if I were to quit. 




 I couldn't put text in on my phone.

I've literally never done anything to my brows. Never plucked, never gotten them shaped, never filled them in--nothing. I know they could be better, although I've gotten compliments on them before

What should I do? I just bought my first pair of tweezers, but I'm scared of over-plucking.

Also excuse the early morning, no makeup face.

EDIT: here's a side view http://www.imgur.com/VaBMLfm.jpeg

EDIT 2: I don't want to go get it done professionally, I don't have anywhere near me besides a threading place that is notorious for making brows way too thin. And I really enjoy doing things myself.  









 Bassetts are my favorite ever. Wish I could support a dog right now, but can't.

OMG THOSE EARS DO 




 I just hope my other kitty won't get her cold, but I doubt it, cuz that's how germs work.  




 She got some meds yesterday, and she's been napping and sneezing today, but I'm soooooo happy she's feeling better. My cats are my children.  




 When she puked 5 times in one day when she only did once after eating food too fast, I was concerned. She seems to be doing better today, although she's been napping and sneezing a lot. 




 Obviously, after all that yakking and sneezing, I took her to the vet yesterday. Now we're 18 hours puke free and she got some antibiotics and antinausea medicine. She's been sleepy and has the sneezy wheezies, but I think she's well on her way. This was my first kitty illness, so I was freaking out all day yesterday, but she seems to be feeling much better already. 









 My kitties do this, but with immediate lap time, since they're too small for hugs. 




 I wanted to make a throwaway for this, but fuck it. I had a craigslist hookup once, and as soon as I saw his Nazi paraphernalia and a big Nazi chestpiece tattoo, I left. Like, this dude had a Nazi armband framed next to his copy of Mein Kampff. 

Skinheads are sometimes punks, but not all punks are skinheads.  




 I didn't even notice this. /r/gonewildstories exists for a reason, it's where I get most of my (lady) fapping material. 




 I want to become a high school French teacher, and this makes me sad. I mean, in my high school experience, most of the parents seemed awful (southern Indiana here), but I only hung out with kids whose mothers read to them all the time growing up.

I was also homeschooled 2nd-6th grade, because I was at a 5th grade reading level in 1st grade, so maybe my views are skewed. My dream job is secretary of education, to fix our fucked up system (our meaning the USA's). 




 This. I've stopped looking both ways before I cross the street because I honestly don't care if I were to get hit by a car, but I'm taking steps. 

I relapsed last week after 18 months, and the last time was when I attempted suicide. 

The first step is to try hard to be not miserable. While that is a far cry from happy, it can be liberating. Try to see the silver linings. I know myself well enough to know that I will never be a "glass half full" type of person, so I try to look for the silver linings. I slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, but I got a legit knee brace put of it, which I've needed for years. 

We all know it's hard. It's harder than a lot of things. It's a legitimate addiction, but there's no self-harm anonymous. The most we can do is try. 

Try every day. Use a rubber band, call a friend, go play with kitties at the shelter, anything. And, most of all, know that there are people who care. You're free to PM me anytime. If need be, I'll give you my number so you have someone to call. 

I don't know you, but I care about you. You deserve to live. You deserve to feel better. You deserve to be (at least) not miserable.  




 That star trek blanket may be my favorite thing ever. 









 I've said this before, but I wish I could volunteer at the shelter. If I did, I'd end up adopting everyone, because I fall in love so quickly, haha.

My first kitty was originally a foster, and she stole my heart after I lived with her/fed her/took care of her for two months. She's a sweet, rambunctious, tiny salt and pepper tabby with a white underside. 




 This makes me feel bad now. When I went to adopt Guillaume, my second kitty, I went to his room first and he immediately climbed into my lap. He's a big orange moogie, which is my personal favorite type of kitty.

I did go to all the other rooms and fell in love with a couple others, but I wanted someone outgoing and around the same age as my first baby, Kate. 




 Yay for dog cats. My first one also loves to play fetch. 




 I'm gonna have to try these. I'm used to spending a lot of time on my baked goods (making croissants from scratch is my happy place). 




 But can I get TP with the same print? 




 And The West Wing's Donna 




 Haha, I apparently give great back massages with my feet (yay 9 years of ballet), but it still just seems weird to me that walking on someone to get them off. Massages, sure (with proper knowledge and support, cuz doing it wrong can seriously fuck up your back), but the whole getting off on it seems weird.

Also, like I said before, I'm only 21, so a 33 year old seems too old for me. He wanted a relationship, and I'm wanting to date people who are still in college or just out of college. 




 I would, but the only real room with a door in my apartment (in the bathroom) doesn't have a real closing mechanism. It has handles, but they're just handles on either side of a hole in the door. My closet has a real closing mechanism, but I'd feel awful locking anyone in the 3x5 foot space without a litter box. 




 Thanks! And sorry for the late reply. I used to feed Kate on top of the fridge, which helped, but they both like to hang out there, and I've had to pick up food and water off my kitchen floor several times, since they both have those bowls that hold food and water. 

I've been trying feeding them separately, but they're still stealing. It's been better, though, because they steal mutually now. They eat half a bowl of food, then they switch and eat the other's half. 




 Grapefruit juice and Gewuztraminer.  Really not a mimosa, but too good not to try. 




 I've got a friend who makes GnT's with cilantro all the time in the summer. Perfect! 









 Same here. A bank teller once told me that she was the mother of someone who went to my high school. A month later, I went back in with my mom, and she said the teller looked familiar. I immediately said "that's (this person)'s mom!" It took her by surprise, to say the least. 




 This is why I can't wait to live on a coast. I remember a summer I spent in Northern France, on the coast, and I went out in the morning, caught some crab, cooked them, and ate them all in around 4 hours. Anywhere in Indiana that claims to have "fresh" seafood is lying. 




 My mom wanted me to make brownies for my sister before she got her med card, haha. 




 Thank you, like everyone else has said.   My vet at home was a lot like you: caring, thoughtful, and wonderful. He understood when my whole family was there, bawling their eyes out, when we had to finally put the family dog down. He had arthritis, and we think diabetes, along with doggy Alzheimer's. He would forget to eat for days, then had seizures because his blood sugar was too low. 

You are a great person for feeling how hard it is to put down a pet. It's usually for their own good, because they simply can't understand the horrible things happening to them. My Buddha was 15 when we put him down, and I was only 16. He was my baby brother, and I still visit where we buried him fairly often. 

Again, thank you. I hope all vets are like you, and mine at home. 




 But thanks for the advice 




 The only real door I have is in my bathroom, where I feed the newbie. It doesn't have a real handle, and they can both get through any doorstop I put there.

By no real handle, I mean that you can pull it closed, but the handle is just a hole on both sides with the handle, but there is no actual closing mechanism.  




 I've searched and didn't find a good answer.

I brought a new cat into my home, and the two are getting along swimmingly. But, the newbie (Bill, around a year old, same as Kate, the original one) keeps stealing Kate's food. I still have the bowls in separate rooms, but once Bill finishes his food, he goes into the other room and eats most of Kate's. 

Is there any way I can keep him from doing this? I've taken him away when I catch him doing it, but he's much bigger than Kate, and I think he bullies her away from it.

Tl;dr: new cat eats old cat's food, and I want to make sure they're both eating enough. Worried about old cat's eating habits, since the newbie eats most of hers. 

EDIT: As background, Kate is an exceptionally small cat. She was even smaller than the normal runt of her litter. Bill is already fairly round, I call him "fatty Mcfatface" as a joke. Kate is fairly skinny, and I'm not sure if it's just because she has a small build,  or if it's because Bill steals her food. 




 No, but I'm only 21. That big of an age gap bugs me. I've got an older sister (26 next month), and it just seems weird to be with someone older than her. 19-24 is my comfort zone.  




 You may be the best SO ever. This looks so amazing. 




 Not an SO, but someone on okcupid sent me a message asking if I'd like to walk on him. I'd do it, but he was also 12 years my senior, and didn't seem compatible anyway. 









 Sadly, it's no longer on Netflix. I may try to track it down, but it is actually one of my favorite films. Set in something similar to WWII 




 I know the argument has been made many times that we shouldn't judge a girl on her size. Saying "a real man loves a girl with curves" is just as bad as saying "anything more than a handful is a waste."

I've gained 20 pounds in the last few months. I mean, I was considered "too thin" before that, but I have always been self conscious about how small my tits are. But even after gaining all that weight, due to stress, depression, and how much easier it is to order food than to cook for yourself, my tits are still less than one of my handfuls. And, for my whole life, I have been called "baby hands." I hate it. 

I feel fat, because I have a noticeable stomach pudge. I can't fit into a lot of the clothes I bought last fall, when I was put on medicine that I was told would make me gain weight. To put it into perspective, when I was put on that medicine, I was 5'8" and 112 pounds. When I felt healthy finally, I was at 125. I'm not was 145, and I was told at the doctor's that my blood pressure was higher than it should be.

I've been watching what I eat, I quit smoking so I could finally even make it to the gym without feeling like I had finally had a full workout.

But I hate so much the idea that "anything more than a handful is a waste." Even though I'm not fit, I feel fat as hell, my tits are still not a real person's handful.

Can we stop with this dichotomy of "real men prefer girls with curves" and "more than a handful is a waste?" It hurts, even for those of us who are on the smaller end of the spectrum. 




 This makes me sooo happy that I'll have my two cats (both 11-months old) for the next 10-20 years. I hope I'll have kids by then. 




 I want to go to mass. I want to go to confession. The ritual and the idea on confessing all the bad you've done seems really appealing to me. I'd never take communion, because I think it would be offensive to take the body and blood of something I don't believe in, but the structure, the moral directives, the forgiveness appeals to me so much.

I think of religion as something to make you be a good person. And if you need an invisible man in the sky to make you a good person, I am completely fine with it. I don't; I want to be a good person because the world has seen too much injustice, too much hate.

But the structure that church can give you seems great to me. 




 Thank you for this. It's been almost 2 years since I broke up with my first boyfriend, and I'm only now realizing the good things we had. He did a lot of these things for me, too. 




 Oatmeal is the only thing that does it for me. A small bowl, soaks up errythang 




 That's awful! I've used henna for the last 7-8 years and wanna change it up, but this terrifies me. 




 Sorry for the delay.

I got a mistic e-cig, and I can get 0% nicotine cartridges, so I may switch to them in a while.

Good to know it's working for your mom! 




 Mainly I'm noticing the cough I've had since August is starting to dissipate, haha. 




 I usually don't post in here, but I'm excited. I'M QUITTING SMOKING! After 2+ years. I'm only on day two, and I'm cheating a little by going the e-cig route, but I'm not a super bitch, and I'm already noticing a difference in my lung capacity.

EDIT: I know this doesn't have a question, so I guess if anyone has tips past the e-cig, I'd love it. I'm doing a bunch of crochet, and I hope to start exercising once I can walk to the gym without panting and wanting to die. 




 If you can deal with the incredible sweetness, I've done caramel appletinis with sour apple schnapps and caramel vodka. Suuuuuper sweet, bordering on too sweet, but still pretty good. 




 I'll keep that in mind next time. I like cold meatloaf sandwiches, so the loaf pan is great for that, but it does seem a little too fatty on top. 




 Is there really any way to make meatloaf look nice? It tastes amazing, and that's all that really matters. 




 So, I was dumb and didn't think about a recipe. Here's basically what I did.

2 pounds ground pork
1/2 cup garlic breadcrumbs
5-6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1/2-3/4 cup frozen pepper-onion blend from Kroger.
2 eggs
Hoisin and sriracha to cover.

Mix pork, breadcrumbs, and eggs together. Sweat onions and peppers, add mushrooms and saute until lightly wilted. Mix vegetables into the pork mixture. Put in loaf pan, and cover with hoisin sauce and sriracha. Bake for an hour, turn off oven and let sit inside for another ten minutes. Let sit for at least another ten minutes. 




 I've recently been into updating comfort food. It was very good. 




 Sorry! I basically followed http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/14629/mushroom-meatloaf this, but with pork and hoisin instead of ketchup. 




 I didn't use a recipe, just based the ratios from a google search.

I've had the idea of a vaguely asian meatloaf for a while, and I always crave meatloaf when it's been cold for so long. 









 :-( I just dont understand the type of person who could do that. 




 I adopted a new cat on Friday. My first cat was a foster I fell in love with, but the second's story is so sad.

The shelter told me that he was brought in after someone's cat had kittens and couldn't handle them all. He was adopted once, and a week later, he was brought back in as a stray. His first adoptive owner never came for him when they called. 

He is seriously the sweetest cat I've ever met. He crawled into my lap immediately at the shelter, and spends most of his time there now.

I just don't understand at all how someone could give him up. He's so wonderful.

Does anyone else's cat have a sad past? 




 I hardly ever see people actually using that crosswalk. I do, but a lot of the time, people just cross wherever they want, including ten feet from the crosswalk. I'm of the opinion that, if you decide to drive on tenth, you need to factor in the traffic. Just leave earlier. 




 And they already shut down parts of 10th every summer. 




 The first thing I remember my dad teaching me was that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer."

Let's just say alcoholism runs in the family. 




 Same. I doubt I could teach my cats this trick. 




 He's an 11-month old male, and seems to be very friendly and confident. I went to the shelter for their free feline friday, and he immediately came and sat on my lap. I just got him home, so he's been sniffing around the apartment.

I had a short introduction with my 10-month old, Catrine, and there was ne'er a hiss. I'm still gonna keep them generally seperate for a few days, but I'm gonna let him explore while I sequester Kate, switching them every few hours.

Guillaume is the French version of William, so I think I'll call him Bill for short. I think all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys. 









 Maybe I'm weird. Or it may be because I'm completely in love with my specific apartment, but I love them. 




 I don't know anything about those specific places, but I'm renting with PavProps and they're the best. The maintenance men come within 12 hours of putting in a request, they shovel/scrape the sidewalk for you, and, if you stay on their good side, they can be very nice. I'm planning on getting a second cat, and when I called, they said that they wouldn't charge me more pet rent.

My friends renting with Grant Properties say that that landlady is wonderful, too.

EDIT: Several of my friends live in the Lincoln Hill apartments (544 S. Lincoln) and they're really nice. I looked at a one-bedroom there, and it's very nice. And they allow up to 2 cats. But it may be a bit far from Kelley.
