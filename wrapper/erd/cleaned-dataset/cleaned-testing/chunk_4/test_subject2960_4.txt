 I can understand why someone would be hesitant. I was always very against taking medication personally but I hit a very rough patch this summer and saw how horrible I'd been acting. At that point I was willing to admit that some medication would help me. 




 all of my mental illness has come from times where I was alone. I've had deep existential self loathing from times where I been more or less isolated. I don't think I like myself very much and it can be very frightening.  




 It's awful, it gives you hope, but you know what's happening and you don't want to be alone.  




 I was to put it lightly a jerk to everyone I know. I was condescending, cynical and sometimes belittling. I've worked on it a lot I lost a lot of good people in the mean time. I've found the medication that I've been taking takes the edge off of my "chip on the shoulder" attitude. 




 I think we both "liked" each other for a long time before we actually started dating. We were best friends because we were both sort of a little outcast from everyone else in highschool. We were both art types so we got along really well.  I asked her out at the end of grade 11 and she said no, so I went on and met some other girls had a really fun summer, I come back the following fall and she hijacks me in her car and basically tells me that we're dating "before any other girl snatches me up." We lost our virginities to each other and I seriously doubt I could find another girl like her.

We dated for two and half years, she was someone who I felt like I could be in my own skin around. We went to school in the same city and spent almost all of our time together. Then my depression and anxiety started, I ended up taking it out on her (jealousy, anger, general insecurity) which wasn't fair and she deserved so much better. It's difficult to show love and trust to someone when you don't love and trust yourself.

She fell in love with someone else and now they're dating. I'm still pretty wrecked up about it, and the worst part is knowing that it's all my fault. I moved home because I need to get my head sorted so we don't live in the same city anymore. We still talk every few weeks over skype, but I feel incredibly insincere and guilty. I miss her every day. 
 




 I spent about a year on a high horse because I started using biting ice cold rational to criticize basically the way most people go on with their lives. We entertain and distract ourselves to death and I refused to participate for almost a year. I tried to better myself because the only other course of action was passivity. My rationale was supported by a lot of academic research and personal experience. Having this depressing hypercritical worldview did make me quite the elitist because no one else would bother to do the research and work that I'd done to achieve what appears to be so evident.

I'm not sure what to make of my ideas anymore, they seem true and seem like the right course of action, but they isolated me from all my friends and loved ones. I've now decided to tone myself down so that maybe I can be happy again someday. 




 Pushed everyone away and definitely not for their own benefit. I thought that everyone didn't want or need me. My ex left me ( she'd been my best friend for several years) and I've now moved across the country to mostly isolate myself. I'm starting to make friends here now but I've had months alone. 




 I'd definitely participate. This sounds like a great idea. 




 Me and my ex broke up in May of this year. We'd been dating for 2.5 years and had been friends for 5. We were each others first relationship. It was a bad split, I was dealing with depression, we weren't communicating well, I took my depression out on her and said/did somethings that were highly inappropriate, I'm pretty sure we were both feeling trapped. 

She broke up with me and I really tried to keep a persona of being cool and alright with the breakup, that I was doing alright and moving on. The truth was that I hadn't been sleeping or eating and that I started seeing a therapist to get my depression under control. My ex started dating someone else a few weeks of us splitting up (I'd had my suspicions about this guy before we split up) 

Over the summer I did the shitty ex thing and sent her an angry letter telling her she was selfish and that she never cared about me in the first place. This came from a very unhealthy place and I regret sending it a lot. I was really miserable. Anyway, I decided I wasn't going back to university in the same city as her and that I was going to take the year off to pull myself back together. 

When she heard from friends that I wasn't doing well she called me and asked me point blank if I was alright. I told her straight up that I wasn't, that I'd been dealing with a lot of guilt about how I'd treated her in the last few months of our relationship and how wrong headed I'd been. I told her that I'd been dealing with depression and that I hoped it helped to explain some of my behaviour. 

Since then she contacts me fairly often and we have long conversations like the kind we had when we were together. I also find it odd that she regularly calls me on a Friday or Saturday night and talks with me for a whole evening. A few weeks ago she texted me 4 times and then finally called me because she wanted to send me a christmas card.

There were problems in our relationship, there were things that I wasn't happy with and obviously there were things that she wasn't happy with, but I feel that our relationship fell apart as a mix of hitting a 2 year down point and my depression. This time last year we were talking about moving in together. I think a lot of what happened was us failing to take our relationship to the next level. There were times where I was almost ready to break it off with her too.

We still talk, I don't know whether she's still dating that other guy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to ask. I'm doing my best to step away from the effects of the breakup, I've made new friends in the city where I'm living now, I've gone on dates, I've been seeing my therapist and have been making progress with fighting my depression.

I need to work on myself, I need to meet new people, date new people, I need to drive back my depression. But, at the same time, I'd be lying if I said that I don't have any sort of small idea that me and her might try again some time, when we're both at better more mature places in our lives.
 
The only thing is I can't be sure that she isn't just contacting me out of pity. Would you keep in contact with someone just because  She seems to be fairly genuine about things as they are. I guess I'm just looking for a bit of input on why you think someone would stay in contact with their ex the way she seems fairly adamantly trying to stay in contact with me. 

TL;DR: Had a bad split with first girlfriend, she left me and started dating fairly soon afterwards. Months later we are trying to stay friends and she is definitely making an effort to keep me fairly close. Why do you think that is?
 




 You need to get somewhere safe and away from him. I'm sorry, I'm sure you love him on his fair weather days, but what he is doing is not okay whatsoever. For your own well being. 




 I do it all the time, in fact, I'd go as far to say I've created a charming, funny and extroverted character that I use as a buffer between myself and the outside world. I smile, I joke, I flirt, I wouldn't say it's manic like in bipolar disorder, but it's a falsity that I use to protect myself.

At work today a customer told me that I do such a good job making people happy, that I'm a positive for everyone that comes into the cafe I work at. I spent most of my day fantasizing about killing myself. 

Sorry, this probably hasn't been helpful at all. 




 Yeah, that's unacceptable behaviour on his part, make it clear to him that if this doesn't improve than you're gone. Accusing you of cheating without the smallest piece of evidence is ridiculous and dramatic and you should tell him that. 




 Yeah.. I think relationships are a little more complicated than you make them out to be. Not to say that his behaviour is acceptable, it isn't, but I think you're stretching a little bit.

 Should she be careful incase his behaviour doesn't improve. yes. Is it helpful to tell her that this guy *will* destroy her life, probably not. 




 I will agree with other posters that your boyfriend's behaviour is unacceptably invasive, but at the same time I do, as a man, sympathize with that kind of insecurity. I'm of the school of thought that most single males have less than platonic goals if they start showing interest in a girl who is in a relationship. It's an easy assumption and more often than not it's right. 

All that being said you're boyfriend is obviously not just being the normal level of defensive, he's taking it way too far. You shouldn't have to show him all the past of your electronic communication if you don't want to, that's a boundary that you've set.  I'm not usually one to dish out the "break up" advice which is often given ad nauseum on this subreddt, but if your boyfriend doesn't seriously take your feelings on this into consideration and continues to freak out, I don't think you'll have many more directions to take. If you've communicated your issue with his behaviour to him, and he hasn't tried to compromise to achieve a healthy middle ground than it's probably time to move on.

This is coming from someone who's ex-girlfriend actually left me for a "guy friend" so I hope that I'm a tempered response.  




 Seriously, you're both wrong, you pushed him, he hit you in the leg. Learn to not fight like children or don't be in a relationship, simple.  




 People with depression, particularly males, often do exhibit increased aggression or irritability. If OP's bf is depressed his behaviour isn't entirely out of place. 




 I have isolated myself. I've moved across the country to live with my parents in a city I don't know. I am alone, the only people I talk to on a semiregular basis are people from work and my exgirlfriend. She left me for someone else, I was a shitty boyfriend, I was desperate and afraid. I've told her about my depression, and how I wish I'd known I was depressed at the time. I wish I could talk to her more often, or open up and be candid with her, I really miss her. I know I won't find someone as unique and special as her. I feel cold and alone. I imagine this is a similar feeling to being caught in the wilderness, knowing you're going to freeze to death, but having no way of stopping it. I've tried so hard to get out of this, I've been exercising, writing, seeing a therapist, taking medication, I just can't make it stop. No one values me, I think my ex only talks to me out of pity, I'm unneeded, replaceable, and unhappy.   




 I miss you, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about you. After all of these months of putting together the pieces, like an expert piecing back together a plane after a horrible crash, I finally have a good picture and can say that this was all my fault. If I could see you now I'd hug you and tell you how sorry I am, and that I don't really know what to do or who I am right now but I'm trying anyway. I never imagined that we'd end up this way, or that I'd be where I am right now. I know you've found love with someone else and all I can think is how much you deserve someone who's better than me. How were you ever supposed to love me when I can't love myself?, when deep down I'm so fundamentally twisted up inside. You have a good heart to have ever been able to love someone like me. You probably don't think too kindly of me these days, the only person to blame for that is me. 

These days I don't know if I'll ever be able to stand on my own two feet again. We talk now and then, but I don't know if I've let on how beaten out of the race I really am. So many "what ifs" run through my brain everyday; "What if I hadn't gotten sick?" "What if I'd been more patient" "What if I wasn't scared." We both wish I could just leave it in the past and move forward, but I just can't. I'm too afraid.

I miss coming home to you, I miss watching movies, just talking in the shower and going for walks through the nice end of town. I miss how we'd snuggle close to each other before falling asleep, how your legs and arms would get cold so you'd curl around me. I miss when it was just me and you under blankets in the backs of cars and listening to songs from the 80's. I miss you calling me late at night to ask if I wanted to go smoke cigars in the rain and then waiting for me to kiss you. 

All of that seems so far away now, like a dream, like something that never happened. I've lost you, you're so far away now, and I'm so afraid that I'm losing myself too. All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery. I'm cold, bitter, and a worse man than I was before, maybe I've always been worse. I really hope you find real happiness, and no matter what happens to me, if I don't pull myself back, and can never stand by on my own again, it's not because of you.



 




 Yeah with pop music (rock, trance, top 40, any of that stuff) they'd be somewhere between bored and revolted. 




 I've started smoking over the past year because, A) I really like the flavour, it's relaxing and lets me think alone and B) I know that it might possibly kill me one of these days. I've never self harmed, but this is a much more passive way of doing so I suppose and that seems to suit me. 




 I'm actually a he, and was dating a she. I was feeling very well at the time, I was beginning my last year of high school felt like I finally had something to look forward to. She was my best friend and I'd started to have feelings for her. We were together for two years, I became depressed during my first year of university, started hating myself, didn't treat her as well as I should have, this was before I was diagnosed. She broke up with me, and with good reason. I've since started getting help and am trying to do better, but I'm in no condition to be in a relationship with anybody. 




 Sounds a lot like depression to me. I've been diagnosed and can really relate to the completely not feeling anything, as well as the rare anger episode. For me, the anger feels like something other than the nothingness so it's difficult to control when it does happen. If you're feeling this way please go talk to someone and find some help. 




 Well from my own personal experience I was experiencing a brief period off feeling normal when I started a relationship with my now ex. I had my most severe episode of depression and was entirely undiagnosed. It really did screw up my relationship, I've done so many things that I regret. I don't know how I'd even go about starting a relationship now.  




 I ended up resenting my ex like crazy, which was a painful situation in and of itself, while we were dating. Coincidentally, she was really pushing for us to move in together earlier this year, but I said it wasn't a good time for multiple reasons. I'm glad that I didn't have to struggle through a living situation as well, just the emotional turmoil. I hope things work out for you. 




 I was just on the receiving end of this with my ex. She wasted my time for 2 years when I could have been meeting new girls and having fun in college. She led me on for a very, very long time and then ended up leaving me high and dry when someone else came along. You want to fuck someone up badly, do that. Please by all means break up with him, just don't be surprised if he never talks to you again. 




 I think death by spiders is fairly high up there on the list of ways I don't want to die. 




 Yeah, I find when I'm low I usually get pretty paranoid, especially about spiders. I actually slept with the light on for a few months because I was terrified there would be a spider somewhere near me. I've always had trouble with paranoia and falling asleep though, I'm a 20 years old and more or less scared of the dark, when I'm depressed anyway. 




 It's strange actually, me and my psychologist have both brought it that I probably don't know how to conduct myself in a normal way. I'm dysfunctional even when I am feeling alright because I don't know how to manage not feeling horrible. I've lived with depression so long that if I ever want to be healthy I have to learn how to conduct myself when I'm not feeling that way. 




 Yeah, that'd get you started. I really don't have any answers for you, all I can say is don't be too hard on yourself, don't let it consume you, realize that even if there is no grand scheme objective meaning that you can still apply meaning to things and people. Hopefully you come out of your crisis on the other end a more complete and aware person. 

The best advice I can give is to be aware of your limitations and realize the potential you have. As a human you are limited and it's a difficult thing to accept. Best of luck. 




 Well it'd probably help if you describe your existential crisis a little more. I mean, what started it? have you been reading philosophy/literature? 

 I don't think it's something everyone goes through, I think it requires a certain level of introspection that a lot of people lack. There is a difference between that phase where you're trying to figure out what you want to do for a career and an existential crisis. 

I will say that if you're having a full blown existential crisis then you probably won't find a solid answer to your questions. What you will find is a cornucopia of different thoughts and ways of conducting a life. Take what you find enriching and leave the rest
