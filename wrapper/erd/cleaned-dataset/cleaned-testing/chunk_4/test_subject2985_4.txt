 I don't know, this is the first time I've heard anybody say "I like him but he'll lose" in a while. I think his supporters pre-maturely declaring defeat for him was a very big hurdle, and I think he's pretty much overcome it. 




 Have we done a promotional post in /r/SandersForPresident or any of the other relevant subs? I know I'd have subscribed a while ago, but just found the sub today. 




 Is it really fair to count Santorum himself? 




 Do you ask that question of gas station price signs, too? 




 The whole thing is seriously messed up:

 I usually base it on positioning and mobility. If you're a "slower character" (e.g. hammer, brightwing, rehgar), or if I'm between you and your base, you're getting kicked. Otherwise, it's whoever is being the most annoying. 




 Here's [a video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks) instead! 




 Republicans can get away with that because old people (their base) vote and young people (their opponents' base) don't. That's why the country is significantly more liberal than the government. 




 That's you asking someone to do that for you. It's not an established, widespread industry of pushers. 




 Is that how it worked when alcohol became legalized? Do you know many alcohol dealers selling beer to kids on street corners? 




 So vote Sanders? Got it. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 The difference is that everyone is saying that Bernie is only in it to pull Hillary to the left. He's saying that that's not true. He's in it to win.

Nobody doubts that all of the republicans are fighting to get to the top of the crazy pile. 




 The problem is, that base actually votes. 




 Same. 




 Ah, good. It sucks when people do this, I'm glad that there's significant discouragement.

Thanks! 




 I very strongly disagree with this:

 its going to cause youths to smoke it more since its been legitimized by the government.

Besides the fact that that's a pretty illogical statement (legalization might lessen the stigma, but it certainly won't *cause* anyone to use), the reverse will undoubtedly be true. Weed, at the moment, is essentially entirely unregulated, and many kids choose weed over beer because it's easier to get.

CVS isn't going to sell to a minor, but dealers have zero problem with it. Make pot legal and you get rid of most of the dealers. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 And, amazingly, it works :( 




 /r/gogopgo 




 This is super fun and effective (you wouldn't believe some of the escapes I've had doing this), but it doesn't explain the necessity for Tyrael to pause while throwing the sword. 




 Proposed Tyrael trait alternative:

**Archangel's Timeliness**

El'Druin's Might shows how much time remains for Tyrael to teleport.

You can't deny that that'd be a hell of a lot more useful than Archangel's Wrath. 




 First sentence:

Following comments Donald Trump made about Mexican immigrants during his presidential announcement last week,

There's also this:

"When do we beat Mexico at the border?" Trump said during his lengthy presidential announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York. "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

And this:

Trump's comments are just the type the Republican Party has been looking to avoid. The Republican National Committee underwent serious self-reflection following President Obama's re-election, initiating an "autopsy" of what went wrong. It determined it had to reach out to minorities to strike a more inclusive tone.

And this:

The controversy seems unlikely to fade, especially now that Trump is an official candidate for president. With his high name recognition, he places highly in many polls and is likely to be included in the first two Republican presidential debates scheduled for August.

This entire article is about a US presidential candidate making several highly offensive comments during his announcement that he is running for president, and a major media corporation severing ties due to the nature of those comments, as well as the impact that it has on said candidate's party.

How is that not about current American politics?

 We're gonna win this thing. And then the other thing!

 They've been in a severe downward spiral for a while now. I unfollowed them from my Facebook stream them a while back. This has earned them the full unlike. 




 Very well put! 




 I know. Better late than never, but 2015 was a really freaking long time to wait for marriage equality. 




 I think we'll just have to agree to disagree.

For what it's worth, I'm a huge supporter of both gay rights and Bernie, so I'm glad that this has visibility. 




 If only the title were better. 




 It's not that it's not relevant. It's just counter to the campaign that Bernie is trying to run. I think if you asked him, he wouldn't want to see things like this posted here. 




 I guess my issue is it being posted here. Post it in /r/politics, /r/hillaryclinton, /r/lgbt, etc.. It doesn't really have anything to do with Bernie, and Bernie seems entirely uninterested (and unwilling) to discuss the positions of his opponents, let alone highlight something negative. 




 /r/mildlyinteresting 




 This doesn't belong here. Bernie repeatedly refuses to go negative, and so should we. 




 You'd think, but I think people see it as superfluous. 




 And we haven't even gotten the marriage equality win yet! 




  Hope we continue in the left direction.

FTFY ;) 




 Interesting. I wonder how many would vote for a democratic socialist, since Sanders is not a socialist. 




 Ha! 




 I agree. 




 Thank you. It helps a bit to know that vestibular rehab isn't 100% verified to work, though I would still think that someone would have brought it up as a possibility along the way. 5 years is a long time to try nothing.

I don't recall what the first ENT did, this was like 8 years ago, but as far as I can remember, the most we got out of anyone was "That sucks. Good luck!" So probably nothing. 




 Thank you. 




 Agreed on all counts! 




 Really his biggest hurdle is his own would-be supporters pre-declaring defeat for him. I know that's not what you're saying here, but the most common thing I hear about him is "Yeah, he's the ideal candidate and he'd make a great president, but he can't win", and I think a lot of people say that because a lot of other people say it. 




 Really? You think he needs a wig? 




 That's fine in theory, but it's not what happens in practice. We desperately need to replace the dysfunctional FPTP system. The good news is that we've begun to. RCV is growing around the country. 




 In unrelated news, McDonald's is looking for a new meat supplier. 




 The dismount button should be able to be moved to a different button than the mount button. 




 Sad, true, and frustration. 




 Good for you for getting involved a such a young age, though. We need more young people taking an interest in politics and government. The government is sadly far more conservative than the people, because old people vote and young people don't. 




 [I quite agree.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD) 




 Weird. Sorry you had that experience, especially since you've already donated.

Try it in incognito mode. Maybe the fact that you've already donated is causing the problem. 




 This is fun, and I would play the hell out of it, if it counted towards golden hero wins. Sadly, though, I'm probably just going to keep grinding ranked wins to hopefully get my first golden hero by the end of the year. Chances aren't great.

 Even when he's supporting libertarian positions? You don't think that's relevant to libertarians? 




 Thank you. 




 We should not decriminalize theft and burglary. That's absurd.

Yes, we should decriminalize prostitution. 




 The answer is treating it like a medical problem, not a legal one. You're right, prevention is the key, and locking people up is not preventing anything. It's only making them more desperate, giving them fewer options, and surrounding them with more criminals.

TL;DR - Decriminalization. 




 Not really sure how debates are bad for the people, I would argue that the opposite is true, but I definitely agree that they're good for Bernie.  




 I consider the legalization of marijuana to be a libertarian issue, so I post things related to it here. Sorry if you feel it's off topic. 




 I'm down for everything except for the "instead" part. I like being able to see how long until the next one starts.

Other than that, I agree! 




 It's probably a sticker. 




 The first one should be free, and then it's $15 for another 3.

My first one was free. 




 I think I might be done with the PTR:

* No progression
* No talents
* No new hero
* Lots of lag
* 75% chance of playing a map I could play on the regular server that doesn't suffer from those other problems

Might be a different story if there was more to test or if there wasn't such horrendous lag (I never lag on the real servers). 




  Do you have TWC?

Thankfully no. I live in one of the few places in the US where I've got a second ISP to choose from.

 Nope. NA.

 Really, the amount of total actions take in a game is small enough that I think it's reasonable to expect every game to be saved for replay. 




 3 questions:

1. Would it be reversable?
2. Would it work for astigmatisms?
3. Would I feel it in my eye long term? 




 More to the point, who isn't yesterday? 




 The GOP: the party of small government, personal liberty, and free markets. /s 




 I'd love one, if you still have one. 




 ELI5 the difference? 




 That's why I'm a big fan of early voting. Makes it a lot easier for people to get out to vote if they have options and more than one day to do it.

I'm excited to see online voter registration becoming more prevalent, too. 




 Old people vote, young people don't. That's the sad reality that has made this happen. 




 I don't see what's wrong with Title + quote, as long as the end result is still representative of the article.

I think something is being lost here. 




 And surviving teammates, please, PLEASE act as though you're down a hero. Because you are. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a teammate die, followed by one of my other teammates starting (yes, starting) a team fight with the 5 enemies that just got the kill.

Repeat after me:

By Grapthar's Hammer, you shall be amazed at how I wisely fall back and safely soak/defend by (preferably behind) our towers until our team is no longer at a significant disadvantage!

Of course you can't just give the enemy full map control every time one of your teammates goes down, but you do have to acknowledge their advantage and play accordingly. If the enemy is up 2-3 heroes, they're going to take a boss, your mercs, a fort, etc.. That's their reward, let them have it, and don't add to it if you can't deny them safely and sensibly.

TL;DR - Don't get dead, too. 




 /r/gogopgo 




  It was never brought up again.

Why not? Did he cancel Cinemax? 




 Might be if we can get his supporters to stop preemptively declaring defeat. He's rocketing up in the polls, but the pessimism is as thick as ever. 




 I am absolutely convinced that there is no greater mistake you can make than attacking your own teammates. There's absolutely no point to it, it causes a lot of damage, and it's incredibly easy to avoid (step only: don't do it). 




 Then if you don't mind a suggestion, stop saying that it won't happen. If you're right, then it won't have changed anything, but by trying to declare defeat for him early, all you're really doing is making it more likely. There's no upside to it.

He's got quite an uphill battle, and one of the major hurtles is the fact that everyone keeps saying that he can't win, because everyone keeps saying that he can't win. It's really amazing how much progress that he's making, and at how fast he's closing the gap, given the fact that even his own supporters are trying to convince everyone that he won't win.

Let the guy win. 




  It's not going to happen.

Unless it does. 




  Shouldn't Clinton be answering those instead of blacking out the media.

I love that that's always his response, too. "I'll let her state her position on that." Every single time.

He could easily smear or attack her. He doesn't. "Ask her, don't ask me".

Please elect this man. We need him. 




 Dude directly and succinctly answers every single question that doesn't involve smearing his opponent.

[berniesanders.com](http://www.berniesanders.com), let's get this guy elected! 




 Politicians who are consistent to and clearly state their beliefs make me cringe, too. It's especially cringeworthy when they directly and succinctly answer every question that doesn't involve smearing their opponent.

Good call. 




 I think that this is a good suggestion. I also think that the card would be just fine as is for 7 mana. 




 The article refers to homicides, not gun deaths. 




 Just call and ask. 




 I don't know. I think a minimum wage with basic income is kind of redundant, as well as unnecessary. If people no longer have to work to survive, they can be more selective, and a market-driven fair price should surface.

In theory, anyway. 




 My first thought, too. Even taking the fact that the child was shot out of the equation, I'm willing to bet that the circumstances under which the dog was shot at would have been enough to land a civilian in jail.

We really need to stop this "shoot first, ask questions later" approach to law enforcement (which this wasn't even). 




 Thank you! 




 Oh man, an entire realm to test Tyrael's trait (which they're surely not going to go another patch without addressing)? That's great! It must be big. Big and not requiring Tyrael to die to use it.

Assumptions! 




 Mind ELI5'ing SB5 and how we told him to shove it up his ass? 




 I've always wondered about this as well. You'd think they'd be against a frivolous law that arbitrarily increases the number of criminals and arrests (and thus potentially violent confrontations). You'd also think that the decrease in alcohol consumption would be appealing to them, since drunk people tend to be a lot more out of control than high people (who are generally mellow and happy). 




 We really need to start calling him "The Sand Viper". 




 /r/gogopgo 




 His last name is **Sand**ers... 




 Great (and amusing) write-up. I agree with just about everything, especially this:

it's a shit trait with shit mechanics that rewards shit play and should be shitkicked into a shitpile located...

this:

I would like to see the persistent range check removed. If I am in range to start it up, barring a hearth it should go off.

and this:

TL;DR I love Tyrael. Let me love him more.

 The only thing that I disagree with is that I typically take Angelic Absorption at 13. Am I missing out here? 




 The decriminalization measure, which cleared the House earlier this month, passed despite significant opposition from police groups and Republicans.

 It seems I have officially passed the Turing Test. 




 That's different from what OP experienced. Rage guy was upset that OP picked Azmodan period. Not because of some counter or comp issue. 




 Yeah, but usually if your tank is down it doesn't matter much. You'd be much better off if your tank had a trait that helped keep him alive. 




 Just sharing things where appropriate. 




 I think we can expand this:

If you lost a game when you were on a team with an Azmo, it's typically not because you had an Azmo.

To something a little more broad:

If you think you lost a game because you were on a team with a specific hero, it's typically not because of you were on a team with that hero. It's more likely that you're just bad. 




 Depends on the sub, but regardless, it's generally a good practice. I try not to editorialize my titles. 




 This. I main Tyrael and 95% of the games that I play it does absolutely nothing, and the remaining 5% of the time it almost never results in an actual kill or significant impact on a fight. It's just terrible.

I suppose I could die more often to get more mileage out of it, but I'd rather they just give him an actual, useful trait. 




 That's the article's title... 




 It's not even Christianity. It's a couple lines in the old testament.

100% guarantee Jesus would support gay rights today. He was incredibly liberal and accepting, based on everything that he says in The Bible. He'd be pretty appalled that ignorant and intolerant people use His name to discriminate against others.

I really don't get why the right is considered the party of Christianity, other than the fact that they try and legislate out of the bible (the limited parts of it that they key in on). Their platform of greed, intolerance, judgement, and hate is pretty counter to everything that Jesus said and stood for. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 The US has over 300,000,000 people. At 3 per 100,00, that's over 9,000 firearm homicides per year. Not 90.

The statistics shown are per 100,000 people. 




 Sad. She's in my top 5 of wanted heroes. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 I wonder how many are human... 




 I was actually just joking. Vikings in SC2 are a counter to colossi. 




 I love this game, but this just one of *many* UI/UX no-brainers that need resolving. 




 Tyrael's charger looks cool, but I wish it were a little more sleek. It's kinda... round. 




 Leoric's master skin looks better than most. Like most master skins, I don't think it looks better than his default skin, but it also doesn't look stupid like most of the master skins. 




 I love the idea of a Colossus specialist! They were my favorite unit in SC2. Really powerful, but very fragile.

The Vikings should deal bonus damage to him. 




 The Vikings are an example of Blizzard looking beyond the cross-promotional benefits of releasing heroes from actively marketed games, so I think that D2 heroes are a real possibility. 




  Actually, I'd legit love for Heroes of the Storm to bring in characters from other companies games. Get Ryu from Street Fighter in there (he will be in ANYTHING, and would be easy to add, fireball, dragon punch, hurricane kick)

Sorry, but this would be horrible. Honestly, I think that's the worst part about Smash Brothers, and I would hate to see that happen to Heroes. 




 Sign me up! 




 I don't think things like Nova's Amazon skin precludes the possibility of an Amazon hero. Don't forget, Valla essentially has a Tyrael skin. 




  Republicans use religion when it's convenient.

FTFY 




 It is kind of ridiculous that since I own Jaina, if I buy the Jaina skin bundle, I'm effectively just buying the winter skin for more money than if I just bought it without the bundle. 




  They want it to be presented in better ways than just icons at the bottom of the screen which they feel wasn't good enough.

That makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is removing them until said better solution is in place. Even if they weren't ideal, the old icons were better than nothing.

That said, I'm sure there was a technical reason for doing so. 




 Couldn't agree more.

 I meant starting with Johanna's release. I worded it poorly. 




  i wonder if we will get wizard as well

I really hope so. Would love to see alternative Diablo heroes as well, such as a male frenzy barb. 




 Right? He looks absolutely amazing. That's a 15k hero right there. 




 One of the things that I love about this game is that the supports can still do considerable damage. 




 Johanna's super fun, and Leoric looks amazing. Excited to see what comes up the monk, as well. 




 [Or is it...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HMeW2hg6Hc) 




 He tweeted 4 hours ago, so yeah, seems so. 




 This is my concern as well. Someone doesn't show up to goblins and it leads to resentment. 




 Is he gone? 




 I think this might be an idea to address that. 




 I think you might have missed the point. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 Johanna. I meant a span of 9 weeks, starting with her. 




 No, it's a known issue. 




 I main Tyrael, so I use Judgement a lot (often unsuccessfully). 




 Auriel and Malthiel are at the top of my list of wants. 




 Pylo! 




 No argument here! A ranged warrior sounds awesome. 




  Crossing my fingers for a Starcraft themed map and heroes.

Yeah, thought about saying something like that in my post, but didn't want to push our luck :P. I think the Diablo characters are the coolest and most interesting, but Starcraft is definitely my favorite of the three universes, and I'd love to see more protoss and zerg enter the mix, especially a zealot. 




 We also need to get our people to stop saying "he can't win, don't bother". I think that's his biggest obstacle. 




 I just think if I use the ability within range, it should fire The way it is now it seems like this is the flow:

1. Check if target is in range.
2. Dismount, stop moving, and say "Embrace Judgement".
3. Check if target is in range.
4. Fire.

If the target was in range when I cast it, the ability should fire. Otherwise, the ability's max range is effectively lower than it appears. It sucks having to get closer than max range to actually use the ability.

Really the other issue is the bigger one, though. Countless times (including twice yesterday) I'll click on one enemy and Tyrael will charge another. Drives me nuts, especially because it's often a full health warrior that gets hit instead of the 10% health assassin that I clicked on.

EDIT: Also, your username is cool and very Rehgarish. 




 Thanks. Missed that. 




 Don't forget gang violence and cartel activities (trafficking other drugs, guns, people, etc.). Certainly helps fund those things as well. 




 Probably has something to do with the site's metadata. 




 The evidence suggests both. 




 Thank you for doing this. 




 I sure hope so. Auriel is towards the top of my list of heroes that I want to see. Really member any of the angiris council would be awesome. 




  It would decrease the afkers at map start thats for sure :)

No more loading screen redditing for this guy! 




  Reddit is VERY far left of America as whole,

That may be (at least partially) true, but something to consider is that America is also significantly more liberal than the government, due to the fact that old people vote and young people don't. 




 I don't see a priest buff. What am I missing? 




 Tyrael. 




 Judgement is very buggy. It often hits the wrong target, and if you use it at max range and the enemy moves even slightly farther away, it misfires. 




 That's a conservative estimate. I was thinking at least 15.

 If you don't want to see articles about US politics, you might not want to hang out in /r/uspolitics. 




 That's some solid analysis right there. 




  The taxes are on cigarettes and sales which everyone, rich or poor, will have to pay. The progressive writer who produced this garbage of course will conclude it as an assault against the poor.

You really don't see how a tax like that has a greater impact on the poor? 




 That is a [systemic problem \(video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD).

Used to have respect for Ratsmah. That kind of took a hit here, and I was definitely hoping he would end up losing due to his dickery. 




  update with what I learn.

Please do. Would love to hear. 




 I know. Wish I could do something about that :( 




 Not sure about that. I don't think the text changed at all (correct me if I'm wrong). It just had a limited number of demons that it could summon, and now it can summon practically all of them. I would say that that's the original functionality and intention of the card. 




 I wouldn't call that a buff. It was more like a fix. 




 If you hate Tyrael, the game is doing you a favor. He's amazing, but requires some practice and a very solid understanding of the game. Give him a shot! 




 In order:

* Sky Temple
* Dragonshire
* Tomb of the Spider Queen
* Blackheart's Bay
* Cursed Hollow
* Haunted Mines
* Garden of Terror

Love the first 3, hate the bottom 2. 




 Yeah, but with nova's amazing wave clear and structure damage, she should be able to clear out the fort before the tribute even spawns. 




 I meant it's not going to disincentive people from working. Nobody is going to consider that enough. 




 Supports yes. Healers, not necessary. 




  There will fewer options because people at the bottom won't challenge the people above them.

This is the part that I really disagree with. $12,000 per year isn't going to disincentive anyone. Nobody's ambition ends with "not starving". I really think you'll see a large productivity increase, because people will be doing the work that they choose, not that they need to survive.

Really, though, at the end of the day, the most compelling reason for basic income is the fact that automation and efficiency are crushing jobs, and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate. They're going to increase the already growing wealth gap, and we're simply not going to have enough jobs for people. Moreover, with 99% of all new wealth headed straight to the 1%, we're going to find that it would be in everyone's best interest (the ultra rich included) for that money to circulate, rather than to accumulate. Basic income solves both of those problems. 




 As a heroes player, well done!

As a Tyrael main, fuck you. 




 Drives me crazy when a tribute is announced near the bottom, and top lane sits there for 30 seconds and THEN comes down. Even if you get there exactly as the fight starts (which is unlikely), you've put your team at a significant disadvantage, as the enemy has had the chance to position themselves favorably. Chances are, though, if you're coming that late that at least one of your teammates will be dead by the time you get there.

Be where the fight is, and please, get there early. 




  Of course it's your fault when he dies.

Every time. 




  So now the government is paying for people to be with their families?

The government is guaranteeing that, no matter the circumstances, every one of its citizens has enough to ensure their basic needs of survival. How they choose to spend their extra time is up to them. For 99.99999%, this will undoubtedly be working. They'll simply have more options as to what that means. 




 Almost nobody would stop working. Many would do different things, but very few people would be content to live on $12,000 per year. The poor, especially, would continue working, as they've got more incentive to do so (since they're, well, poor).

Personally i expect Americans to just pocket the money and make more money.

Yup. That's the idea. Though with the added buffer and safety net, they're be more likely to seek out work that they enjoy or are more suited towards. Some might even drop down to part time to spend more time on their families, or doing things that they find valuable, but might not be all that profitable (charity, art, community development, etc.).
