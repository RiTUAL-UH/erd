 I second the whiskey thing. Just don't be cheap with it. I HATE cheap financially and cheap tasting whiskey. 




 I mega-loathe this. I'm always thinking or quietly saying "Parking spaces are for cars you incompetent asshole! Quit fucking leaving your carts in parking spaces. Lazy fucking pricks. There are cart returns just about every few spots. Stop being dicks." I hate those people. 




 Yes on the first one. No Aaron Paul for me please. 




 Breaking Bad. Well just for Skyler. 




 Yes. Poor me :'( 
Financially, I'm poor.
Edit: my name is John 




 Married here. You've got a lot right. Except you have all of it wrong. Well we fight. Who doesn't enjoy a good storm off? Seriously though. We try like crazy for her to get pregnant but with no luck. Well there is luck... bad luck. 




 Having the use of a crazy old guy and some punk kid's time machine to bring a sports almanac back to myself and make a fortune from betting on sports. 




 I have sleep paralysis almost every night. Sometimes it includes a demon of sorts and sometimes it's just the paralysis. There's been times where it's a guy that's about as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the eighties. He usually hides in the corner of the room dry humping a bed that only exists with him. He wears a hat like a drill sergeant. Other times it's an evil presence without any shadow or physical appearance. The evil presence is always accompanied by a feeling of something weighing me down like pressure on my chest. There's been times where it's a shadow that whispers my name. I end up asking my wife if it was her though really I know what it was.
When this happens I watch comedy on Netflix to clear my mind and get back to sleep. I discovered new (to me) comedians like John Pinette with this method.

I'm not sure if it's related to sleep paralysis, but I have dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis like symptoms at the end of a dream. Such dreams involve me living life as usual and suddenly I'm transported to a different place. This place is usually a desert and it's usually dark. I can only see about a five foot radius around myself and everything else is pitch black but not like night black but sharpie marker black. I just start floating around and of course I find it fun... at first. Then I float to this area that has like prison bars behind me. I can't control the floating anymore and it's creepy. I then hear a little kid's voice whispering and screaming all at once. The kid is whisper screaming "help me, please!" "Please help!" I turn around and behind the bars is a little kid, terrified. The kid's eyes are just eye sockets and blood drips down from the sockets. I scream a very high pitched scream that can be heard in the waking world. It's a scream I can not mimic while awake. Before my wife wakes me up, I'm paralysed the same as when I have a more standard sleep paralysis episode. 




 Fuck! I now have more shit to worry about visiting me.  




 I have sleep paralysis almost every night. If this image came to me, then I would just die. Fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck it. Nope nope nope nope nope nope. 




 I've thought about this. I would have a two bedroom apartment what with the extra money. The food and what not wouldn't be a problem refer to extra money above. With two jobs a piece, no time to hate one another. Outside of work I'm usually with my wife somewhere outside of the house anyway. Plus it's just a fun thought. 




 Get a 100% clone of myself so I can work two jobs and so can my clone. No more money problems. Since I don't spend very much money, I'd have a lot saved. 




 I just let them go. If you don't like it, too bad. I pass people everyday that do far worse than something that occurs naturally such as farting. 




 I have man's jeans (I don't mean those bs skinny jeans either) and my pockets suck ass. 




 Seconded 




 Or why they're traumatized when seeing a deer carcass being skinned in the front lawn. 




 I'll sound like a noobbut I don't care. How to properly delete a Facebook account? 




 I take this to be a breaking bad reference. I may be wrong. 




 If I could change things. I'd change how a lot of stuff happened. I definitely wouldn't be so stupid to lose my job. 




 Hopefully 2014 will have less government shut downs than 2013. 




 I haven't read all the comments on this, but I think I'm the only one or at least one of the only ones who understood the reference. 




 Makes plenty sense to me 




 I recognized the reference right away. I have watched that movie so many times. Just watched it again last night. 




 I was ranting in traffic about this. Most people can use a blinker without even taking their hands of the wheel. It takes very little effort. Stop being so damn lazy! 




 I put my foot down. I go away from the light as swiftly as possible. Passengers in my car tell me to slow down like I'm in the wrong. 




 I hate this with a passion. If you wanted to be in the outside lane, you should have been in the proper FUCKING LANE TO BEGIN WITH! Fucking assholes! 




 I know someone who does this. He justifies it with "if I just go, and there isn't a gap won't I get hit?" "Stopping instead of driving into traffic that's moving more than 70mph seems logical." Can anyone help me explain an alternative? 




 My carrier has a plan that lets you pay $20/month I believe and you get 250 calling minutes and unlimited text/picture messages. If the calls are made to and received from a phone on the same network or during nights and weekends, it doesn't count toward your minutes. Perfect for being contacted by potential employers. 




 It's not always someone who couldn't afford them from the start. Sometimes the parents could easily afford having kids and have no trouble doing so. It only takes one financial catastrophe to change the whole situation. I know people who financially had no issues supporting kids and had a financial crisis. Now they have welfare and food stamps. They aren't at fault for things out of their control. Not every family that is struggling to raise kids on poor income are at fault. Not to say that some people are just being irresponsible. 




 I do that a lot. Most of the timethey pass. 




 I know someone who bought the waxvac. It was only good at disappointing. 




 Try to get a savings account built up that consists of at least three months of bills (rent, utilities, cell phone, car insurance/note if necessary and any other bare necessity bills). This is important in case you lose your job. I was homeless for three months after I got laid off from my job. Took me by shock.  




 Don't be afraid to make your friends pay to stay if they plan to stay more than a month. 




 I had those before. Ate them in one sitting. No shame was felt. 




 Me too :-D 




 You monster! How could you say such vile things? 




 I went into the court house. We said "I do". 




 Lol that's what I meant. 




 I only do this if someone was halfway in my exhaust pipe
Edit: and decide to pass me like I'm in the wrong for going the speed limit.
Had to edit because I sent a partial message. 




 When I'm driving in front of you with my blinker on and you speed up to get in the turning lane at a red light. I was going to turn too asshat! Now I have to either get in the lane behind you and halfway stick out into the other lane or go straight through and turn around at the next opportunity. Fuck everyone who does this! The person driving in front of you has priority in this situation. You could wind up in my blind spot and then there is a wreck. Don't fucking do it! No no no no no. Fuck you! No. 




 My wife and I every time we go out. 




 I'm in the same boat. It sucks. 




 I fucking HATE that. I took it out on my way, it'll take you two seconds to replace it. FUCKING do it! 




 John Pinette's inner angry voice. "Get out of line!" 




 Omg hahaha! I have the same inner monologue. Did you get yours from monologue-Mart or is yours pre installed? I left the stock inner monologue installed.

Seriously though. I hate people like that. Don't go to Google.com the search bar does exactly that. It searches Google. Skip the middle man. 




 If anything I'm working on, cooking, using, etc drops. I can't stand to drop something. Even if it won't break or get ruined from dropping it. So much rage. 




 Yeah. Lincoln was still president then. 




 Internet exploder* 




 Leaving big tips at restaurants and other tipped wage earning places such as hotels. I usually tip no less than 50% or $30 whichever is greater. Makes me happy. 




 I used to pull the ink vessel from the makers and squeeze the colors into the glue. Stir with a tooth pick in random directions. Swirly. 




 Head phones? The way they're worn around here, I thought they were neck wear... Hmm. 




 I can't find the link and I used to have it on my phone. It's a black and white gif of a pug and this guy peaks around the wall and I think he says something to the dog and then leaves the scene. The dog then proceeds to freak out and cusses dude out.
Edit: found the gif on my phone. It's not black and white. I don't know how to post as comment. 




 Just the other day, I was driving with some asshat behind me. The asshat was so close behind me, I think she was partially in my exhaust pipe.
I was gonna make a left turn onto the street my apartment was on. I got in the turn lane to turn. She then proceeds to do the same thing but she got in front of me. I thought she was gonna continue to the nearby light. No. She was turning onto the same street as I was.
I thought that she might be in a hurry, so I tried not to let it bother me. When she pulled into the parking lot of the apartments (she lives in the same community as I), I waited. She sat in her car for ten minutes. She wasn't in a hurry, she was just being an asshat. As soon as she was inside her apartment, I put a bunch of bologna and I poured my entire gallon of water on her car (it's cold enough out to freeze her car shut). When I went outside earlier, she was using an ice scraper to remove it all. Little round patches of missing paint and a very pissed off asshat.
Don't fucking cut me off.
It's probably the worst I've done to someone. 




 Where was this at? I ask because some time ago, this guy in front of me almost completely stopped and so did I. The guy behind me didn't and ran off the road. His car flipped and caught fire.
