 Here's the thing, the giants are the big picture when it comes to getting to the Super Bowl.  We saw what happened this year, Harbs saw, we all saw it.  We need to get it down the field against them, no check downs, none of that.   




 This is gold.  Thank you 




 Trade him to the Chiefs for Eric Berry.  They need a qb, and we could use a corner 




 Blinded by the light 




 Every Alex lover is so quick to bring up stats to defend him its comical.  The fninshed product that was displayed today wasn't just today.  It's been brewing since training camp.  Harbs and the staff have been knowing this.  If you can't notice the difference of today's offense and Alex, I dunno what to tell you.  

Urban Meyer made Tebow look dope in the same offense Alex was in..  Still in denial?   




 It's not based off data.  It's the flow of the game, the way the offense flows.  Of course because your so hung up on Alex, you're too blinded to see a difference.   




 I.E last year and this years giants game . 




 Yeah try telling your argument to harbaughs face and see what he says.  I know your mad, I would be too.  But these years sticking up for alexis is done.  Get with it. You think Harbs really meant it when he said smith was a pro bowl qb last year?  Fuck no.   




 Look we're all fans of the same team, but the Alexsexuals need to go.  The door is to the right, thanks for playing. 




 Game, set, match  




 Doesn't want the camera on him  




 No love for South Brooklyn pizza? 









 #2 is spot on.   




 Plus bars stay open til 4 




 I've found some basic ones on Medzilla, and Cafe Pharma, but thought it wouldn't hurt to ask Reddit.  Anything would help. 




 Black Friday contradicts everything Thanksgiving stands for.   Just one day before we teach our kids about being thankful for everything in your life, and thievery next day we turn into savage assholes.  Only in America  




 Yes indeed, and any kind of mention of kaep gets down voted quick style.  
 




 Brady.   




 At the end of it all, what's your confidence level in Alex taking us to a Super Bowl?  I'm not saying kaep is it. In no way have I suggested that.  However given the small window we have, the room for errors is smaller than before 




 That's why we as fans let it be.  Plain and simple.  They see something we don't  




 In order to win history says you need a viable qb.  That's a fact.  Now whether or not Alex is that guy is not up To us.  But from what I've seen, kaep has done it more than Alex has in his given time. Whether he can do it for more than 2 years up is remained to be seem, but you can argue that there is a qb debate .  Like it or not  




 Name a Super Bowl winning qb other than Dilfer that has played it safe like Alex has.  There is none.  And the year after the Ravens won, they cut his ass.  Now, while i think Alex is better than Trent, why is there even mention of a qb controversey?  If Alex was doing what he's supposed to be doing, why is there talk of kaep? 




 At the end, the goal is to win a Superbowl.  And right now, what's standing between us and a Superbowl is a QB IMO.  My point of "pulling the trigger" means that we push the ball and make plays.  Not go for the safe read that Alex does over and over.  

I never mentioned once about entertainment in my post.  I'm saying Kaep is making plays, and is doing so in ways I haven't seen Alex do in the last 7 years.   




 I've been watching the games.  What I didn't emphasize in my post (which I should have) is that in 1 game, we saw Kaep pull the trigger more times than I've seen Alex.  

You provided proof in your post with plays he did, but in all honesty you're bringing up 2 plays from 2 different games.  .  I know it's only been 1 game with Kaep, but again he's not shy and he's pulling the trigger on plays.  The game you mentioned 80 yd bomb with Ted Ginn, Alex also missed a wide open Delanie Walker post 1st play of the game.  
And that's where I notice the contrast of QB's.  Alex is safe, cerebral, will not push it down field.  Kaep makes plays with his feet, often improvising which results in bigger plays.   




 Exactly this.  Not once have I ever seen Alex try and throw the 20 yard out pattern towards the sidelines.  Or go for the bomb.  If you watch the replay again, kaep does exactly that on the initial drive.  

Alex might have the "cerebral" aspect of the game, but kaep makes plays period.  Kaep has "it".  Alex, not as much  




 You got the cool ranch dorritos to top it off as well.   




 you made an asian sandwich, wouldn't call it banh mi  




 My gf wanted to go to his sushi/mex resto in Sacramento.  Reluctantly I agreed, easily the worst decision I ever made  




 I saw this post on Facebook earlier.  It said later nypd tried to wash away the body and evidence.   




 Getting married to my wife.  Shaking hands and meeting the Dalai Lama.   




 My friends were denied going into a club in Korea because of age.  Mind you, they're in their 30's.  And both were Korean 




 really appreciate this.  living in the east coast, i rarely get to watch highlights this long.   




 World travelers leaving stuff behind for the next traveler.  Sorta like a on going gift giving thing.  Leave something behind for the next person as well 




 I made it from Williamsburg to midtown in 12 minutes by carpool.  Once you get past the cops checking cars for 3 passengers, the freeways are relatively normal.  Getting to the on ramp is a pain 




 My personal hell which I have to deal with 2-3x a week.  Cubicle worker next to me clips her nails, clears her throat constantly, coughs, and talks on the phone while eating.  All 3 drive me bat shit 




 Incorrect.  Sushi rice has vinegar, sugar.  Onigiri is plain steamed japanese rice which can have flavors such as furikake, salt, kombu etc, but never vinegar.  Onigiri is onigiri.   




 So you know, sushi rice and onigiri are 2 different types of rice.   




 Stephen A is fuckin annoying, and it's clear ESPN loves and encourages his antics.  But what's annoying is he never played the game, he's a analyst.  If he were an ex player, even at the college lever I'd give him some respect.   




 Squirrel Master 




 Friend was the CEO 




 I'm always wondering how these NFL guys are wearing beats during pre game warmups.  Makes no sense whatsoever trying to run full speed with shitty headphones all.  

And they should know for the kind of money they're making, they could get amazing wireless ones.   




 A piece of advice a friend gave to me when I moved out here 3 years ago.  He said, "whatever effort you put into this city, whether it's meeting new people, going to events, etc..It comes back to you 10x"  

I took his advice to heart, and really pushed the boundaries.  To summarize, I met a amazing woman and got married last year.  As for my friend (the one with the advice), he came to NY with less than 1K in his bank account and minimal experience as a stylist.  He know styles hair for all the major fashion shoots, is known and respected internationally.  

Come out here and live the life you've wanted.  Go get it!   




 Glad to know the baby is doing better.  I know this might sound weird, but if Reddit is still around 20 years from now, I'd love to see the baby do AMA.  Your style of telling his story is quite interesting, and although it's sad, would love to know down the road how he turns out.   




 So often do you guys have sex in the kitchen?   




 and what? born n raised in cali as well.  you're talking a minute section of bushwick that has mexican immigrants, compared to cali where the influence is everywhere.   




 If it's martial arts poses, it goes like "Wah!!! Wata!!"   




 4-1 odds they still aren't legit like Cali.  NYC just can't do Mexi food for some reason or another 




 Because white people are the majority, they do what the fuck they please.  British and Aussie are still derivatives from the English language.  But the moment you take something foreign and "weird" sounding, and voila you get mocking/mimicking.  
For the record I'm asian, and have witnessed this shit everywhere.  People still do "ching chong", this and that, thinking it's funny.   




 They killed her because they wanted bike parts?   




 Bingo.  There's a bunch of east bay folks that are pro Niner/A's.   




 I find some of this hard to believe.  You really had no clue, no red flags, not even a inkling of a doubt before you got married?  As much as you're getting hurt here, you gotta look at yourself and ask how did you get  here?  Shit like this doesn't happen overnight.  What led to this, and why couldn't you see this happen earlier?  Man up, divorce and get to the root of you.  Both of you guys fucked up on this one. 




 I don't really follow college too much, but who are some good players coming out this that we can draft?  We need a DB/CB, and prob some DE's as well.   




 Lugers was good, but it wasn't mind blowing.  Keane's is pretty damn good   




 the one and only time ill fork over 30$ for a burger.  




 I sat next to someone the other day who ate that.  They said Minetta Tavern is hands down their favorite steak house, better than Peter Lugers, or Keanes.   




 Why is this in WTF?  has no bearing.   




 I'll be curious as to how far they went to duplicate this burger.  All the elements have to be in order, the right cheese, sauce, etc...Even Brit mayo is different than over here 




 This bitch had some annoying facial expressions 




 To further add on to this....There has to be a new generation of "Niner bandwagoners" out there that are clueless/classless.  I say this because growing up in the 80's and 90's, we were known as a 1st class organization with the best fans.  Fans would never accuse a player of giving away game plans.  

It's the same shit about the stabbings and fights going down in the parking lot these days.  To a certain point, we as fans represent the team.   




 It wasn't a overnight decision, but a gradual one.  It was almost as if each smoke was getting less and less enjoyable to the point where it wasn't feeling as good as it did before.  

That combined with getting a nasty nasty flu which made me quit cold turkey.  So in the end, it was a culmination of the above.  I wasn't one of those people who tried quitting on numerous occassions.  1x and thats it.  Probably because I knew how easy it would be to start again 




 The bun looks off, not in and outish 




 There will always be Alex haters, and games like the one on Sunday will just put him under the microscope more.  I will say this, he has all the necessary resources for him now which means he has to deliver.  If not, you can bet everyone will be calling for Kaep next year.   




 Try it with chocolate milk instead of Baileys next time.  Choc mint schnapps 




 Dallas is pretty shitty BBQ.  Take him to Dinosaur.   




 Our pass rush is nowhere near as lethal as last year.  One of the reasons we can let the secondary be loose was because we pressured the qb so much that he would make hasty decisions.   




 Well..did you or did you not buy the cuff links? 




 Ill grab the popcorn 




 Fuck that!  Any girl that tries to dis your moment with your mom is pretty inconsiderate and rude.  Tell her she needs to respect that shit, or get out.   




 funny how many variations came out after Albertos.  I've seen Albiertos, Jilbertos, Alberos,  




 The hot sauce makes it buffalo?  dont get it 




 Biden: You wanna dance?   




 Would u happen to remember the name do the NYC restaurant? 




 I'm glad you addressed this.  I'm seeing similar stuff happen on r/videos.  Esp the top video being reposted hours later. Sometimes even the next day.   




 Hey bitch, it's fags like you that are ruining Reddit.  People are onto your pathetic attempts.  Congratulations, you've discovered the internet.  Now go back to your mom's basement, piss the fuck off.   




 I was thinking pork shoulder as well, doing carnitas tacos.  Pretty filling, and tasty, plus it puts a theme on the diner.   




 My counterpoint.  Lived in the hood before, have hood friends, have done hood shit.  None of that shit scares me.  What does scare me is folks like you. Reasons why below

You're general stereotype reasoning of "pencil thin mustache, earrings, little thug lingo"  shows me just how fucking unintelligent and ignorant you are.  Which gives me enough reason to understand, that you don't know what it's like to be on other side. You'll never know.  Most of us on here are fortunate enough not to.  But it's views like yours that exist and to know you could be in a higher position than the kid in the video and therefore use your reasoning and judge the kid negatively

In your case, your broad based assumptions, along with your narrow sighted views are what enrage me, and will lead me to call you out on your BS.  The cops have no right treating anyone like that.  The kid should suffer and get harrassed because of another person with the same background committed a crime?  Your god damn right you go no problem with what the cops did, because you'll never fuckin get it.   




 This isn't 20 questions, and clearly you're new to Reddit.  You boldly make points in your post claiming the real victims are those who live in neighborhoods.  I can tell you straight up my friends that live in the hood, have pride. They don't consider themselves anything, nonetheless victims. You're making a assumption.  

This topic is all about the kid, and how he is perceived.  You said he walks and talks like a thug.  What's your basis?  This debate is about how you should explain yourself.  B/C if you truly think this kid is what a thug embodies both external and internal experience, you would be terrified thinking every single male youth in the inner city is a thug.  I disagree with every point you bring, not because of you.  Because there is no validity.  You're trying to sink this argument down to something else.  So, care to explain more?   




 I'm asking you to further explain yourself.  Simple as that.  Can you do that?   




 Whats your basis for what a thug walks and talks like?  boyz n the hood?  Walking around bushwick late at night observing hooligans?  Truly would like to know 




 Thanks!
 




 totto is only chicken based, so if you're looking for tonkotsu, i suggest hiden chan only bc the wait at ippudo is rididuclous 




 how is jin ramen?  out of all the ramen joints in nyc, which one you prefer?  to me it's a toss up b/w hide chan, and totto.   




 It's funny, but every so often YouTube commentators are pretty damn funny. 95% however are teenage trolls. 




 word appreciate it
 




 I don't trust cops.  I also have a hard time trusting people in general.  But I will say, even if my life was in danger, I still wouldn't rely on NYPD.  Been thru and seen enough interactions to know that it's pointless to approach em.   




 Just look at his profile, it's lame repost attempts at almost everything.  Key words:  Redditor for 10 months 




 thanks this one got the best reviews on yelp.   




 It's OK, i was trying to get a cool pic from my wedding, but spaced out as well.  Next yr def 




 Happy cakeday! 




 Thanks!  I'll make sure to add it to the list 




 you rock

 I have to be out in Orlando for work in Nov, and I'm desperately trying to avoid the Disney/Universal area.  Any recs for spots that play good house with good dancers, and not a pretentious crowd?   




 Ah Thats kinda weak, esp since food truck burgers are kinda hard to mess up.  Nothing nastier than walking into a restaurant and looking at a mediocre menu and knowing you have shitty options 




 Hi there, you need to go to a qualified HTC.  Here is a list of places in the Florida area.

 Yessir!  Gotta try grouper ceviche, sounds amazing.  My fav is to rub with vegetable oil, and salt.  400 degree oven for 10-15, grate some daikon and eat with soy sauce.  Kama at its best.   




 What you know about the collarbone?   




 16 is still better than a restaurant, esp you're getting a quality burger  




 There's very few rookies that came into the NFL and make immediate impact.  On a team that's stacked like ours, why risk mistake/injury?  AJ and LMJ will get on the field sometime this season, but don't expect much.   




 No way we do, and I was a Alex hater up till last year.  I've already accepted the fact Alex is not gonna be the proto typical QB we've been accustomed to.  But Kaep is still a year away easy.  Alex has mastered this playbook already, knows the in's and out's.   




 The train ride over to the stadium was majority Niners.  I was actually a little nervous before kickoff that some guido Jets fan would try to start shit, but there was red jerseys everywhere.  In other words, backup.   




 Friend of mine in HS thought it was P.M Dawn "Die without shoes"  Its die without you 




 Sec 338 row 15 




 Yo!  Same here.  I'm rockin the red Montana.  Pre-game beers in the parking lot?   




 I'm so f'n pumped, going to the game this Suday!  Sorry just wanted to share that with ya'll.  Let's go Niners.   




 I also think having Ginn's absence makes a big difference in field position.  Especially those extra 5-10 yards on punts/kickoffs for starting field position 




 I believe this, these toilets are found in japan although not as much as before.  At first I thought it was the weirdest thing, but after I got used to em, it was [easy](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1 hl=en safe=off sa=N biw=1152 bih=773 tbm=isch tbnid=0_mheoUz1XAjwM: imgrefurl=http://thejapanesepage.com/culture/toilets.htm docid=d4-BJcIDo5yWNM imgurl=http://thejapanesepage.com/gif/benjo.jpg w=404 h=384 ei=Qw9jUKWSLsXU0gHxr4C4Dw zoom=1 iact=rc dur=3 sig=101641834725119472669 page=1 tbnh=118 tbnw=128 start=0 ndsp=25 ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:136 tx=58 ty=51) 




 Different tastes for different folks, but you're grilling asian food here.  kinda doubt cheese is gonna jive well with korean bbq 




 It's his office #, public info.  Not a cell 




 Hey folks, was curious who all was planning on attending the meeting.  Possible Reddit/Hemophilia meetup?   




 I think most of us would love to see that happen, but WCO (west coast offense) is a combo of short timing patterns and power runs which ultimately open up the deep ball.  At the end of the day, I just don't think it's in Alex to chuck it up there.  I for one would love to see a jump ball to Randy Moss.   




 If you ever make it out to NYC, first round is on me.  Welcome to the beginning of the rest of your life.  Shoot, your post inspired to me to live better
