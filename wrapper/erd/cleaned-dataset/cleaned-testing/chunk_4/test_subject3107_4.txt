 There's nothing to do but go all out now.  Upload the audio files, dig deeper,  because you're fucked anyway. 




 **Defying Gravity** because when I hit the notes I feel like a princess and when I don't it's still a hell of a lot of fun. 

**Chandelier** channels my inner shower goddess. 

**La Vie en Rose** because it's absolutely gorgeous. 

**I Won't Say I'm in Love** because it's my favourite Disney song. 

**Bang Bang** and **Drunk in Love** because there's so much room to mess around.

Thanks ! 




 No problem dude, stay safe! 




 It might not be smart to keep the file and its contents in your home.  As the investigation progresses they will almost certainly search your property. You're going to have to find a secure place to hide it. 




 I would absolutely love to collab with you, female vocalist btw. I rather sing over tracks with lyrics already written, but I'm also open to collaborating with lyrics. :) 




 I'll see what I can do :) 




 Do you want us to devise lyrics as well? Or do you have some planned?

Female vocalists here btw
 




 I may not sound exactly like Taylor Swift, but you can try me?
