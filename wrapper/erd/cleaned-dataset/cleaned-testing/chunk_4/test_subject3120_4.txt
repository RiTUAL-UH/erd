 was this from /r/nosleep ? 




 fuck stupid posts like this I don't fucking care about reddit or the fucking owners of reddit or who got banned or shadow banned or any of that nonsense.  I've had 3 accounts on reddit get banned over the last 8 years, all for bullshit comments or posts...none of it is real and nothing is important. 




 with fake tits...fake nose, fake eyes, fake ears, fake chin... 




 Do you have evidence of payment?   




 I never really got into the comments or discussion except here on /r/conspiracy and /r/korea my two favorite subreddits.  The reason for that is it's so anonymous.  Nobody knows if you're a shill or a real person.  Now there are tools to check your reddit stream and get a sense of whether you are real or not.  I use that service before commenting.

Mostly I share posts that are interesting to me, my comments lately have been mostly negative.

And I don't give a shit about karma.  Downvote me all you want...karma is useless IRL 




 mintpressnews.com is down 




 ah, no I went back and fixed it 




 what's the app?  nvm, it's called xora. 




 What did the manager say?  There's no follow up video 














 Gorgeous.  The woman on the left looks like my wife about 25 years ago... 




 face like a dog.   




 He was publicly shamed on social media, the MSM picked it up and put him to the fire.  He could have weathered it like other politicians have, but he wanted to put it past him...he really thought he still had a chance to do something.

 Here's an informal survey: 

Of the beta's we registered for in 2014 (over 100), only 2 have come to fruition. 




 It discourages real people too.  Honestly, I would switch over in a heart beat if it was more user friendly.

 the problem with voat is you can't vote until you have at least 100 comment karma 




 Wasn't Karmanaut huge on Digg before its demise? 




 True, but site-wide admins can ban subreddit mods if they don't like them and there's nothing you can do about it.  Happened to me. 




 so where do you think we should go? 




 In w. MA, most of us head up to Puffer's Pond in Amherst, or just about anywhere on the CT river... 














 nice tits, but she's fugly 




 We call his show "InfoLiars.com" 




 you should be able to adjust the machine heads.  Is there some sort of screw on the side there?

Also, that nut looks pretty worn.  My advice is to take it to a luthier 




 oh, like what /b/ does to reddit, tumblr? 




 It's probably the machine heads slipping.  You can take a screwdriver and tighten them.  That should solve the problem 




 You know it's just an ajusshi feeling old and worthless 




 My youngest son and his wife live in Ashland, which is the next town over. 














 What is "brigading"?  Google's coming up short 




 reminds me of a site I used to browse called "zen desk" or something like that 




 Fuck you you prick.  It's douchebags like you that should go down.  You sold a shitbag product and now you come on reddit to threaten you will "escalate"?  Fuck off and die you piece of shit. 




 I used to subscribe to this site, but I realized that a) they were mostly harvesting emails and b) only a small percentage actually become startups, so I unsubscribed 


































 It means I have a very well developed "ear" for sound. Playing the violin requires that you develop near perfect pitch as there are no frets or keys to press. 














 I speak English and have a good ear because of over 50 years playing the violin...but I can't understand this man.   














 Flaying is a lost art

 Chrome should be renamed "spyware for android" 




 op instead of posting these with stupid headlines, why not use the model's name? 




 It's time to stop equating Conservatives with Christards.  I'm Conservative, but a non-believer. 














 I too came to the mandolin from the violin after 18 years of classical training.  The pick did take me many years to learn.  My advice is to practice a variety of picking patterns with scales.  Also the Kreutzer violin etudes are very helpful for learning how to pick. 




 Rogue hands down.  Amazon.com often has it at $45 and free shipping with a prime membership 




 Yeah, unlike a violin which has a bass bar under the G string, most cheap mandolins are made without any additional tone bars, so converting it for left handed use should be no problem. 




 It's worth taking it to a mandolin shop/luthier.  If it is a Vega (Boston) or Gibson, you may have a collector's item worth something 




 Nice how they suggest Gordon ["30% Is Lies"](https://archive.org/details/GordonDuff.FalseInformationControversy) Duff is a reputable reference. 




 she has a pretty face.  I don't want to see her pimply butt

 The red haired girl came on Reddit to explain her part in that video yesterday.  I'll see if I can find the link.  It was on the front page 




 It certainly is, and for a lot of Americans, has been this way for a generation if not more

 You guys who've been reading Zerohedge, waiting for the shit to hit the fan, well this is it...it's slowly happening, dribble by shitty dribble...it will probably take another 10-15 years, but this is the new state of our society.  And it's not going to get any better
