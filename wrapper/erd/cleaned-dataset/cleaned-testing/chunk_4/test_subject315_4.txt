 By all means, lets hang the dude before the facts are heard. Trial by media, amirite? 




 I agree, they are probably wrecked by high heels.  




 She hides he colosotomy and/or adult diaper well inside the fins. What some men forget that some cute paraplegic girls are totally incontinent,  so it stinks extra nice when you are going in for a piece of that sweet wheelchair meat. 




 Man, she's getting old, you can see it in her feet 




 That is a foot of a fat person 




 Whatever will I do, he has contributed so much to gaming, will I ever be able to game again? Loljk 














 Yes, perhaps this is a vain attempt. Maybe we could appeal to them to use  this as a forum for their own "confession." I would expect the use of throwaway accounts. One can only hope. 









 Its funny how women feel attractive in high heels yet they utterly destroy the feet. As a man I find it very unattractive when a woman is constantly in heels.  




 I hate Donnie's "DreamWorks" face.  




 Scar: Ahh, my friends.

Shenzi: Friends? I thought he said we were the enemy.

Banzai: That's what I heard. Ed?

Ed the Hyena: Oo-oo-ooh, he-he, he-he-he... 




 Thanks.  




 She has gross monkey feet 




 Nobody is reading the data huh? Care to back that up with something other than smoke blown up my ass? 




 Garden State 2.0 



meh 




 Grown non-retarded cats don't meow to each other, just humans. Its not their language. 




 Your friend is running away from something....probably not just his parents.  




 Ok kid, lets see you play it the way I played it on a Compaq 386 inside DOS on a green-tinting CRT monitor and not hate it  holy shit im a video game grandpa now....I just realized. 




 You would hate the original  




 My girlfriend has this same problem and wonders why she can't make friends. I've never been able to establish a concrete reason why people don't like her, she is a very nice and attractive person. I also have the same problem with making friends. So...our solution is just fucking our brains out and giving the middle finger to the world. Fuck it all and have sex. Forced friends will invariably let you down in some way, and in a way you almost set yourself up for failure, I think, by scrutinizing things too closely. Another suggestion from me would be to put yourself in a place you would not normally be, get out of your comfort zone. Good luck!   




 Yay another app that reads my texts. And thats actually part of the appeal? Fuck this app. 




 It's as shame her feet are wrecked by high -heels. 




 Way to give out your checking account info to random strangers, dumbass. This guy deserves to have his identity stolen. 




 I do not reserve sympathy for people who get their shit blown away in modern American wars. You volunteered, you knew the risks, and now this poor beautiful girl has to wait after this guy for as long as they stay married (probably wont last more than 5-10 years) while she wastes away her potential and he sucks off the permanent welfare teat.  




 Dat bruised toe....blech 




 I feel like I'm reading some 30-something's psych evaluation, the artist's way of coping with the fact that he/she might be getting a bit too old for Pokemon. 









 For fucks sake,  can we just start a /r/underappreciatedcashiers subreddit that you minimum-wage workers can bitch in? This is not an advice mallard this is a disgruntled barcode scanner venting about his or her shifty life. 




 Oh shit, are we doing this now? 




 Porn 









 When you stick your hand in her underpants it feels like you're feeding a horse. 




 Yeah.....uh.... about that.... 




 I can't help but feel that there is so much backlash due to this because he choked a white guy 




 Bonus: her thumbs are also toes 




 She's got the lesbian 




 Sounds like the teacher just prefers anyone but your friend. 




 This point is moot and there is no more monopoly: there are like 3 different names of albuterol I can just think of from the top of my head (ventolin, proventil, and generic albuterol)

 Heh heh 




 Uhhhh......yeah....about that..... 




 Well said 




 we have joint legal custody 




 i was pointing out the hypocrisy here 




 Can we all agree that the term "real man" means jack shit? 




 true 




 we fucked when we were horny teens, then forced into marriage when the pregnancy happened. By forced I mean what the hell else do we know when we are 19? 




 read up 




 horny teenagers dont know what crazy is, because they are crazy 




 Nah, my ex just love to pose "hypotheticals" to me to start arguments.  




 fuck 




 So I mentioned the HPV vaccine to her, strangely, she is on board with that but tries to fight me on the flu shot (i work in a hospital,  my kids definitely get the shot). I think she gets most of her info from "blog mom" websites 




 This is partially true. My ex is so fundie now she won't have sex with another person until she is married again. She brags about this to me, when I mention that she seems lonely because she just loves to waste time texting and calling me, she tells me that all men are losers not worthy of her blah blah blah, in the meantime my kids get to witness what a wonderful example she is. 




 Yeah to too late for that.  But honestly I had no idea she was capable of these levels of fundie when we were married 




 Lol. It's a subreddit... not an admission of anything! If you judge people on their post history on reddit, I can't imagine how you deal with people IRL. Sorry you feel this way!  




 I like feet, big deal. Also: get a life!  




 They have girl programs 




 JOint legal 




 Fuck this 




 Me and my ex can't move more than 100 miles of each other per the divorce decree.  




 I was 19 and stupid,  I even "joined" her church 




 Read up 




 Thank you.  




 Read up 




 Hey we have joint legal custody. Grow some balls.... That's fucking sexist 




 Can't deal with crazy 




 She is 30 now 




 Yeah it takes 1 :/ 




 Well my daughter is only 9, but these are the things my ex-wife brings up in normal "conversation." AKA steamrolling  









 I really needed this. "Kids understand awesome." I've never thought it about it this way. These three simple words are about to bring this grown man to tears. 




 We got pregnant as teenagers. Her family pushed for marriage, I was too scared to do anything else.  




 Its also called "Royal Rangers" not bible scouts. I called it that to explain what it is.  









 Obligatory fondant tastes gross post. 




 Fucking gross 




 This may be true,  but statistically the non-handicap stall closest to the restroom entrance is cleaner. 




 Does it bother you that you are way way way way way way way way way less successful than Will Smith? 




 Did he turn his pussy into a peepee? 




 "Happy Birthday" 




 "Maths teacher punishes students that don't read books." 




 Yeah this isn't racism, just lack of exposure to the facts.  




 It is stupid for assume she is a bigot, yes. Ignorant of facts and naive is more like it. 




 Oh yeah? I didn't get that. I wish there was a drug I could take to be as smart as you.  




 Drugs are normal. What world do you live in? 




 You are clearly the smart one here 




 Zipper chest or it didnt happen 




 Big, sucessful company has some money in the bank. Is this really news? 




 Mommy, why does Batman have titties? 









 10 people is pretty good. Here is some simple advice...when you do go out to get groceries or what have you, compliment one random person a day. Sometimes you gotta fake love for a little bit and you will start loving yourself more.  




 Maybe you shouldn't have put so much pressure on him and been there when he needed it...asian father!! 




 There is a reddit with amnesia that forgets this is posted every six months in some form.  














 I have a crush on you,  Carrie. I'm saddened there are no good photos of your feet online. Can you please send me a photo of your feet? Thank you. Fred, you rock! 




 It's an imperfect system. It's the media that does the initial damage... do we really need to see their mug shots until they are sentenced?  




 They are not murderers until convicted. I know you really want everything summed up in a song and dance and then change the channel, but we can't do that in an ordered society.  




 We also don't need people jumping to conclusions before all the facts are heard.  




 She is not subjectively fat. Her BMI I'm sure is in the "obese" range. You are too emotional.  




 I mean fat...do you mean fat? 




 You can tell she was already ruining her feet even at this young age with high heels and small shoes. That big toe angle... dead giveaway and kind of a turn off. 




 Holy heck she got...uh....you know. 




 She is good-looking now,  but I can't help but get this sinking feeling she is not going to age well.  









 If only they were paper we would have 500 wishes.  




 Gross feet 





























 You sir, are a racist.  




 So is it a hard "no" then? Is everything so black-and-white? If they are how I propose, wouldn't it be in their best interest to keep up appearances? 




 The fact that your thoughts come from 10-second searches which are invariably biased has eliminated my desire to have further discussion with you.  




 Does it not deserve some thought? 




 If they are a cult then perhaps we are not fully aware of their inner workings. Does anybody get what I'm saying here? Maybe they have taken it upon themselves to be hated so everyone else can love each other. Just another thought.  




 Personally I feel they are a pro-lgbt and pro-human rights group in "disguise." They announce ahead of time where they are going to protest. Almost every time they are mentioned in the news it is also mentioned that the community came together to form a human wall or something to stop them. And they just stand out there smiling holding their signs, then pack up and leave without hurting anybody. I feel their message is in fact not "God Hates Fags" or anything along that line. I think their message is more about the community coming together in harmony and they have found a way to do it consistently. Just a thought.  














 Yes that's my second favorite. Its almost like a sequel to AtD even though it was written first.  



















 That's not a breathing tube, that's a nasal cannula.
