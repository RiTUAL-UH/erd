 Go look up "honorific." 




 Winds tend to take buildings apart from the top down. 




 Only a few degrees allow one to practice medicine, meaning they can diagnose diseases and prescribe medication. M.D., D.O., dentists, podiatrists, and I think optometrists all qualify. A Ph.D. bestows the honorific "doctor," but you can't do medical things. Psychotherapy isn't medical practice, and many therapists have Ph.D.s. But most Ph.D.s don't care to be called "doctor" except in certain professional settings where the credential is socially valuable. 




 Your mom. 




 Orthography and etymology do matter in making distinctions; words that took different paths to the same pronunciation are not automatically the "same word," and definitely not if their spelling differs, as in this case. There's an argument that rake/rake are different words because of their histories as well as meanings, with ho/hoe the difference is much clearer. 




 No opinion on the stuff you've dug up 'cause I know nothing about architecture, but I was at UT for two years before someone pointed out that PCL is also (on purpose) roughly the shape of Texas. 




 Not a snob, but I like the beans at Wheatsville.  




 I read *Prisoner of Trebekistan* by Bob Harris, a 5-day winner, along with a lot of his blogging, and he's just fascinated with everything under the sun in a childlike, omigosh-look-at-this way that's both endearing and inspiring. Ken Jennings seems the same way to me. 




 Different spellings = no credit. IMHO anyway. 




 Reminds me of a too-high-atop-the-pizza-parlor story. This is secondhand, but I have no reason to doubt it. When I was an assistant manager at a Pizza Hut, back when they all had those peaked red roofs, the story went around of a manager of one of the busiest PHs in the city who had decided that the attic space under the roof was the perfect place to go smoke weed after he got off work. It was summer, so it was pretty hot up there, and he stripped to his underwear. 

Now, there's a reason they always told us never to store things in the attic space: The "floor" isn't designed to hold weight. The manager was walking around up there, when he suddenly crashed through the floor *into the dining area* which was full of people eating. He got up, ran out the door (still in his underwear), and was never heard from again. 




 Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:

* don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result.
* don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.) 
* only shave once; it's all that's needed.

It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.

Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure. 




 Shampoo and soap. I stopped using both above the neck a few years ago, and my skin and hair are both in great shape. I do shower every day, including rinsing my hair.

I'm way past my teen years, so I can't speak for the effects on acne. But I wish I'd known to try this back then. 

NOTE: You have to give it at least a week before things will normalize; for a few days your face and scalp will feel oily. It'll get better. 




 That may be, I only saw the thread last week; that person may have been referring to HM. Thanks for the info. 




 I live alone, and there's no way I would fall for this. Not after last year. I know what to expect now. 




 Mashup of "Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Because you look like an angel" and "Are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only ten I see." Reference to a "ridiculous pickup lines" thread here last week. 




 That actually sounds tempting.

 The trip to the championships is a big deal for all families, so they pull out the stops for the trip. The flashy cars are probably the most visible thing the visitors are doing besides going to the track meet itself, so that's what most people notice.

 Absolutely. 

A friend of mine once was job-hunting (she works in tech) and suggested to prospective employers that she work 4x10 instead of 5x8, if the job allowed it, and from their reactions she concluded that they were unofficially expecting her to work 5x10. 




 This is why it's better to tell the truth; it's hard to keep the lies straight.

Toby: Really?

Sam: Yes.

Toby: You accidentally slept with a prostitute.

Sam: Call girl.

Toby: Accidentally.

Sam: Yes.

Toby: I don't understand. Did you trip over something?  




 My best friend is an ex-GF. So is my second-best friend, come to think of it. No residual romance in either case, but we care about each other and are in touch pretty much every day.

I have some opposite-sex friends I find attractive who are not romantically available because of distance or being married or whatnot, but the attraction just adds a little glow to our interactions. I don't feel as if I'm missing out, because I like just having these people in my life. 




 I was going to try to think of a good one, but I can't top this. 




 Respectfully but unambiguously.

You may want to ask the other person to work with you on making the relationship healthy again. If they won't do that, or if it's already been tried without success or is otherwise not an option, then do what you need to do.

 The idea implicit in the question "Why is there something instead of nothing?" that there *could* "be" "nothing." That if you took away everything that exists, including the interstellar space and so on, that there wouldn't even be an empty anything there, because there wouldn't be a "there" at all. 

Related: The instant before the Big Bang, when the universe hasn't started expanding yet ... it's not expanding *into* anything, it's spreading the *fact* of existence. 




 And then there's the things that aren't letters *or* numbers ... I was once in a study group and one student whose field is game theory was working out equations on a whiteboard, and most of it just looked like squiggles (and I've had a year of calculus). 




 The logic is that instead of paying taxes overseas they'll pay taxes here. They may actually end up paying less in total, but it won't go to the Bahamas or wherever they have their shelter set up.

 Getting back to you: This helped. I got together with a Python whiz, and we used a good portion of the code in that script. Thanks again! 




 A friend of mine was stuck in a closet for hours once; IIRC the closet doors were the louvered folding kind, and she let them close behind her, but they were flush with the bottom and top of the doorway, so she couldn't get a grip on them to open them again (they folded into the closet IIRC). She had to wait till her SO got home from work and wandered within earshot.

 That may be the "right" thing to do, but we should harbor no illusions that anyone at the church will be swayed. [WBC is a Primitive Baptist Calvinist church](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-kraus/westboro-baptist-church-rebecca-barrett-fox_b_4997296.html); its doctrine teaches that all people outside the church, and possibly some within it, are damned to eternal hellfire. Messages of kindness and love will sound to them like Charlie Brown's teacher -- Wa-wa-WA wa-wa wa-wa-WA.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take the high road; I'm saying that if we do, it's for our benefit and the benefit of others outside WBC. We just shouldn't fool ourselves about having an effect on the Phelpses themselves.
