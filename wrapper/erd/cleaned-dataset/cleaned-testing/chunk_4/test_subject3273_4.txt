 It is indeed a very beautiful town, and Tennessee's oldest town! Here's a picture my dad took from downtown Jonesborough.

 Can I take a message? 




 Tis a very similar landscape.

 Na we have "hollers" here in TN. I've live here for about 10 years and haven't really figured out if there is a defined landscape that makes a holler a holler or if the places they call holler are just called that because the road names are named such. For example "hog hollow rd" is a road name in this county and that area is generally referred to as hog holler.  




 Yep sure is is! 




 Oh Em Gee. 




 I've been up to Mountain City a few times and the path from Johnson City to Mountain City that goes up by Watauga Lake is absolutely gorgeous. I've always wanted to go out on that lake.  




 That's awesome! I love living near mountains. I'm not sure if I'd want to live anywhere else. Just about everyday I see something that I haven't noticed before. I hate when they go bare as well. Way more beautiful in the summertime when everything is green. 




 This is what I see.
