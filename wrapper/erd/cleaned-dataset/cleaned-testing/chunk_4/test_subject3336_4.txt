 can you provide some info on the black bars in Frames?  
I dont know if its common to everybody but, hitting next on Every photo in an album on facebook always results in disk activity and also scrolling down the news feed for stories in the past also leads to disk activity. 




 Yes, because they develop it and test it out for maximum performance with chrome. 




 Yes, chrome does play html5 YouTube much better and smoother, because they implemented it first and launched it. Now everybody else is playing catch-up. Sick marketing move.  




 i still feel Flash is horrible on chrome. It does play better than Firefox on Linux but it takes a couple or more of "refresh" page to get the video to load in the first place.  
im hoping that these sites convert once html5 video gets a little more traction.  
And yes the awful works-on-Chrome mentality is more than bearable these days _ 




 Yeah true but kinda feels bad that people still mention it as if he was forced to resign and they are using that as a reason to abandon :(  
Hope they get some sense into their heads soon and firefox goes far ahead from the current catch-up situation.
 




 most news channels/popular sites still use some form of flash player :/  
i wish they convert 




 eh? Java works fine on all my OS's. Whats your issue? 




 Strange, people are still talking of the Brenden Eich issue. :/  
Mozilla needs to address this again.  




 emojione is trying to address these issues.  
they could probably make a font with the work they have done but that hasnt happened yet.  
they welcome devs to use all the content that is open-sourced  - http://emojione.com/  




 so far gimp in comparison to PS.  
Other than that krita, mypaint, inkscape, synfig  




 Apple emojis are proprietary.  
The only open sourced emoji I've known so far is Google's, and emojione.com  
Emoji One is a better answer than both of them,  but is Web based.  
Edit -  Firefox does support emoji, you might be missing the font files on your system. Get the symbola font from unicode or segoe ui if your on windows 8 




 This isn't an animation software :/  
SynFig could help you 




 okay even more recent(as far as possible) xD - https://twitter.com/OrmrTheEditor 




 they are active here though - https://www.facebook.com/OrmrTheEditor  

Linux beta is out as of - 3 December 2014 - http://www.getormr.com/download 














 if its real bad, i think you have to reset your browser or create a new profile. back up before proceeding.

 Get rid of ad block for a while and check if you find a difference. 
Also try safe mode.  




 Broke my heart :'( , Linux is secondary everywhere  




 its so beautiful  




 You'll have to wait on the white page, I get it too, the site loads fine after the small wait.  
If it doesn't I think it's because of connection trouble  









 Few things come with a user manual these days. Many people struggle using a smart phone. Too much clutter and confusion. 









 Ah true, people are influenced by what they see around them, but devs could have a final say on the matter  




 The right click isn't an issue, it the way it should work.   
If you've high end cad programs like catia or so, it's right click everywhere  




  The problem is with the open source community is that they too content with what they have, they don't see lack of good GUI tools on Linux a problem because they use the command line anyway

Dont feel that way, we wanted Office, we've got LibreOffice and OpenOffice.  We wanted a alternative to 3ds max/Maya(though maya runs on Linux) we got blender and its going places. Alternative to Autodesk Sketchbook, we've got Krita and MyPaint. Corel Draw/Illustrator - Inkscape, SynFig.  
There is an abundance of good software, i'll admit some of these having a learning curve but they are worth the time spent!   
The community has never kept quiet, we've kept demanding, its just the commercial bigshots are ignorant, and the community had to figure out its own version of things.
 




 im downloading the new dev built right now :D 




 hehe wish it was as simple :D 




 wow you've done a whole load of work. :O :O :O  
Maybe you could ask people here or at /r/linux or similar sub reddits for help? Collab with people on git hub if you like? 




 and it will positively impact the Linux culture and base if its picked up and worked upon.  Many people just wish Photoshop runs on Linux so that they could convert. That hasn't happened so far. :/  
The open source community is good, just that sometimes, things are out of focus or pressing issues are not addressed 




 oh okay! Awesome :) 




  Contests for UI and UX do not work (that is what "everyone feels qualified to criticize the UI and suggest improvements" would be). 

i think if mock-ups are shown to the public or demo-ed, then people can vote on the best implementation.  
Also people who have a better concept should be given consideration and voted along with the other concepts.  
GIMP has quite a long release cycle, so this should be possible.

 




 yup!  
I just wish changing opacity, brush size, colors, could be done on the go. Krita does an almost amazing job at this. A artist who's drawing something doesn't have to constantly switch between the keyboard and tablet/mouse much. 




 true, but i feel blender provides more co-ordination while using that rule, and you don't have to remember most of the commands or dig the menu's, the space bar/search gives everything!   




 and the new engine :D! 




 just to clarify, i meant a wacom drawing tablet :) 




 Ah yes I agree about the issues with preview  




  vector  
I guess it's a typo 

GIMP ui currently is way better than what Blender was in the initial days. But blender has picked up, polished it self and has a much better UI today but the most important thing is that it's still Blender.  
There is a learning curve to both these software's, but something about UI/UX is important to have a really smooth work flow.  
Love blenders rule - one hand on keyboard and one on mouse  









 No love for Russia? 




 if you have a tablet, you can sketch using the pencil tool.  
Afterwards use the node tools, simply the path(Ctrl+L), and keep tweaking and adjusting!   




  We'll help you to flesh out your idea and promote it to a larger community. 

Okay that felt awesome to read! :D  
I think with some proper co-ordination this could be possible and hopefully big! 




 MSE is quite usable on the Nightlies for sometime now. Some bugs are left and some new ones pop up too, so unless every known issue is dealt with its better to keep them in testing.  
Would also be a negative backlash when you ship something thats only partially working 




 xD well something can be done to make it non-capitalistic  




 Yes but the scale has been low I feel :/ 




 I believe contributors will show up, because most people don't want to shell out huge $ on a legal version of Photoshop. If there's an alternative that works just as good, then it's well worth contributing something for such a cause.  
The UI could use a fix, many other features can be smoothened out, yes Photoshop and Gimp are different, that should remain, but there are things like cmyk etc. that still haven't happened. A drive like this should enable users to vote on a set features they want to see implemented in time frame.  




 oh yeah :/ missed that.  
But still the possibility of such an event would be wild and awesome  




 Yup true! But i guess the team could also use the money to hire part time/full time programers for the project  




 I've outline a few steps normal user's can take up to ensure that their privacy is protected with the different softwares one uses on a computer or smartphone.  
Here the link [Short Guide on Privacy/Safety tech for your Browser, Smartphones and OS](https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/short-guide-on-privacysafety-tech-for-your-browser-and-os/)  
Do read and please leave your feedback here or on the page :)  
Hope it helps! 




 Yes very true! Many people I've known would want to use gimp, but they aren't very comfortable once they start using. If a campaign to fund and improve gimp happens then I guess lots of contributions will pour in.  
Especially the fact being it's open source and free!  




 We all know that there is no Photoshop on Linux and I dont think Adobe has any plans to make one.    
GIMP is the best thing available but IMHO it hasn't reached that level of perfection we would like. Yes, it does a lot of things Adobe can do and sometime even better but theres a feel that something's missing.    
Krita another OSS app went for a successful Kickstarter funding recently(https://krita.org/item/krita-2-9-0-the-kickstarter-release/) and its helped the software and the community pretty well.  
Im sure lots of users out there would like GIMP to reach the top, many want a true Photoshop alternative thats simple to use and looks good.  
What are your thought /r/gimp ?  Wouldn't such a funding campaign help GIMP progress as the app we want? 




  Am I just pulling stuff out my ass or do you guys notice a correlation  

ah well its true, but i dont think because its because they are branded as OSS. Its mostly the look of the app, and the ease of usability that matters to an end user.     




 Yes! i wish GIMP also goes with some move like this!  
We could possibly have a perfect alternative to Photoshop!

 Please do post this in /r/firefox 




 can confirm on Fedora 21 on some sites even after having freetype subpixel rendering and anti-aliasing enabled.  
Chrome renders extremely thin fonts, still looking for an answer.  
One solution is to use your own custom fonts by changing the browser settings. 




 ive done it all, even gstreamer(both versions) is installed, and the test case at http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/tests/video.html plays the MP4/H264 but YouTube wont show green :( 




 there is opensouce http://emojione.com/  
Its meant for the Web, but it could to be implemented in distro's with some mods  
Nobody has shown interest in color emojis on Linux so far  




 amd actually is more better with their driver support and openness, but yes a pain to find and install.  
Its similar with nvidia when u have new things like Optimus tech and all happening.  
Some looking around(RPM Fusion) should help you, orelse get the drivers from the AMD website itself. Its the best possible source. 




 its because your middle mouse click has been activated, by some key combo mostly.  
Autoscroll allows you for 4 way scrolling. 




 oh yea, ive noticed in the YouTube html5 page MSE   H264 still appears disabled :(  
wishing things work out! 




   the puzzle.
 
 Mozilla is starting with Facebook video as they're rolling out Shumway, so if Facebook suddenly eliminated their use of Flash it would be...

oh awesome! :D  
Hoping Shumway rolls out to linux soon :D   




 Try booting into safe mode!  
It disables rest of the apps, if thats causing some interference and also try wiping "cache" in recovery    




 /u/Alhaitham_I corrected me, its an instagram embed facebook. 




 ah yes true, i didnt see/might've missed the instagram overlay.  
Thanks for correcting me! :) 




 im on Nightly 38.0a1 (2015-02-22) and its so far appeared for that video in the screenshot, guess it was some kind of momentary test run 




 :) Check your omtc status in 'about: support'  




 Bad UI, pricing, minimum marketing and no guaranteed updates across the entire android range.  




 Ah I meant for Linux  
I guess in Windows it's already enabled by default, if not you just need to enable the omtc option and not the one I've mentioned here.  
I'm not sure of the technicalities of the property I mentioned to be enabled but without it omtc on Linux remains disabled.  




 also this - layers.acceleration.force-enabled 




 ah yes true that method will work.  
I was served this version without spoofing the user agent on linux. 




 On mobile yes, but not on desktop i think.  
Never saw the html player on Facebook before 




 i think it hasn't been implemented properly, i was lucky to get this in html mp4, others have been using flash X_X 









  Ah, so there's several patents covering Cleartype, I didn't know that.

yeah! its also the same case H264 and many audio/video formats 




 oh you should have mentioned Debian  
"Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault" is what you need i feel. Check out this link for more info:  
http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1ofgl7/howto_better_looking_fonts/

EDIT - about the Liberation Sans, i think its wise to file a bug report to debian to make them aware of the issue on the choppiness of the font, so that they can rectify it! 




 Lcdfilter will enable sub-pixel rendering. Great font rendering on lcd screens.  




 From Wiki:  
"Microsoft has several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. This had caused FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, to disable this functionality by default.[4]

Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.[12]

The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between 1998-10-07 and 1999-10-07, thus should expire in 2019-10-07" 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/  
http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html  
Any of these 2 methods will drastically improve font rendering, Infinality will also mimic other OS's font rendering mechanism.  
And your browser is also responsible, for some unknown reason Chrome is sub-par at font rendering, do try out Firefox, its simply good these days.  
Also the Liberation Sans font is choppy(if on fedora[maybe other Linux's too] - reported bug but no action has been made yet)

EDIT - There are patents preventing these from enabled by default which is why its left to the users choice 




 Restart and power off phone would be nice  




 This does seem as the issue "Liberation Sans"  
I have it installed on my system (fedora 21) but even in LibreOffice the font is not properly anti-aliased/hinted. Something wrong i guess with the font, will try find a fix for that!  
Thank You for narrowing this problem down :) 




 I have my font rendering correctly setup on Linux,  
It's strange because every other site renders fine except this 




 I do have anti aliasing enabled to rgb, sub-pixel rendering on, and freetype installed. 

It's only this site that has messed up font rendering, everything else is amazing  









 If your graphics card is nvidia Optimus  hybrid technology, then Google for the bumblebee project and install on your os 




 Why so serious?  
   
Docking!  




 In Address bar - "about:config" - Search for "mediasource" and double click to set the options "True"

 You should be on nightly for the webM , the other ignore_codecs is added by the user 




 ah yes that's my last resort :) 




 im thinking of fallback mode.  
EDIT - i just read on some page that pc's made withing the last 3-5 years could work fine.  
On my current machine(i3 4gb ram) - its below 120 MB 




 Thank you for the info! :D  
Just what i wanted to know :D  
Its my first time with debain and just didn't want a bad experience. Thank you Again :) :D 




 ah yes, i did try those links out before coming here, but i couldn't find what i was looking for, luckily the r/debian community has helped me out.  
Thank you for additional info too :D 




 yeah ive been thinking about it too, im just hoping gnome can be used fine with a 512mb ram environment. It used to run the old version of Fedora pretty well and its been a long time(4+ years) since i upgraded it.  
New fedora has a huge minimum req. and ive been wanting to get debian for a long while.  
just hoping it works out fine :)  




 thanks for the live image Readme - help me clear up a bit of the confusion :) 




 what bout these live cd's/usb version(1GB or so i think)?  
the thing thats confusing me is the standard edition and gnome edition. Does the standard have no Desktop Envirnoment? 




 Thank you for the link and answer, but what if I'm without internet? 




 Hello r/debian  
im almost on the verge to get debian for my old system as i found out it will run on hardware(512MB Core Duo) a few years back.  
But as i went to download the live installation media, i found out 2 version's - gnome and standard?  
Whats the difference between those two?  
I'm looking for a gnome desktop as natural because ive been used to it with Fedora a long time.   
Does the standard ship with the gnome desktop or do i have to get the gnome iso as such.   
Also is the installation text based or GUI?   

EDIT - SOLVED - i got the info i wanted to know! Thank you kind people of /r/debian ! :D  
If you do have more info to share, please do! :)

 Yes moto g or moto x any day!  




 I feel so sad for him. 
Stay strong. 
May your dog Rest In Peace  




 glad it helped, its hard to live without the app though, i just wish they made it better to use the RAM efficiently  




 Google has made an amazing blunder of the update mechanism. 
Why don't they approach the update system just like other Linux systems
