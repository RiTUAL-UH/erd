 The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical. 

As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:

* Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it. 
* Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one. 

You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.   




 Cash can be used anywhere that currency can purchase goods.  




 What case is that? 




 Thanks!

Ok so this joke is really really really offensive, but here it is:

What did the Boston Bombers do that Hitler couldn't? 

End a race.

I'm sorry.

 I think THIS is the way to do it, not a 2 minute rejoin window. League of Legends does it this way and it works pretty well in my opinion.  




 What do you mean the map wasn't in the book? 




 How do these compare to the Invisible Shields? I got two anyways but I'd like to know.

 Thanks! 




 678 DayZ please! 




 Try completely uninstalling Synapse and seeing if the keyboard functions as usual. If it doesn't, I think it would be time to send an email to Razer Support.

 Can you really play BF4 on the Edge? What graphics settings and what FPS do you get? 




 To get more rows of tiles on the start screen, go to settings  tiles  show more tiles and tick to yes. On my RT I get four rows instead of three.  




 I'd love a few to repair my old beat-up controllers :)

 And this is news because....? 




 EDIT: Holy shit, Gold! Thank you so much kind stranger! I figured that comment would get buried for sure! 




 I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.  




 It wouldn't be too much more expensive, and it would allow you to add more things in the future if you would like.  




 Better graphics card comes to mind first, then a power supply with more wattage. That's really about it. 

Keep in mind this is a MICRO build, more for portability than anything. If space isn't an issue, get a larger case and a better mobo.  




 You could go with an R9 280X for $100 more and have a PC that will last you for a long time.  




 I built a killer mid-range gaming pc (plays most games like BF4 maxed) for $800 or so just a few months ago so you should be fine with the cash you have set aside. I've posted pcpartpicker below. 

I got a lot of my parts with good deals which is why the total price is a little high.

 Thanks! 




 I mean sure, why not? It's just putting a custom case on a shelf above your desk.   




 Way to ruin it with the title.  




 Ah man, that sucks. Didn't know that was specific to the first generations.  




 Works for me on my RT + Touch Cover 1. You have to tap pretty fast and hold down the second tap.  




 Double-tap then drag. 




 I looked into it more and found that I do have DDR3 memory running at 1333 MHz. It seems that I was looking at the DRAM frequency.  




 I see, it seems I don't know enough about memory. Thank you for the clarification! 




 How much would you be willing to sell two of your 4GB PC3-10600s? 




 I would like to get at least 2 x 4 GB PC3 10600 or PC3 12800 (1333 or 1600 MHz) ram kits at around $30 or so. Anyone have old laptop memory meeting these requirements? Shoot me an offer!
 




 I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:

* Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in. 

* Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill. 

* Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter. 

Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed. 

To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.  




 I have a stock cooler from an FX 6300 never installed. Name your price.  




 I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me. 

I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.  




 Honestly this ultrabook would have pretty much the exact same portability of a surface.  




 Yes, but there are adapters that you can buy to get an ethernet port. 
 




 I upgraded from the Blackwidow Ultimate 2012 edition to the 2013 edition and that was very much worth it. If you have nothing else I say go for it! 




 Just take a look around, they don't really have THAT many products. Only then will you know if there's some really cool looking headset or mouse that other people don't recommend. 

Having said that, though, I recommend:

* Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)

* Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)

* Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset. 

Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.  




 Date and time skin at the center is [Metro Desk X](http://exsess.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Desk-X-v0-8-ALPHA-366743811). Top bar and side bar are custom skins created myself.  









 Try unplugging the keyboard, restarting your computer, and plugging your keyboard back in after your computer has completely booted up again.  




 I don't really see the difference between the two questions? Sure, the second one is more specific but a good reviewer will talk about how the workload impacts social life when asked just the first question (because it's the greatest factor in how social you are). Same for most questions on the page, they sound like generic questions any freshman or college review websites would ask. 




 For comparison here is the same model sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/171011545519?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT _trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649). This is a FANTASTIC monitor well worth the money. Good luck on the sale!
