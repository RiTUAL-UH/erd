 Syria, Iran, and Hezballah have threatened to attack Israel if the US strikes Syria.

Because of this, Israel tested its anti-missile defense system. How does one test an anti-missile defense system? With dummy missiles.

I don't see how it's warmongering to test one's defenses after being threatened with missile strikes, and if Syria wants to test its own missile defenses, it can go right ahead. 









 Ah, so at least it was an emergency. Still not exactly the best seamanship out there, but it wasn't as though the officer was speeding to meet someone for lunch. 




 I'm no boating person, but that sure looks like negligence to me. Anyone know what the police were responding to? 




 I've never found the problem with Dupont Circle to be the cars, it's the pedestrians who jaywalk without looking for said cars. I don't know why Dupont is the one place where 95% of the time, people are stepping in front of cars that have a green light. 




 If the anniversary of the March on Washington threatens to overload our transportation infrastructure to the point where OPM has highly urged federal employees to telework tomorrow, I can't imagine how our region can possibly effectively host the Olympics. 




 What applies to US lawyers might not apply to Canadian lawyers, so, I caution people not to make unwarranted assumptions, and I caution the OP to take all the advice given with a bigger than usual grain of salt.

 I think it's more a matter of they're not shutting down the Red Line right now. But, it seems a matter of time before they'll have to address this problem, and it doesn't seem like something that can be done without shutting down the stations.

 I disagree with those saying to not read/study/learn anything before 1L. I'm not saying you need to (or should) pay money for a system or software (I've never heard of LearnLeo), but if you have the time before school starts, pick up one supplement for each of the core law school classes. 

For Civ Pro, the Glannon Examples and Explanations book is king. For contracts, I liked the Understanding Contracts book from Lexis, but there's no one must-have book like Civ Pro. Do the same for Torts, Con Law, and Property. I wouldn't worry so much about Crim Law because I found Crim Law to vary the most from professor to professor. If you have the time, sure, pick up a book and do the same, but it's at the bottom of the priority listing.

Skim them. No need to brief anything, no need to memorize anything, and no need to master anything. What you should get out of this is a mental catalogue of where elements of the subject fit, so when you read a case, you have a sense of where it fits into the overarching jurisprudential firmament. 




 No, no it does not. The true owner cannot be dispossessed of a right to his/her property, no matter how many times something has changed hands after the theft and no matter whether the people involved knew it was stolen or not. The bona fide purchaser doctrine does not apply to stolen goods.

Leaving real estate out of it, property follows the Irving Principle. There was a 1965 comedy album called "You Don't Have to Be Jewish" that contained a popular song, "The Ballad of Irving," sung by Frank Gallop. The Ballad of Irving was about the 142nd fastest gunslinger in the West. One of the verses began, "141 could draw faster than he, but Irving was looking for 143." That is the Irving Principle. It doesn't matter if 141 can draw faster than you if you're facing 143. Well, in property, it does not matter of 141 people have a better claim to a piece of property than you do, so long as you are up against #143. 

Here's a practical example of the Irving Principle at work. Albert buys a bike. Bob steals the bike and sells it to Cathy, who doesn't know it was stolen. Cathy later sells it to Dwight. Edgar steals the bike from Dwight and sells it to Frank. Who can legitimately claim the bike? It depends on who is making the claim. Dwight can come along get the bike back from Frank because it was stolen from him. Frank has no right to the bike, he has no right to compensation from Dwight for the bike, Frank's only remedy is to try getting his money back from Edgar. This is true, even thought at any point in time, Albert can stumble upon the location of his bike and file suit to get his bike back. Dwight has a better claim than Frank, Albert has a better claim than anyone, but in a fight between Dwight and Frank, Dwight wins. The Irving Principle.

All of which is a roundabout way of saying that bona fide purchasing has nothing to do with stolen property. 




 Of course The Chubby Checker app is a vulgar pun. Of course it violates the trademark of the singer Chubby Checker.

The only element of this story that is potentially newsworthy is that HP might be held liable for trademark infringement over hosting an app that they didn't actually name or create themselves. 




 I'd add Yamas in Bethesda to the list, certainly. 




 I'm a fan of the Lawyer2Lawyer podcast. Some really interesting interviews, and their guests give their contact info at the end if you want to followup on a topic. :-) http://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/lawyer-2-lawyer/ 




 There are dessert trucks, including a pie truck, but their location depends on the day. Sometimes at L'Enfant Plaza, I can get a slice of pie, a cupcake, or a cookie, and some days, there's not a single dessert truck there.

If you'll be doing this during the lunch hour, L'Enfant Plaza is the best place to get government workers. 




 If you're under 25 and might need to rent cars, ABA membership may get you out of paying a surcharge. Otherwise, the $60 is not worthwhile. 




 Depending on the state, there may be lawyers who specialize in getting other lawyers through the character and fitness process. (In Florida, for example, I'd send you to Brian Tannenbaum.) This is serious, and if you can find experienced counsel who deals with C F issues in your state, I urge you to use them. 




 I hope your interview went well, OP.

I saw this too late to be helpful to you, but for others who may stumble across this looking for advice in the future, I'd like to echo BlackLetterLaw's suggestion that one should research the firm and its attorneys. Try to find connections. Did anyone go to your law school or undergrad? Same clubs or interests? Did anyone publish articles or books you can skim? Were any of the attorneys you might meet involved in any landmark cases, Supreme Court cases, etc.? (One of the attorneys I interviewed with at one point was really impressed I asked him about his experience arguing before the Supreme Court. Apparently, I was the first person he interviewed who ever asked him about it. I didn't get the job, but it was clearly a point in my favor that I asked about it.)

You might be asked what book have you read recently, or what's your favorite book, etc. Have an answer. Lots of firms want people with intellectual curiosity.

Lots of law school's career services offer mock interviews. It's worthwhile. If they don't offer it, ask a professor if she or he would be willing to do a mock interview with you. Or a friend. It gives you the chance to develop answers and practice being put on the spot. BUT-don't practice so much that you are going off a completed script. Interviews are supposed to be a conversation. 




 Gee, I hope all our suspects are this much fun. 




 Other members of the Court may not engage in the sort of behavior the Act is intended to bar, but I don't think they would sanction Congress meddling with the internals workings of the Court. 




 Others have given you great advice (only need casebooks in class, use E Es for outlines, no need for bar chart stuff, etc.), but I'd also note that I highly, highly urge you to skim through the E Es now, in the next couple of weeks before class starts. I emphasize SKIM as opposed to study or read, just to know where to mentally categorize and place what you'll be learning during the semester. Do it now, while you have the time. 




 The Constitutionality of this is questionable. While Congress has the power to pass legislation that increases or decreases the size of the Court, and the power to pass laws that are precluded from judicial review, etc., something that affects the internal workings of the Court itself raises a separation of powers argument. Who would give the final word on whether it is Constitutional? *coughs* The Supreme Court. 




 I just took a cab via Uber from AU to home. There aren't many cabs that go past AU's law school, so street hailing is out. I can either call a DC cab company with absolutely no idea how long it will take to get a cab (sometimes a cab comes in 10 minutes, sometimes it's 30, or I can use Uber, pay $2 more, and know exactly how long it will take for the cab to arrive and where the cab is as it's coming.

 Right to work states don't mean that you aren't an at-will-employee or otherwise have any greater protection against being fired, it means it is harder for unionization. It's a pro-employer policy. 




 No, that's not exactly what Justice Kennedy is saying.

There are two types of standing. One is Article III standing and the other is prudential standing.

Article III standing comes from the Constitution, namely, Article III, and requires courts only get involved with an actual case or controversy. Unlike other countries, the US courts don't issue advisory opinions. (There's a whole list of things that go into whether there is an actual case or controversy that I won't go into here.)

Prudential standing requirements can be discarded by the courts whenever they find cause. They are self-imposed requirements, they are not Constitutionally mandated, so they can also be ignored at whim. 

Justice Kennedy is not saying the Supreme Court can ignore Article III standing or ignore jurisdiction. If there's no Article III standing, the Court can't hear the case. Same for jurisdiction. What he is saying is that just as a dieter can choose to make exceptions, be it an exception for one's birthday or for a particularly tasty-looking treat, the Court can decide to make exception to rules it imposes on itself. 




 This isn't a legal question, it's a factual question. Regrettably, without the tags, I'd wager the odds of police catching the person are nil. 




 Um, get a lawyer. Now. Not a reddit-appointed lawyer, an actual, licensed-in-California, criminal defense attorney.  




 Give Georgetown Bagelry (in Bethesda) a try. http://georgetownbagelry.com 




 Oy. My advice is for goodness sakes, get yourself a lawyer. Petty theft is a crime. Crimes are bad, and not the sort of thing you want on your record. If you are convicted or plead guilty, yes, it's may well be on your record permanently. Find a good lawyer in your jurisdiction. 




 The TL;DR is document review jobs are certainly better than having no job, or a lot of various minimum wage jobs, but they are the sweatshop of the legal world. See it as a temporary means of sustenance, not a long-term plan. 




 There is no possibility of advancement and there is no loyalty. Document review attorneys are expendable. You might get hired for a project only to be told the night before that they overhired, and "Oops, sorry, [click]." 

And while I can 't speak to the accuracy of all of what areyouinsane said in the link by anti09, he's definitely right that you generally find out the project is over by telephone. In my last doc review project before going back to school for my LL.M. and getting hired in a real job (now finishing up LL.M. part-time), as documents were running out, we'd go in for what was supposed to be a full day of work, go through all the documents in about 2 hours, and then be sent home (with no added pay, obviously, other than the 2 hours were worked) and told to call a recording to see if there were more documents. There were, but we were told to call every day. So there were 2 days of full work, another day told to go home after a few hours, a day of full work, and the next morning, the machine said the project was over and we should mail our badges for the building back. (At our expense, natch.) 




 (Oh, and if you have any specific questions, PM me.) :-) 




 One: Figure out how you're going to get to school. There's no parking for 1Ls in the garage underneath WCL, and if you park in the neighborhood around WCL, you will almost certainly get a $75 ticket from the school. If you need/want to drive to school, you have to park on main campus (paying the bucks for a parking pass) and take the free shuttle to school. Doable, but annoying. The free shuttles also go to the Tenleytown metro, so, that's a strong option.

Two: Some people take law school way too seriously. If you have no free time to spend with a significant other, never go out with friends, spend all your time in the library writing an outline the size of War and Peace, etc., you're trying too hard.

Three: Some people don't take law school seriously enough. If you're out at the bars every night and aren't doing the reading, etc., you're not trying hard enough. Grades do matter, especially in the less than great legal market.

Four: This doesn't apply to 1Ls, since you don't get choices, but when you get to pick classes your 2L and 3L years, DON'T pick classes based on the bar. What you need to know for the bar, you'll pick up in bar prep courses. 

DO pick classes based on professors. Professors make or break classes. Doesn't matter how exciting or dull a subject is. A good professor will make it amazing, a bad professor will make you wish you decided to become a sanitation worker instead of going to law school.

I suggest you take Evidence, because it's so fundamental to what lawyers do. Similarly, I strongly urge you to take Administrative Law. It touches upon almost every other area of law, so, it's really important to know. If you can, take Professor Popper's class. His exam is long but fair, and he is a wonderful professor.

Five: Do a clinic. Practical experience is vital, and it gives you the chance to learn and make mistakes in a safe environment with experienced practitioners guiding you and protecting you from harming your client or yourself.

Six: Network, network, network. Your internships and externships, be it during the summer or during the academic terms, are vital for getting jobs after graduation. Networking will help you get good internships and externships, and they'll help you get jobs.

Seven: Don't bother getting involved with the SBA. It's the equivalent of a high school student council but with even less real impact on the school and with more threats of lawsuits over silly things that don't matter a damn.

Eight: Do try for law review, and you don't get chosen for the main law review, join one of the briefs.

Nine: Go to office hours. Make sure professors know you and you know them, so when you need help getting an internship or job, etc., professors will a: have nice things to say about you, and b: want to help you.

 I agree that the use of the FISA court has been appalling, however, I don't see how a President can be impeached for using a law the way it was designed to be used, going through a judicial review process (as weak as the FISA process is), and keeping Congress properly informed. This wasn't Bush's NSA scandal, where the NSA went after the content of domestic calls without even going through the motions of a warrant from the FISA court. This was for the phone records, not content, which involve a lesser expectation of privacy and all branches of government were involved. Unconstitutional? Yes, personally, I think it is. Awful? Yes, personally, I think it is. 

A high crime or misdemeanor meriting impeachment of the President? If it is, you'd also need to impeach the judges who heard the FISA cases and expel the members of Congress who authorized it (given that the PATRIOT Act was passed nearly unanimously, somehow I doubt that will happen).

This was not unilateral action akin to other Presidential scandals, such as Watergate, Iran-Contra, etc. 




 If flights can't be obtained, it might be worth figuring out the cost of a town car service. It's pricey, but more reliable. For something this important, reliability is key. 




 Really? Who else besides Dartmouth plays pong with paddles? 




 Russ Feingold is now a former politician, but given that he was the only person with both the courage and intelligence to vote against the PATRIOT Act in the first place, he deserves a huge amount of respect. 




 It's a matter of personal preference. The tradeoff is probably screensize versus weight. 

You're going to be lugging your laptop everywhere. How much are you willing to schlep, on top of casebooks that outweigh many dictionaries?

When you write papers, are you going to want the space to have a Lexis or Westlaw window next to your word processing window or are you okay flipping back and forth between the two? Hard to do the side-by-side thing on a 13" laptop, at least without squinting. That's why I prefer the 17". On the other hand, it's heavier than I'd likenow that I'm commuting from work to night classes for the LL.M., I must confess I find myself using an iPad and an external keyboard for notetaking more often than not because it's easier to carry.

SSD is entirely unimportant if you're just using it for law school related work. You don't need to spend that much cash on boosting the speed of saving OneNote or Word files.

I don't think the issue is necessarily one of keyboard quality, so much as it's keyboard comfort. The quality is pretty much universal assuming you're not buying a laptop that's supposedly a mainstream US laptop but is coming in a battered box that suspiciously only has Asian lettering on it and you found it for $150 from a guy on Canal Street. Comfort is a personal choice. What size keys, what layout, how much give the keys have, etc., all can differ from manufacturer to manufacturer (if not laptop to laptop). I urge you to go try them out in the Apple Store or Microsoft Store or Costco or (if you must) Best Buy (boo, hiss), instead of ordering one sight unseen. 




 Not sure why my responses have been downvoted, and perhaps this will meet the same fate, but an op-ed by Esther Lardent over at the National Law Journal touches upon the conflict of interest issue (albeit in an entirely different context), writing, "Particularly concerning is the notion of imputed disqualification, the ethical construct that if one lawyer in a large legal setting has a conflicts issue, all lawyers in that institution are presumed to share the same information and conflict." In a 50 state+ scenario, one lawyer with a conflicts issue can disqualify everyone. The more clients, the more potential conflicts. 




 This was a poor decision. From what I have read, it was not arbitrary or capricious to keep a 10-year-old off the adult lung transplant list because medically, it is less likely that an adult lung transplant would be successful. It would not necessarily fit or function. Instead of saving a 10 year old, you might have killed the adult who would have otherwise gotten the lungs. 




 Oh! It's my cake day! How did I miss that?! (Oh, right. 8.5 hours of work followed by 2.1 hours of school.) Thank you! :-) 




 The linked article itself says that he was not promoted to Admiral. 




 Preemption, preemption, preemption. It's a waste of time and money, with a 0% chance of surviving judicial review. 




 I like Professor Kerr, but I disagree with him that it is a love of Fourth Amendment balancing that moves Justice Breyer. I believe it's outcomes, a results-oriented jurisprudence that moves him in these cases.

A friend of mine had a 4th Amendment school case go to the Supreme Court in which she was the plaintiff. A few years later, she and I were both at a small meeting with Justice Breyer with the opportunity to talk to him, and she introduced herself and asked why he ruled against her. His answer was that he was worried about the dangers and prevalence of drugs in schools. That the decision was not congruous with precedent did not seem to matter, nor did he make a legal argument when asked the question. His was a simple outcome-oriented response. 




 I suppose I'm not surprised... Justice Scalia has often (albeit not to the level of "commonly") joined the "liberal" wing of the court in criminal procedure cases, and Justice Breyer's practical or outcome-oriented jurisprudence is often underestimated in media analyses. 




 Watch and learn as much as you can, and work as hard as you can so when you want a internship or recommendation as a law student, they happily give it to you. 




 Nobody is accusing him of committing a crime as far as I know. Ethical violations, yes. But the sanction for those is suspension or loss of a law license, not imprisonment. 




 (Heck, some states have nebulous rules about what firms can post online. The Florida Bar hotline claims that every tweet or Facebook post must include the name of the lawyer, firm, and office address.) 









 Lots of firms operate in multiple states. No firms operate in all 50. 

As I said, not all state ethical rules are congruous. Everything from the firm name to who can be on the letterhead, to what offices must be listed on the letterhead, to various duties, etc., all are governed by different rules depending on the state.

DLA Piper, the firm other has listed in this thread as one of the closest things to OP's question, has offices in New York, Georgia, Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Florida, Minnesota, New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, Washington, Delaware, and DC. A lot of jurisdictions to juggle, but that's 17 jurisdictions. Not 50 states plus DC. 




 It would be an ethical impossibility. Remember, every state has its own ethical rules and every state's ethical rules are difference. One cannot comply with all of them.

Worse, think of the conflicts of interest. Screening for conflicts on a scale that large is impractical, and every matter a firm takes on limits matters it can handle in other contexts. 

The tl;dr is that this wouldn't be a path to riches, it's a pathway to loss of licenses. 




 Heh. It takes about 45 minutes each way by bus/metro for me to get to work every day, so, I have some time to read. :P 




 Thanks for the suggestion. I read both of their books over the past few days. I enjoyed Evans book as a companion to Lipstadt's, but I'm glad I read her's first. I don't think Evans does a great job setting the scene and providing context, but with the background and details I had from reading Lipstadt's book, Evans did a great job filling in his part of the story.

Guttenplan's was an interesting read for an outside observer's view of the trial. He seemed self-contradictory in a few places if not obtuse, but still worth a read. 




 If you want something non-fiction, legal, but light (in terms of the intended audience, not in tone), go for Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips's "Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism." It's written for the lay audience, so, it meets the light category.

In 1906, Ed Johnson, a black man, was accused of raping a white woman. He was tried and convicted by an all-white jury. Two local attorneys appealed his case to Justice Harlan, the circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit, who agreed to have the Supreme Court hear the case. After the Court issued a stay-of-execution, Johnson was lynched.

The Court was outraged, perhaps more at the mob thwarting its order than at the loss of life itself, and the Court accused those it deemed responsible of contempt of Court in the case US v. Shipp. This was the only criminal trial the Supreme Court has ever held, with Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, his chief jailer, and some members of the lynch mob as defendants.

It's well written, an easy read on an interesting subject, and I think that if you aren't over-lawed from bar studying, it's a good choice. 




 Er, at this point, wouldn't it have been more accurate to describe them as shoplifters and not customers?

 First, that's an entirely different question from your original premise.

Second, did you listen to his speech, in person or through the live stream? I did. He didn't deliver anything other the standard law school graduation speech. Not a question of fault, not calling him a bad speaker, but it's the sort of thing nearly everyone delivers. He didn't deliver any unique insights. 




 Bull feathers. The role of a government lawyer is to use his or her professional judgment. The current rumor is that President Obama will be picking James B. Comey as his nominee to head the FBI. Comey was the Deputy Attorney General in the GWB administration from Dec. '03-Aug '05, and during that time, he famously refused to sign off on extending the NSA's illegal warrantless spying.

Here is what Comey had to say on this subject: "The lawyer is the custodian of so much. The custodian of our own personal reputations, surely. But more importantly, the custodian of our institutional reputations. And most importantly of all,the custodian of our constitution and the rule of law.It is the job of a good lawyer to say 'yes.' It is as much the job of a good lawyer to say 'no.' 'No' is much, much harder. 'No' must be spoken into a storm of crisis, with loud voices all around, with lives hanging in the balance. 'No' is often the undoing of a career.And often, 'no' must be spoken in competition with the voices of other lawyers who do not have the courage to echo it. For all those reasons, it takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say 'no' when it matters most. It takes moral character."

 Or maybe midgets. 




 That's an unfair way of phrasing the question. Prominent people from both sides of the aisle speak at WCL all the time. Liberals go to hear speakers from the Federalist Society or from the ACLJ. Conservatives go to hear from the Legal Defense Fund or the ACLU. But there's a big difference between speaking at a school and speaking at a school's graduation.

Had Koh spoken on campus (not during graduation), there would have been massive attendance, some pointed questions during the Q A session, and a worthwhile exchange of ideas.

Graduation speeches are a 1-way communication and they are not a place to give a platform for controversy. The focus should be on the graduates. 

For the record, regardless of my beliefs as to the legality of the drone program, I don't find Koh objectionable. I don't think his reading of the law is over the line, the way the Bush Office of Legal Counsel was with the torture memos. My quibble is with EthanB00's claim that WCL students don't want to hear from those they disagree with. 




 Good grief. I suspect he's the type most likely to fail. Burnout and all that.

No matter what bar prep course you take, how many old exams you look at, or how many hours you spend, odds are high you'll come across a question you didn't study for. Maybe they haven't tested secured transactions in 11 years and it's your lucky day, they decided to bring it back. Maybe it's a hybrid question that's confusing you. Whatever it is, you still need to be able to look at it, think like a lawyer, and even if you have to make up the law, write a cogent, lawyerly analysis. Partial credit goes a long way. If you're fried from going into hermitage to study exclusively, you're not going to be in any condition to analyze anything new.

The bar exam is hard, but it's not THAT hard. And it's pass/fail. Every point you get above passing is a point you should have spent in the sun. 




 If they are changing you to a position that offers lower pay, do you need to give them 2 weeks notice? What exactly was in that contract you signed? 




 OK, thanks for the kind correction. :-) 




 Excellent! I requested it from my local library, so, it should hopefully be in my hands within the next few days. 




 I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm certainly no expert in British law, but my understanding is that the burden of proof in British libel cases is on the defendant. This means defendants have show that what they said was the truth (or some other defense).

Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the appropriate compensatory damages, but the burden of proof is not on the plaintiff to show that the alleged defamatory words were false, but rather, on the defendant to show that they were true or another defense applies. Getting punitive damages is harder than compensatory damage. Punitive damages require demonstrating actual malice.

Again, I'm no expert on British law. This is my understanding from what I've read, and if I'm wrong, I welcome correction. 




 Ooh-thanks! I wasn't aware of those. I'm looking into getting them from the library now! 




 Then I don't understand your argument that there needs to be laws limiting lawyer compensation. It's a free market. Lawyers set their prices and clients decide whether or not to hire a particular lawyer.

In the current scenario, about the court-appointed trustees, sure, they are getting a great deal of money from the case, but they have also recovered a great deal of money for Madoff's victims. Could the court have found lawyers to do it for less? Absolutely. Would those lawyers have done as good or a better job? Not necessarily.  




 I agree with almost everything you've said except your third point about the Irving v. Lipstadt trial. David Irving was the plaintiff, not the defendant, which might go towards your claim that libel is a hard claim to win, but the trial occurred in Great Britain where libel cases are much easier to win.

Dooperdoo's post was rather misleading when he said that Irving ran afoul of Lipstadt. Lipstadt made a few minor references to him, and Irving picked the fight. He chose to sue. It would be more accurate to say that Lipstadt ran afoul of Irving. Irving got demolished in the courtroom. It became clear that the sting of Lipstadt's words about him were absolutely true. Given how badly Irving looked during and after the trial, some felt sympathy for him and blamed Lipstadt for the decimation of Irving's reputation. This, of course, ignores or forgets that it was Irving who sued Lipstadt, attacking her reputation and livelihood as a scholar, not vice versa, and that Irving's lawsuit required Lipstadt prove Irving was a holocaust denier or at the least, an ally of deniers.

Lipstadt wrote a really worthwhile book on the subject, titled "History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier." It's not every day one comes across a memoir about a court experience that turns out to be a page-turner. 




 I went to a college with a non-traditional schedule, allowing people to take off a Fall, Winter, or Spring term for internships and make it up with a full summer-term of classes. I interned for the Department of Justice for a Winter and got to do the sort of paralegal work that in the summer, they have law students do.

If you have any degree of flexibility at your school, try for something other than a summer, so you aren't up against all the law students.

Negot8or is right about the issues of unauthorized practice of law, but that's solvable if they put you to use in the paralegal type of role, with some discovery screening, drafting, basic research, etc. 




 I can't imagine a LL.M. would give a damn about your LSAT score. LSAT programs allegedly have some sort of correlation with 1L grades, which is why law schools use the test. Now that you actually have law school grades, I'd think the LSAT would be meaningless for LL.M. admission.

As a J.D. grad of the school I'm going to for my LL.M., I believe I had an abridged application process, and if they wanted my LSAT score, it would already be in their files, but there was no mention of the score in the application process I went through. 




 I had an unpaid summer clerkship with the US Marshals Service's Office of General Counsel during the summer between being a 1L and 2L. They required a drug test. They also required an SF-85 which specifically asks about prior drug use.

 As others have said, tort reform has nothing to do with limiting lawyer compensation, it has to do with limiting the amount of money victims of bad behavior or mistakes can recover.

Doctors and some others think that this will reduce the amount of insurance they pay, but it doesn't work that way. In states that have implemented tort reform, insurance premiums continued to rise. Why? Because doctors' lawsuit exposure or not, insurance companies raise rates to make more money.

Tort reform is also desired by big corporations as a means of both limiting the amount of exposure they have to lawsuits and as a way to help budget in lawsuits as a cost of doing business. One of the purposes of punitive damages is to provide a significant deterrent to the defendant or others to engage in bad behavior. Capping punitive damages does away with the deterrence effect-it can now be factored in as a business expense, as a known, fixed externality. 




 What really pisses me off is all the people commenting on the initial reports by blaming Sarah McClay for alleging getting herself killed. People faulted her for going where she wasn't supposed to be, or being on a cellphone, etc., when it turns out, she was just doing her job the way she was told to do it. Not her fault.

I'm sure her friends and family were reading some of those articles and some of those comments, and it would have been cruel to write those comments even had they been true. But they weren't. 




 There's no such thing as a "social media riot" and there is nothing punishable about inspiring others to speak out. His "harassment" of the principal was protected speech unless it caused a substantial and material disruption at school. Lots of people speaking up on twitter isn't a disruption.

Using his cell phone in class is punishable. Punishing him for the content of his tweets is not okay unless there is important information missing from the press accounts. 




 Schools are NOT the equivalent of an employer-one chooses to work or not for an employer, whereas students are compelled to attend school. 




 The main case on student speech is still Tinker v. Des Moines, which beyond flowery words about rights of students not stopping at the schoolhouse gate also gives us the need to demonstrate that the prohibited or punished speech would materially and substantially interfere with school discipline/operation. While there's been some narrowing with Bethel, Kuhlmeier, and Morse, there hasn't been much added to Supreme Court jurisprudence that applies to student speech generally.

Circuit and district courts, dealing with online speech, have come up with a variety of tests to determine if it should be treated the same as in-school speech or given more protection (such as in the Third Circuit's rulings in Layshock v. Hermitage School District, and the final ruling in J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District). Here, the facts are different because the tweets themselves were made from on-campus. I suspect that would lead a court to say that the tweets are on-campus speech, but even then, that only allows punishment if the disruption requirement of Tinker is met. I don't see any evidence of a disruption or potential for disruption. Instead, the school punished student speech it didn't like because it didn't like it, and that's a First Amendment violation and grounds for a 42 U.S.C. 1983 suit. 




 Here's a link to reddiquette. http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette I draw your attention to the last line that says "[Please don't c]omplain about cross posts. Just because you saw it in one place, doesn't mean everyone has seen it. Just vote and move on." 

Yeah. I missed your post in /r/news and I deleted my link after you called my attention to yours. Your complaint here is unwarranted. 




 If you have Amazon Prime, there are three seasons of Good Eats available. 




 Darn. Missed it. Sorry. 




 A school can certainly punish a student for using a cell-phone in class, but punishing him for the content of his tweets seems unconstitutional. The tweets listed in the article do not rise to the level of a substantial or material disruption of the schoolhouse environment. 

No disruption+pure speech=First Amendment protected speech (leaving aside discussion of exceptions for lewd speech, speech promoting illicit drug use, etc.).

Assuming that the punishment for using a cell phone to tweet in class would not have been 3 days suspension (without punishment for content of the tweets), said student would seem to have grounds to sue the school and the school officials involved in his suspension. I don't see grounds to claim qualified immunity on a case this basic.

 I'm perplexed. What is the distinction between quitting and resigning? 




 Some schools look at your highest score, others will average your LSAT scores. Might be worthwhile taking the time to get it right the first time. On the other hand, in case something goes horribly wrong at the test center, it's a good idea to not leave it to the last minutehaving an opportunity to do a redo if need be is best. 




 The footage from KFOR and News9 is scary... I hope the folks in Shawnee make it okay. 














 Well-named. They are adorable. 




 Yep. Preempted. Food labeling is within the purview of the FDA under the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. The NLEA explicitly preempts state labeling laws that are not identical to the requirements of the NLEA. 21 U.S.C.  343-1. Between the FDCA and the NLEA, there's a very strong argument that anything not explicitly preempted by the NLEA is still implicitly preempted by the federal statutes occupying the field. 














 Well, I'm glad you posted it. I hadn't seen this one before. 




 I loved my StarTac. Best thing about flip phones is the ability to hang up on people by slamming it shut. Try hanging up in anger on a smartphone and you're liable to break a finger! 




 You can't understand why someone who was traumatized by being drugged and gang-raped by colleagues, and treated as a criminal instead of a victim by police, might do whatever she was told to try to make the threats and harassment stop? Really? 




 I think the hardest 1L subject is Property, and no, not just because of the dreaded Rule Against Perpetuity. The other 1L courses offer a overarching, cohesive (or semi-cohesive) structure to study. Everything fits together pretty neatly in Torts, or Contracts, things are at the least interconnected in Con Law and obv. goes back to one document, Civ Pro probably has the most cohesive structure, etc., but 1L Property is made up of the bits that weren't important enough to be their own class. 

Real Estate transactions are mostly in their own class, Landlord/Tenant matters are mostly in their own class, Wills, Trusts and Estates has its own class, etc. Property is the stitched-together leftovers, with all the coherence of the monster in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Personally, I suggest replacing Property with Administrative Law. It's a subject lawyers are far more likely to encounter. 




 Although obvious, it's worth reiterating a law exam grade is just how well you did on that one day, at that one time, on that one exam. It's not necessarily a reflection of how smart you are, how hard you studied, or how much you learned in a term.

Good Guy Law Professor at the end of one of my classes this year said he'd be willing to write us a recommendation regardless of what we got in his class precisely because he understood the above.
