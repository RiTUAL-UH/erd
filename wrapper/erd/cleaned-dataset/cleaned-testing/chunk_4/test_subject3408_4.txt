 This probably isn't such a good advice but anyways. When I told my dad about my depression he told me he'd be with me and help me through it. Bullshit. He avoided me, he disregarded it, almost stopped talking to me. I know my dad probably didn't know what to do in his situation but I feel like I hate him for abandoning me when he told me he would help me though it.
It got much better between me and him when I told him a few months  after that it was just a phase. It wasn't. 

BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU SAY.
