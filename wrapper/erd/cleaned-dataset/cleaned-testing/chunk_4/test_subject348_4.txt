 next door.. the "else" house 














 A rich billionaire Sheikh sends his son to a university in the US. He buys his son a gold plated Ferrari so that he can commute from his house to the university everyday.
A couple of weeks in, he gets really upset and sends an email to his dad:
Dad, all my friends in the university use the public transport .. usually a train .. to come to university. I feel really embarrassed to be driving around in a gold Ferrari.

Next day, the Sheikh responds: Don't worry son. I've just transferred $10 million to your account. Go buy urself a train.
