 I'm tempted too. If I can't fix it I'm selling it 




 Here's Part 1 incase you missed it.

I had another experience and I believe I now know the cause of what has been happening at our house. Originally we thought that the house that had burned down before ours may have claimed an unlucky soul, but after further research I discovered that everyone that had been living at that house had all survived. I wasn't sure how i felt about discovering this. I wasn't sure if I was glad that no one was injured or not. What happened was where the house used to be was in between my neighbors house and ours. Once it burnt down the land was split between two properties. How could the house be haunted if no one was injured? Then what could have been causing everything that has been happening at the house. Was the original fire an accident?

Last night we were all tucked into bed ready for a good night sleep. I had brought my girlfriends sons bed into the room with us; to make sure he would be able to sleep after the other night. I was fast asleep as well as my girlfriend too when we heard her son calling for me. I sat up to see if everything was all right and he was laying in bed with his eyes wide open. He said in a very calm yet nervous tone, "My bed slid towards the closet, can you please close the door?". The bed was no longer parallel to the closet, but the front of the bed(where his head lays) was pointed towards the open closet door open. Thinking fast I told him to just come to bed with us because I had to move his bed to get something. (This was a lie but there was no point into sending him into a panic state) Why was the closet door open? My girlfriend always closed the door before she went to bed because she couldn't sleep with it open. I shut the door and jumped back into bed, just hoping to sleep through the night.

This is when things began to really go south. When I woke up I noticed I couldn't open my eyes or move my body what so ever. I thought oh just sleep paralysis, my body will wake up eventually. It didn't. All of the sudden I heard a weird bird outside shriek and my chest began to tighten up. It felt as if a 500 pound person was standing on my chest. I then began to panic. I started sweating bullets from the heat and short breaths, and my arm that had been laying across my neck began to push down on my neck. I was choking and I couldn't scream and couldn't defend myself. I was helpless as I was slowly suffocating. All I could do was say a prayer in my head. As soon as I finished everything went back to normal. I was awake and so was my body. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. I just sat awake and made sure my girlfriend and her son were all right.

My grandpa had told me stories of demons that sit on the chest of sleeping victims. They are incubus and the succubus. These demons are known for sitting on the chests of men and women asleep. What these demons are known for is that it can take either a female or male shape and will sit on the sleepers chest and could even sleep with that human. If a female is slept with this demon they could be impregnated by that demon. If a male sleeps with that demon the demon could take over the males body. I wasn't touched that way by the demons nor will i allow them too. Also they will try and kill infants. They are easily researched and widely believed. I fell like that is what has been happening at this house. And the "Man that lives underneath our house" really does live underneath our house. Just much farther down than originally believed. I'm very scared for my girlfriend and her son and myself. Good thing my Grandpa has dealt with demons and spirits so I am going to fight this evil spirit. He used to be a white witch in Ireland before making his way to the states. He is very knowledgeable about demons and fighting demons. Much of the same as a priest, just not a religious figure. I will post a part three telling you guys what I am going to do about the demon that is ruining our lives. Also I will explain other ways to protect yourself from evil. Wish us luck.
