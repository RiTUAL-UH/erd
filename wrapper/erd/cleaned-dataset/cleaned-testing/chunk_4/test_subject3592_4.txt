 How old is your laptop? On my previous laptop (also Lenovo) I used to have lots of intermittent disconnects and slow speed. 

A CS student told me that it was probably because my wifi card didn't support the new IllinoisNet standards (you know, the b/g/n stuff) and so I couldn't get maximum speeds out of it. That might explain why your roommate continues to surf on the waves of the blue ocean while you languish with a surfboard in quicksand.

I know it does matter because with a new laptop, my connection problems have almost disappeared. 




 So, this is my photostream on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps . None (or maybe one somewhere) of those photos is processed. I had stayed away from processing because of two reasons:

1. I believed that, as a beginner, I needed to learn how to take photographs
2. I was lazy

I decided some time back that I was just avoiding processing for no real reason and everyone was doing it anyway. So I decided I would learn Lightroom. I actually posted on here and got great feedback on learning how to use Lightroom (http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/xc64s/postprocessing/) 

My first chance to use my skills on photos from a recent trip to Yosemite.

Here are my thoughts:

1. **While taking pictures**, I was less worried about the getting the settings right. At one point, getting the camera back from a friend, I continued shooting in Auto and thinking to myself that the overexposure could easily be fixed in Lightroom. I realized even at that point in time that I wasn't enjoying myself with taking pictures as much as I usually do. The composition half was the same, of course, but I was no longer playing with settings and irritating my friend to stand still while I tried various combinations.

2. **While processing** I really hated correcting the setting mistakes. I was really ashamed of the pics that were underexposed, overexposed etc. _It turns out that at some point in my discovery of photography, I had grown to love the process of making sure the composition and settings were right in camera_.

3. **While processing** I really, really came to love the crop tool. Having never used it before, I had never imagined that just cutting out part of a photo could be so powerful in getting the feeling I want from a photograph across.

4. Processing takes up much more time than I thought and as far as Lightroom is concerned, is very monotonous. Lightroom is designed to reduce this monotony, I know. But it's still a pain..

Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there and get some opinions from /r/photography on the whole processing...process. None of my friends are into photography like I am, so reddit is where I talk about this stuff. What do you guys post-process for? What's your philosophy on it?

I think I see the point of processing for professional photographers, where the end product is all-important. But for me, I think I will stay away from post-processing (except for cropping, that shit is awesome) and _enjoy the process of taking the pictures_ more. 

**tl;dr** Tried post-processing...see the point, but don't really think it's for me. What do you guys think?

 I'm using the Windows 8 free consumer preview right now. It's not too shabby. The thing is, for me, Metro turned out to be a gimmick. I used it a lot in the first few weeks and then hardly ever after. I'm on the desktop side where it's not really distinguishable from Windows 7. Well, that Start Button is missing, but typing *Super+Q* instead of *Super* wasn't too much of a stretch.

It does look better and the animations seem more mature for sure.

Though if I had to pay, I wouldn't upgrade.

 I am trying to buy backpacks for 3-4 day trips. Any suggestions?

What size (L) should I go with? 

I've been looking at REI.com and backcountry.com, but they seem well...too expensive.

I was looking to buy something below $120, am I being unreasonable? 

I don't want bells and whistles, just a backpack that will last through a lot of trips. 




 It depends. Waves interfere. The sounds from the two machines may cancel each other out, add on to each other or any combination in between depending on the relative phase of the waves.

Also, decibels are a logarithmic scale. 




 Especially since you're sending 4 texts over two months. That's perfectly fine. 




  don't take nice pictures, take useful pictures.
  I want to feel it

All this is after you take lots of pictures. Take pictures. Crappy pictures of air conditioners where you obsess over the angle of the vents. Pictures of dogs, where you try to frame one nostril and a leaf. You get the idea. 

It's like that common saying that you need 10000 hours to become an expert. If you want to feel, you have to learn to feel. Just keep taking pictures. 

INTERNALIZE ALL THE CONCEPTS!

You should be having fun taking pictures. Take your camera everywhere, or at least walk it on a tight leash for an hour every day. Eventually you'll find that the camera is asking you to click pictures of that strange glow on the sidewalk at night.

**tl;dr: The more you internalize, the less you have to think about while shooting** 




 Yes, the horse's eye. No...Red eye removal did not work at all. IT complained that it couldn't detect a red eye.

I thought that was what Lens Flare is...it isn't? 




 So, All my google searching seemed to indicate that Lightroom is a bad choice for removing Lens Flare. Is this true? 

Is there anyway I can remove Lens Flare in Lightroom? 

The image is here: http://i.imgur.com/fvsFC.jpg

EDIT: I wanted to post the whole image, but got permission only for the cropped version..

 Oh nice :) I actually researched cavitation for quite a bit when I was getting my MS, but it completely slipped my mind when replying to this question!

So cavitation would prevent the onset of supersonic flow itself?

EDIT: Some googling reveals that shock waves in water are indeed, different from shock waves in air...They do exist though. Cool :) 




 It would be the same. Shockwaves et al. The speed of sound is in fact a measure (well sort of) of the compressibility of a medium. In a truly incompressible medium, speed of sound is infinity.

So a torpedo breaking the speed of sound would cause a very similar reaction as in air. The answer is similar for your second question as well.

Though, the shockwave might decay sooner due to the higher viscosity of water. This is something I'm not fully sure of...

Also, of course, the drag of the torpedo is much, much higher and the speed of sound is also much, much higher, so getting to the supersonic region would be pretty much impossible.

**tl;dr** Speed of sound is infinity in incompressible medium. There are no shockwaves in incompressible flow.
 




 I don't understand your question:

1/ What purpose is the rope serving? 
2/ Why aren't we just talking about the planets? What are the objects for?

 




 I had RES, but hadn't noticed the Save function...Thanks! 




 No no. I guess we're arguing semantics. My point is a philosophical one and I do agree that at some point in the details, the why merges with the how. Scientists believe that if you start with the merged question, you will get answers to both even on a higher level. Well, I believe that's true too.

But while we don't have the answers, we have to work with our individual senses of beauty. 




 Which guy? I'm talking about aesthetics relative to us.

I think aesthetics and artistry are useful "black boxes" for detailed scientific processes in our body which we don't understand fully. 

It's like programming in a high level language without knowing assembly. 




 I came here to say "Yes. Refraction", but I see this a much deeper question. So I will just comment so that I can easily get back to this thread and wait for the answer :) 




 Umm...When a scientist asks "Why?", he really means "How?", which refers to the underlying mechanisms that get the sound out of the bird and how that sound is heard by humans and interpreted as song by a combination of stuff happening in the brain.

When an artist looks at a bird singing, he/she takes all of the above for granted and looks at the aesthetic qualities of the song. These aesthetic qualities are subjective. By subjective, I mean that they involve a lot of processes in the brain and science still hasn't got to that point.

My opinion, that would be. 




 Fuck...Can't believe I've spent 3 years on KDE not noticing that!!

Thanks...well....a lot!

 Yes, of course. Light travels. Light is received. Sight is made.

EDIT: Sorry, I think I misunderstood.

So..   T=0, you're on earth.  
T=0, you're in space  
T=1 year, you see yourself from space and then teleport back.  
T=2 years, you see yourself in space.   

That works. 




 Barring all the physical laws that might be broken, yes. 




 Getting down voted because those questions sort of have answers. 

The Turing test is considered a reasonable measure of AI.

Intelligence itself has many definitions and AI researchers are working to meet all of them 
 




 There's no point using them _instead_ of exercise. They do help in muscle building, because they're proteins.

You don't need them unless you're doing a _lot_ of weights, etc. They're needed basically, if you're exercising more than the protein you can get from your daily diet (so it depends on whether you're vegetarian too).

**tl;dr** They do what they say.  




 Thanks! Will keep at it :) 




 Okay. I can do 60 kg wooden plank, facing the wind (i.e. the wind is blowing on the flat side).

Drag coefficient of flat plate = 1.17

Force on plate = Cd * 0.5 * V2 (velocity squared) * S (area)

Let S = 180 * 30 (6ft by 1ft) cm^2 = 0.54 m^2

So force is = 0.3159 V2

This force will act through the center of the plank.

Now imagine a plank standing on it's side and weighing 74 kg (my weight). Thickness of the plank is 30 cm (0.3 m), i.e. my foot.

Now the weight will act through the center of mass of the plank, i.e. 0.15 m from the edge. 

So the moment due to the weight will be 74 * 9.8 * 0.15 ( 9.8 is gravity). = 108.78 N-m 

The drag (force due to wind) acts through half the height of the plank (90 cm = 0.9 m). So the moment is

0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9

So equating both moments

0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9  = 108.78

i.e v = 19.5 m/s

i.e. Works out to **43 mph.**

I had assumed I would get an answer closer to 80 despite the fact that this analysis assumes that the plank doesn't exert any force to stay upright, but oh well :) 

********
Well, Wikipedia says that drag coefficient for a tall flat plate is 1.98!!

So the drag force will now be 108.78 * 1.98/1.17 = 184.089

And so the new speed will be **53 mph**.

Not bad...But really, I think all that's missing is to increase the net drag because the human will also exert a moment to stay upright.

EDIT: Also missing is the fact that a non-perpendicular wind would need to be stronger...Phew 




 I don't think we're doing the whole calculations consciously. 

What we're doing (I think, and from a weak robotics background and observation) is akin to closed loop control. We guess where the baseball is going to be and keep our hands there. Then keep updating the position of our hand as we keep observing the baseball.

This way, we only need to do basic math (move hand delta left/right/up/down/forward/back) instead of complete calculations (move hand to (x,y,z) ). These calculations are much simpler and don't need to take into account a million different things.
 




 Manning up seems to involve not doing something every man does ;-)

Yes, I see your point :) I'm trying, I'm trying! 




 No. No one's given up.

It's not only a matter of finding out which senses to provide (which in itself is very complicated).

For one, the number of parallel computations in the brain is far beyond what any computer today is capable of. Also, AI is being approached from a thousand different angles.

Take the simple thing Input - Process - Output. Research is focusing on learning (i.e. making a robot learn) how to categorize input, to learn how to process, to learn how to output. And every combination and small step in between.

In a senior level AI course that I took, the professor told us this at the beginning: "People think we have 1 mile to go, and so the media tells us we're almost there. The truth is we've gone 5 miles and now we think there's 100 miles to go"

It is also very important to realize that AI has actually overtaken the brain in many things. Machine learning algorithms can take many decisions faster and better than their human counterparts, as evidenced by tests on medical diagnoses, fly-by-wire systems. To me somehow, even though these things aren't "true" intelligence, it is just as impressive. 

Anyway the definition of "true" intelligence comes from our intelligence, so we're inherently biased ;-)

In my opinion however, before pure AI reaches intelligence, we'll all be hybrids, ala Ghost in the Shell. 
 




 How do you guys manage?

I'm trying and so far here's my record:

2 days-Reset-1 day-Reset-1 day-Rest ... 

Sigh... 




 Oh yes yes maybe. I have the ATT version and the T-mobile one has more than mine for sure.

But it doesn't _really_ matter. There are always devs porting ROMs all around the place.

EDIT: Not sure where you can check this. But galaxys2root.com is a good place for the S2. If you just poke around XDA long enough, you'll suddenly find one day that you have an opinion! 




 I can answer some questions:

Will the S2 be outdated anytime soon? I know that it won't be getting Jellybean, how much will I be missing?

I don't think it'll be "too outdated", i.e. it'll only feel outdated if you feel jealous of people who will have better phones than you. It will be able to everything you want.

Unofficial Jellybean builds are already out. I used Jellybean for a few days. Was a lot of fun. Google now is really cool. You have to root, of course.

How big is the switch from Gingerbread to ICS? 

ICS is like Windows XP to Windows 7

If I root the phone, can I get rid of the bloatware that service provider install on the phone ?

Yes.

Can I brick the phone while rooting? If yes can it be unbricked?

Yes. Yes.

Can the S2 be used as a wifi hotspot for my ipad? I know it can be done with android tablet but I'm not sure about the ipad.

It can be used as a hotspot yes. I can't see why anything that can connect to wifi can't connect to it.

Does the phone matter when used as a hotspot i.e. any differences (network-wise) between S2 and an older android phone? -What's the best variant of the S2 to buy, I think I got some choices between i9100, i9100P, i9100G and the T-mobile's one (SGH-T989)?

No idea. But the T-mobile phone has more ROMs, so more hacking fun.

Just to make sure I'm not missing on anything: is there any better choice than the S2? Something with the lastest hardware/software like the S3 but with similar shape/form factor as the S2/Ip4?

Of course everything with better hardware is better! 




 Aerospace Engineer here, but guessing nevertheless!

1/ The wind conditions would be very very unpredictable for one. Lack in wind and the rover doesn't land. We don't have wind measurements at all the heights that the Mars rover is going to land in, so calibrating the supply would be a big headache.

2/ Power requirements: Maybe whatever they're using is just more efficient. Maybe it's easier to design.

3/ A rotating thing in space just seems to make bad engineering sense to me. One broken blade, one screw comes loose and everything goes to the dogs. No moving parts unless necessary (I see you have something against comments that mention moving parts, but really...even if there were a hundred moving parts and you could avoid the next one, you should. Moving parts suck)

4/ There is probably a complicated control law governing the output of the supply. Such output control would be much harder with a wind turbine, whose output actually depends on external factors, which is not the case for the thermoelectric supply.

**tl;dr**: Hard to predict, hard to control, hard to build  




 The tiles are for shielding. The material is what makes the difference. I don't think anything else really matters.

I saw a demonstration once where a guy held a space shuttle tile from one side. A flame torch was blown on the other side for more than 5 minutes and the heat didn't reach his hand at all! The material is really, really heat resistant. 

And a lot of them are white too :-/

EDIT: Added a comma. 




 Those are some useful suggestions....Thanks a lot for taking the time!

Really cool pictures...I was going to move to 500px, but after seeing the pics of people who've added me as a contact, I'm going to stay on Flickr!  




 Yeah, I've read a lot about the stuff that was done in the dark room, and the stuff Ansel Adams did. That's where the choice of many of the tools and presets available in Lightroom and similar software comes from, right :) 




 Thanks a lot! Yeah, it was a lot of fun :) 




 Thanks a lot!!  




 Yup. I knew that and do agree with all that you say :)  




 I actually have access to Lynda through university! Thanks a lot!! That's what I'll do now! 




 That's what I'm doing right now. But I was afraid I would get stuck without knowing if I what I was doing was actually improving the picture ;-) 




 True that. Making the switch immediately! 




 I started taking pictures a few years back and didn't do any processing. More so because I was lazy to learn than anything else.

My photostream is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps (Just lost pro status, sorry!). None of the photos on there are processed. I used to be proud of that for some reason. 

Now, I'm ready. I have Lightroom installed and want to learn the basics (color adjustments, tonal curves etc.)

Are there some good tutorials about this? Books or something along the lines that give me an idea of what good processing is would be good as well!

I did check out r/Lightroom, but it's not active at all..

EDIT: Thanks a lot for all your suggestions! Lynda.com it is!! :) 




 Here are the facts. That's all I have the energy for right now:

1. I am a poor, unfunded graduate student.
2. My mom had a brain tumor 4 years back. She was getting better. Everyone (including the doctors) said she was the bravest patient they'd seen. She was the prime example of how a lifelong practice of Yoga helps someone get over the toughest obstacles. Then she got two more tumors in the spine and was paralyzed, immobilized, disoriented and delirious. Yoga could go fuck itself. God laughed in her face. Now show me what you've got, He said from the nothingness that he is. She's deteriorating every day, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.
3. My sister-in-law is pregnant. The baby was the answer to all our problems. Where if we looked one way at my mom, we would be unhappy thinking about the amazing woman she was, we would be happy looking at the baby, with all its potential for the future. The baby is now diagnosed with Down Syndrome.
4. I can't do anything for any of these people. All I can do is fly from one house to the other, spend a little time with them and get back to my own miserable existence, which involves whiskey, cigarettes and loneliness of the worst kind in large quantities.

I know I'll learn to deal with all of this in time. But what do I do today?

I have no one to talk to. Well, I do. But I don't want to trouble any of them.  Reddit, so I'm troubling you. I don't know why. I'm sorry.  




 I am in Portland for the next 2-3 weeks and was looking to buy a used bike. I looked at the co-op and everything they have is more than $350, which is more than I can afford.

Is there another good place to buy used (well, new as well) bikes? I am looking for something in the $200-300 range.
 




 I'm a grad student who's done most of his programming in Matlab and now, due to speed considerations on numerical simulations, have to program in C++.

I am familiar with syntax and some level of OOP concepts, but most of my C++ programming so far has been on Linux, where writing (in Vim) and compiling (g++) has never been an issue.

Now however, my laptop has Windows and I have no idea what to use to compile etc and would welcome suggestions. I do think Vim on windows looks ugly.

Eclipse seems cool, but seems like too much for me. Does anyone have anything to say about it?

What about QT creator? I seem to see only good things being said about it, but is it still worth considering if my program will not have a GUI?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the recommendations! Got even more useful information than I had expected! I am going to try Mex with MS Virtual Studio first and parallelly install Linux in parallel.   




 Oh come on. This doesn't answer anything. I think the teacher was completely right, though she could have attempted something, I guess.

Your answer begets 50 more questions, like what are series, how do we know they converge, which leads to sequences and the foundations of real analysis.

Answering those questions is exactly what college math is about, so the teacher was right, I would say. 









 Ah...That be making sense and I be standing corrected! 




 Isn't this a random, irrelevant statistic? Correlating two variables that really have nothing to do with each other?

They interviewed 5000 people, of which 5 % were LGBT. Which means the sample was really small.

And for how many of those people did being LGBT have anything to do with brand perception:

"I don't like iPhone because there are no widgets"
"Android is cool. It lets me tinker with settings"

I'm really not sure what to make of this article. Any ideas?

 




 Is there a decent app that plays Youtube links in the background? Either as video or as audio, since most of what I do on youtube is listen to music.

I tried harex, and Queuetube, but both of those are quite bad. Harex refuses to quit, and is a pain to get working. Queuetube stutters and stammers.

Is there a good app that does this? If it could give me a choice when I clicked on a youtube link, that would be awesome! 




 That looks perfect.. Thanks!  




 Reddit, 

My friend has a Motorola Droid Razr and it came preinstalled with Swype and new languages apparently can't be downloaded for preinstalled Swype.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a swiping keyboard that handles both French and English, preferably together or atleast allows you to change at the touch of a button?

I use Swiftkey 3, but for some reason it didn't work for her!
 




 No. I have the regular S2.. 




 Thansk! I did not know that! Any particular ROM you recommend / What ROM are you using?

This would be done through Odin right? 




 Really? :O AT T?

Mine said No updates available...And it lets me check only once a day.

That would be awesome! 




 I rented a one-way rental at night (midnight). The LEX was $90. The rental was $140 for a day. Gas was $25 or thereabouts.

So it's not cheaper by itself. But there were 3 of us, so it worked out cheaper for us. 




 Oh sorry. I have the AT T Galaxy S2...so SGH-i777 (assuming there's only one model number of AT T S2s) 




 So, I got a Galaxy S2 yesterday...

I had a Motorola Bravo till then, which was a cheap, slow but did-what-a-cheap-phone-should-do phone. The Galaxy (even though it seems like the S2 is behind the curve) is much, much faster, smoother and all that.

It has Gingerbread (2.3.7).

I tried rooting it yesterday. I rooted with a 2.3.4 zedomax kernel (only because that was the most popular result on Google) and my Wifi stopped working. I flashed a Shiyah kernel to fix it and then everything stopped working. After a very scary fifteen minutes, i unrooted to 2.3.4 and then upgraded back to 2.3.7.

So after 3 hours of meddling, I'm back to where I started.

I figure that my problems arose because I was using an outdated rooting guide.

What are people using to root the SGS2s these days? 

A link to a good XDA thread or a blogpost would be greatly appreciated. I can't differentiate between good and bad on XDA without help yet.

My main goal not the root, but ICS. I know I can install the ICS firmware directly. Has anyone tried that?  




 Oh yes, we passed by Gem lakes. We were supposed to camp ahead of there actually, but didn't make it in time!

It had snowed just before we got there...so there was quite a bit, but nothing unmanageable... 




 I didn't have any cold season wear. I had to borrow a pair of thin gloves from friends and wear socks over them! My layers were two layers of sweatshirts and one t-shirt underneath. Like I said, unprepared :D But even with my stupidity, it was manageable, except for the night, which was slightly uncomfortable.

Oh, and wear sunglasses! I didn't and had a very unpleasant encounter with snow blindness! 




 It was really cold at night, though more due to lack of preparation than the weather itself. 

And the fact that I kind of slipped into Long Lake and got my shoes completely soaked.

The climb was not cold at all. We were taking off layers as we got higher!  









 I'll be on the patio with 2-3 people. I have light blue polo shirt on. And I'll be there by 10 PM! 

I'm not sure either how to recognize people who get there before me! 




 It's happening... Meetup at Bling Pig (the brewery) at 10 PM for beer.

I'll be there at 10 PM! See you all there.

Despite all rumors and unintended insinuations to the contrary, undergrads are welcome! 




 Yes! 

I won't be here the Tuesday following this one, but will certainly make it every other Tuesday in the Summer! 




 Get them along too! 




 Either one? How about starting at the brewery? I haven't been there as much as the usual one. 




 I am sorry, I posted asking for a meetup and then promptly forgot about it!

How about Meeting Tuesday at Blind Pig for beer and talk?

EDIT: The brewery (for starters!) 




 Any other Grad students around? And interested in meeting for a beer or two or three? 

EDIT: We seem to have something here. How about Sunday night? I'll post details tomorrow. Also no hate for undergrads intended, all beer drinkers welcome :D

 









 Hello all,

My friends and I want to go backpacking over the long weekend. Any suggestions close to LA?

The only real constraint is that it shouldn't be too crowded.

Thanks!

EDIT: Wow...Thank you all for your suggestions...this is awesome! 




 Wow! Grad student going through exactly the same thing here! Wow... It's scary how much is the same in my life.

Well, I can't answer any of your questions, because I'm trying to find out myself. I can tell you it's really frustrating. It's been three years now (two with non-reciprocating soul mate) and nothing gets better.

We have hope. And cigarettes. 




 This kind of gets into the dirty details of things, but OPs explanation was only conceptual. The ONLY real interaction (that causes any sort of net transfer of energy) between the wings and the air is through friction, i.e. viscosity. No viscosity, no lift. 

The idea is Viscosity - Circulation - Lift. 

There is a net loss in momentum of the air and a net force on the wing (both lift and drag), i.e. Newton's Law. Yes, the air is deflected downwards in order to generate lift,

If you integrate the pressure over the entire surface of the wing, you get a net force, which can be split into lift and drag.

Also, "Air hitting the bottom surface" of the wing is just wrong. Imagine a flat plate with flow perpendicular to it. Air is hitting the bottom surface in all glory, but lift is infact zero (all the force is drag).

Aerodynamics researcher (PhD) and teacher of Senior Level Applied Aerodynamics. 




 Pedantic note: Faster air doesn't "lead" to static pressure. Low static pressure and high velocity are equivalent in a flow. One is not the cause of the other.

Lift is generated by circulation and circulation alone. Your explanation is kind of incorrect in the sense that it does not explain why lift would be zero in an inviscid flow.

 Wow... this is awesome. Here's what I said on another poem right here on this subreddit, today:

"I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more.
I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting.
We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach." 

Thanks!!!
