 I am fairly interested though.... Despite the 'sarcasm' surrounding it, I legitimately think its a pretty awesome movie. It's loveable and funny and I'd be thrilled to talk about it. 




 What the hell is wrong with you 




 Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson (How I Met Your Mother) 




 Gah, you ruined it. 




 Would have expected to see North Korea by now. Has a knack for poping up in 'worst places'. 




 And all this science, I don't understand 




 Pass the text book so we can puff up this-no I can't fix this, he's just a complete and utter stoner. 




 I honestly see absolutely no problem here. It's past 1, and you may have convinced me to go make a sandwich. 




 I figured no one cared. To be honest I'm a little surprised people still read that. But I guess if it brings some sort of closure to one person, hold on. 




 Oh boy, you caught me at a good time. So my dad has this thing that builds up a about a metric shit ton of air pressure. Its made for powering nail guns, but can be used for all sorts of things. They didn't really put a responsible limit on the machine because they didn't really put a respinsible limit on the wild number of attachments you could hook it up to. Theres one for blowing around pressurized air, one for power washing, you name it.

Anyhow, I was supposed to clean the front walk way today. My walkway is made up of a bunch of stones with no cement in between. Shit gets stuck in there and its almost impossible to get out. I was generously given the air cannon to cleanse those hard to reach cracks. It started out just fine. I pumped it up to a shit ton per square inch, and we were off. Everything was effortlessly coming out, no ammount of dirt and leaves could stand in my way! And then I got bored. I decided to crank the pressure up another half shit ton. I distinctly remember saying, "Let's see what this baby can do!" Oh, how I would regret those words.

I started aiming the little pressure gun thingy around my yard to see how far it reached. About 25 feet for those of you wondering. It was shaped kinda like a realish gun, so it was pretty fun. Suddenly someone shouted, "Hey!" *Shit!* I thought, *did someone just catch me really embarrassingly playing with fucking air?!* Accept I didn't even get those rational thoughts together. I just turned to face my accuser. Fun fact, sometimes when you're surprised your muscles tighten and tense up. This can be especially bad if you're holding anything dangerous, like, say an air cannon. Before I knew it, a shit ton and a half square inches of pressure hit my brother directly in the balls at point blank range. It very literally blew him away. I mean he had some decent hang time considering how many steps he had to go down. Unfortunately for him, he didn't even have the weeds in the cracks of the bricks to comfort his fall.

He just got back from the hospital and apparently were telling everyone he got hit by a base ball from a rouge pitching machine. Only me, him, my parents, my neighbors gardeners, the lovely doctors at Widmore Medical and my friends will know the truth. Oh, and now the internet I suppose. Shhh.

**TL;DR I hit my brother in the balls with an air gun pumped up to exactly one and a half shit tons per square inch of pressure. Recently released from hospital, no permanent injuries. If you don't count pride.** 




 What in the fucking fuck... 




 I'd have to see his study habits to really find the issue here. 




 Upvote for your time, sir. 




 Paul Blart. Paul fills the cracks in the heart. Go away pain.

 THERE BETTER NOT BE ANY MALL COP 2 SPOILERS HERE 




 Oscar nominations?* 




 A big fat upvote! Gracias, mi amigo. 




 No, this is /u/test_subject3655... 




 I actually spend a lot of time in Wisconsin, I was just in Milwaukee two weeks ago (complete coincidence, I still don't live there). One time I actually met Hulk Hogan in the Milwaukee airport, bandana and all. It was weird, we had a very normal conversation. At no point during our 13ish minute chat did he nor I acknowledge that he was a fairly famous celebrity. He just sat down next to me, asked me to pass the news paper, and we talked about the headlines for a while. So to answer your question, its pretty nice this time of year. 




 Yes, they absolutely did, but Halloween itself is a Christian holiday. Of course there were other influences. I guess I don't really see what your arguing here, Halloween is a Christian holiday just like Samhin was pagan. Historians today aren't really sure where Halloween itself originated, although there are many possibilities, Samhin among them.

Of course many Christian traditions come from other influence, whats your point though? Halloween is simply not celebrated in paganism, period. Nor any other religion. Hence 'completely Christian'.

EDIT: For the record, the term 'a completely Christian holiday' does not at all mean that there isn't other influence in it, nor does it imply it. 




 Yeah but...its fact. What is there to disagree with? And ambiguity of history? 




 Awww. Gracias, I'll fix it. 




 I canged it three times. Started with intents and purposes, changed it when someone said that was wrong, changed it back when I realized he was wrong. The first change was about two minutes in though, so no edit asterisk was added, the second edit was when I put in the EDIT. To be honest, I didn't see your comment until well after.  




 It doesn't change in quoted text...

Gotcha.

Try it.

I think the edit was the part with EDIT next to it. 




 Usually I skip straight to step two. I like to stay ahead of the game. 




 Reunion potentially revived? 




 Nope, [this one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33yg8j/what_are_some_unusual_things_your_parents/cqpm5jw) takes the cake. 




 Well no, not necessarily. That's definitely a possibility, but the origin of Halloween is still debated. Some think it was from Samhain, some think Pomona, or even Parentalia. No one really knows where it came from, but Halloween itself is a completely Christan holiday, regulardless of what holiday preceded and maybe even inspired it.

EDIT: Downvotes? I don't really mind, but why? 




 Although more of a commercial thing now, Halloween is 100% a Christian holiday. Its an evening of feasting to remember the dead (hence it's being called the day of the dead in places like Mexico), particularly dead saints (hallows). Costumes and fun was a way to approach the sad topic of death more lightly. And the 'scary' aspect of Halloween come from farmers and people dressing up to scare evil spirits away from their harvest. The entire holiday is essentially Christian though... If I were you I would tell them about it, just to see what they thought. 




 Thats so sad, some of my favorite memories are playing outside with neighborhood kids :( 




 Were you an only child? I feel like this couldn't even be enforced any other way. 




 Fucking fuck you... I don't even know what that is, I noped out after the word 'urethral'. The picture didn't help either. 




 'Picture' isn't capitalized...I think he means the portrait... 




 I had a dog like that... We named him 'Gord' because he eventually started responding to the term, "Oh, good lord!" 




 Woah, I think I heard that one go flying over your head 




 Well I really love anything Kevin Spacey does, but I gotta say House of Cards is a step above the rest. 




 I know a few people who didn't touch alcohol until they were 21. Props to them for that kind of self control, but its really embarrassing for a 21 year old to walk into a bar, try their first drink, and gag out of complete disgust. Before you go out for a big bash on your 21st birthday, maybe test the waters in the shallow end.

EDIT: I realize how few people this applies to, I mean thats an ungodly amount of self control, but this is for the good kids don't deserve embarrassment like that. 




 Not really, they just didn't get along together at all. They were both really nice to everyone else. 




 Yeah pretty much, I don't live in Wisconsin.

EDIT: A lot of people seem pretty disappointed with no Reddit reunion, so for all intents and purposes, I totally live in Wisconsin. 




 sigh*

EDIT: I think my name takes the cake on this one. The name comes from when I was trying to come up with a username and they were all taken. A friend of mine said, "just stop, man" and what do you know, it worked. Little did I know 'stop man' is some sort of Japanese anime porn comic. [I found out the hard way] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tra31/whats_the_biggest_secret_you_would_share_without/co1s2h8?context=3). Anyhow, I guess thats what I'd be into. 




 In middle school, the quiet kid, Steven, had an arch rival. Robbie. In class Robbie always seemed to come out on top of their little scuffles, mostly because Steven couldn't really formulate or execute a 'burn' or 'comeback'. He just rolled over and let Robbie get his insults in until the teacher stepped in. One day I was walking behind Robbie after that class and Steven quietly crept up behind him. Before Robbie could even turn around, he got as close as possible and said, "If I was to come into your house and kill you while you were sleeping, I doubt anyone would even notice..." then he disappeared into the darkness of the science hallway. I don't remember the exact words, but the was pretty damn close. I was about 55% shocked, 30% laughing hysterically on the inside, and 15% terrified. Robbie never made fun of ol' Stevie again.

EDIT: Yippie, new top comment! Thanks, Reddit :) 




 I once won one (once won one...woah) of a those huge arcade prizes at the amusement park. Never have I been able to return to the same level of stardom. 




 "My anaconda *does* want some" 




 Everything about that fucking sucks. 




 Kinda thought [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TQQGqQtnBk) was the kind of thing I was looking at. 




 Uh oh 




 Um, incredible? ...Its a tunnel. I mean it looks very cool, and I totally want to drive a boat over that little boat-bridge, but its just a tunnel. 




 Holy mother of god, no one is safe! 




 Every season the first four games are just horrible, then they get it together later by around week 5. I need to explain this concept to all of my non-Patriot fan friands literally every year. And I get to explain it again every December :D 




 Is it somewhere behind that pipe? 




 [27%?! Gosh, people are so gullible.] (http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1553645/funny-gif-Steve-Carell-laughing.gif) 




 What? I wrote that example that way intentionally, changing it doesn't make any sense. And regardless, thats an example, the point still stands. His way was kind of wrong. 




 That had some of the best reactions I've ever seen. Yellow-blue jacket guy, beige jacket man and cool-blue-sunglasses-dude are among my favorites. 




 Gasp* "Where on Earth did you learn a word like that?!"

"Uh, our dishes?" 




 I would just start the books, if you're waiting for Winds of Winter you'll be starting in 2017. The books are pretty long too, you might not be done by the time it comes around! 




 Letter that was promised?

 One of the best smelling strains ive seen

Thats kinda like saying, "one of the best tasting dinners I've heard" 




 I'm a decent writer, or at least I like to think I am. I've been published a few times (mostly magazine articles, nothing too major) and very often wrire short stories just for fun. I can't promise I would be that big of an asset, but if you want me take a look at what you wrote and give you my two cents, I'd be happy to help! 




 Do NOT try to read this at a [9]... You know when you're mind starts to wander while you're reading but you're eyes keep moving down the words like you're actually reading them? Well I was reading this when I decided in my head I should imagine Obama saying this like he would have on the TV show, and that made me think of my friend who can do an awesome Obama impression, and then I thought of this guy on Americas Got Talent who does really cool impressions, which lead to thinking about Howie Mandels goatee for a while, and then I thought maybe I should grow a goatee, and then I was like, "Hey, King Tut has a pretty kick ass goatee", (for some reason I said that part out loud) and that went on for a while and I came to the conclusion that King Tut and Howie Mandel would probably be really good friends, a thought which developed into a TV show staring the two ('Howie and the Tut'), a sitcom about two dysfunctional, fun loving room mates living in suburban Giza. And then I guess I read the name 'Obama' and it must have registered in my brain because suddenly Obama was in the show, and he was like the guy in the gang that no one really likes but hes still always kinda around (not necessarily unlike normal Obama) and they all went on all kinds of adventures together, like white water rafting down the Nile, and pulling pranks on ol' Vlad Putin (as I imagine Obama does in real life). And then realized that I been reading the same line over and over again for literally eleven minutes.

It was a wild ride. 




 Thanks, man. 




 4 would already be pretty fucking big... 




 Me: "...wait why isn't he starting till 4:20? Thats late, the sun will almost even be going down." 




 I know less now than I did before. 




 Welp, thanks for ruining the memory of Robin Williams. 




 Someone please explain this to me in detail so I don't have to click for myself. I really hope no one sees my inbox when I log back on... 




 Thats only $10 more dude. 




 What time zone do you live in in Europe? We can just do some simple math here. 




 Never not upvote this

I got a second opinion as this is not my first language. I might have maybe forgot there was such a thing as a double negative, but lets not dwell on that. Small words used in quick succession occasionally confuse me sometimes... 




 It was the right choice against the wrong team. Think about it, the Seahawks had three downs, one timeout and lass than a minute to go one yard. The best game plan here is to throw it on second
 down, then if it's incomplete run it on third, if that fails use your last time out and run again on fourth. It might have been a better idea to throw it on third instead of second, but regardless the throwing was not the problem. As a coordinator or a coach you do not account for things like interceptions or fumbles. Sure you expect them once or twice over the course of a game (three or four times if your Rex Ryan) but you don't avoid choosing a play because you think the other team is going to come up with a miraculous play. Not only that, but as good as Marshawn Lynch is, he is NOT good at running from the one yard line. In fact, he's pretty bad at it. I'll direct you [here] (http://mobile.sportingnews.com/article/4634710-nfl-super-bowl-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-one-yard-line-analysis-context-pete-carroll-call-patriots-2014). His swooping left and right with bursts of speed doesn't work from the one yard line when an entire team is running at you down the entire line. Pete Carol and his offense made the right decision, the Patriots were just in the right place at the right time.

Theres no guarantee the game would have been over after that either. Who in the right mind doesn't think Tom Brady can't get a field goal (which is all they would have needed to tie) with a minute left? Especially considering how well Tom Brady was playing that night. 




 I don't think you understand, that was a glorious moment in Patriots history. Richard Sherman, the very man who disrespected Tom Brady with his "You mad, bro?", finally got what was coming to him: agonizing defeat in the form of Malcom Butler. I have nothing against the Seahawks, Russell Wilson seems like a great guy, Marshawn Lynch is hilariously unconventional, and I'm a huge USC fan so Pete Carol is and will always be a hero in my eyes. That being said, seeing the cocky sparkle in the eyes of Richard Sherman die a little bit at that exact moment was literally the most satisfying thing I have ever seen. 




 "Yeah, sure, but fuck that guy"

No, but seriously if you think they might be dating someone, approach the topic very casually, so that just in case they do its no big deal. It also might be a good idea to go into it fully expecting that they do in fact already have an SO. Then you get to play the other role, acting surprised if they don't or cool and collected if they do. Kind of just something like, "Really? Awesome!" if they don't or, "Yeah, I kinda thought someone like you probably would" if they do. Its tough to give exact examples or recommendations though because you really have to read the situation, but I think you get the point. Good luck! 




 He pulled this one out of the bag a few times this year. Where he drops back and when the pocket starts collapsing runs through it up to the line of scrimmage and guns it on the fly. I've never seen it from him in any other season, but its fucking awesome! 




 The consumers of the North Korean economy will surely rejoice! Well, they would if I hadn't just made them up. 




 Ohhhhhhhh, I get it! Took me a while, but I'm here now! 




 I dont get it 




 You forgot Independence Day, Fantastic Four, X-Files, Terminator and Half Life 3! Oh wait. 




 Tomorrow you definitely gotta come back and log your adventure. I patiently await the epic saga! 




 The worst way ever.

FTFY 




 Good for you, I'm 27. Too bad you clicked at 52 though, huh?

EDIT: Can you see it now?... Not purple, not sure why its not showing. 




 He was also in 'The Wedding Ringer' where he dropped another reference. At the end they all get on a plane and he suddenly looks all dramatic amd serious and says, "I've got a bad feeling about this flight..." Last line of the movie. 




 Yeah, I guess it could also be argued that he killed Tricia Tanaka... 




 Hurley! Wait, he hit someone with a car. Did they die? Nah, he's Hurley. 




 Ah, the fabled Cockamouse. Half cockroach, half mouse. It's about the size of a potatoe, it has antennae, a hard exoskeleton, fur whiskers and the ability to fly. It primarily inhabits apartments and hotels on the lower east side of Manhattan, but has been sighted as far away as the subarbs of New York City. As of right now, there are an unknown number of wild Cockamice, although one was known to have recently given birth. 




 Confirm or deny OP, confirm or deny. 




 Me and some friends once smoked in a big park near my town. We went down a trail and found a good spot. The park closes when its dark so after a while we got everything together and headed out. It got dark a lot faster than I had expected though, and pretty soon the trees made it completely dark (the not-quite-as-awesome kind of trees). To make matters worse, we couldn't find the way back. I had been there pleanty of times before, but for some reason I couldn't find the right trail. We went in the same circle three times. Yeah, I know, but it was terrifying. At one point ome of my friends got way ahead of us and wouldn't slow down. He was gone eventually. We finally made it out and got a call from the guy who went ahead saying he was waiting by the gate to make sure they didn't lock it while we were still in the park. We finally got out and parked close outside the park. I thought we were home clear but apparently not. A park ranger pulled us over when we were leaving and questioned the hell out of us. Almost worse than I would imagine a cop. He totally knew, and would have definitely called the cops if he could prove it. He followed us for a while too. We were in two separate cars, so we went different directions and lost him, but it was still scary as hell. 




 ...and?? 




 Pavers? Good to know! Theirs looks like [this] (http://www.resourcedir.directory/images-uploads/2014/02/08/arbel-paver-patio-landscape-pavers-design-and-installation.jpg), it really is just about as beautiful as a drive way can get. And no I'm not the least bit stoned...lol I guess I'm just really passionate about drive ways. 




 [This] (http://www.amazon.com/RAW-Natural-Unrefined-Rolling-Papers/dp/B0064DWDZM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1428972170 sr=8-2 keywords=rolling+cones) will make life easier. I just got like 400. Also, /r/casualconversations is good for stuff like this! I think. I'm not really sure, I subscribed like two days ago, but give it a shot non the less! Good luck:D 




 Nice, but the octopus above your TV really stole the show for me. That thing is fantastic. 




 Joke or did you light that up?

EDIT: Downvote? I'm totally serious. I've seen both on this sub. 




 "My, what strong edibles you have!"

"All the better to get baked with, my dear!"

All I could think of for some reason. Please don't judge me... 




 Good lord, please don't sneeze OP. 




 This would give me the same exact dilemma as my neighbors drive way. I know, let me explain. You see, they have no ordinary drive way, no sir. Its made up of individual stones meticulously fit together without cement like some sort of road mosaic. It looks incredible. Every time I see it I'm like, "Damn, I couldn't drive over a piece of art like that!". Same concept with the ashtray. Good job, OP! 




 As a supporter of legalization, I hope not. As a recent watcher of 'Thank You for Smoking', I would love to see a sequel. 




 At first glance I thought that said "on the outskirts of Saint Louis, Colorado". I first questioned my historical prowess, then my knowledge of geography, then I read it again. 




 The pond is behind you, genius. 




 For those of you wondering, yes this is exactly what you think it is, no you should not open it if in public. Someone should probably throw a NSFW on there too. 




 I only say this because I'm sure that not everyone did, but you MUST watch the video. It's amazing. [Link] (https://youtu.be/qkpWwnNiGgE) for lazy people who use hyperzoom (like me). 




 Whats that? 




 That would be one hell of a box cutter.
