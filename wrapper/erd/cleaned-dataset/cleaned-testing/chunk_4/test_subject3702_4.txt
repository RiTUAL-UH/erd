 It's not about sentence structure, it's using the correct words and grammar. Which to me is very important.

Saying "hung" instead of "hanged," to me at least, is like saying "brung" instead of "brought." 




  Edit: People are comparing drinking breast milk to cannibalism?!

that's because people here are retarded with a false sense of logic. 

MOST BABIES ARE CANNIBALS RAHRAHRAH!!!  




 I think I'm pregnant 




 oh woah! I always wondered what those were when I was a kid. An older kid told me they were scorpians. 




  it's not art

It's a bold statement to make. It has been made about many things that we now revere. I don't want to get into an argument about it or anything, it's just a nice sentiment about being human... You are making a universal claim, and it holds true right now. I mean, it really does for the most part. But who knows, couple years down the line and "OppoQuinn, you're just like the people who didn't want robots to have equal rights! God! I HATE YOU!" 




 an honest question:

Why do you want to pay for something that should be learned through hard work on your behalf? There are many free -- not in the sense of dumbed down articles and tutorials -- resources on the web and in books (not actually free). 

The reason I ask is because I'm just assuming that you do not trust the reputation of free information, but realize that I could be wrong.

Seriously though, if you're looking for a way to learn web design my best advice would be to not pay for it with money! Work on building a portfolio of work that you have invested your hard work and time, which in the end is much more valuable. No paid courses are necessarily going to get you there faster. Just tinker, receive criticism, and tinker more.

 That's just good advertisement for his sister! 




 I too learned that things that are different have no similarities.  




 You know, my drivers Ed was taught by some dreadlocked hippie that had a drum circle session during break (I went to the week long drivers Ed with five hour classes). that guy had some pretty down to earth things to say about driving. 




 Seriously.  




 just sounds like a bunch of drug addicts doing science. 




 I just always think to myself "de - finite - ly" 









 The cylons plucked it out and threw it on to the floor, picked it up and showed it to me... Looked like a hard boiled egg. 




 I believe you are looking for this: http://boards.4chan.org/b/ 




 Unlike booze, of course. 




 Basically wondering if there is a common pictorial image for Sol and the planets surrounding it... 




 Now this is one of the really tough questions. The reason is because "the greater good" is really loosely defined. It could mean simply "the greatest amount of people unharmed", it could be used to imply some sort of "universalize goodness," or perhaps other more specific definitions for deciphering the greatest good, beliefs of what that is, and what is actually happening in reality.

There is no real answer, of course. Unless you believe in some sort of system of truth that exists independently of the world. 




 Well, the PNW, and especially Portland takes a special kind of pride in their Spanish coffees... There is so much booze in those things that I'm definitely on the way after one. 




 Was it as shitty as people try to tell me? 




 I frequently bring my computer to a bar and drink a Spanish coffee while working. 




 Ah, damn. Yeah, it is really surprising how expensive those  bastards are... I just bought a desk and a chair and the fucking chair was almost as expensive as the desk.  




 ...can you just buy a chair for yourself? Or is that not allowed either? 




 I like the way they do things in France. 




 I too saw this on criminal minds. 




 babe 




 I said out loud to my self, "that's amazing!"

and I've already seen the reich roll 




 No. Due to certain quantum factors, there is a 50/50 chance that the toast will land face down on either side that is buttered. 

In order for toast to levitate, you need to refrain from buttering either side. Because of the same quantum factors as above, there is an inverse property which causes the chances of it landing face down to become -50%, or in other words, floating. 




 this sounds like a /r/shittyaskscience question to me 




 Occasionally? 




 Aww you are just adorable 




 you're a cheeky little cunt, aren't you? 




 Well no shit. Thank you! No seriously, thank you. I thought that that was simply a universal rule for everybody that had money. I'm terribly happy that you cleared that up for me..

You fucking ass hat.  




 *all* of them, HIV_butts 




 the man *made* a million dollars 




 This is really awesome! Thank you so much, would love to see more! 




 because it looks pretty cool? Why does there have to be a why? 




 are you kidding me? this was on the front page like a month ago 




 You were just born in the wrong time. 




 what is this? 




 Hey man, I'm not on any diets here. I just ate a whole pizza and am currently working through a six pack. Just commenting on a general trend of Reddit... 

Now, It's clear that you're not a fan of low carb diets. Great! I personally don't give a fuck.  




 because this is reddit, where people hate everything you say. 




 Nonono... You've got it all wrong. I enjoyed the movie. If you cannot stand a single piece of criticism of a movie you liked, then such is reddit I guess... 




 exactly. I re-watched this last year, and before that I saw it when I was a freshman or so... It absolutely scared the shit out of me back then, but when I watched it last year I realized how fucking brilliant it is. 




 You know, I really did enjoy the movie... There was just something irritating about it being high school students doing everything. I just kept saying "this fucking kid is in high school."

 *illusion* 




 Aww, You started out so great. 




 You go up to the bartender and say, "buy mike a shot of rumple minze on me."

It sounds foolish, but quickly turns into a hilarious game of getting fucked up.  




 Yeah man, but the service industry has a tendency of smashing dreams on the floor and rubbing your face in the broken pieces. It's excellent money, I know!  




 It's become somewhat of a prank at the place I work to "rumple" someone.  




 If you're in the pacific north west, order a Spanish Coffee with Stroh Rum. That'll get you going. 




 ah, first time there? hmmm... It's... It's, well.. you know. fifthworldpics, bro! 




 reddit is getting people killed?
 




 Really great design! 




 Precisely 




 I hope nobody dies, but either way I'll watch the video 




  This made us kinda stand back because it was weird and he looked like he was having a fit or something. 

I fucking lost it! 




 sources! sources both of you! 




 grade A comedy right here 




 "Jeremy, what is Super Hans doing?" 




 Now you need a great dough recipe! 




 Apparently, when I was too young to remember, I used to throw tantrums in public quite frequently. My mother, frustrated to a point of insanity at this, got down and threw herself a tantrum in front of me. She said that I was so embarrassed/confused that I never had another. 




 I laughed at the first one, and laughed harder at this second one 




 Did you live in the handy house? 




 I upvoted this for the truth it contains, but it at least deserves a minor correction, because both support URL citations. 




 The next time this concerns you, include one less jpeg 




 ok. don't be too specific, but where *abouts* do you live? I will give you tips depending. 




 dude, it has been in my experience that the pacific north west is full of bad drivers. as a fellow bostonian, you know that that's saying a lot. 




 wait*a*minute! 




 THANK YOU! 




 I prefer Octopodes, and I will never let that go.

 I wasn't trying to argue with him. I was just pointing out that his remarks sounded like something a child would say.

But I have an honest question for you. How old are you? Please don't think I'm looking to make an ageist argument here, I'm just curious. I'm 25, and have been out of college for a little while now. And the one thing I regret is not spending more time focused on studies. I honestly think that I was too immature to start my studies in the first place. And I guess my point is this,

College helped me grow up. It allowed me to become independent, get lots of new interests, learn romantic relationships, make big mistakes (and recover from them), etc.

I think it's very important to acquire this kind of culture, and it's almost tragic that collage/university study has become the medium for which most kids in the US go about getting them.

Being truly self sufficient and supporting yourself financially is when these lessons really happen. College should be about improving upon whatever skill set you desire to improve on, so that you are more prepared when real life happens.  

 




 haha! you sound like a child. An entitled, shitty little child. 
there's more to school than learning
 




 so it's like this. You shouldn't believe a random internet stranger, I don't blame you, I wouldn't either. But I work at a bar, and Isaac comes in to the bar quite frequently. We have after hours, and the band hangs there sometimes. I've been here for quite some time, and know him personally. He's never been on the wagon. 




 your lack of paragrapgs gave me cancer. 




 eh. I'm a short white dude, and I lived in a studio for a while in Brockton. It's just like any other shitty city, bad and good parts. 




 you were afraid? 




 I recently watched it and told everybody to see it. It's an excellent movie! 




 you are right. excellent was a poor choice of words. funny is a bit more on point.  




 Hahaha, what an excellent saying 




 Why are you redefining your sl? 




 Yeah, I remember getting very, very good at divining this answer. 




 This is truly a great thing. I am, time and time again, baffled at the rising ignorance on this site. You are doing good for the people, keep it up!
