 Think you found the worst quality version of this gif as possible. 




 Wow you can really see the added support to the canadian trailer which helps significantly better, they just need to add those to the outer edges and would be beneficial to anyone that rear ends an 18 wheeler. 




 you dropped this \\

 This is true, i guess a major spoiler can be tagged as such. 




 Yes, exactly that one. I've only been to lagoon half dozen times growing up. They all were themed for ww1 i believe and there was one that was the red baron IIRC. Live out of state but often spent the summers with my cousins. That ride inspired me to become a pilot, i will one day. 




 This was before i found reddit and now i'm stuck here reading shit comments. Never ending cycle. 




 Fucking lagoon, haven't been there in ages. Is the airplane swing still there? 




 Do we still need to tag spoilers still? The series has been over for a while now. I'm sure everyone that has wanted to see it has by now.
