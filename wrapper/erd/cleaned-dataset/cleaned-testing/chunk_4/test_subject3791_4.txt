 Hello. I have a [Asrock Z97 Extreme4](http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/) mobo and want to upgrade my system with a sound card, the [Xonar DGX](http://www.asus.com/Sound_Cards_and_DigitaltoAnalog_Converters/Xonar_DGX/). Just want to verify, is this PCIe card compatible with my motherboard?

[This is a photo of my motherboard](http://content.hwigroup.net/images/products/xl/217818/asrock_z97_extreme4.jpg).  Which slot should i use for that card?

Thanks in advance! 




 Companies that focus to the multiplayer side of a game and downgrade single to a "get ready for the multiplayer" experience are also hurting gaming.

And no one seems to make a buzz about it.. 




 Because some people think that paying for something means that it's good.

 Tough question. I think that it's [The Cell](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209958/) for me. 




 That's a nice furniture. What a bargain.

 Two things: photography and cinematography. I really like to photograph landscapes, but unfortunately there aren't many great things to photograph where i live and i don't have the means or the time to travel elsewhere right now.

Also, i really hope that one day i will manage to spend the time needed in order to learn how to play the guitar. 




  We have been made aware of an issue where the displays on a limited number of Lumia 930 units are exhibiting discolourations. This phenomenon is due to the performance of the display in certain brightness conditions. However, **we have identified the root cause** **and are currently working on a software update that will deliver improvements.**

Great news i guess :).

**EDIT**: [This is now on WPCentral](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes), with a bunch of comments. That's good, this issue needs more visibility, Microsoft should fix these screens ASAP or replace faulty devices (a recall maybe?).

 Nothing. Damn it. 




 Time flies 




 Does God exist? 




 From what i understand, there are two similar problems: the one is a purple tint that occurs even on black menus (i don't have this, and i think that this is software related and already fixed). The other one is mine, with gradient on white/gray backgrounds, and i believe that it's hardware related (purple tint AMOLED are a common defect. Had similar problems with my Galaxy Nexus).

What country does your 930 originates from? I have installed another firmware (from Finland) in order to get the Denim, but that didn't fix it. 




 Yes, i played a lot with this (and with brightness). I can change the purple tint to a more bluish one, but the gradient remains on white/gray backgrounds. If i set it on green, the right side becomes too green.

I'm using the Denim update. 




 Phone is updated with Denim, it's not fixed. 




 They got tired 




 Man, you ask for gold, you get gold. Wish I was that lucky. 




 Got a 930. I'm disappointed with the screen (it has a purple tint and a gradient on white/gray backgrounds). Service says that everything is normal, but I guess I'll try again with them. But good phone overall. 




 Anyone from Tauranga, New Zealand? You're so far away from me (17,607 km). I'm from Athens, Greece. 




 Al Pacino. The one and only. I think that Carlito's Way put him on that spot for me.

Also Edward Norton, due to 25th hour. Although he is fading away for me.

 ['The Interview' Premiere: Seth Rogen Thanks Amy Pascal "For Having The Balls to Make This Movie"](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/interview-premiere-seth-rogen-thanks-756765)

So.... 




 Yes i have. Screen sensitivity is on normal. 




 Hello. I decided to pass the [speaker "problem"](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2o91qy/lumia_930_speaker_problem/) on my Lumia 930, but now i'm observing something else, which was there from the beginning:

When i scroll through the app list or some other list (marketplace apps, settings menus and also Internet Explorer) there seems to be an instant "jump" when i pull my finger from the screen, which moves me further down (or up, depending on the direction i was scrolling) a bit on that list.

This doesn't happen every time and sometimes it needs a lot of trying to reproduce it. It's more evident on apps list and settings menu. I can't reproduce it on apps like Here maps, Nextgen Reader, Zedge, Lastpass, Fresh Paint, when viewing a photo or on some touch screen tests.

I disabled double tap to wake and to zoom and set screen sensitivity to normal, but that doesn't help. It seems like a Windows Phone problem rather that hardware.

Ideas? 




 It's sometimes for me also. The (less audible) hiss is every time, the pop/click is with more specific sounds.

So i guess that's the way it is.  




 So, no hiss on yours? 




 Hello. I bought a new Lumia 930. So far, i'm quite impressed with the phone. The only drawbacks seems to be the battery (which could have been better) and the speaker on the back.

The speaker is my main concern for now.  The problem is that, after every sound, it makes a bearably noticeable hiss for 4-5 sec and then (with most sounds) a click/pop (which, in a relatively quite environment, is quite obvious). That hiss is there even on apps like Nokia Camera, continuously. Also, on some notification sounds, there are 2-3 clicks just before the end (but can't hear them on music or other sounds).

I have found many references to this problem (px [here](http://forums.windowscentral.com/nokia-lumia-930/322329-nokia-930-speaker-hiss.html)) but no solution, workaround or someone that gave his device for service and they fix it. Many people say that it's a known problem with Lumia's, and it's something that occurred after WP 8/8.1 (and i have the latest updates).

My Lumia is eligible for DOA, but it's something that will take 10-15 days, since the store has to send the device to the authorized service in order to certify that it needs replacement - yes, i know, shitty service. I'm from Greece.

So, i was wondering: is this a hardware or a software problem? Is it a problem (so they are going to replace my device) or i'll spend 15 days with no smartphone just to get another one (or just the same) that has the same problem?

Thanks in advance!

 Yes, probably, but i'm not sure. Any source validating that there's sapphire on that lens? 




 It may get a little hotter. It was one of my concerns before buying. From what i have heard, it gets better over time. Bear in mind that many of the latest high-end phones have these issues. For example, LG G3 is like holding the sun.

EDIT: Also, many Xperias have overheating issues. 




 So, yes, yes you can. My Google calendars are available and i can add events to them. 




 Yeap, no comparison between 520 and 930. Even 735 felt luggish to me. 




 I'll check and get back to you :-) 




 I bought a Lumia after my Nexus 5 broke down. Nexus 7 is still going to be around as a tablet, mostly due to its great battery and big screen. But, as a smartphone and for daily usage, Lumia is going to be there :-). 




 I'm always extra careful with the camera lens on the back ;). 




 Thank you :).

(Nothing, just the light in the room hitting the bezel of the screen in an interesting way :p).

(and sorry for the bad photo quality from my Nexus 7...) 









 Man, i'm one step before buying Lumia 930. I just can't decide if i want to spend the extra 150 euro and buy 930 and not 735 (which costs 200 euro).  




 I was wondering: does the Lumia 735 suffer from overheat? 




 Thanks, so i guess the hue is not a problem. What about the reports of overheat? Is this happening a lot under normal use? 




 That's interesting. Maybe he did the review with a bad device or something.

Are you using a Lumia Icon or a Lumia 930?

EDIT: I see, thanks! 




 So, this is not happening on yours?

http://youtu.be/JYV2U5kuGBM?t=2m3s 




 Quick question for the owners of the Lumia 930: what do you think about the viewing angles of the screen? I saw on a video review (i think it was from Phonedog) that colors tend to fade easily, from very small angles. Is it true? Is that screen that bad?

 i went to 2-3 big local stores and i couldn't find a Lumia 930 to examine it myself. In truth, there were very few to none Lumia (they tend to promote Samsung and Apple).

EDIT: Here, i found it: http://youtu.be/JYV2U5kuGBM?t=2m3s 




 There are many apps that i'm counting on in Android, but i don't think there's anything that i'm not able to find an alternative for in WP right now. I'm not closed mind or a fanboy of any company or OS and Windows Phone is definitively a choice for me.

My price ceiling is definitely around ~200 euros. it's the specs that matters for me right now. 




 That's it's price here in Greece too. And yes, 735 is something i'm considering. Problem is that, if i finally manage to spend 200 euros, i'm not really sure if i want to get a Lumia 735 or go with Android and a Moto G 2nd gen (same price).

Windows Phone is a great choice for me for low-cost smartphones 100-150 euros), but i'm not really sure for something more pricey. 




 Cosmote and Vodafone has, my carrier (Wind) doesn't currently provide 4G. Don't really care about that, it wouldn't change my mind about what to buy. But i guess it's an extra point, in case i decide to change providers and use LTE. 




 I'm not considering 520 that much, just as a super-budget option for now, in case i decide to go with something extra cheap for now and get something better in 5-6 months.

I'm more between Lumia 535, 635 and 735. Lumia 535 has the downside of "coming soon" in Greece (don't really know how soon) and i need to get a smartphone in the coming week. And Lumia 735 is a little costly for me (200 euros), i don't know if it worths it. 




 That Snapdragon 200 is a big downside, compared to a Snapdragon 400...

 **JFK**

From Oliver Stone's golden era. Having recently watched **Born on the fourth of July**, i really miss that Oliver Stone. Going to watch **Nixon** in the next few days.

My second favorite movie of this week must be **Remains of the day**.

Yes, during the last weeks, i'm in the mood of watching old (or very old) movies that - for one reason or another - haven't watch until now. I have really missed some gems. 




 The line looks good :-) 




 Good choice, already played that :-) 




 Gaming is getting too much fantasy based (guess that's what sells more to a Lord of the rings/harry potter generation), but I'm not a fan of fighting dragons and warriors on the latest massively multiplayer RPG. So, I'm interested on your best picks of pc games that have a real world story, characters and setup (even if they get to extraordinary levels, like grand theft auto).

Thanks! 




 Put your music and your new album on **SPOTIFY**. That's another way to **LEGALLY** listen to it. It's 2014, internet is not an enemy, music must be accessible.

Any plans on that? 




 On DVD, it was Pearl Harbor. Boy, when i got it from the local rental store, I was feeling like I've been transfered to the future. And sorry for those renting VHS. And when i watched it on my computer, that was amazing. But a shitty movie. 




 Sounds interesting, thanks! 




 Thanks, that clarifies it. So, are there private screenings of the movies for these groups, or everyone gets a copy for personal viewing (like film critics do) and then submits a rating? And if so, isn't there a possibility that those people leak movies online? 




 So, if I understand correctly,13 people manage to watch every movie released in the USA? 




 Yes,I know about MPAA etc. My question is about the people that rate. Do they exist and do they really watch everything? Or its a semi automatic/by the book process, without viewing the actual movie? And if they watch and judge everything, how many judges are there? 









 I saw Titanic (1997) on a relatively small cinema. The Titanic movie was like a happening, everyone had to see it. So I remember it vividly, since it was a special day, many of my friends were there.  I was 12.

 Hello. Which is the best free web service for conducting polls via Twitter? I need something that users vote via clicking on links inside a tweet (for example click a link to vote "yes" or another link to vote "no"). Thanks! 
































































 Token limit... what a silly rule... 


































 To clear it up, [here is the full text](http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_trackers/transcript?language=en#t-343768) from the TED talk:

 Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it, install it in Firefox, to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

Nick Bradbury [said something similar](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/girls-around-me-shows-why-privacy-shouldnt-be-an-option.html). As he explains:

 Privacy - like security - **should be expected, not something that users have to enable**.

In other words, privacy must **be a de facto thing**, not something you have to choose/enable/look for. It's not an option, it's a right, it's a fact. It's like peace, health etc.
