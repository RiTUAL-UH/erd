 I was just jokin' around dude, didn't mean for you to take it seriously. 




 Yup 




 It's pronounced Barometer, Jerry!

(I know it's the other way around) 




 Everyone has their own preferences.... 




 It won't. IIRC, Interstellar was filmed in 70mm, and it looked fine. 




 A /s might help communicate your point a little better, but it's still not hilariously funny.  




 It's *not* Star Wars The Force Awakens? 




 Huh, I had no idea. 




 Not ID Forever Part I? 




 Larry David never fails to make me laugh 




 I usually do Plinkett, then the 101 Wacky Jokes for Kids to prove that Plinkett's voice isn't actually like that, then Half in the Bag 




 I would think it was because it might cause confusion among people who saw Luke lose his blue lightsaber 




 DAE I know what u talking about rlm rite??????????????????? ayy lmao 




 I guess they didn't color it right for the trailer 




 It seems like Star Wars and Marvel are being saved for D23, and that's only a month later.  




 It's the percent of critics that liked it, not the actual rating of the film. I have no idea why Sharknado is at 82%, but you shouldn't say critics opinions are irrelevant because of it. 




 ? 




 Not his question.

 I wouldn't think so... 




 Darth Plagueis was Palpatine's master, as mentioned in Episode 3 




 Yes, because YouTube was so popular and different in the two years that it was around before Google bought it?

Google has owned YouTube for 9 years, a pretty significant portion of its lifetime. Not much has changed to drastically alter your viewing experience.

And by the way, it's not Googles fault for having to follow the law and take down clips that movie studios don't want on YouTube... 









 Notice anything...?

 I honestly felt that it was closest in style and tone to the OT. 




 Spielberg makes movies like that for any age - legitimately great storytelling 




 Mm... Maybe not as talked about in today's world, but by no means underrated. Fantastic reviews, good box office results, several Oscar nominations... 




 Steven Spielberg 









 Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (has a 6.1, but close enough!) I think that this is a legitimately good movie, with some good performances and underlying messages. 




 Each to his own, I guess, but no reason to call me a dweebo. I like Star Trek just as much, just so you know. 




 That's *Caitlyn* Fett now 




 Yeah 




 No, this is a well known fact that's true 




 I would agree, if it wasn't for movies like Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel 




 I wouldn't say boring. Maybe emotionless, but they looked cool  (IMO) 




 Sure they have a lot in common, but no one should try to point out which one is better than the other, cause there's really not an answer to that. 




 Missed a couple of lines there! 




 Met Jar Jar and Boss Nass... 




 They locked the door and tried to kill us 




 Star Wars all the way  




 Yup, all those hundreds of millions of dweebos. Complete idiots for liking a simple story with fun ideas and relatable characters. Morons.

/s 




 But it's almost like comparing boats and cars. One might be used more often, and they're both methods of transportation but they're used for two different things. 




 Alright, I guess I agree with that. 




 Well, it's kind of an obscure movie to put fake casting details on, especially ones that seem realistic. 




 I disagree. I don't think Star Wars is only an action movie, it has a lot of relatable human elements and themes, and is genuinely a well told story. 

Wars and Trek are about two different things, and I really don't think it's right to compare them. 




 No. No one does that. Crazy people do that. 




 That's gold, Jerry, GOLD! 




 Not just to me, but to many critics and movie goers alike. Look at the AFI top 100 movies, or the best movies on Rotten Tomatoes, or most critic's choices for the best movies of all time, and you'll see that Citizen Kane is high up on that list. 




 It's an absolute to you, but not to the majority of people who think it is the best movie of all time.  




 I suggest you watch The Godfather Part II. It's a more interesting/faster paced story, and it reveals more about Michael and Vito as characters. 




 But so many things *about* it shaped what came *after* it. It changed the industry as a whole, which is a very hard thing to do. 




 When did I say that? 




 Give me an example. 




 Because it's a practically perfect story, that's fantastically well written, with some of the best acting of all time. Very few flaws, if any.

 




 ... About what? 




 Yeah, but if you really want to know why it's considered the best movie of all time, watching it would help you understand what people are talking about.  




 Every moment you might think is cliche or overused? Citizen Kane started that. Appreciate it for what it is, and realize that modern filmmaking wouldn't be anywhere close to what it is today without that movie. 




 Everest? Macbeth? 




 Macbeth! Steve Jobs! Prometheus 2! X-Men Apocalypse! 




 This is actually the THIRD installment in the critically acclaimed Birds series!

http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0109275/ 




 Huh. I actually think Ewan McGregor could've been a good Bond 




 What? Like the original *didn't* have young children playing an important role in the movie? 









 Radio Bart will always hold a special place in my heart. Marge in Chains and Treehouse of Horror V are close behind, though. 




 Well, would you rather have a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? 




 Too bad it's a true story.  




 Jurassic Park - Always amazing

Lost World - Liked it

JPIII - Bad, but entertaining and fun  




 What are you doing on this sub if you don't like their jokes? 

And by the way, you made a suggestion, and multiple people pointed out why it won't happen. No use arguing it. 




 REVAN CONFIRMED 




 MI: 5 




 I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life... 




 How? 




 "Knowing how to read will be useful when you're older"

Yup, checks out. 




 Back to the Future. 




 Too perfect. 




 Jack! Please! 




 I mean, there not even really that nerdy... 




 "Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most... Human"

Was a hell of a thing when Spock died... 




 Mkay 




 Spike  




 Its based on a true story 




 And Andy! And Olaf! And Marbles! 




 Don't forget Westworld! 




 Oh I thought something looked strange about the rest of those guys... To tired to think 




 What? 




 /uj I don't know if it's part of the jerkin' or not, but Stanley Kubrick was American /uj 




 Not anymore it isn't! 




 The Empire Strikes Back 




  stage 19 elbow cancer 




 ["Why would you shoot me in the kidney?!"](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvYkmG5iGU) 




 It *is* an iPhone accessory  




 Dude, it's coming out years from now. I'm sure the script is still being worked on. No updates does not automatically mean it has been cancelled. 




 No 




 I would think its the writers more than the director  




 Wrath of Kahn? The Voyage Home? 




 I know what you mean, but pirates seem to smell lol chlorine to me 




 Agreed 




 Chlorine  




 It created a lot of the modern cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques that are commonplace today.

http://www.slate.com/articles/life/ft/2011/05/the_mark_of_kane.html 




 Not just revolutionizing film at its time, but film as a medium in general. So much of TDK would be different if Citizen Kane didn't exist, and the same goes for every other modern movie. 




 No - episode vii this year, episode viii in 2017, and episode IX in 2019 




 Yeah, but Mike Stoklasa isn't anywhere near as well known as those guys 




 What? 




 Last Star Wars film in 2017? No way Jose! You still have Anthology 2 in 2018 and Episode IX in 2019, and I doubt Disney will stop there! 




 Maybe, maybe... 




 /u/trollabot test_subject3827 




 Yeah - above *Citizen Kane?* 




 Ah okay
