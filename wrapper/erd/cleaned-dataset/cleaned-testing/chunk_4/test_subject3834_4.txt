 Yeah, in general, I've found it to be less reliable for stun-locking enemies, but the 2h/transformed charged attack will send the lesser to regular to large enemies flying everytime, though the diagnal angle can make it a bit less user friendly than say the horizontal spin2win of the hunter's axe. 




 They are too loud and obnocious, just like the crows.  My issue is that I'm pretty sure there is little to no fade in these sound effects, so no matter how close or far I am from the mob, it sounds like they are screaming or barking in my ears at a gajillion decibals  




 Haha.  You've put together 1% of the story so far :D

Keep going.  There is so much more to it! 




 Yep.  That being said, I've had my fair share of, "Fuck those guys and their cheap ass frenzy mechanic!"


I do think frenzy could have been worked in better.  It should either do a large chunk of damage, but less than what it currently does, like 50-60% health tops, or keep it at 70% damage, but not let it kill you, so at most, it would reduce your HP to 1. 




 Wow.  That's crazy-awesome.  Good on your friend.  


Man, I never fight that thing head on simply due to the zero margin of error allowed fight for a cursed dungeon, plus, everytime I've ever tried to engage him close, he often chains his regular attack with a charge or leap at point blank, and dat hitbox gets me everytime from such a close range.   Guess I just need to git guuder.  Also, I don't play my Chikevyln too often, so that option of bone-marrow ashing the last large chunk of his health for safety and ease hasn't been an option :/ 




 Once you create a chalice, can you still join other glyphs even if you take that original chalice down?  I mean, I know you have to create the original chalice type to be able to join a glyph of the same dungeon type, but is that memory inherent in your game/character, or do you have to leave the original chalice up the whole time? 




 I hate them too, but they're not that cheap.  There are lots of tools to deal with them, including ranged weapons, sedatives, frenzy resist armor, and frenzy resist runes.


The brains are a prime example of what the souls games do best:  they put extreme pressure on players, intentionally inducing panic and "what the shit is going on?" confusion mode, which in turn causes players to panic, and thus not play as methodically and carefully as they must in a Souls game.


Like any other enemy or boss, if you approach them methodically and with patience and a level-head, they can be easily taken down, and create that satisfaction that the Souls games are known for. 




 But DaS2 was a B-Team thing, so I think it would be more likely to be seen in BB than DaS2, but still, I wouldn't necessarily count on it or expect it :D 




 Really?  I was never hit by any of his jump attacks ever, just by staying locked onto him, and dodging forward (to where he is diving from), right as he is diving, and thus, he winds up behind you, and you can just turn to face him and click to quick-turn the camera around to attack him again. 




 Comment so I can find this later.  Thanks for the links :D 




 They are awesome weapons. I find Ludwig's to be a bit dull, but the chikage is fun to play with, and to play against.

And Yes, rifle spear is OP, but only cuz it's broke as shit right now, an it's a shame because its such a fun weapon.  




 It's not OP, It's just plain bugged.  Ludwig and Chikage is OP, considering how easy and quick you can build a character to do top-shelf damage with those weapons, even with no depth 5 gem-farming. 




 Because reddit has the dumbest ranking system, and the arbitrary down-voting and upvoting system is totally horse shit, and just like any other form of trolling or bitching on the internet - it is unregulated and unchallenged and it doesn't really mean anything :D 




 Ha ha.  Wot a storee Mahrk! 




 Yeah, Yogg Saron was a long time ago... 




 That's so... gay? 




 Loran Darkbeast is fairly telegraphed and easy to dodge though once you figure it out, though his movesets are a lot more brutal than Paarl, and he can easily one shot you once he is fully charged and doing some of his bad ass moves.  Havne't gotten to Ebrietas on my level 4 beast-bro, as I have been mostly working on my beastbro, but my onebro runs are usually the last thing I do in a SOULS games once I am border-line done with it.  OH HAI COLLETE! 




 Are you gemming the burial blade correctly?  You can get an easy 650-750 AR with the correct gems, which are the +8-9% physical gems with the flat +70ish arcane damage.  The burial blade is bad-ass, it just takes longer to optimize since you have to farm depth 5 chalices, whereas, you can make your +10 chikage or +10 evelyn or +10 ludwig's bad-ass with minimal time and gem-farming investments, which is why it is the easy sort of go-to common-cheese builds :D 




 The burial blade is much harder to optimize than other weapons, as you need to get to lowest level chalice dungeons to obtain the odd gems that are like +9% physical and +70ish flat arcane damage.  Those gems are built for BoM and Burial Blade.  Furthermore, I think the best is the Uncanny Burial Blade, as it has a triangle gem slot so you can add another %physical damage +flat arcane gem, since most of the waning gems are crap for that setup. 




 Yeah, it's super easy to raise super-high with minimal stat and time investments too :/ 




 Yeah.  You have to master the camera adjustment of facing your character opposite direction, and tapping the right stick button to auto-orient your character with direction he is facing.  Next game:  Cameraborne, where the hardest enemy you fight is the camera, and they are all cameras.  Oh god.  I'm having PTSD flashbacks about the centipede demon in DaS.  WHY GWYNN WHY!?!!  YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! 




 oh god, what an abomination! 




 Yeah, the "why" of most FROM games is seldom the point, or all that important.  It is a rash of people and characters dealing with the "what" of it, often futilely until the bitter end.  The point is, life is a bitch, then you die.  It's all so pointless.  Fuck it. 




 Stop spoiling your game play!  You only get one chance at a first time play-through, so drink every last drop of that coagulated menstrual blood and take your punishment! 




 Yep.  I killed him on another toon last night, and took me a few tries to readjust to the whole delayed movements and dodges.  But I totally enjoyed the waltz of it once I got the timing right again :D 




 If you are using BoM, stunlock her into a wall, a pillar, or just stun lock her period, as she will likely wind up pinned up against something in general.  If you have 15 arcane, you can use beast roar to make this fight even more trivial.  R1 spam your BoM until your stamina is gone, immediately use beast roar, then resume spamming, but don't give her a second to even begin attacking, or she might one or two shot you.  And if you can keep her pinned at the part where she imbues her weapon with fire, and don't let her complete the enchantment, she will spend the rest of the light trying to light her sword on fire, like some retarded child trying to light water on fire. 




 And if I open those, then all dungeons are open to me?  Because I thought I would be limited to only exact matches, ie., cursed, fetid loran = only cursed fetid loran 




 So if you make a dungeon with all offerings (ex, Isz root or loran root), then you can join any dungeon with any combination of those offerings?  Thanks. 




 There is no proof from what Micolash says that Rom was once human, and was turned into kin or anything else.  There is no way to prove what he says as literal, as it can just as well be taken in the same manner as someone saying "god gave birds wings so they could fly."  It doesn't mean god reached down and glued wings on ferrets and thus that is where birds came from, as if it was just a gift that was given, it just means, 'as they were made/created/evolved/born."  There is no concrete proof for either case, but I find it odd that every human character in game has a lot of screen time, dialogue, or info via item descriptions, yet there is nothing related to 'Rom the human' anywhere.  I don't think this is an oversight.  I think Rom is what he has always been, and whatever that may be, it never was human. 




 Ok. Cool. I think that will be a good go to spot to get guaranteed radial gems with minimal farming for my burial blade. Thank you.  




 The official guide. There have been a lot of posts listing pictures of the guide. Look up your primary weapons and the damage types and multipliers in those posts.  




 It depends. Flat physical affects all damage types (phys, thrust, blunt) but if you are primarily using blunt or thrust attacks, it might do you well to double check what other gems you can docket in there to maximize what attacks you use the most, especially since different attacks have different modifiers. It also depends if the enemy is open or not.  




 Another note:  40 dex is a shit ton of investment for a weapon that is best and meant to be utilized in 2handed Bloodtinge form - that is what you do your killing with, the R1's are just for transforming there and back to minimize the HP leak.  Chikage is not for a dex build, and you also lose out on Eve's damage with non hard-capped BT.  I would have gone to 20-25 skill max, and instead gone for 15 arcane for the hunter's tools, as beast roar is stupid OP and easy to stunlock people with (as well as your only parry type defense while using 2h stance, which is dangerous with only 26 vit), and maybe pumped vit to at least 30, especially if you are going to be invading people. 




 While fun to play (with and against), I'm sort of sad that the majority of my fights are against BT chikage/eves or Ludwigs :(


Makes me with there were more weapons in this game, or at least, more go to ridiculously powerful weapons, rather,  more viable and competitively powerful weapons, that are as easy to obtain and get the most out of them with minimal time investment and little to no farming.  I'm enjoying my burial blade build right now, but to get to the best gems for it, I have to run to the ends of the chalice dungeons and farm the lowest levels, as there are no +physical % damage +flat arcane anywhere in the main game or basic chalices, whereas you can put a few easy to obtain +18 to +20% gems in the chikage and call it a day 


edit:  specifics 




 I know a lot of people that need to revisit the past and learn how to spell :P 




 Doctor:  "Please point to the chart and tell me exactly how it is that you suck so much." 




 Don't forget the baby great ones or surrogates or whatever they are - all those little slug things that just stare longingly at the celestial garden/alter of despair. 




 Great write up, thank you, but due to the format of one of the first parts, can you please clarify that this info is correct:


*EDIT; If you want guaranteed radials with physical % and arcane add:*

*Glyph: ba362b97*

*Location: Phtumeru Ihyll root.*

*Rites: Cursed, Foetid, Rotten.*

*Unlock lever, and farm the brainsucker mob guarding the treasure chest in the t-room before the first boss. The best it can drop is a rating 17 gem, but its a guaranteed radial...*


That edit was for all the information below, right?  Also, do you know what the first boss of this dungeon is?  Ie., is the boss itself worth farming for gems too?  (I mean, you would have probably mentioned it if it was, but still worth asking)  Thanks.


edit:  grammar/clarity 




 Aside a bloodtinge build, which is this game's ranged build equivelent (which a FROM game should have), guns do little to minimal damage, especially on the later bosses who have a billion HP and can kill you in one or two hits, but I am wasting my breath, as you are either a retarded troll, one ignorant motherfucker, or just plain retarded, period. 




 Mr souls veteran here took 6 tries to kill cleric beast and 4 for papa G?  An easy boss is one you can kill in one or two tries, and you taking that many attempts is pathetic.  I killed cleric beast my first try and it took me two tries to kill Papa G in my very first NG cycle ever.  You sound like a noob, and a lot of your fellow newbs spend hours and days and weeks getting past these areas your having a hard time with. 




 The brain trusts always sing as far as I can tell. And the baby starts crying as soon as you beat rom. That beig said, no one has come up with a decent lore connection of the messengers and who what and why they are, and even more intriguing, no one has yet to adequately explain why Mind of Mensis and the Winterb Lantern's brain matter is made out of dead messengers  




 Dude. Beast roar is awesome. You can counter projectiles and knock lesser foes and bosses and PCs on their asses. I think I'm gonna put 15 arcane in all my builds from here on out. Fuck having 50 vitality :D 




 Parry or beast roar or use longer ranged weapons for those bitches. I dont get why people have such a huge problem with BoM. No worse than the spam fest that goes on with a lot of other weapons, and I happen to find BoM the easiest to counter :D 




 I still don't understand how the motion control crap works. Alls I know is I occasionally perform the most inopurtune gesture that you can't cancel easily like in DaS  




 Yeah. Unique and fun weapons like Dragon bone fist and majestic greatsword were fun to fuck around with too.  




 You mean Christians?  Sounds like Christians to me :D 




 Whoa... let me just adjust my in-foil hat for this one...and.... yes!  I totally agree!  He is in fact Laurence and imposter Isofeka and the blood minister from the beginning of the game all at once even! 




 Yeah, but pre DLC, you could aquire double digit slabs easy in the course of the main game, and once they released the expansions, you could swim in them.  Sure, you couldn't upgrade every weapon right away, but there were too many similar and samey weapons in that game anyhow. 




 Ha.  No sweat.  You had started off our earlier discussion fairly level headed, so I thought it was a bit strange that you were all-of-a-sudden throwing out completely irrelevant evidence and ideas :)


That being said, now I'm curious about this whole "gherman isn't gherman" thing, which, I think is a ridiculous idea and there is no reason or evidence to believe so, but still, I'm curious... 




 Ah, I've only seen a few gargoyles here or there in chalice dungeons, and no, never saw a chunk drop in there, but it's not like I farmed the gargoyles either :D 




 Wow.  Someone sure is feeling murderous today, huh? :D 




 Just wait for the next two bosses!  I'd rather fight 3 keepers at the same time over them!  The hot dog is one of the worst, but if you have the patience and are super careful, you can beat him really easily, you just can't really fuck it up at all, and either way, it will just take a long ass time.  As for the keeper, on my STR toon I just parried/visceraled her and duked it out old fashioned style, and on my SKL toon, I kept the keeper stun-locked with R1 spam from Blades of Mercy, then knocked her to the floor with beast-roar once I ran out of stamina, then I rinsed, and repeated till she died.  She escaped it once or twice and killed me once or twice, but I just whomped her that way for simplicity's sake  :D


Edit:  And your level is fine. 94 is plenty high to do any of the game. 




 I have yet to get a chunk in a dungeon, from a gargoyle enemy or anywhere else.  Can they be found in chests or on the ground or something in chalices?  Or just from enemies? 




 Those are two distinct differences though, as the imposter actually has dialogue and is voiced by two separate actors, whereas the apprentice only exists on an item description, so I fail to see the point of your reasoning?. 




 So you can dupe and glitch, but then you can't carry those characters forward and keep them?  That doesn't sound all that worth it :/ 




 I think it took me 4 or 5 vicerals to kill him in NG+ with the +30 and +20% visceral runes :D 




 There are plenty of one-offs and non-sequitters in these games.  Not everything is long and well-crafted and intertwined through the whole story.  This may or may not be one of those one-offs, but the point remains, it can be read and interpreted in either manner, with no concrete evidence favoring one over the other.  Read it as you choose. 




 Even if they are low level, at the least they probably have +9 or +10 weapons, with possibly the best gems farmed from chalice dungeons or late game, or maybe they've duped a zillion chunks and rocks (not sure if it works on gems).  This is why I said *'best to run to end game to make your toon more competitive in PvP,'* meaning, some of these people could have built these toons week 1 or 2 of BB's release (or even more recently), and they have had many days and weeks on their characters to farm for better gems and fully upgrade all their primary gear to +9 or +10, on top of finding the best gems.  (Also, they might have their gems, weapons and builds better itemized than you).


Edit:  Like the guy above said, I've "speed ran" my three PvP toons to end game to have decent gems and all primary weapons at +9 or +10, and I'm still clearing out chalices on a few of them.  And by speed-run, I mean, it only takes a night or two of gamplay to get the runes, the levels, and the primary weapons I need to +9 or +10, and to pretty much be at end game, and have my toon where he can hold his own.


Edit 2:  As for your damage, double check with the guide to make sure you are gemming your weapon properly.  Ie., you might be gemming your hunter's axe for pure physical damage, yet, only most of the weaker, 1H attacks are physical damage for the HA, where all the 2h heavy attacks are calculated as blunt damage.  Thus, if you gem the hunter's axe for all physical damage, but only use heavy blunt 2h attacks, then you are heavily crippling your potential damage output. 




 And the saves will be compatible?  1.0 will run the current characters from 2.0 or whatever the current build is?  And then once you upgrade the current build will be comptaible with your characters you took from 2.0 to 1.0?  If so, hell yeah!


 




 Fast track was Isofeka's clinic glitch, but I heard they fixed that, which is kinda obnoxious if you've already leveled a toon or two normally and want to create some different builds to get into PvP ASAP and stay competitive in PvP.  My one regret is I didn't level up an arcane and a quality toon while that was still available.


I'd say your best bet is to play the game through towards end game as normal so you can get enough upgrade materials and ruins to make the build you want and stay competitive - and it shouldn't take that long as the game is super short, especially once you are more familiar with it.  You could also create a totally viable and competitive PvP build at level 60-90 with decent gear and a +8 or 9 main weapon with minimal time investment, but it depends on what you are looking for.  Back to the first point - playing through the main game will also give you some practice since you might be playing with weapons and items you aren't familiar with (ie., going from a main STR build to a PvP BT or SKL build).  A lot of people insist on 50 vitality as a must for all PvP toons due to the invader 30% health debuff, and while it almost helps in making up for that stupid handicap, it isn't necessary, though I do notice I tend to win more when I'm the one being invaded, and not doing the invading.  All that being said, you don't need to min-max in this game to be successful.  As with all the souls games, superior individual player skill will always win out over superior items, upgrades, runes, and so forth.  Good luck to you~ 




 Well, there are a lot less things to upgrade in BB, but at least slabs were super common in DaS2, and chunks could eventually be purchased, and twinklings and dragon bones (the hardest to collect en masse) were super easy and quick to farm too, especially once you got to the late game, and they were at least guaranteed spawns.  Like farming in any game, it is a pretty obnoxious time sink and poor design imo, but it is and was still better than upgrade item availability in BB  :/ 




 To be fair. BSB's poison AIDS is no joke. And you're probably not too terrible if you made it to BSB period. Yes te game game gets harder, but you will likely become better at it. Take a break and come back later. Sometimes that's all you need for these games :D 




 Not really. It is just subtle and cryptic, which FROM does quite often and quite well.  




 Well, he never really befriends you, he just doesn't try to kill you. But yes, you can still talk to him so long as you enter old yharnam through the back route. But be careful, I don't know if killing the hunter below makes him permanently hostile or not, so don't engage either in combat. Just come back later after you've unlocked the short cuts an you can make your way up all those ladders to talk to him.  




 Hehe.  Bet it sucked to be him! 




 Thanks for the info.  I was just looking at the game on steam, and it seems smarter to pay 20 dollars to upgrade DaS2 on the Pc, rather than having to pay full price for SoTFF elsewhere :D 




 Hey all.  I've been lost in Bloodborne since release (which I bought a PS4 for), and I have been thoroughly enjoying both the PvE and the PvP, but I did want to eventually pick up SoTFF.  I played the hell out of DaS2 on PC, and while part of me doesn't want to pay for the same game again, I was curious what my fellow hardcore Souls fans thought of SoTFF, as well as if anyone had some ideas as to which system it plays best on?  Or what the main differences are, as I've read the graphics were over-hauled for both PC and console versions.  (For reference, I have a PS4 and a PC to choose from, no XBox1)


That being said, how is the funcionality of the different systems?  I prefer to game on PC, because my PC performs better than the PS4, better graphics, I like keyboards, etc (though I still play Souls games with a controller), but I heard that the console versions can support up to six persons in a multiplayer game?  But the PC release doesn't?  Any other big differences like that between them?


And in general, what have you guys thought of SoTFF so far?  Is it true that SoTFF comes with all three DLC's?  Thanks in advance for your responses  :) 




 Again, it is very well-written, and one of the most beautiful gems in the whole of the first game was the easy-to-miss, right-under-your-nose hint dropped in your first NPC encounter of the game:


Oscar the Fateless straight up says, "...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... *But perhaps you can keep the torch lit...* There is an old saying in my family... Thou who art Undead, art chosen..."


The whole "keep the torch lit" is a direct reference to the kiln of the first flame, and yet, you would have never known it your first time through, and even on subsequent play-throughs, it is absolutely easy to miss this tasty and subtle reference.  Again, that's good writing  :D 




 Right, which would likely be a bastardized, incestuous dose of the Queen's blood.


Did you ever play Dark Souls?  There is an exact similar situation at the beginning of that game, where FROM does the exact same thing - they allude to a very specific piece of information that you would just never understand or 'get' on your first play through (or ever for that matter if you are inattentive).  I don't want to say it in case you've never played it cuz spoilers... 




 I like how literal and hidden in plain-sight you can take the translation. That blood in the beginning?


"Where's an outsider like you to start?  With a little bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  


He could be literally injecting you with queen Yharnam's blood. And yes, I suppose it could be menstrul blood, or from the afterbirth.  




 Bingo. I just posted this a little while ago:


Ah, but you are just reading it a particular way:  "Bone of an old hunter whose name is lost."  It doesn't say "bone that *came from* and old hunter whose name is lost."  While there are thigs to be lost and found in translation, that is still a massive difference in language use. The item description clearly tells us the one who used it was an apprentice of Gherman, but it does not clearly say where it comes from. Think about that :D

 Yep. And to be honest, I don't really care for the different physical attack values, but maybe there was good reason for it. If all attacks were just physical, they probably would have had to tone every weapon down to do less damage.  




 That, and it wouldn't make sense to have blunt/thrust go through a double dip for damage mitigation. It would essentially mean all thrust and blunt stacks would be weaker due to stacking defense types, which would be quite retarded.  




 Honestly, FROM has been a revitalizing force in what has been the stagnant industry of gaming, aside the already well established formulas, and the one offs and innovative indie studios. 


I warn you - if you pick up bloodborne, it will likely ruin gaming for you, and if you play the previous souls titles, every other game will feel like hello kitty island adventure where you run around with a bunch of school girls slapping each other with wet noodles, and hardly any game out there will even come close to the satisfaction, risk, reward, and enjoyment of playing a game made by FROM Soft...


You have been warned.  




 That is a very keen connection, and a very cool theory. Can we run with that? 




 Yeah. I'm too used to playing with the sweeping motion of the larger weapons too, so the spread just seemed unnecessary for me I suppose.  




 Right. They seem to recover a bit quicker, but you can spam it again in a split second if you so choose anyhow. Again. Personal preference I guess. I don't like the way the shotguns handle :D 




 Not to split hairs, but "It was said" and "He was" are two very difference ways of saying something.  But now that you have me thinking about it, the only other hunter in game we encounter who uses quickening (if I'm not mistaken) is the Chikage hunter in the grand cathedral.  Do you think that is the same apprentice that is mentioned int he description of the old bone?  I know the guide calls him "The cainhurst crow" or whatever, but it still gives us nothing definitive...  




 Whoa, slow it down professor!  Are you sure?  Let me write this down. 




 At point blank they can do some damage, but pistols stagger beasts just the same as the shotguns.  The shotguns have a wider arc, which just seems to promote sloppy play, and why bother with a pellet spread when you can swing a wide weapon like the axe or scythe or sword and stagger a group of enemies just the same, or use a beast roar, or throw a molotov or any number of options that actually do more damage or provide you with more utility.  I just tend to find that nearly every other item/weapon in the game has better utility than the shotguns, the exception being the rifle spear, because it allows you to parry while 2handing a transformed weapon.  Again, this is my personal preference and play-style, and I was over-all kind of dissapointed that the shotguns didn't have a more unique and effective usage. 




 The repeater pistol outdamages Eveylyn at high Blood tinge, but that is because it fires two bullets, and you go through your resources faster that way.  Being that it can be easy to miss with bullets, I found Eve to be the better choice, as it is accurate and fires fast, and other than having fun playing with the rifle spear (non-bugged version), I've found absolutely no real use for the pellet spread of the blunderbuss or shotgun type weapons.  Sure, it is supposed to do damage, but that damage is negligible outside of a blood tinge build (especially in NG+ cycles, depth 5 chalices, etc), since your focus isn't on playing a ranged build.  


That being said, is this for PvP or PvE?  Because I've found no reason to use anything but the hunter's pistol for non Blood-Tinge builds in PvE.  The pistol fires fast, is accurate, and you can shoot enemies at point blank (unlike the Eve which is too long, and will often shoot past enemies or other players at point blank range).  There is the blunderbuss, but I found it to be slow, clunky, and the damage it does in no way justifies how it leaves you more open to attacks on account of how slow it is.  Then there is the repeating pistol, which does more damage, but that is only because it uses twice the resources.  If you are thinking about the damage your guns can do, it doesn't really matter as much when you're not a BT build.  It's about utility and it becomes more of a personal preference or what you think is fun and stylish, though I can't speak about ludwig's holy rifle and the modifier of holy damage, as I don't know that much about it.


As for other reasons to increase your gun damage, sure, occasionally an enemy will have a slice of HP left after a fight, and it can be convenient to shoot them once or twice to kill them, but again, it isn't needed or warranted if that's not how you've dedicated your build, though it depends on your playstyle.


At the end of the day, weapon damage in the souls games comes down to the conservation of movements.  Take for example an enemy that has 3000 health, be it PC or NPC.  Let's say you set out to kill it with three gunshots leading into three visceral attacks.  If your gun does 200 points of damage, and your visceral attacks do 800 points of damage, then you kill the enemy in those six moves:  gun shot parry+visceral, gun shot parry+visceral, and one more gun shot parry+visceral for a total of 3000 damage.  The enemy is now dead.


Then let's say you decide to pump your bloodtinge, so your gun shots now do 250 damage (up from 200).  It might seem handy or helpful to have that little extra damage, as sometimes we do find ourselves dying in a situation where an enemy only has a tiny slice of life left and one more gunshot would kill it, but the fact remains that in the same scenario above, it doesn't change the amount of attacks it takes to kill an enemy:

1st parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy has 1950 HP left now

2nd parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy now has 900 health left

3rd parry+visceral - 1,050 damage - enemy is now dead, but the damage added through pumping another 10-20 points in BT is negligible, because he would have been dead anyway, and thus you wasted points in BT.


I know people can argue any number of ways on this, but imo BT and gun damage is useless outside dedicated builds, and thus the weapon you use is a matter of personal preference, be it for effectiveness, feel, or style, and I've just found the regular old Hunter's Pistol to be too damn awesome and reliable to not use, and it is easy enough to get it to +9 (along with your other favorite weapons) to where you can use it as viable damage output should you find yourself facing off with an enemy who winds up with a tiny sliver of health left (though less so in depth 5 chalices and higher NG+ cycles).  Hope this helps, now go hunt in style!  o/


edit:  grammar/clarity

Edit 2:  Back to the reliability of the pistol - it staggers enemies just the same as the blunderbuss, but it is just faster and super accurate :D
 




 Unless you're going full or super-high BT build, I wouldn't bother with Evelyn, as the Hunter's Pistol is on par for damage with it until like, early 20's bloodtinge.  And if you are going to invest that much in BT (Eve requires 18 I think, which is a lot for non-primary damage), and you don't pump it up more to use a chikage, you are pretty much gimping what could otherwise be a higher damage, more focused skill build, or wasting what could be a full (40-50) bloodtinge build with a good 20-25 in skill, utilizing your stats best with chikage as your main weapon and eve for damage and utility.  


If you want or care to do actual damage with your firearm, yes, I'd say go full BT or a skill/BT build with eve and/or rifle spear and chikage, but if you are just using firearms for utility, then waste as few possible points in BT as you can get away with:D 




 Would love to spar sometime this weekend.  I have 3 semi-complete PvP builds that are staying around level 90-98, but I'm not sure of the best way to do so in this game since there are no soap stones, and passwords don't affect PvP. I imagine the best way to do it is by grabbing the first root chalice available and using that glyph. What do you think?


Edit:  not sure I I'll have the time to grind out the chalices on all/any of my PvP toons just yet, as I'm pretty sure the hunter tombs key chalice is required for chalice PvP 




 I'm not seeing it. Also, I'd likely suspect lag as being the culprit :D 




 I think the final allure in this game (like the other souls titles) is PvP, and challenge runs. Ie, like someone below said, it isn't about just getting gear. It is about the challenge itself, such as the triple offering dungeons 




 Stun lock on lesser foes. You should be able to own most enemies in les than 1 bar of stamina, and for total pwnage, for a measly total 15 points of investment in arcane, you spam until your stamina is gone, then use beast roar ASAP to knock them over, and by the time the enemy stands up again, you should have enough stamina back to rinse and repeat. 


For multiple enemies, I'd suggest either playing unlocked for quick turning to be able to stab whoever is coming at you, or be quick to flick the lock on to whoever gets closest, enabling you to still spam constantly without getting swarmed, though with how bad the camera can be at times, it might get you killed until you are more accustomed to it. 


Eit:  I hate using BoM for PvP though. Sure, im not practices enough with them in PvP to really speak to their power, but Between the lack of range and the latency of multiplayer, I can't stand using them against other players :D 




 Tots casul troll. But the point remains. She is an way boss. 


Edit:  just realized he said no heal run. That's insane. I'm pretty far on my level 4bro that I don't play too often, but I imagine i'd get quite sick of an angry at the game if I tried that.  




 I either stockpile them early to get a few levels, save them for when I want to splurge on consumables, or use them to push me over the edge to be able to level later in the game.  As for the mad-men's wisdoms, I wouldn't use those until you need them, since a brain-sucker might steal them, and there is no shortage of insight in the game.  I tend to use insight/wisdoms to purchase armors and crafting materials at the insight vendor. 




 Dude, if you're anything like me, you hate the cane.  The poke/poke of the cane is fun and effective, but the whip is slow, and does low damage, and pretty much every other weapon with a little bit of reach (ie, wide slahes of rifle spear) do a better job of staggering or knocking over enemies and doing crowd control.  The cane has a certain cool factor to it, especially when imbued with fire as it looks amazing, but I found it to be far too weak, and slow as shit in whip mode, and it seems to be outclassed by every other longer-ranged weapon in game, particularly the axe or burial blade.  I didn't do a whole playthrough with rifle-spear, but I did play through half the game with it, but it was one of my favorite and most fun weapons to play with, though it was a bit weak compared to the damage I could do with some of the other weapons (and no, I'm not talking +flat arcane bug).  It just depends on what movesets and abilities you like.
