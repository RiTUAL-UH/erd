 That was really obvious, I'm surprised OP didn't notice 




 Just because he's wearing a black suit, you're assuming he has a large penis? Wow. 




 So it was that vendetta not the fact that he found out he was going to become the Flash's enemy by going back in the past that drove him to become the Flash's enemy?  




 What was Barry doing in the 25th century? 




 Why so fucking long between seasons? 




 Wells said Barry's body could lead to vaccines and stuff. Why did they never go through with this research? 




 Wow Joe was so harsh on Barry. Joe was so adamant that Barry's dad killed Barry's mom. 









 This. 




 What episode is this?? 




 This is quote from my thread. 

Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy. 




 same 




 Does that include twerking? 




 Same. I was looking forward to seeing more of that after the pilot but NO. 




 In the comics, Eobard Thawne (Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash) was a huge Flash fan and travelled back in time to meet Barry Allen. However, he miscalculated and ended up in a time after Barry Allen died and discovered that he was destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy which drove him crazy.  

My question is... how would he be destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy if he was born after Barry Allen died? (Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy.)

Hopefully this question makes sense.  It's something that always has bothered me about Eobard Thawne's background.

EDIT: Fuck you downvotes. It was a genuine question. 




 did he get fired? 




 Stealth Mode suit. 




 Your EDIT and your TIL are the same thing 




 At 5'5'', he's taller than Captain America. (Steve Rogers, Pre-Serum) 




 Nice artwork! 




 I'm fucking astonished at this man's logic. Read a fucking book. 




 south park 




 Not God, Grodd. 




 Yeah, a costume like that wouldn't be flattering for her frame.

Dem hips in the pic though. Goddamn. 




 Why not? 




 Subway? 




 You got ripped off on that meal plan, my friend. I would be quite disappointed if I were you. 




 You like? ;) 




 I'm glad you're still around friend :) 




 have you ever met your future self 




 was that movie bad or something 




 Did you punish /u/technologicalbrian ? 




 Sara was the closest thing we'll get to that 




 I think that the only reason I will watch this show is because Kara is really cute.

[NSFW] [She looks cuter when she's about to get fucked.](http://thefappening.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Melissa-Benoist-Naked-02.jpg) 




 Cliche evil twin. 




 The boss makes me want to quit watching this show. Bitch, you're not hot. 




 That brings me hope. Olicity must die. 




 what the hell 




 should've allowed the voices and sound effects to play simultaneously like the first few dialogues from braniac-luthor 




 Laurel's full name is Dinah Laurel Lance. Laurel is Dinah. 









 that's how it happens in the comics 




 so much leather 




 Read the title. 




 I wonder why so many fans are pushing for the brighter red suit with the white emblem then. 




 And blacks getting killed by white cops, amirite? 




 Happy Cake Day. 




 Not all Asians are racist /: 




 Holy shit, I stopped playing for a little over a year and Raigeki is unbanned? 




 How did he get her if Barry created her though? Obviously Barry created her for his own use 




 Anyway, why does the timeline not reset when Eddie shoots himself?

It can't because, by killing himself, Eddie created an infinite loop paradox so the whole timeline decided to collapse on itself by creating a black hole. 









 the second one looks way better. 




 Vibrating hand of death. 




 I bet it was because he was also affected that night when the Particle Accelerator exploded. 




 So which was the majority!? Darker or Same???? 




 Yeah I was like what the hell 




 Did I ever mention that it wasn't my fault? 




 Too masculine. Couldn't tell it was a female. 




 Forget two weeks, a few hours is enough for middle-eastern blood. 




 This thread has negative 2 comments LMAO.

But, yeah just watch the first two seasons of Arrow in order then watch Arrow season 3 and start Flash Season 1 simultaneously with watching Flash episodes before Arrow episodes. It all lines up in order. 




 If only it was a darker red like the costume. 




 Looks like a rotten banana. 




 I dunno, Flash and Arrow had more enjoyable pilots, imo.

I don't like the clich "anti-hero" hates protagonist up until protagonist saves his/her life or something along those lines.

Jimmy Olsen was always a young comic relief character in the comics/DCAU continuity.    he's a grown ass black man here which makes me wonder what Lois Lane looks like.

But, hey, the effects are decent. 




 No, there were 3 Barry's BEFORE our Barry time-travelled.  There were 4 Barry's in the finale.  Young Barry, Future Barry (who came back to save his mother and his younger self), Future Barry (who went back in time again after Flashpoint events from saving his mother to stop his younger self from saving his mother), and Our Barry. 




 Definitely not on-par with Arrow/Flash. Probably won't end up in the same universe. 




 Welcome to the Hotel California 




 Fuck you 









 Technically, he   other Barry *are the same person*. 




 Time Travel won't be invented until 30 years from now. 




 Never grew wisdom teeth and I never will. 




 no one saw.

Except Sasuke, right? That was one of the reasons he gave into receiving Cursed Seal LV. 2. 




 I mean if Naruto can become Hokage without ever promoting from Genin, I wouldn't say it's impossible for Lee to promote to whatever he wants. 




 An auto reply replied by an auto reply replied by an auto reply replied by an auto reply? Would've made sense if it was 3 times and not 4. 




 It says there are seeds on the site though with the info on the right (you know what i mean) 




 Yeah these torrents are pretty old about two or three years. 




 Good bye, Dad. 




 So, basically - no Flashpoint confirmed.

Great analysis, I too had my theories that there were possibly four Barrys in that room and this all makes sense.  




 I'm excited for what's to come.  Do you think we'll be seeing the white emblem costume again in Season 2? 




 AGREED 




 Yes Cisco 




 I just noticed the similarity between the two endings. 




 Why were the same two tweets posted twice? That confused me for a minute. 




 Her teeth appear to be quite big for her mouth size. 




 Do you think it'd be a mix of a Dynamic Timeline as well as the Multiverse Model? One could theorize that the reason Future Barry knew where, our, Present Barry was immediately and told him not to follow through with his plans was because Future Barry had already gone through the events of Flashpoint and not only went back in time, once again, to save his younger self but to also prevent his past self to ensue the events of Flashpoint in the first place.

Thus, a loop? 




 4 minutes in and this thread already got downvoted multiple times... what's wrong guys? 




 Infinite loop 




 Why would he choose not to have the life he always dreamed of...? That was the biggest plot twist for me. 









 I can't download anything. 




 The show *just had its* finale, so it won't be on Netflix till the Fall.

FTFY. Sorry, was bothering me while reading it.
 




 Let's call him a distant relative. 




 My name... is Eobard Thawne. -nod- 




 Any good? 




 Your comment just fucked my brain. 




 LOL. that was so unexpected. thought you were gonna say he was retarded or something 




 yes. 




 And, if so, does that mean no possibility for updated suit? :( 




 And a much brighter red! 




 That makes a lot of sense, thank you friend. Any chance we're gonna see our Barry get Future Barry's suit in Season 2? 




 So, Future Flash has already experienced the Flashpoint events? 




 the only thing that bugs me when i first saw it and that still bugs me now seeing it again is the mouth. 




 That makes a lot of sense, thank you very much friend. 




 Thank you for the great analysis and explanation. 




 /u/samx3i do you believe that season 2 will explore Earth-2? 




 And for those who never watched Smallville, what exactly is that? 




 Poor Barry. Couldn't save his mom. 

More like "chose not to save his mom."
 




 Not god, grodd. 




 Dat singularity. 




 Tell that to Heatwave and Captain Cold. 




 Just a disclaimer - I love the show's CGI. I just thought this little bit here was derpy. Loved the finale though. 









 Also, do you guys think that Future Flash knew Eobard was going after Nora after young Barry was taken to safety?

One more thing, in Future Flash's timeline did he grow up with his mother? 




 Same! 




 Whoa what's a Webm and how did that download so quickly in such good quality? 




 Drew it with my index finger so forgive me for the sloppiness. 




 Didn't he say it in the pilot too 




 "Everyone is attractive"

Seriously? You're complaining on how the actors look? The actual acting makes sense but criticism on their appearance is retarded. 




 Especially Captain cold. Everything about his character down to the way he fucking talks. 




 That... Makes a lot of sense. Did you come up with this yourself or is a fact that all that actually happened because of the disconnect?

Common sense I suppose 




 Stop quoting that. That isn't an actual quote from the finale. 




 When he said, "I have to try," I totally did. 




 shooting your dick would just be painful

Implying shooting your balls wouldn't be just as painful if not more?

EDIT: Downvotes for common sense.
 




 Dear Grodd... 




 So, your sister. 




 ty 




 In the finale and at a few points throughout the season since the pilot, we see the Future Scarlet Speedster in all his scarlet red and white emblem glory.  Do you guys think that costume was CGI rendered or does an actual physical Future Flash costume exist on set? 




 Does that mean that an actual Bright Red with White Emblem costume exists on set or was that whole costume CGI? 




 Some would say it's the Reverse. 




 it's on netflix now 




 no its reference to a song
