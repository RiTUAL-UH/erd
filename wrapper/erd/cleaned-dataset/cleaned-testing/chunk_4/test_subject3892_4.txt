 Agreed. I read these years ago and just picked up the DE Trilogy again in recent months. Drizzt is the man, and really has some nice character development throughout it as well. I don't know if I'm shocked by that or not, but I guess I didn't look at it that way when I first read them.  




 I've always loved anything in the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Ravenloft, Dungeons and Dragons style. Some of them are miniseries within the series, others are standalone. 

If you wanted a good Forgotten Realms series to get into I'd recommend The Dark Elf Trilogy. Drizzt became a huge character for R.A. Salvatore and ultimately became something more than I bet he would've imagined. Each of those books has a great pace to them as well, so it definitely keeps you locked in throughout.  




 Pretty much took the words right out of my...keyboard. Couldn't agree more.  




 All phones take crappy pictures heh. But nicely done. I dig it. 




 That's exactly it. I feel like readers of Da Vinci Code aren't your typical readers, so because of the movie hype - not to mention all of the additional media hype that surrounded the "Controversial subject" - I remember this book flying off the shelf. 




 Agreed. I did this with my grandfather years ago on a Talkboy (remember? Home Alone?) To this day it is one of my most cherished memories of him.  




 It's OK friend. You have maple syrup and hockey. All's well in the end.  




 Have a pic? I'd love to see it; provided it's in an area you can show. ;-) 




 Hah that's pretty funny and from what I gather, very typical of him to do. I loved Mother Night, so I'm glad he gave himself an A for that one. Slaughterhouse Five is a classic, but I don't know if I'd rank it higher. In fact, here's my go (based on what I've read of his)

Mother Night - A  
Cats Cradle - A  
Slaughterhouse Five - B  
God Bless You Mr Rosewater - B+  
Welcome to the Monkey House - A-  
Breakfast of Champions - C  
Deadeye Dick - F  
Wampeters, Foma and Granfaloons - C  
Jailbird - C  
Galapagos - B  
Hocus Pocus - C+  
Armageddon in Retrospect - B+  
Bagombo Snuff Box - B+  
God Bless You Dr. Kevorkian - C-  
 




 Haha yeah, anything over 100K would help you break even.

But seriously, a fantastic spot for MMPB. Anything from the big names like Clancy, Koontz, Crichton, Rice, Vonnegut, etc. can be had for nothing. My girlfriend and I spent hours in there during a visit in February. The guy who runs it truly does it as a labor of love.  




 Had I read it only once I'd agree with you, but after having just read it again recently I found myself liking (and understanding) it a bit more. Sometimes KV can be a little too vague and satirical for my liking, but I found myself laughing a bit more this time around. 

That said, his style does grate on my after a while. This isn't a direct quote, but if you've read anything from him you can relate. "He put the pasta into the colander. A colander is used to drain water from pasta. Pasta is made for consumption. Through consumption humans get energy."

Maybe that's a lame example, but it's late and I'm tired. hah 




 And then there's this: http://www.bookthing.org/

By far the single greatest book "store" ever. I'm planning a trip there next month and I live 3 1/2 hours away. Well worth the trip considering the cost of gas more or less covers the books.  




 Hah yeah, pretty much. Just don't forget the gambling on horses thing and then you have him down perfectly. 




 I find humor in the sheer fact that he embraces his role, but I just can't hack his stuff. It just feels like the same thing over and over and over again.  




 Thanks, I'm not the only one.  




 Truth be told, by bookshelf is kind of a timeline of my life. While I've already stowed away the children's books for the day when I have kids of my own, the collection more or less begins with my early interest in sports and fantasy. From there, a number on non-fic books start to pop up along the lines of "Alive" and "Devil in the White City," but there's also a good mix of humor with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs as well. 

Yes, I have my one shelf devoted to Stephen King and Tom Clancy, another devoted to Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter Thompson, but for the most part I have a pretty solid, well-rounded library that I'm really happy to show off whenever someone says they enjoy reading.  




 Oh he's definitely whiny, but that's the beauty of it. How many times do we look back on life and think about how easy those things were to overcome when we were 14 - 17?  I'd take the responsibilities of 18-year-old me again in a heartbeat. They pale in comparison to those obstacles I face now, but when I look back on those moments I think of how easy they were and how immature I was to whine about something so trivial.  




 Da Vinci Code, Sarah's Key, Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Anything by Charles Bukowski, Hyperion
 




 I didn't mind Galapagos, but Deadeye Dick was awful.  




 Agreed. Not to mention the thought of having endless cliffhangers after every chapter makes me nauseous already.  




 I was just talking to a buddy of mine about this the other day. He's one month away from having his first kid and we were just shooting the ish, talking about growing up, playing video games (Goldeneye tourneys all dayyyy son), Magic the Gathering, D D, Warhammer, LAN parties for Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft II, etc. Time goes by so fast. Hang onto these ones. They'll last a lifetime.  




 God damn. That was beautiful. Salute. 




 Agreed. It's been on my list as well. However, I've noticed over the years of my browsing through the discount rack at B N (because let's be honest, it's ALWAYS there) that the translations and versions tend to vary. I'm sure it's all "in the ballpark," as they say, but for the sake of discussing it while reading I'm just curious to see if anyone knows of the best version of this classic.  




 The Stand.
