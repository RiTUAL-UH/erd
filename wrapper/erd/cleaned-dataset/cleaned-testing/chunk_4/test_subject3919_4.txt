 I once had an appendicitis and my appendix was is a abnormal place. So when it rupture it completely popped and filled my insides with a purple goo. Plus with the fact that it was in the wrong place the doctors didn't find it for almost a month, resulting in an infection and a month in the hospital where I had 8 IV's hooked up to me and was constantly in pain

TL;DR - don't underestimate any medical condition

edit: I'm also a type 1 diabetic which further complicated things

 I played BF3 and BL2 for 400+ each and loved bolth, but I would have to say BL2, I did play it solo and with a full party of friends and it was a blast, BF3 is great at first but it becomes a run of the mill game soon after

His own comment was incorrect though.

 I think what u/RaisingCain123 is trying to say is that they are finding a way to fight it. 




 That's from the movie Push. 




 I think so. Why'd they use this meme though? No one looks down on people who over tip. 




 You haven't even been a redditor for a year. They have always been porn/gore. If you want porn, go to gonewild. Don't want gore unsub from WTF. 




 Haha. You sound like a child that has been proven wrong but is too embarrassed to give up. If you're so sure I need to know you're reasons to hate a cake day post...... do tell. 




 So you don't have a response 




 Then what the hell are you getting mad about?

 Yeah I found that too at first, I learned to grab everything that was weightless, make as many potions as possible (it doesn't even matter what they do) and in your inventory there are item types you can select (like armor or weapons) and those are REALLY helpful. 




 Wow. huge help man thanks! 
I said the thing about my jaw to prevent swallowing, I saw in a video somewhere that the position of your jaw can help. 




 I think you'd love The Witcher 2: Assassin of kings. It's Really immersive and the gameplay is sweet. It's difficult at first though. It's focus really based off of the characters.
