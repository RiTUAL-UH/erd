 They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin. 




 Maybe it doesn't fit your appeal. As a legendary Apollo I think it looks nice and may wait for gem drop BUT with the free gems you can win this weekend you may only have to pay for 400. I think it looks nice. 




 Confirmed! 




 Successful trade with MuseTheGreat. Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, Ratchet and Clank: Up your Arsenal, and Ratchet: Deadlocked. Great guy! 




 League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?  




 I was ranging from about 1990-now. 




 Really cannot agree more.  









 Did it 




 They all look really really good, and sadly, no. I will continue looking but the offer for the paid shipping is still up if its inconvenient for you. 




 Actually closer to Philadelphia. I guess I'm not too familiar with the map and regions haha.  




 Just someone with a funny design like Ymir, Kumba, Ne Zha, Bakasura, etc. 




 That's fine. I was aiming about ten or below. We'll discuss the shipping and stuff tomorrow but may I see the pictures?
