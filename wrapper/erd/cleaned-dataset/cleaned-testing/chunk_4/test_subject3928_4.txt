 Go get checked. I just had a cancer scare and it was no fun.  




 I will be seeing you at the Hollywood Bowl on October 8th. Can we hang out?  




 i was sooo close to photoshopping this same exact thing. you win!  




 yeah! 




 ahhh you got me! 




 I was just in line at the bank. The guy in front of me was some creepy old guy wearing a AAA uniform. The girl behind me was an attractive Latina nurse. 

So the old guy starts hitting on the nurse pretty hard. Calls her spicy, compliments her figure and generally eye-fucks her the whole time. I could tell that she was getting really uncomfortable, and felt like I should intervene. I mean, I was sandwiched between them so it's not like I could ignore it all. So, I did what I do best: I start hitting on the old pervert. Hardcore. 

I generally repeated the things he said to her, complimented his mustache and uniform and said it would look best on my bedroom floor. I even winked a few times. I could tell this guy was incredibly homophobic and hated the fact that he was getting hit on by a guy. He did, however, understand the point I was making and got out of line and left. He even apologized. 

The girl thanked me and said she'd never seen anyone do that. I just replied that I'm always happy to fight fire with fire. 

So is this something I can get knighted for? I'd love to be knighted.  




 they do in my heart 




 great, now i'm turned on at work 




 More times than you'd think. I should also add that I owned a toy from the smash hit FLUBBER that would dance from sound activation. If I started clapping, shit would go crazy.  




 From ages 8-10 (roughly). It was great.  




 clearly i should stay off the internet. thanks!  




 got em!
