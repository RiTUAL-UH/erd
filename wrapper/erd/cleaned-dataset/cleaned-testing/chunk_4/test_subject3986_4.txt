 ah, another fellow raccoon eyed eighth grader :) i looked like a crossover between someone from My Chemical Romance and someone punched in both eyes. i wish i knew to not put dark purple eyeshadow all over my eyelid and under my waterline, but i thought i was "edgy" hahah 




 [srs] i mean she spent hundreds on the knockoffs to review them for people who cant afford a $58 UD palette. it was no different  then all the regular hauls and swatches MUA users post with their brand-name items. it was just a silly thing for people to get mad about...  




 Dang, you were SO close! North Carolina ;) 




 ARE YOU SAYING IM NOT ALREADY HIGH END???? I AM FLAWLESS, BITCH! 




 Ur harassing me! Downvote 




 Oh that makes sense! Thanks for explaining :) 




 I just ordered Lolita because you rocked it so hard!! Just out of curiosity, why are you holding a blank sheet of paper in one of the last pictures? I've seen it a couple times but I never really understood what it does 




 My music tempo affects how fast I work! If I'm listening to 2cellos (cello covers of rock songs) I work much slower, but if I listen to metal then I'm lightning quick  




 Oh my god Bang! Bang! is gorgeous but would not look good with my skin tone. So jealous! 




 Really? I have only seen spacecake once, but I guess since I'm not always on reddit I may miss the posts 









 The Borgias! I've never been interested in historical drama but this show takes the cake. Its amazing! Make sure you watch the one with Jeremy Irons (the voice of Scar from the Lion King) 




 Wow I wish I looked like you when I was 14! I was rocking the raccoon eyeliner and concealer as foundation look... I think a nice bold winged liner could really draw attention to your eyes. Also, if youre a beginner with eye shadow, just find a nice pink shade that looks feminine (not hot pink or anything hahah) and dab that on the lid for a "fresh" look, then apply winged liner. Its good for someone your age and not too over-the-top! 




 Your brows have a nice shape but they seem really thin... I would recommend looking into filling them in to give you a "fuller", more natural look. 




 Love the look, but as /u/boppitybeepboop said, just blend a bit more. And I really need to go buy one of those burts bees lip crayons! 




 Maybe its just me but I rarely ever see anyone do swatches/hauls/FOTD with a Melt Cosmetics product. I have two of their lipsticks in Blow and DGAF and they're gorgeous and perfect for the price! But I have barely seen anyone on MUA review them, which is weird because id expect Melt to be raved over because of the quality and price... 




 I listen to music and sing my little heart out! Then when I have to do my eyeliner its as quiet as a library for maximum concentration haha 




 Nah guys. She was 100% serious. Like she posted picture of her and her "besties!!!!!!!!" at school. I would be mortified for LIFE.  




 Yep! Thats what I have. Its the only Hard Candy product my store carries. There's a WalMart an hour away but I dont think its worth it for some concealer.  




 I would, but I plan on being a diplomatic translator, so ill have to enjoy the wacky hairstyles while I can~ 




 Wow! Thanks! It actually was very helpful, this was what I was thinking of :)  




 Judging by the angle their sloping at, I reckon they'll slide off her forehead any minute now... 




 Well... long story short... her 4,000 instagram followers told her she looked hideous so then she decided to go for an "editorial" look and she grew out her eyebrows and brushed the hairs upwards, which looks even sillier. So the answer is no. 




 I have medium beige skin with a slight olive undertone, and I'm really lusting over Coven but I'm not sure I could pull it off with my complexion. Could anyone with a similar skin tone comment with some swatches or with you wearing Coven so I can an idea?
