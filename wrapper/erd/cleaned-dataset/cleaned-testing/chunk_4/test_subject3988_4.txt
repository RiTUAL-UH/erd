 There are thousands of entrepreneurship blogs, forums and websites- general ones, like this, to niche ones that serve specific fields. Why is yours special?

Please realize that your question is the equivalent of asking 'I am thinking of starting a restaurant that is strictly for Greek food, what do you guys think..?!'. That's why you got the responses you did.

 




 Britain's losing ground in recent years is largely a result of its economic structure, the fact it relies heavily on financial services- an area that was obviously shaken hard by the recession. Now that we are exiting the downturn the UK is definitely not losing ground anymore, in fact it is growing faster than any other western economy, has had GDP forecasts increased and will shortly overtake France, perhaps I overestimate the rate of growth but there is little dispute that the UK will be ahead of France in the next few years. (See recent IMF reports, laid out with some quite nice graphics [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10752204/UK-will-be-fastest-growing-economy-in-the-G7-this-year.html)!)

Obviously it is more difficult to forecast economic conditions further ahead but various sources suggest the UK will lead Europe's economies. [The Centre of Economics and Business Research](http://www.cebr.com/reports/cebr-world-economic-league-table/) comes to mind among others.
On the assumption that the Euro holds, Germany drops from the 4th largest economy in 2013 to the 6th largest in 2023 and 2028. For France the drop is more precipitous  from 5th in 2013 to 8th in 2018 to 10th in 2023 to 13th in 2028. Similarly Italy drops from 8th in 2013 to 15th in 2028 and Spain from 13th in 2013 to 18th in 2028. 

Interestingly, if the euro broke up Germany would fare rather better in the analysis. 




 Huh? Are you writing this from 2002? I'd never vote for le Front National and I enjoy some of the EU's benefits, but not *even* Greece?

The fact that the euro has one interest rate that's too high for some places and too low for others has hugely prolonged economic decline and mass unemployment at one end of the spectrum and encouraged bubbles in the Spanish and Irish property markets at the other end. 

Even putting the economy aside, in the midst of their crisis Brussels made a joke out of democracy in Italy, pressuring the EU commissioner Mario Monti in as Prime Minister and *cheering* as he appointed a new government that contained not a single elected politician.

A Civitas report last week showed that the United Kingdom (I don't personally know what the deal is for other economies) has not seen *any* more trade advantages as an EU member than it would have as a non-member.

The EU has its benefits, but what you say about it being good for every country involved is just not true. Plus, the UK economy will overtake France's this year and is on a trend to be the leader of Europe by 2030, with the pound.
