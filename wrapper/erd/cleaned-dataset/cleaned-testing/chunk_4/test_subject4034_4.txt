 Hey thanks heaps for getting back to me. 
What goes on on the Sunday classes?  




 I really want to start training in Parkour, great exercise and what not. Is there much of a scene in Newy or a group or  others keen to give it a crack? 




 Does anyone know of any uni sharehouses Here? Preferably near Macquarie Uni? 




 Would anyone out there happen to know of any web development or Web design companies in New that are looking an intern or work or anything like that. 




 That is brilliant  









 Yeah its a really great place. They don't have the range that Kings have but whatever they don't have they happily order for you and it gets here pretty quickly. 
And the Owner is a bloke named James and he is super talkative but a really nice guy.
