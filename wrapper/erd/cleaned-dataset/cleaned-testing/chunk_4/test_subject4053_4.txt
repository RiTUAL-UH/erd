Nopenopenope. 

Dead people freak me out anyway and I am terrified of zombies, even if it wasn't a zombie, that would have been the first thought that popped into my head, I would have promptly emptied my bowls and bladder simultaneously and learned to fly real quick.

 Yeah, do let us know what they say. I'm sure there's a few details of the story that I've forgotten but I told it to the best of my memory, which is usually pretty good and considering that this story put me off  little black dogs for years, it's one I remember the best lol.  




 Well, fortunately, unlike some people, I don't waste my time writing fictional stories ^_^.
