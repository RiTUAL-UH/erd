 Should have closed one eye and looked at your thumb. 




 My father was great and strong. I never knew him.

He left before I was born. I only talked to my mother about him once in the ten years before she left me too.

My father's parents took me in. Grandpa was a businessman, and a good one. When I moved in, however, he gave all that up to buy a fishing boat, and hired a crew. He spent most of his money, and Grandma nearly left him.

Over the next five years we would set out for months at a time, only coming in for short a reprieve before heading back out. It was hard work, but with Grandpa there, I remember it all fondly. It seems really exciting looking back on our adventure.

On my fifteenth birthday, there was a storm. Even grandpa was taken by surprise. He lost his nerve and tried to turn back, but it was too late. A wave broadsided us and rolled the entire ship over. We lost all of our equipment that had been on the deck. Across the from where I clung to anything I could find, I no longer saw him in the bridge.

Grandpa was gone. Plucked away by the storm.

After the sky cleared, and I was finally falling into an anguished sleep, I heard the sound of water dripping on the linoleum near my bunk. I opened my eyes to find my grandpa standing there next to the bed.

"I'm glad you finally met him," he said and he walked out of my room.

My father taught me everything I needed to know about life that day. About loss. 




 He's probably over in /r/shaving or /r/wet_shavers or something. :P 




 /u/outfromtheashes is slackin', but he's trying to make a new guide for beginning writers. Basically a quick list of do's and definitely don'ts.

I don't think there's any way to have a story you write here do well without having some basis of writing. Get some fundamentals, then the story you want to tell and do it.

/r/nosleepworkshops is there for people to work on improving their nosleep stories. 




 Yeah? Look who's talking, bub! 




 What makes you think it's a Moleskine? 




 Yes! That was great! 




 That ending is awesome. I think trying to condense it into some moral lesson or something could only cheapen it. Nice story, thanks. 




 "You're so vain. You probably think this post is about you."

Music. Just music. :P

I don't see a problem if you can edit it to 274, but what if it's 1000 words and you edit and edit and finally hit... 500. Rock bottom. Then what? 




 You also can't ignore how reader-friendly it is. A 275 word story is just a couple minutes worth of time invested. Some of those /r/nosleep stories are thousands of words, not counting series. 




 I guess I might as well mention here that I moderate /r/NoSleepReruns, which is for exactly this - a great story gets posted there and no one even gives it a chance. It's a sort of recommendation sub for second chances. 




 Completely agree. That CSS makes me feel dirty. 




 Here's the thing. /r/NoSleep is pretty restrictive in their rules. It's sometimes hard to write for, because most of the time it necessitates everything being in first person.

/r/ShortScaryStories can be about anything, but there's the length restriction. That's not good or bad, it just is, and I think it definitely has its place. The only problem with it is that people are editing their stories down to 274 words to fit them in here. That's not necessarily the best thing for the story.

/r/DarkTales is non-restrictive. It's not even just Horror, it's anything dark. Maybe some people have been turned off by the sidebar. Maybe people don't know what it is.

You have to mention /r/LetsNotMeet as well, since it's basically the way that /r/NoSleep was in the beginning, and it's got 95,500 subscribers - nearly twice the size of /r/shortscarystories.

The point is, I would assume that /r/DarkTales would have the most subscribers, /r/shortscarystories would have the second most and /r/NoSleep would have the least. Not even factoring in the default status of /r/NoSleep, it's exactly the opposite. Why? How did they form that way?

/r/LibraryofShadows is as abandoned as a real library. The librarian checks in once every few months to make sure it hasn't burned down or collect the insurance money. The users that do accidentally stumble in there don't seem to actually read anything judging by the votes.

EDIT: Oops, i meant /r/TheTruthIsHere (33,000), not /r/LetsNotMeet. 




 You may be patient 4,567,003, but you're still a zero. 




 Welp, these were all the comments I needed to read here. 




 Is this it? The chosen one? 




 Boo! 




 Seven "fucks!" Fuck yeah!

Thanks for the honest feedback. I was too attached to some ideas to notice that they actually came out deformed. Good comments. 




 Thanks for having a read-through. This is the type of stuff I was looking for. 




 43,592 in /r/shortscarystories

2,780 in /r/DarkTales. I like it, I do, but why hasn't it picked up an audience? 




 So I've noticed a lot of posts that are 274 words here. Exactly 274 - one word away from that limit. It's pretty clear that they're being edited to fit.

So if you write a story that's 276, and can't be any shorter than that or it'll fall like a deck of cards, where do you submit it?

ShortScaryStories is awesome, but is there a sub without a word limit for catch-all horror writing? If not, why do you think that is?

**TL;DR:** Where else do you submit your stories? Subreddits? Websites? 




 Holy Spirit.

God the creator, resting on the 7th day.

The son, God come down as a man.

God, the myth, the communicated idea.

God's existence depends on us humans. Kill the human, kill God. 




 Nah, I think they're a time traveler like in The Time Machine. The streetlights are the old fashioned lamp ones like in pre-electric London (his time). His time machine is hidden in the woods, now out of fuel from the last jump. He's just realizing that he left fingerprints in another time when he wasn't supposed to exist, thus creating a rift and rewriting history. 




 No. Thanks. That's great, but yeah, I really am trying to sleep. 




 Wow, you actually came up with this? That's amazing. You're a prodigy. Who's your publisher? Is it hard to write when you *can't even be bothered to read the sidebar*? 




 So you can put in a good word [with them](http://sites.lwhs.org/animation13/files/2013/12/2003-The-Triplets-Of-Belleville-2003-11-960x566.jpg) for me, right?  




 Pyramids. They burn just like she did. 




 Thanks for writing the memoir of my mother for me. D: 




 He said, **"MEN DON'T HAVE THE BABIES."**

Edit: "babys" 




 Cigarettes. 




 The animal corpses did it for me.

Good to have to back writing shorts, Gravy. 




 When I was a teenager, my mom used to down a fifth of cheap booze and pass out in front of the TV. I'd sometimes sneak in and steal her still-lit cigarette from between her stained fingers. 

Then one night I didn't.

At least I've still got her brand to remember her by. 




 If you wantto collaborate with those authors, I suggest you message them directly. Check the Author Pages section of the FAQ for Facebook pages etc. 




 /r/CreepyReadings? 




 /r/AskScience, /r/HomeworkHelp and check the related links there. Not sure about the rules for AS, but it's popular at least. 




 The poor, unsuspecting public!

Seriously though? Knowing that you wrote that a long time ago is really interesting. I think you're a phenomenal writer now. This may not have been the greatest thing, but shit, you did a lot right! You built characters and layered on a plot, which sounds basic, but those are things that a lot of people just *can't* do. So all flaws considered,  It's actually inspiring that you shared this.

Thanks. 




 [Aokigahara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara) 




 That part in bold is fucking awesome. Great stuff. 




 It was the word "squirt" wasn't it? 




 Meth heads usually have rotted teeth; it's a common identifier.

Also, a trope in horror is to have someone grow an "unnaturally," or "impossibly" large smile and/or shows their sharp teeth. 




 It should have been obvious from the title, but I didn't see it coming. Get 'im, KMA! 




 I was just trying to be helpful, gosh. 




 Come on, baby, don't be like that.  




 What was that machine?

And is the ~~Grindhorse~~ Understeed coming back next year or going to another farm?

Some absolutely terrific descriptions here. I'm glad you lived to tell the tale. 




 Sorry, ma'am, Queen. I'll try to keep it local from now on. 









 I haven't told you how much I like this yet, but I do. The only thing is that I feel a little weird because I read it on my phone. 




 It's kind of weird though, because when I was a kid I played outside. I went down the block to the park and walked to school... But my kid? Over my head body is he just *outside* all the time like that when nobody's watching him. 




 Thought I heard sirens. 




 I know the feeling. I couldn't believe it when she told me that. 




 My name is Minnie, like the mouse, and Ill suck your dick if youll give me another hit. For a rock Ill do whatever you want.

But you gotta wear a rubber. Im a classy lady and I aint stupid. They all wear condoms.

Some guys try not to. There was this one guy...

Five bucks to finish the story.

Kay. So theres this guy, Mike. Mick. Somethin. Anyway, he lives down under the bridge usually. He took a liking to me after the first squirt. For some fuckin reason he was hooked on *this*. Problem was he didnt always have the money for it.

One day he shows up broke and shitfaced and tries to feed me all this shit about how he *loves* me. He starts gettin grabby and then pulls a knife, so I shoot him in the gut with Lil Missy here.

Nobody gives a shit about us down here. Get it? So nobody cared when Mikey died, least of all me.

Next night he comes crawling back - like I told you, its like hes addicted to this fuckin honey. Only... a full day layin under the bridge with a bunch of rats hungrier than him means he aint got legs anymore. Chewed him clean in half. Guts trailing about ten-twelve feet behind him and hes litrally crawling his ass back to me.

Says I love you, and I shoot him in the head so he finally lays down.

Hey.

Hey, where you going? 




 You sure packed a lot of story in there.

So Benjamin convinced this adult woman that she was his mother until Wendell came and told her that Benjamin was the same kid he'd grown up who was actually ~60 years old?

The town is kind of like Neverland, then? Where you never have to grow up.

So just one more question... if he breaks through their arms, is he free? 




 Nicely done!  




 More good ideas, thanks. 




 Ooh okay my bad. 














 That kinda sorta makes sense, but I think you're struggling to develop [ethos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion) as a writer, and most times you read it it's a mistake. So unless you already are a well-known writer with a reputation of making few errors and people are going to look for some deeper meaning, then... I'd just say follow the rules in this case. 





























 He didn't realize that there was a cut or scar? Or did they teleport it out of him? 




 Jesus fuck, man. Was the reason you had to finish it... because you started it? 




 I knew I'd seen your username before! You wrote The Itch for the picture challenge!

Thanks for the welcome and suggestions. 




 This story was off the hook, Itch. If the guy kidnapped Sophie lived nearby, maybe it was a close call? I really hope they can catch him and send him to prison, then the rest of his cals will be made on a cell phone. 




 Not all, man. Storm troopers aren't clones or they'd all be the same height.  




 Do you ever think that maybe there's another way? Like another path or road that time didn't take? That someone back in our lives made a decision, and both worlds still exist; both sides of that decision were made, but we can't see the other side?

A man showed up at my farm tonight who looked a lot like me. He had my mom's eyes, and his smile was crooked like mine and Dad's. He said his name was Bill. My brother's name was Billy, but he died when we were little.

Bill said that he was tired, just looking for a place to rest. I let him sleep in the bed and didn't pester him. Dad always said, "Best to treat others well. You never know when you might need a favor." It wasn't pretty, but it's honest.

Dad. That bastard. 

He shot Billy right in front of me when I was just ten. When I'd visit him in prison, he'd tell me it was because I was his favorite. Because I was the strongest. The smartest. Because it was fate.

Now I know that it wasn't any of that. It was just a decision.

Tomorrow, I'm going to follow Billy to the place where that decision wasn't made. 




 Dude, sometimes your puns are my main motivation to write. I just start getting that itch to hear one, you know? 




 Thanks, Itch!

Yeah. I love it here too. It seems like every time I go to /r/nosleep lately I end up writing a complaint in the OOC and deleting it.

This place reminds me a lot of the pre-default nosleep. As in, people actually want to be here. Much more positive environment.

Thanks for the rundown, though. You're all my new friends now.  




 What users post regularly here that i should follow? Got any favorites? How about favorite SSS's of all time? 




 ^ I'd put that first sentence of this post in the comments if you're worried about it. Good on you for caring about stuff like that.

Also, why is this your last story?

 I'm on a rollercoaster!  Look, no hands! 




 Thank you for reading it. You're all so nice tonight!

And yes, the *'s turn into italics in Markdown. 




 Thanks!

I'll definitely check the comma usage, and consider the timestamps.

I didn't want to beat someone over the head with a re-telling of The Krampus. It's scarier to me if it's human, just someone who actually kidnaps (bad) kids, and beats people with a stick. The title is more of a sort of lens to view the character through, and to arouse suspicion of the mysterious stranger. Maybe I tried to do too much?

What about the narration of the tape? Are there more problems than those that you mentioned?

Thanks again! 




 [That was kind of a dark suggestion](http://i.imgur.com/QyI7gt9.jpg), AFC, given what /u/Bruxism- said. Oh well. 




 [Krampus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lu_QB6Nv_ilStO4LfFW3AIDFP7z3Hte-xK_ZbOet99M/edit?usp=sharing)

First try at a found-footage style narration. I seriously want feedback on this, even if you *didn't* read it, at least if you could tell me why, or at what point you stopped.

Edit: I give bonus points for angry expletives in your comments, so go nuts. Be destructive. 




 There are some weak, info-dumpy passages that stick out like sore thumbs.

One example is a character who says out loud what their job is to another character. This is obvious to them, and it's clearly only there to explain to the reader.

There are a lot of adverbs (-ly everything). If someone exclaimed, then they did so loudly - the reader can figure that out without you telling them. It seems like a small thing, but it's one of those things that marks it as being amateurish, and degrades trust in the writer. On that same note, there are a few words that maybe didn't mean quite what you thought they did. Just trust in your prose.

I didn't read the whole thing yet, but I do like how you've layered the plot on. You're not apologetic with the unique parts of the world (magic/The Choosing/memory reading/religion) and I like that confidence.

Oh, and I found a you're/your mix-up which was inexcusable.

All-in-all, I would just say write what you know. Your ideas are pretty good, but the language is a little irritating and doesn't quite suit you yet. I think the story could have been fine if stated more simply, so just have the confidence to do that.

 




 I think it's telling you to eat her. 




 Or you could just wear flashing lights and reflective clothing. There's no benefit to being "stomp-activated" except when you're a kid. 




 The Holidays raise my anxiety level. I think that they must raise everyone's to some extent, but my therapist said that I should write down what happened to me two Thanksgivings ago. He said that it might help. I doubt it, but here goes.

It starts with Miriam, a woman about my age who worked in the office downstairs. She wasn't ashamed to show her scars. Over the top of her sun dress, they blossomed out over her shoulders like a topographical map. I did my best to avoid bringing it up whenever I saw her, which only became more difficult when she started saying hi to me when I'd get there in the morning and when I'd leave at night. The signals were obvious. She had me in her sights.

She didn't rush me when I wouldn't ask her out right away. She knew about my last girlfriend, and how it hadn't ended well. Lisa's alcoholism had gone downhill, brakes cut and out of control. I hung on, however, to hope and to her. I refused to leave, even past the point when it was obvious that nothing good could come from it. I think that in reality I hoped that she'd die, rather than to have to face the feeling that I'd failed and abandoned her.

What she did instead was come to my office with her father's unwieldy hunting rifle. Everyone I knew anymore had been at work when it happened. Miriam had probably been locked down in her real estate office like the rest of us. It's funny because we'd failed our most recent active shooter drill before that, but the police were able to stop her before she got close to me.

After Lisa had been taken to prison, I discovered that my days now felt empty. Most of my time had revolved around her while the rest of the world, myself included, had been neglected. My birthday came and went without anyone even noticing. I bought some good whiskey that night to celebrate in my apartment, but somehow drinking just dredged up bad feelings about Lisa and made me feel sick. I ended up drinking some water and turning in early.

I liked Miriam, but I couldn't see myself asking anyone to hang out anymore. What would we do? I didn't go to bars or play sports or hike or... anything. I'd let myself go physically and mentally, putting on over 40 pounds in a few months. I had nothing. More than anything, though, I was afraid that if we spent any time together outside of our hello-goodbye conversations that she'd see that. I started getting to work early in the mornings to avoid seeing her in the shared lobby. There wasn't anything I could do about the evenings, though. Whenever I got off work, she'd be there, acting like she was waiting for something else. She always left right after me, though.

The Fall season brought freezing rain that came down in buckets. It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and a long weekend was just around the corner. The potholes on the way to work were so full of black water that in the evening light you couldn't even tell what was a puddle and what was a pit. It was one of these hidden voids that caught my front tire. I felt the car hydroplane and lose traction, then catch on the broken asphalt, jerking the steering wheel in my hands. The front of the car glanced off a narrow tree, sending the world spinning. I just remember everything being *so fucking loud*... and then nothing.

When I woke up, I was in such incredible pain that I couldn't speak or even think. I felt myself sliding along the forest floor, the rain falling on my face. I opened my eyes and there was Miriam, the strain of dragging me evident on her face. "Oh thank God, someone's here," was what I wanted to say. What I tried to say. All that came out, though, was the scream like a tortured animal. With each tug, she managed to drag me a few inches, and my arms and legs would be reignited with pain.

Through tears and involuntary screams, I pleaded with her to stop. One concrete question pushed its way through the maelstrom of agony: *Where is she taking me?* I couldn't even hear the road from where I was and the only trees that I could see were far away. Looking past my feet I saw her car where she'd dragged me from. *Her* car.

The reality of my situation set in then. She wasn't rescuing me. She was *taking* me.

She pulled me up the small wooden steps which raked across my shoulders. Out of place bones in the small of my back hung up on the top steps. She yanked harder and everything fell to black again.

I woke up in a room with wooden floors and walls and just one door. I was laying flat on the floor, ropes tangled over top of me in a web. I couldn't move, anyway. There was pain when I tried and I was pretty sure that bones on the right side of my chest were broken. The really concerning thing was that my legs didn't seem to respond at all. The smell of cooking food and something foul filled the room from a small antique-style wood cookstove.

Soon, Miriam came in from outside wearing a dark green raincoat and black, knee-high rubber boots that trailed mud onto the door mat. She flashed perfect white teeth at me when she saw me looking.

"I was worried you'd never wake up, sleepyhead!"

"Help. Help me."

"Oh did you do another doo-doo? Well, I'll clean you up in just a moment."

She sounded so vapid. So stupid. LIke a pampered teen in Uggs and yoga pants talking about someone else's toy poodle. I hated her. I was fucking terrified of her, but that felt natural. The part that didn't feel at all normal about it was that I was now hyper-aware of the dozens of imperceptible things that she did from moment to moment. The way her hair was; how it smelled; how she wore her belt too high; the slight lisp in her voice that she'd trained to only come in on some words. She was too old for all of it.

She hung up her jacket and sweatshirt, and took off the boots, leaving them by the door. She cleaned me like a baby. I almost blacked out again when she lifted my legs to get the filth that had run up my back. Then she went to check on the stove.

I said before that I liked her. If none of this had ever happened, I might have even worked up the courage to ask her out. We'd have gone on some kind of a first date. Dinner and a movie. Maybe not dinner, actually. She'd have wanted to cook herself. But then I'd have tried to get to know her. I'd have looked right past those things that I was suddenly aware of. Knowing that she was some kind of psycho made it easy to call those things out in my mind - she was past redemption anyway.

This is what makes the whole thing so hard to forget and put in the past. Before this, I would never have known. She hid it, but more to the point, I was willing to trust her without knowing anything about her. Then at the end of the date, I'd have gone back to her place and I still would have ended up watching her walk across the room with a knife in her hand.

I thought that she was going to torture me, or kill me. The insane thought even came into my head that she'd slaughter and eat me like a fattened pig. She pulled out a wooden folding chair from the table and stood above me. She just stood there and looked at me, then looked at the knife then back at me and smiled and, oh God, I remember thinking that she looked cute when she smiled because tiny dimples would form in her cheeks.

"I'm so glad you could come for Thanksgiving, Adam," she said while pulling down her pants. "I've liked you for a while now, you know. You play hard to get."

I continued to watch the knife as she spun it in her hands. The blade would catch the light from the gas-powered lamp and flash twice on every rotation. The wooden handle had been dyed like a rainbow, each ring of grain a different shade. It looked ridiculous. It also looked sharp. She set the tip on the top of her thigh and spun it again. Blood ran in a bold line off her pale, scarred skin and fell onto the floor.

"What a perfect first date. I would say that I didn't expect it... but I think we both knew that this was coming. I know I've daydreamed about it before. Every day." As she said the words, she pulled the knife along her leg. It didn't go smoothly, but it went deep. The blood pooled on the floor and ran into the cracks between the boards. She waited a moment with her eyes closed before she pulled it out. Then she did a sort of shiver, like a cold breeze had blown across her neck.

I looked away then, but it didn't help. I knew that she was cutting again and softly humming against the pain of it. I could see it in my mind as well as hear the blood dribbling onto the floor. Looking away, the only change was that the smells from the kitchen crept back into my focus. Mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, yams with cinnamon and brown sugar. The place smelled like heaven and I was starving. Even through my horror, some crazy part of me wanted to eat.

Miriam bandaged up her wound and then cleaned the floor. From on top of the table she picked up a plate, the contents of which I couldn't see from the floor, then took it back to the stove.

"Dinner's almost ready," she said. "Everything else is done. I hope you're hungry. I've just got to cook this and it will be time to eat."

I couldn't say no. It hurt too much to fight and she was surprisingly strong when I tried to turn my head and close my mouth against it. The first piece I spat out onto the floor without chewing. She cried and slapped me across the face. With the next one she held the rainbow-handled knife to my throat. She took a picture of my face as I chewed, the plate on the floor next to my head, the thick strip of her cooked flesh sitting there lifeless and sluglike.

She took more pictures on her iPhone, and fed me more. There were five pieces, but it felt like it went on forever. I tried to throw up when it was done, but nothing came. There was nothing left in my stomach to throw up. Miriam sent and sat in a stuffed chair which faced away from me after that for a few minutes. I didn't care to see what she was doing during that time. Then she fed me the rest of my dinner, asking me at least ten times if I'd had enough. After cleaning up, she laid a sleeping bag out on the floor next to me and kissed me good-night.

"Thank you, Adam. Happy Thanksgiving."

I laid there awake for an hour. A whole hour with just silence and pain, and my crazy thoughts whirling around in my head. Splashes of red and blue lights appeared on the walls from the front window, then the police came through the door a moment later. As they were loading me into the ambulance that one of them chuckled and said that "It smells amazing in here." 




 Is this... for this subreddit?

Is there a code? 









 [Good advice? What are you doing here?](http://i.giphy.com/5xaOcLOmvJEKIOpOSe4.gif) 




 Kill it.

Sending this stuff in a PM is awesome. Saying "This scared the shit out of me and was so well written," seems fine. Playing along and asking about the story is better.

But just replying to "The thing covered in human teeth and nails came out of the forest and ate my family," with "This is the greatest thing ever!" is not so cool for a place like this. 




 It gave me an Indiana Jones vibe. 




 Congrats for getting back into writing. Don't stop! 




 "Beef bike! BEEF BIKE! Why aren't you stopping?" 




 I mean, still harass them, but at least have a safe word or something. 




 I *was* wondering.

Hope you're feeling better,  though, seriously. Interviews can wait until you're healthy and have less going on. 




 I second what you said about Death Agreement. /u/StealthFiction was on some other level when he wrote that one. 




 Try /r/threekings. 




 Because they couldn't cross [humans and dinosaurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2nfdrs/jurassic_world_could_have_been_worse_the_original/) like they originally wanted to.  




 shit me to tears

Wow. 




 [Ooooohhh!](http://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/chris-pratt-gif-2.gif) 




 Afraid or not, you should have told someone where you were going, Dr. Jones. 




 Payback is a itch. 




 A bit of pink lace hanging out of his briefcase. Those were the first pair that I found.

We used to fight about it back then. I think he enjoyed the fights almost as much as he enjoyed *them*. He liked knowing that I knew, the crazy bastard. He liked that power; the feeling that Id never... do... *anything.*

But then he started bringing his girls back to the house with him. *My house. My bed.* I couldnt take it listening to their screams and moans coming from the room.

So I tied him up. 

Thats it; its all I had to do. I tied him to the bed one night and left, pushing my way past the grisly, shadowy figures streaming in - the ghosts of the girls hed killed, come to reclaim their peace. 




 You need Pocket.

 13 hours in and 13 points. I'd say its front-page dreams are over.

Too bad, too, because it was a pretty interesting story. 




 Thanks for pointing out what was "special" about the notebook itself.

You know what you can use on the go? A tablet with a stylus. You don't even have to take a picture of it that way. 




 I want to apologize, but cant. The guilt of losing a piece of my towns history is burning a hole in my gut, but its not something that I can just talk about with them. Its not something that you can just bring up in casual conversation.

History can be a powerful thing in the wrong hands. A persons reputation controls them, and in a small town like mine, their history defines them. The antidote then, is to control your own history - to keep evidence, to continue remembering.

I lost a video tape, one of those little ones that fits inside a portable camcorder, and now I cant even apologize for it... but maybe I can make up for it, even a little. By sharing it with you. This piece of history, uncut, unaltered: the truth.

The tape begins in mid-November, 1993. Peter Smith, 8 years old at the time was given the camcorder by his uncle for his birthday. The first five minutes or so is mainly made up of the kind of stuff youd expect an 8-year-old to film; clipped conversations, awkward shots of family members half out of frame, people singing happy birthday where the camera cant decide where to focus because of the dim lighting of the candles.

Without warning, it changes to the inside of a cramped apartment. Childrens toys and clothes scatter the floor. Peter is doing a fake newscast in his bedroom. His sister Nicole, just five years old, does a convincing impression of the local weatherman, capped with a back to you, Pete!

Together, they belt out a breaking news theme, trumpets, drums and all.

Their father bursts into frame. Keep it down! he hisses. Your mother is trying to sleep!

Peter, frozen on camera, looks mortified. He suddenly seems very out of place wearing his fathers tie over his Power Rangers sweatshirt, blond hair cut into a 90s bowl.

Nicole speaks up. But mommy sleeps all the time! We never get to do anything anymore!

Peter leaves his seat and steps out of frame. Randall, their father, crosses in front, kneeling down to hug his daughter. Just before the tape transitions again, you can hear him say, Shes sick, baby. She-

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family is packing boxes into the back of an orange and white moving truck. Dad, can I keep the camera out and film this? Peter asks from behind the lens.

Sure, champ! Randall is loading a box labeled clothes into the truck. Hes smiling. Its obvious that some time has passed since the last scene, and seeing him now is a huge contrast to last time he was on the camera. A blue plaid shirt stretches across his broad chest. Hes grown a beard, and the new look suits him well.

Where are we going daddy? Nicole asks.

Oh, baby. I told you, were moving to Oregon.

Ory-gun? Why?

The cute factor of this five year old is killer. Shes adorable. Long, dark hair hangs down nearly to the bottom of her puffy, dark blue winter coat. The coat forces her arms out from her sides, and a pink beanie with a frilly pom-pom tops the whole spectacle like a cherry.

Were going to start over there.

Start over? Like Noah?

Randy smiles widely. What do you know about Noah?

He put all the animals in his art and there was a biiig flood, and then the sun came out and God gave them a rainbow. Then they started over.

Thats very good, honey. And youre absolutely right, were going to put everything on our ark, he gestures to the moving truck, and were going to start over new.

Is God going to give us a rainbow when we get to... to...

Oregon?

Yeah, Ory-gun.

Maybe hon-

*-clip-*

The tape skips again, for several minutes, Peter films out the window as cars and brightly-colored signs fly past. He quickly pans, showing his sister in the carseat next to him, and his mother, Quincy, driving. The orange moving truck can just be seen ahead of them through the windshield.

*-clip-*

Did you get it? Did you get that?" Quincy asks. The camera is moving all over the place. You can hear the belt unbuckle and Peter points the camera out the back window of the car. Auto-focus struggles and then settles on the rain-covered glass.

No! I missed it, youve got to go back!

I cant go back, Pete. Its okay, though.

Nicole starts crying.

No mom, weve got to go back and film it. We have to!

Were not gonna make it to Ory-gun, now! Nicole wails hopelessly.

Nicky! Nicky! Its okay! Were *in* Oregon. We just didnt film the sign at the border, thats all. Its alright, now calm down.

Peter mumbles a Sorry, Nicky, before shutting the camera off again.

*-clip-*

You see Randall and the kids in a hotel room with two queen-sized beds. McDonalds happy meals and wrappers are on the tables. Nicole is squealing, jumping on the beds. She looks like shes never had more fun.

Dad, video tape us! Peter says, and hands the camera to his father. After a few fumbling seconds, it turns to show Peter now in place on top of one bed, his sister on the other facing him across the divide.

Ready? Peter says. Go!

The two jump. Peter easily clears the gap, doing a bellyflop on the other side, but Nicole lands on the hard edge of the bed. She starts crying and Randall immediately sets the camera on the bed, facing the wall.

The door bangs open and as Quincy comes in from outside the room. Shut up! God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, Randy?

Sorry, Quin, we-

Shut her up. Shes going to wake everyone in the fucking hotel.

Hey, cool it, Quin. Please?

Im going to go finish my smoke. Pete, its time for bed.

Mom!

Ssshut up! Just shut up! Jesus, all day long with you and... she trails off and the door slams shut.

Nicole and Peters sniffling is the only thing you can hear for a a few seconds. Randall breaks the silence. Its okay. Youre okay. Lets just get ready for bed. You know what tomorrow is?

We get to our new home? Peter asks.

Thats right, and were going to start over over there, remember? Things are going to be different. I promise. Okay guys?

Okay.

Now lets go brush our teeth.

The camera stays on, ignored on the bed next to the wall. When the kids have come back and are tucked into bed, Nicole asks, Daddy? I dont think mommy likes me. I dont want her to come back.


Heyyy, Randy says soothingly. Mommys going to be okay again. I promise. Remember how she used to play with you all the time? Remember before... before she got sick?

No.

Well *I* remember. And you know what? Shes still your mommy, and shes part of our family, so we love her no matter what. And I love *you* no matter what. And you too, mister.

Love you too, dad.

The front door opens again. Quincy sighs, Finally.

Hey... Quin, can we talk?

Randy, Im fucking tired. I really dont need to hear it right now.

Come on, Quincy. Just... You promised youd try this.

I am trying. What do you call this? Moving hours away from everything just because your friend is selling his house?

Sh! Lets go outside.

Fine, but you say one thing about your new pal Jesus, and Im gonna...

Just... Youre going to wake the kids. They dont need to hear us like this.

The door closes and though the voices start off muffled, you can hear that Quincy is shouting. Eventually, Randy comes in to go to bed and turns off the camera.

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family has already arrived at the new house. Peter is running outside while making motor noises with his mouth. Nicole is sitting on the porch steps, organizing her pink Barbie backpack.

A white, two-story house sits in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by tall evergreens. A hand-made garage and a gravel driveway that leads to the main road are the only other things in the grassy clearing. Dark clouds hang low over the house.

Peter steers onto the large front porch, through the front door into a furnished living room, catching a glimpse of his parents sitting at dining room table, then barreling down the hallway and out the back door. As he runs beside the porch again, his father calls his name.

Youd better come in! It looks like its going to rain out there!

Aw!

Wheres your sister?

I dunno!

Nicky!

They continue to call and look for her, checking behind the garage and in all the rooms of the house. Quincy joins them outside, hands stuffed into her pockets, dark hair blowing wildly in the stirring wind.

Where could she be? Randall says, returning from the driveway. I mean, she couldnt have gotten far, right? I knew we should have gotten the phones hooked up sooner.

I think she left, Randy.

What? No. She probably just...

Its happening again, Randy. Shes so quiet that the turbulent wind very nearly swallows her words.

Quincy, its-

We lost her!

We didnt *lose* her. What are you talking about?

Fuck you, Randy. You know what Im talking about. Quincy goes inside, leaving Randall staring at the empty space that she just occupied. Snowflakes have started falling in force.

*-clip-*

Peter and Randall are in the car, making their way down a narrow gravel road.

Dad, where are we going?

Were going to go into town so we can get the police to help us find your sister.

Trees are blurring by on the both sides, the gravel path winding between them. Snow has fallen in the areas where the branches above are sparse and flakes are starting to pile up on the windshield.

The gravel driveway drops down a final steep incline to find a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Randy slams on the brakes, and the car skids in the soft wet gravel.

What? Randall says.

What is it dad?

I dont know...

Is that a person?

Randall opens the car door and crosses in front of the cars headlights. Peter is pointing the camera through the window onto the road, but its impossible to see anything there in the gathering darkness.

Randall jogs a short way, then suddenly stops and raises a hand to his mouth. He bends down and scoops up a shapeless black form. Zoomed in, the camera is shaking in Peters hands.

Get in the back seat, Pete, he says through the glass. Randy opens the door and lays the dark mass in the passenger seat. The camera zooms out and another mans pale face comes into focus.

*-clip-*

What the FUCK are you doing? Who the FUCK is that, Randall?

I found him on the road. Hes hurt, but I didnt see a car or anything.

And you just *brought him here?*

The roads are closed going both ways. The trees are just blowing over everywhere. Every few feet another one is down.

Jesus, is he even breathing?

Randall carries the tiny man over to the couch in the open living area, in front of the wood stove.

And what about Nicole, Randy? Did you see her?

Im going to keep looking. I dont know how long I can stay out in this weather. Ill try to get through to the neighbors houses, at least. Maybe she just got lost and went over there. Its going to be fine.

You- youre leaving me here? With *him*? And what if he wakes up? I dont believe this.

Pete follows his father out onto the porch with the camera. The snow is falling so thickly that the little shed not 100 feet from the house is completely obscured. Wind blows audibly on the microphone, creating a hiss.

Stay here! Randall shouts at Peter and points back into the house. He disappears into the flurry. Peter takes the camera back inside, and films the falling snow through the window.

Nicky.

The whisper is just barely audible.

He turns toward the living room. The black-clothed stranger is lying there on the couch, unmoved. Peter comes in close with the camera, putting it right up to the mans face. It looks contorted, like hes snarling in pain. Rigid, scraggly hair clings to the mans chin and cheeks, tapering off as it rises to the mans spotted, bleeding scalp. Black scabs the size of Snapple caps adorn his head. Purple lips and sunken eye sockets lend to the mans overall shabby, sick appearance.

Nicky.

The camera is pointed directly on the mans lips. The thin purple lines take up the whole frame. They dont move, but you can clearly hear the whisper.

Nicky.

Peter! shouts Quincy from the stairs behind him. Upstairs!

She catches him mid-step as he flies up the stairs. You dont go near that man again. Do you hear me? You stay away from him.

*-clip-*

From the top of the stairs, the camera points down on the front door and the dark living room. A few glowing coals remain in the fireplace. Randys jacket is still white with snow. In the dim light, the camera has difficulty finding something to focus on.

What are we going to do, Randy?

Its out of our hands now. He looks exhausted, bedraggled. His jacket stays stiff as he hangs it up on the hook. Shes in His arms. Im going to pray now, and you can join me if you want.

No, thanks. Thats your department, but Ill send a letter to Santa, just to cover our bases.

What?

To Santa. Its a joke.

Wh- How could you say something like that?

You know... I think its like you said, maybe everything is going to be alright now. This could be a fresh start for us, baby. Quincys blurred form is moving closer, slowly.

Quincy, if youre trying to... mock me, this is really not the time.

Im not mocking you, Randy. Im being serious. Im sorry. For everything, I mean. When Olivia died, I mean... Things were bad before, but that just broke me. It was too much.

Randy hugs his wife and gulps back a sob. It was somehow worse, though... because there was still Nicole. They looked so much alike, do you remember, Randy? Do you remember all the little twin outfits and matching bows and shoes? And after she was gone, all of it was double. Extra. It killed me that I couldnt get rid of it, or throw it out. Because I still had *her* and we werent really allowed to move on.

You can see that Randall has pushed himself free of her arms now. He holds her at arms length.

I know you didnt want to listen when I told you this before... But I know she killed Olivia.

Shut up.

I know it. And having her there all the time, it was like living with her ghost.

Stop it, Quincy.

Now shes really gone, dont you see? It wasnt *natural* for one to be here without the other. We finally cleaned the slate. We can start over, now.

Shut the fuck up! Damn it, Quincy, it was an accident! Just stop it!

You know, I never forgot what you said when you first came home that night.

Dont.

What did you do to my daughter, Quincy? What did *you* do? Wheres *my* little girl?

Youre an alcoholic, Quincy. You were depressed - you were sick. Thats... Youre sick.

I dont feel sick anymore Randall. For the first time I can even remember, I feel... fine.

A curdled scream from the old man shakes the air and startles Peter who runs back down the hall and into his parents room, locking the door behind him.

Hes awake! Randy yells from the other side of the muffled bedroom door.

*-clip-*

-ome down and meet him. Now, he hasnt said anything yet, but were going to take him into town as soon as the light comes up. You and I are going to have to cut some of the trees up, you think you can help me with that?

Okay.

Great.

Randall looks like he didnt sleep at all the night before. His hair sticks out at odd angles and his face is pale and sagging. Even his smile looks weary.

Down the stairs, the man is sitting at the table with his back to Peter as he approaches.

Um, sir? Randall ventures. This is my son, Peter. Sorry, hes into video taping everything right now.

The man turns slowly to stare through the camera at Peter. Chewing, his mouth works side to side like goats. Then he turns back, and methodically takes another spoonful of oatmeal.

Well, want some breakfast, champ?

Wheres mom?

I think shes still slee-

*-clip-*

Pete, already in the back seat of the car, watches as his father carries the skeletal form from the house. The sun is coming up, and even though a thick layer of snow covers the ground, the placid rain is beginning to thin it back down.

Slowly this time, Randy maneuvers down the gravel driveway.

Skid marks, he says as they reach the road. Look at that. Right there on the edge of the bank. I couldnt see them last night in the dark. Hold on a second, Im going to take a look.

Randy jumps out of the car and jogs across the highway. Peter zooms in. He turns around to say I can see his car! before he drops over the edge of the embankment and out of sight.

He zooms back in, and pans from side to side, scanning the road for his fathers reappearance. He stops as he notices that the old man has turned and is watching him with a vacant expression.

Do you know Nicky? Peter asks in barely more than a whisper.

The mans lips spread into a smile, revealing long, crooked teeth rotted and black at the gum line. His eyes dont leave the camera and Peter. He just stares and smiles.

The car door jerks open and Peter is pulled outside. Randall is back.

Dad! Dad, he knows something about Nicky!

I know.

Randall is clutching a pink backpack in his fist. With quick movements, he opens the trunk and exchanges the backpack for a wood saw, then moves around to the passenger door.

You son of a bitch, he says as he drags the man out by his coat collar. Unable to support his own weight, the man drops helplessly to the ground. Peter, get back in the car. Stay there. Randall drags the man by one leg over the embankment again and out of sight.

For a long time, Peter just sits in the car. You can hear him breathing.

*-clip-*

He turns the camera on, pointing down the road heading South and leaves it on for about thirty seconds before shutting it off.

*-clip-*

Theres some kind of noise outside the car like thrashing in the brush. After about a minute it goes away, and Peter turns it back off.

*-clip-*

Randall walks back across the road. There are no signs of the old man or the saw.

*-clip-*

Through the rain-streaked window of the house, Peter zooms the cameras focus on the point where the gravel driveway enters the woods. You can see his breath forming fog on the cold glass.

Dad, theres someone outside.

One broken headlight and half the silver grill of a huge truck just peek around the tree line.

What? The curtains move as Randy pulls them aside for a better look above the camera.

It looks like its crashed.

Yeah, it does. Maybe they hit one of those downed trees or something.

How come theyre not moving?

I dont know, Pete.

Seconds tick by.

Im going to go out there and see if theyre okay. Just stay here for now, alright?

Okay.

Randy opens the door.

Dad!

What?

Im scared.

Its okay, champ. I promise, okay? I love you.

Love you too.

Peter points the camera back out the window, and Randy pulls the door quietly shut. Soon, he steps off the porch and into the frame, walking toward the truck.

He freezes, squinting ahead.

He turns to run back to the porch. A sound like a cannon fires from the truck, rattling the windows, and Peter drops down beneath the window. His breath is ragged with panic.

The camera creeps back up to the window. Randall is there, lying face down in the mud. A red spot is growing on his lower back. His arms are still moving, groping, but he isnt able to drag himself. Hes reaching for the window - for Peter.

The auto-focus is shifting from the window to the curtains to Randall.

From the truck, a bear-sized man in a black fur coat takes a few limping steps into the clearing toward Randall. Hes carrying something like a 4x4 in one hand, propping it up over his shoulder.

The bear man whips the wood down through the air like an axe onto Randys skull. Peter drops down behind the window again, struggling to contain his crying.

You can hear the thumps from the club in a steady cadence, and then everything falls quiet. Even the rain pauses.

Irregular footsteps sound on the porch, then a knock at the front door, but Peter doesnt move. The doorbell sounds, pressed but not released, *ding*...

The knob slowly turns and the weather stripping creaks as the door cracks open.

*dong*

Peter sprints up the stairs. The sound of the doors glass panes shattering is drowned out by a roaring scream that isnt human. Peter bolts straight ahead, opening his parents bedroom door, and shutting it behind him, placing his back up against it.

MAMA! He screams and drops the camera.

Bare feet hang next to the bed, a few feet off the floor, a chair kicked onto its side underneath them.

The door frame splinters, and the camera is knocked under the bed, plunged into blackness.

Peter goes silent in an instant.

The sound of the killer beating him and his mother goes on and on.

The rest of the tape is of the dark, which eventually goes to blank. The whole thing is about 45 minutes long.

*Was* about 45 minutes long.

The Smiths were discovered by Ronald Preisler, still technically the owner of the house, the following day. Hed met Randy through a church conference that theyd attended together.

The car found in the woods near the base of the Smiths driveway could not be traced back to a registered owner. It was assumed to be owned by Benjamin Burns, a career truck driver whose body was found nearby, hacked to pieces with Randall Smiths wood saw, and bearing signs of blunt force trauma not consistent with a motor vehicle accident. Burnss truck was reported stolen after the fact, but was never recovered.

The body of Nicole Smith was discovered to be washed nearly a mile down a nearby stream. Hair and blood samples place her in the abandoned car near the time of the crash. The handles on the insides of both rear doors appeared to have been torn off. They were not found inside the car. However, when it was recovered, it was found that the latch was damaged in such a way that the door could not stay shut or locked.

Quincy Smith was found in the upstairs bedroom of the house. The time of death estimated to be several hours before her son Peters, whose body was found in the same room. While his cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma, hers was shown to have occurred prior to the trauma her body underwent.

Randall Smiths death was the only one thought to be a mystery, since he was charged with the murders of his other family members and Benjamin Burns. The cause of death was said to be the gunshot wound. The subsequent marks of trauma were said to be post-mortem, rendered by some unknown passerby who came across the scene.

The video tape was never entered into the police file or as evidence in the investigation. I got it almost two years ago, now. I nearly destroyed it the first time I watched it.

Instead, I hid it away in a box of video game cartridges. A box that was recently donated to a Goodwill in the next town. It wasnt there when I went to look for it. Ive gone every day and asked, but they keep telling me that they dont have it, and if they did, that someones bought it by now.

Im unbelievably sorry. But I cant tell them now. 




 Finally, the voice of reason. 




 'Ti Tuga digga tu Gi Friba fligugibu Uh Fligugigu Uh Di Ei Friba Du Gi Fligu fligugigugi Flilibili Ah Fligu wene mamamana Lucifer! 




 Gotta re-write the whole thing. It was in this weird tone, too, so I'm not even sure I can capture it again. 




 I wrote the best story ever...

And I didn't save it. 




 I think everyone goes through times like that. Not saying that it's not true for you. Every time it's happened to me, though, I come across something where I least expect it that wakes me up... at least for a little while. 

Anyway, intent is important, I think. Whether or not you went for the ride, ask the question of what they wanted it to feel like to read their story, and you can usually make the determination. 




 Is it going to keep you up at night? If yes, nosleep.
