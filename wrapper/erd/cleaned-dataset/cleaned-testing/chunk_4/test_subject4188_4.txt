 Poor Ivy Pepper, she will have to play with her plants again tut tut 




 Ah whatever, Couch Tuner again then 




 Also, where the heck is Ivy, are they ignoring her for another season, she needs screen time god dam it 




 Not keen on the likenesses here, it seems that someone forgot the photos and went by memory 




 Imagine not getting let in somewhere then flashing an FBI badge 




 Fox won't allow UK residents to view their site 




 Will the new mini series be shown on terrestrial TV or Sky / cable in the UK

The original series had aired on BBC / Sky 1 but what about the new series? 




 I sure hope they remove that stupid delay between the US showing episodes months before the UK receives them, you'd think nowadays that most countries would get things around the same time

Also, when will season 2 air in the UK ??? 




 I feel The Riddler should be on even level with Pengy in season two but they're still showing him as secondary  




 I know this was sung briefly in the cell by the old woman in an episode in the first series but I wonder if the full "I used to give her roses" will feature on an episode soon

Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new

It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters 




 Would be great to have a few cameos from those who were in Cell Block H

They should have Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart / Home   Away) back as he was in the original as Geoff Butler / Ernest Craven / Kurt Renner 




 Gordon looks bloodied, you think he would have taken Falcone's offer and had a vacation by now, maybe Bullock finally had enough of him lol
