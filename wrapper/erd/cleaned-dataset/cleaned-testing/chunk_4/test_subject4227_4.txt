 You're absolutely right, and you are making some fine points. I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just presenting a view that agrees with Christian beliefs that I feel is better than the average Christian argument for the problem of evil. The most common answer I've heard is that "it is beyond human understanding." And you're right, this is a non answer. All I'm saying, however, is that if you're going to present a non answer to the problem of evil, then you might as well pick a good one based on logical proofs and arguments. This is better than just stating that humans cannot understand God in my opinion. I'm not presenting this as a solution. I'm not presenting this as my opinion. I was just trying to point out that Leibniz has a pretty good theory that coincides with Christian arguments and beliefs. That doesn't mean that it solves the problem of evil. If it did, then nobody would use the problem of evil as a criticism against God and monotheistic beliefs. Leibniz presents a logical argument that allows the problem of evil to be circumvented while still maintaining the integrity of God. If you disagree with it, then that's fine. If you want to say it's wrong, then you have to find a fault in his argument. I'm not leaning one way or the other. I just thought that monotheists might want to take a look at Leibniz's theory to help them argue their points. Everyone knows that it's hard enough for them to explain themselves without relying on the bible or faith. I'm not saying that this view is of any particular moral worth either. It is simply an explanation of why there is evil. Another major reason why God in Leibniz's theory can't make any less evil is because how time and space work in the creation of the universe. Like I said, Leibniz's discourse is a good read, and it will explain his theory better than I ever could. If you don't want to take a look at it, then that's fine. It will expand your mind and your opinions though.  




 I disagree. I think that it's fine for them to have faith, but that shouldn't be a cheat code used to end philosophical arguments when things aren't going their way.  




 You should read Leibniz's Discourse on Metaphysics. It spells it out much clearer than I did. I'm not saying that it's the best view, but it is a complete theory that isn't based the idea that God created good and the devil created evil. It actually provides an answer. And essentially yes, this is the best possible reality or universe that could have possibly been created. You can't know that though because it is beyond human understanding. If you can poke holes in Leibniz's argument, then I would be very interested to hear how you did that. Otherwise it's just another competing theory. I could care less one way or the other though because I'm agnostic. I was simply stating that Leibniz has a pretty solid answer to the question of evil that coincides with what Christians believe in. It was merely a suggestion that Christians should adopt this theory, or a different complete philosophical view, in order to argue this point. To me, this is better than shouting bible quotes or using circular arguments. This at least a theory that I can respect because it is based on good logic, and Leibniz was a freaky genius guy that that makes his argument pretty strong against criticism.
