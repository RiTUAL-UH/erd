 Btw, how can I get the mario flair next to my username? I just acquired it in-game
 




 Oh. :/ 




 I think it would make my game run a lot smoother.  




 How do you run it without the new textures? 




 this is why i'm subscribed

 I was thinking about that being a possibility. He said his head starting ringing, I thought that happens when you get hit in the temple.

Plus, OP isn't responding to any questions or comments.  




 When is reddit going to remove the asses over at /r/GreatApes? I'm more than sure they downvote brigade in default subreddits.  




 I totally get that.

He's bleeding internally due to injuries sustained from her kicking him in the stomach though.

That means his organs got messed up. That sounds like an emergency room visit. 




 Half the stuff on this subreddit it complete BS.

This guy got kicked so hard he was bleeding out of his mouth and he decided *not* to go the the hospital?  




 So she kicked you so hard you were bleeding out of your mouth?  

Then you didn't go to the hospital?  

I'm calling BS. 




 Because it's a lie.

TIFU is full of them. 




 I'd drive through Austin cackling with glee!  




 Thank Jingus there's a veto ability. 




 Vote.

Tell everyone you know to get off their butts and vote!

33% turnout this last cycle lead to this BS. 




 I'm frugal. I went with Chromecast. I haven't had any problems. 

Sorry I'm not as financially secure as you.  




 ITT: Paid Amazon shills.

 




 It's not you man. It's everyone else that already has the damn flair. 

Edit: Oh, and the 15 minute bullshit.

 Uh... GO GET TESTED YA DINGUS!

 Meh, it was okay.  




 I, too, frequent /r/ofcoursethatsathing 




 The 2013 one stiffed him.

His SS from December got him a gift and he received it today.   




 Thank you for telling me about /r/games. I'm peacing out of this POS subreddit.  




 I've only seen the movie once but I can look back on it and imagine this theme! 

It's also a common theme in a lot of movies now that I think about it. Like Interstellar.  




 Haha, no problem! I'm glad you enjoyed it! 




 Hey! There are probably some men out there that enjoy it.  




 Is it the food? I love food in movies.  




 My favorite part is the acting.  




 Have you ever seen [C is for Cookie?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9rzMaAucI4) 




 It's been awhile since I've seen it! I remember my favorite seen was the autopilot.  




 Morgan Freedman has such a way with words man! Unbelievable.  




 I'll start: The Shawshank Redemption

My mother and I would watch it together when I lived at home, it's her favorite movie.

 I read it as 'stupid pajamas' and I thought "You are heartless!" 




 I started to realize that as I was typing. Yep, passing down the stupid.  




 And too bad kids aren't bright enough to realize that it's not 'one person's' fault. 

People should be blaming their districts.  




 I don't know how to say this nicely:

Too bad. :D 




 Neat 




 Vacuum cleaners. I've never seen one blow.  




 Arma 3 Altis 




 What did you use? 




 Which one do you recommend? I've been tinkering on codeacademy.com, is that a good one?  




 Yay! I'm so glad you liked them! 

I'll be frying some up tomorrow. I got a craving!  




 How? I'd like a change in career.  




 I have one too, I've made like $3 and I can't cash out until $100.

It's been over a year... 




 Here is the recipe!  

http://cavemanketo.com/crispy-wings/  

If you're trying to cut back on fat, then baking would be best.

I'm on the keto diet so I'm just trying to limit my carb intake and let me tell you, I fry chicken thighs this way and I can't believe how crispy they turn out! 

 




 I find that cooking the broccoli helps more.  




 I do it over the stove, I think if you're using a deep fryer you use its lowest setting first (like 280F) and then crank it up to high (380F?) 




 All I get are pictures of Gary Oldman 




 "Blue" "Waffle" 




 Try the twice fry method:  

14 minutes on medium heat   

3 minutes on high heat   

They come out like breaded fried chicken. I'll never eat them any other way.  




 I've got this weird gut issue where if I eat too much raw broccoli I won't digest it and end up pooping chunks of raw broccoli.

 




 I was having a discussion with a cab driver while abroad in Mexico and he flat-out asked:  

"All black people are evil, right?"  

And just turned the question on him.  

"Are all brown people evil? Are all Asians evil? No? Well that's your answer."   




 brb, buying a cucumber 




 When the one close to me was new it was super slammed. It's best to go at lunch.  




 That place is awesome.  




 Why couldn't TIME use a how-it's-made? 

'Reverse engineering' in a video is weird. 




 The delicious explosion of Totino's Pizza Rolls. 




 I would've like to have read it that way but there are subtitles... 




 And so it begins.

Watch faces were popping up on /r/fallout and soon enough that's all the posts were... watches. 




 Every time he wins I cringe.  




 I thought you were funny! 




 I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels this way.  




 I think it was just a good guess. No way he'd quote what we all saw. That's unoriginal. 




 Now let's get Matthew McCaunghahay to narrate it. 




 Karma pls 




 I have never liked them because I felt like there was no effort in making the conversations work. 

This one is the best I've seen *because* he put effort into making the conversations work.  




 Dude, all that rhymed! NOICE 




 Hahaha, never had that problem.

I'm glad you're jerking yourself off about this.

Feels good man. 




 Ohhhh, gotcha. I appreciate the explanation! 




 Wow, you must be in a fraternity (or you are 10) having said that last line.

do you only hate the guys that stole your college girlfriends? 

Just in case you delete it:

Clearly no one wanted to rush you....Greek life is a club like any other. Do you condemn a soccer team with the same fury, or do you only hate the guys that stole your college girlfriends?   

-/u/zerorules  




 JUSTA PRANK BRO!  




 And so it begins. The downfall of greek life.

 




 Gotcha! Wait, so when buzzfeed makes an article about reddit posts, they are violating copyright?  




 Then what should I gather from this?

I got a little mixed up, not 'TOS' but 'User Agreement' 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe this says that OP doesn't own his content once placed on reddit; reddit owns the content. 

So no, not public domain. My bad. 




 It's a site wide rule. 




 Ha! 'Legal protection'

Once it's on reddit it belongs to reddit.

You should read the User Agreement sometime. 

EDIT: fixed some incorrect information.  




 He was soliciting his story. Basically trying to make money off of it. That is 'self-promotion'

Make sense?  




 Can you ask him what he did. I've searched all around and haven't found a solution even when searching "AMD Rust fix". 




 Can I get two slices of cheese between two meat patties (no bun) for $2 at the other chains? Hell nah. 




 Awesome, thanks! 




 Give me your address. Them fightin' words.


(Don't really give me your address)  




 Why can't I watch the theatrical release of Anchorman 2? The only one I see on Netfilx is the extended edition which completely sucked.  




 Anyone know what the limit is? 




 I have a friend with the same card that doesn't have any issues. I believe that somehow it configured itself to use my CPU instead of my GPU to render everything. Like it didn't think I had a dedicated GPU. 




 The game ran completely fine before the experimental version came out. After that it has been super laggy. 




 I think this will be the last game I ever purchase in Alpha. 




 I have an AMD Zambezi 6100 CPU running 4.1Ghz and a Radeon HD 6870 GPU

I cannot run this game in legacy or normal mode.

I did not have problems running the game before their overhaul. 




 Sources please. 




 Not a bad thing to not be.  




 We'll support a fetus until it needs support .

We'll support a troop until they need support.  




 Google Hangouts for iPhone lets you. 




 Him and Colbert tore it up. 




 Damn, that was powerful 




 Nah, this is bullshit. 




 Pics or it didn't happen. 




 And video games make kids violent. 




 Uhhhh... The dude on the right is white. 




 I don't believe it.

No person in their right mind would fuck a puke dick. 




 Boooooo 




 Mac? 




 Man, when I see 18 wheelers block lanes I give them a thumbs up.

I didn't know it didn't help. :/ 




 That makes sense. 




 Me either! 




 Yeah, I don't think I ever learned that! 




 Well shit, now I've learned my lesson.

Thanks for the tip! 




 I haven't. I stay away. 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/search?q=yogurt restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all

We get it. This is just like those damn peanut butter posts. 




 Holy shit. 

121 went down to one lane a couple of weeks ago (where it enters Garland) and there were signs for miles saying "left lane closed ahead".  

We get 500m from where the lanes merge and what do you see? A bunch of assholes getting in the left lane to cut people off at the end.  

I placed my car between my lane and the left lane to stop them and all they did was drive in the shoulder to go around to be stuck at the end.  

I don't get it. 

EDIT: Looks like this isn't the proper, efficient thing to do! Don't be me; don't be wrong. 




 My worst enemy.  

5 years ago I went into a Firehouse Subs and asked for the hottest sauce they had.  

The man handed me this sauce.  

I placed a crap load on my sandwich, ate it all up with minimal tears, and left the store.  

That's when it hit me. It felt like Bruce Lee was in my stomach trying to kick his way out.

I drove to the nearest dollar store to pick up some pepto bismol and I felt James Bond drugged (from that scene in Casino Royale) as I walked to their bathroom where I proceeded to puke.  

  




 I hate Jake! I can't see him as a tough actor. 




 It was so surreal. 




 Oh, I completely agree! I enjoyed the loud. It made me feel like I was there. 




 I believe a lot of people were bitching about it being so loud.

I think it was loud on purpose. Like when Michael Cain's big reveal is practically inaudible due to the sound? Yeah, that might just be the director trying to convey how you would feel if you heard that. You hear the truth and then nothing else matters. 

Or the shuttle taking off? SHIT FLYING INTO SPACE IS LOUD... 




 WHAT ABOUT INTERSTELLAR!?  




 Damn, you got me. 




 It has? I looked at the app today, this feature wasn't included. I downloaded an update and it's there. 

Do you mean they've been developing it for a couple of years? 




 ? 




 Thank you! 




 Fix it? 









 Mainly mean stuff. It's funny to see their responses.  




 No. Never. Not with those godawful pun hints.
 




 mirror? 




 The creator of this content certainly does. 




 What is it!?
