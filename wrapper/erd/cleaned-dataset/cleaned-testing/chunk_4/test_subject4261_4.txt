 Then the police got him for vandalism. 




 All I have to say is... 2.0 




 I once had a dog that ate spiders. 




 I hate when I've got a cup of coffee from a Starbucks or a Wawa or something, and the coffee manages to consistently spill out of that tiny fucking hole, every step I take, resulting in my hand burning all the way to my car. Gets me every damn time. 




 What kind of person are you? 




 Before you posted that, did you even think about all the Jewish and Catholic jokes that are told every single day, or all the jokes there are about Mormons? I mean there's a musical comedy on BROADWAY about the fucking Mormons. Muslims aren't special. Why should Islam be the only religion that people don't make fun of? Is it because they'll bomb us if we do? That should never stop people from making fun of something, and the Muslims, especially the ones committing these heinous acts need to be taught that the world doesn't revolve solely around them, and they have no right to impede another person or groups of people's freedom of speech. 




 Oh wow... the moon. That was so 1969. 




 That's because this isn't from the same movie. I just thought, "hey look, this one sounds real." 




 This scene from LotR has hooves that actually sound right. They're riding on dirt, and guess what! It sounds like they're riding on dirt! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9K7fueW4Bk 









 Like half the dwarves die bud. /u/goodbye9hello10 




 They behave in the exact same way in the books; Gandalf, Aragorn and Legolas all seem relatively invincible, a fact which is compromised for by the apparent weakness of the Hobbits and other men. 




 On the AP calculus test last year, I was asked to find a slope and so I drew a mountain and a man dressed to hike saying "look, we've found the slope." Later on in the test, I also outlined a dollar that I happened to have in my wallet. Not that it pertained to the question, I just had a feeling by then that the test had gone awry. Needless to say, I got a score of one. 




 how about 553? No more republic, only empire. 




 YES! I've heard that before. It's so good. 




 Just an FYI, I discovered this while I was in Normandy. I was sitting there in front of a cafe, being all American and when my pizza came out, I was bamboozled. There were no slices, just a great circle of pizza. Being the American that I am, I simply ripped junks off of the pizza and ate them. After my meal, I looked around and realized my mistake. Everyone that was eating pizza around me, from the British guy next to me, to the French kid next to me, were eating their pizza with a fork and knife. 









 I know. I'm saying in the future. I should have said that the Aldmeri Dominion's territories are in open rebellion. All except Cyrodil. 




 Guess he's got the dirt on everybody. 




 Avast is my favorite
 




 Make it into a war. Skyrim, Elsweyr and Hammerfell have gone to war with the Altmeri Dominion, there is a resistance movement in Cyrodil, and now they are invading the Summerset Isles. A small portion of the Summerset Isle is a war zone. Then you can travel to certain areas in the Cyrodil, Elsweyr, Hammerfell and Skyrim. Kind of ambitious, but with next gen graphics and consoles and computers, it could be done. 




 Pursuit of Happiness. Always. 




 What is it that makes you a liberal?
