 Well in the long run it's better deals. Last time I was there I spent around $500 but I also got an Xbox so there's that 




 Yeah no kidding. Costco continues to save me boatloads of money  




 Thanks for the advice. We switched when we introduced rice cereal and it's been great 




 So do you mix a days worth of formula in it, keep it in the fridge and then microwave bottles of formula?  




 Well we've been using the Kirkland for a while. He's doing great with it and my wallet is thanking me 




 My son is just over 5 months. He's rolled a couple times here and there, and not crawling yet but socially, he's amazing, he will sleep through the whole night, and we've started him on rice cereal a little while ago and he eats like a champ. He's not breastfed anymore because the wife wasn't producing enough so it's formula until he gets real milk and food 




 Damn you brought back some memories with this one. I forgot about this show 




 You gave me an idea, mixing fruity pebbles into waffle batter  




 He still managed to instill fear into Republicans. My dad saw him on TV and immediately said that he's pure evil.  




 Call the pound or animal control. When I was younger our neighbors never controlled their dogs and would try to keep them in the yard but if they got out "oh well". One time they got out at night, got into our yard and attacked our dog. He died in my arms on the way to the emergency vet. Fuck people who don't keep their dogs on a leash 




 Which 3DS is that? I have a zelda one but it doesn't look like that  




 This is what I'm excited about. If I can get 24tb in my media center PC I will be immensely happy  




 Dude I'm with cracks open a Monster at 5am every day. We're not OTR so all our stops are within an hour drive and he buys something to eat or another Monster at about 7/10 stops every day 




 The ultimate gardening truck  




 TIL Heck is my own personal Hell 




 yes

Most android phones have nfc chips in them where you can interact with other things by tapped them. Most common is paying using your phone or tapping two phones together to transfer videos or pictures 




 There was too much fluff in the article and I found myself skipping around  




 Add in an nfc chip so I can connect by tapping and I'm sold on something like this. I've been using an audio cable for my old ihome for shower tunes 




 I just got the update. Now the wallpaper won't pan at all 




 What do you want to talk about? I do some things here and there in my spare time. A quick look through your post history tells me we both have much different tastes.

 I know that feel 




 I'd also like am answer to this  




 Tips will be great though. Sorry if you're BoH 




 I'm getting an error 0 accessing the images  




 That's one of the examples I've tried. For some reason I can't get him to not focus on the steering wheel.  




 My question is will it support the categories I've created for my subscriptions?  




 Yep, reiterated this a multitude of times and he still cranks it

 Won: my limbs look fit and muscular
Lost: beer belly, the hair on my head thinned out at an early age, and my facial hair is patchy and coarse so I can't even grow nice facial hair 




 Thanks, this actually helps a lot.  




 My company insists on hiring schmucks without CDLs and then waiting for the several month process of them failing the written test two or three times, then waiting the month it takes to get the driving test scheduled and then them needing to retake the driving test 3 times. All of this is because being 6 hours away from the bakken oilfield, they can't pay enough to hire guys who already have their CDL. 

I agree with you. If the person I'm with doesn't already conceptually get how backing up needs to happen, I don't know how to help them. I'm trying not to be too hard on him because I basically was in the same boat as everyone else except I had my learner's permit when I was hired and having only little experience backing trailers up, I picked up on it quickly and I passed my driving test the first time just like with my written test 




 At my current resume job I've been tasked with showing a guy with his learner's permit the ropes of driving. My truck is the only truck in the fleet with an automatic transmission (fuck you, it's also the only one with working cold air) so their thought is to send some newer people with me on my route to get used to the trailer before being tossed into a manual truck. My route is out of city so there's also less traffic to deal with. (but honestly fuck those guys I learned on stick floating gears).

 Anyway, the first guy they had with me was great because he had already driven with trailers and had no problem backing up to docks. The most recent guy however, can't wrap his head around backing up at all. Constantly turning the wrong way and is practically at a 90angle before he pulls back forwards and tries again. I understand that not everyone picks it up as fast but this guy makes me want to pull my hair out. The only way I can get him to back up straight into a dock is if I give him step by step instructions on how far to turn the wheel, and for how long, and I don't feel like it's possible to learn that way but if I just let him try to learn from his own mistakes he just keeps making them and then getting frustrated and repeatedly slamming the brakes too hard and flooring the accelerator to pull forward. I've tried giving him every pointer I have and it doesn't work. After next week he's someone else's problem, thank fucking God. 




 It seems like Verizon is always the last though  




 Married person here, some shows my wife wants are non existent and I tell her to deal with it, we are both aware we won't always be able to find some things we want this way. It works just fine 




 Now let's see how long until Verizon gets it 




 There are many better pizzas everywhere but it doesn't stop me from occasionally indulging my inner demons 




 Frito pizza sounds disgusting but I'd eat this. Disappointed to read it's in the land down under 




 Free Monster with every .1 btc bought  




 It would be more accurate to say hot girl moves in with you rather than next door 




 Fuck, I thought nobody would notice 




 Reddit is fun is still my favorite reddit app 




 Stores and warehouses have more space for rotation. Home freezers are basically 3D Tetris to fit everything in 




 Kitchens generally go through product faster, have walk-ins that are easier to ensure rotation, and use quicker use by dates for product just to make sure it's not spoiled. I don't have an iPhone, but to me the draw is basically using it as a freezer inventory app. How many times do people go and rummage through their freezer and either proclaim they don't have any food and end up getting fast food or buying what they already have or finding something that has been there since the freezer was first plugged in five years ago?  It's a little but easier for upright freezers but chest freezers it's common to have stuff get buried and I think that's where this app can be most useful, knowing what's in it without digging it up.  




 I don't get it 




 I know, sounds awful doesn't it?  




 I've delivered to some places where the walk-in was like how you described, no special door to hold the cool air either, just a standard door.  




 The app is great. Much better than looking up the website if you're already out. 

If they want to push to get more people using it, they should try updating it more often. It hasn't been updated in over a year. While useful, it looks outright ancient. A material design update for Android would be amazing

 I love this. Can we keep it?  




 In America we have things called automobiles and they allow us to transport ourselves at twenty times the speed of your standard horse and carriage  




 So assassin's Creed basically  




 Get a paternity test brah 




 Yeah I can see the dish washer is being held closed but why is there a washing machine?  




 Cat looks like it's taking a shit in the thumbnail  




 It just affects people differently. I used to work with a guy who was only in a good mood if he came to work high. Not only was he in a good mood but he performed amazingly and would be one of the most helpful dudes in the kitchen. If he came in not high, he was cranky as fuck and always got frustrated and messed up dishes because of it  




 I'd buy him a drink 




 Don't forget that the nemesis system isn't as active and evolving as the ps4/xbine version  




 Yep. I bought an Xbox One assassin's Creed bundle at Costco for $329... The same price as all the black Friday deals. The only one better is getting a $50 gift card from Target but it's nothing worth waiting in that huge like for. Skip the lines, buy at Costco 




 Would you prefer a YouTube video with a 30 second it to, music added to the entire length of the video and someone who keeps turning the camera back to their face for way too long far too many times? I think vine is the perfect no-fluff way to show what's going on.  




 I KNEW being poached was a real concept. I'm a delivery truck driver now and one day when I came out of a store two guys got out of their vehicle and approached me. Basically wanted to poach me from my current job, asking if I liked my job and telling me the benefits of theirs (but the yearly wage starting out would have been 10,000 less than I'm doing now). But whenever I talked to anyone about it and use the word "poached"  they kinda cocked their head and gave me the deer in the headlights look 




 This town is so small, if they even have a health inspector, I don't think they'd even know what NSF is  




 It's all extra from the summer lol 




 It's for the bakery/deli in a tiny general/grocery store in a tiny town  









 That's amazing  




 No worries, your pizza stone will continue to work just fine, it just now has some assembly required. I've been using a split stone for over two years with no ailments  




 Fellow Markiplier fan! I can't believe he teased us by playing the whole game but then waiting to do 10-20 mode!  




 It's the extreme temperature change. Even if you did put it back in quickly, that was basically two quick temperature changes. Consider getting a peel  




 That last point is one of my biggest peeves. Almost all the time I see pizza stones being sold with a special wire rack to use it for serving. So many people think "oh that's great!" without realizing how awful that idea is 




 Exactly what I did when mine broke. I still use it and it broke about two years ago 




 Yeah it was painful  




 The issue with playing PC games on your TV from the couch is that many games aren't optimized for playing from that far away. Text being insanely small being a big problem  




 Keyboard shortcut to cycle through subtitles and off is L

 Yeah shitty posts like this really get on my nerves 




 I asked this last year and didn't get any responses. Unfortunately you'll be hard pressed to find anything online ever since some new deal happened to put it on some sports channel and not be able to just pick it up on a local channel with an antenna

 How fucking big are those slices? Quart bags work perfect for me with two slices  




 Which is why Giant Bomb always recommends against pre-ordering games 




 Grocery unions don't do anything.  




 My wife worked at a library. They had constant problems with people peeing on the books.

 Your name looks familiar, are you WarLorax from the WarLorax forums?  




 I have 8 gigs on my media center and for some reason, I regularly get Windows bitching at me to close shit to free up memory. All I have open is Chrome, XBMC, and a couple other programs, nothing I would think would use up so much memory aside from Chrome's memory leak 




 My hot chocolate: peppermint hot chocolate mix from Costco and a shot of creme de cocoa 




 Fuck 




 I'm betting your name is Michael  




 This is exactly what I do. I still have quite a few on my front page but there are things I don't need on my front page  




 The multireddit is the best feature. Before it wasn't really an official thing, but you could type in /r/comedy+jokes+dadjokes etc and it would combine them into a single page before. It's nice to basically create several "front pages". I have one for local subreddits, one for gaming, and one for diy subreddits.  




 Why is this getting downvotes? Is nobody really interested in a meet up?  




 I had a feeling where this was going once you mentioned the beard 




 I always upvote darude - sandstorm when someone asks what something is 




 I'd recommend both in either categories. But I hate it when there are live bands at the hauf. That place is way too small to have everyone mic'd up 




 
Not the dishwasher, the washing machine there 
 




 Yep, digital hoarder 




 More music to add to my halo Playlist, awesome!  




 More like bromance 




 Not just similar to game play, but it used the game engine. The ones in anniversary are prerendered 




 Unless you plan on deleting as you watch, you will need more space. For comparison, I download, 720p for TV shows and 1080p for movies and I'm using 9 out of 12tb 




 Is the music redone for the anniversary edition? I didn't think they would do that too 




 Obama's AMA 




 The Charlie meter kept going up the ear the video went  




 Same here, but oddly enough I watched Volume 1 last night. Too bad netflix only has 5 




 His YouTube channel is awesome too. He does a series where his son makes every decision on what and how to make dinner  




 I loved that bit  




 I came for the viking badassery and stayed for the viking space program  




 I don't always watch for the comedy. I watch games that I'm interested in but not enough to buy them  




 Thanks, Satan  




 I don't know if you have kids, but if you don't, try to put yourself in the shoes of some of us who do. Ever since my son was born in July these kinds of posts are suddenly everywhere to make me paranoid of something happening to my 4 month old son and run my feels through the blender 




 The problem isn't really the indexer, the problem is a lack of dedicated uploaders. The majority of all anime posted on usenet is done by one guy. If you can't find something on fanzub, there's a pretty good chance you'll have to torrent it

 Just make sure to keep an eye on those animatromics  




 I like the actual "kodi" part of the most voted one but not a fan of the weird green ribbon around it  




 Oh man I remember that happening all the time back in the old days of halo 2. I'd have a group of friends in our party and one guy would always end up on the opposite team  




 I can't help but wonder how much piracy is really going on per capita than there used to be. Services like Pandora, Spotify, and Google Music are making a huge selection of music readily available at a reasonable cost (if you're paying for premium on Spotify or Pandora). I myself used to download all kinds of music, but having the access to a huge library of music that Google music has from home or anywhere really makes it worth the money for me to have. Now I don't have to deal with syncing music libraries or using up an obscene amount of space on my phone.  




 I'm not against the forehead ones but I've used the ear ones my whole life and my family has never had problems with them. Do the forehead ones work past infanthood? I don't want something I'm just going to use when he's a baby, I want one that can be used for years with everyone in the family. The only reason I ask is because every single one I've seen says "baby thermometer" in the title 




 Unfortunately Costco formula comes only in one size: bulk 




 My wife and I have a bad habit of losing those tiny digital thermometers and besides, I grew up with an in ear one so I think I should get one for my family. The only issue I'm coming across is that it seems every one has to use those disposable filters. The one my mom had never needed anything like that and it worked perfectly fine. To me it just feels like a cash grab, keep making money off of something that is a one time purchase. My mom's thermometer has lasted for over 24 years and I'd like one that will last me just as long without needing to still spend money on it. 

If the filters are absolutely necessary, can anyone fill me in as to why? 




 We've been feeding our 4 month old anti gas Similac because he gets pretty gassy and had a mild case of colic in months 2 and 3. When spending $60 at Costco for 2 containers of Similac (which lasts about 2 weeks with how much he currently eats) I couldn't help but notice the Kirkland brand for almost half the cost and bigger container size. Does anyone have any experience with their formula?

*update* we've been using it for about 3 weeks or so and he is doing great with it. Even coming from gas relief formula he hasn't had any issues with the switch. We're also using the Dr browns bottles which are great 




 Traffic was at a standstill going West a couple miles out from Columbus around 830 this morning. I sat in it for an hour before it got going again. That fucking sucked because I was making deliveries to Columbus and it put my day right in the shitter 




 That's a shitty plan. Straight talk is the way to go  




 Well Portal 2 is coded by a talented and experienced team. Minecraft in comparison was written by a single guy and it was an accidental success and after that it's just a few guys coding it.  




 Something that disappointed me was that your pet goes from being a legit party member in your group in Origins to being a simple ability in 2 









 Well the intention is for it to be a laptop replacement so the keyboard is an obvious buy 




 Thinking of an i7 surface and it looks like you can play a fair amount of games and stuff like photoshop, but I'm wondering about minecraft too as it is poorly optimized and I can't play it on my current laptop without overheating it. 




 Editing tags for TV shows is still cumbersome and requires you to go to the tags screen and then to add shows you have to scroll through your entire library of TV shows not already in that tag in order to find what you're gonna add 




 My circle of friends like to call it Skin Soup  




 He's so hot he melted through the bed 




 A moon in the background would also be a nice addition  




 I just don't understand the hate for the app. I've been using it for years, it really is quite a good messaging app 




 I second a layered coat. If not, another option is to wear a hoodie and then a light rain jacket over it to keep the wind away as well as keeping your hoodie from getting soaked if it rains or snows. Gloves are good too to keep the hands dry when you're scraping ice off the windshield. As for myself, I skip the hooded coats and wear a mad bomber hat or beanie 




 I thought this was familiar. I expected to see the video was posted in 2013 but much to my surprise it's new 




 Okay but I gotta go to court tomorrow for my DUI and then the next day it's my turn to watch my kid and my ex lives 2 hours away so I have to get permission from the police to drive that far from home and then next week I'm going to a music festival that I got some sweet drugs for that I need to use 




 I thought that was my job 




 I don't think we'd all fit but I'm sure all of us together would make a pretty kickass restaurant  




 I just bought one because I didn't know what was a good brand. My hands get dirty at work so I figured the coating wouldn't last very long 




 The one I got said there was an anti fingerprint coating on it which was complete BS because it smudged the second I went to use it  




 I use it with a tempered glass screen protector for screen protection.  




 I'd love to use that but it seems that everyone's solution to the IR blaster except for supcase is to just leave the power button exposed which is an awful solution for my small hands 




 Muzei on android with the reddit extension is great for this. Let's you also dim the pictures and add a blur so the picture doesn't dominate your icons
