 Erm, how so? How does one live lavishly on minimum wage? Or did I miss a sarcasm / tag? 




 Agreed. From the other comments, the show would need to be about millionaires who inherited their wealth.   




 Hahaha... riiiiight 




 That is a really good point. Completely agree! 




 I guess the point would be to have them help others of their own volition, rather than having them help others "because it's the format of the show". Then again, there's no telling how they would react once they get their money back. 









 Yeah, absolutely. The knowledge that they'd be able to go back to riches would indeed be the weak link in the show. 




 That's why it's a 'Crazy' idea I guess :( 




 Hahaha that they are! 




 Interesting - I'll look into it more. Though from the description of the show it seems like the donation seems like the more key feature, which I don't particularly like :\ 




 I like it! 




 Hah! Yes! 




 Agreed. Was going to say a year originally, but that may be too harsh (and impractical to film). 




 Me too, but hey, in the USA most them are millionaires at the very least. They'd be eligible to be part of the show anyway :D 




 They would also be cut off from their own house(s), car(s), etc... but instead given 'average' lodging and vehicles comparable to what minimum wage workers make. 

Edit: The people on this show would be either politicians or millionaires who inherited their money - people that worked for their fortune wouldn't be a good fit. 




 Yes. So much yes. 









 I came here to post the same info. Thank you! 




 Would subscribe. Let me know when it's up :D
