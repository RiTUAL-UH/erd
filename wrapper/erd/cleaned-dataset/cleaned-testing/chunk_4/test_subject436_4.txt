 The Euro is at historically weak levels (not exchange rate-wise, but credit and solvency) due to some boneheaded decisions made by several countries in the Euro zone. They're not going to move to the yen, so in fact this will make the USD even stronger than before. 




 Spying is a little like masturbation, everyone does it but you might want to seek help if you're doing it constantly.  




 Maybe it's because the US knows as soon as Iran gets a nuclear warhead, suddenly Israel will be like "AHA! Look at all the nukes that we have too!" The two governments are total shitheads, so they will for sure escalate as close as they can to war if not actually into one. I'd like to give the US some credit and say that the cat is already out of the bag for Israel's nukes, so they're just trying to prevent it from getting out of control in the region. 




 what's wrong with terminator seeds? they are ecologically superior if you're an environmentalist, and most farmers buy seeds every season anyway.

 Great explanation. China's banks are fundamentally capitalist too - why would they buy debt that nobody wants or is of uncertain quality in the medium to long term? They already have enough on their plate managing the debt bubble in their own country.  




 Inability to export these Russian assets will be their Achilles heel. It's really hard to shut down oil and gas wells, so if they have not enough people to sell to then they will have excess supply problems.  




 Do you think that Russia could make up the difference lost from sanctions through rising gas prices and diverting exports to places like China? That's a pretty tall order. Fortunately, as Russia participates pretty strongly in the world economy I am optimistic that sanctions will have a huge effect in the medium term. But it will be several years before Russia feels the pinch.  




 It's just kind of odd that if having refuge is essential, why didn't Monsanto/other GMO companies just spike it in themselves from the beginning? That way farmers can't cut corners. 




 Also, how could you even make a good plot with a character like Deadpool? There would be absolutely no suspense or character development. 




 Seriously, I don't think people understand that the only reason why the USSR lasted so long was because it heavily relied on stealing resources from its satellite states in the eastern bloc and beyond. Russia seems strong in the short term, but they would get economically curb stomped in the next 5-10 year range. 




 How much of that death rate do you think is due to disparities in health care infrastructure? What happens if someone in a Western country got infected with it? 




 Christianity is the same way -- there are large numbers of small Christian "sects" in America that disagree vehemently with Catholicism and many of the major Protestant groups. 




 It depends though. Lots of supermarkets have shitty tasteless ones that aren't even ripe. 




 Are they still good if you throw them into some (pre-cooked) oatmeal? Like would I break my teeth? 




 Donut/Saturn peaches are kind of odd though -- they get mushy incredibly fast and then they get way too sweet to eat. 




 I turned 30 a few months back, and still feel pretty young. Granted, I have a long-term girlfriend and we're probably going to get married in the near future, but seeing my college friends get married a few years back and popping out kids is kind of unnerving. 




 Also, if you read the article it says that the store revenue increased by only 2% but yet net income doubled because he fired everyone. That's always the first thing that anyone, especially if they work in finance, will do as a reflex but the question is does he have a long-term growth strategy? 2% increase in sales is pitiful if you consider that other chains (eg. fast casuals like Chipotle) are growing like gangbusters. 









 Did you even try to Google it?

 I don't have a good link for this, but on the PBS Nature series they specifically show a type of crow that collects tools. 




 To be fair, there are also many examples of de novo resistance, eg. point mutations in the target site (I think rifampicin is an example).  




 there was a lab working on it in California. I heard they lost NIH funding and had to scrap the project.  




 Fun fact: there is a lizard in the California/Southwest region that is also a target of ticks. But the lizards have something in the blood that eradicates the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and helps fight its spread in the region! 




 I think people don't really understand what this means and where antibiotics come from. The vast majority of antibiotics and drugs are derived from Streptomyces/Actinobacteria, who excrete these naturally. Most of these bacteria express the resistance gene in tandem so that they don't die while they are producing it. Therefore in most cases a resistance gene *by definition* will exist. These can get passed by horizontal gene transfer (eg. phage or plasmid). 




 Also, generally people who have type 2 diabetes are older folk who are prone to being stubborn about lifestyle changes. 




 I think that ~50 billion would probably be enough to give every single HIV+ person on the planet ART for free for the rest of their lives. Do this for along with promoting safe sex and you'll probably have a good shot of eradicating it in ~50 years. 




 Honestly -- just bring up some clips of the show on Youtube. It is an awful, cheesy, superficial but fun mess and I don't know why people are expecting anything different. 




 I'm 30, thought the trailer looked great! 




 There were already multiple gulf war conflicts before 2003. Was the point then to finish up some loose ends or to deals with a "WMD" problem? Nobody was ever honest about it, and even if they indeed had them, invading should have been the last thing on the table instead of the first.  




 Interpret this how you will because there are a lot of sides to this, but in WWII the standing policy was to bomb to rubble every German city over 100k in population. The eastern European front was equally bad. Major cities in Japan suffered the same fate. Most people don't talk about itin the USA, but if you go to even a tiny German town there will usually be some kind of memorial or exhibit showing how they painstakingly rebuilt literally everything brick by brick.  




 I don't know... it's kind of fun but it just makes everything taste sweet rather than flipping flavors around. 




 Actually, it's pretty accepted that there is a strong genetic component to pair bonding in humans: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97287/ is a brief snippet (a bit old). 




 Those Camrys... they will literally last you a quarter of your life. 




 Russia may be an oligarchy, but the moment that Putin tries to "nationalize" the industries is the day there will be a coup. Putin's legitimacy is solely based on a social contract between him/oligarchs and him/Russian citizens. If he can't deliver on the jobs or money and tries to take it for himself, the entire country will turn into a shitshow. 




 The cheese on the pizza can get pretty nasty of you leave it out for too long.  




 Also, China isn't an idiot. They can see that Russia has huge long term problems as compared to the rest of the West.  




 Exactly right. It's like if there was a science scandal and everyone saying "well, I guess I'm going to try homeopathy now." 




 well for one thing, you can actually avoid shooting at civilians instead of bombing a whole building.  




 They probably have enough capital to start some new factories by now.  




 Easy -- the life would be highly divergent than anything we have seen on our planet. Even through the panspermia theory, the genome sequences would still be really different than anything that exists on Earth. All organisms on life are generally well conserved in terms of the essential genes, so you would just compare these elements. 




 Another great reference is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire:_How_Cooking_Made_Us_Human by Richard Wrangham. 




 Regarding the cooked steak thing: Richard Wrangham has an entire book on this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire:_How_Cooking_Made_Us_Human 




 They are already taking off, but not in the ways you expect. they are doing well in business applications that require record tracking. or even in things like boarding passes.  




 It won't really solve it, but at least the "new states" from which SoCal is stealing water could at least extract revenues. At this point they don't even have good negotiating power but the tables could turn if each of these "states" were given equivalent powers as every other American state. 




 I'm not totally familiar with the situation and how the proposed state lines are drawn, but there has been a lot of bad history with regards to SoCal/LA and water rights. Entire communities have been destroyed because of water being diverted to LA. 




 How the fuck is this kind of statement upvoted? Most Jewish people, especially in the USA where 40% of Jewish people live, are not religious zealots (ie. "the chosen"). 




 Squab is fucking delicious. Better than duck! 




 Generally, the order is Farmers Market  Garden  Canned  Store. Why is the market one better than your backyard garden? Because they know how to grow the tomatoes properly and not in a tiny patch of dirt without proper nutrition or fertilizer. Also the sunlight is probably better in a field. 




 I feel that once you get up to the $15-40 range, then the actual variety of grape starts to come out a lot more. There's a lot of diminishing gains after that and you'd just be paying for the scarcity (eg. made in small batches) and high costs due to lack of scale. 




 I agree- the important data is not one number but the general trend.  in this case it would be important to look at the dose response curve.  




 Godzilla. What the fuck was that. He's on screen for maybe 20 minutes. His first fight with the MUTO in Hawaii cuts half way through and all of a sudden they are going to SF.  




 I love the jersey cotton sheets from Target. A lot of times the "high thread count" doesn't really mean anything since the "regulations" on that are incredibly lax. 




 Given that this guy has written a review with such a provocative perspective, it's likely that he currently has a lot of promising data that supports this hypothesis and will publish shortly. I just browsed his CV and he's definitely not an academic lightweight. 




 It's so stupid, because the police should know that they are only maximizing their risk to their own lives by entering with guns blazing! 




 People like to generalize way too much about what people should do with their hair. People have greasy or dry scalps all because of genetics. Sure, the shampooing matters but I think the important thing is to do things that your body is comfortable with. For me, I had the itchiest greasiest scalp. I would be breaking out with huge pustles on my head. People were telling me left and right to use this "natural" shampoo, to shampoo it twice a day, to not at all. What ended up working for me after literally 15 years of greasy head was Selenium Disulfide. In Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength. After that, I decided that whatever people told me to do was bullshit and if it wasn't working to try something else until it got better. 




 Bingo! Philanthropists don't give their money away for free. They want organizations to be able to match it with their own fundraising. That shows that the people on the receiving end are competent. 




 I'm not sure how it's counted in HIV, but in cancer, generally "cured" means you died of something else other than cancer. 




 My two older sisters are almost exactly one year apart in age. I try not to think about it. 




 Should have seen the look of anger on the guy's face. There were literally no defenders back there when Brazil scored. 




 Given the state of proteomics technology (with regards to sensitivity and specificity), I would take any results about "number of genes" with a grain of salt. You're naturally going to miss (a) rarely expressed genes, and (b) small proteins that will be lost during the prep. Shockingly I haven't seen many studies done that try to map proteomic data with transcriptomes (eg. you could make libraries with promoter bashing and do an analogous thing with RBS) to figure out the detection response as a function of gene expression. 




 GRRM also said that the TV show will never be exactly the same as the book. He's also happy with the way the show turned out. Let's face it -- TV canon and book canon will become different things, and that's not a bad thing. 




 They are cryotubes. Pro-tip: don't be cheap and buy shitty ones. Your samples will thank you later. 




 A lot of specialized "hard" work pays a TON of money. 




 China is also fortunate to be able to study other countries' developmental histories and not to make the same mistakes. Case in point: today, the US is winding down its dependence on foreign oil because of shitshows like the Middle East. China is doing the same thing, but they're doing it because they've watched how other countries have turned out over the years. That's not to say they have their own very substantial challenges, but they're definitely punching above their weight. 




 Give China some credit -- for such an environmentally dirty country that is still developing beyond their manufacturing base, they sure spend way more than anyone expects them to towards alternative energy and clean manufacturing. 




 I think a parallel case in point in the USA is the oil sands in the Dakotas. The entire country got hit hard by the recession, and then these jobs started picking up in the region. If it were not for the energy sector, the area would become a literal shithole. It's not such a black and white issue -- I think a lot of people are extremely lucky to say that they can choose to prioritize environmental conservation and they should continue to do so, but the real question is should we ask those who do not have the means to do the same thing? For a lot of people, paying off their house and having food on the dinner table vastly outweighs the oilsand environmental damage. 




 Not sure why you're being downvoted. I think people don't have such a black and white view of things, but rather rank them in their own personal hierarchy. To many people who live in an impoverished country, mowing down trees for natural resources and products and jobs would not be a bad thing. Sure, it screws them in the long term, but they are starving today. They've decided that the benefits of industry outweigh the environmental costs. Many people in fully developed countries will disagree with them (myself included), but I can totally see where they are coming from. 




 not true -- if you are at a teaching hospital that works on your disease you can try to push the people there to enroll you in the stage 1 or 2 trials as soon as they start. way less than 10 years. 




 not sure why you make the oral route such a big deal. there are many drugs that are delivered intravenously,  especially in cancer treatment.  









 Pajama pants and a tshirt means she's comfortable! And if she's comfortable she's happy. If she's happy then she's way more sexually appealing. 




 OMG. Perfect timing for my story! Me and the gf went to the Columbus Zoo recently, and they had a little turtle exhibit. Lo and behold, they were getting it on. A dad and his kid strolls by and the kid excitedly exclaims "Dad!! What are they doing?!" and the father replies "...... well, what do you think they are doing?"

"I think they're wrestling!!"

"Yes, that's exactly what they're doing!"

Cue the turtle on top giving a huge O-face. "Dad, that one's so angry he's screaming!!" 




 Not sure why you are being downvoted. Obesity a huge medical issue that is really, really hard to fix with exercise. Lipo would go a great way in reducing other types of health problems, improve long-term patient outcomes, and improve self-esteem! High amounts of fat are also known to cause huge hormonal changes too so IMO it's a great idea. It's not the ultimate silver bullet, but it will go a LONG way to improving health in this country. 




 It would be utterly fascinating for plastic garbage to settle on the ocean floor, just like dead dinosaurs of eons ago. I could imagine future expeditions looking at sediment layers and really doing a WTF. 




 The crazy thing about ART and Truvada is that children are now being born without HIV, and babies born HIV+ are now starting to be cured. There is a great window of opportunity to have an all-out application of HIV drugs across the planet -- we can then contain its spread and it can literally be wiped out in a generation or two. We can't say the same about many other unvaccinated diseases. 




 But how do you contrast this with the rise of the hipster generation in the past decade? They are ironic about everything. 




 I think the main problem is that the technology's not really there yet. Unlike cancer, there's not a huge foundation of biomarkers and proposed mechanisms to build on. The ones that we do have, though, are somewhat inconclusive/have low effect size/not completely predictive. Today, at least with cancer you could sequence and find mutations that could be clinically actionable. I think the best thing we can do is try a similar approach, but instead of looking for mutations we could look at gene expression changes that could be druggable. 




 There's no shortage of disposable labor to deal with that kind of material in the more sketchy parts of the world. 




 I got an S5 literally two days ago and it's plenty fast. TouchWiz doesn't bother me at all. I really don't understand why so many people on the internet cling so hard to the "Stock Android Purity Law" as if being designed by Google automatically makes it better. In fact, I tried the Moto X, M8, and S5 all side-by-side through multiple visits to the store and guess what? I actually liked the S5 the most. People have different tastes, and apparently lots of people like Samsung's design. 




 Likewise, McCain got a lot of flak for running back to Washington during the crash in 2008. 




 A great effect is that it increases the mobility of the labor force. Don't like your job? Quit and find a better one. It will improve the quality of businesses and improve labor relations too. 




 Minimum income guarantee is a great idea, but having it be flat across the entire country is a terrible idea. Canada is a really diverse place, and $20k would be vastly different in terms of actual purchasing power.

The immediate benefit of a guaranteed income would be that the Canadian government would be effectively subsidizing *all* businesses through increased spending and (possible) decrease/elimination of the minimum wage. You would have an increase in the mobility of the labor force as people would not be afraid to change jobs. 

However, it's not an insignificant cost: The only way to make up that shortfall would be through increased taxes -- for example, the government could increase tax revenue by increasing sales taxes or business income tax. At the end of the day, though, governments aren't there to make money but to make investments in their citizens. The real question is what kind of expenditure is appropriate for the government in this kind of scenario? 




 He was the only guy that showed up to the game. Belgium dominated the entire match. 




 WTF? The Red line goes across the entire city, as well as busses being practically everywhere. Boston hits way above its weight in terms of public transportation accessibility. Going downtown is effortless, and now night owl service is starting again. I lived there for six years for graduate school (2006-2012) and I could count on one hand the number of people who owned a car. 




 Lived in Boston for six years and recently moved away. Fall is most definitely the best season. Winters (and snowstorms!) are getting a lot shorter too so there are more weeks for keeping that peacoat out! 




 Surprised this is so far down. Back in graduate school I knew a diabetic guy who had some knowledge about these types of medical devices. He said that the reason why so many of them look so primitive is because it costs so much money to get them approved and the bar is set extremely high. An iPhone app controlling an insulin/glucagon pump sounds great, but there are a million of things that can go wrong. Granted, the atmosphere regarding FDA medical device approvals is steadily changing (eg. the inhalable insulin that just got approved), but we're still a long ways off from basic medical devices reaching the 21st century. 




 Also, by nature the judicial system is *supposed* to be conservative by design. It is not there to make new laws, but rather to clarify on whether a law has been broken or whether a new law is unconstitutional.

There are other avenues for citizens to make change. They're through the legislative and executive branch by way of elections. The state and federal governments in most cases can supercede the Supreme Court through constitutional amendments. But expecting the judicial system to create new laws is not exactly an efficient method for progressivism. 




 Ticket to Ride is one of the best games that I've ever played. Excellent replay value and great for newbies.

Pandemic is very difficult but it's edge-of-your-seat exciting. The problem is that it's a co-op game so it really depends on the group dynamic (eg. one guy could dominate the entire group with his opinion). Also very tough for newbies to figure out.

Love letters is an unexpectedly fun game. A friend showed the game to me once and I was pretty skeptical. Each round is like 30 seconds long, and is extremely addictive. 




 When I realized the research interns in my lab were born after 1990. In a few years many of them will be born after 2000. 




 I went to Harvard as a PhD student and this was always confusing to me. I knew a few people that ended up getting Masters degrees from the Extension school, and also plenty of people that ended up getting certificates or taking post-bac pre-med classes. As far as I know, for the degree programs you were still enrolled under the Extension School (which is part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences), so it's unclear whether you would be sharing classes with the rest of the undergrad community. You could join all the extracurriculars and community events, though. Finally, you were also strictly prohibited from listing your degree as from "Harvard University" and had to list it as "Harvard Extension School", although I know literally nobody that actually followed this rule on their resume. 




 Actually, contrary to popular belief, most of Europe is not covered by extensive public transit. Sure, the moderately sized towns and cities have good access, but the entire European continent is literally covered in podunk and suburban towns where there is no night-time transit. Most people have to drive for work and pleasure. It's not a very long distance, but they do it anyway.  




 That's nothing -- my Gmail account has 35k+ unread! 




 Also, the original TMNT cartoons were stupid as fuck but were pretty entertaining. Anyone who thought otherwise probably has their nostalgia turned up to 11. Just fire it up on Youtube. 




 But seriously though, most of the leaks that came out were attacking Google/MS/Yahoo, and the telecoms. Barely anything with Cisco or the companies that make the hardware itself. Kind of curious if you ask me... 




 If you're white, then the only time you'll ever witness things like this happen is when they're within eye or earshot. Which means you have to be in the right place at the right time.

For minorities, women, and the disadvantaged, even one event in their lives is too many. It's stupidly naive for people in this thread to think that this kind of thing doesn't happen. 




 If there were no profit incentive, then no drug company would ever invest in the R D necessary to create vaccines. Also, the regulatory framework around vaccines is one of the most rigorous and is independently reviewed across international agencies.

Here's another thing to think about: the fundamental issue is that there is a fundamental disconnect between any given person's *perceived risk* of getting vaccinated versus their perceived risk of contracting the disease that it protects against from the general public. One is an emotional non-quantitative assessment, whereas the latter has been backed by decades of longitudinal data. Then there is also the perceived risk of trusting a pharmaceutical company with a vaccine versus the actual number of scandals that actually involved vaccines. It doesn't come down to a perception of whether a pharmaceutical company is interested in my general welfare -- it's whether I believe that the risk to my well-being is higher when I trust them to make a vaccine versus the risk to my well-being if I chose not to. The problem is that the people who choose the latter consequently compound this risk not only for themselves but also for the general public. 




 Except for, you know, the fact that many childrens' vaccines are generics, the fact that you take them only once in your life severely dampens their profits, the fact that they have dramatically improved infant mortality in developing countries (where you would also expect the rate of increase of side effects would be *faster* if these vaccines were harmful)... 

You can make up all kinds of conspiracy theories about big pharma, but vaccines (and antibiotics) are one of those things where they have the *least* incentive to mess around. 




 Also it wouldn't make any sense if bacteria/archea and fungi were considered non-vegan, because such a pan-organismic view would mean plants wouldn't be vegan either. Unless you were a level 5 vegan. 




 I'd give them a bit more credit. The Transformers movies have been getting better with each sequel. I think the writers and even Bay himself have been getting comfortable with making this type of movie. There are very few decent movies that exist today where the main characters are *not* the humans. Godzilla was terrible (despite a lot of redditors loving it, for some reason), and Pacific Rim just barely got the right balance. The Hollywood track record actually isn't very good. 




 How do you not die of carbon monoxide poisoning in a tent? 




 The Wikileaks cables also showed that many Middle East countries were practically begging the US to invade Iran. 




 A lot of drugs come from nature, but they become FDA approved. The big thing I have against dietary supplements is that you can literally say anything with the special footnote and the FDA can't do anything about it. 




 There are bars here in the Bay Area where it's okay to throw your peanut shells on the floor. I almost had a brain aneurysm when I first saw it with my own eyes. 




 Seriously, that is some high budget stuff right there. 




 I think people miss this point because of short memory. ISIS is a symptom of tribal warfare in Iraq, but ultimately grew into an actual force during the Syrian conflict. It's really a sign of bad foreign policy by all parties involved that they didn't get that situation under control. The West chose to help out Libya because it was easy, but they should have kept their eyes on the prize in Syria. The longer a civil war, especially one involving religious sects, keeps on going in a country the more likely they will gain strength/resources and spill over into neighbors. 




 I don't get it either -- the US is basically allied with Saudi Arabia for purely historical reasons. If anything, in terms of geopolitical interests the US should be allied with Iran. Both Sunni and Shia want to destroy Israel so it all comes out in the wash, but there's a huge difference between funding AQ/ISIS and Hezbollah. Iran has a huge interest in stabilizing the Iraqi and Syrian region. Both countries are theocracies with questionable human rights records, but only one of them seem to be actively trying to destabilize Afghanistan and Iraq.
