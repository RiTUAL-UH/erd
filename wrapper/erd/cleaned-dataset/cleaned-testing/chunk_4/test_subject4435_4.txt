 Can I just have your number in general? 




 There's a new one happening right now but it just... doesn't sound right. The tone is off I guess. I can't explain it. 




 Goodness. 




 Wooooowwwww. 




 Hang in there. I'm sure someone will find you. 




 Format please. Text block is really hard to read. I had a hard time with it with my own post but if you hit enter twice at the end of a paragraph you'll get the space you need.
Edit: Made it through. Put a salt circle around your bed and your son's rock and play. Update us asap please. :) 




 I had to read that a couple times to figure out what really happened. Holy shit. 




 Dude. Did you kill your wife or something...? Or are you just a big bully? 




 What's a shadowban? 




 I will take you at your word OP. What is your motivation for killing? You don't sound at all deranged or like you are having psychiatric problems. 




 Yeah we already established Clayton is immune. This doesn't have the normal tone of the mold stories to it. I wonder... Also if you kill/let someone else kill Clayton, you're screwed. And who is Rachel? 




 Which one?! I'm in Nova Scotia and it's awfully nice to see a fellow Canuck on here. 




 This advice is probably gonna get me all kinds of flack BUT when my insomnia got to the point I couldn't function and I was seeing stuff, I started smoking a joint before bed every night, taking a sleeping pill with a cup of tea, and listening to really quiet classical music til I fell asleep. I eventually weaned myself off the routine but I still struggle with getting to sleep. I hope you can beat this OP. 




 That would be terrifying. I'm really glad you made it home safe and sound.  




 I had no idea where this was going. Nice writing style OP.  




 I would have done worse than kick him. I get angry in traffic when people are acting stupid and I have my dog in the car.... I'm really glad both you and Belle are okay. Dogs may not be "worth more" than people but I can promise you I'd save my dog before I'd save a person. 




 Anyone crack the code? 




 This is fantastic. Can you tell us more about Iggy, like what you've been up ti with him since, and if Roy is doing well? Dean Koontz often writes abut dogs and I must say the humor and descriptions here really reminded me of him. 




 I've seen this posted and read this like 3 times now.  




 Mold mold mold. You can't fix it. Get your sister and your dog and RUN. 




 Any news OP? 




 My dad was a trucker. He did long-haul all through my childhood. I have the utmost respect for what you do. Please be damned careful in this town. 




 I got so excited I teared up.  




 OH MY GOD IT'S THE MOLD I COULD CRY!!!!!!!! 




 I don't think I've ever smoked up at 4:20pm or am. It was always at like lunch time during school, or 11 or 12 at night right before bed. 

OP, I've heard that if someone you know calls your name, you should wait until they do it a second time, because the first is the devil or something trying to get your attention.  As for the doorbell, I've had it happen a few times. Always when I'm distracted, and there's other noise happening. Never had an explanation for it though. 




 Was that a typo in the story? We're compiling a list of the mistakes to see if they mean anything. 




 Nothing creepy ever happens in Nova Scotia. All the creepy stuff is elsewhere. :( 




 I haven't figured out if they're important yet. Can you let me know what the typos you've found are? We're trying to make a list to see if it means anything. 




 I may have but don't remember. Is there something I should know/read for reference? 




 Porkchop I need to know more!!!!! 




 IT MIGHT BE THE MOLD DON'T ASK QUESTIONS JUST IN CASE HE GOES AWAY! 




 You can also spell anal. 




 Amazing work! Thank you so much for doing all of this.  




 In Death Agreement - Severity, it says "widow" instead of "window" and in Mr Poe of Newark, "crank" is suddenly spelled "crack." (That last one is an easy typo to make though and may not necessarily be one.) 




 You're welcome. I hope everything is alright after last night. Keep us updated and stay safe. 




 Yes! There seems to be one word or letter in each one! If you figure out what it says, can you reply here? I'm curious if it's just my own mind messing with me. 




 It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?

 Motel sounds like a great plan, especially if the lights are out at home. You should be able to get bundled sage at any local occult shop but I'm not sure where else. You could try googling or searching Facebook for a local group that could help you. Wiccan groups, paranormal investigators, etc.  




 Have you found any pattern in the typos in each post? The stories are so well written something about the typos and mistaken words makes me feel like they're deliberate. 




 Salt circle around your bed, anywhere there's cracks, in doorways and windows, burn sage and waft the smoke all around your house. Start wearing a piece of sterling silver on your person. Update soon please. 




 Someone more patient than me needs to go through all these stories and see if the odd out of place words and typos are a message. They're too well written, the screw ups seem deliberate. 




 Has anyone else noticed the random typos? After reading the mold stories I'm like trained to see mistakes as hidden messages. This one says "of" instead of what I assume would be "some," and another one had an "are" in a place it didn't belong. 




 More please! I wanna know! 




 Awesome story OP. Your writing style is really engaging and easy to read. I've often heard that staring at your reflection too long will cause you to see things you don't want to see.  




 There's more? 




 I'm sorry OP. That happened to me a long time ago. PM me if you ever need to talk. 




 Hey OP any news? You doing alright?
