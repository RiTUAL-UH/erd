Get a job too, you're old enough to stop mooching off mom and dad. 




 Why do you get $30? For doing what? And you have your own car too? wtf?

When I was 15 I was legal to get a part-time job; I've never been unemployed longer than a month or two (thankfully) since. Before that I worked my ass off shoveling snow and mowing lawns in the neighbourhood to buy a pack of skittles or something small.

Wtf, $30 for doing zilch. I don't understand it 




 $296 a summer on games. Not bad.

 They are generally more relatable, as a group of misfits who all are living through Kirkwall's conflicts together. DAO's companions all kind of hated each other and DAI's companions just kind of latch onto the Inquisitor for their own personal gain (other than the original companions, e.g. Cassy and Cullen). 




 Nah, San Francisco/Silicon Valley is far more cyberpunk than NYC or Chicago in America.

 How do you so easily fall for obvious 4chan sarcasm? 




 He will play each for 10 minutes, get bored, then never touch them for the rest of his life. 




 Same with EA and their Dragon Age performance...I got 50FPS in Dragon Age 2 with my 970............. 




 I played Inquisition for about an hour with only the Keep video to help and I didnt know what was what or why mages were fighting templars, what the chantry was, etc. I then played through DAO and DA2, skipping most pointless side quests and just did the main stories and DLC. Playing Inquisition is drastically more enjoyable as all your actions carry more weight and you can see the cause and effect from past choicss that you made (rather than some website flash game). 




 Granted it wouldnt have the same impact. I did the Keep before DAO and DA2 and had no idea what was happening. There id no explanation about the mages plight in Thedas, who the Templars are, what Ferelden is, etc 




 I spent last night in a ditch 




 I think it's better than Origins. I just finished playing DAO and DA2 for the first time ever this past month to prepare myself for DAI which I started on Saturday. 




 Absolutely. Incredible game - make sure you play Dragon Age Origins and 2, or else the story and lore won't make much sense. 




 Why make a big post on Reddit? Why wouldn't one's immediate reaction to call EA Origin customer service? 




 I wouldn't call an unfinished alpha an "incredible game." Let's wait for release. 




 What drama happened exactly? He announced he was leaving a year ago 




 People who buy these alpha/beta packages are never considered investors - an investor expects a return on their investment.

 Your mom does not count. 




 You don't interact with real women much, do you? 




 I have never played through any Dragon Age and just finished Origins this past Friday :) Now about 40% through DA2. While I don't like the environments as much, the combat is way better (especially since I played mage in both).

Can't wait for Inquisition !! 




 Considering the state of modern AAA gaming - unoptimized ports that do not take advantage of all 4 cores, let alone 8 - I doubt the 8 cores will be of any advantage for quite some time unless you're doing video editing or something CPU-intensive. 




 Your CPU will rarely get to anywhere near 100% load on most games. If you want to burn your CPU, use Prime95.

As for games, it's the usual; check drivers first, uninstall old drivers, play around in-game settings and try other higher-end games (as CSGO and Smite look like last-gen games). 




 Just saying with his budget...if I were him I'd save up and get a 970 next year when the new 1080 or whatever the heck comes out. 




 Operating system?  




 When my 970 FTW really works hard I do get a bit of coil whine but its unnoticeable when game audio gets loud (or wearing headphones).

Performance wise, I get 50-60FPS maxed at 1440p in the most demanding games. Crysis 3 at max, MSAAx2, gives me about 45FPS and that is easily the most demanding game on market. The only game that is killing me is Dragon Age Inquisition @ 35-50FPS on *high* (not max). Can you say *unoptimized console port?*

If I knew about the coil whine before, I would have bought another card and down the "FTW" overclock myself. 




 You know you need to rebuy Windows for a new PC, right? 




 Get a GTX 660 - they're slightly better than a 750ti and will cost about $190 + tax. 




 I have changed it manually in-game. When I overclock to 120 or even 96, the frame skipping tests showed positive. I think my monitor just can't overclock. 




 He can build it himself and use the extra $300 to upgrade the GPU to a 970, get a CPU cooler and have change to spare

Edit: forgot to add ~$80 for the case.

Below is the same build on that website.

 How long ago did you apply thermal paste? 




 Wow very solid build man. Ask for a 1440p monitor for Christmas, $300 from Korea (ebay) :) Do you have a disc drive to install Windows?

 Do i need a cpu cooler (other than stock)?

Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.
 Do i need thermal paste?

Yes. They're dirt cheap and necessary

 minus an anti-static wrist band, anything else i need to fully build a pc?

Get an old credit card for the thermal paste. If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!). 




 Others reported getting their QNIX to 120Hz just fine. I tried OCing to 144Hz for fun and got crazy graphical glitches so clearly Nvidia is doing it's job. Maybe I just cannot see the difference. 




 Various benchmarks (heaven, valley), this website: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates

Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).

Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me. 




 I overclocked my QNIX to 120Hz and don't notice any difference from 60FPS :( 




 I thought you can buy any EA game and play it for 24 hours then return it? Or is that only for PC? 




 You get the same kind of goodies with other pre-orders; how is this any different? 

 Even if there's problems at release, they will be promptly fixed and all new content for the game will be free.

But how do you *know* this? Every developer has claimed the same, yet time and time again this is not always the case. 

Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y

What is with this attachment people having to developers? You don't know them. You don't work with them or for them. You pay them money for a product when it *releases.* Pre-ordering is so incredibly fucking pointless for digital products, it boggles the mind why someone except the most rabid of fanboy would go through with it.

I don't fucking care if Witcher 1 and 2 were great (they were). You don't work for CDProjekt Red. They could have entirely new management for all we know and completely fuck up Witcher 3. You don't know. All you have is this blind, unfounded faith in a group of Polish game developers. It makes no fucking sense. 




 I tried overclocking mine and Nvidia and Windows BOTH said it was at 120Hz at some point...yet I saw no difference with mouse, window and in-game movement. Maybe my eyes "can't see past 60fps?"

The online monitor test said it was at 120hz too, yet the 120 and 60fps UFOs didn't show any difference.

http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates 




 Why are you pre-ordering? What fucking purpose does that serve? Have you learned nothing from other games?

I don't care if GabeN himself came into your room with Half-Life 3 and offered it as a pre-order - don't fucking pre-order games. There's no point anymore. 




 Get a 1440p monitor for now - you will notice a substantial difference from 1080p, a single high-end GPU can run the vast majority of games at 60FPS on max settings and they're fairly inexpensive (I got my QNIX 1440p monitor within 2 days from Korea for $300). 




 750ti is shit for the price they're probably offering. 




 I am running a GTX 970 @ 1440p, with an i5-3570k @ 4.5GHz. I should not be getting FPS stutters in a game like Dragon Age 2.

What gives? This game is optimized horribly. It goes anywhere from 45 to a constant 60 (which is where it should be all the time). 




 Staples employee here. Same deal - diagnostic for $50, then whatever we need to do is extra. Usually around $150 for a whole setup dealy 




 For the 200 price range, 660 is good, 760 is best. I do have an old GTX 670 since I upgraded recently, but I can't explicitly sell things on this subreddit (that's what /r/hardwareswap is for).

http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html 




 $160 if you're Canadian, more cause international shipping (gimme your postal code and i can do the calculation). 




 Don't need the watch - I like my traditional analog watches ;)

But I got a Gigabyte GTX 670 that's only 2 years old, still runs great. I upgraded to a GTX 970 last week, so looking to sell it. This is the model: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125423

It will work SLI with your Zotac, as they're both 2GB version. 




 Well it will be cheaper at least later if you want another card for Crossfire 




 Wow that CPU is way overpowered for your GPU. 

Get this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116942nm_mc=AFC-C8Junctioncm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-nacm_sp=AID=10446076PID=3938566SID=

With the $50 you save, upgrade your GPU to a 760 instead. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127744cm_re=gtx_760-_-14-127-744-_-Product

Otherwise it is a fine build. Sexy case 




 Dang they price corrected :( 




 Get this instead - substantial upgrade for $30 more: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080cm_re=290-_-14-202-080-_-Product

And 500W is fine if you're not using 2 cards. 




 See for yourself: http://ssds.findthebest.com/compare/574-632/Crucial-MX100-512GB-CT512MX100SSD1-vs-Samsung-850-Pro-1000GB-MZ-7KE1T0BW

TLDR: not really. 1TB one has better warranty, longer life span, and better random speeds (but that is very minor at this stage). 




 I am a game dev too, so I have 16GB in my desktop. I started with 8, and like I said, waited for RAM go on sale - which it often does. I'd suggest using the extra money to get the 290X now if you find a good price, then wait for RAM to get marked down in a few weeks for Boxing Day.

For Maya, Adobe CS, etc. 8GB is enough unless you're doing super heavy-duty stuff (like an extremely hi-res model of a Star Citizen-esque spaceship).

Unless if you need the RAM now, the 290 is still a great card.

Do you have peripherals already? 




 1TB is 62cents a GB. 512 is 40c a GB. The 512 is more economical - also if one drive fails you're not completely screwed. 




 Hard drive? SSD? Will need somewhere to store Windows + games.

And unless you really need 16GB ram (which is usually overkill), get 8GB for $50 less and use that money towards and 290X instead.

If you need 16GB, wait for Boxing Day when that kind of stuff (RAM, hard drives, small stuff) goes down 50% off. 




 FYI for those getting a 970, the FTW is only another $20-30 and has a significant overclock 




 980 if you have the money. Or 970 now and SLI later. Don't need a steam box; just get HDMI cable to tv, run Steam Big Pictute with controller. 




 Get a 1440p monitor and we got the same PC (minus the 2 SSDs) 




 Probably next summerish, I'd say a year's anniversary and we'll start seeing announcements about a transition 




 Hey Bart want to go play with the x-ray machine in that abandoned hospital? 




 At least Molyneux makes decently fun, albeit shallow games. Dean just made a shitty mod for a shitty engine then charged suckers like myself $30 to play. 




 Thats bullshit. Ive worked with NZ, AU and Canadian expats in the telecomm field and all he needs is a work visa. 




 He's an ideas man who abandons projects before completion
 If he can show me a finished game I'll regain consumer confidence in him, otherwise he can fuck off with his new studio. 




 Well I'll just keep these then 




 Did you overclock anything? What drivers? Can you take a screenshot of your settings and/or in-game FPS? I'm dying to get above 40FPS at 1440p 




 Far Cry 4 runs at 45-50FPS on ultra for me at that resolution and GPU

Dragon Age Inquisition even worse at 35-40FPS. How does Crysis 3 run better than DAI on my 970? 




 The new Runescape has a scary resemblance to Albion. 




 eve? darkfall? tibia? and you say AA is not close? dafuq? How has no one mentioned Runescape, the almost direct predecessor to Albion Online? Fuck, they're even similar in art and interface style.

 Awesome OP. I have, unfortunately, had the opposite experience on Balmung. Cliquey roleplayers, elitists and other snobs who completely ignore me if I try to roleplay or ask a simple question. 




 I did the tapestry thing on EA's website and had no idea what was going on LOL, so it may be a good idea 




 I own all three Dragon Ages, but never played 2 nor progressed far in Origins. Should I play them before Inquisition, or is the story not really related?

I loved how Mass Effect kept the same character through all three; does Inquisition do the same? 




 Aftermarket coolers can extend the life span of your CPU, overclocked or base clock. 




 Sold my account back in June when I saw them first changing labour points. 




 The game has good lighting...and that's about it graphic wise.

 If you get the buyer protection for $1 you get a guaranteed key or your money back 




 "oooh, ice creamville" 









 What's wrong with QNIX? I got one last week and it's awesome. Overclocked to 120Hz easily. Korean all the way from now on; so cheap and just as good. 




 Would an 8800 Ultra work? I got one of those too lying around. 




 I have a 2GB 670 for sale or trade (looking for the new dragon age or razer naga)
