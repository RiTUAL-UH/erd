 I've never took the time to sit down and watch this in its entirety. I'll definitely do that next chance I have, thanks. What's the best version? 









 Link? 




 Very nice, thanks. I'll check it out. 




 Link? 




 Trying to dig out a few gems that I may not know exist.

 Haha no shit hey? I was on an auction 2 or 3 weeks ago and I maxed out at 220, I couldn't bring myself to go anymore. 




 [This was his reaction](http://i.imgur.com/05PowmR.png) 









 Ok thank you very much. 




 bah 




 I'll have a look around I guess. Thanks. 




 Oh sweet Jesus. Willing to sell it? 




 Since there seems to be an almost zero chance of finding the original pressing of Aenima on vinyl, would any of you lucky owners be willing to rip and share yours? I've heard so many good things about the recording, and it being my favorite album of all time, I'm dying to hear it. Not sure if it would be near the same quality, but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

EDIT: I should go on *record* here and say that I am not a fan of "pirating" music, and that I buy all the music I enjoy listening to, that this plea is nothing but a desperate man trying to fulfill his curiosity. I'd love nothing more than to take a trip back to 1996 this weekend and buy my own copy for a price that wouldn't take food from my children's mouths. 




 Might I recommend the novels "The Exorcost", and "Legion". 




 No worries. 




 That was my point. If I found the fog creepy, I would have to be agoraphobic(homichlophobic?). 




 Where I'm from, the fog is so thick you can lean on it. 














 I have no idea, sorry about that. 




 Hey, it was worth a shot. I'm glad you enjoyed them at least. If I can think of anything else I'll let you know. Take care. 




 Hotdogs, maggots, whiskey. Blend, serve out of a bowl. 




 Awesome, glad to hear that. Let me know what you think. 




 I listen to all sorts of music, mostly metal. Of course I don't like to play dreary stuff around my son who is just hitting the 20 month mark here, so my other acquired tastes have come in handy. Not that they have a positive message per se, but it's all about being instrumental, upbeat, and light (electronica is good for this). The little guy loves to dance and bob his head around. Anyways, try a few of these maybe.

 From my basic understanding, they prevent the natural downward airflow from leaving the tips of the wings, essentially causing the aircraft to weigh less in flight. Again, this is my very basic knowledge, actually might be a good question for /r/ELI5. 




 Memory express. There are several in the city. 




 Please see above coversation.  




 There's always maintenance. 




 I did an Aircraft Structural Repair course through a Transport Canada approved school, I then applied all across the country to find a position. Once my foot was in the door I gained more and more experience until I completed the required task list in a logbook, then I wrote an exam to acquire my AME 'S' license. Everything I do involves reading and understanding engineering approved repairs and OEM drawings. Engineers do not over see the project at hand, but are there as support if there is a deviation from drawing spec. As a licensed tech I would never put my name to anything that wasn't to drawing spec, or deviated without engineering approval.  




 Yeah, I know. I guess for those who never booked a flight online maybe? That sentence looks as ridiculous as it felt writing it. 




 NOT having them would be cost, HAVING them would be fuel efficiency. All depends on the customers requirements, much as if you were buying a new car, is paying a little extra for a hybrid something that's important to you. I guess with the winglets they double as good means of advertisement. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/7Xp7PVG.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Xp7PVG.png) 




 All hi-loks and bolts. 




 Without getting into too much detail, we would remove and replace the upper and lower outboard wing panels, beef up the outboard wing ribs, and add reinforcements to the wing stringers both in the wings and the centre tanks. Of course last but not least, hang the winglets.

EDIT: Eventually the 737's came from the factory with all the added rework complete, so that if a customer wanted to hang winglets, all they had to do was purchase and hang them up.

EDIT: Stringers not stingers. 




 No worries. It took so long because of all the structural reinforcement we did. 




 It's been a few years but if I remember correctly I think we had it down to something like 6 crews of 4 working around the clock for 4 days. That's not including the day of preparation by the mechanics.

EDIT: I just wanted to point out that my "glad to see they're still holding up" statement was meant to be light hearted, and of course it would be unsettling if they began to fail. However I absolutely wouldn't second guess anything we ever did, it was always done right. Westjet are all I ever fly. 




 That was a really fun job actually. Had a great crew to work with.

 Yeah I'm a fan of my tattoo artists work. [Here's another one he did for me](http://i.imgur.com/sL1ak.jpg). 




 Thank you very much. 




 One of the many awesome lines in that song. 




 I've already submitted this image to this sub before but [here it is again](http://i.imgur.com/tXvZxkL.jpg).

I've since added on to it and plan on turning my entire upper arm into a half sleeve. It's apparent what my favorite album is, Come On Up to the he House is probably my all time favourite track by Tom. 




 Yeah, what do you have to lose? I subscribed to /r/bandporn a while ago and I rarely see activity here. I am disappointed.  




 That's why I said "particular". 




 You might have better luck with this particular post in /r/horsemask 




 [http://i.imgur.com/7Xp7PVG.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Xp7PVG.png) 




 What a poor soul. 




 Haha wtf? 









 Hey thanks. 




 I've read the manual, and I do what it says, 16KM a month. That's the bare minimum it gets engaged during the summer months, it gets used much more during the winter. Haven't tried tapping anything with a hammer because it was under warranty therefore diagnosed and fixed with no cost to me. Thanks for your help though. 




 I know hey? What an awesome guy. 




 [The request](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zz8km/we_are_the_voices_of_tina_belcher_and_linda/cfybx9u) 









 I'm going to try introducing his sister to him, and then do what was suggested and bring him out for an ice cream. Then again, our little muffin might be asleep when he gets here so I'll keep this in mind. Thanks! 




 Thanks for this. I will keep this in mind. I have the next two weeks off so I will be sure to spend some extra father son time. 




 Awesome idea, I will do this. 




 Yeah he's not quite there yet. 




 Thank you! This was our initial idea, I think we will just go with it.  




 My wife brought our beautiful little baby girl into the world last night. We are very happy and proud. We also have a 19 month old son who has been staying with my wife's sister since she went into labour. We are home now and everyone is happy and healthy, however our son is still at aunties and is going to return tomorrow morning. My wife and I are nervous and curious about how we are supposed to introduce our son to our new edition. Should I hold her, or should mommy? I know it won't be the smoothest transition ever, but whatever we can do to make it easier on everyone will help. Thanks in advance reddit! 




 No shit hey? Such baloney. 




 So I've heard. 




 This is one persons point of view based on nothing more than conjecture. I don't think all three bands are some kind of twisted inside joke on the fans. More like people doing what they do best and making a living. Could the situation get anymore dissected? Talk about "over thinking and over analyzing". 




 Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names. 




 Absolutely. 




 Thank you very much for that. It's good to know this issue isn't directly attributed to me haha. I guess I'll cross that bridge if it happens again, I'm sure there are instructions online for this kind of thing. Thanks again. 




 As of this past weekend I have found out that my 4x4 actuator has failed, and my truck would not disengage from H4. I did some quick googling and found that this may be a common problem on newer Toyota models, however I wanted to know if any of you had experience with this issue. My truck is still covered by warranty so for now I will be spared the financial and labor burdens. However, if this is common I would like to know more about what it does exactly, and how I could prevent it from happening again (if possible) and/or fix it myself. 

Thanks in advance for your time. 

*FYI: I am not a mechanic, but I am mechanically inclined and wish to learn more about my vehicle as I am required.* 




 Feel free to shoot me any questions, hope it all works out. 




 I have personally been "diagnosed" with this personality type, it has helped to explain a lot. From what you described it sounds we've experienced some of the same things. Hope it helps.

 * Don't ever pick up smoking.

* Read, as much as you can. 




 Haha, that's awesome. 




 /r/rage 









 Ah, I see. 




 Oh man, you should totally share those screen shots if you get a chance. 




 Yeah I dropped off the Internet for a few years while getting my shit together, I missed it. Still refuse to get a Facebook account as well. 




 Crazy, I had no idea it went that long. 




 The blue was a good call, looks good dude. 




 Who are the other two dudes in this pic besides Patrick and Reznor? 




 My friend told me it was going to be Steve Austin and Steve Irwin. I said that couldn't be possible, but then again they brought Tupac back for lollapalooza. 




 Oh shit, what happened? No re-entry? 




 A stinkfist quote in this thread couldn't be more appropriate. 




 Yeah, I guess it depends on the venue. Have fun. 




 Bring a tube just in case. 




 He can use my kitchen when he's done with yours, for a piece of the pie that is. 




 Awesome, thanks again Sir. 




 So I found this:

[http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tool-Aenima-vinyl-record-2-discs-BMG-Zoo-1996-/131142218994](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tool-Aenima-vinyl-record-2-discs-BMG-Zoo-1996-/131142218994)

The guy writes:

*"UPC code is 6 1422-31087-1 1 There's another number on the back: 72445-11087-1"*

Does that make sense? Because it doesn't seem to. It would appear to be two different pressings. 




 Thank you. 




 How does one ensure they aren't getting hosed when attempting to buy a legitimate copy of this? 




 I have a baby due the day after so I may not make it,  I'll get over it though. 




 Well, that about sums it up I guess. It's a total shit show, and I'm still blown away, but this is the world we live in. 




 I'm thinking out loud here and this statement should be taken with a grain of salt, but if this is the case then it's time for me to find new forms of inspiration. 




 Heck I'd take the fire lane. 




 Agree 100%. 




 Well I've been looking for an excuse to hit the road and visit the states, as a new dad I don't get much time to do things like that. With my wife on board for a guys road trip I figured seeing Soundgarden and NIN together would have been a fantastic opportunity.  




 Wow dude, first concert ever was NIN. Your jaw must have hit the floor. 




 Yeah, you're probably right. It makes sense now that you mention it. I was really looking forward to an epic road trip but oh well I guess, first world problems. Enjoy the show man, the Tension bluray will have to tide me over whenever it's released. 




 Yeah I get it, but I don't, if you can pick up what I'm laying down. I'm surprised Trent hasn't voiced an opinion about this yet. 




 I personally don't mind flipping $100.00 on a big production act, I know it isn't cheap to haul all of their gear around, not to mention the show itself is totally worth it, but this has been taken to a new level of expensive.

Again, I could probably land some $100.00 tickets during the public sale, but nothing short of the first 30 rows would make my 35 hours of driving worth it.

I'm with you on the underground, Animals As Leaders are playing downtown here for 25 dollars, can't get much better than that. 




 For those of you wanting to know:

* I took the picture with my phone because I wanted to quickly send it to my cousin and didn't want to go through the process on my phone.

* These are the "platinum" seats for Red Rocks using the "MYWAVE" Soundgarden fan club code.

* It is my personal opinion that no one is worth this much and that these are obviously reserved for the rich. (Unless of course there was some kind of meet and greet and/or sound check attendance which even then I wouldn't flip the bill)

* I can't see Trent agreeing to this after all he's stood up and said regarding corporations with hands in his pockets. What the actual fuck is going on here?

 









 I had the exact same issue, although captcha seemed to fuck me over as well. No matter how many times I plugged in the captcha correctly, it would not let me through. I was planning a huge road trip from Calgary for this show, fuck. 




 This is my favourite aircraft on the planet. Thanks for these, haven't seen them before. 




 Very nice. I have quite a few framed and matted myself. I've yet to post my collection. At least I don't think I have haha. 




 Are you still farming negs in /r/toolband? I gotta give it to you, that's pretty dedicated. 




 Damn, didn't even see that. 




 Newfoundland beaches look nothing like that. Then again, neither do the Newfoundlanders. I'm going to go with my gut on this one and say it's fake. 




 Go to Michael's, get a decent frame, and a color matching matte. That's your best and cheapest method for preserving its awesomeness. Otherwise, you could go full on custom, it'll cost quite a bit more but look pretty rad. This is assuming of course this wave of posters are again, not of standard size. I'm glad to hear there is no damage to it, way too nice for thumbtacks. 




 Dear God, is that thing tacked to the wall? 




 Turns out the F29345-3 anchor nut is a good alternative. Thanks for your help. 




 No dice, but this document will definitely come in handy in the future. Thanks for that. 




 My issue is I don't know the part number, and to the best of my knowledge I'm not sure if they even exist. Basically I'm looking for a corner (mickey mouse) style domed anchor nut, similar to the NAS1473A3. So I was hoping to find a comprehensive list breaking down all the different part numbers.  




 I've searched for a while now with no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm looking mostly for NAS anchor nut specs. 




 As a naive 13 year old at the time, you may be right. 




 Thank you. 




 Well [here is the ghost](http://www.chatphiles.com/) of said website. It looks exactly the same, just inoperable. 




 Haha it's all good. You wouldn't be talking about mIRC by any chance are you?

Chatphiles was dedicated to X-Files, you ranked up through an FBI like ranking system with frequent use. I can't remember the room names, but they were all X-Files related. It's been so long I'm trying to figure out what happened to the site. 




 Nice, thanks. 




 I'm a structures guy, so I'm hoping that same applies if need be. I have also been in the inspection department for 4ish years. 




 Yes sir, that's where that plane was headed. 




 Hey man I am just a simple inspector but I'm glad Viking was there to help out. 




 That would be the place! 




 Radiohead have nothing on Tool's perfectionism/procrastination. This is my attempt at humor and not to be taken seriously. I love both bands very much, but Tool hasn't released anything since 2006 and it's bit of a touchy subject over in /r/toolband, so much so I don't even comment about it.
