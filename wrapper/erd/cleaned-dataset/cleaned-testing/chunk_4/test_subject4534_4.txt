 I'm kind of the same as well. I don't really stress out over things. As a kid the plans my parents would make was always a 50/50 of whether or not they followed through so I've learned to just roll with things. I don't make plans. If something happens, then I just go with it. I'm always surprised at how emotional people can get and how stressed out they can be. I started thinking people would find my calmness very odd so now I try to "show" more of a emotional reaction when really I'm pretty calm. 




 Is it not common practice to clean your place before going on vacation? When I started living on my own I made it a habit of cleaning my entire place whenever I would be out of town. I really don't like the idea of coming home to dirty sheets, dishes in the sink, and garage in the garbage bin that's been sitting there for awhile. Even now that I have a roommate who will be home I always make sure to clean the entire place before I leave. 




 Frak. I wish I knew this yesterday when I got a spam text for some FIFA prize thingy and a link. I deleted the damn text but wish I could report it now. 




 One christmas my aunt gave my siblings and me a camera that printed small stickers. It was an awesome gift but then she told us she had given it to us by accident and it wasn't meant for us but we could have it. She intended to give us this crap gift. 




 I never completed Star Wars Episode 1 Racer. There is one track I couldn't get past. 




 A family friend told me that he went to a private party where the Dixie Chicks played for 1 million. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna save up now! 




 The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell. 




 I love this show. Glad to hear there's a movie coming. 




 I couldn't snap either so I decided to learn. I just practiced for a few days. Hurt because my fingers weren't used to doing it but now I can snap with my right fingers, left not so much. 




 I never understood the alligator thing so I just think that it points to the smaller number. If it starts small, it's less than. 




 Last year I took a year off of school and stayed with my parents. I was probably unemployed for like six months while I was there before I got a job. My parents travelled a lot so I took care of their two dogs, the house, and helped with both of brother's kids whenever they needed a babysitter or needed someone to drop off/pick up the kids from school. It sucked. I was bored out of my mind. I spent my days taking the dogs for walks, visiting my grandma who lived down the street, and cleaning the house. A lot of internet surfing and watching movies. 




 This works for me. I'm near sighted in my right eye but my vision isn't too blurry in that eye. It just makes things a little sharper. 




 My 6 year old nephew probably would. 




 My gamer friend introduced me to minecraft when it was in its early days. Now my 6 year old nephew plays it on his xbox and my 5 year old niece plays it on her ipad.  




 As someone from a small town who loves country music, the whole "I'm so country" is wearing thin. My hometown is traditionally hunter-gatherer so no farms, ranches or horses. It's just hunting and harvesting. The people who live that life don't talk about it and post it on facebook because it's just life to them. It's no big deal that they split logs, put down fish nets, and set up traps and travel hundreds of kilometers to catch bigger game while holding down jobs to take care of their family. They're not tailgating, having bonfires, drinking beer from a dixie cup, or posing with their guns for facebook. That boat they own has a purpose and so does that snowmobile, it's to get them to their nets or traps and to travel long distances over water or land for bigger game. And that truck they have is to transport the cords of wood they cut to either heat their homes or in the summer cook their food over a firepit. 




 Guitar stand. My brother and me would prop them against our stomachs and pretend to be x wing fighter pilots or something. Pew pew pew. Flying around the house until our dad demanded we put them back. 




 I'd be a slacker or a moocher because I wasn't thinking about what I wanted to be at 5. I was too busy being a dusty kid with scraped knees in a small town. 




 I haven't had cable tv in two years. I do have netflix and if I want to watch a new episode of a show I'll go to the networks website the day after it airs and watch it there. My roommate doesn't watch TV, just youtube vloggers. So no cable tv missed.
