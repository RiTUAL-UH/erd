 Dominique Wilkins. The guy had heart, and he dunked like he wanted to throw his whole body through the rim.  




 They're both in 'motor valley' about half an hour out of Bologna. Basically, if you're a petrolhead and you're in the region, it's a must-visit destination. Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Ferrari, Lamborghini etc etc... This is no big deal. 




 He does come off as a bit of a knob to the casual viewer.  




 There can be only one. 




 Len Bias? 




 Sure ain't going to be a team that places emphasis on character. The guy's a fool.  




 A black guy, clearly.  




 YOU CAN'T COMPARE HIM TO DIFFERENT COLORED PEOPLE DON'T YOU KNOW THE RULES 




 LEAFS YOU FOOL.

LEAFS. 




 "Whose game is it? It's Michael Jordan's game!" - still gives me chills. And what a game! 

6:55 for the insane layup, steal, turnover, block and the call but the whole game is dynamite. 

Bulls vs. Knicks: 1992 Playoffs, Game 7.  Jordan : http://youtu.be/D9BKx2HN8Ms 




 Jordan to team up with LeBron and Melo to form Detroit big 3.  




 This is about vanity, if you like having a clean shiny chain you go for it - but this guy's right. You're probably reducing its lifespan.  




 Well, that's a Dwight Howard Lakers top, so it's less than 2 years since it was filmed.  




 Cover it with a white spot.  




 Or the next Gerald Green, albeit without the cringeworthy tough guy sooky mugging after dunks.  




 At 12 mm on a full frame, you can almost see behind yourself. In the wedding shot I would have looked like I was right in their faces, no more than a couple feet away. It can be a really cool effect but it feels incredibly rude to shoot this way!

 Dude, the place is jumping! Plenty of people wouldn't have it any other way. You and I like a bit more space but others like the pace of a big city like that.  




 *dominant 




 Man, a Kurt Rambis basketball card was always the best shitty one to get in your pack. Those glasses... That moustache... I almost couldn't believe he was a real person.

http://d1warraxuf7xh1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/act_kurt_rambis.jpg 




 His sources were probably executives that were worried about the foot. He didn't report that the foot was fucked, he just said it was an issue with various executives. Both sides could be right on this one.  




 Yeah I kind of had it in my head that he was old, tired and flogged out. I guess not! 




 You'd have to include Oden then.  




 I've had the fuckers draw level with me at 80kmh.  




 Pessimistically confident.  




 It was probably all the #thereturn crap. Hold the guy up as basketball Jesus and there's bound to be a backlash. 




 Ahhhh shit, the poor bastard. His wave was just about to break. 




 Can't see that happening. Wade is part of the furniture.  




 Don't you have something better to do?  




 Motorcycle sales would rocket.  




 I dunno about that. Pop has said he's gonna retire the day Timmy does.  




 Small ball and the trap defense worked for a particular lineup of guys - Miami is rebuilding from scratch now, so I'd presume their style of play will change depending on who they sign. 




 Keep one of these under your seat: http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Safety-Car-Bike-Auto-Tubeless-Tire-Tyre-Puncture-Plug-Repair-Cement-Tool-Kit-/291047728863?_trksid=p2054897.l5660

You can also get miniature air compressors. I use them heaps - as often on my mates' bikes/cars as on my own. 




 Hornet 919 was one of the best all-round bikes I ever owned. I miss it heaps. It fit me like a glove and did everything - touring, stunting, track days, commuting, great for passengers, the lot. 

I haven't ridden the FZ09 yet - it's on the list - but you can pick those old Hornets up super cheap in my part of town and I'm forever looking at them in the paper and going "hmmmmm..."

The Speed Triple, if you can stretch for one of those, is the [best bike in the whole world ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDNrRX6EzWA). 




 I thought it was called a four-play.  




 Dude that was one of the all time greatest highlights I've ever seen. And it came right after another insane putback slam. I feel for Pau and all but those made me jump out of my seat.  




 Because if they're paid what they're worth, they'll lose again.  




 That was more or less me 15 years ago. Funny thing is, the muscle memory of all those thousands of hours hasn't gone away. I don't shoot hoops for years at a time but I can step right up and hit 8 for 10 free throws. 

Anyway, I feel for ya but there's a big wide world of other stuff out there. Motorcycles filled the gap for me.  




 Yeah they're tops! I'm just trying to arrange a test unit, the SMH10 and 10R turned me back on to riding with headsets. 




 On my high school team we had one guy who could dunk, and it was a big deal. 




 It was that or Drew Peacock. I just wanted a penis name.  




 He was an unstoppable offensive rebounder when MyPlayer Dick Harden got drafted to Dallas.  




 I dunno, surely it's a severe dose of short-man complex that makes him the ferocious competitor he is... 




 I kinda have a bad feeling about it. A kind of cancery feeling. The Bulls' success has been built on heart, effort and hard work. I'm not sure you can plug a me-first guy into that and not kill it.   




 At least she's not called La La. 




 Yup that's me. 1198 isn't the worst bike I've ridden around town - I've been riding the new Buell lately and that takes that dubious honor. But the s1000rr is as smooth as butter. If you want a bike that can be Clark Kent as well as superman, it's gotta be the Beemer. Doesn't look as nice but test ride both and the difference will be obvious.  




 Went up there with a car and a bike a few months ago. 3 nails in the bike rear tyre, one in the car tyre. What the hell is that all about?  




 The amount of seriously dicey u-turns I've done on windy roads durung tests... *shudder* 




 Fucken lot of work eh. I'm ashamed to say it but the farty noises in your oil change vid made me giggle like a school girl.  




 Lightning is about to release something that will shit on every bike on the road. Fastest production bike ever.  




 That team could be the most punchable collection of faces in history.  




 And bow legged. 




 The leftist party wasn't left enough for the southern States, plus they'd just made cunts of themselves. Abbott won by keeping his mouth shut. And he's probably still got loads of support, just not from people who can use the Internet.  




 Jordan has become a real heart and soul player in the last 2 years. I'd be very sad to see him go.  




 That's absolutely stunning footage for a 21 year old sports broadcast. Crystal clear... And so many cameras - they had just as many on the reverse side. Clearly knew they were filming a once in a lifetime athlete.  




 Certainly the best correction of athletes - not sure it really lived up to its potential though.  




 Bron needs his hand held and Wade needs to feel like he's still relevant?

Edit: I think it's more like Bron throwing Wade a bone. 




 PJ3 played some really good ball while Westbrook was out. Sad to see him ride the bench in the playoffs. 




 I've been lucky enough to ride a ton of bikes, and the best by a mile was the Speed Triple. No question.  




 DONGGGGGG 




 I had the chance to sit down with Randy Mamola once a few years ago and ask about this stuff. He told me that an engine part made for Rossi might cost 3 times as much as the one on Lorenzo's bike. There's a huge difference again between that and the satellite bikes.  




 Hard to beat Wade in hateability.  




 I want total humiliation.  




 They should let Bron do interviews without Wade there to hold his hand.  




 Condolences in your last two decades.  




 Bulls with Melo and Rose might be able to knock the heat off, especially if they bring the chump game we've seen the last two times out.  




 The Poo Game (tm)
 




 Plus, he takes an arse-kicking like a champ. 




 I think it's great. As often as not, it takes a special kind of psychopath to become rich enough to own an NBA team. Hang 'em high if they've been pricks. 




 No way - the Spurs first half offense has been blowing everyone away. Mind you, so has the Heat's shitty D. 




 That Heat uniform is the wrong colour to be shitting yourself in. 




 Then again, Melo might look at the way Bosh has gone from being the Man to playing third and fourth fiddle. 




 So much skill, such a finely tuned human being, erased in an instant after what was probably a tiny error. Vale Bob Price. 









 You and I could work as hard as we wanted and not end up with his size, strength or bounce. Even among NBA athletes, most of whom work like bastards, he's an outlier.

Edit: missed your point entirely, play on! 




 A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers. Much as I want Miami to lose, I don't think we'll see that kind of effort again. 




 Winning genetic lotteries? 




 All those chats are played through the in house PA. 




 I make a point of blurring the speedo in anything I put up anywhere. No need for John Q. Law to have any reason to come after you, no need for anyone who knows the road to be looking at what your corner speeds are - whether it's higher or lower than theirs, little good can come of it. 




 He's an ignoranus.  




 This can go back and forth all day. You've got your opinion, I've told you mine. Great player, bullshit situation and I don't have to be impressed by it.  




 Took his legacy in his hands by teaming up with two of his biggest competitors in the east and taking a pay cut to prevent the salary cap from maintaining competitive balance. Clearly it worked a treat, and plenty of people jump on board when you start winning.  




 I have plenty of respect for LeBron's game, but fuck the Miami superteam. It's a pussy's path to a ring.  




 If everybody you meet seems to be an arsehole, you're probably the arsehole.  




 Those dunks at the end... Lad's got some anger to get out.  




 Outlaw gangs are very real and very serious.  




 You know, it's kind of possible.  




 The leap to side-sitting on the tank at 2:15 made me laugh out loud in joy and disbelief. Beast! 




 So... What sound does a cockenballs make?  




 Garn then, show us!  




 Wow. I can't remember ever seeing somebody get thrown so high.  




 He's handling garbage most of the time.  




 "Cupcake?" 




 Me too! Excellent cheap hobby.  




 I've got some 5-driver Westone jobs. I use then for onstage in-ear monitors. Having said that, I think they're total overkill even for that. I reckon most any molded earpieces would do the job.  




 Lance Stephenson:

http://i.lvme.me/rri734x.jpg 




 Well he does seem like a bit of a cunt.  




 ...says the guy on the FJ... :P 




 Right with ya mate, not naked enough. 




 About the same as good noise cancellers.  




 I thought the sennheiser noise canceling cans were pretty good, until I started taking a set of molded earphones on the plane with me. They're tons better, you can listen to stuff on the lowest volume setting. Lets your brain relax.  




 Interesting point. I guess we'll see.  




 How much of that was flat top?  




 I don't think it's cool for you to broadcast that offer Glidecam extended you. 




 Agreed. It was so good, it made me like a Nickelback song.  




 Right - not to mention how deflating it is to your sense of self belief to take on the best team in the league without your #3 offensive option and best defender. OKC plays on emotion, this is a killer.

Also, fuck the heat. 




 Onya dad! :) 




 Won a stack of road races too, Angel Nieto rode Bultaco in the 70s. But more recently they've been known as off-road and trials 2-strokers. 




 ...but you've only got one arse to put on them! 




 Nothing about OKC's stagnant, iso-heavy offence convinced me they'd beat the spurs even when Ibaka was healthy. Ibaka is their most important defensive asset and their #3 option at the other end. They might get a win or two but I think they're finished, especially since the Spurs have a great defender to put on KD, and home court advantage to boot. 




 Top level racers are by no means normal people.  




 Regular season records don't count if your team is coasting like a bitch.  




 Agreed. Source: will never shut up about hating this chequebook superteam.  




 They were all pathetic. And he should die in a fire. 




 But it's basically totally comprised of wrinkles! 




 This is only true of some people's spit. But when you find someone with just the right loogies, you hang on with both hands.
