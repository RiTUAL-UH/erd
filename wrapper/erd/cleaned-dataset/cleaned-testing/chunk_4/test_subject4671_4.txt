 the thing is...you have the same amount of units at that mark as you normally would so it doesn't effect your ability to hold it. 




 as so0n as you scout it start getting towards vikings. Multiple bunkers(mostly just to delay the push), pull all the scv's when you finally do attack 




 What is the thought of 1 rax double expo against protoss? I tried the build today and it seemed like my midgame push was much stronger(but slightly delayed). It keeps you ahead of a fast expanding protoss on economy and you don't sacrifice much in terms of army production because the increase in scv's gets your back up to production levels of income quicker. Discuss. 




 GSTL has players planning in the same way Code S does...Same with Code A.  




 my point was that you were choosing your data to fit your point. You can't said oh Code S is decent win % and ignore Code A, Foreign tournis, and GSTL.  




 i'm talking about dropping around max. Of course you can try to drop before then but most decent zergs(plat or better) should be able to shut those down with minimum losses. The theory is that since brood lord army is so slow you should drop to exploit that...except that's putting at least 12 army supply away from your main force in what is already a hard straight up fight. sure maybe that one drop might kill some drones but it hardly matters if the rest of your army dies. 




 if you drop you die because those units aren't present in the big fight. 




 not including the (1-26) winrate in the GSTL

 I believe there is a blog post by blizzard that says if you get to x number of points in a season you gaurentee yourself a promotion. 




 i can't answer all your questions but i can answer a few.

* By placing a sacrifice depot you do nothing, any skilled player can pick that off with roaches or will ignore it.
* I dont understand how factories floating matters...but they will probably target the wall on one point and then ignore it while trying to kill off units.
*i place my down right before i head out for attack i think.
* a bunker and some depots..just like your natural. Don't use baracks bc then you have to interrupt production to lift.(also you really should make sure you get those 50 scv's!)
* I almost never win vs z with my initial push, rather it sets me up to kill them eventually/get into the late game ahead.
* It depends on what X is and what their composition is an whether you want to rush medivacs/tanks
* I do this! I have a +1/+1 stim medi timing that i hit against z...usually combat shields finishes up during the attack or slightly after i think. I'll link a replay here when i get home. You can really explore the 1 rax FE. Fast tanks/slow tanks/no tanks/1 rax to mech. Each is situational though...If you are comfortable with one,stick to it.
* 50 probes by 10 minutes(and 100 overall supply iirc)
* if someone is going mass muta just go kill them. Mutas suck in head to head...or build a thor or 2....turrets are really only there to delay them. 




 as a terran...you hit the E button and then click..then approximately 2 seconds later is when the emp actually hits. At least thats been my experience. 




 just so you know, emp is not instant...it takes a while to cast 




 thanks 




 i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises 




 i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises 




 the program isn't very outlined from what i've seen. Just giving the exercises to do but nothing outline progression(whereas SS is really specific with its progression) 




 I did my first day of Westside yesterday but I'm not sure how to progress on my upper body max day. Do i increase all my weights? 









 how did you determine your starting weights while doing west side? 




 okay, watching your replay i noticed you are basically doing a 1 base all in...is there any reason why? 

first note is you actually see his overlord scout in your vision but you still send your scv scout the wrong way. If that scv scout goes straight to his base you see the lack of drones and you can bunker up.

Here is what your base looks like when the baneling bust hits. Up to this point you've done no scouting. http://i.imgur.com/SoeYD.jpg

Here is what my base looks like(notice i've taken an expansion and still have almost the exact same supply amount as you) http://i.imgur.com/nYdyk.jpg

tl:dr-if you scout it they can't win 




 select is the game reported before and is from 2010..should be on the mlg site somewhere hopefully. 




 I remember when i was in silver/gold league i thought banelings were the most overpowered unit in the game and i seriously thought "herp derp make banelings". But then i learned to split my marines and how to target with tanks and now i trade with banelings well. Currently TvZ is my strongest matchup as i fell terran is really good at abusing zerg at all times in the game. My worst match up by far is TvT and that can't be based on OP/UP. 

I think Protoss is the easiest race most definitely and the strongest race and I think they could use a late game nerf. But if they get nerfed late game then they can't compete with Zerg. I've just come to accept that I have to play better than other races if I want to be better than them.

 So i'm thinking about starting Westside for Skinny Bastards and I'm looking at starting with the following schedule for day1

* bench press: max set of 3-5 reps.
* dumbbell bench press: 3 sets of 6-10 reps.
* Chest supported rows: 4 sets of 10-15 reps.
* rear delt machine: 3 sets of 12-15 reps.
* Hanging leg raises: 3 sets of 8-15 reps.

my questions is how do i determine a good weight for the non max exercises. I know i can do the SS method for the bench press(add 10 lbs until i slow down but what about the other ones. Same method?
 




 actually thats part of the beauty of this build, any 2 base all is extremely weakened bc of taking out sentries or even just the zealots. Scary counters are 1 base colossi and 2 base colossi is harder as it forces late game. 




 This is not an all in build...in fact its a really strong build that techs really well. I personally prefer the 4 rax variation of this but the idea is that you(as terran) want to trade minerals for gas. The early marine pressure is simply about sniping as many sentries/stalkers as possibl to delay tech or weaken it(as it wont have enough supporting units. Taking 4(or even 3) gas afterwards you can still tech appropriately without delaying tech.

EDIT: the build for the 4 rax variation is  10 depot,12rax,15 cc, 15 2nd depot, 18 2nd Command, 25-3(rax),supply depot so i would assume 6 is similar 




 thats the point...once i scout them i'm not sure how to react 




 but scv's don't really help against banelings :-/ 




 What is the best way to defend an all in assuming you've already 1 -raxed expanded. I've been hitting a lot of four gates/3 gate proxy robos/baneling busts/roach baneling bust and have correctly identified all of them coming. Some I hold, some i don't. However, I don't ever feel in control of the situation. I just kinda pray they mess up somehow or back off a little bit. How do you hold these builds?

I "know" the answer is bunkers but i'm not sure of the amount to make and also whether to prioritize them over say a supply depot so i don't get supply blocked. 




 all weekend the streams in the live player were freezing/stopping. I tried talking to support and they either told me i was lying or told me to switch browsers and would not help further. I was really pissed as a paying customer. When i went to twitch.tv I had no problems except not being able to watch high quality...but that was better than everything stopping middle game 




 its b een doing all weekend and when i contacted support they told me i was lying .
 




 He sounds totally different...a lot like he did back in the day 




 i go 4 rax into 3 gas..i think its puma's build. gets tech up at a decent rate and allows quick 3rd 




 If you play terran and are diamond level or below this timing attack should be pretty powerful. I can't speak for higher than diamond as i haven't matched up against any masters zergs yet. There is a couple of variations of the build in this replay but this is my standard one. Note that i had horrible macro but it didn't matter.

here is another replay where i dont commit to that push as much because i scout early units.

I'm also working on a 1 rax expand variation of this build that skips the helions that i'll post here soon

EDIT: the basic idea is map control is gained via aggression

 I recently posted my TvZ push that I've been doing to good success here and may post my TvP once i've gotten the late game transition ironed out. My basic build right now is 1 rax expand into 4 rax with a midgame pressures that build up advantages. 




 as a fellow platinum terran
TvT-i think thats just how the match up plays as I run into the same issue. I've been experimenting with bio and it seems to do well at times.
TvZ-you should be killing them before broodlords....or you should be so far a head that you can just produce vikings and marines and kill them.
TvP- Dont get to the late game...ever. 




 oh snap....now i can afford to off race! 




 would a nicer less gas heavy move be just to start into a ffe? cannons murder marines...don't really know as i'm terran though 




 here is my NA contact info: test_subject4671.465 friend me and i will do a couple of practice games with you so you can get a feel for where you might need static defense and/or marines 




 and they didn't even produce lag free to US. 'm in VA and was lagging  incredibly all thoughout last day 




 no...i posted a thread about this before the event and it got downvoted to hell...only half the games were commentated 




 sounds like a good variant of it. This is just a general guide line. other times i'll  go faster tanks or i'll create a reactor for the starport ^.^

 no. I should have taken a 3rd and 4th gas guyser with my 3rd command center instead of going for a 3rd and 4th cc.  delayed 2/2 purely macro level mistake as I have other games where i've timed it much better.

Edit: If you watch my POV you can see that i was almost solely focused on the attack and wasn't macroing well 




 1st game was a mech vs bio base race and 2nd game was build order win. so pretty decent 




 It was on POV 3. I believe score was 2-0. Goody mech so good!

General ideas of the push:
Reactor helion expand
add two more rax w/ reactors
add a gas, build a starport and 2 engineering bays
get 1/1 and push with first two medivacs w/ a scan available to clear creep
follow up with 3rd and tank production.


The hardest thing for me to hold off is a baneling/roach all in simply bc of lack of units so I really half to keep track of gas/units with my helions. If I scout it I'll prioritize tanks over medivacs and build a lot of bunkers. This is a powering build so once it takes off you should have a good advantage 




 I like to do a strong time push that hits before mutas
http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476 




 they did it for the previous arena by bringing in the playhem guys(robin, adebisi, axel, tumba) and i preferred that. 




 last arena they had 8 streams iirc-4 casted and the main screen POV. I would prefer that to the 10 stream, 2 casted and the rest POV as I prefer a casted viewing experience 




 its not a concern so much as a preference...and if enough people share my preference than MLG should take note...if not it doesn't matter...but as a consumer we should dictate the market.  




 So according to the press release by MLG, half the games will have no casters and will simply be POV of players in the game. Is anyone actually looking forward to those streams? Are you planning on watching those streams? I personally would rather see those four streams reduce to 2 commentated streams as I personally enjoy the extra casters 




 i've had two friends die from bench press failures and one become paralyzed...thanks but no thanks. 




 I would like to gain muscle...I really dont have a ton of fat to lose. 6 foot - 175 ish. I just finished p90x to get to that from 200lbs...but that program didn't seem appropriate to adding mass muscle. 




 I looked through the links/faq but I couldn't seem to find what I was looking for. I'm trying to find a good gym schedule that i could follow that would be less focused on big lifts(like squats, deadlifts, bench press). To be honest, I'm just not that comfortable in a gym, much less with that amount of weight without a spotter. Can anyone direct me to a good program. thank you :)

EDIT: Just finished p90x so i've done bodyweight exercises but am looking for something that allows for bulking easier 




 and my vuvuzela 




 its very hard to keep ravens alive in a fight 




 the belief is that you have to do early damage to even participate..I prefer a 1 rax gasless expand into 4 rax 3 gas build. If opponent 1 gate expand or nexus first i feel my 9 minute mark push and then 11 minute mark pushes will do so much damage that i win... 3 gate robo is the bane of my existence though lol. (plat terran beating diamond p's) 




 I've been doing to polt bio play with double ebay. It gets countered by mass ling infestor somewhat but if i scout that composition I'm perfectly comfortable doing non stop drops and playing for the late game. I feel the longer the game goes the better it is for terran as I can snipe bases/drones etc easier and bc terran is very cost effective 




 no i'm saying we shouldn't act shocked that they act like every other business 




 Seriously guys. Everyone is in an uproar over the KESPA/MLG thing. MLG is a business that is trying to make a profit. You know how they always say that if IPL/IEM/NASL go out of business its bad for ESPORTs? Thats a lie! only one of these can come out as the alpha dog(see ABA vs NBA, WCW vs WWE, UFC vs Strikeforce, etc) and MLG is positioning themselves to win. 




 i play terran and i dont have any of my builds mapped out above 40 supply(and thats only for protoss). I feel terran plays really reactively as well 




 isn't the other player thorzain since he won Dreamhack?
 




 thanks for the link...its weird..i can connect now . 




 In the USA, can't connect to battlenet. Any one else having the same issues? 




 core is my favorite workout...i may be a masochist though... 




 It all depends on wha t want to follow up with. I've been using the polt 3rax late tanks early double ups style(detailed in a recent day9 daily) so after my first 4 helions are on the map i'm throwing down two more rax(around the time i see roaches/banelings) i have enough time to produce 1-2 mauraders and bunkers etc. Remember that helions are primarily a scouting tool that help deny the third...keep them a live at all cost.

EDIT:i wait until i have all 3 rax up with 2 reactors and 1 tech lab before moving out or if i scout early double spine or quad queen at the front of opponents base(since that signals they are being passive) 




 i wall off with the factory/reactor bc that provides a high HP target that a zerg can waste banelings on. Plus it funnels towards one of the two depots. You shouldn't have your expand on the low ground until you have a force of 10 marines at the least(which will be well after both the roach and baneling time) but yes sac the depots. Remember these are respectively ALL INS..if he doesn't beat you there then you pretty much auto win. therefor we want to make it as hard to beat as possible. making him go up the ramp means you can line up the hellions to destroy most the banelings as they come up the ramp
EDIT: and if he has roaches keep producing those maruaders and set a couple scvs to auto repair and then lol as you win 




 as soon as you see the roaches pull back the hellions and build a marauder and a bunker at the top of your ramp..remember he is sacrificing his economy to damage NOW so you can delay your expansion easily. 




 High Plat terran here:

your first helions come out right around the time a baneling bust hits if you are doing helion expand. by this time you should have an scv that has scout his main/natural...if he has no natural bunkers(2) at the top should solve all problems(including roach rush etc). Keep the scv in his natural to make sure he doesn't take it(hide behind mineral line)

assuming you 1 rax expand in tvp(which you definitely should be doing) then you put one bunker down automatically and you should scan his main circa 6 minute mark(right when your second CC becomes an orbital)...if you scout 4 gate make another bunker and pull some scv's and set them to auto repair

what is your tvt build? If you go cloak banshees you become pretty safe to any 1/1/1 build and while you will behind economically to a 1 rax expanding terran i prefer the early tech in this matchup as you can put pressure with tanks on a 1 rax expander 




 orbital commands can not be loaded with scvs 




 i try this style but every time i do it i get over run by a cheap cheese or someone going mech. :( i think i may expand too fast? idk its not the build order i need inso much as the idea of how to play it...i feel at a lost. 




 So I'm a current [plat terran](http://sc2ranks.com/us/2781279/test_subject4671) and I do really well with tvp and tvz. For tvp I do the Puma 1 rax expand to 4 rax/3 gas build and for tvz I do the Polt double Ebay mass marine late tank early agression style. The problem is, with tvt i dont have a build that I feel comfortable doing.I've tried one rax expand, reaper expand, tank expand, banshee expand....i just dont feel comfortable(especially with the prevalence of two port cloaked banshee in plat league). What are some build you use? 




 i think the general consensus on this sub is the pure protein offers the best value/taste/macros 




 i uninstalled the old driver(using control pane;-remove programs lol) 




 i fell back to driver version 295.73 and that has at least been a work around to the issue for me
EDIT: apparently the current BETA driver will also solve this
