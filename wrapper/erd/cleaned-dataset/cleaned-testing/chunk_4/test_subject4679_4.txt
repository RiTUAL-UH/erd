 I agree - perfect for a 15 year old boy. Shakespeare does Stephen King. (Cue outraged gasps from purists.) 




 Hmm, maybe I should put (***JOKE***) beside some of my comments, as people seem to take them very seriously. But the older I get, the more I adopt the perspective of the adults in the play over RJ themselves, and see the perspective of the Friar, the long-suffering mother, and even the between-the-craziness affection but exasperation of the nurse. Especially the Friar (who is often portrayed as a dodderer, but the text gives him wisdom). The father I still can't sympathize much with. 




 Interesting to hear from someone who was in the room at the same time. I wonder if there are others who would like to chime in. Or who have seen other performances - maybe it was a bad night for the team? 




 The Festival Theatre is not a particularly small room, seating over 1800, but does have a terrific thrust stage with a 220 degree sweep of seats around it, and the distance to the stage from any seat is surprisingly short given the theatre's capacity.  See the photo in my original post to view the stage. 




 I'm always happy to be disagreed with, and readily acknowledge that I haven't seen a lot of OP productions. This one was directed by Tim Carroll, who I understand is not exactly a newbie to the genre, and to me and the people near me it fell flat with a fairly mighty whump. Critics who have seen many more plays that I have also seemed unimpressed. 

That said, much may have related to the level of the acting, which was somewhat uneven in this production.

In response to the comments about the importance of venue, I agree. Something might work at the Globe or Blackfriars, which are organized specifically for this kind of production. The Festival Theatre at Stratford is a magnificent theatre "machine", and I suspect some of the frustration has to do with having all of those resources (which, as I say in the article, Shakespeare would likely have drooled over) sit idle. Also, the OP format is itself artificial in that environment. They even had a complicated lighting arrangement carefully designed to simulate the gradual (and random) changes of light that might happen during an outdoor performance on a sunny afternoon. 




 Forgive my ignorance (which is limitless), but I'm not sure I understand your question. A three syllable cue before each line? Can you give an example?  









 PrettyCoolGuy:  I think this is a reasonable argument, but it's also difficult for any movie to represent every aspect of any minority if we accept that there is diversity within groups. If we portray a feminine gay man we may offend gay men who object that not all gay men are feminine; if we portray a very masculine one we can look androgyny-phobic. None of the movies on the list can reasonably claim to be fully representative of any community. I can't think of any others that are either. 




 I'm a psychologist who provides lgbt diversity education sessions for healthcare providers. These sessions are never as long as I'd like them to be, so I give lists of resources for people. I know they're not likely to plow through a long list of texts, so one of my lists is of popular movies.

A few of the films on the list I've also recommended to clients dealing with related issues, as an adjunct to therapy.

This is always a bit controversial, because we can find fault with almost any portrayal, but here's my list. Want to suggest more or comment on those on the list?

 Depression is such a difficult state that it attracts almost all of a person's attention. But making your life all about the problem can be depressing in itself. First I get up and take my pills (because I'm depressed), then I journal (because I'm depressed), then I go to my therapy session (because I'm depressed), then I listen to my relaxation CD (because I'm depressed), etc.

Sometimes it's useful to do some counterfactual thinking. "What if I WASN'T depressed? What might I be doing?" I ask clients to imagine they could eliminate depression with a snap of their fingers. (If only.) What does the good life after depression look like?

Then you can gradually begin aiming directly at that goal by doing some of those things, very gradually (after all, the depression hasn't actually vanished and is still slowing you down).
