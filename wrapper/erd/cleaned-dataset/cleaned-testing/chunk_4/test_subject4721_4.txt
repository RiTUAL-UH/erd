 Sorry buddy, but take plenty of pics and post the finished bed.:) 




 Did I just make a honey-do project for your husband. 




 I think it would make a great nap spot, bring a book with a small light and just doze off slowly. Sounds sweet right?  




 Try making whipped cream and adding it to that as a flavor, if you like it great if not so what! Bad whipped cream is just like bad pizza, even if it's bad it's still pretty good. 




 Brooklyn and two guys pop out immediately...   
Neighborhood Guy 1- Elderly Black man who jogs everyday, has to be in his 70's if not older and thin as a rail, emaciated really but he's out there every spring and summer, I can walk faster than he jogs but he's out there in the street all the time. Just saw him the other day. Knew winter was officially over.  
Neighborhood Guy 2- Elderly White man, he's over 6 feet and roller skates every day using a large pole to help navigate around. He collects cans and bottles and you can see him roller skating along holding a large bag of recycles in each hand. It's a sight to see. I haven't seen him in a while, hope he's ok. 




 Place everything you want to cook in a bowl. Using a nonstick pan, add a knob of butter and a 2 tbls of a good olive oil until it's shimmering then add your hash mix in large spoon fulls, and let it cook until a nice crust forms, lower heat, cover and cook until cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes depending on how thick the hash is. Remove from heat, place a large plate over hash, invert pan and hash should pop out onto dish. Serve in slices like a pie. I made a slow cooker pork shoulder not knowing it was St Pats day and with the left overs I just made a homemade Shepard's Pie. 







































 I'm happy that I had no idea who she was.

 The way they were filming this if Batman was in front you would not be able to see Robin. 





























 I'm thinking it was a girl friend of the girls who saw the guy checking out her friends while they were taking a picture of something on the table. Either that or the guys buddy who was trying to bust his balls.

 I like to post stuff that I like to subs that I like hoping other redditers will enjoy them as much as I do. I like /r/HistoryPorn and it's take on reposting, as long as it at least 3 months or more and it's not in it's top 100 it's ok. Nobody came to my defense when a redditer reposted my post with the same title, pic and to the same subreddit only 3 hours after my original post. In the end who cares? 



















 Da Vinci did a lot of work on comission and the Mona Lisa was one of them. If I remember correctly it was commissioned and paid for by her husband and he just kept it and added to it, changed it over the years.  









 Remember, he was paid a commission to paint the Mona Lisa by her husband and Da Vinci just kept it and kept adding to it for years after.  



















 Wow! Thanks.

 Don't you mean their Parliament? 




 Yea, it's worth it. Go early the first day, the grab bag will have free coffee and tea products as well as coupons. There will be a lot of fresh teas sold by the ounce as well as tastings. You will also find tea accessories, cups, thermos and other stuff as well. We lasted a long time on all the free tea bags we got from the last years, we just finished a few weeks ago. Give it a shot, the wife and I have fun.
