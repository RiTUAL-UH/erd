 everything looks great except for Iron Mans suit. Looks so photo shopped.  









 Titanic. But If I had to pick a recent score It would have to be Interstellar.  




 Its all about taste and all film is subjective. Your not going to like every single film.  









 just watching 1080p youtube videos id probably use that up in a few days.  









 Thor dies, Cap then gets to use the hammer? 




 I guess that makes sense. But Id hope that we would be able to figure out a way around that limiation.  



















 Oh god. this movie is gonna suck.  




 I think its been put on the shelf for now. My guess is Fox will wait and see how FF does before revisting it since Josh Trank will have also signed on to direct FF2. So we may not get a sequel till after FF2 and even then Trank has his star wars movie to do. So if Chronicle 2 does happen it wont be directed by Trank.  




 is that including spectre or still 2 more after spectre? 




 Ok seriously can we stop already?  





























 TL;DR LOL 




 This article is from last year. Old news.  




 If it still turns on you might just need to replace the hard drive. Or the hard drive could of come loose due to the amount of force. Open her up and check.  









 its cheap, constantly updated with new content. Its original content is even better than some of its licensed content (Looking at you House of Cards). Easy to switch regions with a VPN etc. Compatible with lots of devices. Its just that good.  




 Netflix.  














 You could try the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak  




 Damn that's complicated to look at.  




 Apparently its 145 minutes according to my local cinema. Just in case anyone wanted know.  




 Their laptops are actually decent.  




 Is still shit.  




 If Captain America: Civil War has spider-man I reckon it has a decent chance.  




 So the last episode was called the return and we got a surprise guest apperance from Manu Bennett as slade. The episode implied that Bennet was returning as Slade but he didn't really did he? he ended up back in Prison and imo It was more of a guest apperance than a return. A return to me would of been him escaping so he could of been used later on. I just found the episode title a bit misleading.
 









 Why didn't disney at least give the second one a go before canning the franchise? they could of at least wrapped up the story properly with one more film. And besides, It could of been one of those franchises that picked up steam through dvd,bluray and VOD sales. So much wasted potential. :(  




 A lot of people don't have the technical know how to figure out how to use Netflix,Hulu and torrents etc. Some people still cant afford internet. Also some people just prefer the social aspect of sitting down and watching TV with a bunch of friends rather than being anti social and watching it on a laptop or something. TV is a very social thing for a lot of people.  









 With all the spin offs and what not. When do you think disney will reveal the entire slate? perhaps at star wars celebration?  




 Is anyone else worried that Sony is selling off its TV and smartphone divisions and wants to invest more in PlayStation? I mean what if their investment fails to return a profit in 3-4 years time? would Sony consider selling the PlayStation brand as well? The last thing the gaming industry needs is a monopoly controlled by Microsoft. Nintendo really doesn't have any stake in the industry anymore like MS and Sony currently do. Would you guys still support PlayStation if it was purchased by another brand like Samsung? 














 Oooh season finale perhaps?  




 I mean come on. Do you really think CBS is just gonna let this show end? give it a year or two maybe three. But it will be back in some way. Mark my words this aint the last we've seen of it . 




 The new spider-man actor and director
Captain Marvel director
Infinity War director(s)?
Thor Ragnarok director
Black Panther director
Inhumans director
Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War
Agent Carter season 2
Agents of Shield season 3
New Avengers line up for infinity war

Did I miss anything?
 









 why not just download it all at once? its annoying when you have slow internet. Id rather wait a bit longer but at least be able to play it without interruption.  




 well thats stupid.  




 So I just started playing the order 1866 and I just watched the cut scene after you kill the lycan with the lightning gun and now the game seems to be downloading something again. its currently at 55% and 60 minutes remaining. wtf is going on?
 









 human centipede 




 There should at least be a temporary logo until an official one is released.  



















 its a tv show. the contract wont be that binding like it would for a movie.  




 there's nothing stopping it from happening. That's actually great casting.  




 I wanted spider-man back but not like this. Why move everything? they could of easily had another film in 2017. I'm happy civil war and guardians of the galaxy 2 seem unaffected though.  




 everyone noticed this. Your just late to the party.  




 They wont be taking money from each other. They are both Disney films. Disney would still get money ether way.  




 Why delay any of them? they would still make money. imagine the nerdgasms. Avengers and Star Wars a couple of months apart. Would be madness. But awesome madness.  




 Its not paid DLC for Unity. Its a complete game.  




 Oh god yes! but ONLY if the movie is ready in terms of VFX and editing and what not.  









 Not bad. Looks like your all set to go. Huge fan of those EVGA power supplies. So underrated, more people should use them.  




 So a week from now I'm considering upgrading my graphics card and with the launch of the 960 the price of the 760 will now drop. So I'm wondering do the new feature's and the performance increase of the 960 out way the benefits of a 760? or should I just go with the newer 960.  




 I like pc as much as consoles. Why is it wrong for someone to like both? Not only that I think its stupid to sell a console for a new pc case when the value of the console outweighs the value of a new case.
 




 nope.  




 I don't see how one can film a movie like that with at least some of the cast members feeling awkward on set. I mean what if they down right refused to film a sex scene because of how outrageous it was? I haven't heard anything like that happening for fifty shades just used it as an example. I'm just curious how a director would handle a film like this?  









 that's the most stupid idea ever heard. no way I would sell a ps4 for a case.  




 I can never understand these posts. if its your money just buy the damn case.  




 Netflix gets new episodes weekly.  




 it will be quicker than dude, have you ever use tpb before? its like 10 minutes tops after it airs.  




 so watch it later on netflix? 




 I think an official discussion then a late comers discussion would be good. But it might be a bit too much for the mods.  









 I mean unless they go back in time some how it doesn't make sense but this is moffat we are talking about how so ofc nothing is as it seems.  









 Walter White. All he wanted to do was secure a future for his family before he died and the only way he could think of doing that was by cooking meth.  









 Im more interested in the process behind how marvel got to where they are today. I really enjoyed how star wars conquered the universe because of that reason it went so in depth into how star wars got to where it is today.  









 So get this, In the newest trailer there is a shot of Jason stathams Ian Shaw blowing up a car, next shot you see Dominic looking all sad at a photograph of his family .I think Shaw kills Brian and Universal is hiding it pretty damn well. What do you think? Here's the sequence im talking about. http://imgur.com/a/s10Zi now this could be just the way the trailers cut but it seems kinda obvious now that Shaw will kill someone close to Dom whether its Brian I cant say for sure but why else have that shot with the family photo with Brian in the center? 




 aye you see them plenty in both of the trailers. calm down. They are a major part of the plot they were even in the winter soldier post credit scene.  




 I might have been living under rock but I haven't seen this yet. Should I check it out? 




 that was more of a joke than a controversy tbh. North Korea just got Butt hurt someone decided insult their great leader.  




 I would of thought Selma would of gotten more controversy due the subject of the film but man American Sniper, It seems like every day a new article pops up adding more fuel to the fire. Are there any films as controversial as American Sniper? 




 it was announced by fox ages ago along with a march 2017 release date for another wolverine sequel.  




 Since when do you tip Pizza deliveries? we dont in NZ.  




 Heading there on Wednesday for the first time. Staying for a week. Any thing a first time visitor should do and places to check out? 




 I liked interstellar's theory on this. In the movie they claim that the U.S faked the moon landings to bankrupt the soviet union.  



















 Did a quick Google didn't find anything.  



















 Poltergeist. If you never want to sleep again.  




 you wot m8? your complaining about 250fps? wow.  









 . Windows server 2008 data center can handle up to 2tb of ram.

 It might go better than you think it will. I've heard stories of  EVGA sending back newer models of their card because its no longer in production. You might get back ether a 760 or 960.  




 actually can its called IGN 




 GTX 960.  









 Yep lol.  




 CW YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY! 




 Oh yes. That star trek trailer was amazing. The way they cut the trailer to Freedom Fighters from Two Steps From Hell. Still gives me chills.  




 I got mine from study link. Here in New Zealand .Its basically a subsidiary set up by the government and offers interest free student loans. You can also get a student allowance which is free but is dependent on how much money your parents make which will impact how much you get per week. Or you can get living costs which you have to pay back on top of your student loan up to $175 a week.  














 Good way to look at imo. The i7 will be able to play newer games longer than the i5.  




 eh? both are solid ports imo. They did have resolution issues at launch but I'm pretty sure they have been patched now.  



















 I cant take anyone seriously when they start their argument with "fuck" 









 All film is subjective. Gourlami is allowed to like wolverine origins if he wants.  




 I love that line. Don't know why. Just do.  




 Damn this looks good. Might be more hyped for this than Age of Ultron.  




 its still too early. It aint out till march next year.  









 Aint happening, any talk of a sequel died when the abysmal box office numbers came in for the second film.  




  Im guessing with Age of Ultron? I'm seriously hyped for this movie. I want to see more.  









 Since Marvel don't seem interested to back a big budget film for the Hulk, why not go the Netflix route? Del Toro was already working on a live action tv show for ABC haven't heard anything in a while tho. Maybe they could jump start it again now that they have Ruffalo? 




 I cant find any copies online and normally its up by now. Anyone know whats going on? it did air today right? 
























 Well this is interesting. 

http://blog.ubi.com/ubisoft-quebec-studio-spotlight/ 









 lol bs pics or it didn't happen.  




 if you compare the figure on the far left to how Paul actually looks in the scenes he did manage to get filmed you'll see he looks nothing like the figure. The figure is far to thin and the head just looks wrong. plus its awkwardly placed away from the rest of the cast. It must be one of his brothers who then had their head switched out with Paul's during post.  














 Its beautiful.  




 did you even watch the first movie? Dom and his crew were pulling of heists all the time like stealing dvd players and shit.  




 Big hero 6 




 Are people still pissed that superman killed zod? Personally I'm ok with it. I mean, if he didn't kill Zod, Zod would of killed the family and then kept on killing people. Zod left superman no choice. I get that superman killing people is wrong and goes against everything he stands for but I think it was an interesting and ballsy take on the character by Snyder. What do you guys think? 




 So this semester I have to get a laptop. I'm pretty much settled on the Asus ROG G551JM. Just wanted to see what people here thought of asus laptops. Are they of good build? do they last long etc? 




 How does Disney proceed with the franchise? do they keep going and try and make episode 8 better? or do they scrap the franchise completely? id assume they would keep going because they've poured to much money in to it already it would be pointless to stop.  









 2 years is the norm for marvel films, whats so unusual about it? 3 years your starting to get the point where fans will be complaining there taking too long.  




 Jaws 




 Best thing would be some chocolate bars, and whipped cream.  














 I think you should wait for amd to announce the 300 series. the 300 series might end up being better than the Nvidia's 900 series. Dont just jump on the nvidia bandwagon because everyone else is . Just my 2 cents.  









 we run windows. Decent size screen would be nice 15.6-17inch, light to medium gaming so some mobas,cs go, f2p games like nosgoth, the ocasional AAA title like tomb raider etc. No special ports required. Portability would be nice i don't want anything to heavy.  









 Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having an i7? I thought i7's were meant to be quad cores?  




 I'm not afraid to admit that ive done this, a few of my facebook posts ive posted were to try and make me seem cool but I failed pretty hard.  




 I've had a couple of pavilion laptops over the past 4 years both died due to over heating issues. Is this still a thing? or should the pavilion line up be avoided like the plague and is it worth stepping up to the Hp's envy laptops? 





























 Stephen king's the dark tower comes to mind. I have little faith the movie will be any good if and when ever it gets made its just so complex.  




 I mean why does avatar need 3 god damn sequels and we cant get one battle angel movie :(  




 Apollo 13 




 Looking for something that takes a scientific approach yet has all the fun of a good ghost scary ghost hunt. 

 




 How are they not done filming yet? WTH.  









 No, they clearly state that recommended specs will run at 30. Read again. All tho they say they are aiming for the most performance possible for now it looks like recommended specs will run at 30.  




 Here's the link to the original polish interview. 

http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=1132


PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second? 

I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better. 









 You sure that's it? I thought it was the plane that looked like the plane bane used from the dark knight rises? 




 should of got it directly from steam 




 yea its bullshit. 









 Ok I stand corrected. But usually the oscars do seem to prefer the higher rated films.  




 My computer will probably catch fire trying to play this.  




 I loved episode 3. Saw it 5 times when it came out. I still get chills when Anakin turns to the dark side.  




 It wasn't rated high enough on rotten tomatoes. sad but true. The oscars seem to favor movies rated 85-100% anything lower doesnt get recognized.  









 err how does she know when its your birthday? 




 what did she do then? when she found out one of her kids did it? 




 I have a 360,Wii,Ps3,Ps4,Xbox one and I think I have an N64 and PS2 around some where. Plus my gaming pc ofc. 




 same, here's how Id do it. At the end of AOU Banner is shot into space after cap and falcon break him out of a government holding cell set up by stark after banner looses control of the hulk, cap tells banner that its the only way hell remain free but cap tells banner hell call upon him when hes needed again.Eventually his craft crashes into Knowhere, Banner makes his way out of the crashed craft he looks up we see groot smiling at him and he says I am groot, end scene.  









 That's bullshit, I mean unless said third party stole the keys then they should be legit. wtf Ubisoft.  




 Anyone got a decent 24/7 OC going on this card? looking to OC to try and improve performance on some newer games that are coming out.  




 Ant-Man got pushed forward from November to July.  




 Wow. That's huge! Paramount must be well ahead of schedule for a drastic move like this.  




 I think this scene is really important. It tells you up front what phase 2 is about. It even foreshadows the events that occurred in the winter soldier with hydra being mentioned and how they will use weapons of mass destruction on civilians.  









 I preodered it you mad.  




 we don't know this yet, Bucky could still play a major role in civil war especially if stark finds out he killed his father.
