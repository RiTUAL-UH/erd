 Both servers were driving distance from where I was staying. In fact, the servers both claimed to be in the same city. Would have kept the cities in the image, but according to [Da Rules](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140907220547/infusiongaming/images/4/47/Da_Rules.jpg) all personally identifiable information has to be removed :( 














 When deciding on passwords, what would you recommend to do to make them as secure as possible? (Outside of password managers) 




 That's a fake (footage from games) 









 Yep, I've done all of that and it's still draining just as fast.  Worried now it might be a physical issue with the battery.  Gonna try to call Motorola tomorrow since they put me on hold for an hour today T_T 




 After the most recent, my moto360 started having great battery life.  Then, randomly this past weekend, it's life shot way down.  It only lasts for a max of 5 hours now.  Has anyone had this issue?  No settings have changed, and even untethering it from my phone kills it in the same amount of time.

Edit: After sending it back to Motorola and getting a new one, the issue has been resolved.  If you experience battery issues like this with a moto360, it might be worth calling support as this seems to be a hardware issue with the batteries where it can't hold a charge long enough essentially. 




 The Star Wars prequels are awful 




 Depending on the cost I may be interested. You have a cost estimate so far?
