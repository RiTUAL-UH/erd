 Should have stuck out your hand and introduced yourself. You play it off until she asks if she knows you. At which point you just say you noticed her and remember someone calling her name the other day. 




 Truth! 




 TL;DR Alabama threads the letter of the law and bans gay marriage licences, not gay marriages. 




 Comcast is the ONLY ISP in Knoxville,TN.
My word! Why isn't the government providing internet connectivity hardware as infra, and having whatever private company provide the actual service? This lowers the cost of entry and eliminates this horrid monopoly.  




 Yes.  




 Are we to assume there were no animals alive way back when and are no longer in existence today that we just haven't found yet! I ask because urban assuming the myth stems from seeing fossil. 
Equally plausible is a low intellectual flight of fancy and embellished stories. 
So if a dragon is a misunderstood dinosaur or embellished actual creature gone extinct then we can strip out the frippery. Per the myths: flying dinosaur isn't mythical, we have other examples; fire breathing is perhaps a stretch; magical will be subjective since fire would have been magical to early men anyhow. So it appeared magical given what was comprehensible at the time. 
Per embellished fable, which I'm more inclined to accept: flying creature is reasonable since there are/were plenty of those; fire breathing is still a stretch but spitting toxic venom that burns as fire, or something of that nature is not impossible. We have electric eels, chameleons that change color and vipers that spit venom, these are actually more fantastic than spitting venom. Magical powers in the eyes of early men... 
Still, after we strip away the fellowship in both cases, you still have a creature like millions of others in existence or already extinct.  




 I can understand the stories about dragons being myth, but how does that make the idea of the animal itself a myth? Isn't that throwing the baby out with with the bath water?  



















 Excellent thoughts on the article. I'll state first of all that I do feel that fossil fuels have their value and use. But I'm not sure this is it. While it is not feasible to wean ourselves off fossil based raw materials (and there are innumerable implications), i do feel that there is always more than one way to skin a cat if you will. 
Ever single application or fabrication that requires fossil fuels can be sourced through one natural, sustainable means or the other. We either haven't found it yet, or we are leaning on the ease of what is readily available at the cost of the very planet we live in.
His, Mr. Gates's approach is one of accelerating the discovery or development of these alternative options, and my hats go off to him and everyone else putting even a penny into this research. 




 The refusal to use commas makes it so confusing to read.  




 'They' can't be greedy because technically, there is no 'they'. 




 Fracking is as clean as the air in China (no offense). There is nothing clean about consuming fossil fuels at the rate we are consuming. And as technology develops, we simply are unable to sustain it. The world is quivering right now and so far we only have people in the US and a few other developed countries to account for. What happens when all of Africa comes online? What about rural China? What happens when they too start to consume at the rate the average American does. See the reason for panic yet? 




 What do you mean 60-70 of 'THE people'? 




 I'm sorry, but when you take one statement and criticize it out of context, you kind of loose credibility.
Your response doesn't sound like you read or understood any of what I said. As evidenced from your very last sentence, which seems to capture exactly what I was trying to convey.... 




 Well, is have to kill you first. But then, the next guy would also require proof. And since you no longer have a physical body with which to communicate, you can't tell him otherwise.
For me it makes more sense since it explains much of the suffering that happens in the world. The way I see it, you have 3 choices:
1. Complete randomness. Which actually doesn't exist since everything has some mathematical it logical prices.
2. The Christian version of a God, who acts arbitrarily. See ops post.
3. Or some well defined laws that govern everything. Including the cycle of human existence which includes birth, death, and rebirth. Having to pay for every single act that you put out. 




 A note to all of you:
Understand the concept of reincarnation and reciprocal action. What you sow you MUST reap.
I read here, questions about how you can reconcile forgiveness, acts such as the Nazi holocaust, and someone  suffering from cancer.
Here is a plot twist for the ages: what if it was Hitler or his kin who is now in this present life suffering from cancer. 

And the idea that your sins just disappear because you profess some belief or other is illogical. The same book tells you that you must reap what you have sown. So the only way it makes sense is to understand that even after you repent, you will receive forgiveness after you have made good every single act of wickedness. That is true Justice! And only after having made good your wrongs and keeping with your promise to turn a new leaf, naturally, you are forgiven as if nothing ever happened. Because you have made right your wrong! 




 That's because it is all wrong. Simple answer. No such nonsense took place. 




 Your opinion is duly noted. 




 No, it's respect. You should try it. 




 Because, you know, since they lied about how they murdered him in cold blood, they couldn't possibly be lying about that. You only get one lie pet incident, right? 




 News flash, we needn't imagine such a scenario. We are living in it. 




 The only part I agree with us the part that your suggestions will never happen. You need a good people for that to happen. But if you had a good people, you wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. The system will inevitably collapse on itself. That much is for certain 




 Actually, this happens to every one. 




 Well I'd rather they fear us that the status quo 




 It's the problem with capitalism.
FTFY. 




 It is sad that we all don't see this as a collective problem. But your words remind me if something I read a while ago. 
Until we build our own networks and patronize them, we will never have a voice. And no, BET did not count. 









 Guys, this is important.
I'm not anti-capitalist or anything... who am I kidding: I am as anti-capitalist as they come. Why, because philosophically speaking, the most profitable enterprise is no different from slavery. If you strip away all the frippery, you are left with something very close to that.
It dictates that our actions are driven by what is most profitable. How can such a concept ever be good? Shouldn't we always do what is right and what serves the greater 'good'? This is what is best. And it is almost always in conflict with what is profitable.

Freeing ourselves from dependence on carbon and other fuels will usher in an immense upheaval in human life as we know it. Just imagine not having to depend on anything or anyone for energy. Then we can actually begin to do quite wonderful things. Think of it, near zero restrictions on energy supply...
 
 




 I feel like I gained weight and am at an increased risk for a heart attack for just watching that. 




 Did you read the article? We need to move away from fossil fuel. It is high time we dramatically increase our focus on research and ideas on renewable energy. You are reading it wrong. What you are interpreting this as is "just cut off the lights".
No! It reads "let us make the use of alternative renewables as our primary source of energy a number one priority and spare nothing in this effort."
The pope is not a scientist. When Kennedy said, let's go to the moon. I can hear your same attitude asking 'how does he suggest....'. He wasn't a scientist. He simply insisted we make it a number 1 priority. That really is all. 




 I'm not sure what your criteria is but this is about the response of Jeb bush, a us presidential candidate to the popes announcement. 
You really should read the article before make such decisions.  














 Where is the decency in this world. At this rate, there will soon be no reasons to wear any clothes at all. Then you'd hear lamentations about how that every guy you encounter only seems to have sex on his mind. ... Go figure. 




 What does it matter? You and I exist and are subject to the laws of nature whether we choose to believe them or not. So again, what does it matter what we believe or don't believe.
I don't believe in gravity. That will not stop me from plummeting to my death of I took a step off a ledge.
I believe I can fly... Same result.
What you say you believe is of little or no importance.
What actually is of value is recognizing the laws that govern the world we live in and adjusting our lives so that we fit into them. And this is actually to our own personal benefit. Otherwise, we will achieve the same result as in the previous examples above.
