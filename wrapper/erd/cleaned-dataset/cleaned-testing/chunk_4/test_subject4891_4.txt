 So could I perhaps use the equation y=16x+62. It's a linear equation, and I need to graph it. 




 Can you explain just a tad bit further? 




 The goal is to create a scenario which can be graphed using a linear-function. 
  My scenario is "Poncho Villegas is a soldier who needs to capture a fort. He needs 600 troops to do so, and currently only has a company of 62 soldiers. He receives a platoon of 16 troops each day. How many days will elapse before Poncho has the required force to conquer the fort?"

How might I solve this? I am having trouble puting this in linear function/equation form. Help me, r/ Homeworkhelp. 




 Wow! Nice to know someone is as interested as me in this effect! Do you have a video tutorial? 




 Low quality pictures yes I know, please acknowledge these were taken with laptop cameras. 









   I have seen Tron and Tron: Legacy. I always loved the derez effect. Whether it was evaporation or programs shattering into thousands of cubical vowels. 
  I have also seen a few episodes of VGHS, and the derez effect is also pretty cool. 
  If you were creating a movie which has a plot centered around a vidya gam or a computer, how would you recreate this effect?

 Kinect 




   Could you use it for motion capture and then somehow port it to Maya for animation? 




 Wow! I know what route I'm taking! 














 Alright, what about this.

I really want this site to be legit. I am looking for cheap prices to buy After Effects, 3ds Max, and Autodesk Maya. That is my dilemma. I want to buy these usually expensive softwares for $150-$400. 




 It is certified by McAfee though. 




 It was tested with McAfee though. It looks legitimate.

 Oh. Might you be able to clear these misconceptions up? All I want in my vfx work is photorealism. 




 Wow! Might I inquire what software you used to create 3d models in this wonderful render? 









 I really thought Tau Ceti was a good candidate? 




   Seriously. Every comedy related sub has a rule against memes and rage comics and posting such on a social network is considered "shit posting." 




   It's basically a cheaper version of Maya. I'm assuming it can render simulations? 




 Thanks! 


































   I think it will be around $200. 




 I'm sorry good fellow, but I do not believe there were any birds (Assuming you are denoting to the branch of Archosaurs) in the videos I had seen. 




 What might you mean, good sir?
