 "not that bad" is still probably not going to win more than 20-23 games; which is actually really bad. 




 1. A hornbook could set you back another 150 bucks. Any sort of E E will set you back ~50. If he's including other things that weren't included (law in a flash- flash cards) that's another 40-50. 

2. New books here are around 180; I think 150 is an underestimate. Granted, I still think 9,000 is really stretching it. I'm probably spent 2500 as a 1L, 1500 as a 2L, and will spend about 800 as a 3L. If I had gotten every textbook + recommended hornbook + E E + some nutshell + law in a flash for all classes in which they were recommended, I think I could have broken 9k.

3. American books are much prettier than their Australian counterparts. 




 x_x sorry about this thread then. 









 For some reason, all the thrift stores I've been to here in my city are all extremely poor quality, I've lost faith in local thrift shopping. 




 laughs at you for using 'relevancy'

feels like an idiot after discovering relevancy is a word. 




 I'm looking to accumulate ~4 Fair Isle sweaters that are 'fashionably ridiculous' for this fall; but it's hard to track down a decent variety. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or any absurd ones they've recently come across? 




 I'm wondering this too. 




 Then we blow like... four. 




 I feel like dark shades of blue usually work best with light/medium grey. So a light grey v-neck sweater, nice blue jeans and some leather shoes. Or maybe a grey blazer with a white button down underneath. 




 Excellent. Thanks a ton. I found [these](http://www.florsheim.com/shop/style/18150-03.html) on florsheim, but they look too shiny. Is there any specific type of material I should be looking for in a shoe that is basically signifies it doesn't have a formal-shoe level of shine to it? 




 Inspiration is this- http://i.imgur.com/rh8IW.jpg

I've found these- http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/allen-edmonds-clifton-oxford/2892042?origin=category contextualcategoryid=0 fashionColor=WALNUT resultback=0 but on a student living budget, it's *really* difficult to justify the price. Does anyone know where I can find something very close in looks for around 150-200? Or maybe know of a good place to buy used Allen Edmonds?

I especially enjoy the walnut color and the simplicity of the toe. Unlike the 'strand' oxfords. 




 I think it was the "streets of new york" part that made everyone think he was asking for it, rather than "what kind of shoes would work with this suit". 




 At least you *can* beat bad teams. 




 That's.. ummm... overaggressive, don't you think? 




 Medium. 




 Definitely extra slim. I'm 6'3 150 and extra slim is still a little baggy on me, but that's the skinniest they have. If you get a small it'll be about 1.5 inches too short on the sleeves. 




 6'3 150 checking in. Life is not fun. 




 Ours is pretty easy to justify-

1. We were going to have an awesome 2nd week game with West Virginia... then they bailed.
2. Florida, obviously our yearly rival game
3. USF was also *supposed* to be at least a decent-level FBS opponent
4. Murray State- every team is allowed 1 cupcake 




 Hey buddy, relax. If we're better than the three teams ahead of us, it'll show up as the season progresses. No need to pitch a fit about only being ranked 4th in the 4th week of the season. 




 Wait, what? Wake is 3-1 with a win over UNC, no less. Boston College is the 'lol' team of our division. 




 Errr, that sounds nice, but it's more just that those specific games were historically significant. For instance [the choke at doak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_at_Doak). 




 Depends on the occasion. For a business/professional/interview event, both of them are too informal and will look bad with a suit. For a less formal occasion; you might have some leeway, but you'd have to post pictures of the suit, and I get the feeling they probably won't.  




 Agree with you on the first paragraph. Still think it looks sophomoric and ugly on OP. 




 FSU returned a lot more starters than Clemson did though. 




 You're violating the spirit of the thread bro. 




 Or. Maybe he's just a dumb troll. 




 Typically when you join a society, there will be networking events with accountants there from all the firms (big 4, GT, BDO etc.) This is nice because building a repertoire with recruiters and accountants can only ever help you. 

At worst, you're going to have a better looking resume by joining a society, and by going to these events you'll get insights and advice that will make you a better interviewee. Ask them what they want in an intern/hire- then convey those traits back to them during your interview with the firm.

At best, your relationships will directly affect whether you get an interview or not; and you could even have already established a professional friendship with the guy who interviews you or one of your callback partners.

You *really* want, when your resume is being reviewed, to have the recruiter (or whoever) to look at your application and say "240drift is a sociable and easy to talk to person who asks intelligent questions and seems to enjoy this profession" instead of "I have no clue who this is, despite appearing on his campus multiple times, so we'll just have to screen him solely on the merits of this piece of paper." The odds of you getting an internship/callback/offer with the former is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the latter, when you have a bare-bones resume and only your gpa working for you. Remember that your gpa is a part of your resume, not the whole thing. Why risk something as monumentally important as post-graduation employment by only having a partially good resume?

Would I really have THAT much trouble finding a good job after I graduate if all I have are my grades?

Think about it like if you were considering asking a girl to be your girlfriend, where GPA=looks. You have a certain threshold, and the more attractive she is than that threshold the more you want her. But you're going to be committed to a serious relationship, if she has absolutely no personality, no mental stability, and when making the choice to pursue her you don't know anything about her past and if she has any baggage, you'll probably want to stay away in spite of her good looks; afterall, you have your pick of girls, so you can take one that's not quite as cute but has a solid 9-5 job and you know is fun to be around. Just like an accounting firm- your gpa will make you attractive to them because you're probably above their threshold; but with *no* extracurriculars and no volunteer work working for you, and no idea who you are outside of this piece of paper you've sent in to be reviewed- they're going to be a lot more hesitant to consider you for this relationship, and probably settle for someone else.

I know the abstract idea of networking gets pounded into the heads of college students; and it's either scares them, or they decide in their infinite wisdom that it's not worth it. But in the world of job efficacy, this is the lowest hanging fruit out there.

tl;dr- Join your schools accounting society, put on a button down shirt, paste a smile on your face, and meet people. You'd be foolish not to, it makes a huge difference. 




 To be fair; the code of federal securities law is, in my opinion, considerably more difficult than the tax code. And the SEC administering is considerably less efficacious than the IRS. So when the general sentiment is that people hate the current code; I can understand strong feelings against sec. reg. 




 Ever heard of a dude named Steve Spurrier? 




 I'm 6'2 155 pounds, and almost all dress shirts I try on fit my frame but are too short in the torso and sleeves, or are long enough on the measurements but hang off of me like a parachute. 

I know BrooksBrothers has a decent extra-slim fit line, because my only three good dress shoots are from there. But I'm looking for some other lines of shirts that fit slim for the extra-lanky of us. I couldn't find anything in the sidebar or the (awful) search function.

Does anyone have any shirt lines that are good for us toothpicks?

Edit: and to go a step further, I'm especially looking for a light blue button down, but any general brand suggestions would be great. 




 You sound childish. 




 1) I only mentioned that because you said creaming 2 FCS schools doesn't tell you anything, you failed to mention we also creamed an FBS opponent that was 2-0, including a win against an ACC rival. Oregon, Oklahoma, West Virginia, all have considerably more shaky bodies of work right now.

2) I never said the transitive property doesn't exist. Good teams have bad games and lose by small margins to vastly inferior teams. VT got soundly worked, and clearly lost in the trenches to a team that, going into this game, had two pathetic losses. Having VT still ranked right now is just absurd. 




 How? between the 6 opponents of our two teams, Wake has been by far the strongest, and we just absolutely crushed; whereas oregon is giving up 24 points a game to Tennessee Tech, Arkansas State, and Fresno state.

And another: we've outscored Oregon so far this year too. 




 To be fair. FSU isn't the team spotting 34 points to FCS schools 




 How did you have FSU ranked 22nd preseason?? 




 1. Wake Forest could probably tell you a little bit

2. You failed to mention in there that they lost to a team that got whooped by Youngstown State. You have enough information to know that other teams have lost to much better quality opponents then freaking 1-2 pittsburgh.  




 Wat. We beat a conference opponent, a 2-0 conference opponent, who had another win against another conference opponent UNC. We beat them 52-0. We out-gained them in yardage 612 to 126. We held the 'quarterback of  week 2 in the ACC' to 8/22 for 82 passing yards. We held them to 1.2 yards per rush, and that includes a 34 yard run 2 minutes into the game.

52-0 dude. 




 I hate to leach off the main question- but I'm way too poor for the near future to afford boots like these. Does anyone know where I can find something that looks very similar but less? Or is this just the expected price to pay for a pair of boots.

Edit: I should clarify that I'm in love with that color scheme of the leather/soul/laces specifically; moreso than the exact shape of the boot. 




 Yep. Overall the suit looks very sloppy. I'll add that it's noticeably more tight around the stomach than it is where the vents are, making the whole lower half of the suit curve weird. 

Combined with the fact that it's a three button suit... eh, I wouldn't wear it. 




 FSU-UF

1. One of the best rivalries in the nation

2. Ee went through four humiliating years of getting trounced by them, and then once we got our act together they just completely lost their offense and we've trounced them right back. This year I think is the first time we get a really sweet game between the two teams in close to a decade.

3. The gators could plausibly be the last great stand preventing us from going to the NCG, which would exponentially increase the stakes of the game, and could make or break both of our seasons.

 This is exactly what I'm thinking too. Clemson's D doesn't look so great, I think FSU can put up a lot on them. But then Clemson has so many goddamn frightening offensive weapons, there's no way we're keeping the score low, nation's best defense or not. 

But now I feel like a homerdouche and a jinxer by picking my team to win by 24 over a top-ten ranked opponent, so I'm not sure.  




 I love you. 




 Those light brown shoes behind the row of cordovans. Can you tell me where you got those, and/or if they're online somewhere? 




 To be fair. FSU *hammered* an AQ team that's looking to be decent this season. 




 I will never for the life of me understand why that wasn't a complete pass. 




 I remember hearing that a lot about a year ago too :( 




 Right, everyone knows we're going to be playing Oklahoma; the key piece to our 2011 vengeance tour. 




 Living in Georgia now for two years; and frequent Alabama- Tallahassee is worse than both by a non-negligent amount. 




 No way. Yuffie has the best date scene, because it's so awkward between them.

Yuffie fo life. 




 Depends on what school you're at. 




 This is much much more truthful than the comment you were responding to, thank you. 




 So were the two clauses immediately preceding it.

*cough* spotting bowling green two legitimate touchdowns *cough* 




 It might just be the lighting, but those shoes look too shiny to match that outfit. Pre-distressed jeans look bad, go for a darker color. Shave. Overall not bad though. 




  T-shirts (and probably all upper wear) fitting is 95% in the shoulders.

Sadly, this varies. As a lanky 6'2 150 pound male, I'm constantly running into either a) having a shirt fit perfectly in the cut and the shoulders, only to find that it's way too short in the torso, often ending at the very top of the belt *or* b) having the shirt fit in the shoulders and be long enough, only to hang off my body like I'm wearing a camping tent. 




 I've actually been looking for a reasonably priced blazer like that for a while now... so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd be all ears. 




 Ponder isn't looking very accurate. Does not feel good man :/ 




 Holy hell they did it!!!! 




 Might want to switch to something harder soon. 




 My second favorite team this week! 




 A 6 minute mile is absolutely not even remotely difficult for a trained runner at the college or highschool level. Probably 75-80% of all track distance runners at the highschool level can break 12 for the 2 mile.

 Three in one game! His career is **over**. 




 Can you be a little bit more specific- what prep books did you use for which sections? Were they sufficient? Where were they lacking? 




 I'm in grad school and I'd like to get my CPA for a tertiary purpose, and I qualify to sit for my state's exam. I'm a very proficient self-studier, but I'm on a student's budget which means that I can't afford Becker's full review course. Ever something like Yaeger which is $1800 is a huge financial strain to me.
I saw that Wiley's review is absurdly cheap (150 for the whole thing), but given the price, I'm extremely skeptical of its quality as a good comprehensive review course.
Do you think it's reasonably doable, given that I put in the necessary time, to pass the four sections with this book alone? If not, would anybody want to recommend some of the next-cheapest alternatives? Thanks in advance for your help. 




 I'm in law school-

1. Corporate law, or any transaction field of law is very difficult to get into with the way the legal market is right now. I'd say over 50+% of all 3rd year students are struggling to find *anything* at graduation, must less a job in a transaction field. This is exacerbated for areas like corporate because the majority of corporate legal work is done at "biglaw" firms, which are the highest paying and most prestigious places to go after law school. 

2. Because of that, and because of the esoteric highering model of biglaw firms going after the best schools, while shunning lower ranked schools (see [here](http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202483173162 LAW_SCHOOLS_REPORT) for a ranking of the top-50 schools by biglaw hiring rate), I would argue that you'd be wasting an enormous amount of time and money by going to law school unless you attend one near the top.

3. Fortunately or unfortunately, law school admissions is very very heavily dependent on your "numbers" (that is, your GPA and your LSAT score). See for instance- http://gulc.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats. The graphs will give you an idea first of how closely correlated numbers are with admissions, and second what kind of stats you'll need to be competitive at the harder schools. You can also start seeing things like how Northwestern loves a high LSAT + work experience while UVA loves gpa.

4. My advice would be to talk to people in the profession about what the profession is like; get general knowledge and try and educate yourself as to whether or not you want to be a corporate lawyer. If you decide you do, take the LSAT, and study for it like *crazy*. The LSAT is a very learnable test, and spending tons of time working through the [powerscore bibles](http://www.amazon.com/PowerScore-LSAT-Logic-Games-Bible/dp/0980178207) (which, unlike what you'll find with the CPA, is actually the universal consensus credited study guide) and taking 25-30 practice tests (they publish actual old exams for pretty cheap) you can go from being awful to doing quite well. Granted, this alone is going to take 2-3 hours of study a day for about 4 months; but you'd be a fool not to put in the time because a single LSAT point can be the difference between admission and waitlist/rejection from the school you want to get into.

All in all, it's a long and arduous journey, so best of luck to you. 




 As someone who's generally very shy and introverted; this is a huge fear of mine. Would love to hear feedback. 




 Hell, I'd take Jameer Nelson, Jose Calderon, Lin, Jennings, Jarrett Jack, Rodney Stucky, Tyreke Evans, Darron Collison, Dragic, and Kemba Walker over Chalmers too. 




 I would disagree with your disagreement of yourself. You gave some specific examples of some of the types of problems that pervade poor and minority ethnicities in America.

I think it's just important for people to understand that, while obviously this is not true for everyone within any disadvantaged ethnicity, and while people definitely are able to overcome those disadvantages, there should be *nothing* controversial about suggesting that when you have these debilitating factors occurring at a much higher rate, you're going to have issues like crime, STD transmission, and poverty rising at a higher rate.

It's also important for people to not ignore or be ignorant to the lack of culture that we established, and the intensity of the systematic discrimination for black people specifically that disallowed them to just "overcome" these disadvantages like other ethnicities have (asian populations in california etc.) 




 False. The Beatles were considerably more influential. 




 This for some reason makes me think of two guys work in finance. One tells the other to "run to biglaw." As though either are a reasonably easily achievable option for someone to just run to. 




 Not to mentioned, that idea is only about about 6 minutes worth of show. 




 I'm not annoyed by them, it's just an 'aww that's cute' sentiment. I still remember [making memes](http://i.imgur.com/5ddfY.jpg) as a 1L. 




 1. How are you going to do this when the professor assigns "pages 43-87" in the reading? 




 Here come the 1L memes. 




 ESPN's Sports Science is one of the more stupid things that has ever existed. 




 Yep, pushes the movie to be being too long in length, and the french plantation just doesn't fit with the rest of movie. I'm glad it was left out. 




 I agree, and I upvoted for that excellent response. I was just merely explaining his PER. 




 Sounds like a British person came up with that quote to make us think they did anything.  




A^M^E^RICA!!!!!!

Edit: Joke people. I was joking. I know British intelligence played a huge part in WWII 




 Affalo may score close to 20ppg, just because the Magic are starving for a scoring option. But to be masochistic about this season- he still had a below average PER, and taken in concert with the fact that when he was on the floor last year the Nuggets allowed 106.11 points per 100 possessions, and when he was on the bench they allowed 103.6; which makes me think he's not that great of a defender in spite of his reputation.

Aside from that, I think the Bobcats are hard to say because nobody has any clue how good of a player MKG is going to be next year, we have no bearing on him in the NBA. The Sun's Gortat is probably the single most underrated center in the league; he fits the position of a classic big man extremely well in decent blocking, great rebounding, and a very respectable set of post moves. I think he's one of the top-5 centers in the league.

So I think the Magic have a good chance of winning this competition. 




 I'd put Jefferson and Monroe above both Hibbert and Lopez. 




 First let me say that I love Rondo, and he's much much better than his PER; but it goes deeper than just him being a distributing PG. I'm going to focus on the negative aspects of his game, but I'll say up front that I love him and still think he's one of the 3-4 best pg's in the league regardless.

So. Rondo has a low shooting rate, sure, but that's for two good reasons. The first is that he's always had great scoring options around him, the big 3. That's a definite reason his PER is lower but is not a detriment to his ability as a player.

The second, and very damning reason, is that he's not a good scorer.  His true shooting percentage is *terrible* for a point guard. Rondo has the lowest TS% percentage of all 30 point guards who are above the league average (15) in PER. Amongst those 30, and excluding John Lucas who played less than 15mpg, the next lowest is John Wall who is still a considerable .019 above him. And the fourth worst of those 30, Tyreke Evans, shot  .029 above him, which is quite a wide chasm.

His fg%, while not awful, is still below average, and that's taking into account the fact that he can't stretch the floor with threes, and his mid-range game is still very weak. It's even less pretty considering how little comparative defensive attention he gets because, as mentioned above, he has such a wealth of scoring options around him. If he were to carry a greater offensive onus for his team, it would probably be even lower. Even worse than that, his free throw shooting is *horrendous*. Below 60% last season. That ranks him 116th out of 119 players last season who shot enough free throws for a statistically qualifying sample. The next lowest point guard, Devin Harris, shot 15% better than him from the line.

His inability to score hurts triply so 1. Because coaches will smartly not put him in an offensive scheme to be used as a scoring option, because he's so inefficient 2. TS% is directly taken into account for PER 3. scoring is the strongest way to affect your PER.

So while Rondo is the perfect example of the ways in which PER can be "broken", the reasons his PER are low do represent legitimate and serious shortcomings to him as a player. I think the general sentiment is that they are way overblown as a numerical representation of his shortcomings, and I tend to agree with that. 




  talk to a lawyer

There it is. 




 and rebounds, which I don't think many people quantify as an offensive statistic. 




 Aaaaaand his posts are gone. 




 Could be worse. 




 When do the results come out? 




 Yep. Our franchise doesn't suck at all. Even during that down period after shaq in the early 2000's we could have very easily established an awesome team with Tmac, Grant Hill, Horace Grant, Darrell Armstrong, and an emerging Mike Miller. But injuries ravaged us.

Also franchises that suck don't go on 4 year stretches of averaging 55.5 wins a season. 




 We made the finals a little while ago :(. Not bad for a city with like 12 people in it. 




 Orlando- 3rd richest owner in the league. Proven to be willing to spend that money for his team.

**WE WILL NOT STAY DOWN LONG** 




 That just about exactly how Magic fans felt about Dwight back in '08 




 FBI jobs requiring a JD are hyper competitive. FBI jobs not requiring a JD render law school worthless. 




 I'd like to see it tried. But this sub might be too immature; and the nature of basketball- that it inherently creates more argument- might mean they all turn into shitshows. I can see really posts getting downvotes by team homers, simply because the post is trying to show both sides of the coin.

Also, I think the format should be a little different. Unlike the more random nature of football, it's usually pretty easy to narrow down who the 4-5 contenders are at the beginning of the year and almost always be right. 




 Awwwww Yissssss

Just kidding though. It always sucks to see players decommit. 




 I think a great way to start researching would be [here, on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) 




 "Hey reddit, do this thing for me"

downvote. 




 Why are you posting this here? This has nothing to do with being reformed? Why are you posting this anywhere? I'm sure a quick google search would lead you to YEC websites that attempt to give explanations. 

You are most definitely looking to pick a fight.

Also, just out of curiosity, how old are you?

 I once said CP3 was definitely better than Rondo and ended up at -4. This sub is weird like that. 




 Oh look. Spain with their prissy little acting schtick again. Adding so much to this game. 




 The foul-call rate is too damn high. 




 Ibaka playing? Did Spain's head coach read the Bill Simmons article yesterday? 




 JESSE EISENBERG SIGHTING 




 Sure it can. Lou Williams was a hell of a lot more efficient at scoring and getting to the line than Nick Young is; that's still a downgrade.
