 Thank you very much for the reference to the very interesting blog that you included. It is greatly appreciated. 




 Divine intervention ? 




 There will, of course, be a spike in inflation in terms of imported goods. Despite its own difficulties Russia is likely to offer Greece a deal on energy so that will be a deflationary impulse. On the other hand there is sure to be some stockpiling on the part of the population so that is inflationary. The effect on the tourist industry will likely be deflationary as businesses chase a declining tourist dollar. The ups and downs go on and on. I subscribe to releases from the IMF, but they have so far not hazarded a guess. I suppose there are other forecasts, but I can't refer you to any specifics. 




 Probably. I would never shop in a place like that and neither would most of the people I meet on a day-to-day basis. Its clientele comes from a rather higher socioeconomic level. Still, it's nice to see it in print. 




 Funny ? 




 Actually Zinoviev who put the opposition at a higher number. Also from the realism displaced at both the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks/Communists and Lenin's own statements. You live in a small world where legitimate scholarly work is denigrated as propaganda against an archaic view. 




 No. The fight against IS is likely to be long and drawn out. Given Turkey's recent complicity in the attack on Kobane the open question is when the USA will decide to 'go rat' on the Kurds. In the end the USA values the Turkish alliance infinitely more than any friendship with the Kurds. The USA will probably delay until they are good and certain that IS is defeated. 




 At least no lives were lost in this latest failure. 




 To my knowledge the USA is close to being unique in the world in this regard. Even in France where language purity is along established tradition foreign languages don't evoke anywhere near this sort of hostility. Perhaps Turkey may be comparable in regards to at least Kurdish and Armenian.  




 Yes, I believe that's a correct reading. 




 Never mind. The hierarchy of Mexico recently carried out an exorcism of the whole country because of the 'demonic possession' of having a majority disagree with a certain Church doctrine. 




 Probably true. I'm agnostic about the point. If you define sociopathy as a 'mental illness' the work on prison populations would say otherwise. You can be well assured that there will be an attempt to expand this category to include as many unemployed people as possible. I suspect that there are some conditions defined as 'mental illnesses' either now, in the past or yet to come that would result in a person being **less prone** to violence. These would be of the 'paralyzing kind' that preclude a wide spectrum of action.

The point the spokeswoman for Mental Health Resistance was making is a fairly simple one. People who are **upset** are more likely to become violent, or in this case possibly become the victims of violence. She may have chosen her words poorly, but the context makes it clear what she was saying. 




 I think it will be their income that will be tracked rather than expenses. The experiment has been run before, and a particularly successful trial was in the town of Thompson (I think - memory can be fallible), Manitoba, Canada. If I remember correctly it ran for over a decade. Once more I'll have to check. Get back to you on this. 




 Actually not. The word 'communism' had a meaning long before the birth of post-modernist fashion, and it will have a meaning long after said fashion is consigned to the same archives in which Thomist philosophy, Hegelianism, Christology, positivism and dozens of other 'new and brilliant insights' reside. It means an economic system wherein individuals and families contribute labor in common and take goods from a common stock. In  practice such systems have usually been administered by an authoritarian ruling class and with rather strict sanctions via social convention. The longest lasting example in historical times were the Jesuit Reductions of South America.

This economic system is quite (and obviously) separate from the modern states that have used 'communism' as an ideological justification. Those states are what is more commonly understood as "communist" in everyday speech. The actual original and economic meaning can be better gathered from reading say the Bible than from any Stalinist propaganda. 

Stalinist states have been "communist" in the same sense as the Holy Roman Empire was "Holy" and "Roman". They most certainly deserve to be demonized, and one of the authors you mention, Zizek, makes a very good and persistent effort at exorcising said demon. He did, after all, have the perspective given by having lived under one such class system.

The 'socialism' the author of the article is speaking about is not synonymous with communism. In actual fact pretty well *every* modern society, perhaps *every* society ever, has segments of its economy that are "communist". It couldn't function otherwise. The largest segment of our present economies happens within the bounds of family relations. Communism in the original sense is mostly about distribution. Socialism is about power relations in production.

Nope, I'm not searching for the word "communism" at all, and neither is the author. 




 As the author of the article makes plain **neither** is state capitalism/socialism controlled by a new ruling class embedded in said state. There are problems, of course, with simple economic democracy, and questions about relations with other workplaces and the community have to be worked out. That is a matter of future experimentation. State socialism/capitalism which the author has criticized has had its chance at said experimentation, and it has proven a dismal failure - as would be expected from a system that is obviously a rationale for a new ruling class, obvious to everyone but its believers and especially practitioners. 




 Well, that's quite orthodox. It's actually quite a common opinion amongst left communists. Leninists and Stalinists pay it lip service, but it has never been carried out in practice aside from the economic disaster of 'war communism' in the early years following 1917. That system, of course, depended on simple theft from the peasantry, and it was also very much a class system. It became increasingly so practically by the month. The new ruling class was embodied in the Bolshevik/Communist Party and it incorporated ex-workers and also not a few members of the old Tsarist bureaucracy.

Others may consider that the democratic side of equality ie a *real* abolition of classes or perhaps even the abolition of the *inevitable* outcome of inequality of authority - actual economic inequality in the distribution of goods by whatever system, market *or otherwise* to be more important. Still others may consider the division of society into order givers and order takers to be equally or more important than a simple abolition of the market. Especially as distribution in such a so-called 'communist' economy will, in any foreseeable future require a rationing system - by an 'incredible coincidence' administered by the order givers.

Now I'm not saying that such a 'communist' system is impossible. As a matter of fact one existed for about 150 years - the Jesuit Reductions of South America. In some ways these were quite admirable. They were certainly more humanitarian than the colonial regimes they were independent of and more so than their distant reflection in the Stalinist regimes of the 20th century. They even, aside from religion, preserved native cultures to the best of their ability. The ruling clerical class recruited its cadre from the natives at least as well as Stalinist regimes have done with their lip service to the workers. It must be admitted that the Jesuits were far and away less susceptible to personal corruption than Stalinist regimes have proven to be. Incredibly so !

Within the Reductions the economy was as 'non-commodified' as any idealist Marxist could ever desire. Money was only involved in trade with the outside world. Beyond family plots goods and necessities were allocated according to need - as determined by the ruling clerical class of course. It actually worked, and only ended due to the dissolution of the Jesuit Order by Papal decree. 

Have a look. It's what you want. Be aware that the Society of Jesus accepts novices in our time as well. If the abstract (and idealist) goal of abolishing commodity production is more important than the ~~idealist~~ real desire for equality both in terms of economics and authority then you have a very good model there. Maybe you can begin a campaign for the canonization of a St. Dzhugashvili. 




 True, that's the present consensus. The article is inaccurate in that regard. 




 I don't think the list was set up as a 'one to ten'. In any case note that the list comes from a larger website that presents a wide selection of other progressive Middle Eastern musicians. 




 I seem to recall that you're quite an admirer of Wolff's. Don't worry. You'll get there faster than me a lot of times in the future. 




 Poland is rather unique in the EU. Even Ireland has moved beyond the shadow of clerical power. 




 Look back at the article to see the context. The statement was made by an activist with Mental Health Resistance, a left wing mental health consumers group. You can look up their Facebook page. Now, the context. She noted that people visiting mental health centers often become quite upset, and that is a fact. She mentions the situation of people leaving their appointments in an upset state. Especially in a place where they may be pressured to work for nothing ie workfare. Think about this for a minute. Can fights break out as they pass through groups of other people upset for a different reason and not entirely familiar with the merged purpose of the center. Of course it can. It may not be 'politically correct' to say so, but it is factually correct. The interesting thing is that the aggression may begin from the regular unemployed and not necessarily the mentally ill. That is the only part she omitted.  




 Note that it's part of a larger site featuring progressive middle eastern musicians in general. 




 Maybe it was the source that people are voting for. The BBC (published today) has a lot of fans. 




 Thanks for the information. 




 On vice versa. To define being unemployed as being a mental illness. 




 Yes, except the destruction of soviet democracy occurred very much earlier than the rise of Stalin. There were numerous oppositions within the Bolshevik Party itself against the progressively more hierarchical/dictatorial policies of the government during the first 4 years of the Bolshevik regime. The one that opposed Trotsky's plans to reinstitute the normal hierarchy of a regular army was called the 'Military Opposition'. At the Party Congress of 1919 their resolution against not just 'order givers' but also a class of officers who were to receive special privileges received 95 votes against 174 for the Trotsky/Sokolnikov plan. From this time forward 'recruitment' to the Red Army developed more and more towards conscription (kidnapping to the peasants involved). There were numerous other oppositions formed in the next 2 years, but in 1921 the fate of democracy in both the Bolshevik Party and Russia in general was sealed. The Bolsheviks had come to rule a country where they had defeated their organized opponents but where 90 to 95% of the population opposed them. NEP and the end of War Communism was the concession to this public opinion.

I can recommend a good book on this period of history. See Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. His case is basically airtight. As one article's title read 'Stalin didn't fall from the sky'. 




 The return of ranks in the Red Army, along with the destruction of the authority of the factory committees, then the unions and finally the soviets was *not* a neutral decision taken purely because of  'technical reasons'. It was very much a political decision, and it was opposed, ineffectively unfortunately, through each of its stages. 




 It's been done before in other cities, and yes, by its very nature, it is an experiment. So I agree. 




 A good source for regular environmental news from China is [China Dialogue](http://www.chinadialogue.net) . It is amazingly forthright for a mainland publication and well worth following. 




 The desks are next to each other or down the hall. If you've been observant when attending the offices of the 'helping' bureaucracies you will notice there is an "intake process". Little boxes are being checked indicating whether you will or will not become raw material of the 'production process' of various employees. All bureaucracies are the same. Their everyday work acts to both justify itself and to expand its field of operation whatever that may be. Effectiveness is usually not factored in at all unless some sort of scandal happens. 

For those who so far have escaped the label of 'mentally ill' the intake process by its very existence puts others in a position of deciding whether said label is to be applied or not. If none of the unemployed who don't bear the label didn't fit into the check boxes then the merging of the intake processes would be even more absurd than the usual government bureaucracy. It doesn't just 'insinuate'. It 'demands' that the boxes be checked. 

As to the larger world outside it is already a matter of discussion in some media about the 'character failings' of the unemployed. This merely adds fuel to the fire. 




 In Britain there have been programs that force people to work for various institutions, often NGOs *for no salary whatsoever*. There has been a lot of protest against this 'workfare'. If you were forced into that I don't think you'd be too happy. Similarly the way that 'job centres' work in most countries is that you God-damn better take what is offered/demanded. No begging off. Think about that for awhile.

As to the other unemployed workers who don't carry the label you may consider them 'privileged', and that, of course is your privilege to think as you wish. They, however, don't think it would be a 'privilege' to be so labeled. They, by the way, may be just as "hungry".

Sending the mentally ill to a 'job centre' is **not** so that they can be reassured that employers discriminate against them. It's so they can be forced to accept whatever a 'caring' bureaucracy feels or is told to feel is appropriate. 




 In Britain there was a move to place a mental health clinic in a government job center. Both the mental health workers and their clients protested *because* 1)it implied that unemployment itself was a sign of mental illness, 2)that unemployed people would be pressured to accept the label of 'mental illness' and 3)the mentally ill would be under further pressure to accept whatever job the employment center offered/forced on them. There are other reasons that the article explains. The last part is a sarcastic jibe at what is implied by this government move ie that the unemployed have "something wrong in the head or they wouldn't be unemployed". 

I'm sure that that wouldn't have fitted into the title box. 




 It looks interesting, and the price is not too outrageous. I wonder what shipping is though. Probably more than the book itself. What did you have to pay for shipping ? 




 I see. I guess those are legitimate beefs.  




 What did you dislike about it ? 




 Thanks. It's been a time since I have read anything on the dwarf planets, and Haumea was quite interesting when I looked it up. 




 Isn't it always that way ? 




 The IWW *definitely* wouldn't endorse Sanders or any other political candidate. It's one of their fundamental principles that union action and organization shouldn't be mixed with partisan politics of any sort. 




 My mistake. The proper term is "oblate spheroid". It's flattened at *both* poles, not just the north one.  




 Only "more or less" spherical. Consider Earth's 'pear shape' and its equatorial bulge. 




 Vers le bas avec la dictature des microbes. 




 I think Felis domesticus and Canis familiaris are going to be very upset when they find out there are prior claims to domesticated humans. 




 It's government contracting. In that world if you pay a dollar for a toothpick you haven't looked for the 'best toothpick'. 




 Yes, but the molecular clock has its own problems in terms of choice of gene/protein and therefore calibration. To a large extent people have relied on ribosomal RNA for comparing organisms. 




 I think that's generally true. The fat soluble vitamins (A,D and E) are the ones most susceptible to overdose. There are, however, exceptions to this, and people can be surprisingly creative in finding ways of getting themselves into trouble. 




 That congregation has the most incredible history. Thanks for the post. 




 I believe the article discussed the use of cyanocobalamin (B12) for actual medical conditions and at reasonable doses. It's particularly indicated in a lot of elderly people. 




 Thank you. 




 Thanks. I wonder what the scale in the photograph would be. 




 Yes, that may come to be due market mechanisms. 




 No, it's aliens girls. 




 I think that such plans are discussed quite frequently. One big roadblock I can see is economic viability. It wouldn't be economically feasible to mine iron in this way. Maybe if there were bodies that held significant amounts of 'rare earths' outside of Earth. 




 :) The 'War of the Spots' ? HG Wells returns. 




 I see. That holds water. There is still something, however, that I'd question. Are you perhaps 'begging the question' by initially assuming that one of the propositions *has* to be false ? 




 The dependence of production on a group of consumers wealthy enough to purchase their products has a lot to say for it, and is actually a fundamental belief of most modern economics. Its greatest proof in practice is (was ?) the Keynesian policies that guide modern states' economic policies. Quite frankly I can't answer your question in any certain way. All that I can say is that history has shown that states *can* exist for at least some time with different ways of managing production and distribution other than the controlled market that most of the world operates under today. I don't think that state socialism ala the former Communist countries exhausts all the possibility.

A long time ago I read a book titled 'The Disposal of Surplus Population in Managerial Society'. I've been trying to acquire a copy for some yaers now. Grim ? Yes. 




 Yes, it can be interesting up to the point of fascinating. Trying to figure out who might have written such a thing and why can be a real head-scratcher. I don't think it's a google translate, at least from any language I am familiar with. I'd go with a stream of consciousness free association, penned for a reason I can't comprehend. 




 Oh my God. I wonder what the poetry means if anything. 




 For those interested in following events in China here are a few sources:

1)China Labour Bulletin http://www.clb.org.hk

2)China Dialogue http://www.chinadialogue.net (Environmental news. Based on the mainland but surprisingly open with criticism of official policy)

3)Free China Feminists http://facebook.com/chinesefeminists (Concerning Chinese feminists recently arrested and prosecuted for feminist protests in China) 




 I presume there were crop losses in Ukraine as well. 




 In terms of 'surgeon' it may be further broken down. You note that ordinary doctors and nurses don't score so high on psychopathy. I'd lay bets that orthopedic surgeons top the list.  




 A little while ago I read an article saying that the constraints on physical constants in other universes may not be so strict in terms of ruling out life as some have thought. Damned if I can remember the article's title, but I'll try and find it. 




 Interesting. I'm sure the Fermi paradox has lots of holes in it, and you have pointed that out. Time travel, however, seems to have such a paradox in it via the old "kill your grandparents" story. What do you think of that thought experiment ? 




 He'll come running at top speed. 




 You are right. There has been a lot of international discussion on the subject but so far no really firm plans. 




 OK. You brightened my day. 




 Thanks. 




 And their own benefit as well. 




 Yes, that's a very important part of the report, and it is something to note. 




 Short, sweet and to the point. :) 




 Thanks for the link. 




 Both points are valid even though it comes to my mind that wind power is actually quite an ancient technology. Even so a little good news is better than none. 




 In the morning light I see what you mean. 




 Indeed. Looking over the offending sentence I'd say that it would have to be totally rewritten. It's beyond simple word substitution. 




 That would be an extremely good idea economically, but it's impossible politically. 




 How so ? I have to confess that the first thing that comes to my mind is that if China is a "communist-capitalist" apocalypse then Canada must be a "capitalist-communist" one. Sorry. It's late at night. 




 Sit back in your chair. It's time for a lecture here. Are you ready ? Steven Pinker is *Jewish*. Let me repeat that. Steven Pinker is *Jewish*. He was born to parents in the Jewish community of Montral. You can easily verify this by any biography about him. The only way he is not Jewish is the same way I am not Catholic. He says he became an atheist at the age of 13. I didn't do that until I was 15, but I guess Pinker is just smarter than me. He remained and perhaps still remains very much a 'cultural Jew'.

Here's the lecture part. A lot of people who are on what passes for a 'left' in the USA immediately reach for a political correctness clich in lieu of having any sensible arguments. I have seen that a lot of the 'cultural studies' left in the USA have been told to hate people like Pinker because there is a popular (in restricted circles) belief that his views are somehow, in a rather mystical way actually, supporting the social structures they oppose.

Now I don't know your views on Pinker's scientific work, but if you are of the 'cultural studies left' I hope you keep this incident in mind. PC clichs are not arguments. In fact they are very much neurotoxic. They destroy the brain cells that American leftists very much need if they are ever going to build an effective left in the USA. If you are not in the PC left ballpark then this is merely a bit of correction. Wanna hear some 'Catholic stereotypes' ? 




 Yes. The authors had a poor choice of words there. 




 Looks like an incredibly comprehensive list. I wasn't aware that Christie had been keeping up his film projects since the end of his TV channel. 




 You might say that he is now no longer "fashionable". 




 I'm fairly confident that there'd be something comparable for amphibians considering all the press they've received over the past few decades. The [International Union for Conservation of Nature](http://www.iucn.org) maintains what they call a 'Red List' of species at risk. It includes plants and a few fungi, but it mostly concentrates on animals. I don't know if this will be of any use, but have a look. 




 Well yes there are socioeconomic factors that make certain people in India particularly vulnerable. That's a given in any system that is highly unequal. These sorts of problems are not unique to India. I recently read an analysis of the heat wave deaths during one episode in *France* a few years ago. The inequality in India just happens to be particularly glaring. It's something like the effects of an earthquake. Think Nepal recently or the comparison between earthquakes in Chile and Haiti a few years ago. Socioeconomic factors and poor planning certainly contributed to the death and damage toll, but the immediate cause *was* an earthquake. The factors that make a society vulnerable always have to be kept in mind, but they don't abolish other causes.

 




 Apparently so, but I'm not really up to date on that. 




 My God. It seems that my ass is capable of at least kindergarten reasoning in pointing out the obvious. That's one smart ass. 




 Yep. You are the second person who noticed this. Of the 4 'rocky planets' only Earth is *known* to harbor life. Mercury and Venus definitely do not. Mars is still an open question, and only time will tell. I can remember two times of 'great excitement' about that. One was a report of 'organic structures' in a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica. The second was the first chemistry reports from one of the landers finding supposed metabolism from a Martian soil sample. Both failed to hold up on further scrutiny. The question is however still open as you note. 




 Yes, governments can be inconsistent.  




 Yes. The latest news is that he has been fired. You might say that the spin doctors performed an amputation. Given the pictures of him I've seen I suspect he will soon have to settle for a lesser degree of sartorial display. 




 The usual sources say 97 to 98 **or more** given uncertainty. The "or more" is always there. Here's a couple of the usual sources - [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus). NASA also lists the 18 American scientific societies and 200 international societies that publically endorse the anthropogenic causation of global warming. The [Skeptical Science](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm) site also has a goodly number of links. They quote a figure of "97 to 98 % **or more**'" even though their survey of published peer reviewed papers **couldn't find one single paper dissenting from the consensus in the period of 1993 to 2003**. In science there is always an allowance for error.

A better and more comprehensive survey was carried out by geochemist [James Lawrence Powell](http://www.jamespowell.org). In a survey of 13,950 papers from 1991 to 2012 he found 24 that deviated from the consensus. This is a consensus of **99.83%**. Things progress. In his survey of 10,883 papers published in 2013 (he expanded his search) he found **2** that dissented from the consensus. This is a consensus rate of **99.987%**.

The consensus is pretty well universal and has been so for many years. What amazes me is the level of hostility and anger displayed by many of the deniers. You'd think all these scientists, their societies, worldwide government agencies and other international bodies were involved in a gigantic conspiracy to murder their beloved grandmother.   




 Indeed. But Mars is far enough out that the craft doesn't get (solar)winded. 




 That's true. The crucial thing about greenhouse gases is that their effects are *automatically* world wide. India's incredible pollution problems are a separate subject from climate change. At the same time I sure wouldn't pick Delhi as my favourite place to live. 




 Finally, real irony. Thanks. it lightens the mood. 




 El Nios and La Ninas are not a matter of one year on and one off. The present El Nio is still developing. The future does not cause the present. 




 Two points that you try to dodge with sarcasm:

1)The big one is that the El Nio you are trying to blame isn't fully developed yet.

2)The main financial interest in this debate lies with the fossil fuel industry. As to any conflict of interest amongst the 97% or 99% of reputable scientists who can recognize reality I doubt if their total salaries equal 10 million, let alone 100 billion. I gather the 100 billion sum includes every manufacturer of any renewable energy plant in the whole world. The conspiracy thickens.

As to your rhetoric it is as childish as that of a **very** small number amongst the the billions of people who can recognize a reality that triggers an emotional reaction in you.

Please check your great hero and victim hat at the door when you leave the room. The only "camp" you need is a summer camp that teaches manners. 




 I guess that 99% of the world's scientists, climatologists, geologists, meteorologists, etc. are *on the take* along with the scientific societies and the countries and international organizations that they work for. Conversely the small number of climate change deniers hired by the fossil fuel industry are obviously the very soul of objectivity.

Now, to speak to the specific question of drought in India. The **yet to fully develop** El Nio may have something to do with the temperatures and drought if one holds that the future can determine the present. Even if El Nio *was* fully developed you should consider the analogy of the eight ounce glass. Call El Nio two ounces to be poured in. Without climate change the glass holds 5 ounces. Pour in El Nio and the glass holds the full amount. If, however, with climate change the glass has 7 ounces there's a big mess when you pour in the 2 ounces of El Nio.

Every single weather event always has a number of contributing factors -always. You cannot 'prove', however, that one factor doesn't count just by noting that there are others working as well especially if the others are yet to come. 




 I wonder how long it will take for him to want to sell the suit *cheap*. I'm in the market whenever it happens. 




 That's good to hear if true. If it is I'm sure he can get a job come Christmas time playing Scrooge in Christmas pageants. 

I just had a look at the photo in your link. Looks like he'll have to adjust to a bit lower sartorial style in the future.  




 Yes, I keep seeing news stories about this. The air pollution in Delhi seems to be especially frequent. 




 One other thing about the exec in question. He should 'definitely' be spoken to about him and alcohol. I liked the pun by the way. Good one. 




 Yes, very culty and also absurd. It does an incredible amount of damage. Even if it is pretty obvious that it is 99.999% pure bullshit and chest beating it can take on an air of so-called 'reality' to people unacquainted with the level of illusion on the internet. It serves a few other functions as well. One is that it is incredibly useful for information gathering on the part of domestic spy agencies. Every fool who mindlessly shouts out their approval for a silly piece of bragging is automatically added to a surveillance list. What is more all people in contact with them are correlated as well. Gotta keep those lists up to date. 

Another thing is that such foolish diarrhea of the mouth is actually 'evidence for the prosecution' in future trials. This simple common sense fact is beyond the imagination of those whose idea of 'politics' is an opportunity to get their aggression out in a forum where they have an illusion of anonymity. 

There are other practical considerations as well, and behind them all lurks a cosmic sized fact. Nothing can be accomplished with childish displays of identity and hostility. It leads nowhere. Actually creating something requires totally different thought and action. Slow and steady reaches the destination. 




 Welcome. I had a quick look at your subreddit and subscribed. I see you're just starting out, but I hope you'll grow. My own tastes run towards reports of actual actions and especially organization that is making a concrete difference in the real world. I notice some articles of that type in your sub. The one about Masai women and solar power stood out in my mind. Feel free to crosspost here especially stories of that type. Do use "cross post from r/worldfeminism" in brackets. Take care. 




 Very good.  




 You're welcome. 




 I don't think that the J. Crew crew were *not* upset. The reason *why* they were and what they intend to do about it, however, are an entirely different matter.  




 The 'problem' could be stated this way: terrorist attacks motivated by right wing views were at least an order of magnitude more frequent than those coming from the left or from Islamists *before 9-11*. After 9-11 this remains the same. If the 9-11 policies were aimed at preventing the most common terrorist attacks then they are an obvious failure. 

Another thing to take into account in relation to 9-11 is to look at like it was a football series. One team wearing black hats got lucky *once* and won big. May I suggest that it wasn't and isn't that the guys in the white hats are so good but rather that the other side is so bad. All this is, of course, concerning Islamist terrorist attacks *inside the USA*. *Outside* the USA Islamist terrorism chugs merrily along, and no reduction can be seen. The victims of this are overwhelmingly other Muslims. If 9-11 had been prevented (as similar plots were in France) the 'top dog' of terrorist atrocities in the USA would have been the Oklahoma City bombing.

No I don't think 9-11 policies have been effective at all, but that was only *one* of the reasons they were brought into being. 




 That's undoubtedly the sad truth. 




 It should be noted that the list was last updated in 2005. A good number of the items listed no longer exist. I'm afraid that there is no more current listing that I know of. 




 I have a hard time understanding your points. Your first paragraph seems to be saying that I am advocating voting for Sanders which I am not. I wasn't advocating any such thing. I was describing a process that inevitably eats away at the hopes of any 'left-winger' who thinks they can push a slightly left-wing party further to the left by faction fighting within the party. These sorts of attempts are *far* more serious and sustained than a campaign around a particular candidate for leader, incredibly *far* more. This experience within a political party is actually far more 'democratic' than the 'football game fandom' of cheering on an individual leader whether in contests for leadership or in an actual election. They are to 'democracy' in the same way as a sustained series of any sort of events is to a 30 second blurb on the television.

Now I may have misread your intentions. I assumed that you were some sort of 'left-Democrat' who wished their party to be more connected to ordinary people and blamed the disconnect on a cabal of unsavoury manipulators within the party, blaming the personalities of the manipulators rather than the actual party structures that give them their power. 

I am most certainly *not* saying "democracy fails". In the case of a federal party in the USA nobody could say that with certainty because said parties have never been "democratic" (small d) to begin with. I *am* saying that there are other ways of political action that are much more worthy of the name "democracy".

As to your second paragraph saying that the movement is "towards money" is nothing more than saying "rightward" in different words. Moving "towards money" is nothing more than a gradual accommodation with possessors of power outside of the political game. 

American politics were not always as empty as they are today. Before they degenerated into the 'fandom' they are today there were *serious* parties contending for power such as the Populists, the Farmer-Labor Alliance and even the American Socialist Party. I leave the sectarian left out of this for good reason. Even today we have the American Green parties where the process of accommodation plays out as it does in social democratic and green parties elsewhere in the world.

So, hardly a "load of crap" unless you wish to maintain the illusion that dominates American politics today that personality is all that matters and that all that is required is that the 'good guys' get in and the 'bad guys' are removed. 




 My first thought is that if such a thing were possible it would still be ongoing. There is no evidence of such creation of matter in any of the black holes studied to date. 




 Once a political party becomes an established organization it develops certain 'levers of power' that are often (almost always) not explicitly stated and may in fact be invisible to 'outsiders'. The Democratic Party is no exception. Rather than discuss its complexes of influence let's take the case of pretty well *every* social democratic party in the whole world, from the Canadian NDP, to British and Australian Labour, to the French Socialist Party, to the SPD, to Greece's PASOK and so on and so forth. **All** of these parties began with a much clearer conception of socialism and an idea of fighting for the lower classes than the Democrats ever had. There was less compromise or collaboration if you will to begin with. In every last one of these cases the parties moved rightwards, especially rapidly if they gained power. In *all* these cases there were movements within the parties to 'reform' or 'return the party to its roots'. They *all* failed. *All* of these parties could be said to have much healthier 'roots' than the Democrats ever had.

It's an inevitable progression. The bureaucrats *always* outmaneuver the 'idealists', and if the idealistic reformer can't be ditched they are either marginalized or the 'Roman Solution' is applied ie "buy the barbarians off". It's a sad but inevitable process. 




 Possibly. Human politics versus baboon politics = We don't always follow the brightest ass. 




 Are there any online links ? 




 Yes that's true. My first thought is that the 'cores' that lead to active geology on such bodies aren't ionized like Earth's core. Or maybe it isn't cores at all but rather due to an equivalent to Earth's mantle. Or maybe the magnetic field of a moon is swamped by the much stronger one of a giant planet. Very puzzling in any case. 




 There has been a lot of violence, perpetrated by *both* sides in this long simmering dispute. The trouble is that the Chinese government can't see how acts of repression, sometimes quite petty, have exactly the opposite effect than the one they want. Petty repression will lead to *more* terrorism, not less. 




 Yes, the decree has its absurd implications. 




 Thank you. That was a wonderful essay. It explains a lot. 




 I think mining on Venus is still quite a distant project. 




 Apparently Venus has no magnetic field which certainly seems contradictory to its having active geology. There's a lot of mystery here. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 I think we're in good company. Black holes are an endless source of theories so I guess it's safe to say that nobody can claim a complete understanding. At one point the big question was whether they existed or not. When relativity and quantum mechanics are properly integrated then I'm sure things will be much clearer. 




 I'm afraid I am not capable of answering the question. You probably know more about the process than I do. I guess the best way is to have a look at actual holograms and the technology to produce them and then moving up from there. 




 I'm afraid that I can't explain it myself. I have read articles about the entire universe already being a hologram. It is moving so I presume one on the surface of a black hole would do likewise. 




 Yeah I know. My usual practice when I think a noun or an adjective are anything but their usual denotation is to put commas or quotation marks around the item in question. Sometimes I put a clarification within brackets after the item in question. I'm pretty sure, given the general orientation of the Guardian, that is merely a fault in writing style.  




 People can be strange quite often. From the way the author describes the hate mail it seems to be mostly coming from 'the left', or what passes for such. I can see how it could come from some segments of the anti-science right, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

The author says that the haters are angry that the money supposedly devoted to her 'de-extinctioning' could be better spent on other conservation projects instead. She points out that there is *no* active ongoing research on reviving extinct species in her lab, but people will hear what they want to hear. 

There are also anti-science beliefs common to the 'right' (think evolution, climate change and general environmentalism), and they are actually far more common than the anti-science of the 'left'. From my reading her angry critics are probably far more 'leftist' environmentalism.

There is, of course, the fact that some people can't seem to speak about anything at all without getting angry and offensive. With the internet such people have the whole world as their playground. 




 I believe the author was speaking ironically. It is, after all, from The Guardian, a paper not noted for its subservience to corporate designs. I agree the irony could have been better conveyed. 




 Well, I can only hope that there is enough noise about it that the State feels it expedient to take it down, even if only temporarily. 




 Yep. When they die they'll all be beatified immediately, and within two years it's canonization/sainthood for them all. The necessary miracle ? Well the whole world economy didn't circle the drain no matter what they did. 




 :) They'd also burn up from the inside out because they have a lump of coal where a heart should be. 




 Well I guess so. One thing argues against this though. I have it on good authority that there are no tax collectors on Venus. 




 The question is whether Venus is 'geologically dead' like Mars, the Moon or Mercury or active like the Earth. Surface temperature under a runaway greenhouse effect doesn't necessarily mean an active core or volcanos. 




 Whether it is the "only" one is arguable . Argentina went through a sovereign default in 2001 as did Russia in 1998. It could be argued that Russia and Argentina are not "developed" countries, but it is a grey area. 




 I realize that, but the usual use of a colon in print is for a subtitle. On the internet people will sometimes use it to add their own expansion to a title. If you use it to mock or disagree with either the title or the content of an article it is best to add some sort of 'irony mark'. In the text of an article in both print and internet this is usually done by bracketing the part you feel is bad by commas. In the title substitution you use it would have perhaps been a bit clearer if you had put a question mark behind the title or added some other indicator of irony. 




 I don't know. Loss of bathroom privileges perhaps ? 




 Optimism about immunotherapy has come and gone before. The difference today is that we are seeing it in the context of much greater basic knowledge. 




 You should have stuck with the article's original title. The title above leaves an impression that you are advocating for the bill. I know you aren't, but a quick glance would imply that you were. 




 There's a Japanese term for death by overwork, "karoshi".  




 Double thanks here. One is that you jolted my conscience awake, and reminded me that I should really get around to finishing part 4 of the translation. Another thanks for jolting my memory about your Bakunin library project. Very interesting.

Interesting article by the way. The old 'name dilemma' happens to almost every anarchist who has been active for long periods of time. At some point the disgust with some of the anti-social trends the movement attracts begins to gnaw. Trying to correct public misconceptions about the meaning of the word becomes even more difficult when there are 'comrades' who are overjoyed at promoting the worst labels imaginable and all the labels imply.

'Libertarian socialism' is the most common euphemism, and one I have often used. 'Libertarian communism' in its Spanish or French renderings is probably the most common. Prefixes such as "social" are probably the most popular in English. Implying, of course, that there is such a thing as "anti-social" anarchism which is unfortunately true. 




 I think your criticisms carry some weight. I'm going to have another look at the survey to see if I can find the exact form of the question. I follow Gallup and Pew, both of whom are fairly reputable, but I know there can be problems even with them. When I think about it there is yet another category to add to your list. I call them the "vagues". They pick this from one religion and that from another but basically don't take any of their "beliefs" too seriously. There's a lot of them. 




 Well it may be a bit off topic, but I think you might find the history of the Jesuit 'Reductions' in South America of interest. It is sometimes referred to by Latin Americans but rarely looked at in North America. These were 'colonies' of native people, centred on Paraguay but also in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, run by the Jesuit Order and independent of the colonial authorities. Their economy was basically communistic with a small sector involved in individual production. They raised their on militia which was usually used to fight off slaver parties from the Portuguese colony in Brazil, but were sometimes called on to fight in other campaigns.

The 'reductions' certainly shouldn't be idealized. They were totalitarian far beyond modern examples such as Nazism or Stalinism. Everyday life was drastically regimented. The very highest authorities were also, of course, members of the Jesuits, but other officials were freely chosen from amongst the local people. What can be said of the Jesuits ho ran them - they were *far and away* more committed to a voluntary poverty that equalized their conditions with those they ruled than any modern ruling class has been. It's amazing what the fear of God can do.

Have a look. Modern liberation theology is not a direct descendant, but these experiments have at least an indirect effect today. 




 Looks like this is going to be a bit of a contest. Mammal (me) versus reptile. As with many **dozens** of other posts the one above was lifted probably via a bot from r/worldanarchism without either permission nor proper attribution.  




 As has happened **many** dozens of times the post above was acquitted from r/worldanarchism **without either permission nor proper attribution**. 




 ONCE MORE - The post above is a bot acquired copy from one posted * 9 minutes before this* in r/worldanarchism. It is, as usual, like many *dozens* of other examples reposted with neither permission nor attribution.  




 The above post, like many others, was copied from r/worldanarchism without permission or proper attribution.

 Maybe not from simple warnings, but there are other factors in play. 




 Its goal is to set a world's record every month. 




 The report is almost certainly true. The record says that totalitarian regimes often (though not always) attempt to cover up natural disasters. As for NK their policies have *never* worked, and I don't think their present failure is any more dramatic than at any other time. 




 OK, this has gone beyond ridiculous. There are no less than **nine** items posted on this single page which were originally posted at r/worldanarchism. They have been reposted here **word for word** except for the attribution to r/worldanarchism. It seems you have a bot that scans that subreddit and reposts things here. The time between the original posting has varied from a high of 1:49 hours to a low of **21 seconds**. Over the past months this has happened repeatedly, to the tune of **dozens** of items. I have already requested that you attribute your source if you wish to continue this practice, but there was no response on your part.

Now...you are totally free to do this with others items that I may post in different subreddits. In such cases I don't give a shit. The r/worldanarchism subreddit, however, is one that I wish to promote, and I do not appreciate what you are doing. I have little doubt that my case isn't the only one in which you engage in this behavior.

So... when I return to this tomorrow I hope to see that you have properly added your source in all nine posts that are presently visible on this page. You can leave the dozens of others alone. I would also hope that you will not behave in this way in the future.

 




 I have no idea why this, of all items, should be downvoted. It seems to me that 'Breaking the Silence' is a quite credible and admirable organization. The report stays on basic humanitarian territory, and I find it hard to imagine how anyone except a true believer in the eternal rightness of the Israeli government could object to it. 




 Actually the title of the article is misleading (but who am I to correct 'Nature' magazine). I was pretty nonplussed myself when I first saw it. The trick is that the treatment isn't really a vaccine at all. Mycobacterial preparations are non-specific immuno-stimulants. One of the earliest to be developed was BCG (Calmette-Guerin bacterium - an attenuated organism used in TB vaccines). There are numerous others, and some are in use for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.

The idea is that non-specific immune stimulation makes the organism less susceptible to inflammation  provoked by stress such as ptsd. Here's where the mystery comes for me. This increased potency must be directed at either aborting a response to pro-inflammatory molecules or in preventing the production of said molecules. I am puzzled by the 'hows' of this. I suspect the microbiome is somehow involved. 




 One problem I notice that the article doesn't discuss is the likelihood of colonization of Nicaragua's rivers and lakes by invasive species. This is not so much invasion from the oceans as species that travel along with the ships.  




 Thanks. I'll try to have a look at that. 




 Well I'll be damned. Thanks. 




 Thanks. I wasn't aware of that review. How far did it progress ? 




 That's a thought. 




 Actually he was a quite efficient bank robber. As to some other matters in his early career you wouldn't be aware of the debate about whether he was an Okhrana (Tsarist secret police) agent or not unless you were a student of Russian history. My opinion, for what it is worth, is "no", but I believe he did betray political rivals, both outside the Bolsheviks and inside, to the police for his own benefit. It's just an opinion, not a demonstrated fact. 




 Nope. It clicks through quite easily. There's something strange happening in the background here as per both your complaint and a strange notification from a bot. 




 Who was the other guy ? It skips my mind for the moment. Now I remember - Harpo, my favourite. This little exchange has the potential to equal the nonsense I see over at many 'anarchist' boards on Reddit. I **DON'T** include you in my 'silly list'. It is always good to be reminded that all the idiots and fools are not necessarily 'on my side'. 




 I guess so, but I am in a different position than you, being as I am much older and our social circles are probably totally different. Enough time on the internet has taught me the vague way that 'fedora' is used as an insult. The problem is that I rarely meet someone dressed up in such an uniform. As to 'Mountain Dew' I am totally at sea with that. Is this some sort of fad or is it yet another insult that is theoretically directed towards environmentalists.  




 You are living in a dream world. Nobody is pushing *anything* "down your throat" by voicing an opinion different from yours.  




 I guess I'm safe on at least some of this matter because I am personally not a believer in nor an 'advocate' of *revolution*. So that particular question is outside my own field of 'worry'. The point I was trying to make is that the date of the source you cited (1898) was a mere three years after the founding of the French CGT. Whatever one may say about anarchosyndicalism, pro or con, it has to be admitted that it was **THE** most popular and effective attempt at bringing the vague and often highly rhetorical ideas of anarchism into the world of actual effective action. 

Many anarchists argued against it or, like Malatesta, pointed out its limitations. As for M. it should be noted that in his final years he was perhaps just as much a gradualist as I am, and he certainly had abandoned the myth of the 'anarchist revolution'. To my mind anarchism is not like paleontology. Its history has to be useful rather than 'stamp collecting', and I think the debates at the turn of the 20th century have a lot to teach us today. It is indeed possible that Nettlau, as a very skilled historian, has a lot to say about the so-called 'revolution, and I am very happy to read the links you provided.

As for my own 'position' when pressed I call myself a 'mutualist', but that's only *when pressed*. I certainly don't agree with a lot of American mutualism. An example would be that I don't think the 'labor theory of value' is either true or useful. Neither do I think that the 'market' is anywhere near as magical as they do. My own mutualism harks back to the original French version with its emphasis on cooperatives, its gradualist approach and, yes, its belief in the efficacy of industrial combination ie syndicalism. This doesn't mean neglecting the communitarian aspects of anarchism, merely putting them in their proper place. That 'place' can't be determined by theory but only by practice.

Perhaps we agree on more than we can imagine though it seems that I am more "anti-revolution" than you. In any case I am in full battle mode now with a strange collection of 'Canadian internet conservative warriors' so I have to get back to that. Strange stuff. They sort of remind me of the cult that runs r/metanarchism. Change the names of the demons and you couldn't tell the difference, aside from the fact that there have been no threats yet. I'm sure it's coming. 




 I don't think here. I've met the CPC internet brigade before, and they are usually a cut above what I see happening here. I like the free advertising by the way. 




 Actually not. There are Marxists and there are Marxists, but I can't say that I resemble any of their schools. I'm afraid I don't feel up to trying (desperately) to educate you on all the various points of Marxism with which I disagree pretty well down the line. There are online resources where you can educate yourself, though I doubt you'll take the opportunity. 




 " Please remember, do not drink and text" - This has been a public service message from MADE, Mothers Against Drunk Email.  




 That is one strange bot. 




 The (mis)use is similar. Even though right wing forces often use 'junk science' or simply ignore science I don't think it has reached the level of Stalin's USSR. Yet... 




 "Trotskiest goose steppers" ?? That's a new one on me. I love replies like this. Whatever I may or may not know about science, even though I am not a "Trotskiest" I know something about the English language. The proper spelling would be "Trotsky*ist*". If you were one of their Stalin*ist* enemies it would be "Trotsky*ite*. As to the "goose-step" part personally I favor the "Bluebird Boogie", but to each their own. If I were doomed to "goose-step" I'd demand it be a "Canada goose-step".  




 Yes, I mentioned Nemesis in reply to another commentator. From what I remember the 'Nemesis Hypothesis' says that said 'intruder' returns at regular intervals. That being said the two theories are similar. 




 I'm not that familiar with her, but what I do know says that she is quite the reliable mouthpiece. 




 People have been working on it for some time, and here's an interesting fact. It's well known that the Canadian federal government has literally thousands of people employed to keep tabs on social media. Guess where these supposed 'ordinary citizens' defend their employer's plans. 




 It sort of reminds me of the 'Nemesis' hypothesis. 




 The term used in science literature is 'translational'. It is somewhere between basic and applied research. Many great programs are not readying research for the market but rather for other social needs. 




 Philae sends a high five from way out there. 




 Sounds like you're already very much on the trail of my impression. Once more I merely skimmed your last reference, but it seems to me that Nettlau was very pessimistic about the future of anarchism in the article you cited. I can see the guy's point. What I will say, however, is that the author wrote his essay at *precisely* the time that anarchosyndicalism was being formalized in France, giving a clear and definite alternative to the loony-bin politics of 'propaganda by the deed' which had poisoned anarchism for almost two decades.

Once more it's on the reading list. 




 I had never heard of him before today so I went and looked him up. It seems that he is mostly active in terms of campaigning against intellectual property. That's fine and good, and I'd probably agree with most of his points. What I *didn't* find, however, was any indication of his views being connected to socialism of any sort nor any indication that whatever money he has collected has gone towards the building of any political network even in terms of his own concerns. Perhaps you can enlighten me as to his relevance to the subject at hand. 




 The reconstruction of dinosaur biophysics is a great field. I'm sorry that I haven't been following it as well as it deserves. 




 Though mercifully less so than the USA. At least in Canada it is pretty well 'snuck in' rather than loudly trumpeted as in the USA. 




 Indeed, and perhaps there are research proposals contained in your question.  




 It's a big step from bacteria to mammals. Myself, I don't know. 




 it seems to me that any such choice would be totally subjective, but I can see what you mean. Without a visible set point longitude is totally meaningless. Basically I don't know how. 




 Actually I realized that after I wrote the comment above, and it's true. If say I'd like the money to spend every last day of the rest of my life pissed to the gills until I finally expire with cirrhosis of the liver I wouldn't get very far with a kickstarter that told the truth. If, however, I were to raise money to supposedly feed hungry children I could merrily use all that money for alcohol (or, as actually happens, printing Bibles and demanding the kids recite verses before they got their soup).  So, true, point granted.

I do, however, stand by the statement that there is *no* 'after the day' plan to do anything when the 100% predictable loss happens. There is a big difference between throwing money at TV ads and actually having a remainder of active social democrat *activists* who will be about their business the Monday after the Friday Convention where Sanders will go over and shake Clinton's paw. Hopefully they won't hug and cheek kiss. As to the 'staying power' of whatever propaganda the Sanders campaign may kick out consider the following. How many of the tens of thousands of ads that a person is exposed to in the course of a year can be remembered a year afterwards ?

Please understand that despite my own anarchist viewpoint I don't have any great animosity towards social democrats. I'd like to see more of them. But... I also know one hell of a lot more about how such parties operate, having once been a member myself many decades ago. At some point I'd like there to be a viable social democratic party in the USA that was worth talking to, influencing and/or negotiating with in a truly cynical mindset/manner. The circus of a Presidential campaign with no planned follow-up does nothing to build such a party. 




 Think about the "wider narrative strategy" that you mention. Where on God's green Earth is it being hidden ? What might it be. After the inevitable happens and he loses the nomination what further plans have been are being or will be made to take advantage of the publicity generated ? I realize what might be done depends very much on how badly he loses, and I personally can't predict that. 

That, I'm afraid is the eternal problem with populist campaigns, of *both* the left and right, in American politics. Organizational alternatives are *never* put forward beyond vague feel-good statements. Here are a few names: Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Ralph Nader and every single Green Party candidate ever nominated. They all shared the same defect as Sanders' does. After the defeat all the supporters wandered off and were never asked to do anything beyond send more money. That is what will happen here as well.

Will his candidacy "force Hillary to the left" ? On a few days it will seem so as Clinton makes left wing noises to certain audiences. But then she will travel on to make different noises to different audiences. I'm sure that Clinton is a shrewd enough politician to know better than to *ever* make a substantive proposal when fine sounding rhetoric will do.

As Sanders' campaign progresses keep track of the money it has raised. As the total gets larger and larger start thinking about what else could have been done with that money. 

   




 Perhaps they will. It depends. Total capitulation would involve ending the occupation for a vague promise of a space sometime in the future. Partial capitulation would be accepting an offered space that was unsuitable for one or many reasons. From what I read here the occupiers seem fully aware of the 'trap' that negotiating with social democrats (the new Madrid administration) can become. 




 This looks like an interesting book. Thanks for posting. I haven't had time to read it all, but a quick scan through reminds me every much of Rocker's [Nationalism and Culture](http://libcom.org/library/nationalism-culture-rudolf-rocker). The date of publication of the latter was 1937. Nettlau's book dates from 1927. Seems Nettlau was perhaps an influence on Rocker. 




 Yes there are indeed problems with the Mondragon model, and their role as an employer which you point out is, in my opinion, the greatest one. 




 Thanks. The lists in that article are fascinating. 




 No, it's not frequent, but there have been other cases. 




 The point that struck me is that this is merely one of many such incidents. 




 That seems like a reasonable hypothesis to me. 




 Well, it's very much the same as a situation where you would want to stop a shipment of something from New York to Illinois. If you'd like to stop that you have opportunities at the borders of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. That's what they are doing. To get from point a to point f you have to pass through points b, c, d and e.
