 It's best if you download more RAM first 




 A HOUR!? 




 Welcome to the big dick club. 




 Just download more RAM, np. 




 i would love the cursor to be a cross hair like attack click, just let us choose from a selection of cursors rito 




 FUCK. 




 I wish i was as cool as you :/ 




 just the new one is plugged into my motherboard, the other 2 are hooked up to my PSU 




 I recently bought a new 140mm fan for my PC to replace the old noisey one. The one i removed was one that simply connects to my PSU, the one i installed has a 4 pin pwm connector that i plugged into my motherboard.

Installation was simple enough, booted up my pc and the fan i had just install was spinning pretty slow. So i opened my PC up again, unplugged it, vacantly gawped at it and as im not a hardware kinda guy just plugged it back in assuming it was just some weird one off issue.

and BOOM the new fan started running much faster, was definately shifting some air about, however now a different fan, an old 120mm fan was now rotating much slower when before it would move some serious air just fine.

So what's the issue here because ive searched online and found nothing, is it a problem with my PSU?? 




 Thank you, kind sir :) 




 ive never understood it :( ELI5? 




 Azoh the legendary Zed main said he really liked my name and wished he had it (A to Zed) made me all warm and fuzzy inside. 




 just look at the public chat rooms on the clients, there are thousands of people advertising elo boosting :/ 




 I THINK EVERYONE IN ALLIANCE AND DIGNITAS IS REALLY AWESOME AND COOL 




 I can picture every person ive ever met smiling, Even if ive only met them briefly or have never seen them smile. 




 I'm worried for my baby :( 




 I played all the champs and settled with Zed. 




 ok, thank you :)
