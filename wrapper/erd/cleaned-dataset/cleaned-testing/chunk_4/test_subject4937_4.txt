 The paint likely wears off. 




 Booked like the rest of you but will certainly give it a shot.  









 They can add it to my list. 




 Cool, thanks for the pointer 









 I wouldn't call it an egg. I'd call it a run of the mill, porous sedimentary rock that is easily stained by iron from other rocks (and yes, possibly rust/iron/impurities in the water). But it's likely not coming from the inside of the rock. And again, it's not an egg. 




 I got mine at Cabella's--they are for fishermen and yes indeed, these are certainly something you want to try on before you buy. They're not cheap but they'll last a lifetime.  




 The handiwork of iron... 














 Cherokee National Forest area is a great place for finding things. Sometimes you can get permission from local land owners (pay them $20) to let you roam their lands. People have huge parcels out that direction and always need some cash. I bring the dog and off I go. 




 Glad to upload some when I'm home again in a week or so :) 




 I realized as soon as I hit enter that yes, of course it's metal...ha. Not plastic, not glass (certainly)... 




 Cool find--the antiques sub has a lot of specialists in certain areas, that might be a good place to ask. Is the lid metal or what tripped your detector? Not the glass itself, right? 



















 *rubs hands* -- thanks for this...will explore this evening 









 I marvel at your incredible fortune at finding this bag... Can you provide some closer shots of glass vial stones. Not sure they are diamond but would like to see closer. Where were these collected? You probably have no idea/backstory, do you? 




 My bucket list just got a little heavier... 




 North Carolina is known for its precious stones. Emeralds in particular. Also an abundance (relatively, of course) of garnet (almandine for the most part); Hiddenite (only found here); ruby/sapphire (lots but not a lot gem quality). My favorite finds in NC are amazing quartzes, some of which are clear as glass and as large as my hand. Most of these found in Western NC.  




 Or resin...quite honestly in the right casing, it looks like stone. Can you scratch it off with a needle? 









 That's what a call a flower vase with a backstory ;) 




 I live nowhere near WA but just spent a solid 30 minutes learning...very informative site. I wish all states would have such a by mineral/by location resource. 




 So what are they then? Can you share once you've paid your people off so people can learn? That's why a lot of us are part of a sub like this, after all. 




 Thane of Cawdor! 









 Well, that was a very pleasant virtual walk in the morning. Lovely. 




 Ah--you answered my other questions in one neat sentence there--who is it aimed at. Do you have a site with more details? 




 What kind of performance drag is expected for the complex simulations? 




 Ah...fond memories of playing CyberMorph just came flooding back. With awful memories of the dentist. I am conflicted. 




 This would be the equivalent of collecting everyone's used (loser) scratch-off lottery tickets in a pile and double-checking them to see if there are any people who decided going back to the store for their $2 winning wasn't worth the effort.  




 I am waiting for someone to say "slag" ... 




 Any and all tourmalines, hands down 




 It looks like a tiny leg, doesn't it? Nice piece--these are best cleaned up with a stiff toothbrush and warm soapy water. You can "file" them down a bit this way as well and expose more of the crinoid--I have many of these from the great lakes region. 









 Is it magnetic? Also, photo is not good quality but does it look glassy? Cleavage "swirly" or angular? 




 Oddly enough, over by the airport there are some construction sites that are abandoned. I found some great barites, geodes and other great stuff similar to this. I was just there for a work trip but rockhounding me--had my ride leave me off to go search through the dirt first. 




 What a great little piece of land they have. Unfortunately the larger photos of their recent finds aren't showing. Beautiful piece though! 




 These look a lot like those that can be found in abundance around Boulder (aptly named) Colorado and the surrounding area. Cool! 














 Would be helpful to know where they were found for the fossil one at the bottom...these look similar to some small marine specimens that are common in the Great Lakes region. 



















 Thanks! Is there a certain curvature or other feature to keep an eye out for? I am nowhere near Utah but I will be near other places smaller ones will be found. Your insights very valuable, thanks! 




 Incredible finds! How did you ID them at first (were they partially exposed, etc.?) 














 Need some size reference for one thing...
