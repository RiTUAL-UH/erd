 My deepest, sincerest condolences. 

I hope you can see the experience as a gift.

I truly, truly do. I think it was a gift bestowed on Diane, because she's way more deserving of it than me. I'm very thankful for every single moment she spent in my life.  




 Thank you very much.  




 Thank you, sincerely. I feel like sharing it lifts a small portion of the burden off of me. Sometimes I feel guilty that I was given an opportunity that people more deserving than me long for. 

I can only guess that it was either: actually a blessing bestowed on Diane (as she deserved a granted wish more than anyone I know), or that I *needed* an experience like that more than most, due to my own spiritual weakness. 




 Thank you. I think I will. Eventually.  




 Thank you for your kind words. I'm grateful that my experience can be meaningful to others.
