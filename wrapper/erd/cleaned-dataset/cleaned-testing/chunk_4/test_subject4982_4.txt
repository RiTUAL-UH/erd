 Hell yeah I will! I need a large cover up here soon, will stop in on a day off!  




 Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo 




 Cheers from Sylvania! 




 Having an alcoholic father and being an alcoholic myself, please do not stop this journey. I found my father for dead after a long day of us both binge drinking (not together) and was so messed up I couldn't save him myself. I hope the best for you and your journey. I wish my father could watch me go through mine.  




 Wait- do you have an extra tooth?  




 Gummo!!!!! Wtffff  




 TaTU 




 Danielle? Doug? Greg?  




 The pimple does not do the mustache any justice... 




 I love you sir.  




 Handsome!  




 A dream of mine.  




 Confradulations Johnathan! You are an amazing being. Keep up the good work and always remember there are people out there you don't even know who admire you!!  




 /r/popping plz we would love this there  




 She had her "Dead girls Don't cry" tattoo then and a few others, smaller breasts, added a lot when she got into the film industry. I'm from Toledo so it was an easy drive.  




 She's one of my favorites. When she used to strip in Dayton friends and I would go see her.  




 The only porn star that has absolutely flawless skin is Bonnie Rotten. Plus she's stunning without makeup which is hard to find these days in the adult film industry.  




 My eyes 




 You poor thing.  




 First off I agree with the people that are saying it's the eyebrows. That's a big part of it. Also, the woman is AGING. We all get older and all age differently. She hasn't been using fillers either...leave the woman alone. We have other issues in the world to worry about other than her appearance. Priorities people.  




 Damn Catholics. 




 You are beautiful! 




 As a graphic design artist you can clearly tell this is photoshopped. Better luck next time!  




 Ypuuuu first set are gorgeous. 




 This melts my heart.
