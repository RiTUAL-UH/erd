 Cool. I guess I'll be paying more attention to them in the future if this is the type of content they put out.  




 Easy there, Meryn Trant.

  Why are so many people defending the cop if the cop's fucking BOSS won't even defend him?

Because the boss knows that the media is going to lynch the guy if he doesn't get rid of him. The guy is now gone so the boss just had a big problem solved.

 Be more delusional. He got her face down on the ground like cops are supposed to do when detaining people who are unruly or who won't follow instructions.  














  
 PLEASE HELP! That (now viral) video of the officer in McKinney subduing a girl in a bathing suit was in OUR neighborhood. The situation was NOT what is being reported
 
 A DJ setup in a public space next to the private pool in our neighborhood on Friday and played loud explicit (F-bomb) music for multiple hours (it is unclear if he was invited by a resident as no one has claimed responsibility). The teenagers (both black and white) were being brought into our neighborhood by the carload because the DJ was tweeting out invites to a pool party for $15 (obviously unauthorized by our neighborhood). The teens began fighting with each other and pushing their way into our private pool. Some were jumping our fence. The security guard was accosted when he tried to stop the beginnings of this mob scene. Some residents who live around the park/pool area tried to come out and settle things down. The teens started yelling racial slurs at our neighbors and started assaulting people and property (throwing bottles at cars and attacking a mother at the pool with 3 young children). The first officer on the scene was by himself. At that time, the party had grown to a large, aggressive crowd. As the officer arrived, many teens started running through our neighborhood. Many of the teens were being very aggressive and yelling at the officers as more arrived.
 
 This was a very dangerous situation for the officers AND the teens/residents not involved. The news media has refused to hear the neighborhoods side of this story. The video being distributed is only a very small segment of what happened. This information being distributed by the media and others is extremely distorted and in some cases outright lies.
 
 PLEASE HELP US STOP THE BROADCASTING OF THIS IGNORANCE. The media is trying to make it look like our neighborhood is a whites only, racist area. Anyone who has spent even a few minutes in our area knows this is an outright LIE.

That is the account of a McKinney, Texas local.

Edit: For those complaining about my source, here is the same info from NPR.

The person who wrote what I posted here is a resident of the pool's community and they sent this out to media outlets. The man even provides his name but I won't post that since it's personal information. 




  most

So some did not and the cops were called because they were trespassing.  



















  "Tresspasser" is just a codeword for a black person amongst inhospitable white folk.

No, it's code for people that trespassed by accosting the pool security guard and climbing over fences to get into the pool when the rules of the pool state that you're only allowed to bring in two other friends with you to the pool. Random people showed up to this pool after some DJ tweeted about it and they didn't have a right to be there. The residents heard all of the loud noise coming from the hip hop music that was blaring, saw all of these people that clearly weren't residents of that community flooding towards the pool, saw altercations and fighting going on and then called the cops. They were trespassing.

 most of whom clearly lived there

You just supported my point for me. Not all of them were welcome there. Most might have been. Some were not and the cops were called because they were trespassing. 

 their parents' HOA dues pay for

Some of them weren't from that community and neither were their parents so I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe try facts when you make points. 

 And as for the non-residents, black residents are entitled to have guests just like everyone else.

Yeah, only when they follow the rules which they didn't. Some were trespassing and those who weren't brought more than two friends to the pool which is against the pool rules. 
 




  but why did he feel the need to pull his gun out?

[Because he thought that someone there had a gun and was about to pull it out on him.](https://imgur.com/a/hDZ0N)  




 He committed a crime so he ended up in jail like he should have. He stole something and was jailed for it. The issue in his case was that he stayed in jail too long without a trial, not that he went to jail.  




  So it's the children's fault

Yup, they were the ones trespassing and who were asked to leave by both the community residents and the cops and failed to do either.  




 Rapinoe is really good. Last World Cup she was a good right back or maybe a right winger with good crossing, now she's on the other side of the field and scoring goals on her own. 









 Yes, it's known as *The Anne Frank Spank Bank.* 




 Why isn't Tobin Heath starting? She's one of the best players on the team and can play in multiple positions incredibly well.

 Dat last scene with him and Shireen :'(

 I had to ask myself who was cutting onions but then I realized that it was just the smell of Davos making me tear up.  




 "Rarely is the question ever asked: Is our children burning?" 




 
And it seems to me you lived your life

Like a candle in the wind

Never knowing who to cling to

When the pain set in

And I would have liked to have known you

But you were just a kid

Your candle burned out long before

Mance Rayder ever did

   It was just a little sexual groping of one's sleeping sisters."

Lena Dunham sexually molested, groped, and masturbated next to her sleeping sister yet the media have little to say about her being a disgusting sexual abuser. I hate Sarah Palin and think she's a moron but I wonder why the media was largely silent on Dunham's disgusting transgressions that she spoke about without coercion while being all over The Duggars.

http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/lena-dunham-describes-sexually-abusing-her-toddler-sister 




 Sarah Palin called out the mainstream media double standard of going after them while giving their feminist golden child Lena Dunham a pass for sexually molesting her little sister for years. I think Palin is a retard but she does have a point and anyone who pays attention to the media knows that they have a liberal bias.

  Ronaldo had a birthday party organised after the Atletico match and of course he didn't know we'd get hammered. 

I wonder if Ronaldo knew that he would get hammered after getting hammered on the pitch. I thought that Ronaldo didn't drink.  




  Mara Salvatrucha (commonly abbreviated as MS-13) is a transnational criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles and has spread to other parts of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.[4] The majority of the gang is ethnically composed of Central Americans (mostly Salvadorans) and active in urban and suburban areas.

 My one solitary question is this: What in the name of God are violent El-Salvadoran gang members doing in New York and in America?
