 Where did you get all your star wars knowledge from? did you build it up over time? From where? 




 What IS canon? 




 Because of the force awakens right? 




 Thanks, do you have a link to where I can buy it? 




 I need to expand my knowledge of the SW universe, what are some good books, websites, tv shows etc that can help with this? I want to know more about the whole world including people, events, planets etc. Thank you very much!

Also, just a side question, what do we know so far about Episode 7's villain Kylo Ren? What is his place in the universe? 




 NSFW just in case. 









 Somebody needs to edit it onto the Batman v Superman trailer 




 I forget the name but there is one about the making of Apocalypse Now. Heart of Darkness I think it's called, it's about how much of a fucking nightmare the production of the film was.

Also, there's another one about film vs.digital cameras, the evolution of them both, which is better and why and where they are both going as in the future. It's called by Side by Side. 




 Fallout: Mad Max

Not that that's a bad thing... 




 Where is a good place on the net to start learning about the basics? Things like the different types of cameras, lenses, cameras in general and just the technical part of cinematographer, if someone could link me to a website, video etc that covers the basics of these topics, I would much appreciate it!

Also, does anyone know of any REALLY good books/essays on cinematography that would help a beginner like me?

And finally, does anyone know of any cinematography analysis videos/ essays? Anything that analyzes famous scenes or shots from films, or just analyzing someones work in general.

Thanks in advance!!

 Really? 




 That means every DC movie up until then will have IMAX scenes. 




 Murph 




 I am no pleb, I am a disciple of /r/moviescirclejerk 




 Thanks 




 He had a small role in Lincoln (2012). He was pretty good in that, but Daniel Day Lewis devours the screen. 




 What does that stand for? 




 American Beauty and Fight Club made me have a completely different outlook on life. After watching those films, I decided that I would NOT get a job where I'm stuck in an air conditioned room for hours on end doing a job I hate. I thought that waking up every morning at 7:00 and driving to the same place in the same clothes doing the same shit was NOT the definition of life and living. Unfortunately, I find myself looking down at these people who are stuck in this world; prisoners unto themselves and their jobs. I need to live, I can't be held back by working for people I despise. I want to be a cinematographer, a job where I can be outside and in different environments using my hands and skills to create films; a job where I meet different people, a job that I can learn and grow into.

Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg) youtube video also helped shape my new way of thinking.   




 If you liked it, check out Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels as well!! 




 That would be Snatch.

Awesome movie. 




 Well this is interesting. I actually liked the first one, but it's faults were definitely in it's writing. Fingers crossed for this and Blomkamp's Alien film, which I am skeptical about. 




 Only a poster.
http://i.imgur.com/0rlgnID.jpg

I should imagine we'll get one within the next 2 weeks.

edit: He said on Twitter it comes out this week 




 http://screenrant.com/girl-dragon-tattoo-movie-sequels-fire-hornets-web/ 









 I was just waiting for the fucker to bite the guys arm off. 




 * Daniel Day Lewis - Daniel Plainview, There Will Be Blood

* Brad Pitt - Tyler Durden, Fight Club

* Jake Gyllenhaal - Detective Loki, Prisoners - Louis Bloom, Nightcrawler

* Not a movie but Mathew Mcconaughey - Rustin Cohle, True Detective

 




 This may be the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I mean, sure I have my doubts, but this looks like a fun movie just judging from the trailer. Kids will enjoy, maybe even the parents. This could be a fun film the whole family can enjoy. Just kidding, this will probably be fucking terrible. 









 Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be.
(I mean come on, the remake is written and will be directed by the same guy who did True Detective!) 




 Im looking forward to The Visit. Looks like M. Night is going back to his roots with this one. Fingers crossed! 




 Dazed   Confused...? 




 I love it. I love Finchers style, so smooth and subtle and not over the top. I love the twisted eerie soundtracks that he uses in his films, I also love his under-lit environments. He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.   




 "Honey, get the shot gun" 




 "Do you bleed? You will"

That is an epic ass line. 









 We'll need more info 




 I wish. 




 [What Batman thinks about your opinions of the new trailer](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/037/e/1/middle_finger_batman_by_babs9-d5u3guy.jpg) 




 Is it as intense and sleek as the first 2? 




 Please don't spoil anything or give away too much, I'm just looking for some opinions on S3, is it as good as the others?

Thanks! 




 Anything that analyses the graphic novel. A link to a website or video would be great! I missed a lot of stuff in the book, i really want a better understanding. Also, the same for Arkham Asylum, anyone know a good analysis for that? Thanks a lot!! 




 oh... 




 The statue is not CGI, or the graffiti.

At some point in the film, public opinion will go against superman. Maybe something will happen, I don't know. 

When that 'something' happens, that's arguably where Bats comes into it.

People will turn against Superman in this movie, he might lose friends, politicans will want him, the military will want to contain him, all sorts of variables have been brought into the game as described by the teaser. So despite all this, will superman lose it? Will he lose faith in humanity? How do we know he won't be influenced by a villain, or be corrupted in some sort of way? The theory is that batman will be this sort of test, physically he wouldn't be much of a test, but mentally he would be.  




 Oh damn
 




 Wassat? 




 An old Joker.

Imagine the possibilities...  









 I've never seen a film in IMAX. How good is it, honestly? 




 Is this IMAX quality?  




 OP, can you please explain? 




 Because if you've seen the film Birdman, you'd understand. Also, it's a parody/turn on [this](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=birdman+poster biw=1536 bih=731 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=IjwzVZT2B4X5mAWdpIHoDg sqi=2 ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgrc=5P4cztbW0Xn-nM%253A%3BMNdGgvPqs7I3DM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fposters%252Fbirdman_xxlg.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fbirdman_xxlg.html%3B1278%3B2000) poster

 Ok, does he kick ass? 




 Without spoiling it, how much is Vision in the film? Pls don't say too much! 




 I feel jealous, because you had the absolute pleasure of watching it a first time.  




 wow, thanks for that.

However, could you elaborate a little more on why batman and superman fight? What did you mean by batman testing supermans resolve?  




 Did Batman ever take any shit? ahaha 




 As of yesterday, a cross between Whiplash and Birdman. 

Yes, I shit you not. 




 Now that you mentioned it, I totally agree. I thought Gosling was supposed to be directing it, my bad! 




 What can you guys learn about this bruce wayne from the trailer? Any comment/speculation would be much appreciated!

I'm trying to get a solid idea of what this portrayal of batman is about. What are his motives and values? I can tell that this is a completely different BW/Batman altogether, I just want to know why? 




 I hope this happens, but I'm not sure if Gosling is the right choice.  














 what? 




 Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before.
I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book. 

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

 I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman.
Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant. 

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR- I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen. 




 where can I get me one of those figurines? 

ARRGHHH PLEASE TELL ME! 




 Reservoir dogs  




 Since the first season did feel like a 8-9 hour long movie. 









 A have heard talk of a stand alone batman film, DC have announced it, but it is far from production. 




 At first I was laughing, then I remembered that this movie is actually coming out, then I cried. 




 Legend. 




 Hahaha 









 No order:

- Avengers

- Star Wars (hmm that trailer though)

- Spectre

- Mission Impossible Rogue Nation

- The Revenant 

Edit: also movies like fantastic four, ant man, Jurassic world, Southpaw I am also looking forward to. 




 Fight Club style? 




 Oh damn. 

This film is going to be biblical.  




 I recently watched the documentary 'The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness'. **SPOILER AHEAD** It says at the end that he has retired, but on his retirement sheet/form or whatever it says that he wishes to continue making anime for 10 more years. What does this mean? Is he working on something right now? I am so confused, I have found so many different things on the internet about what is going on with him. Can somebody PLEASE explain what is happening? Thanks so much!!

**I DON'T WANT HIM TO RETIRE :'(** 




 I just googled your whole description except for the beginning. 

I think the movie you are talking about is Wild (2014) 




 I doubt it. I think he took the pictures with a very good camera and later uploaded them to instagram via his computer. 




 I have asked people, they say I am not selfish and they say that I do not sound that way. Maybe it's just them trying to be nice. I just feel I sound that way, I'm not sure if people think the same or different to be honest. I said 'I' way too many times in this comment :/ 




 No of course not. 




 Thank you very much 




 I find that when I talk to people I sound snobby and selfish. I feel like the tone of how I talk sounds like only my opinion matters. I do not have any of these intentions however, It's just how I feel I sound. How do I get rid of this? I don't want to come off any selfish to people, as I am not a selfish person. Any help would be much appreciated, if you want me to elaborate further just ask! Much Thanks! 




 Oh, I got mine from JB-Hi-Fi, they had The Wind Rises, Kiki's Delivery Service and this. 




 Yep 




 Where did you get it? 




 You are welcome :) 




 Where's Spirited Away? O_O 




 Sleuth?  




 O.O

*sigh* Now I need to watch it again.. 




 You can get one [here](https://www.mightyape.com.au/product/Howls-Moving-Castle-10th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Blu-rayDVD/22816515) 




 Haha, I was in the shop just looking for the normal bluray for Howls moving castle when I look towards the end of the isle and I see a stand with that edition sitting on it. I just stared at it for 30 seconds straight. Then, as plain as a robot, I put the normal bluray back onto the shelf, walked towards the 10th anniversary edition, picked it up bought it, and marched out of the shop. My face was as blank as paper. 




 I wish they did one for Spirited Away.... 




 I am looking forward to ALL of those as well, also the new Steve Jobs movie is going to be awesome as well. 




 For The Revenant Im guessing. 



















 Absolute shite. 




 I was too goddamn late, but thank you. 




 The Godfather part 2. Because I haven't seen it and it's meant to be one the greatest films of all time. 









 Sorry, but what goes on here? Can someone please explain! 




 Awesome collection! They must be worth quite a lot by now. 




 Actually, I really quite like it. It's almost like that idea is a minimalism in itself.  









 You are very talented 




 Yeah it does have some unexpected humour. 




 I am currently 3 quarters of the way through the book, I am enjoying it so far, it is a little slow but that never seems to bother me in books or movies. Most of what's happening in the book seems to be build up, does it pay off in a big epic awesome way? Without spoiling anything, is the ending satisfying? What do you guys think of the book overall?  




 I am happy that he mentioned that infinity war part 1 and 2 will be separate stand alone films, instead of cliffhanger bullshit they pull nowadays.  




 I read that wrong. I read 'Stephen King to adapt Dark Tower series for Sony'.

:( 









 'It' is my fav, is the stand better than that? 




 hahahaha thats Vampires kiss 




 Everyone keeps saying its his best book. Please, I want to read it, I just need some encouragement from people who have read it!! 




 The Master. The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master. 




 They announced that as the series progresses, he adds padding onto his suit. Has anyone noticed this yet? I am only up to episode 4, for those of you who have seen further, does the suit get bigger/ better? 

I have no idea why I want to know this but whatever, thanks! 




 Oh, I think his line delivery is very authentic and overall good. 




 why do you think that? 




 So Marvel's Daredevil has just been released on Netflix, what do you think of it? I am liking the dark and gritty tone, also Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock is working out very well, supporting cast are also great. Let me know what your thoughts are :) 




 you're a little late 




 Nic Cage. 









 /r/TrueFilm will help you out. 




 What the actual fuck.  




 I approve. 




 Really? 




 big hero 6 




 He looks pretty good. My hopes for this film have only escalated.  









 About time. 




 onetruegod is hilarious.  




 The goddamn fucking pop-ups. The only thing that should be popping up is..well.....you know...
