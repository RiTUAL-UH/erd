 You can move 400km a year in a 4 acre plot of land.  




 Like a social net to fall on once you hit the streets. I know life can be extremely difficult for felons outside of jail (US), from getting jobs to finding a place to live. I'd like to see the differences between Euro countries and the US in this because I'm guessing that has a lot to do with ire-offending rates. 

I also think a big problem is the cultural stigma attached to felons outside of prison. Someone does 4 years and gets out but never loses that tag that makes him different.  




 This was a great post until the last bit where you went completely over-the-top-smug.

I agree that prison is for rehabilitation but it is also a fucking punishment for the crime/s you've committed. While I 100% agree drugs should never land you in prison, and jay walking shouldn't throw you in jail; there need to be appropriate consequences for people's actions. This man raped, drugged and murdered at least one girl. He was a doctor who was in a position of extreme trust. He drugged other people so that he could rape in peace. He hid from society (at least French society) to avoid punishment.

All I'm saying is some people absolutely deserve the attention and humane treatment that fosters rehabilitation; some people deserve to sit in a jail for the rest of their lives and be reminded that being a member of society is something for people who don't rape and murder kids. 

Also correlation/causation all that.  




 Quite a bit more than that bud.  




 I like how one minute she says "we're about to three-pear(lol) and the next sentence she tells him to move to Vegas to become a psychic because that's all he's doing." 




 Maybe because the question is 'what is something I can take to a party to make it great', not 'how can I throw a great party'. 




 Cold makes people tired over heat? Huh? 




 "Here Colby! Here boy! Goooood dog" 




 He was a rocket a couple seasons ago, we're familiar with him :) 




 I'm pretty level headed and I get downvoted for innocuous posts enough for it to be slightly grating on my nerves. Just seems like a different set of rules are applied to Rockets flair than others. Been subbed here 3+ years, have seen a huge shift in general attitude towards us. Gotten to the point where I don't come here after negative Houston things because the hate train is so strong. Oh well.  




 I've stayed pretty far away from here :p 




 I agree with the first statement. Good pick up, overpaying him made sense as Dirks window is closing, just like it would have made sense for us if Bosh signed here. Think the Mavs will be pretty good this year (3-5 seed) 




 Frankly, my impression has been that Houston talks more shit about Dallas.

That's my impression as well and I've lived in Houston for 24 years out of a possible 26. 




 Right thought, wrong flair. 




 What's true? 




 No worries, it's mutual :p

Though I'd take you over a Mavs fan. 




 Been anti rockets for a while now. Kind of annoying.  




 Been hating the rockets for about a year and a half really. Ever since the Harden honeymoon was over.  




 Makes sense and I know he loves Houston. Even though apparently we treat all our players like shit now.  




 Remember his post draft interview? Golden.  




 Forgot about Ariza, thought you were calling TJones above average defender.  




 He butted heads with Adelman, got traded and I think he's playing overseas now. 

He was spectacular against LA though. 




 His post draft interview was spectacular (Rockets originally drafted him). He was so so so raw when he first got in the league though. Ended up playing 2 minutes per game w/ us for one season. 

Still a memorable player to me just because of his interview though. 

E: lol jk thought I was in the Joey Dorsey thread  




 see: flair 




 welcome to the life of a rocket fan on /r/nba.

subscribed here for 3.5 years. crazy how different rocket flair is seen from just 2 years ago. 




 Confidence is unwavering I feel like. Cockiness comes and goes.  




 When did I say that? We didn't have any players worth being franchise loyal to before Harden and Howard. Can you really blame the FO for not matching Parsons once Bosh was out of the equation? He'd would have been making more than harden. The Rockets would have had zero flexibility moving forward with a team that didn't make it out of the first round last season. 

I'll admit our roster has been a revolving door since Yao went down but franchise players don't just fall into your lap. Howard was obviously comfortable enough with the FO to take less over resigning with the Lakers.  /r/nba just has on shit colored spectacles when it comes to the rockets. 




 No, it counts towards luxury tax just not the cap. That why the NBA has a soft cap. Les would absolutely have been paying luxury tax.  




 See his comments last night? Doesn't appear so.  




 Asik didn't want to be in Houston. Do people not remember that? He was trying to move Asik to a team where he could play more and we wouldn't have such a redundant player. Did people really forget the whole Asik basically saying "trade me" after we signed Howard? 




 I'm sorry but how were Asik and Parsons treated poorly exactly? 




 Roy Hibbert? 




 Like shit? How was Parsons treated like shit? How was Asik treated like shit? Besides the jersey thing, which could have easily just been a marketing team's really dumb error, how was Lin treated like shit?

Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston

Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?

Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.

You people seem to think that this is a church peewee league or something.  




 How was Asik disrespected? 




 You realize just last year we made a major free agent signing with Howard right? And the year before Harden happily signed our extension. We haven't had anyone to be loyal to since Yao faced premature retirement. Which player has the Rockets had in the past 6 years who deserved the kind of loyalty that Duncan, Dirk, Kobe, etc. got?

 




 It's a fucking organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In what universe are you expecting them to "be nice". Yeah, they didn't roll out the red carpet like a superstar for the guy, but he was treated extremely well while he was here and conversely he treated us extremely well. Had we signed Bosh, he would have been rewarded directly by us with an instant match of his offer sheet (which would have cost owner Les Alexander a tremendous amount of luxury tax). As it turns out he was rewarded, just by a team up interstate 45. 

What more do you want them to do? Be nicer? Jesus, this isn't Sunday school.  




 And we tried pretty fucking hard to trade Asik before the trade deadline. Fuck Morey for snagging the #1-2 center in the league, right? How else were we supposed to treat the guy? "Well Asik, we have a chance to sign Dwight Howard but we gave you a 3 year deal so we're stickin with you big guy!"

Give me a break guys, this is a cut throat business. 

E: also a funny point is that the reason it was so hard to move him last year was because of HIS FUCKING EXPENSIVE CONTRACT MOST TEAMS DIDNT WANT TO TOUCH! 




 They drafted him, gave him a starting role for 3 years where he has able to build up his product(him) to be worth 15 million dollars per year. By opting out of his 4th year option *they* created his market. Perfect storm for Chandler, desperate Cuban for a huge FA Signing.

So I'd say they did a little bit for him....  




 He could be the 3rd star if the first two were LeBron James and LeBron James.  




 He's done it 3 other times and matched instantly each time until now.  




 Our comparable Dirk would have been Yao. Yao's career ended prematurely. Sorry we weren't nicer to him so he'd stay injury free. You have to have that special player first before you can't treat them well. And I guess to get to that discount we have to overpay for him first (by the way think it's a good contract for y'all as Dirk's widow is small - but a bad contract for us). So while I think y'all are overpaying for him, it makes sense, like it would have made sense for us to overpay him if we had signed Bosh.  




 and the mods allow for all sorts of opinions. good community too.

thumbs up emoji 




 Fair enough, can't say I stuck my head into that area very much, or at all. I generally don't like 'fandom' or the entitled culture which surrounds a large population of sports observers/fans. Like, you (not *you* - the proverbial you) watch 3 fucking games a week, fuck off with your (not *your* - the proverbial your) self centered metric of success and constant diversion between throwing players under the bus when performing poorly and hand jobs when good abounds.
 




 I really like the writers on the Rockets blog 'The Dream Shake'. Good basketball analysis mixed with (from what I see) fair shakes at the players. 




 lol funny you said that. just spent like 15 minutes writing this up.

http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2agal2/lin_traded_to_the_lakers/ciusr4i

to answer your question: no, I stopped going to the forums a few years ago. 




 Yeah it's a pretty shitty forum. bsk4 must not have been going there for a long time. The whole contingent of 'player only fans' started with Yao when half of the posters were Chinese fans who only gave a shit about Yao and not the Rockets. Even before that though you had the old guard who would do nothing but compare the current squad to the championship era of Hakeem - dubbed 99ers (because they were original members when the board was founded in 99 - fun fact: i got banned from clutch fans about 5 years ago for telling Tinman (like The King of 99ers), to gobble on some dicks and stop talking the "good old days" so much). Honestly though, 'player/era only fans' aren't even the worst part. It's very knee-jerk, players (and coaches) get thrown under the bus constantly and are swiftly pulled out and kissed on the forehead when they play up to the expectations of entitled observers. Fickle, unintelligent posters abound, caution.

To be fair, there are a few posters there who are extremely solid and possess impressive basketball minds (DaDakota, Big Moe, HayesFan to name a few who stick out), unfortunately they get drowned out by what you're talking about. 




 I really did not see that much hate against him from Houston fans this past season. Apparently I missed it?

Always seemed like Harden took the brunt of the hate train when things weren't going as peachy as entitled fans thought they should be. 




 Houston is also just in general a huge market.  




 Crazy how much that trade nix changed the landscape of the NBA in the 2010s.
 




 Poor DWade. Opted out of his 22 million dollar contract hoping LeBron would stick around. Now he'll be lucky to get 12. 




 **11** letters - 9/**11**

1+1 = 2. 2 Names. Dick Cheney.  




 Yet people act like him being benched for Beverly was some personal slight against Lin. 'Basketball reasons' is actually athing. 




 Wait, what? My jimmies looked rustled from my comment? I had a smile on my face after getting eliminated from the playoffs this year because basketball is cool and fun and getting stressed or angry over it is silly. 




 This makes me so happy. This is like, better than an ice cold topo chico on a hot summer day. 




 People act like the Melo thing was Les and Morey getting together and being like, "Lets show how little we care about Lin". While it was much more likely something like the Rockets design team making a innocent mistake. 




 Getting benched for a player who better suited the starting lineup is getting treated like shit? I didn't see the hate towards Lin that a lot of people on this board talk about. The jersey thing was tasteless but it could have been something as innocent as the design team not thinking the whole concept through, not a deliberate shot at him.
 




 Yeah I don't remember the exact details except that the contracts were dubbed "Poison Pill Contracts".  




 That is the cap hit against Houston. Pretty sure it's the full 15 million for any other team. Could be mistaken though and maybe the 15 million cap hit was only been if the Knicks matched. 




 I've been on reddit for almost 4 years and I think your comment is like the 5th I've upvoted, so kudos on that.   




 just picturing you literally sitting on your computer incubating your comment until the right time. 




 Wrong Chandler

AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT! 




 Know what else wouldn't be fair? If Cleveland cloned LeBron 10 times and then bombed an orphanage.

Or if an elephant sat on the last bowl of ice cream.
 




 And Bosh just swishin 12-15 footers all day erry day. Bosh is such an obscene upgrade for our PNR defense alone. Jones was absolutely garbage in that capacity. His team D was atrocious.  




 Chandler is coming to Houston in this scenario though (i.e. the SW being the Rockets division to lose by getting Bosh and resigning Parsons). 




 Wait what? That is such a sleek Spurs move. You just won a championship, now you are tricking the Mavericks into joining your cause by making them think the Rockets are more of a threat to win it all than y'all.

Sly. Very sly. And that's why the Spurs are the best. 




 Honestly thought it was too big, still do for any team that couldn't go over the cap to sign him.

 




 And trying is half the battle! 




 win/win 




 Right but the reward is still the same. The reward in both scenarios is Parsons. The likelihood of retaining the reward simply increases the larger the contract is. Same reward - Parsons - either way.  




 You'll never hear me defend Kevin McHale as a good coach, bruh. 




 I know it doesn't mean shit, I was comparing two meaningless sets of statistics. 




 Do you seriously think the Rockets would have beaten the Spurs

I never said that, but Dallas didn't beat the Spurs either.

The argument was that Dallas played good against the champs, so did the Rockets. The Rockets didn't have to play against the champs in the first round because they played better than the Mavs during the regular season. See how dumb all these arguments are? 




 The more they offer doesn't increase the size of the reward, just the likelihood that they'll get to keep the reward. Same reward either way.  




 If you change the 16 years to 26 years our historical perspective looks better than y'all's. What's your point? 




 I'm sure players measure historical precedent when they're deciding whether or not to join a team with the mission of winning a championship.

Pack it up everyone, the Mavs have reached the 2nd round more often than the Rockets over the last 15 years, clearly they're the superior horse to ride going forward.   




 And the Rockets swept the champs in the reg. season.  




 Oh shit...my mistake.  




 Lol was just being silly. My error! 




 I read it as *will take* at first and was like argh ! ! !  




 thought you said it wouldn't matter without them 




 Uh no, I'm saying they wouldn't have won them without Odom, Pau and Co.

e: i misread you i guess? 




 It's not at all true.  




 So is Macintosh Plus just another name she goes by? All the albums on that page are Vektroid even when they have another artist name on the bandcamp linked pages?

My music library needs to know for uniformity sake. 




 To be this is one of the most evenly matches knockout games so far besides CR and Greece.  




 Nothing to lose? How about a chance to play in another World Cup game?

I highly doubt the team is sitting around going "whelp we made it this far, let's just cut loose cuz we got nothin to lose." 




 Disagreed 




 I got some serious asperger vibes from this post. 

"My mom wasn't there to introduce us" - as a 20 year 




 See, regardless of whether he ends up a Rocket next season or not is irrelevant. This is Morey 101, if he feels that Parson's is being overvalued by the market, he wipes his hands and wishes the player good luck. If the market dictates a price that Morey feels is not only within his valuation but also fits with his 'grand plan', he'll have a new contract waiting for Parsons before he gets on the plane.  




 Everyone's loyal until they aren't. I could see him giving a small discount (-10% max), but he's only been here 3 years, has no historical ties to the area, and he already helped us out big time in getting Howard (and just in general by being the best value in the NBA during his contract). Hope he gets whatever he deserves.   




 That or she doesn't remember what attractive is.  




 I enjoyed this. It gets a little slow on the back end of some of the lyrical verses at times but otherwise good stuff.  




 Ouch. I can see this on a late night monologue soon.  




 Agreed, instead of talking about basketball let's not talk about basketball. 

So how about that Elon Musk? Cool chap, aye?
 




 y'all are cute 




 "karma" 




 satire? 




 teehehehehehehhee 




 While I agree the fans are better, it's definitely not more entertaining. Collegiate football is not nearly on the same skill level as the NFL, it's like saying you'd rather have an architecture student design your house because 'they're more passionate'.

The difference between the NBA and NCAAB is even bigger. 




 Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride. You honestly have no way of actually knowing if something happened or not, so why get bent up with negative feelings that someone is "tricking you" for "karma"? 




 You take reddit way too seriously. 




 Therefore, they're all lies. 




 Thanks for letting us all know what is funny and what isn't funny, arbitrator of comedy. 




 he has said all the right things 

not that I disagree, but saying and doing are two very different things. he had the reputation for a reason. 




 No he signed an extension after the playoffs.  




 Bosh would have to take a min contract for that to work out.  




 Gotta beat them for a ring either way.  




 Really happy for Costa Rica. Spent one of the best years of my life living there during my senior year of high school (which incidentally was the last time y'all made it to the world cup - 2006). Unfortunately y'all didn't do as well then as you are doing now (think y'all went 0-3?).

Buena suerte Costa Rica!
