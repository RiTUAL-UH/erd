 It is the correct format, probably can't be parsed because it goes into next year. 




 The plugin, being from /r/ultrahardcore, I feel that the plugin is 100x better, for no ghast tears, enderpearl damage can be toggled, player heads, golden heads; with all of this, I feel makes the game a lot better and more strategic. 




 The overall format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 The correct format for this match is Oct 06 01:30 UTC - Cheesy's #3 To3 




 Sep removes them from extreme hills and chests.

 Thanks Obama 




 I wish more kills to you, and death upon you at the same time :D 




 Next time, your post must be at least an hour in advance. 




 Whitelist isn't off.

 test_subject5099 




 I did then lol 




 Walden, matches cannot be posted less than an hour in advance. Do not be surprised if this is taken down.  




 I was in the game :L 




 Then don't, but we really don't either. 




 He made the best out of a bad situation :D 




 Listen D4, your post is going to be removed because only mods can post goodbyes. Sorry to see you go, but rules are rules. 




 To add to this, this was 2 hours ago. However, being that it doesn't say impromptu, as much as I want it to be today, is probably tomorrow. 




 The civilization crumbles, and you walk quietly back in, and we all listen, all of us, in spirit.  




 Maybe the one that isn't an asshole.
 




 "isn't" 




 Then that is not an allies game, thats a long distance to2 with solos. 




 You can always backstab in an allies game. 




 I can't get the ip to work, can you supply the number ip? 




 Incorrect formatting, the correct format for this match is Sep 24 00:45 UTC - Awalk's To2 w/solos 




 and maybe test_subject5099?

 Sep 22 16:00 UTC - MCRuler10 #1, FFA (Return of Funk)***
I only assume its today. 




 Sep 22 07:00 UTC - FFA - Big Toe's Impromptu #12* :P 




 RTo5 means random teams of five, so there is no guarantee you can play with your friend. 




 Sep 22 09:00 UTC - * 




 When sessions go up everyone jumps like this and it DDOSes the servers so they time out again. 




 No golden apples or heads? 




 Sup 




 Yes, but on an even higher level, where one enters the nether or things of that nature, especially with things like enderrush. I played a few of those games though, and sometimes it helped me get gold or diamonds I wouldn't normally see right away. 




 You are able to toggle it in default minecraft I believe, but I would like to see scenarios using this functionality.  




 and a hyphen :P 




 "Date and Time: Sunday, September 16 02:00 UTC (09:00 PM EST)" 02:00 UTC is 10 EDT :P
 




 Also, how many allies? 




 Guy, the format you want to use for this particular match would be: Sep 16 20:00 UTC - DIg224#1 Vanilla FFA with Allies 




 The correct format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 Is it FFA or To3?, it says To3 in the post. 




 I got pots (which yes, can make this completely invalid, but it was still pretty cool) and I went to 0,0 with 30 minutes left in the game, then, I see a guy, do a typical st2 2 shot, then it gets interesting. I see another guy in the desert, 2 shot him, see 2 more in the distance, run up and kill them both, turn around and kill another, and then go down into a temple to re-brew and heal. All this took less than a minute. As it turned out, there was enough diamonds left on the ground for full diamond, but I couldn't pick them up. :D (I won after 2 more kills if you didnt guess) 




 Once again, please use the correct format: Mmm DD HH:MM UTC(space)-(space)(title) 




 Announcement flair is for moderators only. 




 The format is UTC(SPACE)-(SPACE)(Title) :P xD, definitely don't delete and repost, just remember for next time. 




 As long as you know the rules, its not a problem. 




 I mean, at least the impromptus would follow the rules, they werent even posted an hour in advance.

No need for a mod to message you, it is against the rules, pushing your game back 15 minutes would suffice, but rules are rules, and while there may be enough players for all three, many time there are not, so please follow the rules. 




 While it is true that he does host everyday, and hosting an FFA at the same time, there should still be players, then there is no problem with holding the FFA back 15 minutes for people that want to play that, correct? Rules are Rules, even if they dont matter at one point, they do at another. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier, and the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title) 




 Please use the correct format, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title), and you may want to add some additional information, such as the nether, length of the game, and number of people.  




 The game that prompted crimson to write this was an ffa with one ally, and no backstabbing, to give some context, long distance to2 is basically that, in its entirety, for one change and one only, no teleport. 




 "Long Distance" To2 with solos and FFA with allies of 1 and no backstabbing are the exact same thing, infact, I've seen some hosts tp allies together before, there has to be a set description for these scenarios, it seems just too common that the two blend together. 




 1: No, I cannot record.
2. Anytime on the weekends or anything from 18:30 - 02:30 UTC
3. Teams, but only due to my inability to record, teaming with players who can would be beneficial. 




 Do you have an alternate ip? I cannot resolve the hostname due to the type of ip this is.
