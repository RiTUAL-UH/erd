 Did no one tell them that storage manufacturers say 1 GB is 1000 MB and most software techs say 1 GB is 1024 MB? 




 How can we say that dark matter isn't the 'aether/ether' of our time similar to how at the turn of the 20th century there was aether/ether to explain things that were eventually explained by general relativity, Brownian motion, and that sort of thing?

 Now if they combine their printer tech with a bin and component arm to place the LEDs automatically, they'll win.

 Sometimes I wonder if more cities (or civil contractors) talked about strategies to deal with what weather does to roads and other infrastructure we'd have a lot better roads.

(Yes, I know, taxes pay for roads and Phoenix has more) 




 Don't complain about that bloatware and Atom chip performance once you get it now :) 




 Has anyone made a miniature version of this to test it? By miniature I mean like model trains miniature.
