 This isn't the 1990s where SSL slows down the connection to a website, we have servers and computers powerful enough to handle that issue now.

Also, anyone can spy on you without SSL enabled on all websites. 

Also HTTP2 protocal and update which is coming out is going to force the majority use of SSL which makes a more secure internet in the end
