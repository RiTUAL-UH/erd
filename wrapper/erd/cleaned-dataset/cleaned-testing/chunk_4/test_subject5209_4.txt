 That should be "Bill *Fuckin'* Murray." 




 Gotten into better shape when I was in high school and  still had a fast metabolism.  Weight is difficult to lose the older you get. 




 Have a custom pen created that writes in a mixture of ink and my blood. 




 Knowledge. 




 I'd kill a circus clown by shoving a crumpled pair of speedos down his throat...and then watch as the rest of his face turned the same color as his fake nose.  
  
When the cops go to pull out the murder weapon...it's an endless line of multi-colored speedos. 




 God. 




 When my wife starts talking, my dog just looks at her with a blank stare...and then licks his wiener. 




 Make loud, sexual noises the entire time they are interviewing you. 









 Mine was about the sexual positions that I think the [Duggar family](http://www.duggarfamily.com/) would use. 









 [Amber Lamps](https://youtu.be/dDD9FmdmUN4) 




 When I was a kid, I didn't even like peeling shrimp...because I would have to touch their legs. 




 Ok.  Whew, that was close. 




 Are you me? 




 Private investigator? 




 Teacher? 




 Going to see Avengers: Age of Ultron next week. 




 If you have a job that offers a 401K...take advantage of it as soon as you can. 




 North Korea. 









 I like the shorter ears. 




 Thanks. 




 I liked the direction that went.  Now, I'm wondering what the dude sold his soul for.  Was it for the talking tat? 




 I have, but only just recently.  
  
About a month ago, she told me that she didn't love me anymore.  So, now I feel my role in this house is as a father only and not a husband.  
  
I'm on depression meds now, so...meh. 




 Too many fingers to be Mickey Mouse.  Childhood = unharmed. 




 Together for 4 months, married for 6 years.
  
I met her through a dating website and now I wish I would've spent that membership money on something that would actually love me back...like chicken wings and beer. 









 [George Lucas](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/31254/lucas%20laughing.jpg) can do that, too. 




 What would donut holes be then - do holes? That just sounds wrong...and I like it. 




 Polka Dotted Dick? 




 I never understood that one. What is red about it?? 









 Just because I've seen [creepier](http://media3.giphy.com/media/20uebR9TtbLwI/giphy.gif)... 




 If I were going to adopt, that's what I would tell the adoption agency. 




 How do you do that by accident? 




 Did you find out what it was exactly? 




 Geez, did they cut it with Kool-Aid? 









 [Take a look at the Batwing, bitch!](https://youtu.be/2T0G0njiNrA) 




 Hell, I'd buy one. 









 He's in [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4362342/) now.  It's an interesting show, but once again he carries his co-host...IMO. 









 Varsity Blues 









 [Kralik](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110429204417/prisonbreak/images/5/59/JeffKoberZachary_Kralik.gif) and then [Rack](http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/1293682/600full-jeff-kober.jpg).  
  
Different actor, but they also cast the same guy that played [Luke](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/buffy/images/2/2d/Luke.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110127011204) for [The Judge](http://www.thiel-a-vision.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/judge.jpg). 




 Oh, God, you're killing me! 




 [Already done.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288415/) 




 Hundreds and thousands of what? 




 What flavor is blue cake exactly? 




 I do that, too. A cold egg roll is fantastic for a morning snack. 




 A co-worker of mine has a son that owns an Indian restaurant. He always invites me to join him, but I haven't been able to make it. I may have to take him up on that offer.

Any good suggestions? 




 You down with OP'sM'sP? 




 Wow! That should be a buffet item at Golden Corral.  Meatloaf, chicken casserole, a chocolate fountain, and pussy.

 I find your choice of breakfast foods rather [shallow and pedantic](https://youtu.be/yetwdpsiM8Q). 




 Who is Food and why are you taking it from h...oh wait, never mind. 




 Did you eat it at 4:20 in the morning? 




 Emotional pain and sadness or asshole pain and sadness? 




 I don't eat Indian food and that is making me drool. 




 Would you eat that combo if you had to eat them all at once?  Wrap your Mars bar in a fruit rollup and take a bite of it while having a bite of the cauliflower cheese? 




 How many calories are in a serving of pussy?  Is it "heart-healthy"? 




 That doesn't seem like a lot of cereal...unless you hide ostrich eggs for Easter. 




 Daryl? 




 I've never heard of that before.  I don't eat a lot of Indian cuisine, though...so maybe that's why.  It looks good. 




 That's one of my favorites.  Something about the cold grease on top of the pizza.  Mmmm. 














 I work in the same environment and have had the same exact issue.

Sales manager at our sister plant in a different city calls IT. Says she has a new hire sitting in a cubicle, ready to work. No form was submitted to our department, letting us know anything about the new hire.

She asks what we can do for the new employee that day. I told her that we can give him some magazines to read until his thin client is set up, which normally doesn't take too long since we happen to have some in stock. Unfortunately, since she waited to tell us about the new guy...the new guy is going to wait until  *we*  get ready for him to work.

It may seem like we in the IT department are assholes, but everyone else is a bunch of bastards! 




 Sustained.  Bailiff, get me a badger for the witness. 




 Keystone Light needs to use this in a magazine ad...NOW!! 




 Well, the tube says to avoid getting in your mouth or eyes.  Now we see why.

 That's not gonna look good on the old resume. 




 Did he suffer from adult-onset [diabeetus](http://i452.photobucket.com/albums/qq245/ripalamungalin/i-dont-always-eat-cake-diabeetus.jpg)?

 Sprinkle some coke on her lips and plant a knife.  A real knife, not a rubber one.   
  
Made that mistake one too many times... 




 I'm wondering...how so? 




 It's perfect, because a jury would never think you would be able to pull that off like that.
