 Good Luck! 









 Definitely the worst thing about these games, to be honest, anything that fuels the war machine makes me sad. Glad we have games like Metal Gear, Spec Ops and This War of Mine to spread the counter message. 




 Bokoblins are definitely un-serious asses, haha! https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i rct=j q= esrc=s source=images cd= cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CAcQjRw url=http%3A%2F%2Fzelda.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FBokoblin ei=Cdk9VYO_IobdmAXo94CQBw bvm=bv.91665533,d.dGY psig=AFQjCNGckN7KRDSiWz1l4-N4jfQ8zVuHvA ust=1430203024278442 scare the hell out of me in SS though, dunno why! 









 He's super right about the unhelpful behavior on people's part. Gopher seems like a very cordial and kind hearted individual and I agree with him that the negative rage/abuse/bullying etc. is not helping the point of view against the current system.
I feel sorry for the mod authors, simply taking an opportunity presented to them, it's not being a horrible person to want money for your creations.

We just need to be empathetic towards each other as human beings, ya know?

 I always thought it would be cool to be able to change Link's gender or hair color. 

Thoughts? 




  But why does one thing being a problem mean that we can't try and fix other things?

I agree with you, I'm not saying it's a reason to not try to fix things, I'm more trying to tease out discussion on the topic :) 




 Thanks for your response, the power angle is very interesting. I often compare the power difference when contemplating other subjects, good idea to apply it here. 




 Could you expand on that? I'm aware of that idea that sexualized women + the violence can direct the tone in a really unsettling fashion (e.g. hitman), but does sexualization inherently and problematically tie into violence for every game? Bikini chainmail female warrior fighting a monster, is that sexual violence when compared to a beautiful man in no clothes fighting the same monster?

I'm not arguing the idea, I can feel there's something wrong there but I need further clarification to build my own understanding. 

Thanks :) 




 Thankyou interesting point. 




 Yeah Jim Sterling did a very good video about this a while ago, actually. Its an interesting point. 




 good point, changed my post specifically about the design and not other elements of objectification. 




 Accidently deleted my text in my post, so I have to redo:

If 50% of objectified characters were adult men, in the exact same fashion as the sexualized adult women (not the male idol fallacy, but actual objectification for the straight female gaze, or whatever) would that help the situation of objectified characters?

I should note I'm not talking about third person leery camera movements, I'm talking about design of the character. I don't think anyone really likes cringeworthy camera shots of a boob or bum or a package, but if a character is wearing skimpy clothing and they own it - equally between the sexes, does it become less of an issue?

I understand two wrongs don't make a right, but if we are going to focus on moral issues in games, isn't violence more problematic in that regard? 

I'm a sex positive bisexual male, so I'm definitely not interested in sex and sexuality being a taboo and I don't mind looking at objectified men in games either!, but I am not in the right position to make a clear assessment myself so I'm curious what people's thoughts are on adult characters being treated 50-50 equivelant. 




 That is amazing! 




 Hey man, sorry you didn't like the post, what do you think immersion means in terms of gameplay?

Cheers :) 




 This game sounds a lot more interesting than I initially assumed, the art style looks beautiful and the adventuring looks simple but fun! gonna have to try it out, nice! 




 If a game has a female protagonist, it much more easily grabs my interest. I just really enjoy playing as another gender than my own, it's like games give me an experience I don't have in my day to day that I can empathize with and find appeal in.

Saving this video. 




 Thanks everyone! I have added a revised art style at the top of the post :) lemme know what I can change :)
