 But I am bored everyday... 




 I am very bored today :(

 Student... 




 I know that... That's why I asked why he edited it...  




 *On the bed now* 




 Feeling very sleepy now :P 




 Hmmm.... Science stream here has Physics, Chemistry and Maths... Along with a bunch of languages. 




 11th and 12th would be Science stream, and then I would probably go for Computer Science... 




 Yup, will be pursuing Science stream... 




 I just finished my 10th grade... 




 1.30 AM :P 




 What's the time there? 




 :P 




 XD 




 :D 




 So you're chilledUK! 




 Lol, why the hell did he edit that? 




 You really think so? 




 Where are you? 




 Too damn hot... 41C :( 




 In India, they're not... 




 Yup. You would be considered holy... 




 You would be respected a lot in my country... 




 **ALL HAIL THE COW!** 




 **ALL HAIL /u/chilledchile!** 




 But why would you chill them? 




 Humans who go out to work? 




 :P 




 Birds? 




 :D 




 Kinda bored to sleep... 




 But what about the animals? 




 I actually won't now... Probably an hour later... 




 I am very sleepy now :( 




 Why is Chile being chilled? Wouldn't the people there freeze? 




 Big timezone difference! In which country are you? 




 Why chilled? Why not chillingchile? 




 12.34 AM. You? 




 Why chilled? Why not hot? 




 Yeah, that would really be cool! 




 Why Chile? Why not Argentina? 




 But many users are reporting the touchscreen issues... 




 chilled chile

Why not chilled tomato? 




 India! 




 Anybody else excited?


You think anyone won't be? 




 Hey, what's going on? 




 Sure! Will you book the air tickets? :D 




 Might watch it this weekend... 




 How's it? 




 Which movie? 




 Yes :) What about you? 




 :) 




 Thanks for the help! I am getting a Nexus 5 for around 18000... 




 You don't need to be :D 




 Not exactly, I am just getting bored :'( 




 My sister has a Moto G2, and I am looking to upgrade from a Moto G1... The Moto G's hardware is falling behind, and there is no price drop in the last-gen flasgships in India :( 




 Yup. 




 What about a Nexus 5? I am getting one on eBay... 




 But Asus is horrible with updates...
 




 My 10th grade just ended! 




 What does Junior grade mean? There's nothing like that in my country... 




 No school... Vacations are going on... Which grade are you in? 




 Nothing much, just browsing... 




 I am fine, just too bored :( 




 The Z3 is too costly here :( 




 Hey, how are you doing? 




 Should I still buy the OnePlus One? Is it still worth it?  




 Duare


Time to kill yourself. 




 #BuyANexus 




 I'm 16 and I am currently doing nothing in my vacations :P 




 :) 




 It sure is :D 




 But I don't think I have the courage to do that :P 




 But I never tried it :( 




 Parkour seems interesting... 




 What's your favourite sport? 




 Nexus 10


Damn, you're old. 




 Now your turn, truth or dare? 




 Telling my friends extremely boring jokes! 




 What's that? 




 Truth! 




 Praise DuARTe! Praise #Materiyolo! 




 Plus, Android 5.1.1 on the Nexus 5 is a joy to use. 




 Photo taken with an iPhone. 




 I hate TouchWiz. 




 Awesome!!! 




 The Nexus 5 is pretty good at this stage. You still get all the updates, it's stock Android, and the hardware is still good. The phone still runs like a champ. Do you really need a Galaxy S6, then?...  




 Dare: go to /r/circlejerk and post "Comcast is actually good." 




 You deliver!!! 




 Go to /r/androidcirclejerk and post "iOS is awesome!". 




 Truth! 




 I 3 BCCI. They're awesome! 




 I love Manjrekar's commentary. 




 All the best! 




 Now you have started! 




 Okay, I  seriously will stop that now :D 




 Okay... Okay... I will stop :P 




 I might try... to stop that XD 




 Yeah, it does feel like a... pause :P 




 That's kinda... funny! 




 XD 




 I'm a time traveller :P 




 Almost... It's 11.22 PM here... 




 Yeah, that's just too far away. And also a bigger change in the timezone... 




 #HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET! 




 Almost across the world... 




 /uj I wish that app would work in India :( 




 I'm in India...
