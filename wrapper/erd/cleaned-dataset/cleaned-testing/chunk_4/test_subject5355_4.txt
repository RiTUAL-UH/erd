 lisa simpson bart imagination. proof:

1) every1 in the family is dumb but also bart is dumb and homer and marge is dumb and maybe maggie is dumb but lisa be smart. this leads to conclusions that she is adopt or in barts imagine

2)lisa simpson is not truly around all the time sometime she not around sometime she is but always because bart imagined her

3) bart bad grades = dream up lisa amsipon so he feel good about bad grades

4) lisa simpson

5) in some episode lisa simpson in other episodes bart simpsons

6)you never seen ne1 alse talk to lisa simpsons but when they are its actually they are talking to bart who look like lisa for the audiance or lisa is imagined next 2 bart for audience

that is my teory 




 There is no widely accepted theory for either.

When people say shit like that, I doubt they're seriously considering the existing of Universes, let alone assuming that all universes must be 'parallel'. They're simply creating nice thoughts from their current situation, so those thoughts would naturally depend  on re-assuring them, which a parallel universe would serve to do.
 




 You're right, but I think it's a fair to assume he doesn't have a source in this instance since he opened his post with "I THINK" 




 No, opinions are fine on ELI5. You're acting as though they are worthless. Opinions, supported by reasoning, precedent and logic can still potentially be valid and are just fine in lieu of facts. The only issue is if it's presented as a fact, which 004forever didn't do, it's clearly an opinion.

Edit: You're fucking retarded. 




 Not a stupid question, your logic is sound. Your assumptions are not.

My thinking is that if a shitty video doesn't load, I'm more likely to go to another website and do something else, rather than watch more videos.

Google has this data. They can see how much traffic they can get. They can read through piles of feedback. They have the resources to make the change. But they haven't. The odds of it just being pure stupidity on Google's part is quite low.

Most likely, any people refusing to use YouTube because of the occasional video hiccup are probably not anywhere near enough in size to warrant a massive and expensive change in infrastructure. As far as I can tell, YouTube is still growing or at least stabalised in the first place, so I don't even think this problem exists. Lastly, what alternative? There aren't many competitors and what few there are certainly aren't popular.  




 I'm thinking so. It basically just seems like it would be TOO strong if it prevented blinking with just the Aghs. This puts higher limits on an OD Aghs wombo combo. It would just be too easy to set up, as opposed to heroes like Magnus or Enigma who at the very least have to jump into the fight first. 




 Correct, doesn't change the fact that over time that style of sitcom has become boring to me. I still appreciate that it was unique at it's time - like I said, I loved it. But I was simply saying that, over time, it loses what makes it unique because it is now the standard. Hence why it probably doesn't appeal to today's market to quite the extent it did in the 90s.

It's just one of many options today, and many people are sick of the formula before even considering giving older sitcoms a chance. 




 Way, I was even further off than you guys. I thought it was "gotta love those Starbuck's lovers", as some sort of stab at the hipster movement or... something. 




 To an extent. I used to really, really love Seinfeld, but each time I rewatch it my opinion of it lowers a little. It was great... for it's time. By today's standards it is very much the typical sitcom. Especially in the later seasons. 




 I think there are two reasons people believe this whole thing about 'ridiculous law suits':

1) People misinterpret the word 'sue', as OP has clearly done, or assume that because someone is suing someone they've probably won. A newspaper reports that a burgler is suing a homeowner because he tripped over while stealing their TV. People jump on ship and say how wrong it is, without realising that it hasn't gone to court yet, and he'll probably lose.

2) The flipside: the newspapers don't report enough detail, and people assume the party doing the suing is wrong, when in reality there is a good reason for it. The famous McDonald's hot coffee suit. People see a woman suing McDonald's for her coffee being too hot, and they laugh at her and say the country is going to hell. What they don't do is read into it, where they'll find out that she [severely burned herself (NSFW)](http://blog.3nips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stella_liebeck_burned_by_mcdonalds_coffee-524x373.jpg) and required expensive medical treatment and had permanent damage to her vagina. Nor do they read about how that particular McDonald's was serving their coffee too hot on purpose so people would take longer to drink it and increase their chances of ordering more food. Nor do they read about how the McDonald's had been warned several times in the past to quit this practice by health and safety authorities.

These, taken together, greatly reinforce the perception of how common ridiculous lawsuits actually are successful. 




 I'll start by saying I understand that just because countries aren't punished for breaking rules doesn't mean the rules are ineffective - they can be preventative. However I'm specifically interested in cases where Country A broke specific rules of warfare and the United Nations (or historical equivalents) enacted a punishment on said country, rather than just a list of ways the UN is effective because of the laws. 




 Source? 




 Pedantic... Replace it with antigay and respond the his post again 




 Ditto, was thinking the same 




 Just wondering what themes I should use when browsing the net at night: light or dark? 









 Take away Mayweather's ability to win on points, it's now a no rules, fight to the death/knockout/surrender. Who wins?

Round 1) Modern day

Round 2) In their prime

It's all fair game - kicking, punching, grabs and throws.

Hopefully you guys aren't sick of the Pac/Mayweather/Tyson threads yet! 




 The first rule is if they are shown dead, they still may come back to life anyway. 




 Awesome idea. Also a balancing nightmare, but if Valve can make him work, I'd love to see him in the game. 




 I don't even eat Nutella! 




 It would last around 21 minutes before Mike Tyson's lung condition started to effect his performance. Just a few Mayweather's could wreck his face then. 




 It's strange to think that there could be a time where you didn't know what you looked like. This isn't really up to the standard of most answers on askhistorians (I'm usually the one asking the questions!), however I mostly wanted to reply to suggest that the average person could probably see their reflection in water in ponds and what not.

Apart from that, I know we have had mirrors throughout most of human history, made of bronze and copper, so some people definitely would have access to a clear reflection of themselves. However I'm unsure if the typical medieval commoner would have had access to them. Which leads to a follow up question of my own: assuming easy access to reflections were not available, would it have been common for towns to have publically available mirrors or reflecting ponds specifically for this purpose? 




 I'm not upset, but I'm definitely disappointed with some of the content that gets upvoted here. But I guess TIL =/= Interesting Facts no matter how much I want it to. 




 TIL that a TV show uses a common writing tool that most TV shows and movies use. Fucking wow. 




 Because you cherrypicked a movie where it wasn't the case. Most zombie movies do actually seem to follow this rule. 




 Hence, Mayweather was the better boxer. 




 Fuck off. 




 for no reason

Because they're bad. Just because something is the same as its source material doesn't automatocally make it good or immune to criticism... 




 But that's a conscious choice. They could have made him less based on Stark. It doesn't make the criticism any less valid 




 He also had a team of writers to fill in for his weaknesses 




 He is just trying to downplay Whedon criticism as being reactionary to his popularity, as if that makes it less valid somehow 




 Bullshit. People have always had this criticism about him, it's just easier to share thanks to the Internet 




 They could have written it so Ultron wasn't based off Tony 




 It's Prime Tyson and he gets a canon of his choice. 

Round 1: any real world canon
Round 2: any canon from fiction
Round 3: can Mayweather clinch him mid air (non fictional canon)

Tyson must survive. 




 6.85 when? 




 I really disagree. May weather and Pac are no slouches. A 2v1 is hard. Lots of room for them to just grapple/wrestle him and wail on his face  




 People tried it against Tyson and still got BTFO 









 People are welcome to express their dissatisfaction with something. If the boxing world doesn't want to change, then fine, no one is forcing it to just as much as those that aren't enjoy boxing in its current state aren't being forced to watch it.

However, if it does want to change, maybe as viewership declines, or simply knowing there is a larger market to tap into, then the feedback is valuable. People are just expressing their views, there is no right or wrong.

Don't like others opinions on boxing? No one is forcing you to read them! 




 Right, and I think people want to see some changes to boxing to make it more interesting to watch.

Most people are admitting Mayweather won fair and square, but they just don't want this to be the way to win. Change may be needed in the sport. 




  I think if someone is a good person at heart (and nice does not always = good, btw), they can never be truly ugly.

Was Hitler ugly? 




  That being said, I'm sure you're lovely. I honestly do not believe that ugly people exist,

This is just condescending and makes what you say sound hollow. Ugly people do exist and they need to learn to cope with it instead of being deluded and thinking they're attractive.

Edit: I don't know why I'm being downvoted. If someone tells me that they think I'm smart, that would fill me with confidence. If they follow that up by saying "I think everybody is smart, including those guys over there who huffed paint fumes every day and can barely remember their own names" then it would make the original compliment have far less meaning. 




 'Support' in this context means continuing to watch and pay money to the industry. 




 There's a tradeoff. Using more strength may score you the same, and seem like a waste, but it deals more damage to the opponent. Some boxes prefer going for points, while others for damage. 




 I don't see why dodging and blocking scores any points...

...? It doesn't. Go look at the punch stats, Mayweather landed more punches than Manny. You can call the sport boring and Mayweather's style is absolutely awful to watch, but at the end of the day he landed more punches. Were we even watching the same fight? 




 Well done. 




 ITT: People who don't know shit about boxing repeat stuff the heard on TV, the internet, from their friends, etc.

How ironic that those people were exactly right. Not just in their prediction of the winner, but how it would play out. Textbook Floyd, I made some easy money off people like you. 




 Logic dictates that being punched in the head for a living isn't healthy.

Only if you make the assumption that being punched in the head is unhealthy to begin with. Personally I think it makes you smarter by exercising your brain more 




 Why? 




 OP doesn't know that. Just because the answer is 'we don't know' doesn't mean it's a bad question. Also people might have written about the masses, like if the characters in a lot of plays from that period where stressed about work it would open some discussion. Diaries aren't necessarily needed 




 Haven't they found evidence of injured early humans being cared for? They can't hunt for themselves, so others helped them. 




 Care to elaborate? 









 Who hasn't Mayweather fought?

Pacquiao. 




 Bruce Lee could easily beat Mike Tyson in a fight. 




 Any source I can find (all of which should be taken with a grain of salt) puts his networth above $100m. This also means he will be doubling his net worth from this fight. 









 The best change Alch got this patch wasn't to Alch himself. It was decreased creep bounty, as Greed is now a larger percentage of gold per creep kill. This aghs thing is an interesting change, but I can only seeing it ever being meaningful in ultra lategame scenarios on a core Alch and if you actually have a gamechanging ult on your team that is still meaningful lategame. It's super niche. 














 Oops. 




 Enjoying titties is degrading?  




 Actually I hate their inclusion in the films. Every enemy Widow or Hawkeye, or even Cap take out is just another enemy that Thor or Hulk would take out with an effortless AoE attack. 

It also makes it harder to have the villain go full force. Any villain that can go hand to hand with Thor should be able to snap Widow in half in a heartbeat. But they don't. So we have to see these characters getting hurt enough to make the villain seem strong but not so badly that they're seriously hurt. It makes the villains seem inconsistent.

Their inclusion just hurts the movies imo. 




 I'm sure he is aware of kryptonite by now 




 Absolutely.

 Being evil isn't the defining quality of being a monster.

Being a monster or a monstrosity by definition refers to extremes though. I'd say a pure evil person is more of a monster than a human being that struggles with moral dilemmas in ever episode. 




 But the term 'monster' itself refers to an extreme to begin with, so I'd say someone who is purely evil to the absolute extreme as is so from birth is still more of a monster than someone who slowly becomes bad/evil (but not quite as evil) over the course of time. 




 It's saying that someone is more evil if they're less evil and gradually become a little evil then someone who is pure evil. It makes no sense because you're either more evil than someone or you aren't, it doesn't matter if you were good to begin with.

Someone who quickly become evil from a young age, perhaps because of upbringing or a traumatic event, is still more evil than a good person who slowly starts to do morally questionable things. 




 Seriously? 




 Lunk alarm? For real? Why have heavy weights at all in the gym? 




 Awesome! Sounds great, how much detail will I get out of the globular clusters? I remember seeing them through a telescope once and it looked amazing.

 Do we know how much money Microsoft made off the Zune? Perhaps they pushed it for four generations in the hopes it would take off, while making barely anything or losing money. Didn't Microsoft only start making money back on entering the console market quite recently?

It could also be considered a failure if their return on investing in the product was far below their goals. 




 simple and concise

But the other answers were simple... and more concise. 




 What did he mean by 'you're not man enough'?

Did the reporter threaten him during the 'inaudible' part and he was saying the reporter wasn't man enough to take him, or was it just a random, empty insult? 




 Careful. He WILL destroy you 




 Title is a bit of a mouthful, so I'll provide an example: I have a gun that holds 20 bullets. I have 200 ammo in reserve. I fire ten bullets. I reload, throwing the old clip/magazine/whatever away. I now have 190 ammo in reserve and 20 in my gun.

Wouldn't it be more realistic and more interesting mechanically to only have 180 left (since I discarded 10 bullets that remained in my gun earlier)? Whenever I play a horror survival or a more realistic styled game I always wish it worked that way. Even for more fast paced multiplayer FPS games I think it would make monitoring ammo and deciding when to reload more interesting.

So... why ISN'T it that way? Seems like it would be the natural default? What started this trend, or has it always been this way? 




 He's wrong. Lee wasn't beaten because he never fought. That is to say he also never won. 




 almost

I can't seem to find ANY tournaments his in. 




 I'm going to voice a bit of a controversial opinion here: but I'll just say he seems to be a good EXHIBITIONIST, not necessarily a good fighter. He showcased his (still incredibly impressive) speed, accuracy, strength and technique in highly controlled environments. A lot of claims about Bruce are more legend than fact.

There are plenty of martial artists that would hand his ass to him on a plate in a real fight. I'm not trying to undermine his accomplishments, he wasn't trying to be a fighter in the first place, so it doesn't matter. I just feel a lot people put him on a pedestal and assume the man must be an unparalleled fighter.

I've heard people say he could beat Mike Tyson (in his prime) in a fight. 




 You're getting downvoted for being obvious of course it's reversed

 For example, work sent me on a training exercise where we learnt things like "You only use 10% of your brain" and some people are "left brained while others are right brained" and basically played a bunch of pre-school tier games that would somehow making us better workers... or something, while my actual work piles up at my desk. 

One quick Google search completely tears the very basis of these training sessions apart. I wish I could remember some of the other pseudo-psychology I've heard, I just remembered those two examples because they're common in the real world too.

I've been to about four like this in just two years, and dozens of employees came alongside me to each. The amount of money lost on labour, travel expenses and to hire these people would be phenomenal.

So why do companies, who are probably finding ways to cut costs everywhere, have such poor quality control for these sorts of events.

My perception about how common this is may just be distorted, but these training sessions have occurred in multiple workplaces for me and my friends have shared similar sentiments. 




 It was non-stop laughs, right?

Not really, but I can see where you're coming from an agree. Perhaps spending so much time interacting with certain communities has affected my perception on what is and isn't 'cringed' at by the broader community. 




 Paraphrasing a reply I made elsewhere in this thread:

"It doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.

I'm really more interested in the thought process of the advertiser rather than whether or not the ad is effective. Are they disconnected, or deliberately producing material that communities will cringe at but remember anyway." 




 True, but on the other side of the coin I barely remembered it and I only saw the ad yesterday and probably won't remember it by next week. I can't think of another example off the top of my head. I guess that's just me though.

At any rate, it doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.

 I disagree. I'd say any more that I get so bored I turn off halfway through qualifies as bad. So that would be Iron Man 3, Captain American 1 and 2 and Thor 2.

Why do I keep seeing these movies...

 Maybe X-Men could be 'stage two' of the Universe one the current actors are done with their run? The Avengers are long since retired/dead, the major threats to Earth dealt with.

 I'm just going to copy and paste my response from that thread:

For me, whether modding or not is good for gaming depends entirely on whose perspective you're referring too.
Obviously, this change is only a benefit to modders. They can still put their products up for free, if they want, or they can look to make a profit (no matter how small it is, it's more than nothing, I don't think "only 25%" is a valid argument).

However, most people complaining about this are complaining about it from the point of view of consumers, not modders. For us, it is bad.

The most probably positive is it will lead to higher quality mods. But honestly, I don't see that happening. People already put a great deal of care and attention into their mods. The marginal increase in quality that paid mods might create is in no way worth the several dollars I will now be charged. And even if the increase in quality is substantial, I think most consumers would prefer hundreds of great mods for free instead of just picking 2-3 paid mods that are of slightly higher quality than usual.

On the opposite side, we're already seeing downside to paid mods ignoring price (issues over ownership, one mod already has in game pop-ups in its free version, issues concerning mods breaking or not interacting together, making them worthless after you buy them, and so on).

I think it's a real stretch to call this immoral, or to say Valve/modders can't or shouldn't want to be paid for their services. However, that's not the question. The question is if there is anything WRONG with it. And I'd say yanking away hours of enjoyment and a strong community built around modding for joy, not money, is seen as wrong by a lot of people.

On a final note, it's one less thing about Steam I liked taken away. The workshop wasn't perfect, but it was convenient (if a mod is on both workshop and Nexus, workshop is a slightly easier install. Now I won't use it at all). So, for me at least, it's making want to purchase games on Steam even less. Anyway, that's my two cents. 




 The modders can make their own site and sell it. But they'd probably make less money than selling it through Steam with a 100% cut on their own website.

They're not paying for the hosting costs or effort on Valve's part. The paying for being in a highly visible (and therefore highly valuable) location. Anyway, I think the 25% cut is the LEAST important part of this debate. It's a number and it can change.

The more important issue is how this will affect the quality or mods and the value of games that are highly dependent on mods.

 I suppose the same might be said of other villains in the franchise, but as far as I can recall they all had plans that at some point required them to make a big scene. 




 So... Ultron could have easily won if he just didn't make his presence know to the Avengers, right?

The only times he had to make his presence known for his plans to work was when he first encountering Jarvis. But he could have killed Jarvis, escaped though the Internet and laid low. Stark wouldn't have been able to work out the AI came alive, just that it caused a huge issue with his network.

He could have built his robot army/meteor machine in private, unknown to the rest of the world. Once the thing went into motion, it is unlikely the Avengers could work out what was happening in time.

But what about the twins? Or becoming known to the scientists who he tricked into building him his new body?

He wouldn't need either of these things if the Avengers weren't after him in the first place.

TL;DR: Ultron dun goofed. 




 I disagree. Enough bullets fired in Bane's direction, eventually one will hit. 




 This. I could have a decade of training, I'm not going to beat modern day Mike Tyson, let alone Prime Tyson. The only answer is 'no one', since I don't want to spend my last year alive training. 




 mostly jokingly, that there are other factors in being attractive than having a big dick or broad shoulders.

I think most people would rather date a 7/10 personality than a 7/10 looks than a 10/10 personality and 5/10 looks. For a lot of people for already have nice personalities, their bodies are probably the area they need to work on most.

 uTorrent recently experienced some severe backlash after including malware in one of its updates. I suspect this downgrade possibly has something to do with that (why they don't just release an update that has it removed is another question). 




 It's really not that hard to follow to be honest. There might be lots of movies, but they're still quite simplistic movies. 




 I fail to see how that's relevant to what he's said. I've seen them all in order and I still agree with him. They're just bad movies, but the hype train won't end as long as there are fans to eat it up. 




 Well what were you expecting from capeshit? 









 It also costs a fortune. There's no real reason to buy it yet. If you haven't got any Civ games, you're best off getting Civ V + all expansions for less than BE. They need to make some fantastic expansions to make that game worth buying. 









 Yeah, but the question is can you do it with a transporter.  









 In the TNG episode "Relics", Scotty and his friend (Franklin? Let's call him Franklin) where trapped inside transport buffers. Scotty's pattern was saved, but his friend's was lost forever.

So, it's possible to eliminate a pattern to prevent re-assembly of Superman. 




 Who is operating it would be a factor.

What's Data's fastest feat in terms of hand/eye cordination? Perhaps he could pull it off?

If we really want to cheat we could have Q man the machine and use his wizard powers to time it perfectly, and it's just a matter of pressing the buttons as a formality. 









 Followup question (if that's OK on this subreddit, trying to save myself making a new thread): Did the treatment of the Jewish people improve much immediately following the war? Would it be a far argument to say Hitler's extreme treatment of the Jews could have had the effect of improving popular opinion of them in the long run? 









 hahahahaha OP that meme is dank!! BAZINGA! 




 I can't say I'm surprised by a billionaire wanting even more money, but I kind of see where OP is coming from. To my knowledge, Valve wasn't started to be like your typical company. It was a guy who loved videogames wanting to make videogames.

If I were a billionaire, every extra dollar would seem marginally less appealing. Eventually, I'd care more about pleasing my fans (and stroking my massive ego to my own circle jerk) than making any more money. OK, maybe that tune would change if I actually were a billionaire, but at the moment I guess the idea of having that much money is so alien to me I just can't imagine why you'd NEED any more - especially at the expense of your own fans and your own 'child' (Valve). 




 People realise this. It still has potential to effect people that don't use the Steam workshop. If a person wants to sell their mod, they can remove it from all sources except the Steam workshop. 




 Interested in knowing this too. 




 I'll play Devil's Advocate here: were you banned for copy + pasting a comment? Perhaps it's just an automated filter. 




 While many fans were expecting the surprise announcement Valve had been hyping this week to be news about the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, Valve fanboys were still pleased when Valve instead showed off their latest product: Valve possession vans. Currently being tested in the United States, these vans will repossessing your personal goods and belongings in exchange for money owed for mandatory mods, Valve updates and Valve Gold Subscriptions. The vans are expected for a worldwide launch next year. 









 "who the fuck thought this was a good idea".

Considering Sandler's box office pull, I'm guessing the answer is "people who like money". 




 You're right, I was completely wrong on the details. Men seem to cost more as their accidents are expensive. Same principle, swap genders and ignore the part about men's accidents tending to not pay out. 




 Watch from 0:42 seconds onwards in OPs video. You see the guy jump on his car (coinciding with about 1:16 in the video you linked).

You can see he is completely blocked by traffic 'stage left'. [Here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Jv37wtR.png) (the traffic is clearer if you watch the video though).

In fact, I would not be surprised if this exact angle is exactly what the Defense Attorney was discussing in this quote here:
"When we saw the first video **[I believe he is referring to the one you linked]**, it could have been interpreted in a different way, but after looking at other videos **[this is referring to OPs video, which was considered vital to getting a proper interpretation of events]** and putting it all together, I think we must be careful not to take a decision too quickly," Vaillancourt said."
