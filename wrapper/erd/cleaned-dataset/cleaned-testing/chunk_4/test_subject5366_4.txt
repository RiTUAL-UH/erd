 It depends?  
Action combat can be fun, but it can also get repetitive, tiring, and boring as well. I suppose if combat is as dangerous as it sounds, you may not be fighting something/someone every few minutes during your gameplay, mitigating some of the cons.  
Personally I miss the pre-teamspeak days, where combat was slower,  you actually typed commands to your teammates, and allowed for more strategy rather than the current 'maximize button presses per minute, dodge when you see a swing' tactic to overcome your foes.
