 [Nope. It was 'shooped for a Nokia comercial](http://www.snopes.com/photos/advertisements/pingpong.asp) 



















 If this is a run and gun disaster, I'm fucked. I'm at work right now, and in my pockets are two sets of keys, one small knife, a pack of smokes, a lighter, a wee bit of smoke, a wallet with about 35 bucks, and a pen.

The only useful things on my person right now would be my lighter, my small knife, and my shoelaces. I don't know how long I could last with those.

If this was a hunker down kind of scenario though, I'd be in pretty good shape. I work in a restaurant that cooks with a wood fire. Plenty of food, the ability to cook most of it off if the power fails, access to knives, fresh water, and supplies like a well stocked first aid kit. Not a bad place to be if things went to hell. 














 After recognizing some serious errors in my game (lack of backhand, lack of distance, etc.) I dumbed down my bag as well.

* 3 Champ Beast
* 2 Champ Shark
* MVP Amp
* Lat 64 River
* 2 MVP Anodes

Super improvement once I gave myself over to understanding what I should be able to do with my discs and letting myself get to the point where I could do those things.

Easily breaking the 300' wall with my Beasts now, reliable upshots with my Sharks, putting well from 30' with the Anodes. Got some room to add a few things, thinking about switching in a Shark3, and I want to test throw a blizzard Beast a couple times before I add that in to the mix as well. 

I recommended it my club, and scores have been improving everywhere. I highly recommend it. Tourney bags, and tourney amount of discs, are for tourney pros, not us ams.

 I can't speak about events I haven't been too, but the one's that I have been too are about fun, and community, and beer, and bbq, and discgolf. We had a couple of real new guys in our group, and we didn't care; we spent time working on their form and talking about the game instead. 

If you're thinking about doing it, do it. You won't regret it. They're fun. 




 Nope. Amateur event.

Depending on event, you are supplied discs, and it's one shot and done. If you get an ace, you score one point, if you don't, you don't.

Most points at the end win.

Google DiscCraft AceRace for more information. 




 No, just old person shaped. Would've been better if she was huge, right? 




 It did cross my mind.... 




 Right? I even told her that after everything got chilled out. Their good, but take your time, you can always bring some home!
 




 You would think so, but our standard customer might be aware that the internet exists, but that's about it. Old people, they smell funny, and don't chew their food, apparently. 




 I was walking food to the table next to them. She was getting up, and wheezing hard. I heard it, and went over to check on her, and right as I got to her she inhaled and I heard it block. She didn't do the traditional hands to the neck sign, but at that point you could see the panic. After her throat cleared, she was wheezing hard and claiming to still be choking, but after talking her down and getting her calm, she was alright.

Fukin' pork chops. They're good, but slow down! 




 Heimlich maneuver. Know it. You might need it.


Old lady out in FOH, chokes on a too-big piece of pork chop. Fully choking, customers standing around like dull eyed cattle. Jump in, three thrusts, out shoots the chop, everybody's happy. 














 As in using it as a poaching liquid? Absolutely safe. Right way to go about there. 




 No, not the meat (other than different bacteria or microbes to deal with)

The marinade itself can be made safe with application of heat over a period of time. But before heating, contact with marinade with kitchen implements, hands, spills on counter, etc are all dangers.

EX: You use a spoon to stir the marinade, and lay it on a counter. You cook the marinade, at temp, over time, and make it safe. You sit it aside as you plate your food, and then use that same spoon to dish the marinade/sauce. You have now re-introduced bacteria and microbes into your food.

This is a danger in all cooking, the difference here is that the marinade allows the bacteria to grow quickly, so you have a higher concentration of bacteria/microbes to deal with, making any accidental cross contamination possibly dangerous. 




 The danger here is that even under refrigeration, the microbes will continue to reproduce. Like I said, safe if heated correctly, but dangerous because of the introduction of liquid media. 

The chicken has the slamminella naturally. As the bird is butchered, it gets spread about. Under refrigeration the salmonella will continue to reproduce, slowly, but mostly on the surface. When introduced into a liquid, you've given them room, and energy (food), and invited them to turn it up a notch.

It will still grow slowly under refrigeration, but it will still grow.

You can do it, but the danger here is cross contamination. A dirty spoon, a dirty knife, your hands, anything that comes in contact with the marinade that isn't heated or sanitized is going to allow that growth to continue, and it don't take long at room temp for a problem to develop. Now you use that knife, or spoon, or hand, and reintroduce bacteria and microbes onto your food.

Can be done, just have to be super safe, and super conscious of what you're doing to ensure safety. 




 Food science, here we go!

The reason that we are told to discard marinades is because of the danger of bacteria/microbial growth. Bacteria/microbes in our food=bad.

When you put chicken in the marinade, you're also (probably, likely really) putting salmonella in that marinade.

Now your marinade is a microbial bacteria soup ready to spring into death-bringing action, as long as a couple of things fall in place.

If your marinade sits out at room temp for any length of time, it's like the bacteria's parents have gone away for a long weekend and they've called everyone and let them know that it's bacteria party time, and the bacteria are all up in the parents room dividing and shit, microbes and bacteria partying together, replicating and reproducing. This is super bad. (This really starts happening just as soon as you put the chicken in the marinade, keep that in mind.)

If you marinate your birdmeat in the fridge, keeping the temp below 40 deg F you can slow down the rate of growth. It's like the bacteria are nerds, and only invite a few microbe friends over for some Minecraft action, and a couple of them get lucky and boom! Bacteria babies. They still grow, just slower.

How can you put a stop to this madness; this bacteria baccanalia, this mass production of microbes? Heat baby. If you heat anything up to at least 165 deg F for at least 4 minutes, you're gonna kill *most* bacteria/microbes in whatever you're cooking. *Most*.

So, with the question of marinades, if you have kept the marinade cold, and are using it directly after marinating, and you haven't let it sit for more than four hours, and you heat the shit outta of it, then you should be okay, but it's still a little bit risky. If you marinated at room temp, or longer than four hours, you have allowed the bacteria party to go on way to long, and when you apply heat to it, you're going to kill most, but not all. Most bacteria/microbes to begin with=more bacteriamicrobes after bringing the heat death. 

Personally, I have used the marinade after marinating it, but only rarely, and only in applications where I know that I can heat the shit out of it as part of the cooking process. (Now I make the marinade, and reserve some to the side if I want to start a sauce or something.)

As far as using the marinade as a poaching liquid...I've never tried it, if you bring it to a rolling boil for a few minutes and then reduce heat to simmering, you technically should be okay, but there is a great opportunity to screw up. (Cross contamination!)

As far as the poaching liquid alone goes, go for it! Simmering happens just below true boiling, a temperature that is on the other side of that safety barrier of 165 deg F, so as long as you don't abuse the juice (by leaving it at room temp for too long in between uses, or cross contaminating the pan or some such), totally safe to use in a sauce.  

Safety first. I say no go on the marinade, just too risky. Technically safe, but the window for fuckin' up is just too big. Poaching juice, do it. Safely.

Enjoy! Happy cooking!

 Sorry for your loss, and well said. We do our duty as citizens when we point out the failings of our public servants, and when we point out laws that are unjust, or are levied on people unfairly, but we fail at our duty when we take every man and woman in blue and paint them with the same guilty brush.

I've known both sides of this. I personally know a small town sheriff who is the most racist, bigoted, small minded, damn near evil man I've ever met. On the other hand, I've seen officers do kindnesses for no other reason to be kind, and they bring honor to their badges.

 [Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman (Hebrew name     [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])[1][2] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota,[3][4] and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range west of Lake Superior. His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.[5] His maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.[5] In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from Kazman in north eastern Turkey.[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)
 




 Hmmm, funny. I never knew Bob Dylan was hispanic. 




 Personal opinion from (M40):

Texting is casual, calling is formal.

Text her and tell her that you'll be somewhere, and ask if she wants to be there too. Not a date, a meetup.

Use said meetup to ask for date.

Next date you ask for, use the phone.

Be a gentleman, get rewarded. 




 Hard to say with just this information.

Cookies are falling apart. Why?

Cookies fall apart because they are soft and gooey? Check the temp of your oven. Check your cooking times. With the addition of peanut butter to this recipe, there may be too much fat, or possibly to much water. Try refrigerating your dough before cooking. Maybe even as simple as smaller cookies might solve the problem.

Cookies fall apart because they are dry and sandy? Try removing one or both egg whites. Try changing flour. Recipe just says "flour". I use AP flour, bread flour, oatmeal flour, and winter flour, and combinations of these to get the consistency of cookie that I want.

Without more info to pinpoint problems, and without making them myself (I'm making burnt butter brown sugar prints today) I recommend reading [this post](http://bakerbettie.com/the-science-of-the-chocolate-chip-cookie/) about the science of cookie ingredients. Happy baking! 
































































 Hmm....probably the FCS Stetson Hatters....a local college here in my area that hasn't had a football program since 1929...and are starting up again this [season](http://www.gohatters.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=14600 SPID=88895 SPSID=621048). Big things for Big Green! GO HATS!! 



















 Some jobs are hired with a salary range, not a set salary, but that's not really what it's about.

Knowing a ballpark figure of your own worth shows self confidence, but it can also show a complete lack of knowledge about the job your applying for. A CPA might be worth 65k a year, but not as a fry cook.

Knowing what the ballpark for the job you're applying for means that you've done your homework. You've researched the job. It means that your serious, you're not just doing the legwork and hoping for the best. And, additionally, to a small degree, it shows a bit about your character.

EX: If you're applying for a mid-level management position with a banking company, you do you research, you know what people in that city are making for that job, you know how the company is set financially, and you walk in knowing that the position being filled starts at 30k - 40k. When the interviewer asks you how much you expect to make, and you with no experience, just out of school, young, ask for 41k, we know you don't know what you're talking about. Inversely, if you have lots of experience in the job being offered and you low ball yourself, there are going to be questions about your self confidence.

Shoot for the middle, unless you are absolutely sure you are the most qualified applicant for the job. In that case, go high. 





























 Hmmm....Siracha. Garlic. Honey. I can a lot with those things.

Or...Cilantro. Dry Ranch Powder. Cinnamon. Some fun things there.

Or...Vodka. Whiskey. Beer. Drink the beer, hand out shots of whiskey, and use the vodka to start a fire. You won't win, but they won't forget you! 




 Complimentary harmonic vibrations. The 12th fret is the octave from the open string...when you release the note, the vibrations easily translate from the 12th fretted note to the open note. It happens with other fretted notes as well, but because they aren't directly complimentary, the vibrations either effectively cancel each other out or vibrate at levels we can't quite hear.

 












































 You gotta have someone you can trust, I give you that. 




 I think that just like a man has a "best man" at a wedding, he should have a "last man" at a funeral.

As soon as your friend gets news that you have died, his job is to confiscate all of your embarrassments, to collect them, to destroy the things that should be destroyed, and to save those things that should be saved. 

Come get the computer, that box at the top of the closet, that other box beneath the bed. Wipe the hard drive, and don't forget the secret files on my workplace PC as well as my memory sticks. Save the photos that matter from my digital devices, and then destroy the evidence. Go out clean.

I already know who I am going to ask to do this for me. 














 Have you not been to Daytona before? Living downtown would be terrible, unless you truly enjoy all the nonsense going ons that happen every other weekend there. 

Daytona is the larger city, and it has its goods, but I personally don't care for it. Much of Daytona is a little rough, and the parts that arent' are expensive.

Go, check it out, talk to some locals, but as long as the bigger city issue isnt a dealbreaker for you, I recommend checking some of the outlying areas. South to New Smyrna Beach, and north to Ormond Beach. Lots of very cool seaside towns (lots of old people though) and most of the places are very ped/bike friendly. And, Daytona is right up/down the road when you need the Daytona experience.

Just my opinion, I live down New Smyrna, and I love it. Very touristy, lots of old folks, but there is so much good here it makes up for it. Prices are right too. I rent my place, across the street from the beach, 3/2.5 for 1K month. I walk/ride my bike to work/grocery store/bars/kids school. Got friends that live in other smaller towns along this strip of Volusia county (Port Orange and Ormond) and they say the same things about their towns.

Enjoy the trip, get to the beach, have fun, and good luck. 




 I used to, but I developed some habits to help me with that. Someone else mentioned a checklist, and I'm thinking I don't want to walk out doing paperwork; I'm sure I've done enough of that for the day. 

I sat down and wrote out my "closing walk". (Saved it for training incoming supervisors, too). I made sure that I covered every detail; lights, AC, TV's, alarms, locks, everything. I did it in order, and I make sure that I do it the same way, every night, every time. 

Now I don't have to think about it. I don't read my list. I just do the same thing every night, including little things like when I lock the front door, I put the keys in the opposite pocket of where they usually reside. 

Doing it the same way every time, combined with little clues like the key trick (I also say "OFF" out loud every time I check that something is off, little things like that) I never have to worry about it. Every now and again, I will doubt myself, but I can just tell myself, I've done it the same way a hundred times, I know I didn't forget anything, and I haven't in a long time. 



















 I can grow/tend crops.

I'm a pretty decent carpenter.

I'm a professional chef, and know food, and food safety. I know canning, preserving, salting and dehydrating food.

I can shoot, both gun and bow.

I can fish. I can trap.

And like a whole lot of Redditmen, I have thought about this scenario way too much, and I feel like I am fairly prepared, both in the beginning, in survival, and in rebuilding.

I am also a natural leader and love to teach, and would be great with a small group, not so much with larger groups.

Perfect scenario for me would be a small band of survivors with a stronghold. I could reinforce the stronghold, I could grow crops, I could protect the stronghold, I could lay up food for the leaner times, and in down times I could share my knowledge with others. 




 Not a bad theory, but I don't know if it fits the canon...have you read the Stand yet? Both early and late in the book it talks a little bit about Flagg, and how long he's been around. Stilson may be one instance of Flagg, but certainly not the first.

IMO, I think that Stilson fits more into the ideas talked about in Insomnia...that people serve the White, the Red, or the Random. Where Stilson fits, either Red or Random could be a lively debate. 



















 I'll start, but with the opposing view.

I'm a diehard Gator fan, have been my whole life, but I lived and worked in Tallahassee, home of the Seminoles, for almost a decade.

I loved it there. Great fans, great tailgating, plenty of ribbing for being a Gator, but I was always made to feel welcome, always had a beer for me at the parties, and I always had a good time.

Inversely, I've seen how our Gator fans treat visitors, and if the shoe was on the other foot, I don't feel that I would be as comfortable in Gainesville being a fan of whoever they were playing as I was made to feel as a Gator in Seminole Country.

If I had to complain about anything about the Seminole Nation, I would point out that their students didn't stay for whole games. Far too in a hurry to get to the parties/the bars. Saw the student section empty out game after game when I was there. But the parties were pretty f'in epic. 



















 I regret many things that I did, and have no wish to share them here. But I also recognize that each time I did something that I shouldn't have, I learned a very important lesson, and each and every one of those lessons helped me become who I am, and I am happy with that.

I regret nothing, while I am shamed by much of what I have done. 




 I though you were gonna say scratched up and broken in.
 




 I have had a little trouble with this as well. From my studies, I get

1. The difference is between the verbs estar (to be) and ser (to be). Estar is a transitive state of to be, while ser is a permanent state of to be. If you are studying, that's not something you are always doing, so "estoy estudiando" whereas if you are American, "soy americano" because that is something that you always are. The difference in the two party statements seems to be that the wording of "where is the party at?" implies that there is a party going on somewhere that won't be there forever, while "where is the party" has more permanence. It's pretty advanced grammar for so early in Memrise. (Side note: If you're using Memrise, use Duolingo.com as well, they support each other well.)

2. The simple difference is in the state of doing. "Tengo que" (I have to) is something that you feel you have to do, while "Debo de" is something you must do, because of outside forces. "Tengo que ir al bano" I have to go to the bathroom *because I have to pee*, vs Debo de ir a la catedral" I must go to the cathedral *because my mom told me too*. 

Better speakers than me please correct if wrong, but that's what I get from my reading. 




 The earliest advent of progressive forms in English came from Latin translations. In languages without a lot progressive forms, like Spanish and French, a simple verb-phrase like "I eat" could mean several different things: I eat now, I eat regularly, I eat today, etc. Latin has different verb forms for all those statements, and languages without that verb structure had to append adjectives to describe the same idea. (Spanish "I eat" is "Yo como", I eat now is "Hoy como" or "Yo como ahora", etc) So in translating the Latin, English took the route of appending verbs to a progressive form, to easily translate the Latin ideas.

[Here's a quite wordy article about some of this](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-lamont)

As for the increasing usage of progressive forms, I think they gain popularity becuase they are brief compared to fully explaining your meaning, and English, specifically American English, is lazy.
 





























 These would also work on Catholics, but you'd have to shoot them on Friday. 




 There are many rules.

"You can wear a pink shirt. You can have a pony tail. You can have piercings. But you shouldn't have all three." ~ Willie Nelson

The dude in the pink shirt with confidence, drinking beer is more manly than the uncomfortable blue shirted guy drinking wine, but if the pink shirt guy starts drinking wine, there are too many conflicting images. Imagine instead the burly lumberjack walking into the bar, setting down his axe, sauntering over to the bar, and ordering a glass of merlot. That works. It's better if he orders a bucket of wine, but still a glass is good.

Additionally, beer has traditionally been for the masses, while wine was enjoyed by the elite and the artistic. More bonuses.  




 A fair question.

Perhaps an argument that between classes you could make judgements of manliness...a passion fruit wine cooler is definitely less manly than a quality import beer, but overall, beer is less manly than wine.

All men drink beer. It's a given.

To be a man, you must have confidence, and presence.

Bustng out some red wine at a beer party, as long as you drink it from a paper or plastic cup, shows that you are apart from the herd, that you stand out, that you are your own man, and you follow your own rules.

But mostly, wine gets you hammered quicker and harder than beer, hence manly. Plus, technicolor vomit is a plus.

 For sure!

1. Home Depot has everything I need in one place, while Lowe's is spread about a bit more.

2. The people that shop at Lowes are far more likely to be able to id me, while Home Depot has plenty of drunks and illegal aliens, neither of which want to rock the boat!

3. Home Depot is just closer. 




 Me, I like [this guy](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-D-Grip-Steel-Square-Point-Shovel-1594300/202562612#.UcjbU5yWl4M) right here. Nice square nose for quick digging and even sides, and can transfer a fair amount of material in a hurry, which can be important in this kind of project.

I never worry about disturbing the surface with this guy. I like to pick a place that's not so well traveled, and covered with ground litter....whether tree leaves, dead grass, or even trash that gets blown in to the area, this shovel allows me to get in, get dug, and get out. Kick the ground cover around, and it's like I was never there!

As far as rope or duct tape, I don't use either in any project murder hole, so I'll answer your question two ways.

One: For transfering the product to the murder hole. I like whatever is handy. I try to grab something ahead of time, but sometimes it's sort of a random unexpected thing, so i'll just use whatever is handy. Carpet, old tarp, trash bags, hell, there was this one time I had to use plastic wrap!

Two: For binding. Nothing beats rope. It really gives the feel of "oh shit, this guy is fuckin nuts! He's gonna eat my liver" to any proceedings. I keep some duct tape around, just for gagging or covering the airways completely, but I'm a rope guy! Try [this stuff here,](http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/203837266?productId=203837266 storeId=10051 langId=-1 catalogId=10053 MERCH=REC-_-SearchPLPHorizontal1-1-_-NA-_-203837266-_-N#.UcjcsJyWl4M) it really gives the scratchy ropy feel that you want, the kind that brings the real terror when they regain consciousness!

Hope that helps, and good luck. Have fun! 




 Several organizations that represent the Disabled recommend against this sort of idea.

How to treat people with disabilities is just that....treating **people** *with* disabilities.

The people-first idea of disability etiquette states that you should first always remember that it is a person with a disability, not a disabled person. (Not a blind person, but a person, with blindness).

Changing language may seem like a good idea, but can be insulting to those with disabilities. 

That sort of thing is acceptable among close friends, but in general, stay away from special language that points out disability in others.

 














 Stop using them. Those cloth reuseable bags are like a buck apiece. Buy one, each time you go shopping, and you'll have plenty in no time. Get plastic bags every now and again to use for mini trash bags, but get away from them.

Makes no sense to use bags made of petroleum products that took millions of years to create, but you're done with in less than an hour. 




 Because it makes good TV.

I don't watch the show, I'm a dedicated TV hater, but I checked out a couple of episodes back when Danny Veltri was on. He worked at a restaurant that was next door to the place that I worked, local hometown hero and such. 

I watched one episode in full. The job that day was to make some sort of fancy salad. 

I've worked in the food industry for a long time, and what I got from watching that particular episode, is that for all the money spent on that show, it is one of the worst kitchens ever set up. Here the contestants/cooks were having to run around from station to station to find all the ingredients that they needed for these salads, while Ramsay screamed at all of them for being retarded donkeys, and the only thing I could think of is why on earth would you have to go to more than one place to make a dish? What kind of set-up are these people working in? Ergonomics, flow-through, and mise-en-place were ignored in favor of making these people go four different places for four different kinds of lettuce while Ramsay got to call them all idiots.

The only thing that I took away from that episode was that the idiots were the people that thought this approximates a real kitchen in any way, or represents how things work in a professional kitchen. It may make good TV, but it certainly didn't make good chefs out of these people...Danny Veltri won, worked at Ramsay's place for what, 8 months? Got fired, tried to open some new place here in town, failed, and went and got himself locked up for DUI for driving will fucked on pills. 

It's TV, and like all TV, it doesn't represent reality.

 
























 If you're going to pump out conspiracy theories at least do your homework.

President Obama is black. Sort of.

Michelle Obama is black.

Kim Kardashian is white.

Kanye West is black. (Did you know that?) He's also a douche, but I don't think that matters.

So, here's your title.

US government contracts media outlets to push stories about Kim Kardashian's mixed baby in an effort to get Americans to accept future race mixing.

White American is becoming a minority, but I don't think that there's some cabal of old white men pushing stories about a mixed baby in order to preserve white america. 




 I'm not gonna cross off an easy win off our list yet....yet.
 














 Find gear online. Check locally, there might be local shop, but that depends on the scene around your disc golf course.

I like [primediscs.com](https://www.primediscs.com/), and [marshallstreet](http://www.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/), and [discgolfstore.com](http://www.discgolfstore.com/), but that's just like, my opinion, man. 




 Discs can be a pretty personal thing. If she's gotten into the game at all she may be quite picky about what plastic she will throw.

As far as discs go, if you're going that route without knowing what she's into, sneak a peek in the bag and she what kind of discs she has already, and get the upgraded level. (EX: Innova bottom line plastic is DX, she has a DX Beast, get her a Champion or Star Beast; same disc, better plastic)

Out side of that, accessories will be the easiest. A new bag is always a welcome addition. (I keep growing out of my bag, got a bit of disc collecting problem) I think someone mentioned a practice basket; that would be an epic present for someone starting out. 

Nowhere near as cool, but giftcards to a discseller might be an option as well.

And go out there and play, it's fun!

 Haven't made them yet, just ran across them this morning...but I do my baking on the weekend, so giving it some thought...but I just can't do all the premade crap, gotta go scratch!
 




 I thought about doing a bar cookie and then topping with creme brulee, but once cut into bars, it would go all mushy. Gonna have to go with mini muffin cups, and press sugar cookie dough into little bowl shapes...thought I may try a shortbread crust as well. 




 She is alive and well in my SO's imagination. 




 What a great idea! I can't see how this could possibly be abused by anyone! Sign me up! 




 I think my brain broke. But not the most difficult thing I ever masturbated to.  




 Dude is straight-up eye-fucking the camera while working that chicken leg...that's bad enough, but it's the shirt that tells you "I'm saving you in the spank-bank for a later withdrawl." 




 Your daughter needs love and attention and cuddling and nurturing.

But you know what else she needs?

Diapers, food, a roof over her head, shots, doctors visits, immunizations, clothes, toys to help her learn, more diapers, more food, and about a billion other things that cost money.

What you're doing is hard. It's hard work, it's hard on you, and it's hard on your family. But if this is what you two have decided is the balance of labor, then you have to stop feeling guilty. You are helping when you can, and the time that you are not at home is not time *not* helping, it's just helping in a different way.

IMO, I don't think mama is being very fair here. If she's giving you hell because you are not there through the hard times she's having, it's because she's not recognizing how hard it is for you to get up and leave your family every morning to go make the money that gives the both of you the ability to create this family.

There is the possibility of some form of post partum depression here, but overall I think mom is feeling overwhelmed (just from what you described) and I think she's taking it out on you. 

You need to talk. This could get a lot worse, and if things are the way you describe them, you can't change things. You have to work. She has to care for the baby. Time to sit down and work this out, and if you can't, it's counseling time.

This is a serious issue, and if you have a good support network (parents/church/friends/etc) maybe get them involved, but stop feeling guilty for doing what you have to do. It's not healthy for you, and not healthy for baby. 



















 Still haven't pulled the trigger on the 3....I've already got 3 Sharks in the bag, I'd have to give something else up to pop it in there. River? Amp? Hmmm, maybe my Zombeee? 




 Now I don't feel so lonely. 

I love the Shark. I putted with the Shark exclusively for the first five years I played. I still use the Shark on iffy puts from outside my comfort zone, but am slowly transitioning to Anodes. 

My game has gotten better since weaning myself off of my Shark addiction (still my go to fairway and upshot choice) but while I can sink the long ones now with the Anodes, I still pull off a minor miracle every now and again and ring the chains from distance with the Shark. 

Good on you, fellow Sharker, go with what works, and ignore the hivemind...but don't let habit get in your way of making improvements, either.  









 I don't know how it would work in hilly terrain; I don't play on hills, but I put an air bounce shot towards a short basket. Throw nose up with a straight putter that won't fade, and as it gives up its energy, it will float down almost vertical, with just a light fade. Got a hole on my home course that I use that shot on often, and I can't chain it that way, I guarantee the bird. 




 I had a very similar power problem on approach shots for quite a long time....75' to 100' feet out, should be able to plop it right next to the basket, and I would sit 20' or 30' out from it.

A local on my home course said he dealt with the same problem, and approaches it two ways.

One, if the shot is clear, he overpowers and takes a big hyzer line, arcing into place into of a straight shot. (It took a while to practice it, but I can do that with some finesse now)

Two, if a straight approach is necessary, target a tree/bush/garbage can/random junkie that's about 20-30'+ *past* the basket (that's the distance I was having trouble with) and try to shoot *through* the basket to the target beyond it. Improved my approach game quickly, and now it's automatic for me on upshots; can plop 'em down with little trouble. I applied that same thinking to a lot of my longer putts and have been sinking 'em from farther out, too. 









 The dollar store may be your friend, but the internet may save your life. Save up some money, get a pre-loaded Visa gift card (or equivalent) and visit an on-line sex shop and purchase something safe! Not everything laying about your house is safe to go jammin up yer bum. 

You mentioned your sister, and I have no idea why, because I don't think that she would fit up there. 




 If you're worried about them, you're not going to be able to stop thinking about them, so use that energy and apply it to something else. 

Work on some sort of crafty thing that you think will make them happy. A homemade card, a photo collage, a custom made get well gift. Write a short story about them as a superhero. 

Doesn't really matter what, whatever art it is that you do/have, use that energy in a positive way to influence that art/craft, plus you have a great gift to share when that loved one/family member returns home!

 Cool. But be advised that the direct translation there is someone who has sex with food. 




 It has worked for me, a bunch.

It's not the food as much as commanding a kitchen. Showing competence and confidence while performing a task.

It's a show, and I put on a good one. 

And I call myself a gastrosexual. (CTGL, go ahead and use that one) 




 [Tilt out trash cabinet](http://ana-white.com/2011/04/wood-tilt-out-trash-or-recycling-cabinet) from Ana white. 




 My youngest is fivealmostsix (that's how she says it) and what amazes me is how quickly you forget about how small they are. He's definitely got baby fever with one so young, but a gift that will keep those memories would be something I personally would enjoy.

Got plenty of pictures, but things like audio recordings, or hand/feet prints, even clothes to help him remember what she was like was she was tiny.

And some kind of sexytime for Dad. Don't forget that.
