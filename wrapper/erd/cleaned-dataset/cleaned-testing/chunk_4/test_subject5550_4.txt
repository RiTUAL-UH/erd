  (rich whites) do have the power to continue to suppress the economic mobility of poor people

But basketball players!!!11!!! MURICAN DREAM!![Insert additional anecdotes that belie statistics to support the bullshit idea that there is a ladder to financial success in this country in line with American exceptional-ism] 




 It's not "an internal affair" - it's being covered by media outlets all over the world. Some foreign media outlets have been covering it extensively and even sent correspondents (some of whom were arrested by American policy) to further investigate. When authorities in your country appear to be doing ridiculous things and the world is interested - its no longer an 'internal affair' - this is not some liqour store robbery... 




 So, basically, all the facts were true, but the conclusion that should be drawn is not as simplistic as the one he offered?

By analogy, OP reads "80% of blacks more likely to flunk out of school due to socio-economic conditions and disparity in public education quality in less affluent neighborhoods that are predominantly non-white. It's not because of race or inherent cultural differences, but directly casual to poverty" and then begins to post all over reddit "blacks inherently stupid, nigger stupidity irreversible - 80% blackies flunk - see link. This is science inb4 stormfront, racist"

Yes, the fact is true, but the fact itself is drawn from a study written to dispel the exact conclusion OP was coming to. OP is citing facts from a source, and interpolating the **exact** conclusions the study is arguing against. Hopefully that helps... 




 There's a lot more fucked than just the electoral college when it comes to systemic problems.

 Because at the time of his death, all we had to go on was the police fabrication that he was threatening the cops with his fake sword. You can't raise fuck-all with a story like that. As for Mike, outside of the Fox News watching half of the country, the fact that somebody stole some cigars and was than gunned down cold in an unrelated shooting certainly isn't controversial - let alone that being a crook isn't a good reason to get gunned down. 




 Killed someone? Lied about the situation leading up to it? How is this not a murder one?

Because the gov prosecutor is supposed to bring criminal charges - they can't be brought by third parties. Since a branch of government has a monopoly over the pursuit of such cases, and the envisioned separation of government into multiple parts has become an effective facade in modern times, no charges can or will ever be brought. Unless the prosecutor has a grudge with a particular cop. 




 I think what we're saying is that if the opportunity presented itself, we would loot the pharmacy. That's it, that's all.

That's exactly what I described you as: **Opportunistic** worthless criminals, exploiting the death of a kid and potential abuse of authority by cops to get your fix 




 Totally. Ferguson and ISIS led to this. The amount of baseless speculation in the 'news' is getting ridiculous. 




 Typical opiate troll, this bumps for you.

Oh - I don't mind at all. If it wasn't for junkies like you, I would've never got out the shit hole to the suburbs...

I'm just commenting on how you guys play to stereotypes in this sub so well. Opportunistic worthless criminals, exploiting the death of a kid and potential abuse of authority by cops to get your fix (at least in your imagination). I love it. 




 Darren Wilson was not acquitted of murder. The Grand Jury doesn't rule on innocence or guilt. They ruled that it wasn't even worth charging him and allowing the judicial system to determine innocence or guilt. False Analogy. 




 I know the first place I would hit would be the pharmacies. I would have so many pills, I would be set for a good minute. Anyone else thinking they would do this if they had an opportunity like this?


Junkies living up to popular perception - nice! 




 Can you show a comparison of the money "in huge amounts" for ea side? 




 Instead - the cops picked up the rocks that were thrown by the kids. This is not gonna end well. Cameras - from guys who were taking photos and videos coming in from the police side, quickly turn away. 




 For added sadness, read Reddit usernames, amirite /u/HitlerWasASexyMofo 




 Muhammed (Pictured right, because terrorist's sensitivities be damned)

That's a picture of 'Ali. Bigots tend to be retarded though so no biggie. 




 I know that they're very unorthodox and would be deemed heretical, but how did this stuff all start?

His political followers came from a large region. Some of them knew nothing about Islam, a lot about their old religions, and he wasn't able to focus on these issues due to the rebellions during his caliphate and he didn't rule long enough to do so either. 




 It is an Alawite belief then, not a Shi'a one, there is a difference.

Alawiyya is as much an off-shoot of tashayu as Ithna Ashariyya 




 1.5 billion people call themselves Muslim. If there's *any* idea about *anything* in the world, I'm sure you'll be able to find representations of it. That said, unlike with Jews in modern times, Muslim groups are less inclined to embrace these variances.

And unlike differences between a Talmudist and a Karaist, the difference between the sects isn't on simply (how do we interpret the holy book) - but different sources of religious material. So in addition to the Qur'an, Sunnis rely on certain books of Prophetic tradition like Muwatta of Imam Malik (~750 AD), Musnad Ahmed (~840 AD), Sahih Muslim (~860 AD) to name a few. Amongst Sunnis, you'll have a bunch of different interpretations (comparable to the Sages arguing issues in the Talmud). But different sects rely on their own books. For most of the major sects, like Ibadi Muslims in Oman and Zaydi Shi'ites (not to be confused with the version of Shi'ism predominant elsewhere) in Yemen, these traditions aren't fundamentally different from Sunni traditions. Many of the traditions are shared - especially since Orthodox/Sunni scholars were meticulous in sourcing reports, and collecting reports - while other Orthodox/Sunni scholars focused on authenticating reports.

The main difference comes with the major branch of Shi'ism in modern times, Ithna Ashari Shi'ism. They have their own religious texts that are generally anti-thetical to Sunni texts. In fact, the fundamental idea of the sect is that the early leaders of Shi'ism were preaching one thing to everybody (and hence why Sunnis have very Sunni leaning reports from the purported originators of Ithna Ashari Shi'ism) - while preaching a secret message to their devout followers. That's why you'll notice if you flip open to a page in a Shi'ite hadith book on a particular legal topic, like saying the word 'Amen' as part of the first prayer, that there are several reports and they mostly unresolvablely contradict each other. One of those reports is what the leader is known to have publicly said about the issue, while the other is his purported secret teaching. They have their own books of religious tradition like al-Kafi (~940 AD), al-Istisbar (~1000 AD), etc.

This branch itself is divided into 3 primary sub-sects: Usoolis, Akhbaris and Sheykis. We won't get into Sheykhis. Usoolis basically argued for a more Sunni style science of tradition (relying on authentication of traditions, Sunni concepts like 'consensus' as a basis for law, etc.). They didn't adopt Sunni religious texts, just some simplistic applications of more refined Sunni hadith sciences. Akhbaris were the more textually inclined, but didn't adopt Sunni-style authentication and favored a more subjective basis for verifying traditions. 




 I think that's an interesting point. I would argue though that suggesting that God must be in this world, which is itself a confined space, requires God to be confined in something material - or at least a "part" of God to be so confined. Would you believe that God is confined, or a part of God is confined, or that God is subdivided into parts? More importantly, I don't believe that our existence is 'real' in the sense that God is literally "The Reality" in Islam, and our plane of existence is itself not something from within which we can ever truly grasp the existence of what brought it about.

To me - that question is a lot like the 'Can God make a rock so heavy that he himself can not lift it' paradox. We affirm that God is unbounded, undivided, infinite and so forth. Than we suggest that God brought into our perception of existence a bounded, divided, finite space. Is God in that space or outside of that space? Or is the question itself flawed? 




 It surprisingly manifests itself in sects of all major religions and some religions (like Sikhi) are completely based on it.

IMO, that's not surprising. If there is an idea, and enough multi-cultural interaction, and the population proclaiming a faith is large, it'll eventually be host to tons of differing ideas. Some of those ideas will die off and we'll never hear about them again, other ideas once niche may become mainstream. Sometimes those ideas will develop in enough of a bubble for something new to be formed and completely new philosophies/religions in entirety can be developed.

In Sikhism, you have for example your more mainstream adoption of the last book as the final Guru while I personally know of at least one sect that has a living Guru even today. The later idea seems to have died off for the most part today, but given the breadth of the religion now in Punjab anyways, it's not hard to find different expressions of it while it's still a very young religion.

Re:Pantheism's expression in Sikhism -India already had a Pantheistic tradition as you know and Muslims/Hindus living far closer than in other areas Muslims occupied - so it would make sense to me that Guru Nanak Gee would've taken some of the ideas from the ancient traditions preserved by Hinduism and incorporated them in Islamic philosophy - then again, we probably have a fundamentally different understanding of what Guru Nanak Gee was accomplishing.

I don't think its completely unworkable within Islam, otherwise Ibn Arabi and others wouldn't have tried. But I feel it already exists to the extent that the 'Knowledge of God' (his ability to perceive) is all existing and all encompassing. In that sense - whereever you are, he's there.

I guess it was easier in Judaism (Kabbalah) because they didn't have a strong opinion on the afterlife.

I think it also has to do with the strain of Judaism that survived and is now mainstream. Judaism took on tons of expressions over the world with new innovators, prophets, Messiahs, Saints, Scholars and what-not. Today, to be a Jew has become so broad, you can have two people who don't agree on anything still be ascribed to the same grouping. It's the ideal environment for Kabbalah to become far more popular than it was in the past when it was confined to a few regions. 




 I am willing to look with brutal honesty

Brutal honesty? You're simply repeating the same tired absurdities.

The Almohads (Sunni followers of madhab al-Zahiri)

There you go again. The almohads didn't follow the defunct madhab (which is a school of law - following the school of law doesn't make you Sunni regardless if your aqeedah isn't Orthodox...), even if their legal system was inspired by it. Their leader Ibn Tumart declared himself the Mahdi - given that the world did not end, in Sunnism, he could not have been the Mahdi. Contemporary Orthodox scholars condemned him and his sect. His Messianic sect has no real association to Orthodoxy just because they gained control of some regions - or to 'the generality of Muslims'...

There were sects and expressions of Islam

Which are irrelevant to the initial assertion I was disputing if they have no tie to the majority of Muslims over the generations - Ahlus Sunnah...those cults killed more Orthodox Muslims than they killed Jews, what's disingenuous is your conflating aberrant sects with Muslims as a generality. It's no different than if I had treated Jews as some sort of monolithic entity and conflated violent expressions of Messianic Judaism through the ages with - Chabbad for instance...its an imbecilic over-simplification.

He himself on a very personal level knew the ravages of Islam and spoke about them in his letter to the Jews of Yemen who themselves faced brutal oppression at the hands of yet another Islamic sect: 

You either enjoying talking about stuff you know nothing about or happen to be a very dishonest individual. That letter - assuming it was actually Maimonides who wrote it - was specifically referring to Shi'ites - who've killed far more Sunnis over 1,000 years than Jews, that were ravaging the Jews of Yemen. And of course, let's completely ignore a violent Jewish Messianic movement that was taking root in Yemen concurrently - because of course its just evil Muslims massacring Jews randomly out of the blue. Maimonides appealed to Salah-al-Din, the Orthodox Muslim leader to handle the mess and save the Jews - but hey that's unimportant to the narrative of random persecution by the generality of Muslims... 




 It is well known that the Quran has a rule that later passages super-cede previous passages. 

You mean naskh (abrogation) in Islamic law? Can you show me where any Muslim scholar has suggested that the prohibition of killing clergy is mansukh? 




 Thought about it for 2 min, and I was just being preposterous and regurgitating somebody else's stupid conspiratorial claim.

The reason that post is at the top and this one is at the bottom is that the members of the sub are collectively pandering imbeciles. 




  It's an endless cycle that needs to stop.

The same could've been said about the 'endless' tit for tat between Muslims and the Crusaders. Nothing is endless.

Thinking that things will get better through violence is mindless nonsense.

Things won't improve through mindless violence like this. But there isn't really a way to organize, or for the occupied people to make hijrah and regroup for the future. They're between a rock and a hard place. 




 I understand where you're coming from, and the knee-jerk reaction to defend against potentially false claims against a minority. But it doesn't look like you've actually looked into this riwayah or its versions for us to really have a meaningful discussion on it instead of going about in loops. This'll be my last post on the topic  - but feel free to look into it further on your own.

But then why does he say   ? Why wouldn't he just say  ? 

That's irrelevant to the fact that its still tantamount to shirk (the guy who's statement I was simply providing evidence for and got dragged into). Qaseem Allah still makes him *The Judge*, even if the interpretation is that he was appointed by Allah to be the Judge. The same way saying that the Aimah are all-hearing and can comprehend all languages, by a miracle of God, still flys in the face of what Monotheism means. A sect of Christians used to believe that God pre-existed but assigned Jesus to create the Universe. Taking His attributes, and reassigning them to intermediaries, even if you're still verbally affirming tawhid is still shirk. Being The Judge on the Day/Creator are some of those particular things exclusive to Him.

And again, you seem to be ignoring the footnote of the source you provided

We must be reading something different, in both footnotes, the editor is affirming that the world is divided amongst those who acknowledge their wilayah and those who reject it...it's not saying that he isn't actively doing the division himself of the people into the places - just explaining what the division is about...

and it's a pretty terrible translation of al-Kafi.

Compared to what? It's the *only* translation into English of this much of al-Kafi...And I'd hardly think somebody who's 'Arabic isn't the best' is in a position to call this translation 'terrible' because (like any translation) there are mistakes.

[source: Al-Mustadarak Ala Al-Sahiheen, volume 3, page 134; footnote says sahih though some Sunni scholars say the chain is weak]

Apologies in advance if I'm coming off pretentious - but here you're conflating **this narration** with completely separate narrations - instead of looking at other versions of this same narration say or even the context I showed of this narration itself - which is leading you to your anachronistic interpretation (that mirrors the Sunni sanitization in Tabaqat Hanabila of a very very short version of this saying that doesn't have the context I provided you from al-Kafi - or any of the other additions beyond the asl). There are other versions of *this* narration on that same exact page of al-Kafi which provide the obvious meaning that I alluded without the apologetic gymnastics you require to sanitize it:       ,**       ** ,    . He's *acting* in that narration, literally doing the determination (). There are tons more versions of these statements with various phrases about how he'll judge in Bihar al Anwar as well...

                      

http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1457_%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A2%D9%A6/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_128

Care to explain to me how he's taking the names of the people in Heaven and Hell (and using it) if it isn't him Judging and he's simply a basis for the Judgement done by Allah himself. I don't know how you can get clearer than that on what the narration obviously means... 




  It's just disgusting to see people come to their aid trying to undermine any articles that are critical of ISIS. 

What's disgusting is your mentality. Let's throw away any semblance of critical thinking because questioning an assertion by an obviously biased party is now tantamount to defending the criminals of ISIS. 




 The Almohads were outside of Ahlus Sunnah (Orthodox Muslims - 90% of Muslims) and he did just fine under Salah-ud-Din when his family was in Egypt...to you, there might not be a distinction - but it would be like me accusing Jews of intolerance because of what Abu 'Isa (leader of a Jewish Messianic cult from Isfahan) did. The person before me asserted a culture of intolerance amongst Muslims as a generality. The generality of Muslims are Orthodox/Sunni. There wasn't the kind of rabid antisemitism that exists today before the 1900s amongst Orthodox Muslims and Maimonides' success in his adult life under Orthodox Muslim rule in Orthodox Muslim society is testament to that. 




 Cutting off the heads of the family whose daughter they couldnt rape isnt that surprising.

'I wouldn't be surprised if you did something like this - therefore let's not even question it and just assume you did'

I hope most people don't think like you.

Does the iraqi government really need more propaganda against ISIS? They do a damn fine job of showing how much of a filthy human beings they are.

It appears that producers of the propaganda feel that [they have needed propaganda](http://revolution-news.com/fake-isis-news-triple-verify-graphic-images/) and [such propaganda has been exposed on multiple occassions](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/claims-isis-buried-women-and-children-alive-should-be-treated-carefully--lJIsWao2Ml).

It's not like the Iraqi govt has any sort of moral high ground demanding that any reasonable person accept anything they say about the conflict w/out question **(NSFL)**. [1](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=602_1404665038)

      = the divider of Allah between heaven and hell, right and
  = the great differentiator?

Your understanding of it means qasim/faruq have effectively the same meaning - so 'Ali is mindlessly repeating "I am the Divider between Heaven and Hell AND I am the Great Divider" - That's the point of the context I provided, Qasim here means (noun) someone who distributes. Not someone who is the basis for a division done by somebody else. [And this is how Shi'ite scholars translated it as well](http://www.al-shia.org/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part4/part4-ch14.htm) and I'm sure it wouldn't take me all of 20 minutes to find Shi'ite scholars corroborating my plain and obvious reading of that Shi'ite tradition (versus the sanitizing here). 




 My mom heard from an Egyptian once that you believe Ishmael went up to be sacrificed by Abraham, but the Torah says that it was Yitzchak/Isaac. You were taught that also? Did you learn that Isaac antagonized Ishmael also or was it not addressed much, their relationship?

It's actually not very clear in Islam, and it also isn't considered important either (it's not an article of faith unlike for Christians because of certain NT passages). Since neither the Qur'an nor Hadith are clear about it, Muslims relied on Israeliyat (traditions of the Jews in Muslim territories) and these Jews narrated contradictory narrations. Some said Isaac, some said Ismael. Muslim scholars by majority seem to have adopted that Ismael was to be slaughtered. I've heard a case can be made for it being Ismael from the Torah as well unless you consider the Hebrew version of the Torah as absolute and preserved. 




 Doesn't sound like he knew much about his own religion and its reverence for Moses than. 




 Blaming the Jews for widespread antisemitism? That's bold. And baseless. Fuck you with a rusty crowbar.
The earliest recorded act of Arab antisemitism in the modern era was the Damascus Affair in 1840. French monks imported the blood libel to harm the local Jewish population for local Christian gain. Antisemitism is a mind-virus that spreads like wildfire; it's very easy for a population to hate the Other and very tempting for those in power to use scapegoats for their own ends.

The question isn't about the earliest recorded act of antisemitism. The issue here is when "antisemitism among the Islamic community started to flourish". If you want to pretend that antisemitism in the community that brought you Maimonides just came up out of nowhere because Muslim communities just randomly became intolerant and antisemitic for no reason whatsoever out of thin air, that's bold. And baseless. 




 The title of Ali as the distributor of heaven and hell is mentioned in a few Sunni books

Saying "Sunni books" doesn't mean the narration is a Sunni narration, or an authentic narration. Sunni books have quotes from early Shi'ites, Kharijjis, etc. etc. etc. Simply pointing to a gharib hadith in an obscure book isn't the same as these things actually being a part of anybody's aqeeda.

 Kanz ul Ummal

Kanz ul Ummal is a tertiary source, you need to find the asl of the narration to a different book if you want to suggest this is a Sunni belief, or even a truly Sunni tradition.

Tabaqat al-Hanabilah

This explanation of the tradition by Ahmed b. Hanbal, which is sanitizing the obvious meaning of the tradition, is from several hundred years after him and also without a chain. But you're comparing this sanitized Sunni reinterpretation of a likely fabricated Imami Shi'ite tradition (in its origin) that is *indisputably* referring to 'Ali as the Judge on Yawm ul Qiyamah (see the full context in the link):

 :         

http://www.alseraj.net/maktaba/kotob/hadith/kafi1/html/ara/books/al-kafi-1/78.html

and the hadith mentioned by Ibn Hanbal is found in Sahih Muslim: 

There's no dispute surrounding that hadith. The ahadith in question are the ones that support the other guy's claim that Imami Shi'ism supports the idea that 'Ali, and not Allah, is the judge on the Day of Judgement on God's behalf. This is tantamount to shirk as the Qu'ran is pretty clear on Allah directly, and exclusively, being the one you answer to. 




 After all, if God is always separate from creation, how could He draw near to us or us to Him?

I don't know that ought to read it as Him drawing near at all necessary. It's simply a poetic statement about how we should try to draw close to God and we'll be recompensed for it by Him in a way that's disproportionately beneficial to us - as I see it.

that is God doing an action that we are experiencing here in time and space, not in the realm of God. 

Doing an action within Space/Time, versus Him existing bi-dhatihi in Space/Time is different IMO. The fact that He is the One who originated Space/Time through the Big Bang, or what-have-you, already necessitates that He is able to act on Space/Time without being in it. 




 There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.

I don't know about this incitement against Jews in the Muslim world. I've been fortunate enough to meet, or know of through others, Jewish communities that thrive in Morroco, Syria and Iran. An incitement against Israel? Sure. But against Jews that have been living in Muslim countries for generations and aren't (at least not overtly) gung-ho on the Israel issue, doesn't seem to generally be an issue.

There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.

Nobody in the Muslims world doesn't accept the existence of Israel. It's hard not to accept that there isn't a place called 'Israel' on the map nowadays. If you're saying that you hope Muslims would just cow-tow to this recent geo-political change though and accept the new state of affairs into perpetuity, then you've misunderstood your neighbors. The Crusaders lived in Palestine for generations. They had children, and their children had children and their children's children had children -all before those who refused to live as subjects of Salah al-Din were sent packing. As much as you want to maintain the status quo, and many Muslims want to revert it, only time will tell how the Middle East will look in 50 years. 




 It wasn't until after the crusades that antisemitism among the Islamic community started to flourish.

I don't think its attributable to post-Crusades - I think there's a point in the early 1700s when the more successful Jewish Messianic agitations started and the early 1900s when the first overtly Zionist 'Aliyah's began that led to modern issues. 




 link? 




 But I don't know if those views take them outside the fold of Islam. 

It wouldn't - it might take them out of the jama' if there are some institutionalized ideas/practices aberrant from the jama' - but I don't think its a valid basis for takfir. Deobandis in Pakistan/India tend to be critical of some of these ideas but the foremost sub-continent scholar, Mufti Taqi Usmani wrote a rather [balanced piece](http://www.deoband.org/2010/05/hadith/hadith-commentary/wahdat-al-wujud-wahdat-al-shuhud-and-the-safest-position/) on the topic.

A lot of poets used language that may be considered shirk in common place talk, but they are given the benefit of the doubt (I believe Imam al Ghazali discussed this issue as well) without endorsing any literal understanding of their statements.

The key idea of tawheed seems to be that the Creator and Creation are separate and will always remain separate. Despite being closer to you than your jugular vein, Allah does not actually exist there.

Exactly - its a matter of context. Wahdatul Wujood is based on mindlessly literal interpretations of statements like that (against the norm of the scholarship). There are other traditions which state things like 'God approaches you as you approach him', 'if you walk to God, God will run to you' - where likewise, mindlessly literal interpretations that fly against the general consensus of their reading would lead to the opposite of Wahdatul Wujood, even possibly to outright anthropomorphism. 




 Right - because the Iraqi government (the source of this claim) certainly couldn't have made this up. We all know ISIS is barbaric but the amount of straight up retarded propaganda being put out is ridiculous. 




 Ridiculous concepts like infallibility of aimah may not be shirk, but making 'Ali Maliki yawm ad-din is most definitely shirk.... 




 I'm not saying to walk around toting guns like some of these modern confederacy loving nutjobs. But having *the ability* to defend yourself by arming yourself, under your fourth amendment rights isn't an insane concept to me. Keep spreading honey, but keep a gun in case the bear comes. 




 In LA, New York, Chicago and Seattle - I've seen people sleeping and tweaking out only a few blocks away from high end boutique shops in downtown areas. Yes, it's generally not directly under the boutique stores so you can say the image is an exaggeration in applying it to most 'Western' states - but you're just missing the point than. 




 Part of that is that Judaism, unlike Islam or Christianity, started as the religion of a tribe more than a universal Truth. 
However, Judaism has been a more conversion-centric religion in the past.

This doesn't make sense to me. On the one hand, you mention yourself that ancient Judaism was a proselytizing religion (Khazars, magicians in the court of Pharoah, several passages about how the Temple was intended to invite goyyim etc. are some examples). At the same time, you're suggesting that ancient Judaism was more of a "tribe" than a "universal truth" (i.e. the way it is today). That appears to be a contradiction to me - but maybe you can explain more where you're coming from here? 




 ISIS seems barbaric and heartless.

ISIS leadership is barbaric. Some people do believe in Shariah, but don't take the actions attributed to ISIS as being Shariah. Their most recent apparent execution of a man who converted to Islam before he was taken into captivity isn't even allowed under any interpretation of Orthodox Islamic treatment of POWs for instance.

But then again, you're lumping up ISIS - its a large group of loosely knit together groups. Some of these groups have been responsible for positive things in Iraq and Syria, such as maintaining the safety of Hindu female nurses and returning them to India without a ransom or anything - rebuilding roads, public transportation, court systems, welfare distribution, etc.

My western society seems so much better with much more freedom and justice.

Is it though? [Look around](http://i.imgur.com/k0Cowji.jpg). The amount of destitution, serial homelessness, complete neglect of the mentally ill, depression/suicide, no qualms with commercializing female sexuality (almost exclusively), selling your life away to a 9-5 - drinking yourself retarded to forget on the weekends - and hoping you live long enough to cash in on social security, mass exploitation of your elderly by casino/gambling industries, **Comcast** - it isn't justifiable in countries with GDP that happens to be multiples of GDP of countries with greater levels of polled human contentment around the world. 




 I found it interesting that action fans cared most about directors. But at the same time, I feel like that metric might be a bit skewed by all the people using Google to determine if Uwe Boll directed so they can avoid the film like the plague. 




 It's basically a large info-graphic advertisement for the entertainment industry to adopt more of the professional services Google offers in its Youtube brand. 




 Few corrections. It was there before Mohammed, but after a flood and before he started preaching Islam, he helped the tribes over a conflict of who gets to replace it.

Pilgrims also aren't pointing to it, but they do touch/kiss it. Umar, the second Caliph of the Muslims after Mohammed, reportedly said in front of other Muslims (to the stone), "I know you're a rock and can't benefit and harm anyone, I wouldn't kiss you had I not seen our Prophet kiss you." He was exclaiming that he's carrying on a tradition, out of love for his predecessor and not because he even understood the point behind it. 




 But where's Waldo? 




 The black stone is actually outside of the building structure. 




 Regardless, you're on a list now just fyi :) 




 There are militias all over the country, especially the south, without any popular support. They exist and thrive because they strongly believe in making use of their fourth amendment right. No need to go around killing people, but being armed and able to protect your own (what a militia effectively is) is a positive thing. As a most recent example, compare what happened at Bundy (no violence, just militias taking positions) versus the suffering all around Ferguson. 




 Keep rolling along. Truth is clear from falsehood. 




 Not even an estimate, its just a bullshit number. The Kurds want more foreign aid and intervention, making the situation appear more dire (when its actually improved) is a great way to accomplish that end. 




 Yes, lets pretend the Umayyads dynasties which had such precious Caliphs like Yazid were the epitome of tolerance and generosity

Right - because one anecdotal leader is reflective of the whole. His father's reign was the exact opposite of what you're accusing his of being like, with even Christian annal's reporting on how just he was (see 'Seeing Islam As Others Saw It...' - the extracts from Jon Bar Penkaye). As far as Yazid, would love to see any authentic reports on how he was 'intolerant'. Yazid had at least one Christian adviser (Sarjun) close to him for the short period of time he governed - doesn't come off as terribly intolerant...but I suppose its easier to just make things up?

                              

Wow - He's talking about the divisions between these groups allowing for easy pickings / divide and conquer - from the same passage:        . At-Tusi explicitly helped and became an aide to the invaders - how on earth is al-albani's criticism of disunity and infighting even comparable to outright treason by at-Tusi in your mind?

Or even Ibn Abi al-Hadeed stated in Sharh Nahaj al-Balagha, Volume 8 page 237:

Right...Because a reference to a late religious commentary by a Mutazili Shi'ite scholar, on a Shi'ite religious book - that has no asl for half the narrations it contains with a sanad in any reputable religious text of Sunnis or Shi'ites - is a great basis for **a historical claim**...

Finally, if At-Tusi was such an evil man as per this fairy-tale of an allegation, ibn Khaldun wouldn't have ever studied at-Tusi's famous works.

Brilliant logic. If you don't like a person, you'll refuse to benefit from their knowledge. I hope it works out for you - but historically, that's not how Sunni scholars operated. Every book of history and ahadith has plenty of reports from non-Sunnis, even political opponents like Khawwarij. Orthodox scholarship's openness to benefit from the information recorded, even by political opponents isn't an indictment of them or an exoneration of the man in question for what he did to Baghdad. 




  I don't think things are simple as making their own laws, issues about leadership (which started this) will arise, and it seems like one group will try to dominate the other, as seems to be the case historically. 

I agree - it won't solve the succession problem, but it eliminates tensions that arise in modern systems. In spite of any violence under the Ottoman's over power, there was nothing like the random sectarian intra-religious violence in former Ottoman regions today. I don't think that style of decentralization is impossible in modern times either - the Ottoman's fell like 100 years ago. That's a lot of time for you and me, but in the grand scheme of things, their collapse was pretty modern and they seemed to be doing just 

The fact of the matter is that Islam doesn't seem to be a uniting force at the moment, and with all the bad blood between Sunnis and Shias

I'd argue the opposite. Sunnis today are more tolerant of one another than ever in history after all four of the madhahib had become well-established. You don't get Hanafis beefing with Shafi'is for the most part and so on. You have disagreements, but they're dealt with in populist munazaras, not out in the street with fists or guns. There were certain points in time when there used to be riots about these issues. Sunnis and Ithna Ashari Shi'ites + Alawis may not be close - but that's 90% of people who call themselves Muslim vs 9%. Likewise, Sunnis and Ibadis have gotten closer than ever in history in modern times as well. We keep seeing the results of one or two conflicts blasting our news station that paint a much bleaker picture, IMO. 




 I didn't suggest that 'sectarianism' is inherent in the "shariah of Allah". Just that the peachy view you suggested of Sunni-Shi'ite relations isn't as close to reality as you'd probably like.

People can turn sects into political groups or tribes and use them as an excuse to kill each other.

The issue here is that Ithna Ashari Shi'ism, as a sect, is inherently a political group that vyes with any existing system. Especially post Safavid Ithna Ashari Shi'ism, most especially modern Usooli Ithna Ashari Shi'ism after Khomayni's introduction of waliyat-ul-faqih in Shi'ism, replacing the need for somebody to pretend to be a Shi'ite Mahdi to establish political dominion.

Yes, people can manipulate religions for power politics - and yada yada yada - but Sunni religious texts don't promote competition with existing power, even if the ruler isn't a jolly fellow, as long as the ruler is Muslim. Sunni political quietism even allowed praying behind Khawwarij that took over territories. Or the non-violent responses of people like Ahmed b. Hanbal to 'heretical' ideas being imposed by the Amir of his time. 




 Everyone wants to end bloodshed, which is why the popular solution to this sectarianism seems to be secularism.

Dunno how popular that solution is, but it isn't always a working solution. After the Ottomon's, who ruled with some sort of Islamic law and allowed parties paying jizya to rule according to their own laws, we had secularism across much of their former territories. It only gave rise to violence along ethnic, religious and sectarian lines - along with newer, violence along ideological lines. Adding more abstractions and calling people to them only makes the violence worse, imo. 




 Sunnis and shi'ites have been living side by side for hundreds of years. 
There have been problems, but up until modern times...

What are you smoking? Shi'ite sects created their own states and fought wars with the major Caliphates since the inception of Imami Shi'ism. From the Fatimids, to the Hashashins to the Safavids (just to list the more successful examples). At-Tusi, one of the major mashaykh of modern Ithna Ashari Shi'ism and an author of several works basically personally escorted the Mongol invaders into Baghdad to rape, pillage and raze the centre of the Muslim world. 




 The Daily Mail. /R/WorldNews' favorite bullshit tabloid. 




 None of these got shit on Fox news. 




 If you can't beat them, let them beat themselves up.

Several red states have been beating themselves up economically. They still vote Republican. Because Jesus.

Same way blue states have been eating their own shit for ages. They still vote Democrat. Because butt-secks. 




 What's the point? Our senators [will just filibuster him](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/us-senator-filibusters-live-coverage-powerful-palestinian-testimonies). Informed democracy and all. 




 No, they are most def not lol. And also, how many republican Jews do u know?

Koch is a pretty Jewish last name...and being Jewish doesn't mean. Nice ignorant generalization of Jews as some sort of monolithic entity.

but as other commenters point out, that's a pretty easy citizenship to obtain

Uh ya...if you've got at least one Jewish grand-parent, easy as pie.... 




 The title is a blatant rip-off of the Vice video from a while back.

I wonder where they're selling their oil though - as it looks like the entire thing is built on their take-over of Syrian production. 




 Their economy seems to be entirely based on black market oil. Who's buying their oil? 




 Of course the eventual demise of the Zionist entity in the Middle East is approaching, sooner rather than later.

Every Arab country with a military capable of actually taking on Israel has been thrown into chaos. Not so sure about your take on this. 




 Ah - gotcha. Executions don't make for exciting footage. IMO, its not much different from an explosion though. Actually, a far more humanizing reminder of why we naturally are repulsed by war. 




 What do you expect? When you remove people's ability to express themselves democratically, all you get is bloodshed. 




 but I just can't take actually watching these videos anymore.

Really? I've said it once and I'll say it again - the production value these guys are putting out is amazing. I've watched a lot of videos over the years put out by different governments to propogandize their military achievements. What's being produced by these non-state actors is some of the best by far.

This one is just a long propaganda clip with a bunch of action (executions, drive-bys, battles, explosions) with a bunch of Arabic anasheed in the background. It starts by encouraging people to oppose 'oppression' and then breaks into the various clips of their activities in the region as well as some posing (going into sujood near large explosions). Very well-edited, practically professionally. They have explosions for instance which if you got a keen eye, you'll know they threw into the video even though they didn't connect. They also use great effects. Around the middle of the film they begin their standard preaching and what-not (the boring stuff) but get right back into the combat footage after a few min.

Edit: Also noticed that whereas with ISIS videos and the like, a lot of the fighters are obviously older men. This video - they're all kids. Almost everyone in the video is under 25. The video is very tailored to the kids without jobs who likely lost family members or friends during the Sisi coup. 




 The results of protracted, perpetual war. Your enemy improvises and becomes more adept. 




 Can you post the translation directly here (or in a self-post)? 




 People who don't understand how the blockchain works believe bitcoin provides true anonymity (in spite of the premise being that it runs on a public ledger). Anonymity is key to criminal and terrorist organizations. 




 Which is why they'll have average citizens of IS trade in their common currencies. They'll use that currency as needed, but the cities under them will conduct commerce with the new coinage. If this reporting is accurate  




 Probably no punishment, but you can imagine they'd issue an edict that everybody needs to transfer their common floating currencies in exchange for ISIS dinars. They'd implement it the same the United States did when each of them moved away from gold and average citizens were robbed under threat of imprisonment.

ISIS is also largely a welfare 'government' - so there wouldn't be too much seizing necessary to boot. 




 They have plenty of territories under their control. Trade functions in literally the same way as it does in any other place in Syria/Iraq. People still work in local industry, or they join militias for money, and they participate in local markets (buying food, books, etc.) 




 I don't think it's the mayor. Quality mainstream journalism is at an all time low. 




 Also expected that they seize a lot of gold jewelry from men, it being haram and all.

Men wearing gold in the non-upper classes of the Arab world isn't as popular as it is in the ghettos of America. I doubt they would have much to seize. 




 They've designed a Caliphate in the modern age with zero air power, and attracted some of the best-equipped militaries around the world to fight a proxy war against them. I don't think they'll let a little bit of 'lack of preperation' or 'not enough metal' get in the way of their delusions. 




 Guy's got huge balls but no brain (pun intended) 




 The whole point of getting what will soon be a rare collectible piece is to keep it in mint condition. You melt it down, and that value is gone. 




 Video is removed - no mirror? 




 They should be - this is a pretty big step for violent non-state actors, one of unprecedented ingenuity. 




 isis apologist??? hhhhhhh. I just don't believe in the black-and-white good-and-evil story tale of world history and current events...

As you say yourself, there are people like yourself who 'as bad as isis is, we are worse' - that's all I suggested. 




 Taliban eradicated it because they had a hold of power. When they came under attack they needed a quick and easy supply of money, and thus they re-planted the opium fields again. 

You sound like you're insinuating that NATO is behind the increase in opium cultivation, and that is complete BS. You belong in /r/conspiracy if that is the case. 

Except...that you're full of it. Even after the invasion, they had prohibited opium production whereas [NATO was explicitly allowing it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6589113.stm). In fact - NATO was advertising itself to the common man under that EXACT premise (we allow you to grow opium - Taliban doesn't). You are categorically wrong - that article is from *well* after the invasion while opium production was beginning to rise again. 




 You can't take one case to be representative of the whole given that Daesh has a very autonomous structure. 




 Not to mention that Israel has intermittently launched strikes against SAA hardware at various points in time, including during the recent rebellion. 




 yes i know i have issues.

You absolutely do. 




 What you are supporting is that Iraqis should stoop down to the level of these barbaric Daesh dogs.

Stoop down? No doubt Daesh are barbaric, but I don't know of one credible assertion of torture by them. The closest thing to torture that they've provable done would be their **allowing** Rafah citizens to beat Syrian soldiers to death. They kill their captives and don't give the 'right of repentance' to Shi'ite prisoners - sure. But that's not the same as torture. Whereas Shi'ite militias have been torturing Sunni captives to death since the removal of Saddam:

[The Independent 2005](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/britishtrained-police-in-iraq-killed-prisoners-with-drills-516158.html)
[Amnesty 2013](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/iraq-torture-2013-06-28)

And mind you, this isn't the selective torture that Saddam or the United States have been accused of for gathering intel. This is pure sadism, they were literally torturing men to death with one military objective over the last several years. You don't turn a majority Sunni city (like Baghdad) into a majority Shi'ite one without some persuasive techniques. ISIS didn't gain this clout in a vaccum, there's plenty of context. If you followed Golden Brigade on Facebook prior to our recent entry into that country (that's a US elite trained group within the Iraqi army) - you would've seen videos (NSFW) [like this](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) proudly posted on their page.

We might hear about the crimes of one side more often, but if you critically look at the evidence, its a bit hard to establish moral high ground for any particular side. 




 The big losers from this will be the Palestinians and rioting Israeli-Arabs.

Maybe - but there will be **no winners**. None. 




 They kill POWs, as well as torture them and desecrate corpses. Daish doesn't have some kind of monopoly on executing POWs. Daesh manages to capture and kill more in a single sitting **and** brag about it in high-production value propaganda videos. Doesn't mean army/Shi'ite militias don't do it - in fact, I've got quite the depressing collection of videos to the contrary. 




 These guys rival Daesh in production quality 




 It's a conspiracy theory about the video. A pretty shitty one if you know anything about guns or camera phones. But skepticism is always a step in the right direction so I guess this may be a good thing in a way. 




 Because they're evil and they hate Jews for no reason. 




 Can someone explain why Kobane matters to **anybody** militarily? Minus all the so-called symbolic bs... 




 Best part is, we have to assume they can't use the internet from within Syria. Somebody had to get the video to Turkey/Lebanon to upload. And somehow they still pull off with better video editing and live reporting than the white house. 




 Can't believe this didn't hit front page - in light of everything recently.. 




 Washingtonian here, and local history buff. Seattle grew prominent later on in the game. Olympia however was our original primary city of port commerce. In the mid-1800s when it became the capital, **everybody** thought it would be the center of the state given its than-existing role and its exponential rate of growth. It wasn't a good 30+ years later when we were about to join the union that different cities did vye for the title. 




 Yezidis are both an ethnicity of Kurds and also a religion that often get conflated (think Jews), especially recently. This family is Muslim.

It's really strange (for me) to be hearing about all the alleged persecution of "Satanic Yazidis" of late since I know for a fact that Mandeans and Yazidis are almost non-existent religions. But we can't play the genocide card to justify more ground troops unless we can sell a plausible story - and Muslim extremists being harsh against an obscure religion sounds about right for what we need. 




 Well, I'm never making it to the ruling class. Is there a waitlist for the roving marauders? 




 Let's hope people confront their foolishness without being run over. 




 A lot of people have lost friends and family members in this war. You can expect the children growing up in this conflict to be affected by it. 




 What's odd is that every piece of media that comes from that organization does precisely that. Everything they put out seems to help justify foreign presence. 




  One of the seven deadly sins is vengence/wrath...is this true in Islam?

Vengence is not a sin in Islam.

Wrath is also not, in and of itself, a sin. Islam differentiates between thoughts and actions. A "bad" thought isn't a sin. Acting on a "bad" thought is. Having a "bad" thought, and not acting on it is actually good deed. 




  Something like revenge might have a neutral value - it is not wrong, but it is not exactly righteous either.

You're right - and the religion treats foregoing permissible revenge as being a 'good deed' 




 CONGRATS! Don't care what anyone says, if you got the gall to come out while a public official, you earn a lot of my respect. That could be political suicide, even in a liberal society because y'know, people care about shit like that. 

Depends on where you're located. In Seattle, the fact that the mayor was all about the butt secks is what allowed him to capitalize on voters. He than went on to repeal police reform, destroy any chance of municipal internet, diminish the effects of the $15/hr wage reform campaign - and generally every single thing he could possibly do that his progressive voters would never have anticipated. 









 The Iraqi army and Iraqi mobs also do the same thing. Countless videos, of explicit torture, using corpses as decals and dragging corpses through the street. Nothing in this video is unique to just ISIS or the Syrian rebels. Minus the production value on the video - that's somethiing only ISIS can pull off. 




 Fines disproportionately affect the poor. Corporal punishment is comparatively equitable... 




 Excuse me to break you, but there's now for a first time ever an actual Islamic terrorist country

The US said the same thing when Iran popped up. And when the Taliban popped up in Afghanistan. The British government was saying the same thing about what would become the Saudi Kingdom. It's not the "first time ever" - so-called "Islamic" states have long existed and Western powers have always considered them "terrorist" states.

a stated ambition to conquer no less but the entire world

Their stated ambition is to have a borderless state - capable of expansionism (as in, the sort of states that existed not even 100 years ago all over the world). So - at worst - they're people who hypothesize about perpetual war but have never experienced it. Since it's inception, the US has ACTUALLY been perpetually in conflict - not just in theory - but in **actuality**. You want to focus on scary international politics? Check your backyard. 




 Were my words to complex for you?

too* 




  Nobody else here is mentioning this? Y'all need to step up your game. This is what happens when the neo-nazis chase off all the intelligent people.

It makes more sense that they conspired to make a profit than that there was an ulterior motive with a conspiracy to eliminate particular negative genetic traits... 




 You rock. 




 The internet: where everyone makes 6 figures and has a 12 inch cock. 




 Mission Accomplished! 




 ~~This~~ war is so fucked up.

In previous 'good' wars, we justified mass civilian casualties from firebombings like Dresden to nuclear attacks against civilian populations. This war is only as bad as it is because its happening in our lifetimes. 




 By that logic, you can't blame ISIS or FSA for anything either. Individual units that gave their bayah to their leader, or are part of FSA, act relatively independently (with the exception of taking orders on locations to post for the former). 




 I don't see how you guys can conflate one anecdotal alleged assault on a guy with "OMG Turks, in general, support ISIS". It's just bad logic. 




 Sounds like your average nationalist, nothing special... 




 Nah, it's not that bad. These are just corpses. Iraqi Military Shi'ites burned alive followers of Sarkhi and used to document torture of alleged ISIS members. Here are some of the videos I've posted previously (it's part of the narrative that isn't going to be covered in typical media reports):

 The only way to know for sure is to invite her over and wait completely butt naked on the couch. Come back and give me gold after she bangs you and then breaks up with her man. 




 I do the same thing and spank their ass while yelling. Let them really know who's king of the korridor. 




  People shit on the floor in my store about once a week

The fuck - what city is this? 




 I didn't say Orthodoxy encourages secularism. The leader still upholds religious law. He's just not a source for jurisprudence. His opinion has value in that he can declare wars and what-not, but he doesn't tell you how to pray for instance.

As for ISIS, there's plenty of evidence of beheadings/mass executions - don't think I've seen anything verified suggesting they torture people. 




  Just out of interest, if he ever became legit, as a caliph, he is like the pope, so surely he would be refered to as "His Holiness Abu Bakr al Baghadadi"

No. In Orthodox Islam, the leader of the state isn't also (necessarily) your spiritual leader. 




 Let's be *a little rational here*. The source for this is quoting the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights on a statement allegedly made by al-Baghdadi. If that doesn't give you pause before blindly swallowing the claim...

Also - burning corpses and living people isn't IS modus operandi, barbaric as they are. It's more something a group we support, like the Golden Brigade from [the Iraqi Army is known to do.](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=602_1404665038) **NSFW** 




 No. Dave Firth isn't the idiot. You are for believing an anonymous source from the Daily Mail... 




 And to boot, the claim about sectarian motive was purportedly made by his anonymous friend. There is no result from the investigation yet - just a bullshit editorialized headline. 




 This is the daily mail, not a particularly reputable rag. There are literally *no* known facts yet. The claim that it was even a sectarian attack is entirely based on the purported statement of the man's friend. 




  These elections undermine the agreement 

But they don't break the agreement right? Russia with the technical win. 




 Woah woah woah, don't be rational here. We're trying to have an anti-Russian circle-jerk and you just want to ruin the fun

3--- 3--- 3--- 




 Yep, but certainly not as above board and legit as post war elections in Iraq and Afghanistan while those nations were still occupied, right? 




 Not Sunnis in general - looks like only those Sunnis who align themselves *against IS* while in territory *controlled by IS* suffer. Minus the level of brutality and summary nature of their punishments, it's not much different than aligning yourself against the government of any region you live in. Just a generally unwise thing to do, seeing as how everyone killed was [Sahwa or with the Iraqi govt apparatus](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/why-did-islamic-state-counter-terrorism-implementation-task-force-execute-over-300-sunni-albu-612737)
 




 Don't question the repeated stories of 10-20 guys overpowering and executing hundreds. Over and over. 




 Yep - unbeatable KDR 




 The numbers sound a bit huge. These guys are really good at rounding up 100s of opponents at a time and just dumping on em. 




 There are **literally** over a hundred groups operating in the region. Even the major buzz-words like FSA, Shi'ite Militias, ISIS, are actually conglomerates of other smaller independent groups.
