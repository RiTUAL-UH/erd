 Wouldn't mind hearing Muse have a crack it. As I understand, they were being considered for Skyfall. Supposedly [Supremacy by Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avM_UsVo0IA) was their take on a Bond song, pretty catchy. 




 I recommend Arrow as well. The first half of Season 1 can be a bit silly as it is trying to find its footing but towards the end of Season 1 the show becomes really special imo. The character development is really great, especially for a show like Arrow. Season 2 is amazing as it becomes more of a personal battle since they bring in a pretty big villain (not going to say who), they just do a really good job of world building imo especially since they are going to cross over with the Flash as well.  




 That George Costanza look alike always kills me. 




 Hey there, I live in Sydney and visited HK for a week in Jan and loved it. Realistically how long do you think the protests can go on for before the government decides to implicate some kind of martial law? Sorry if this is a dumb question as I haven't being following the events too closely.  




 This may sound dumb but I really enjoyed the mid credits sequence in Fast 6.  




 PS4/Australia/V-MAN_24 




 Driveclub, I have been yearning for a racer on the PS4 since launch, NFS Rivals did very little to fill that gap unfortunately.  




 How the fuck are two dresses valued more than an Aston Martin DB5? 




 I also thought that the shot of the Star Destroyer flying overhead was pretty awesome as well. 




 Is the term black mark specific to PSN or just games in general.  




 Nooo ad break fuck you one hd 




 While that does suck that there will be people who will just troll race, i'm actually surprised at how smooth it looks online. Usually you have racers just appearing and lagging around most of the time.  




 Yeah that was was my only real gripe with the episode. I kind of preferred the blocky looking TCW wookies.  




 So my question here is whether Disney would allow for a gritty Star Wars cable television show for a network like HBO or among that realm of quality. Something along the lines of the Star Wars Underworld series that was promised before Disney bought Lucasfilm.  




 Sorry to be that guy but I am an Australian who has started to follow this subreddit due to the events happening, can someone translate this? 




 Hopefully if the new Star Wars Battlefront will be as epic as we hope, then you may very well be able to experience it.  




 To be honest I would not completely rule out marvel picking Mel Gibson to direct Iron Man 4. They tend to go with directors who aren't huge or are obscure choices, however all of them have worked out great. Here's hoping Mel gets a big gig like this, so he can flex his creative muscle.  




 I'm lucky enough here in Sydney to watch it on the biggest IMAX screen in the world. Ghost Protocol and Dark Knight Rises looked amazing on them. Especially in GP when Cruise is climbing the tower. [Here's a picture](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y379ux1lBg8/UFFw5EC3TwI/AAAAAAAACNw/ocDNs1BxZUM/s1600/50.jpg)

 Ah I see, thanks! 




 So did the hiring of Claire mean that the asset in the previous episode was hired in the same way? It seems the asset had a bit more training and was more professional but given time I feel Claire may become as ruthless.  




 WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?! 




 I also have an MSI R9 280x which has been factory over clocked, however because its over clocked it does make the game artefact. Download MSI Afterburner and down clock the card using that program. These are my settings and I haven't experienced any artefacts or weird texture stretching.

Core Clock: 1020 Mhz
Memory Clock: 1160 Mhz

Everything else is left at default settings. Give that a go and see if it works. I'm currently running it in Mantle. 
 




 The script didn't really ask her to deliver much though. 




 I'm not American but the USA is a very large country with lots of people so it's not unexpected that you would see more Americans freaking out, especially when a lot of people in America have access to phones with cameras that can instantly upload said freakouts.  




 What I mean by this is the blue computer like hud interface they had. I felt it looked more slicker than the one in BF4. Especially when you're getting points/killing opponents, the way the points screen animates on the bottom really made me prefer it. Maybe i'm wrong however in that the one in BF4 just works better since it's more simpler and straight the point (been a while since I played BF3). 




 Thanks for that buzz killington. 




 God damn why can't we get something like this in Australia. I wouldn't even eat the food... 




 I don't think a list of 10 can contain this guy. Film's like Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, Da Vinci Code and Man of Steel are all fantastic soundtracks.  




 Knifing in BF2/2142 was the biggest shit show.  




 Haha ah right, thanks. 




 I see, thanks guys.  




 I enjoyed it mainly because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are great in it, the story however is pretty much a misfire unfortunately. 




 I belive P.T is exclusive but the final game will be multiplatform.  




 Can someone tell me what the mask is for? 




 Can someone please tell me what this is from? I keep seeing it said in relation to fat people. 




 This game was so frustrating for me. It was beautiful and had amazing art design and it also had the setting for an amazing story but they didn't go anywhere with it. It's annoying because Killzone has such fantastic lore and characters to explore but they seem to squander the opportunities.  




 If they actually address the problems with the UI then yes. I don't really care for themes, I would rather have folders, more streamlined notifications and faster loading of the friends list/messages. 




 Man the mud in that game blew me away when I first played it, was so fun just doing donuts in the mud! 




 I remember being blown away by it when I first saw it in GT3. 




 I know that most people hated this film but I thought The Counsellor was an interesting tale as it basically shows us that bad things will happen when you involve yourself with bad people. There's just the blunt consequences and no redemption in the film.  




 I would say the Nolan batman films lean more on the realistic side. 




 This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

and finally my personal favourite.

 That's the one Batman jumps off in Dark Knight right? 




 I really loved this scene in Man of Steel and feel it was easily one of the better superhero moments in any of the recent comic book films that have come out in the last few years. 









 Every choice of song in the show as been on point in my opinion.  




 Hmm the trailer points it out to be fairly generic but then again so did Edge of Tomorrow. I'm hoping that it's actually a really smart/cool sci fi film and the trailer is just aiming to get as many people into theatres as possible.  




 I'm so torn because a Blade Runner directed by Scott with his signature visual flair would be awesome but Scott is also a director who is dependent on having a good script to make the film come together. I was in the camp of people who enjoyed Prometheus but obviously felt it was very flawed and the counselor was a strange one for me as I could not really pin the film down and how i felt about it. 




 Yep very reasonable price imo which means this will be my first AAA game to be purchased digitally on my PS4. 




 2015? I saw this like 3 weeks ago in Australia. FYI it's actually a surprisingly great film can't wait you guys think of it.   




 No that's probably due to the actual animation of the game and whatever kind of motion capture they used. It's just uncanny valley.  




 It's a whole new audience today compared to 2005. Things have changed considerably in that time frame, also Avatar had the benefit of having higher 3D ticket prices which no doubt played a vital factor in it's crazy box office gross.  




 But we already have the VW Passat in Australia, just seems really weird to be testing this car here. 




 If anyone wants to relive [the feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkrXd37BYIA) 




 I reckon the machine has already gone ahead and set up a bunch of equipment and computers and that's what Finch is in awe of. 




 To be honest it's pretty hard to avoid trailer's these days since they show them before the actual film... 




 It still burns me on how Gearbox fucked AC:M at the expense of Borderlands. Did Gearbox ever officially comment on why the game never looked like it's initial reveal? 




 lol who the fuck would buy the 2nd cover, looks terrible. 




 Honestly dude wouldn't recommend the cross (especially because of the lockout laws), personally I am more of a bar person. There's usually nice bars around the darling harbour area also if you are into whiskey there's Baxters inn on Clarence Street although it can be a bit difficult to find since it's in an alley and its underground.  




 Where is this? 




 Yep this is the obvious one and I also love it. Watching that in 3D on opening day was an experience. Say what you want about the story but but as purely technical film it is flawless in my opinion.  




 Yep another great one. Also a shout out to Inception as well with the Japanese castle at the start of the film. 




 You could check out Almost Human although it was unfortunately cancelled by Fox and they ran the episodes out of order for some retarded reason. 




 Same here, I live in Sydney and have only ever seen undercover falcons or commodores.  




 By this I mean a scene in a big budget film, from which the viewer is first introduced to the world. My favourite is possibly in Tron Legacy when [Sam arrives onto the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6V69KaG4a8). The music combined with the visuals make it such a treat!

EDIT: higher quality link 




 Nice fact about this trailer is that it was directed by Joseph Kosinsky (Tron:Legacy, Oblivion) 




 I might be wrong but I think they may have both credits when the director has a hand in producing the film as well or his production company has helped produce it.  









 I live in Bella Vista which is right next to Hillsong and the crowd that place draws is fucking huge! I'm an atheist but my cousin is super Christian and into these hip youth churches like Hillsong and Nexus Youth, anyway I had to drop her off into the church one day and the guys managing the car park seemingly make it a hassle to actually leave the carpark since they constantly misdirect you and ask you questions about why you aren't staying etc. Also i'm pretty sure Hillsong own the Gloria Jeans just across in the shopping center which is super popular amongst the church goers.  




 I think it will be a flat 8 




 I predict this will have hilarious outcomes.  




 That scream... 




 [Mirrors Edge soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05wiQQbFLU) is perfect in my opinion.  




 So i'm Australian and we don't get those here, what do they taste like exactly? 




 Thanks man! I would never have found that haha 




 This is my theory at least, I feel that AI hasn't necessarily gotten less complex but we as players have been given a much larger range of skills and moves for us to use in a games which may be above the skill set of A.I enemies. 




 Is it confirmed if Deakins is the DP again for Bond 24? 




 Not sure about programming but Michael Mann's new film Blackhat is about a hacker so that could be interesting since he does a stupid amount of research in films on said subjects.

EDIT here's a [link](http://collider.com/blackhat-comic-con-panel-recap/) on the reasearch he did. 

**As part of his research, Mann started hanging out with some black hat hackers, and discovered that they can do 7 to 8 hours of coding in one go, and it creates both a sense of escapism and a bit of an opiate feedback loop.  But its important to note that its not an escape because their work goes into the real world and can create serious repercussions.

 I dunno I can respect the choreography in Equilibrium but the fight scenes just looked a bit too silly imo   




 Anyone know the song used in the trailer? 




 Man this actually looks badass! The shooting looks awesome. 




 Sorry i'm just a bit bitter that we have to have front plates on our cars haha :/ 




 So I recently rewatched both 28 days and 28 weeks later and was curious as to what you would want to see in a sequel and what direction you could take it in? Do you even think it's possible to make a sequel since it's been so long since 28 weeks and is the market even there anymore? 




 It's obviously not in the USA since it's a right hand drive car...I live in Australia and its against the law to NOT have both plates on. 




 Yeah supposedly he's back to his regular role. 




 He was not the only big name attached to the Counselor... 




 Lets be real, I'm Australian but I would still use my US Netflix account because Foxtel already license the shit out of everything so I can't imagine much content coming to Netflix Au 




 [You were drag racing?](http://youtu.be/Lyw1E8o9o24?t=13s) 




 I've had the privilege of seeing One 77 for real at the Sydney motor show. It truly is amazing in person.  




 Has the soundtrack been officially released? I can't find it anywhere! 




 I actually really liked the 3D in Dredd, definitely one of the better 3D films I have seen.  




 The only things I agree with you were the personality of the robots and the performances from the actors. The pacing however was one of the biggest offenders of the film along side its product placement. The film was pretty much 3 hours long and it did not need to be at all. Just when you think it's almost over...BAM the whole Hong Kong section begins. It did have some cool elements such as the main transformer villain and the dinobots but that was it for me really.  




 While I haven't seen Ninja Turtles yet, I feel that this will probably be true.  




 So guys if Michael Bay really does pass on directing Transformers 5? Who would be your pick to direct and why? 




 So I saw this last night at the movies. I really can't find any discussion on or relating to the film at all, is it not out anywhere else in the world but Sydney, Australia? I quite liked it although I am still trying to wrap my head around the ending and would like an explanation if possible.  




 ICO could be goddamn perfect it studio ghbili make it imo. 




 Even though the story may have been a bit predictable I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The look and sound of the film alone made it one of my my favourite sci fi of 2013.  









 Yes, this scene. I was about 9 or 10 when the film came out and seeing this scene made me really sad and scared! 




 Last I heard, Logan's Run was being written by Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinite's writer/designer, Ken Levine.  




 So I keep hearing on how obesity is considered to be a disease, why don't they just quarantine all fat people until they can contain and cure obesity? 




 In a way I really liked Inside Job since the bankers themselves can kind of be viewed as criminals.  




 OP Do you think you could do my PSN? 




 Looks similar to the [Cyberpunk 2077](http://abduzeedo.com/files/originals/cyberpunk_mainpic.jpg) font, which I also love! 




 Alien 3 was his first feature film and the studio essentially directed that film, he had very little input throughout the production. To his credit the assembly cut of the film actually makes it a decent film and you can see his some of his original vision in it.  




 I have only ever seen one 3GT on the road, it was like spotting some deformed unicorn. 




 We don't talk about that one.  




 Does anyone know the actual story behind this gif? How does someone monumentally fuck up like that, unless they did it on purpose for whatever fucked up reason.  




 The actual film is wrapped and they have quite a lot of effects work to finish off. Special effects can take quite a long time also they showed a small trailer of the film at comic con and the orcs supposedly look amazing for cgi characters.  




 Honestly release it on the PS4, even though I bought the game on PC I felt that the overall population of the game was cut down somewhat by not having it on another platform to build a name brand for itself. Now i'm not saying that was the only problem but they also segregated the community quite early on which lead to it being pretty much dead here in Australia.  




 I always felt that the first part of this fight is awesome. Also that music is just amazing.  




 Fucking hell! That's a lot of dosh!
