 Maybe I didn't say it clearly. In the example the poorer man still has the same income $10, but the richer's man income has nearly doubled $190.  
But that's just a hypothetical example. 




 But that's not how its working.  The wages and incomes of the lower 70% (or so depending on whose numbers you use ) have remained relatively flat for decades, while the incomes of the richest have grown dramatically.  In your example it would be more like the total wealth has grown to 200 , and the rich man is getting $190.  
And honestly do you really think the left 'the left would rather everyone made $15 instead, less for everyone but at least we're equal'.  Why would you think making caricatures out of other peoples opinions is  convincing anyone?  




 God created them in the Garden of Eden.  Don't they teach anything in Bible School anymore? /s 




 The remark was meant as a dig at our politicians (especially the ones who seem to think income inequality isn't a problem and is what those lazy people deserve anyway), not our citizens. But your'e correct, a more engaged citizenry would make something happen much sooner. 




 We've even got Fortune magazine telling us wealth inequality is bad for business.  Maybe somebody should do something. 









 As a nation we have a lot.  You're right though, a small group of people have a whole lot of it. 




 I can hardly believe this is happening in America. We have so much, and we let our kids grow up like this. You should write some more about what you've seen.  More people need to know about it.  




 The company executives, Mr. Berman said in his speech, must be willing to exploit emotions like fear, greed and anger and turn them against the environmental groups. And major corporations secretly financing such a campaign should not worry about offending the general public because you can either win ugly or lose pretty, he said.

My cynicism about lobbyists just took an unexpected jump. 




 True and too bad, because we'd have a much better nation if more of them voted.  




 Depends on where you live, too.  If the Northeast was its own country , it would be pretty respectable in the international rankings.  




 Or get short scheduled so you're not working full time. Or get laid off. Or have a family member that needs help.  Or live in an expensive city, or .. .  




 Poverty persists in America because [real income in the lowest quintile has fallen by 16% over the last 15 years.] (http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Household-Income-Distribution.php ). and that's largely due to wage stagnation.  Talk about government programs failing to solve poverty misses the real cause.  




 Damn that's rough. Good luck in finding the kids.  









 I'm genuinely curious. What percentage your Dad's tax money do you think goes to lazy potheads on welfare?  




 So, for Christ sake young people, do remember to vote.   









 Democrats, regardless of income, see the Republican party as favoring the wealthy -- as do about half of Republicans.

The Vox article doesn't really state this properly. It's probably better to go back to the Washington Post article.

   









 True. But it improves your odds. 
 




 Parental expectations and involvement are the most important ingredient to success in school. (I knew someone whose father was a  massive steelworker who was determined that his children would do well.  She told me there was never any question about doing homework in her house.)  But the isolation of inner city students has a big role in the failure rate and making the schools dysfunctional. I live in a smaller city, not big enough for us to have segregated ourselves too much economically, and all four of our high schools have a significant population of students from impoverished families. (At my kids high school there are students from both the wealthiest part of town and from a couple of rather grim housing projects. ) While the schools have their issues, all of them are reasonably successful and manage to serve economically diverse populations. But that kind of high school has disappeared in most larger urban areas.  Instead we have some schools that serve almost exclusively impoverished students, which clearly has a multiplier effect on the difficulties and discipline issues.  




 I'd agree with some of your statement. Building a nice high school building might make it easier to learn, but it doesn't guarantee successful outcomes.  And unfortunately, far too many lower income families don't understand the need to take schooling seriously. 
But ,
1) High school is too late. Student are far better off going to good elementary schools and a lesser quality high school. What a student brings to high school matters more than the school itself.
2) Isolating the poorer students tends to reinforce the social problems. Of course you're going to see more gang activities in one high school if it's the only school attended by kids who tend to get caught up in gangs. If the staff needs to spend a lot of time on disciplinary and violence issues, there's that much less time and resources for teaching, and more disruption. Students who are not disruptive themselves wind up with less education, through no fault of their own. 
3) The quality of the staff probably matters more than the building.  I know in my town we had one elementary school that was barely functional, until they replaced the principal.  The place still has it's issues, but it's a whole lot better. I obviously have no idea what the staff is like in the schools you mentioned, but I think better teachers tend to avoid the worse schools.

Although I disagree with much of what you've said, I think it's a well written and thoughtful comment. Keep at it.  
 
 




 The goal is to make post secondary education available to everyone, which would include technical or skill training.

 You should write more about your experiences.  Not a lot of people understand that schools for lower income students are chaotic and dismal places.   




 The new American dream will apparently include a large reservoir of cheap, poorly educated, and powerless labor.

 A fair point, but I think the more an idea is repeated, even with dubious sincerity, the more likely it will become part of the public dialogue. 




 Doesn't matter who says it. It's true if it's true.  




 When you include all the taxes (Federal local and state) we all pay, US taxes are not particularly progressive. In fact the top !% play less taxes that the 80-99%.

 Could voter suppression decide the November elections?  




 And when only the wealthy have political rights, the government will only serve their interests. Perfect, no? 




 Yes, because, correctly or incorrectly, they address the subject.  Cato faults the government in dealing with poverty, while ignoring the issue of falling wages and increased inequality.  You can't have a serious discussion about poverty over the last 30 years and leave out those changes. 




 I love these articles by conservative think tanks.  They always skirt around the [biggest reason](http://www.epi.org/publication/top-1-earners-home-20-americas-income/) American poverty has continued  and the [best solution] (http://www.epi.org/publication/increasing-wages-effective-poverty-reduction/). 




 Look no further than Republican attempts across the country to disenfranchise voters and suppress Democratic efforts to register and organize black and brown voters. The fact that the party of organized money thinks the right to vote is worth taking away says that it must be worth quite a lot.

 









 A college major in a subject isn't the professional qualification.  




 They're not economists either, but they somehow seem to all have ready opinions about how to improve the economy.  




 In 2012, Gov. Brownback called his states tax cuts a real live experiment in how tax-cutting affects the budget and the economy. So far, the main result of the experiment seems to be that cutting taxes causes the government to lose revenue.

Let's not rush to judgement. The experiment needs more time before it fails completely. 




 There's nothing better for a nation's long term economic prospects than saving money on education.  




 In the early years of baseball, some managers needed to be in uniform because they were player managers.  




 Although I'm inclined to agree with you, there's some debate about the net effect of illegal labor.  But I've always thought if someone was really interested in ending illegal immigration, they'd crack down on employers as well, which I don't see any Republicans advocating.  What they're doing about illegal immigration is like fighting drug addictions by arresting the addicts and letting the sellers go free. 




 If you're a weenie, everyone seems like a bully.

 Republicans are often perceived as indifferent to working-class struggles (because they sometimes are).

I think he's going easy on the Republicans here. I can't recall anything they've done recently to address working class struggles. Even Rich Lowry (the editor of the National Review) says Republicans aren't addressing middle class issues.    




 Well ,it was a long time ago when I went to the University of Illinois, but I think the ID cards said whether you were a state resident. I haven't heard of any cases of the scenario you describe.  If they had, I'm sure the voter ID advocates would be publicizing them. 




 Ruth Ginsburg, in her dissent on the supreme Court decision,  has a different view about Texas IDs.

Texas will not accept several forms of photo ID permitted under the Wisconsin law the Court considered last week. For example, Wisconsins law permits a photo ID from an in- state four-year college and one from a federally recognized Indian tribe. Texas, under Senate Bill 14, accepts neither. Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Those who lack the approved forms of identification may obtain an election identification certificate from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), but more than 400,000 eligible voters face round-trip travel times of three hours or more to the nearest DPS office.Moreover, applicants for an election identification certificate ordinarily must present a certified birth certificate [which] can be obtained only at significant costat least $22 for a standard certificate sent by mail.

 




 1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud.
2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.    




 There's no better way to illustrate one's advanced maturity and originality than by typing 'Grow the fuck up', is there? 




 OK, Tell me about some legislation the Republicans have passed that contradicts that statement. I can sure find a lot of legislation that supports it. 




 Complement them on their vast and thorough ignorance.  




 I think some do care, but you're largely correct. I don't think Karl Rove spends a lot of time pondering his personal relationship with Jesus Christ. 




 Let's also send everyone a photo id for voting when they turn 18.  Would solve a problem that some people don't really want solved. 




 I've always thought the best indicator emotional maturity was the ability to take responsibility for one's failures and successes.  Which would put Brownback (and our dear, dear Scott Walker here in Wisconsin) at the maturity level of a middle schooler 




 Do you really think we could do better with the Repubs against any change?

A question I would like see posted every time someone complains that 'the two parties are the same' or 'Obama hasn't done enough'. 




 You're incorrectly assuming Republicans want to fix America's problem. Looking at the legislation they've passed over the last 3 decades,  they want a country that serves the interests of a tiny wealthy minority, and impose an evangelical morality on the rest of the population. 




 The magazine did endorse George W. Bush for President. And Bob Dole. And in economics it almost always endorses free trade and lesser regulation. (Though not in this article.)  I was trying to contrast it with the other sources, but I  overstated it. Probably should have left it at centrist.  




 Here's another article favoring minimum wage increases, from a more centrist (if not right leaning) publication.

 But I have never seen a public official lie as easily and as relentlessly as Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback.

Nice work Sam. It's truly difficult to distinguish yourself among this strong  competition.  




 Of course he has affinities to Africa, he was born in Kenya ... wait, have we stopped using that one? 




 Yeah, but that was before he realized what a sweet deal being a Senator is. 




 He is, to be sure, a lucid nut, rather than a raving nut who accosts passersby on street corners.

 I'd put my money on Hillary against the Republican field, but I would never say it just can't happen.  Republicans are improving their ground game and, in the states you mentioned, are doing a pretty good job at voter suppression  




 This article is genuinely hilarious. Republicans score an average of .7 more correct answers in a news poll (about a 6% difference) , and the author is wetting himself because that proves Republicans are better informed than Democrats. And do you notice the article doesn't link to survey?  Wouldn't want people checking the survey for themselves, would you?  




 There's no better investment in Wisconsin than buying a piece of Scott Walker. 




 Because he might be President in 2016. 




 "I don't know the answer to that question," Ryan said. "I don't think science does, either."

This quote from a man who accepts inane economic theories that serve his agenda as fact. 




 I suppose I hardly need point out that Scott Walker is in favor of school vouchers. 









 If you want an example of dissembling and misleading through selective use of the material, you could hardly do better than this article.  Go to the actual [Pew survey](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/02/from-isis-to-unemployment-what-do-americans-know/2/) (which oddly enough, the author somehow overlooked providing a link to), and see if you think the writer is giving a fair representation of the survey.

 So far in this recovery, corporations have captured an unusually high share of the income gains, said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 If a nation reduce worker's bargaining power by eviscerating unions, ignores  wage theft, allows inflation to erode the minimum wage, taxes investment income less than wage income , and reduces the tax rates on the highest incomes, it's made political choices that effect the economy.

 Productivity per worker has greatly increased over the last few decades, profits are high, but wages have been stagnant. If the money was going to increased wages instead of profits, you wouldn't be posing this question.  There's no iron economic law driving the concentration of wealth at the top. It's a political choice.  




 The biggest problem is the concentration of wealth at the top.  Start electing legislators who see that as a problem, instead of something to abet.

Many economists say that, as the economy continues to gradually strengthen over time, the wage picture should improve. 

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is watching the wage issue closely. She has stated the goal of encouraging full employment, with the wage growth that comes with it, even as she also has to watch against the risk of rising inflation.
