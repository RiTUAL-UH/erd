 [This](http://pawvillage.com) website has a huge database of dogs and breeds with some going back to the dogs that were bred to start the breed. Check it out! 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/iJlJahd.jpg) is a picture of our dog with her mother and her siblings. We can trace her lineage back to the founding dogs of the breed, but I understand that white huskies cause confusion. We get people asking us what breed she is all the time! :) 




 From my wife- the raw expert and also a dog trainer: "It varies depending on what sources are available and what version of raw. We do 'Prey Model Raw' and to feed two 40 pound dogs and 2 cats is about $2-3 per day. We get a lot of free meat from hunters as well, and get great deals by buying in bulk from co-ops." Hope this helps! 




 I can't speak for the other dog, since I just met him today, but my dog is raw fed, which helps with their coat. 




 I care. That's my dog! 




 Actually she's a full Siberian Husky from a reputable breeder, registered with the AKC. 




 Yeah, this was taken near Rangewood. Nice pic! 









 Thanks! Hopefully the wait for Fallout goes quickly!
