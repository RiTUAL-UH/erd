 Stellan Skarsgrd has always been my pick for Blofeld.  Waltz always seemed too animated for the role.  Skarsgrd would be perfection.  If anyone is good with Photoshop, feel free to turn this fella into Blofeld...  http://i.imgur.com/OprHZR0.jpg 




 Just the full 5ish seconds from 7:54 to 7:59 where the bear's head tilts with the 'amazement' text over him.  Thank you so much!  High Res would be fun, yes?  or low res?  Maybe both?  I don't know GIFs.

 State the subreddit, then the initiation. 




 1.  Everyone has plenty of time to flee their area as it sinks very slowly, but the land's sinking is non-reversible.  Plenty of time to save movable objects, personal items, relics, certain masonry works, etc.



2.  Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria's lands do not change beyond Jordan acquiring plenty of beach property.



3.  Though the land sinking is a far-fetched, absurd idea, the thought exercise of thinking about the land and the people is an important one.



4.  You can address any issue that comes to mind.  The people, the geo-political ramifications, the refugee statuses, reactions of other countries, the idea of a holy land, Zionism, conspiracy theories, etc, etc.



I ask this question seriously and look forward to you thoughtful answers.  Thank you. 









 I would secure more international financial backing and a firmer distribution strategy before directing it myself the same way that Coppola directed Apocalypse Now and The Godfather.  The script is the book (and radio broadcast transcripts) with my notes in the margins.  CG would be sparse and hidden with purposeful in-camera tricks and props.  Casting would take several months with some favoritism toward lesser known performers of unusual backgrounds (puppeteers, acrobats, interesting speech impediments, etc)  The entire movie would be shot in the UK if possible, though some exteriors may need to be shot elsewhere.  I would hire a towel expert to find me the perfect towel prop.  Absorbent, trustworthy, and intergalactic.   I would film it the way I first envisioned it in my head as an older child.  With all the gloomy bright colors, characters played straight rather than silly, Arthur more as a square always trying to pretend he understands what is going on rather than just a (babel) fish out of water.  He has more depth than just a simple 'where am i?' arc.  I would shoot the film partially on Super 16 Color Reversal Kodak film and other settings of the film in other formats to get different saturations of the different atmospheres.  The UK portions would be filmed in a similar fashion t I, Claudius and the BBC's Hitchhiker miniseries.  I would deaden the contrasts between them a bit as to make it less of a gimmick.   Before shooting, I would bring my script (the book and radio transcripts with my notes) to various accomplished Adams lovers in academia and the acting/writing world and get their take on it.  Holding reading sessions on various scenes with famous improv actors to elicit new takes on the material.  It would be set in the late 70s as well.  Also, i would not take an enormous directorial/writing salary, though I would let my agent work on that.  There is enough material in that little book to make a hell of a funny/intriguing/enchanting/superweird/remarkable movie.  Just need to hire the right people to get my vision onto the screen through a rigorous, well-planned path I have planned.  (Also, may need a mud expert to get that bulldozer mud juuuuust right). 














 Can't trade picks or draftees.  Just five players to add to your roster.  Have fun and show your work. 









 Board game, card game, DVD game, dice game, miniature game, RPG, etc, etc.




Just the absolute worst game that is currently in your collection (however which way you determine what 'worst' means for you).




For kicks, tell us why it's the worst and why you still own it.  Have fun!  :) 




 Key element is you get **one vantage point**.  You're not physically there, but you sense all your surroundings.




For instance, you can be on the grassy knoll during the JFK assassination 2.5 minutes before he's shot ending 2.5 minutes after he's shot.  Basically your senses are there for a **360 degree vantage point experience**.




**You cannot alter history**.  You are intangible, ephemeral, ethereal, and imperceptible.  Think 'Being John Malkovich' but without having to be inside someone's head, and you don't end up on the New Jersey turnpike afterward.




You are just sensing the 5 minutes through sight, sound, smell, taste, temperature, etc from one single point.




The single point can move with a person, object, vehicle, comet, etc.  Your senses are 'harnessed' in relationship to one collection of mass.   For instance, you can be in JFK's motorcade in Dallas, a fixed point in front of Neil Armstrong's helmet that moves with him as he takes his first steps on the moon, or just beside an asteroid as it flies past a distant planet.  




**Thus, mention the specific place you'd be as well as the 5 minute gap.**




Have fun!  (Edited for clarification.) 




 So with Roger Goodell's comments about Los Angeles and London, it made me wonder which other cities might be added in the future.



The NFL could add four more teams and go to three divisions of six teams in each conference, but I love the idea of adding eight more teams to have eight divisions with five teams apiece.  Realistically, eight expansion teams would stretch the NFL quite thin, but it's fun to contemplate the circumstances and invent new teams.



Feel free to move the Jags to L.A., change Buffalo to Toronto, move teams around divisions, change the name of the Washington franchise, or anything else you want.  It's your hypothetical NFL.



If you're feeling extra ambitious, write out the divisions, locations, and team names like this and specify which are newly named, moved, and/or expanded teams...
