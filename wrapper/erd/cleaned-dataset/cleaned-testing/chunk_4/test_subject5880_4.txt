 Sorry, friend. Best of luck. 

Edit:Just to double check and make things clear, I was replying to the user above you. I have no problem with your thread.  




 Fuck yeah, man. Thank you.  




 I really hope for the best for you. You said youve been hospitalized - have you been in behavioral medicine centers/wards of the hospital for therapy?  




 Hi. You might want to take a glance at rule 2 in the sidebar.

 They're underage and they should not have them. I had to sneak my cigs - they can sneak their vape if they so choose to use one.  




 Nicotine will have a peppery / acid reflux type burn feeling on the airways. 24mg was more suited for cheap ego type batteries and clearomizers back in the day - something that produces less vapor in each drag. With that high powered of a setup, you'd probably be good at 12mg/ml. If that is still too rough, try getting an Eliquid that has more VG than PG. Vg is a thicker   smoother liquid, while PG supplies the throat hit.  




 You've obviously never worked at a bank or have any clue what you're talking about.  




 Remember when brand new PS2 games were $20 right when they came out?

 My ass! I've smelled too many rotten chicas, my friend. I recommend these summers eve pH balancing wipes or wash to anyone. I seriously won't even go down there on very many girls anymore.

 Everything. I don't have sympathy for anything, because I have empathy for it all. I am the king of feels, and I always feel all that there is to feel.

 I didn't know Vape Dojo was on here! You guys supplied my first vape with the original Kanger Evod kit! 

I'd take 3mg! 




 Test was performed by Lorillard, the tobacco company (owned by Reynolds American, who are against anything that isn't a cartomizer), who manufactures Blu.

The experiment uses:

Three blu eCigs products (approximately 50% of the US market) and two SKYCIG products (approximately 30% of the UK market) were chosen for evaluation. Marlboro Gold Box (US), and Lambert   Butler Original and Menthol products (UK),

Not really relevant to our products, but good for their marketing and FDA approval.  




 Understood. Thank you much, Smog, for the quick reply. I'll stick around and wait for an update on shipping from you.  




 From VapeNW also? 




 I paid for mine on 1/19 :\\. I hope they weren't late for making the order, because that's pretty early. 




 So we've seen that the iStick 50w has seen some massive delays, from Jan 26th to possibly early March. 

However, on /r/electronic_cigarette, I've discovered that a [few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2vnplb/my_mvp_20_died_after_one_year_of_solid_vaping_i/cojjuk6), one who even ordered just 2 days ago, already have the iStick 50w in hand, from [vapeNW](http://vapenw.com/istick-50w-by-eleaf). [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com/eleaf-istick-50w-battery/) also has them in stock, as does [OriginVape](https://originvape.com/product/eleaf-istick-50w/). 

Is there any update to the date that we should expect our iStick 50w's? I was sort of expecting that through this group-buy we'd be some of the first to get the product - but it's already on shelves elsewhere. 




 Thank you, much. I'll have to ask my distributor about this. I was able to preorder mine for only $39 including shipping, but he said that no products would be send out until way after Chinese New Year. 




 Dammit. I must've pre-ordered in the wrong place. That's frustrating. Where did you pre-order yours?  




 No way. Where did you buy it from?  




 Istick 50w is supposed to reach the states by ~~March 5th~~ **now I guess**. It's original release date was January 26th,and it's been pushed back 3-4 times.  




 I enjoy Big Bang Theory. I wouldn't watch it on my own, but the people where I live watch it at dinner, and I enjoy the newest episodes. 

I now really dislike Whitney for having produced this crap show, so I'll be giving that about as much attention as I give "the Chrisleys"  




 The most unfunny show I have ever seen in my life. Cringefest.  




 Hey OP. If you have the time for a good read, please take a look at my latest college paper. My college research topic was electronic cigarettes, and I spent a huge deal of time looking through information, scientific experiments, and professional opinions on this topic. [Here is the link to my final course paper,](https://www.mediafire.com/?5ev46znw9etboyk) it's in Microsoft Word compatibility format. I think it will answer a lot of your questions, and the work's cited page will include sources for all of the data I am representing. 




 The film on my car is so bad that at night, all of my windows and the windshield freeze on the inside. Even driving for 40 minutes with the defroster on full blast will not remove the frozen film. When it's not that cold out, my windows are constantly fogged up - even in the rear. I never vape with closed windows - the drivers side window is always open no matter how cold, and the defroster is permanently on in my car while driving. I took rags with rubbing alcohol and windex out to rub all my glass down, but no success.  




 Thank you very much!  




 Hey, this is nsfw 




 How can I downgrade to a previous version? Is there a site where I can find a previous version of the apk to push to my phone? 




 A few of my guesses were within 2 miles, but then the site crashed on round 5/5 :((((((

 The way I see it, 263,000 kids who would have smoked picked up a vape instead and are still nonsmokers.  




 Agreed. And old band of mine used to cover the song and it's very fun to play.

 Puddle of Mudd when they are live. Wes, the singer, is always drugged out and completely unconnected from the crowd at every concert. He stands in the middle of the stage stuck to the microphone in dirty beat up clothes and sings quietly with his hair in his face, annunciating none of the words correctly.

 Pretty sure you are one of Eciggity's many vote manipulation accounts.  




 I've seen some mis-shipped items and from black Friday to Christmastime a lot of mischarges totaling huge sums, but customer service is usually pretty nice and fast. I've only had one argument with one person, otherwise they pay for return shipping and get on it fast. 

[Here's the run-in I had.] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2m5km4/horrible_customer_experience_with_eciggity/?sort=confidence)  




 Also a good point. 




 I find it neat that you replace batteries for $25! If I weren't poor I'd pick this thing up real fast!  




 I wonder if the atomizer was rainbowed before or after the explosion.

 Thank you for pointing this out.  




 Yeah, downvoted the post due to trying to prove a point and not answering simple questions regarding it.  




 It wouldn't ruin smogs reputation, my friend. They delayed from Jan 25th to March 6th 




 How did you choose vaping? It seems like you still took her to dinner and then home without breaking things off with her. Outside of my love for vaping, she sounds like someone I would've gotten rid of, or at least turned around the car and dropped her back off at home. Sucks, man - you never win with a woman.

 These are all great answers, but I think we've forgotten the point of not staring at your interviewers breasts.  




 I think you're done with real reddit for today. Head over to /r/circlejerk or /r/montageparodies. 




 You have nothing to be sorry about! I understand the question and it's thought provoking. Just clearing it up for a fellow redditor out of the loop 




 Not weird at all, my friend. That's why it's growing exponentially in popularity. If you feel interested in looking for a setup, you can let me know, or check out /r/electronic_cigarette (hit or miss nowadays). I've done quite a bit of research on electronic cigarettes, and from what I've seen from the data, its a much healthier alternative. My bronchi tells me otherwise after about a year and a half, but I have yet to prove that it's due to vaping, and it seems to be a very isolated experience that I'm having. 

It IS, however, trading an addiction for another if you choose to use nicotine(all Eliquids also come in nicotine free versions!) - but I truly enjoy it and it's a much more manageable addiction due to the ability to fully customize your nicotine intake.  




 if you have too much, you'll just feel uncomfortable for a couple hours. 

Depends on the person. As someone who used to struggle with an anxiety disorder, I actually managed to have a really bad trip that screwed me up for quite some time. 

About 50% of my trips would be bad, the longest being 3.5 hours. Actually tried ending my life the next day. 

Now I'm all good though. Blaze on. 
 




 Love the taste, actually.  




 Vapes, for sure. It seems every time I get stoned or drunk it's all people want to talk to me about.  




 No. You have to tell everyone on reddit to not give you gold. 

Edit: thanks for the gold

 Great question. I was thinking about asking the same one. It's always funny hearing a commercial start off, "I'm raising money" and then immediately go to the next commercial. Kinda just like, oh, that's nice. 

Hope this gets answered. My only idea is that the company stopped paying the channel and this is a legal way for the channel or TV provider to require the company to keep paying without actually/fully advertising for them. Just a guess.  




 It helps to just ignore it. A fraction of people in every community everywhere just suck. 




 White Knight  




 Does it still say that somewhere? I can't find it. Last I heard from Smog it was late Feb/early March. If it got finalized to 3/5 that's kinda a super bummer. 




 Where I come from, even as a white teenager I used to get followed around stores and kicked out all the time. It's disgusting, but I've had a laugh like this as well :).

It's just a thing  




 What I did is just cut up a tiny bit of my pill and take it whenever the zaps were too hard to handle. I came off of 300mg of [effexor] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=antidepressant+with+worst+withdrawal oq=antidepressant+with+worst+withdrawal+ aqs=chrome..69i57.8407j0j4 sourceid=chrome-mobile espv=1 ie=UTF-8) very very quickly and this method was very effective for me. Effexor also has a very short half life so it killed the withdrawals quickly, so it might be different in your situation.

 The problem with the original istick 20w is that it will only fire coils whose resistance measures out to equal to or greater than 1 ohm. If it's anything like my 12w MVP v2.0, it isn't powerful enough to fire dual coils, either. Another person recommended the istick 50w. They are expected to be released in late February or early March, but their release has already been delayed twice. I'm still getting one, but just be ready for a wait. I would not recommend a aspire Cf subohm battery to replace the istick, as they are not similar in any way. The aspire battery has one button to push to fire, no variable voltage. It's like a beginners mechanical mod, essentially. 

I think the istick 50w IS going to be great, and I recommend waiting for it if you have the patience, unless you can trade in your 20w istick for the newer 30w which fires sub ohm coils. 

If you like the idea of a Lemo drop on a 30w istick, my friend just purchased this setup and I can send you pictures of how the tank fits on the istick. They are made by the same company, designed for the istick, so it should look good.  




 Sure thing!  




 Hang in there, friend. It's one of the roughest things to deal with, but it gets better in time. 




 Yes....
