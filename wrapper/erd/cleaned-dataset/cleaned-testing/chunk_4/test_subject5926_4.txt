 [Well here you go] (http://myanimelist.net/animelist/nexxy) 




 Unfortunately didnt help. 




 Hello everyone,
sooo I have this problem with pop-out windows all of them have [THIS] (http://imgur.com/D13f8Zb) weird kind of visual bug.  
I tried to disable all addons (also deleted and redownloaded them again) and I ran the scan and repair in launcher. I would rather not reinstall the whole game, so Im asking if anyone has some experience.  
Sorry if this doesnt belong here and also thanks for all the responses. 




 you get it if you level up your compendium to lvl 150 




 Im gonna go with TTGL, maybe its beacuse of the situation I was in when i started watching but it helped me to feel so much better and every time i hear [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6LFOIofRE) i gotta start singing too.  
ROWROW FIGHT DA POWA!

 yeah i have to agree- the power of friendship beacuse we run out of   source matreial is just sad. But the part stickin to manga is really  
well done and the manga was actually one of the best thing i ever read.
