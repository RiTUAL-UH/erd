 In June of 2014 I was on the verge of needing medication to cope with job anxiety.  I was six months pregnant.  It was hot outside.  My former company forced me to go on two last business trips before I left for good in August.  I was salaried and working about 56 hours a week.  I'm really glad it's not June of 2014.  




 OMG... the parallels!  I read and knit... My husband shaves his head, right?  I joked that he was basically Nostferatu once... He did not like that at all.  Ahahaha, this is such a small world.  Thank you for the comment. 3   




 Someone is going to click on this and wonder what the hell happened.  Ahahaha.  




 I try to be a good wife.  I pre-ordered [this](http://store.misfit.com/products/bolt?gclid=CjwKEAjwqLWrBRC-_OaG-IfL0kASJAAbzKsVbpRky11625fR9yZLmpV-PYcJf4H17n_Ui0fOQ2pUhRoC-dvw_wcB) for him for his birthday... I think it was the most successful gift I've ever given in my life.   




 I like your spirit!  However, I'm married (and not to cabinet maker, to someone who can't hold a screwdriver) so my cabinet acquiring days outside of the Home Depot are over. :(  Such is life.  




 When they legalize polygamy in one of our countries, we'll make it happen.  




 Until you wrote this, I had no idea that melatonin had to do with circadian rhythm function... You might be on to something.... he never comes to bed on time.  Basically, if this were Harvest Moon for SNES, he would be abandoned by now.    




 In our old apartment, if I needed to see something properly, I had to go into the bathroom.  It was the only room in the whole house he never tampered with.  




 Well, your comments are awesome, I upvoted a ton of them, but sorry cool kid from the UK, I'm married.  It's okay, though, I'm sure I'm too old and possibly too short for your anyhow.  




 He hates being in a properly lit room.  I'm forever coming home to find all the lightbulbs have been switched to the colored kinds that don't actually throw light.... It's very frustrating to turn on a lamp and have things not get brighter.  It's also annoying to leave the room to take a leak and come back to find all the lights have been turned off.  All my houseplants are dying because of the black-out curtains.  

I'm not making this up.  This is a real point of contention in my marriage.  




 Well, this did make me laugh out loud, and that's always a plus. ;) 




 Probably a cabinetmaker.  That would indicate to me that a man is precise, patient, intelligent, perfectionistic, artistic, strong, handy, and focused.   




 If money can't buy happiness, you don't know where to shop! ;) 




 That buzz of connection when you talk to someone and they understand you and you understand them.  It's the opposite of loneliness.   









 This is very hard to put into words because it's not logical in any way, shape, or form.  It's an anxiety behavior for me.  I see a text (especially from someone who makes me uncomfortable like my mother in law) and I don't know what to say.  I agonize over it for a moment.  Come up with nothing.  Get illogically angry at the sender for putting me in this situation, set it aside.  Remember at a later time, fret that too much time has passed for a normal response... continue to do nothing..... I actually cut my former boss out of my life completely just because I never knew what to say to her and couldn't force myself to guess what she might've meant. 




 His mother.  You NEVER criticize an SO's family to your SO.  They will take it personally and it accomplishes nothing. 




 "Where is my Mind" by the Pixies reminds me of the Tracey Fragments.  When they released the film, they did a promo where they released all the raw images to be re-mixed by fans.  Someone did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjY7xD6W24) awesome reFragment as it was called.  They did a better job than the movie in a lot of ways!  




 My sister had a car she had totaled twice.  I was driving the damn thing around with the steering wheel airbag compartment and the glove box held shut with zip-ties.  My stepdad had cut the airbags out with a carpet knife, so they were just these raggedy tatters you saw peeping out behind the zip-ties.  I didn't really care, I mean, it got me from point A to point B for much longer than I would have thought it could. :) 

Edit: I finally remembered the name of it!  It was a '96 Ford Contour.   




 This kid and I went out for breakfast.  He made no effort to make conversation and his answers to my questions were monosyllabic or brooked no discussion.  The one that took the cake was when I asked him what kind of music he liked and he said "Don't really like music.  There was a Greenday song that was alright."

WELP.  I guess I'll see you around...  




 Well, it was my understanding that Brits had an even larger tendency towards modesty than we did, but I could be wrong.  It's to do with the fact that we don't like to admit that we have to eliminate waste bodily.  See what I did there?    




 Be awkward and malnourished.  I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type.  I like 'em hungry looking.  




 Killer Mike has a song for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU 




 I'd like to point out that in my experience "taking a leak" is something men do.  I like to say it as a female, and I almost always get derisive laughter when I do.

We call it a restroom because we don't have bath tubs at work, so it's not a bathroom! :) 




 WOW.  That sub-comment.  Really though, I don't wear leggings with anything but a dress, HOWEVER, I can give you my guess.  Our hips are shaped in a way that is not super conducive to comfortable pants.  Add to this the trend that jeans need to be tight, the comeback of the highwaist, and the fact that all work pants are miserable, it's likely just a comfort thing.  We can't put things in our tiny pockets anyway, so we're not really missing function by ditching them.  




 I think probably by sending their nudes to their place of employment.... Or maybe by kidnapping your child and disappearing... really anything that not only ends the relationship, but also ruins the rest of your life.  




 I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys.  Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process.  

Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified.     




 100% down hill, no other answer.  Walking UP the hill relieves the pressure on your feet.  Going down you feel like you're going to topple over and lose your shoes!  




 I was a pretty literal child.  I had a constant fear of not being able to accomplish a directive my mother had given me.  So when she told me that I was to keep my hands folded in my lap and be still, I was very concerned about the fact that my hands didn't seem to want to fold.  

I was also TERRIFIED when a babysitter told me if I didn't do something I would be "dead meat."  I thought she was going to kill me and put me in the freezer.  




 It's okay... when I was four I told my mom I wanted to be an artist.  She told me that artists don't get paid anything until they were dead and so I needed to be more realistic.  Flash forward to a year later, I attended my first funeral and decided I wanted to be like the friendly mortician I met there.  This lasted until I was about 14.  I hope you laughed at this, I was trying to cheer you up.  (But I'm also 100% serious.)

Edit: I totally said I wanted to be a mortician in more than one school publication in the local newspaper.  Ha ha, mom.  




 I know that feel, man.  For me it was my mother.  She also told me that if a group of people don't like you, because there are more of them than there are of you, they must be seeing something you are doing wrong and have a valid point.  You and I will forever second guess ourselves, but at least we will almost certainly survive any crisis since we're constantly imagining the worst possible scenario at any given time. ;) 




 My sister and I have the same nightmare... if we see a swing or a tether ball or anything else that hangs from something, you can bet we're going to end up swinging wildly around in the sky while we panic.  It's quite awful...  




 You know, there is an exchange about this very thing in the dystopia movie "Antiviral."  In it, they sell cloned meat made from the DNA of celebrities.  Syd Winter says to Arvid "I still don't understand how this isn't cannibalism."  Arvid replies that the current popular opinion is that what makes us human is more spiritual than physical.  Our soul in other words.  




 It's commonly believed that it means one of two things:

You're afraid of your own mortality.  Teeth are a sign of power and health.  You lose both as you age.

You said something you wish you hadn't. 




 Uncomfortable.  You have to understand that your outward appearance is hardly an accomplishment that says anything about what kind of person you are.  Just like having dimples or a big pregnant belly, being beautiful makes people think you're public property in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  You owe people things, people get defensive more easily, you're not taken as seriously.   




 Yes, my astonishment at the fact that a huge part of my job was reformatting things in Microsoft Word and ghost writing e-mails for people with three more college majors than me was quite great.   




 Almost anything they sell in an infomercial.  If you want to laugh until you cry, go to Amazon and read the reviews for the MyPillow and the NoNo hair remover.  




 [Thank you for being a friend.](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150420/golden-girls-01-800.jpg) 




 It is like this: you put in at least 1% and after 1 year they will match 5% OF YOUR SALARY.  At the 5 year mark it jumps to 10% OF YOUR SALARY.... Can you even believe that people still decline participation?  It blows my mind!  

I've decided that I have to stay here at least until my daughter stops needing daycare (and I can divert 20% into my Roth 401k), no matter how brain dead it's making me.  




 It's a really stupid story involving my younger sister and the Simon and Garfunkel cover of "My Little Town."  A totally inane story that I never get sick of telling anyone who has ever met my sister.   




 I told my friend about the retirement matching in my company (it's mind-bogglingly good), and he got very excited for me.  Then he made a comment about how we must officially be adults since this is what we're congratulating ourselves on. ;) 




 Well, because you can learn a lot from fiction as well.  A lot of people are not able to apply third person narrative to their lives... it's too abstract and objective and lacks feeling.  When you are reading fiction from a first person perspective, you become that person.  Learning isn't just about facts and figures, it's also about having compassion and learning not to judge everything at face value.  I hope this helps you! :)  




 In high school I had hair down to my hipbones that I pretty much never brushed and I tended to wear a minimum of three shirts... yes, like a homeless person.  When I graduated high school, I cut off all my hair into a pixie cut and moved to a place where it was too hot to pretend to be Rivers Cuomo.  I started working at a Gamestop.  I got phone numbers daily.  Boys would hand me things and "accidently" touch my chest.  My assistant manager printed movie labels he trimmed as commentary for our name tags... I got "The Hot Chick."  

Now, I suspected then that I might be cute, but figured it was more like I was a skinny 6/10 with boobs who played video games.  It wasn't until Tiny Chat that I realized I was regarded as actually beautiful.  When strangers on the internet start hiding all cams but yours and taking screenshots, you just have to wonder.  It wasn't until someone who I literally think is a 10 asked me out of jealousy what it was like to have everyone vying for my attention that I was like maybe I'm missing something here.  

I don't treat anyone differently, I'm just now all the more anxious because it's one more thing that isn't how I think it is. 




 IS MONOPOLY MONEY OKAY???? :D :D :D 




 Yessss, I will take three Quarter Pounders with cheese... oh, and can I get a diet Coke with that? ;)  




 I think we can all relate to not having anything to say to certain people, right?  I've never really made fun of someone for their height, but I'm uncommonly short (just under 5'), and I don't think people do it very seriously.  They're just trying to get my attention and not very clever!  What I think is more obnoxious is how if you tell them this is not clever or original, you're the bad guy... hahaha! 

tl;dr: We can't talk about the weather all the time. 




 I'm not going to type out a huge long story, but my worst boyfriend used to use me as an excuse to get out of things he didn't want to do.  He would lie to his family and work about me being super controlling or about cruel things I apparently said so he wouldn't have to see them or work.  It took me a long time to work out what was going on.  If his mother weren't such a direct person I probably never would have... she called me out on things I had "said" and I felt like the floor fell out from under me!

Yeah, he was a bit crazy, I'd say.  




 I've read that it takes 1 year for your stomach muscles to go back to pre-pregnancy shape if they didn't damage during the late pregnancy.  My stomach looks normal until I eat something.... when I get bloated my stomach is round like I'm 4 months pregnant.  This is hilarious (in a sad way) since I'm down to 107 lbs (I'm just under 5'), but I'm sure it'll pass.  I don't think the droop goes anywhere though.  At least we're in good company! :) 




 Good: Be random.  I have a very abstract sense of humor, I like people who can hang. :)

Bad: Pouting.  I can't handle pouting.  Don't pout.   




 You can't win 'em all. ;) 




 Right, I used to tell people I was named after the "CALL ATT girl," but I haven't made that joke in years since no one has CALLED ATT in a very long time ;) 




 http://i.imgur.com/oReaT.jpg This one made me laugh my ass off.  Relevant!  




 I like it! :) 




 Using a card catalogue.  Guys, have you gone back and checked what World Book had to say about the solar system in 1992?  That shit is hilarious!  This is how we used to educate ourselves?!   




 When my mother said "Maybe it's time to switch to a less reliable form of birth control."   




 If you do not eviscerate all of the children under the age of five within the next hour, we will nuke your entire town.  

I have neighbors.  They know I have a baby... how the hell do I get her out?  Terrifying.  




 Tom Arnold. 




 And I remember my social studies teacher telling us about people using a wheelbarrow to transport all the cash they needed to buy a single loaf of bread in Russia!  Inflation!  It's real! :)  




 There's a lot of shame for physical issues/conditions that are gender specific.  People don't want to hear about lochia or episiotomies or yeast infections.  I'm trying to think of something a guy could bring up that would cause a similar immediate reaction of distaste or disgust, and I'm coming up short.  I was familiar with the term "pre-mature ejaculation" before I reached my adult height!   




 Name the Wind.... My best friend told me it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, but I'm just like son of a bitch, I'm sick of these spiders...  




 I actually think it must just be poor context.  The only context of this word that I've ever heard that stuck with me was when it was used in those mid-90's Duncan Heines commercials... Moist is totally something I like in a cake.  Now congeal?  Or coagulate? PASS ON THAT.   




 Did you know that in 1920 the average cost of a house was a hair under $4,000?

Obviously if we all got $1,000,000 the inflation would kill our economy and while I'm not quite sure what the worldwide aftershock would be, I'm sure it would be horrifying.  




 This is why I volunteer with a hospice!   




 No, but it's for a totally practical reason: That would wreck the pH in our little lady environments.  I mean, lots of things do, but hell, let's not totally throw reason out the window here... If that wasn't a concern, I'd totally be down. 




 Well, this is irrelevant now being that she is too old to be president realistically... but for awhile there I was hoping Arnold would succeed in his bid to have the constitution amended to allow foreigners who have had US Citizenship for x number of years to be eligible for presidency so that Madeline Albright could have run.  It didn't happen, but she's the person I would have wanted leading my country in 2000.    




 Oh my god, you guys.  Upvotes for everyone.  Thanks for making me cry laughing in my office. 

Contribution so this isn't just a useless post: raisins.  I can't imagine eating raisins could ever be sexy in an unironic way.  




 I think it depends on whether you bought one on impulse or if you're a serious quantified lifer.  I know a kid who has been using his Jawbone to create sophisticated Excel charts that cross reference all kinds of crazy things.  It's pretty much his favorite hobby.  He's been doing it for years! 




 Anytime you have to have what my former boss called "the smelly kid conversation."  Nothing is more awkward than setting someone down and telling them their coworkers are concerned because you don't seem to shower, use deodorant, or change your clothes.

I've had to have this chat with three employees and I've sat in as a second for many, many more.  Remember kids, don't ever have this or a conversation about dress code without a witness.  




 My anxiety makes it very scary for me to think about watching movies I haven't seen before with other people, and if they have already seen the movie, it ratchets that anxiety up to 11.  I know this probably sounds really silly, but it's a thing.  Your friend could be coming from the same place.  It's worth considering.

The last time I had to see a movie with friends, I read the novel and another film adaptation of the source material to "prepare," I haven't seen a movie with friends in almost four years! 




 Well, sometimes you can't do anything that's obvious, you know?  He clearly loves you and trusts you to tell you about it.  He might not ever mention it again, and that's fine.  If he wants help, he'll probably ask for it.   When a sexual abuse occurs, the person involved feels powerless and out of control.  One very subtle way you can help your father is to ask to do things with him that he's really good at and that you're only so-so or bad at.  I can't give you a great example, but say he is a master fisherman.... ask him to take you fishing, ask questions, thank him for teaching you if you think it won't embarrass him. 

I don't want to give you advice about how to handle your uncle, because every family dynamic is different and there are a few factors.  I guess the best advice I can give is to remember what you know and use that knowledge to sort of keep an eye out for any other potential victims.  Intervene in a subtle way when appropriate.  

I'd be happy to talk about this further if you want.  Just shoot me a PM. 




 This is just like Batman vs. Superman.  OF COURSE the ants will win, they are ants... Just like Superman is an ALIEN.  Batman and humanity can only hope to get a few shots in with our expensive toys and our wits, but we all know it's just a matter of time...  




 Well, judging by the films made in the 70's that were set in the future, I think it would be hard to believe that smoking became LESS prevalent, not more!    




 I don't know what you all are talking about... my mom makes mom jokes all the time... they're like this: "Well, you can do what you want to do... BUT YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ;)"  or  "I know you think I'm stupid, so you'll just do what you want..."  It's a joke because no matter what you do, you're screwed.  All you can do is laugh... until you cry.  




 I actually never had any.  I was tempted to lie since people took this as license to have a very long and stupid conversation about their disbelief that this was the actual case.  When you're that pregnant, you don't want to have the same unoriginal conversation every two hours.  I also got tired of people coming to my office and saying "You're still here!"  YES, OBVIOUSLY.  




 I got a breadmaker for Christmas one year.  I was trying to make bread a week later and I couldn't find my half-cup measure anywhere.

I asked my husband about it.  He said he "maybe, might have thrown it away, but can't remember exactly..."  I was understandably annoyed and told him it would be very difficult to make bread without it since you have to be so precise for things to turn out well.

An hour later he came into the house from outside with the measuring cup and said to me "Look!  It's a New Year's Miracle!"  




 I blitzed through the "His Dark Materials" trilogy in a weekend.  If you're asking for the purpose of school, I recommend it purely on the basis that there are a lot of topics in it that make for great essays.   




 Something that I really like is when a guy is handy.  If you can do car repairs or build things it indicates to me that you have a natural curiosity about the world and that you're pragmatic.  Handy guys who spend a lot of time out in their garages also don't tend to be co-dependent.  They know the value of personal accomplishment.  That is a beautiful thing! :) 




 No screen time before (and definitely not in) bed.  Go to bed a bit earlier than you need to fall asleep (I like an hour), and read.  I like to read things I'm interested in, but are unarguably a bit boring like novels by Thomas Hardy or Jane Austen.  They are great to sleep to.  You don't want to have coffee or other caffeinated drinks within 8 hours of your bedtime.  Don't exercise before bed.  It can be helpful to start a night-time ritual, like taking a shower, putting on your pajamas, turning off all the lights in your house in a certain order, reading for a half hour.  Studies show that our bodies respond to memory of ritual and you will begin to get tired during step one after your body begins to correlate that you only shower before you sleep...it also lowers your body temp, which makes you tired.  Invest in a white noise machine (not a sound machine).  Be active while you're awake.    




 This actually reads very nicely to me.  My only comment is that if this person is going to be a supervisor you may want to focus more on things that make a good supervisor (constantly developing personally, sensitive to the needs of others, hardworking, innovative, diplomatic) and a tiny bit less on their great deal of heart (for lack of a better term). You don't want him to seem too emotional for the job, and let's face it, a lot of people can't do supervisor work for just that reason.  You get pretty beat up!  




 After I had my baby, I tried to go back and play the Sims 3 one day... I managed to snatch an uninterrupted hour (a miracle) and accomplish decorating half a Sim house (read: absolutely nothing accomplished).  It put into perspective that I had probably dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into video games.

It's good that you would like to go out and do things, and therein lies your opportunity to meet like-minded folks.  Now you're probably going to find that at a wine-tasting there's going to be a lot of 40-something soccer moms that zone out when you try to speak to them, just don't give up.  Eventually you will find someone in your various activities that will jump at the chance to do other fun things with you.  

You're right about body image, it starts on the inside.  If you're serious about bulking up, there is a lot of science and theory to be had, which will appeal to your intellectual side.  I recommend you look into intermittent fasting in muscle building.  It will challenge everything you have been brought up to believe about eating. 

If you really have anxiety, you will probably always struggle with it to some degree.  I'm high-functioning, but still very high anxiety.  I will notice little innocuous things I'm doing, like putting off a phone call and then have to talk myself up in my head to stop that behavior.  The key to avoiding missed opportunities due to anxiety is to just question your negativity.  Try to see things from another angle.  If you think "Wow, this person is really rude... they must not like me. :(" Take a step back and think about the last time you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person.  You probably can't come up with one, because that's not really how we function as human beings.  That other person is the same as you and probably meant no harm.  

I hope this helps you! :) 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q72cK8MyEUk 3:00 to see Johnny Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls talking about wearing a dress around his apartment in the 80's.   




 Drizzt Do'Urden 




 White ratty gym socks with pants that are just a hair too short.  




 Hard to argue with happiness, I suppose, but man... how awful. ;) 




 I have a cousin whose middle name is "T," as in just a letter, nothing longer.  Apparently "T" is the first initial of his mother, his father, both uncles, and I think a few other people besides.  She couldn't think of who to honor, so she left it open to interpretation.  




 Aw snap, here we go.  The first time my mother met this old dude next door, he was walking around with bread bags tied over his shoes... he was phobic of dog feces. 

He told her that he used to work, but didn't because he had a total meltdown and ended up in a mental institution for five years. 

He used to randomly fire his hunting rifle into the woods behind our houses from his deck.  Not aiming, just firing.  

He didn't play the radio, because it transmits the sound from your house to the government.  

One time my mom was watching birds in the backyard with her binoculars.  There was Milt... watching her with binoculars from his yard.

We were under strict orders to never talk to him alone.   




 Peppermint Schnapps.  Listen guys, don't ever play a drinking game like "Never Have I Ever" with Peppermint Schnapps.  It's been 7 years and thinking about it still makes me gag.  




 Eating more than five olives in one sitting will give you an amazingly painful stomach ache.  Apparently my mother was very passionate about keeping the olives in the house.   




 Black Hills Energy was the only utility company that I ever encountered that treated their customers as their number 1 priority, and I have encountered a lot of utility companies in my former profession.  Would recommend/10.  




 After I put in my two weeks at Gamestop, I just like, gave no fucks.  The best time was when this kid came in.  I greeted him, as was required.  He ignored my greeting.  Pretended to look around, then made his way back to me to turn in a job application.  I said "Let me get this straight.... you want me to give you a job, but you didn't even return my greeting?  You do know that greeting people is, like 30% of this job right?"  He was actually a sport and said "Oh man! I didn't know I was at a pre-interview, how can I convince you?  Do I still have a shot?" I said it depended and what did he know about video games?  He proceeded to reveal that the only game he had ever played ever was Megaman on SNES.  You better believe I slapped a do-not-bother post-it on that application.  No regrets, I'm 100% sure he didn't want to do what I was doing for the pitiful wage of $5.15/hr.  He dodged a bullet and didn't even know it.  




 Get yourself one of these puppies: http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Baby-Food-Grinder-Light/dp/B000GB0NZA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432999738 sr=8-1 keywords=food+grinder+baby

Mix it with other things once it's the texture of mashed potatoes if you don't just want to cook it with garlic and olive oil and eat it like that. :) 

Brocoli is pretty much a super food, so I get it!  I'd also try it a few other ways... like is it raw that bothers you?  Just cooked?  Heads? Stems?  Identify what bothers you, and try to work around it.  Good luck, friend!  




 Have you tired /r/kindvoice or /r/needafriend ?  Both tend to have offers all the time with a/s listed.

I'm too old for you, or I'd offer. :) 




 Not to sound like I'm wearing a tin-foil hat here, but a number of things I've noticed went hay-wire on the internet on Memorial Day.  I think the government knows why and possibly were involved while we all celebrated what Facebook tells me isn't national barbecue day.   




 List action:

What's that got to do with the price of salt?
Variation: What's that got to do with the price of tea in China?

You get more bees with honey than you do with vinegar.

I pinned her ears back.

I'm snug as a bug in a rug.

Your eyes are bigger than your belly.

I've got to go so bad my eyeballs are floating.

You make a better door than a window.

Tough tittie said the kittie, but the milk's still good. (Variant: the milk's still free.)

All the grace of a newborn elephant.

I'll be there with bells on.

You're fine? Fine as frog's fur? 




 Absolutely, man.  There could be something bigger at play here... like a company reorganization or the company being purchased by a parent company.   




 Thank you for using "tall poppy syndrome" which prompted me to google what that means, which informed me there is a word for a thing that I see all the time!  I'm going to be speaking much more efficiently now! :) 




 mfw it is already happening.  We're expelling carbon dioxide.  If we don't, we die.  Did I just break your time-space continuum?  Tell me, bby.  




 Right, I'm not going to name names here, but a very large utility was paying their direct hires $35.00/hr to take phone calls, while they paid only $16.99 per dedicated hour for our agents to take the same calls.  (We paid these agents about $8.50/hr)  As one of the other contributors pointed out, pay differential aside, they didn't need to cover any benefits for us.  They also weren't spending money on coaching.  All of that was on our dime, so they had the freedom to mandate we meet certain goals, save themselves money while we worked with the agents, and ultimately leave if we didn't deliver.   There is a reason why these numbers are normally private and thus why you would be confused.   




 I think it's quite beautiful to recognize that you're young at heart and to be young for as long as you can be.  I mean, we're only getting older, you'll never get the chance again.  

I think you just need to do some things that make you feel smart and competent.  For me, that is traveling.  I never feel as smart and free and independent as I do when I'm in an airport.  When you travel alone, you can indulge in your childlike wonder at the world around you.  You can be you without thinking yourself to death the way you do when you're just home alone.  

It's good to think the best of people and to be curious about them.  That alone will get you far as many people love to talk about themselves.  If you ask questions, typically you don't need to worry about expressing yourself too well, because the other person will go on a bit.  While I can be a chatty Kathy (obviously) I'm intrinsically curious about why people do what they do and how and what they feel about it.  So while I am largely awkward, having met my best friend at 23, a lot of people consider me to be their friend merely on merit that I've asked them things and listened to their answers and remembered little things about them. 

The wonderful thing about being a human being is that if we don't like our circumstances, there is rarely a situation where we can't change them completely.  I totally encourage you to think about the things you like to imagine you are brave enough to do and to just do them.  No one ever lies in their deathbed and says "I wish I had spent more time worrying and waiting to start my life," right?  Be brave and be you and do everything you want to do.  You deserve it.  You only live in this wonderful world once. :) 




 I'll chime in again, hey, why not.  Another thing my husband gets a lot is the description that he looks like Mr. Clean.  

What?  My husband is 160 lbs soaking wet at 6'2"... he's not a ripped old man in a small t-shirt.  He also doesn't have bushy white eyebrows or blue eyes or a killer tan.  He doesn't have a pierced ear and he doesn't wear jeans.... Are you saying he's bald?  Yes.  He happens to be bald.  




 I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time.  I can't speak about your culture and I won't presume to, but you asked if it was true whether no matter where a man is from, he'd be bothered.  The answer to that is no.  I'm an American.  I did not come into my marriage as a virgin.  My husband could not care less.  

I hope things get better for you.  Please feel free to PM me if you're ever lonely and need a sympathetic ear.  You are more than your currency as a potential mate.
