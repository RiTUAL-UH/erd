 *"Bum's being a real Jew out there."* 




 NO 




 Even year magic!  




 *Shutters*


Edit: *shudders* 




 How do you Yost, that which is Yost.  




 You shut your mouth!  




 Did you guys see the late break on that snot rocket from Bum?  




 This exact comment was posted in an earlier game thread. NEVER FORGET!  




 Hot girl in left field bleachers.  




 Hosmer might be my favorite non-Giant.  




 Still a lot of baseball to be played. 




 We might get to see the best bullpen in the league sooner rather than later.  




 This pitcher needs a nickname that suggests he plays well in important games.  




 There's something you should know about reddit... 




 *"Hunter Pence looks like one of the burglars from Home Alone."*


More commentary from my sister.  




 *"None of the other team's players are cute."*


My sister's analysis of the game so far.  




 I started lifting in my garage where I have a bench and a barbell, so I can do the major barbell lifts with the exception of squats. Am I doomed to be a deformed freak who looks like he skips leg day?  




 CONGRATS ON THE DIVISION TITLE, DODGERS! 




 And now he has cemented his place in baseball history. Cool that it happened to him instead of a superstar  




 This is the funniest thing I've read on Reddit in months. How did your first time with the seat down go? 




 Dynasty! 




 If I would have put a piece of coal between my cheeks at the beginning of this game, I would have a diamond right now.  




 As much as I say I hate games like this, it really is what I love about sports.  




 Walk off balk. 




 Not in the third inning. 




 DAE Wainwright??? 




 Painfully awkward Rob Lowe hits a little too close to home.  




 Posey. Bum if he deals tonight. 




 I finally got around to alt-j's new album, This is All Yours. I was a fan of their first album, but I'm really disappointed with their latest work. It's very boring to me. I found myself constantly checking to see how many songs I had left and I could listen to something else. Anyone else feel this way?


On a related note, if you're a fan of alt-j, give Battleme a listen.  




 Harold just said, "Oedipus pitch." 




 What kind of adult would want a pirate themed living room?  




 Just don't watch highlights from Monday night ^too ^soon? 




 If Buster Posey and Hunter Pence had a child together, it would be Matt Duffy. 




 He said, "...100, and 99, respectively." 




 His real name makes him sound like a bare knuckle boxer. 




 Why do we need to see Tim Hudson while he's being interviewed? I want to see the game!  




 *"Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now."* 




 *sigh*

A's fans tying to manufacture a rivalry. 




 I knew exactly what this gif was going to be, but I still opened it. 




 OP pls, what does the meme say?  




 This is an album that I normally would never listen today, but I work in a store that sells CDs and quite a few people have been buying this lately. This morning, we played it at the store and I like what I heard, so I listened to it more closely when I got home from work. I have to say, it blew me away. 


While it definitely sounds more like a Tony Bennett album than a Lady Gaga album, Gaga knocks it out of the park. Her voice is a natural fit for this genre of music. In fact, she blows Tony Bennett out of the water. 


When I played this album, I couldn't help but imagine myself in a 1950s club, sitting at a table with a cigar and a glass of scotch...wearing a silk robe, while Bennett, Gaga and their band do their thing on stage. Even if this isn't your usual genre, it wasn't mine, give the album a spin because it truly is outstanding.  




 Scoring on a bad throw? How basic. 




 We won more games against STL than the Dodgers did!  




 Wild throw to first, you bum. 




 Our turn to walk off!  




 So 4th and goal from inside the 2. We opt to go for the TD and put the game away rather than make it a 13 point game and force their rookie QB to lead two touchdown drives.


4th and 1 near the STL 40 yard line. We opt to go for it rather than punt and pin the Rams inside their own 15. Instead, the Rams, who need a TD and a field goal to tie the game, only need to drive about 25 yards to get into field goal range. 




 Why go for it on 4th down when the Rams can still settle for a field goal. Now they're working on a short field.  




 Vernon is having a horrible game. 




 Just finished *Moneyball*. I'm looking for another nonfiction book, but something easily digestible.  




 I know there are a lot of Giants fans like me who live in the Sacramento area. Even if you don't, you should show your support for the Giants' AAA affiliate and join /r/SacramentoRivercats. The mod team there and at /r/AAAMiLB have worked hard to make sure each AAA team has a subreddit. Unfortunately, I think most of the current subscribers are still A's fans. Let's show them how loyal Giants fans are! 




 If only there was a system in place that would allow the two teams to play each other several times, then we could know which team is better.   




 We should pinch hit Bumgarner. 




 Almost every game in the playoffs has been close, but we haven't had a close series yet. Odd... 




 Saved by a wild pitch AGAIN! 




 http://i.imgur.com/FbuwEh4.gif 




 When you only face 4 batters, one home run is huge. 




 Had back surgery a few weeks ago. 




 If the Rockies are cheating, they sure are bad at it. 




 Matheny might have to put on the pads and catch the rest of this game.  




 Lance Lynn was 1 pitch away from striking out the side in order. Now he leaves the game and can do no better than a no decision. Rough. 




 He probably thought it was foul. It was hard to tell.  




 I gained a lot of respect for the Cards fans last night when they cheered when Jay was hit by a pitch when every other crowd would have booed like trained monkeys. 




 John Jay thinking he's Lorenzo Cain. 




 After what Matt Carpenter did to the Dodgers, I can't be mad at the guy.  




 Pitching one more inning will do that. 




 I've been waiting since 8 o'clock this morning for game time so I can pop open a beer without being judged by my mom.  




 I took Broncos -10.5 and was saved by the pick 6 as well. I got a second miracle with the Packers ML. 




 I like the Chargers -7.5. San Diego has been rolling this year and Oakland may be the worst team in the league.  




 Even Bumgarner's snot rockets have late break on them.  




 Crawford has the third best BA against lefties among left handed batters this year iirc.  




 Ball dude was on that like white on rice. 




 This comment is NaCl positive. 




 Giants and Cardinals are being way too civilized in this thread. It doesn't feel right.  




 Chrissy Redford is a babe. 




 Giants baseball. If it's not weird, we don't do it. 




 Was that an appeal to the 1st base umpire on a left handed hitter?  




 *"Cliche cliche cliche cliche?"*



*"Well, cliche cliche cliche cliche."* 




 When will the Giants/Dodgers playoff series that LA fans kept taking about start?  




 Cardinals uniforms look like they were taken off a field 100 years ago. Love them!  




 Well, if we're talking about the best hitting pitcher in baseball this year, can anyone top .258 with 4 homeruns?  




 He also hit .258 




 I like Harold Reynolds on Baseball Tonight, but he's insufferable as a color commentator.  




 Because Harold Reynolds.  




 One inning in and I finally realize how much I like having the regular play by play call. It's weird watching without it. 




 But then we would only have Joe Buck to complain about. 




 It's basically like Snapchat. You take a picture and all of your matches can see and "like" it for 24 hours. It's really pretty stupid, but if I can think of something funny to do, I'll do it. Android has moments too.  




 I've never had much luck with parlay bets, especially in football where upsets are fairly common, but they sure are exciting! I usually only do parlays when there are two events that are near sure things. You can usually find them in the early rounds of tennis tournaments when two top seeds are playing unknowns or in Champions League soccer when a great team is playing a team from a much smaller league. For football, I usually stick to single bets. If there are two games that I feel especially confident in, I will parlay the money lines.  




 Don't let that scare you away. 


I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me. 


The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet. 
 




 That's just tthe odds. In order to win $100, you would need to bet $105. Not sure why the Pats don't show the odds though.  




 Only a few likes so far. Will update if anything changes.  




 His Snapchat name is dickbaby69. He doesn't post much, but I usually get a chuckle when he does.  




 I took it from a guy I follow on Snapchat who does the YouTube channel BroScienceLife. He did It about a month ago.  




 Brian Cushing looks like the guy who would have sex with your girlfriend and then get mad at you when you get upset about it. 




 Good thing Carey isn't a ref. 




 Awesome, man! Looking forward to catching some games this season. 




 I'm assuming most of the mods are A's fans and the change in affiliation probably affected their interest in the River Cats. Are there any plans to change moderators and/or add moderators? I'd hate to see this subreddit be neglected. 




 As far as I'm concerned, Vogey cemented himself as a Giants legend last night. Couldn't be happier for the guy either. 




 Probably the MVP of the series, even in a losing effort. Not a fan of the guy's...baseball persona, but he really is a special player.  




 This is the first player to retire that I can remember coming up as a young guy. Weird. 


At any rate, he had quite the career.  




 Honestly, no one likes those self gratifying posts anyway. As if a Cardinals fan saying, "Great series. You have a good team. I would have rooted for you if you had beaten us" would make them feel any better. 




 Dude, don't be *that guy*. 




 This comment tests positive for NaCl.  




 Giants  Dodgers 




 Come on, man. Don't be like that. 




 Super creepy Rob Lowe  Far less attractive Rob Lowe 




 I think I saw him shit in a gutter in the Tenderloin before game three. 




 Romo has been nasty the last month. 




 That play might lead to a Posey Addendum to the Posey Rule.
