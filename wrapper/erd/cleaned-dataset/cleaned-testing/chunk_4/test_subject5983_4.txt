 YourMovieSucks is hilarious. 




 You're the coolest. I'd love one.  




 I can get you one of those, real cheap.  




 Oh yeah. Good one. 




 Pretty much anything from Korine is hard to recommend. 




 Mine would probably be Hunger.  




 Viola Davis in Doubt 




 That's cool. 




 HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME 




 Cat's Cradle would be nearly impossible to do well enough to deserve the name. 




 You should watch the movie "The Hunt". 




 I could care less about the bat-shit storyline. The gameplay is phenomenal, though. I've put a lot of time into it. 




 Blue Valentine and Punch-Drunk Love. Blue Valentine is just dark and sad, but Punch-Drunk love is actually pretty sweet and funny overall but it deals with emotionally fragile/disabled characters and gets pretty dark at times. 




 It's amazing to play Infamous: Second Son and then this game and think that they're from the same console generation. This game looks miserable. 




 Yes fucking please. 




 It's worth noting that it has 100% on RottenTomatoes. 




 Cranston couldn't? 




 How long until dead actors are starring in new movies? 




 I've been listening to Chance the Rapper ever since he was part of Instrumentality. I got 10 Day the hour it came out. 




 That was the first thing that came to mind for me too. 




 What accent is that PSH is using? 




 Please God, more of this. The funniest Lets Play in recent memory.  




 Payback and then Get the Gringo for that unofficial "Porter" Double Feature. 




 It's on Netflix. 




 Of course Seattle. 




 And he does a damn good job finding it. 









 Someone else that did this recently and owned the fuck out of it was Jake Gyllenhaal in Prisoners. He added so much depth to an otherwise relatively 2D character. 




 I mean, they do say "DO NOT REMOVE THIS CARD FROM AIRCRAFT". 




 Fantastic Mr. Fox or Mary   Max. Both absolutely incredible. 




 That's not my point. Fisher is an aging, American, raspy-voiced, father. Hardy is a young Brit. I have no doubt he'll make a great Fisher for the movie, but it won't be the same Fisher from the games. 




 I disagree. Not to say that this movie will suck or anything, but it will most definitely be just another action movie that happens to have the same name as a beloved video game franchise. Tom Hardy is a great leading man for an action-thriller, but he's not a great Sam Fisher. 




 I wish they kept this a secret so the movies had more "FUCK YEAH!" moments. However, "FUCK YEAH MEL GIBSON!". I hope he's just porter again. Watching Payback Straight Up and Get the Gringo back to back make me long for more. 




 Good luck kicking Statham's or Wahlberg's ass. 




 What's the worst that could've happened? Super powers? 




 Thats poetic, I think. 




 I like it, but I think it looks to vintage and quirky to represent Inception well. 




 Either.  




 **The Dark Night**

(Everything's in order.) 




 Are you sure it's not Gahndi, then? 




 *Ghandi 




 I'd give you gold for that if I wasn't so lazy 




 Hell yes. 




 Oh fuck off. You know this is great. 




 Somebody please make a font. 




 I think he might get a best adapted screenplay nom. 




 Which episode was he in again? 




 Little bit of column A, little bit of column B. 




 You are a younger him. 




 I can't wait until the miniseries spinoff. It has a lot of great people involved, so here's to hoping they don't fuck it up. 




 He can. Once he lands in water he starts treading.  




 My last year of middle school was the last year of real dodgeball. Now they took away the hard rubber balls and replaced them with soft foam balls that are impossible to throw at more than 5 mph.  




 Explains why Google is so productive. I've been to their NYC office and it was the coolest building I've ever been in. It was like a playground for adult geniuses. 




 Better safe than sorry. 




 Corey Stoll. Taller, bald, younger, thinner, more handsome, famous for playing a politician and talking to a woman. 

Tell me I got it. 




 Because I said "They apparently forget all about it after [](#s "they kill Silva")." 




 Which was before [] (#s "they killed Silva") 




 Skyfall started off being all about this disc with the names of all undercover agents in M16. They apparently forget all about it after [](#s "they kill Silva"). 




 First thought: Of course Jack knows everything about bowling. 




 The time stamp failed me, but he's at 1:19. It's uncanny. 









 It's a brilliant black comedy. You won't be disappointed.  




 Rubber Dingy Rapids, bro. 




 ~Copies and pastes Screenplay to *Four Lions*~ 




 Rainbow Six Vegas. That game was a fucking blast to watch. 









 Fuck that other "comedian". There's no way anyone going into comedy professionally should be that easily offended. Solid joke, not offensive. 




 FUCK now I can't remember either. Let me know when you find out. 




 A Cartoon Network short series called "Purple   Brown", if memory serves. 




 So then what (other than morals and what not) prevents me from going to Redbox with The Princess Diaries in hand, renting Thief, taking the Thief disc and putting The Princess Diaries disc in the pouch and go claim that the previous owner switched it? 




 Not surprising considering the song was written for the movie. 




 Yeah I know. I thought that a funny 5 second clip out of context would be appropriate though. 









 I just watched Prisoners. It came out last year and I hadn't seen any of Denis Villenevue's work prior and it blew me away. I've already rewatched it and I love it. Incredible performances all around and an incredibly tight and intense thriller/mystery. For me, it's easily up there with movies like Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs. 




 Earl? 




 Can we just talk about how great "legal eagles" is? 




 The guy had a goddamn fan club. People tend to be fucked up. 




 Oh yeah. Here are some more serial killer's handwriting samples:
[Zodiac Killer](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkj2ohBcpq1qel48oo1_500.jpg)
[Jeffrey Dahmer](http://www.annakoren.com/images/jeffrey-dahmer-handwriting.jpg)
[John Wayne Gacy](http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/5/8/7/2/8/2/i/9/3/7/p-large/john_wayne_gacy_mud_felons_claw.jpg) 




 For a little comparison, [here's Richard Ramirez's](http://www.crimelibrary.com/blog/files/2013/01/night-stalker-letter-billy.png)
[and here's Charles Manson's](http://cassandraparkin.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/charles-manson.jpg) from a book called Little Billy's Letters.  




 All due respect, I don't think "passed away'' is the appropriate term for his case. 




 I didn't see it. But there shouldn't have to be a shitty sequel just to clean up after the first film. 




 Not Viggo. His voice isn't raspy enough and I don't want to hear his country accent. Plus, he may be too old. Maybe Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Josh Brolin, or Joel Edgerton. They've all done good country accents in the past.
