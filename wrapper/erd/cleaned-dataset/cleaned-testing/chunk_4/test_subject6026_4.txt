 Yeah,you should've posted this to the [Five nights at Fuckboys subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/fnafb) though 




 I was wondering if I needed my serial code on the back of my 3ds to still trade it in. After a long time it came off of course. I remember trying to trade in my old DS lite before and gamestop didn't let me because the serial code was gone. I was also wondering how much money is knocked off if you don't turn it in with the charger.
