 I can see him getting the start in LF tonight. 




 Nice! 




 How can you defend this decision? Gyorko was atrocious last year and looks just as bad so far. You're literally going to keep him rostered because some random guy had him on a sleeper post?

Guerrero is killing it. He's done more in the past 4 days what Gyorko will do all week. Worst case scenario, if Guerrero does horrible, just pick Gyorko back up, no one is going to claim him off of waivers. 




 Oswaldo vs RHP 




 Keep cueto and Hernandez. The others are replacable. 




 Best response here. You're getting fleeced, guerrero might not even play tonight. Tell that owner you don't want a bench player. 




 Would def drop Crawford for him. If it's a 10 team league there's probably better options than semien on waivers though. 




 Went 3-5 with 4 rbis yesterday while filling in for Uribe. Apparently he is awful defensively, but after that performance perhaps he earned some playing time. Considering starting him over Melky this week in a 6x6. Anyone have insight into this? 




 Travis could be legit this year. Check out today's buy/sell column at razzball.com he's the front runner on it. 




 You're overthinking, as the season goes on it their starts will disperse, contract, etc.

Squad looks good, congrats on starting up fbb! 




 Honestly it's too hard to tell, improvement would probably be negligible, the guys on your squad look fine. If it's your first year congratulations. Read up on these guys, if one of the waiver wire dudes seems more intriguing for some reason, scoop him. I'd probs drop Quintana for Warren, maybe even Gausman. 




 Over thinking 




 Lol I'd shudder to think he's that bad. He did get unlucky last year. He's also like what, 24? Apparently he worked his ass off this offseason. I had him in 2013 so will forever have a soft spot for the little guy. 




 Pretty encouraging projections for him actually. Check out what fangraphs says about him, looks like he could be a great sleeper this year. 




 I love segura this year. I think he's due for a big bounce back. Hopefully the brewers trade him so he gets into a better lineup. I expect him to be hitting at the top of the order by May. 




 He got very lucky last year. Look him up on fangraphs there's a good amount of material on how his peripherals screamed regression for this year. Still a good player, just probably won't repeat last years effectiveness. I'd try to deal him to someone looking to buy low.

EDIT: I still think he's better than the waiver wire fellas you mentioned  




 I wish, too. Unfortunately he was part of the Craig Kimbrel trade, might get called up in Atlanta soon though. 









 Who's his replacement? 




 Why'd you leave cbs? You were easily the best analyst they had. 




 Baez taking over at 2nd then? 




 I assume this means Baez is being brought up? 









 Is jean segura available?  




 How would you rank Joc Pederson, Marcell Ozuna and Charlie Blackmon for 2015?  




 Great post, wasn't aware of a lot of these performances.

Why the sell high on Cespedes? Peripheral stat analysis I've read says he could hit a ton of bombs this year. 




 H2H categories. AVG RBI RUN SB SLG

This is a non-keeper league. I keep reading high rankings on Ozuna and I don't really understand it. 25 HR with a 260 average and negligible speed? Doesn't do it for me. Blackmon the concern is he might platoon at his position and his stats outside of coors are underwhelming. Pederson obviously has the highest ceiling, but will have the struggles of a rookie. 

Right now I'm leaning towards Blackmon and Pederson. 




 Well said. I wouldn't be surprised if managers have been tempted to do that but stopped themselves due to the barrage of media questions that would ensue. 
Have you closer shut out the 7thing inning only to have another arm blow it in the 9th? No one wants to step up to the podium after that. 




 Don't know who Donnie is, sounds like a swell dude.. 

Talking to a guy at work whose a dodgers fan about this, figured I'd see if the sub had any extra info. 




 I'd vote give it to the hottest arm in Paco Rodroguez. While a small sample size his minor league numbers are dope, worth giving this kid a shot. 




 Deepest apologies for the pun in the title. For the sake of the post, let's say committee isn't an option(even though that's the most likely outcome). 




 Oh my bad, I thought you hadn't drafted yet and you'd be losing your 7th. I'd rather have altuve then, unless your pitching rotation is in dire need of an upgrade. 




 I'm with you, keep Harvey. Could be a stud and be with you for the next few years of your league. Losing a 7th round pick for altuve is a big opportunity cost, and you have above average2B in Wong as replacement. Stick with your boy, he's trying to deal altuve for a reason. 




 Yeah he could be a solid rookie sleeper. For me, his ceiling this season isn't much better than what you'd find in most of the average second baseman available though. So while the cost is dirt cheap, he's a gamble, high risk for medium reward. There's more exciting rookies id rather devote a bench spot too and hold throughout the season. 




 Nytimes did a fairly comprehensive piece on it yesterday if anyone's interested http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/business/trans-pacific-partnership-seen-as-door-for-foreign-suits-against-us.html?referrer= 




 By balls to the wall do you mean the 31st ranked defense in the league that year? Perry would have been fired if we didn't make the playoffs. The only reason the D came together in the playoffs is from leaders like Antrel Rolle and Justin tuck stepping up and rallying it together as a unit. We were the first playoff team that had more point against than points forward during the regular season. Eli literally had to bail us out in the 4th quarter of almost every game that year, which is what made it so exciting. But our defense was atrocious and Perry doesn't deserve that ring. 









 Is there a running backpack I can wear that will safely and securely hold my DSLR? 




 Anyone know where the background picture is from? 




 Why? Because everyone who joins the police force is a bigot doing it to abuse power and oppress freedoms? There's plenty of cops that genuinely want to just keep the people in their community safe.  




 Awesome, really impressed with how well put together this is. Already feel immersed after reading, artwork also very cool. Never stop creating. 




 Baldur's Gate 2 or Deus Ex. 




 Thank you for sharing this. 




 Wow really impressive, lighting is awesome brings so much life to it. Animaton reminds me of the ps3 game "Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch" 




 I'm looking into buying my first DSLR. Been a lurker on this subreddit and some other blogs for a while now. Consensus seems to be the Nikon D3300 is a great entry level camera. My question is, is it worth to save $100-200 on a refurbished camera or should I shell out the extra cash for a new one? 









 Any recommendations on high quality shoes/underwear? 




 Awesome thanks so much for your response, definitely have a lot of browsing/thinking to do- 




 I'd mostly be doing this for weekends at the longest in Upstate New York to give an idea of the type of durability/terrain. 














 Nothing in the article on how old they're estimating these to be? 




 Nope this was the moon. 




 Correct that the main light source is the moon. This was November 2nd, about 2AM.

I don't think this was a Lens flare, as I saw this with my naked eye as well, and took a video that showed the same image.

Sorry I'm a complete noob at astronomy. I took this picture 11/2/13 in upstate NY (not sure if this information can help me narrow down the positioning of what I was looking at.

Apologies for the iPhone screenshot, I couldn't find the original picture but had this as my background.

I'm not even certain this is a planet, but would love to hear what you folks think.

Thanks! 




 Could you expand on this a bit? Not a fan of either team so was following the game pretty leisurely, what decisions on particular? 




 This was fundamentally a completely different offense than what had been in place for the better part of a decade. Very difficult to learn and succeed during the season, naturally going to have a lot of growing pains. If you watch the team's performance throughout the year there is a lot of evident progress, I'm excited to see what it can do next year with an improved line.

Take veteran quarterbacks in the league who are considered top of their class: Brady, Rodgers, Peyton, Brees- out of these, these players have been in the same system their entire careers (I know Peyton changed teams, but he's on another level and runs his own operation- this scheme stayed the same). If you take any of these guys and stick them in an entirely different offense schematically, there's going to be significant growing pains. And while there was a good amount of miscommunication early on in the year, Eli still put up very good numbers overall, which is reason to have higher expectations heading into next season.

Other commentators have mentioned we were beleaguered with injuries- this is true, but honestly I don't like using it as an excuse because I feel good teams can overcome that.

Giants had a lot of games this year they were competitive in until the 4th quarter when they fell apart.

Defense was completely unreliable, truly atrocious at times. Perry Fewell would have been fired in 2011 if it hadn't been for Eli bailing out the defense each week and eventually winning a Super Bowl.

Special Teams is another black eye for the Giants and has been for quite some time. Our coach, Tom Quinn, I'm convinced is someone in ownership's brother-in-law, boggles my mind the man has a job in this league.

Giants fans have a lot to be excited about going into next year. The division has some powerful teams, but it's certainly within their grasp. 
























 You're the man, Wesley! 




 12 team 6x6 H2H

I'm stacked with closers, would this be overpaying? 




 The show hasn't been completely faithful to the book, hence my worry.
