 Understanding sarcasm.  I'm not sarcastic so I'm never sure if I'm on the receiving end of it.  Unless it's blatantly obvious.  Sarcasm through text messages are the worst. 




 Elaine? 




 Dateline! 




 I use a bit of twitter to get the word out.  My little blog also has lots of photos so sometimes the restaurants or stores use them on their Facebook pages.  I get a good boost in traffic when that has happened.

Edited for spelling 




 This!  The freedom of rolling around in your undies on cool sheets.   




 This will be my first Secret Santa gift exchange!  I'm thinking about spoiling my giftee with something homemade.  Perhaps some handmade candles + soaps :D  









 I think that he's wearing a woman's shirt.  The moobs don't help, but the shirt doesn't look like it's cut for a guy. 




 Awwww I don't know her and I already love her :D Yay for Alice!! 




 That poor assistant had to keep on smiling... how uncomfortable. 




 Maybe you could rub some sugar+olive oil+honey on your lips and let it soak in.  Then after rinsing off with warm water you could use a natural lip balm (non medicated, just simple oil+beeswax type) and try to stop licking your lips.  I know that when I get wind chapped lips I tend to lick it a lot ... which makes it worst. 









 Hot stinky breath, greasy hair, and musky clothes, this is how I imagine what Russell Brand smells like from watching that gif. 




 That was such a strange way of holding a cup with that much liquid.  It made the video more intense cause I kept thinking it would spill over.  




 I'm not really sure.. maybe a total of 20-30 minutes?  As soon as we got off the Bart, walked up the stairs, and we saw a line that was already formed outside on the corner.  Someone was there at a table selling round trip tickets.  The shuttle arrived after 10 minutes of waiting and the ride was 15-20 minutes.  Make sure you only use clear bags or gallon ziplocks.  We totally forgot about it, but good thing my purse was pretty small :D  Have a great time if you decide to go! 




 And we are back!  We jumped on the south Hayward Bart, transferred at bay fair, got off at balboa, jumped on the 75x then arrived at candlestick!  Thank you all for helping :)   




 I saw them on Yelp!! I'm tempted to go get some pumpkin beer lol :D 




 Just downloaded! Thank you :) 




 You are amazing!  Thank you so much for your help :D 




 Thank you so much for your help!  We tried asking the hotel staff and they had no clue.  After we get off the bart at Balboa Park, will the 75x bus be nearby?  




 Hi guys!  We are here for a 49ers game tomorrow and staying in Hayward.  I would love some help on figuring out how to get there.  We want to take the Bart but not sure which exit to get off.  I've also read that it's not really walkable from the Bart station to candlestick.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you. 




 This is exactly what I was thinking... 

 If not the budget, then perhaps buying different items or presenting the food in a better way...  




  I just think that this picture looks a little sad for a big company like sirius to tweet out.  Unless that was part of the joke...  




 No, the sternshow Instagram account posted it.  The spread is kind of sad :( I think I could buy stuff at Costco that would look better than this. 




 Nice strong forearms on a guy. 




 When I make my own Almond milk, I like to blend a date into it.  Sweetens it and adds a great flavor.  But since you're on Keto, you could add a few drops of flavored Capella or flavored stevia. 




 I find that most people like to talk about their favorite movies or television shows.  You can open with " hey have you watched ________ yet?" then fill in the blank with the last movie you watched. Then BAM you're talkin it up! 




 Wow a Barbie face with a GI Joe body... 




 I think the whole styling + look she's giving makes her look like a cast member of "Real Housewives of Orange County."  She looks younger and fresher when she smiles.  She looks older, amateurish, and like she is trying too hard in this pic :( 




 What year is this? 1994? Thumbs down on Barbados.  However, I actually liked Online Sweetheart :D 




 I could not stop laughing!!  My favorite line was " my body is rejecting this." 




 I LOLed at the Venus fly trap comment.. ahahahah.  I killed 20 BSF adults yesterday and there hasn't been anymore today, so hopefully it's over.  I was thinking maybe they're trying to come inside since the AC is on and it's 100 degrees outside.  I haven't looked in the bin in 2 weeks cause I've been scared.  Later on today I'm planning on going outside with the vacuum hose and suck up any BSF adults I see in the bin.  Wish me luck.  eeeek 




 So I've been trying to starve my bin a bit and today I've started to see Black Soldier Fly adults inside my house!  ACK!  Is there a reason why they would want to come into the house?  We don't have any rotting food, our back door hasn't been opened, but I still see them gathering around the window closest to the door.  Could they be crawling in from around the door? Why are they in the house? AHHh help please lol.   




 You and your "huge-ass roommate" really are great people :D  Makes me proud that you live in Los Angeles! 




 I have a scentsy one that I love and a walmart one for our restroom.  I've noticed that walmart does have a great selection and new ones all the time. 




 Hm.. I've ordered from Candles by Victoria, Front Porch, and Grumpy Girls. I think there are more but those are all I can remember off the top of my head. Since I make candles, I just scoop out leftover wax from testing and use it in my tart warmer.   




 I haven't..but their melters seem to all come in Blue.. strange... ahahaah 




  I LOVE your blog.  There I said it :D That Pesto recipe looks delicious. 




 That's why I've left it that way for this long.  The thing that does bother me is it runs on with my posts titles.  For example, if a title of a page is "my first post" it looks like " My first posttest_subject6067.com" . Should I just leave a space after my titles or add a space in front of sitename .  I don't even know if that would work!  




 Was looking at my titles and it seems like the default has sitename in it.  Do I really need it for better Seo?  Thank you!
