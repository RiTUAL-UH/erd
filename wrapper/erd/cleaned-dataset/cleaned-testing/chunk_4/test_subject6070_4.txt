 In my second year, still a lot of work but the first year is burtal. It isn't just the long hours but it is also that most of my friends did not get why I couldn't hang out like I used to. I found myself pretty isolated my first year. Now I have teacher friends , and my old? m
 friends have come to understand that I am not a bartender any more. I love my students and my class room management skills have significantly improved from last year 




 Have the students do a Mini DBQ. For my US I have them watch the crossing and do follow a long question sheet and then write a short essay. It never hurts to have a review of the stuff we do in the beginning of the year. Also mini DBQ, and a movie are pretty hard for a sub to mess up. 




 Forgot to mention the schools on James island are good too 




 It depends on your definition of uniform, elementary and middle schools typically have a "uniform" that consist of certain colors they can wear to school khaki and navy blue pants , and white shirts. Its pretty much a stricter dress code , not a true uniform that the school issues. Most high schools let kids wear whatever as long as it isn't to revealing or offensive. 




 Teacher here, unless you are in Mt. Pleasant the schools in Charleston county are not ideal, Berkley and Dorchester 2 have good options. 




 There is a bar dt called prohibition they have swing bands play from time to time. Other than that I am not sure. 




 This is what I love ab the bi community, you would be hard pressed to find a group of people more open minded and willing to see people as individuals.

 Great straight teeth with no cavities thanks dad, chronic teeth grinding and jaw clenching thanks mom 




 Mr. Feenie 




 I tell my kids on the first day, about my time in school , that I have ADD and dyslexia, that I had a difficult home life. I talk about excuses vs.  adjustment, that I will not accept excuses but that from time to time students need adjustments. I encourage them to let me know if they need an adjustment. As the year goes on I share more and more about my life when it seems to fit, for example we watch student news sometimes and their was a story about a teenager that committed suicide, I told my students I used to work for a suicide hotline and that I would always be there to listen if they needed to talk. I had a student come talk to me a couple weeks later about feeling suicidal. If a kid seems "off" I pull them out in the hall and ask if they are ok, invite them to come see me during lunch.  Even if nothing is going on  it lets them know I care, and more often than not something is going on and they share.   




 I don't actually use twitter, my school is pretty big on not being friends with current students on social media. I give them a post it and have them write a # after we read a short passage. So say we were looking at FDR's speech after pearl harbor, kids might write #teamUSA #WWII #daysthatwillliveinimfany it helps them pick out some of the major points, I use them as an exit slip sometimes.  




 I have been told I have certain set of skills, but I honestly think it is because I never sleep with people that I don't already feel really strong chemistry with. 




 You don't believe in laws like don't rape or kill anyone? I could see not turing them in for drugs or getting in a fight. But if my child severely damaged or killed another human I would turn them in. I would also get them a lawyer and continue to love them, but at that point they are beyond talking to. 




 My cousin was about 10 years older than me so she was an adult in my eyes. I think being around  stable family is great I know I really enjoyed being at my friends house , maybe just take the opportunity when you happen to be alone to ask how things are going. One of my best friends mom used to do this, I would wake up early when I slept over so I could have breakfast and talk to her mom alone.  




 I had two fuck buddies , both were supposed to be my first one night stand, but in both cases the sexual chemistry was so good that we decided to be fuck buddies. I have still never had a real one night stand. 




 Every time I have taken a break it has been because I wanted to pursue things with some one else. Needless to say none of those relationships worked out. The problem with a break is it leaves you in relationship limbo , you can't move on and you can't enjoy the relationship. If you are taking a break to ease the blow of an actual break up or because you would like to stay friends then I would suggest a clean break and an agreement not to talk for 6 months. At the end of 6 months go to lunch , you will probably be able to be friends at that point.  




 Sexual predators almost never attack just once, you would be putting countless people in danger and your child would think that you are simi ok with it because you talked to him / her ab it and didn't turn them in. Some times the hardest part of being a parent is disapline.


 




 My parents went through a really nasty divorce when I was 13. I didn't live close to my aunts or uncles, but here are some things I wish the adults in my life would have done. Don't trash talk either party, I loved my mom I loved my dad but I felt like I had no one neutral to talk to , everyone had taken sides. I wish an adult had taken me to do something one on one, when your parents are divorceing they are so wrapped up in their own drama they forget to take time to be a parent. It is nice to have some one on one time with a stable adult.  My parents did get my sister and I into counseling, but I hated the counselor I finally told my cousin who let my dad know. I got a counselor that I liked after that. If she hadn't given me the space to talk ab my feelings I probably would have never told anyone. Remember that ugly divorces can go on for years even if the paper work is finalized, it wasn't until I went to college that I finally felt relief from my parents drama and manipulation. Unfortunately patent will use their kids to punish one another. 
 




 It depends on the level of the students. If they are higher level you may be able to use reading like a historian. http://sheg.stanford.edu/rlh
I typically use a non primary source to give them an idea of what we are talking about and then give then a primary source document. We break it down as a class after each paragraph we talk about how we would say it. Sometimes I have them do a # that would follow it if it were on twitter to check for understanding. For the Gettysburg Address I break the speech up into sections and have groups re-write it on the white board. For my students primary source work is all bout understanding so anyway we can break it down is huge. You may also be able to use some mini DBQs they have step by step instructions on how to use documents to create an outline and eventually write a argumentative essay. Hope that helps good luck on your first year. 




 This is how pd should go, meet with your department for 30 min meet with your grade level for30 min , go over leagel bs that has to be covered 30min. Have the first years and new teachers meet with admin for an hour to go over school policy. Spend the rest of the day working on what you need to because you are a fucking professional and you know what you need to do. Why is that so hard? I came back to school a week early because of all the pd we have this year. I pitty the teachers that didn't because they are only going to have one day to get everything together. 









 I have never cried because a celebrity died until today. I always felt that Robin Williams was the fun uncle of my generation. His work was peppered through out my childhood and brought me so much joy. He seemed to be touched by fire that made him both brilliant and self destructive. With a heavy heart Robin we will miss you. 




 Perhaps I can shed some light on the situation, I had been in only hetero relationships and while I was interested in f/f relationship it just never really presented itself. I met a lesbian and we hit it off as friends after hanging out a few times she told me that she thought she was developing feelings for me. I was really thankful for her honesty because it let me choose to experiment with her and not feel pushed into it. We dated for a little while and while the physical part of the relationship was good I realized I couldn't fall in love with her and I ended things. Because our relationship was built on honesty we both did minimal damage to one another. 
So your assumption that for mostly straight folks it may not be more than a physical expression may be correct, I think that if you handle this relationship with honesty and respect then it could have a positive out come.  




 I used to be part of a studio that offered fantastic teachers and a variety of yoga classes, but I recently moved, and their was only one place in town that offered yoga. It is at the local gym and  they have yoga 2 days a week, the teacher is newly trained (200 hour) and the class seems to be for beginners. I honestly don't feel challenged in there I love the class because it gives me the space to practice with others, and I always feel more grounded after I leave. However I don't feel like I am progressing in my practice, I have been supplementing with youtube videos, but it isn't the same as having a teacher adjust you especially for more difficult poses. Any suggestions  or advice would be appreciated. 




 I think my biggest victory has been applying my practice off of the mat. I get anxious about things I have no control over and lately when I feel it starting I can focus on my breathing and calm my mind. It also makes me more patient with myself because I think about how many times I fell out of poses before I was able to hold them and that I was only able to do it because I kept trying. I also really enjoy that my body will crave yoga now, I feel what needs to be worked and what poses help me. 




 I get runners high but only after 45 min or so of working out. To be fair though my body is really sensitive. For example if I drink a coke after 12pm I will be up until 1 or 2 am. I also get drunk off of like 2 1/2 beers...so there's that. 




 I was having a discussion with a friend one time about religion, and she said if you don't believe in God then why are sunsets so beautiful? Her reasoning was that their was no evolutionary reason for humans to find sunsets beautiful. There for it was God's way of reminding us that we were souls everyday. It made me happy to think about it for a while. Often times religious people assume that atheism is a choice, it really wasn't for me. When I looked at the evidence I just couldn't believe anymore. Sometimes I wish I could, and sometimes when I watch the sunset I do. 




 Fantastic list thanks 




 The national archives maybe a good place to start, it would depend on what you were teaching but they would almost certainly have documents on how these nations have interacted with the US .
http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/ 
this is the teachers link but the whole site has great resources.
 




 Great list I forgot about some of those , thank you so much! 




 love crash course, use it in my class often! 




 I am putting together my emergency sub plans for the year and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for movies to show to my US History and Government/ Economics classes 




 I have 30 jobs total , but some of them are repeats my desk are split into 3 section and each sections has a specific person to get materials, collect papers, make sure the desk get re-organized after group work, some of my other jobs are answer the phone, open the door when there is a visitor, a person to fix typos on the power point, someone to water the plants, a person to let me know when the supply table is running low. a person to pass back graded work.I give them all very professional sounding names. It helps the class run smoothly and everyone contributes .  




 The first day I am planning to go over the rules, tell the kids a bit about me , and then I give them a dynamic duo card they have to find their partner ( think Batman and Robin , Bonnie and Clyde, Micky and Minnie ) I give them a few minuets to ask their partner questions then I have them present what they learned to the class. After that I assign class room jobs. fill out survey on learning style and home life. discuss materials needed for the class ask them to come see me after if they don't have materials so I can get them for the student ( I work in a title 1 school ) 
The second day, reviewing the rules , talking about classroom procedures (they will have gotten a preview of this when we assigned jobs) practicing some of the procedures . Start going over the syllabus , discuss the major projects and papers and when they will be due. Have kids practice their classroom jobs , mini lesson on what history is and why it is important.
