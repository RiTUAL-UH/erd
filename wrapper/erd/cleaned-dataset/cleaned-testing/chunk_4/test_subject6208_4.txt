 In all honesty I'd love to see Zac Efron in a really different role. Like something other than a comedy or romance movie. I think he is a talented actor, but he keeps choosing roles that are pretty boy roles. He wants to break from High School musical. He came close with the Paperboy, but he keeps playing the pretty boy. He needs to pick a role that will change his image or force him to play more than a pretty boy. Something like Christian Bales American Psycho.

Another talented actor is Robert Pattinson. Twilight may be terrible, but he was not the problem with them. He's good in what ever he does, but he keeps getting bad roles. Luckily The Rover looks really promising.

 Yeah, sort of. Like no one well known. Find fantastic actors who don't mind having sex, or good porno actors, and not make it sex with a story, but a story with sex. So I guess more like erotica. But have legitimately good writing, story, acting, a score, and cinematography. 

I always picture it like, "What if Terrence Malick made porn?" 




 It was just a short skateboard doc. More about the philosophical side of skateboarding. 




 I take the interstate *to* because it's quicker. I take the backroads *from* because it's beautiful. 




 The girls from The Crucible. 




 Nope. But I did work on a movie that was released in a few theaters and a documentary that won best cinematography and best short documentary. I've made a few short stuff, but nothing major. Although, I have thought about making a "good" porno before. 




 What about zombies you see in newer fiction? Zombies who are living, breathing humans infected with a virus instead of the undead. 




 I guess it depends on what you mean by movies.  




 Cold. 




 Try turning all things off that produce light (tv, night light, etc.). Make your room as dark as possible. Maybe get some white noise like a floor fan or ambient natural sounds like rain or waves. Also keep your room at a comfortable temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  




 Got me through high school 




 Learn the notes and practice. 

[UltimateGuitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) has tabs for just about every song. 




 Watch a movie. Nothing like losing yourself for two hours in another world. There are movies for all kinds of moods, all kinds of tastes. There's something for everyone. 




 Love :( 




 Dream job no doubt. I would fund my first feature length film and hope for the best. 




 Same it is every year: Be a better me than I was last year. 




 Made a post that was an album of screenshots of Mulan. 




 Mostly because of my religion. But even if it wasn't for my religion, I don't like needles.

Also the thought of a tattoo gives me anxiety. Having to decide what image/word I want to have on my body for the rest of my life is *too* much for me. 




 To move out west. 




 Movies and movie making. I guess it partly has to do with the escapism aspect of watching a movie. For two hours I can disappear into another world.

I love filmmaking because I love making stories and ideas a reality. I love telling stories visually. I'm good at it, and I've never really been good at anything really. When I make a film, I'm *creating art*. Which is so cool to me. I'm making something. I'm making an idea I had a reality. I'm bringing this idea to life and making it a physical thing.  




 My buns and thighs. I'm like the only guy I know who gains weight in his butt and thighs. All the other guys gain in their stomach or waist. I hate having a big booty.

Also, my face. I'm hairy everywhere else: my head, chest, arms, legs, butt, and nether regions. But for some reason I simply *cannot* grow facial hair of any kind. I'm in my twenties and I look like a chubby sixteen year old. 




 A Moment to Remember, a Korean film. I bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. It tells a story of a man and women who fall passionately in love, but their love is put to the greatest test when [Spoiler](/s "his wife develops Alzheimer's, develops dementia, and starts losing her memory. The last thirty minutes of it rips your heart right out.") 

Sounds cheesy, but it's executed perfectly and feels genuine and never comes off as cheesy or hoakey.
 




 There's a lot to pick from, but I really really love The Tree of Life. I think it's an incredible achievement in film. The fact that it can tell this ambitious, yet small story set across a cosmic, "greater power" background is incredible. This movie is very divisive I only know one person personally who liked it while the other people I know who saw it thought it was bad.

I saw it with my mother and we both cried. We could both relate to the story. I had a strict father who I knew loved me, but had a hard time showing it, and as a result I was closer to my mother than my father. The movie really resonated and affected me probably more than any other movie I saw. It's a beautiful film that tells a beautiful story and has gorgeous cinematography, visual effects, and music. With acting that reminds you that great acting doesn't have to be explicit, it can also be subtle.  




 Has to be Star Trek. The thought of just exploring the universe in what is probably one of the coolest space ships ever sounds incredible. 




 In no order

Inherent Vice

Gone Girl

Interstellar

The Raid 2

Knight of Cups (or any of the three Malick films that are supposedly coming out this year) 




 Right now it's Tarantino and Christoph Waltz. Mainly because I think they are a match made in heaven and it clearly comes across on screen. I wish they had gotten together earlier in their careers though. The more films they do together, the better.

Another match made in heaven are Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gossling as well as Winding Refn and Cliff Martinez, his choice composer.   




 1. 12 Years a Slave - I've heard quite a bit of criticism about this film being "pretentious", "self-indulgent", and "over rated". I love Steve McQueen and think he is a fantastic director. 12 Years is almost a perfect movie that I think will be considered a classic. I like how it was unflinching in its portrayal of slavery. We've often seen the hard labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. It also has some of the best acting I've seen.

2. The Place Beyond the Pines - Another movie that has received quite a bit of criticism, more so than 12 Years. I absolutely loved how this film almost felt like a stage play. How it was clearly broken into three acts. I think the acting, directing, and music are great. Could this movie have been better? I guess, but I still thought it was fantastic. I also really loved the father-son aspect of it. I'm super close to my father and this film really resonated with me and affected me emotionally more than any film this past year.

3. Only God Forgives - Probably the most divisive movie of the year. Heavily criticized for it's lack of story and plot. I think the minimalist thing works for this film though. What it lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style. I love Nicolas Winding Refn because he's unafraid to make the kind of movies we don't usually see. He doesn't care if you like his movies and that gives him more freedom. Only God Forgives probably has the best cinematography, set design, and score that I saw in a film last year. This movie isn't for everyone though so I understand why it's a divisive film. 




 There is /r/MoviePosterPorn 




 I actually found Looper to be underwhelming.  




 It's funny you say that because 4 isn't *that* bad and an "R" rating doesn't guarantee good. A Good Day to Die Hard returned to "R" and still was hot garbage.  




 There's a movie called This Means War about kids who have a pretend war with sticks and stuff, but you see it from their perspective so the stick guns look real and when they get shot there's blood. Pretty good movie.  




 Too bad they cut it off. 




 This has to be the *longest* Grammys yet. 




 Around $600 




 There was a post on here or r/gaming, but I'm sure it was here. It was an album of pics that turned skyrim into a desert. I can't find it anywhere. Anyone know where the post is or what the mod was called? 




 That sounds fantastic! 




 I've played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on consoles. I've finally decided to build a pc!

My question isn't necessarily "What are the must have mods?" My question is, what mods will freshen up the game and breath new life in it and change it up enough for someone who has spent hundreds of hours in this world? 




 You do know the first rule of being a troll is to not tell people you're a troll, right? Otherwise what's the point? 




 What does it do? 




 I don't want to out myself. 




 I'd change r/funny to r/AmeteurNight 




 Lost a lot of weight and got in shape. I'm now overweight again. Maybe *this* time they'll notice. 




 Movies have been around for a hundred years. Video games have only been around for only like half that at most. And they *were* originally created as a kid's toy sort of. But nowadays games are growing. They *are* a valid and great form of storytelling. I think in maybe thirty years it will get there. Honestly it probably won't be until graphics in games are nearly undistinguished from reality that they will be taken as seriously by *everyone*.  




 Injuries that involve bones breaking.  




 It's not high school. 




 I stayed awake for like 3 days once in Boy Scouts because we were cooking a lot of butts for a fundraiser. 




 I have to poop with my pants and underwear completely off. Like not around my ankles. Like off of me. It feels restrictive, and when I feel restricted I can't poop. 




 1. Graduating high school because I didn't take it seriously and almost didn't graduate.

2. Close second was becoming an Eagle Scout. I wasn't super into Boy Scouts, but I was so close to getting my Eagle and my parents really wanted me to do it, so I did. It made my parents super proud of me which makes me happy. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't give up entirely.  




 Sausage, beef, steak, six kinds of cheese, extra cheese, and white sauce instead of standard red pizza sauce. 




 Probably still in Memphis. Damn. Hopefully I'll be at least close to getting married to someone. Hopefully have a house. Hopefully I'll be a professor somewhere out west. 




 The toys I had. Kids today, and of the future, all their toys are electronics. Mp3 players, tablets, phones, etc. *My* toys were action figures, board games, stuffed animals, etc. These things still exist, but no child today wants these. When I was a kid all I wanted were G.I. Joes. Last year, my friends kid was asking him for an Xbox One, an ipad, and a moped. 




 Ate a lot. 




 Not really. I had probably close to twenty friends in high school. So far I only keep in touch with like four or five of them and only hang out frequently with like two of them.

With work and college, not only do you find it hard to keep in touch and get together with old friends, but you meet new ones. 




 I was babied pretty hard growing up. My parents never made me get a job and spoiled me and my sister. This led to me not being prepared for being on my own in the real world. Still love my parents to death, though. 




 So I'm 20 and I've only had two jobs. One was for a place I worked at for only a month before leaving for school. I went to school for a year. Then I got another job. I had every intention of keeping this job. However I was laid off after only a month because "they couldn't afford to keep me on."

My question is, when applying for a job, should I leave off the second job? My mother said I should because it makes me look bad because it looks like I quit jobs after only a month. But I said I *should* put my second job because experience is experience, even if it is just an extra month.

Is putting on the second job on applications hurting my chances of getting a job? 




 Fags are going to hell and shouldn't be given any rights, we already made this mistake once with black people, don't let it happen again. 




 Clothes, movies, definitely junk food. 




 I guess pretty far. Mine would suggest it was long. 




 Today I learned 




 I thought it had a fantastic first three quarters that were filled with suspense and great directing, but that last quarter turned into a generic possession/exorcism scene. 




 A 2001: A Space Odyssey remake directed by J.J. Abrams starring Brad Pitt and featuring Matthew McConaughey as HAL. 




 Blue Valentine. Very sad, tragic and beautiful movie. 




 Man the last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely fantastic!  




 It's a shame we likely won't see this movie anytime soon, if at all. 




 Charlie's Angels. Yeah the movie is dumb, but I think Rockwell kills it. 




 Bad posture.  




 She knows 




 Can they be purchased? Would love to have one in the dining room or hearth room.  














 I love movies that have spy stuff, secret agent stuff, undercover stuff, and surveillance stuff. But not James Bond movies, movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Body of Lies. Like the more realistic and maybe even more politically charged ones. The Bourne movies are another example. What are some similar movies?  




 Don't forget glamorous! 




 Any lyric that rhymes a word with the same exact word. 

Also, "Baby can you breathe?/ I got this from Jamaica/ It always works for me-heeeee"

In that weird whisper voice of his.  




 I don't know, if my phone rings or I get a text, I'll see who it is. If it's my sister it's usually an emergency because she never calls me unless it's important. It's always usually a text. My phone shows me a preview of a text and if it appears to be an emergency, I'll look at it, but if it's just a mundane message it can wait.  




 I chew with my mouth closed in public but when I'm around my immediate family, I don't monitor how I chew. Is this still rude? 









 They can be comic strips, graphic novels, or anything. Just not a super hero themed one. 




 Really beautiful! Can someone with more knowledge than me explain what RAW is and what shooting in it does? 




 That's what I'm wondering. Why post this when the casting appears to already be over? 




 I'm shooting a documentary and I'm looking to get some nice skyline and rooftop shots of Memphis. What are some places where I can do this? 




 I'm not saying critics are always right. I love plenty of movies critics call "terrible." But ratings act as a guideline for people. Most people don't have the time to pick just any movie and hope its good. They want it to be worth their time. They want to know it will be good. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of horror movies are poorly rated, which hurts the genre. Now smaller, creative, and good horror movies don't get seen. Critics are most definitely not always right, but they do have a HUGE influence on what people watch.  




 Yeah I thought the zombie pov was super creative, but I guess I'm just so over zombies. Also, in all honesty, the eyeball one, while kinda cool in concept, was sooo dumb.  




 I agree, but I think the way to do it is to set up jump scares that don't happen. Here's a comment I made earlier. 

"See the thing about jump scares is that they are only suppose to happen twice. Once at the beginning and once at the end. The point of the first one is to put the audience on edge. Showing them that anything can pop out at any minute. What makes this effective is that by not having a jump scare again, you put the audience in suspense of something that won't happen again. That's why the jump scare is genius. You make them think it can happen at anytime but don't. The point of the second and final jump scare is for the payoff. Now that the audience has been waiting the entire time for the next jump scare, they let their guard down because it's been like an hour or so. That's when you let loose the second and final jump scare.

That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes."

 That's what I hear. I only saw part of the first season. Is it more supernatural stuff like ghosts or what? 




 I'm not saying horror movies need to be big budget, I'm just curious as to why everyone believes story, writing, and acting have to take a backseat instead of riding shotgun along *with* the horror.  




 I dunno. I always felt comedy is the hardest because it's the most subjective and broadest subject. I feel like it's pretty universal what most consider scary and horrific. Sure, there are specific phobias like heights, spiders, the ocean, etc that some find scary that others don't. But I think everyone can agree that murderers, creatures, and being alone in a dark haunted place is scary. I do think however that it's easier to creep people out than to all out scare them. I personally find subtle stuff like shadows moving in the background or footprints leading under the bed far more scarier than "in your face" stuff.  




 Inside, Martyrs, and The Devil's Backbone are fantastic! But Martyrs felt less like a horror movie and more like a depressing drama with horrific things happening to this person. Which I guess now that I've written that out could be considered a horror movie.  




 True, but I feel like with action and rom-coms, we may rarely see great ones, but we kinda consistently see decent ones. Whereas with horror, it's rare to come across even decent ones. Especially horror movies made by big studios.  




 The entirety of Enter the Void feels like a dream sequence because of how surreal it is. 

The shining also has some creepy dream sequences. 

And the obvious choice would have to be Inception.  




 I actually really want to see we are what we are. I hear it's great 




 It was the cult one with all the kids. Or was that the first VHS?

Edit: Yes it was the second one. The segment was titled "Safe Haven." 




 The problem with VHS 2 is that there is really only one part of it that is good and it's only 20 minutes out of an hour and a half.

As for the indie stuff, I agree that there are quite a few that I hear are good but I just don't know how to watch them without buying them. 




 I started thinking about this while browsing the horror section of Netflix. There tends to be a lot more horror movies that are bad compared to other genres. In fact, it's quite rare we see good horror movies anymore. Horror movies tend to hang around a 6 or below on IMDB or a 50 or below on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The most recent good horror movie I can think of is The Conjuring. Which had a great first 3 quarters, but the last quarter turned into a pretty generic possession scene.

Why is this the case? What's the cause of this? Is it the over saturation of them? Is it because they're generally easier to make on a low budget or what? It seems like the only truly good horror movies, with a few exceptions, are foreign now. Is it because most directors/writers/producers believe that story, acting, writing, and character development aren't as important in the horror genre? 




 Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection is considered one of the best Bluray transfers. Also, Samsara is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. 

The Tree of Life is pretty killer as well.

If you want to find out which blurays are worth getting, [blu-ray.com](http://www.blu-ray.com/) has just about every bluray reviewed based on video, audio, and special features. 




 His other brother was also in a movie called Electick Children. A movie about a teen girl who becomes impregnated by rock music. 




 When Ohio is for Lovers came out I thought it was the sickest! 




 I know every lyric to this song. 









 I love Terrence Malick so much! 




 [The Divide](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535616/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

A movie about a group of people who take shelter in a basement after a nuclear attack. As days go by, their mental, emotional, and physical states start breaking down. It's a great scifi drama that focuses on the conflict between these people. Criminally underrated and filled with fantastic acting, music, and cinematography.

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpieSNIfk). Kind of cheesy trailer that doesn't due justice to the movie. 




 I really liked Martyrs. I can't say I enjoyed it obviously. It's something I don't EVER want to watch again, but it's a unique movie and I'm glad I own it. 




 At a 5.8, the lowest I have is The Divide. Not super low because I actively avoid getting bad movies unless I love them. I love this movie. I wouldn't even call it bad. This is a REALLY good sci fi movie. It's about a group of people who retreat into a small bomb shelter during a nuclear war. The more time they spend in the shelter, the crazier and more unhinged they become.

It's not the best movie, but it has some fantastic acting, music, and cinematography. It all takes place in the shelter. Some want to go out. Others obviously don't. Who will break? Who will survive?

This movie also takes some interesting turns as the peoples mental, emotional, and physical state break down.

I came to own it after watching it online. I was looking for something to watch and it looked good, but I was not expecting what I got. After watching it, I had to take some time to let it sink in. It stuck with me days after I saw it. There is a haircut scene that was one of the best scenes of that year. It's a dark, bleak, and emotionally draining movie.

I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi that is more about the human drama and how humans react to disaster and tragedy. It's one of my favorite movies I own and it's so good. 




 1. Memphis, TN

2. August 4

3. I love a good crime movie, also really love surreal and mind bending stuff.

4. Either Spy Kids or Charlie's Angels.

5. Definitely Charlies Angels

6. In The Name of the King

7. I love Terrence Malick, David Fincher, Christopher Nolan, and Coen Brothers. Those are the only directors that I've liked everything they've done.

8. Either Enter the Void, The Thin Red Line, or Tree of Life.

9. As of right now, the bluray of The Chaser. Or a directors collection of any of the directors I listed.

10. Alphabetical of course!

11. Amazon wish list keeps track of the ones I want

[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/h5dec#0) my collection after about a year or so of collecting! Looking forward to adding more!

 




 Enter the Void actually isn't all that disturbing. It's weird, strange, and trippy. It has some uncomfortable scenes, but it's definitely far from being one of the most disturbing films. It's actually a really cool movie from a technical and visual standpoint. 




 His name is Joel David Moore 




 So that's why she was nominated and will probably win. The Oscars just want a story. 




 I kinda agree, but I feel like I don't know enough about cinematography or the production of Gravity to say for sure.  




 Someone in the Golden Globes thread said this about Lawrence, "Her name alone gets her awards." Which I think is totally true.  




 I think while Gravity was remarkable technically, I think it is the weakest contender for best picture. There really isn't a lot of substance there that *I* could see story wise and the writing was okay. But I think the other films are all around great not just technically, but also story wise, acting wise, writing, etc. I just think the other noms are more well rounded. 

That said, Gravity should take all technical awards.  




 I know this movie has gotten a lot of hate, but I thought the cinematography and score in Only God Forgives was fantastic. But I guess there was no way it'd get a nom. 

It would've been nice to see Place Beyond the Pines get a nod, but it's a stiff competition so there was really no room for it. 

All in all though I think there is a good bit of variety this year with the noms. Only thing I wish there was less of is American Hustle.  




 Honestly, I'm quite happy with the nominations. A lot of variety. Of course there are some snubs, there always are. But they did good this year. Only thing I'd like to see less of is American Hustle.  




 I know it's a longshot and was never going to happen, but no cinematography nom for Spring Breakers or Only God Forgives? I know it may not be a good movie but OGF was easily one of the most beautiful movies of the year. Also had a great score.  




 Just a question: Have you met every soldier? 




 You are *literally creating and giving life.* How is that selfish?  




 I believe in God and am a full on Christian, even Mormon. I do *NOT* let my religious and moral beliefs corrupt or interfere with my political or social views in any way. I'm able to separate the two. 




 Yeah I'm with you. I beat my child last week because he was being a fag. I mean, he just kept doing fag stuff. So I beat him and now *I'm* the bad guy? If he didn't want to be beaten then he should've 1) Stopped doing fag stuff, and 2) stood up to me. But he's a fag so obviously he didn't fight back. 




 I dunno dude. I partly agree with you. I was bullied super hard in elementary/early middle school. I'm in my 20s and looking back on it now, I wish I could go back with the spine I have now and put that bully in his place.

But that's kind of the thing. When you're a kid, like really young, you don't really understand that what a bully says isn't true. You're impressionable and you take it to heart. It isn't really until you're in your teens you start to learn to let things roll off your back.

But again, I kind of agree with you. 




 That's not entirely fair. 




 Exactly. There's more to the legalization of marijuana than "Stoners want it." There are plenty of economic benefits that could come from the legalization of marijuana. People who are against it obviously don't understand this and need to separate their own morals from the greater good. 




 It's funny you say you haven't seen any good arguments in favor, but I actually wrote a paper about the legalization of marijuana. I didn't really have an opinion on whether it should be legalized or not, but after discovering the economic benefits of its legalization I'm all for it! 




 I dunno dude. I went to school with a guy who killed himself. He had severe social anxiety as well as aspergers. He couldn't handle social stuff very well. This led to harsh bullying which led to depression. He eventually stopped going to school because he couldn't handle it and one day took his life.

There *are* some people who just are *not* in the right frame of mind.

I don't know though, maybe you're right, but sometimes there *are* other elements at play that mess with your head. Sometimes it isn't just depression. The human mind is a crazy thing. 




 What's the likelihood of running into scams on memphisflyer compared to craigslist?  




 I know I should, but I'm not about to go 45 while everyone around me is going 60-something. The last thing my anxiety needs while driving is people honking at me, yelling at me, and/or riding me. 




 I think something like [this](http://www.inc.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/preview/slideshows/03_9.jpg) may work. With or without the mustache. If you do choose to keep it, trim it on the sides some.

Also, because you have similar features, there's 

[This](http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/wennpic/joel-david-moore-premiere-savages-01.jpg)

Also [this](http://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ENT_JoelDavidMoore_1009.jpg)

Honestly, I'd say go with either the second or third pic, shave the mustache, but keep the stubble. 




 My gamertag is my reddit username. None of my friends play so I rarely play. Would love to play with some people! 




 Same here. I'm not really good at it, but would love to participate. Seems like a lot of fun. 




 DBC? 




 I don't think so. We've seen the labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. 




 But probably not.

Edit: So happy I was wrong. 




 I honestly think it's because there was no more room in the Drama category. 




 So I don't have HBO, but True Detective looks really great. I love detective movies and tv shows. So is there another way I can legally watch True Detective? 









 I'm so glad he did though. I wanted it to be him or Fassbender. 




 Which sucks. I love Jennifer Lawrence but how did it not go to Lupita? 




 Or Lupita 














 Someone mentioned they'd love for Tarantino to do a 60s era spy film. I thought that sounded right in his realm.  




 I'm so excited for another Tarantino movie. But I'm just a little bummed out that it's a western. I love westerns, but I'd much rather see Tarantino do something else in a different time period or location. I'm sure it'll be great though! 




 The body of Henry Cavil and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch. 




  I ordered a PPV movie when I was like 8-10. I thought the dude and chick were conjoined twins. 




 I think because it was one of the first movies to take an extraordinary situation and make it ordinary. Pulp Fiction was one of the first movies to be filled with dialogue and conversations that normal people would have. They were realistic. Not everything they said was important to the story or was dramatic. A lot of people don't like the whole "talk about nothing" style. But I loved it. It made it feel more realistic. In the beginning, Travolta and Jackson aren't talking about anything important or meaningful. They're talking about tv and fast food.

But on top of all that, it's just a well written, well acted, and well directed movie. 




 Hot Wheels.

In a dystopian future, the most popular sport is car racing. But the cars are super fast. Going up to 500 mph. The tracks are filled with crazy turns, jumps, and loops, making it the most dangerous sport. A young man, who has dreamed of being one of the best racers attempts to make his dream a reality. 




 See I don't see Jeremy Renner pulling off the comedy parts. I think he's a perfectly capable actor though. 




 They do actually snort it. It's uncomfortable, but harmless. 




 Like I said, my blue sky analogy sucked and was not meant to be taken literally. Just as a way to put things into perspective.

Well Jesus was whipped and had a crown of thorns placed on his head and, apparently, bled from every pore. He was covered in blood, yet when he was resurrected his scars were gone and the blood was clean from his body.

You're exactly right. We *do* have to consider that maybe other religions are right.

Look, I'm just going to assume that you have no intention of coming to any sort of agreement and you just want to argue. I'm trying to compromise with you, but you won't. I can't tell if you're asking these questions and pointing this stuff out because you actually want explanations or because you're trying to prove that all Gods and religions are all just a lie. So let me know. Are you *really* interested in answers? Are you asking because you want to believe? Or because you want to prove something? 




 I think it depends on what *you* like and also, who you're seeing it with.

I loved Wolf of Wall Street, but depending on who you see it with, it can get pretty uncomfortable. If you're going with family or a girlfriend/boyfriend, I'd say Lone Survivor. But if you're going with a buddy, you can't go wrong with either. I loved Wolf of Wall Street *and* Lone Survivor. But I thought Lone Survivor was more entertaining. That's just me though.

But again, it depends on what you like and who you're seeing it with. 




 It's cliche, but I want to improve my health. I used to be in good shape. Now my pants and shirts are tight, ripped a few pants actually. It makes me sad. I want to lose weight and get back in shape. I want to look and feel good. 




 Jamaica. I didn't feel safe there. Does this make me racist? No one there did anything to make me afraid, but I felt uncomfortable. 

Anyone who has been to Jamaica a few times or lives there know if it's actually dangerous or if it's pretty cool?
