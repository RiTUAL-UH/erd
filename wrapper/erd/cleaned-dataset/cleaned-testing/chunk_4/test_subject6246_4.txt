 I love tea. The problem is that I eat some cake, maybe some cookies or a sandwich (or four) with it. Great tip. Small steps, focus on today, always get back up. Good luck to you too!  




 This is exactly what happened to me. Last year I was home on sick leave because of my depression. I was so tired of always dieting and I felt like I needed to just let go and focus on my mental health. All I did was lay on my couch eating. In some way it felt necessary given the situation I was in but now I'm in a much better place mentally and it is time to focus on my physical health. 

Maybe I shouldn't be afraid to take my time. Those six months will go by either way. I can be the same weight as now or I can take it slow and maybe be 10-20 lbs lighter. 

I love cheese and it actually helps me losing weight. Some parmesan or feta is great in a sallad and doesn't add to much calories. That I can handle. Brie and some crackers is a whole other story... ;) 




 Thank you. You have no idea how much this helps. Focus on today will be my new mantra.  




 That is exactly how I felt when I got pregnant with our oldest five years ago and here I am, still overweight and unhappy. Don't let the years slip away as I did. We can do this!  




 You really hit the nail with this post. I will never change if I keep cheating myself. It will be hard but from now on I'm going to log everything.
