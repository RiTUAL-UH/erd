 Haha Well, yes and no. I've had some fun but I feel like this trip has been devoted to a lot of problem solving in my life. Internally and externally. Dealing with work, goals, relationships (non-romantic), etc. Lots of progress I think (: 




 I'm more of a night person, myself. Plus watching the sunrise is just something I'm accustomed to while tripping now. It's like, The perfect ending. 




 Bloody chapped legs??? Oh man that sounds excruciating! I'd like to hear that story aha Right now I'm chilling, self evaluating. Listening to the new Kendrick Lamar album through. Great album, I appreciate his background and the messages he's trying to convey and the stories and ideas. Maybe that's a bit of a thought loop though, sorry aha  




 Received, friend. Finally relaxing. Coming off a peak. My hands are still jittery so typing is still hard but I'll come back to this post. Thanks guys, this subreddit is like a safe haven for my wandering mind. 




 Ughh, well it was an adventure for sure. First I got in the car and I just thought "Wow, I can be free now. No longer have to keep my cool." Then I realized I'm trapped in a car with two of my closest friends, but also two other people (in the backseat of a 1-door car of course) who I don't know very well. We drive around, oddly enough run into some other mutual friends and then we stopped at 7/11. I asked them to go in for me, gave them the cash and told them what I wanted. Water, cashews, swedish fish. They come back with a fucking gallon of water and the swedish fish. I told them "No! I know there's cashews in there and I have the money!" So I ran in and got the cashews and came back to the car. Then I realized "I'm not getting what I want, I'm getting what I would've got if I was sober". So I was annoyed but it was all fun. Until I discovered we were just going to a place so they could drink. I was less than compliant and I eventually got my friend to take me home. So it was interesting so far, good and bad. Interesting. Sorry, it's so difficult to type but I'll come back to this post in reality. 




 My good friend said he'd call me at 10pm to see if I wanted to get picked up. I still have so much planned for my trip at home though. What should I do? Uncertainty is always exciting, and I think we might going to his really trippy room buuuuuut I did wanna experience a few things first. Like, things I've been saving in my journal for next time I trip. I'm peaking now, so that's the thing. Do I spend my peak with them or with me? Why am I asking reddit this? You guys can't make decisions for me Ahahah But it'd be cool if you could. I'm sorry for the typing too, I feel like it's getting sloppy. It's gross, I hate it man. But whao didn't mean to get negative. 3 3 But yeah, this was an unnecessarily long reply to your comment haha 




 Yeah man, my cat's been giving me funny looks aha And I really thought I almost broke my glasses.. They're fine though haha 

Wow, I forgot how much of a burden typing is while tripping.. 









 I really love your story, I related to some parts of it and I appreciate you sharing it with us. Especially the personal details and self evaluation. I'm definitely saving this and showing it to some friends. 









 Definitely! Spread the word, too. The developers are completely behind it. I think it'll be pretty nice to have a physical copy of both games, plus the comic. And that mixtape will be schweet. Definitely get it, man. 




 Hahahha Dude, I stare in awe when I'm sober so I can only imagine aha 




 Three hits of LSD, I'm not sure the exact dosage. 




 Yeah, I imagine it'll be hard with 2-3 tabs. But I also love puzzles and when I trip I can just figure them out a lot easier. Hotline Miami is really like a puzzle game, in a sense, so that would be cool. The fast paced aspect could go either way, sometimes I can focus really well but if I'm tripping hard it'll all be really blurry. I'd still like to try just for the story aspect alone. 




 I have been waiting a very long time to do this. Can't wait. 




 Finally have a chance to play these games while tripping. Can't fuckin' wait! Could be incredible and terrifying at the same time. Especially when the "Richard" music plays aha I will report back with my experience! 




 That's interesting, actually. I might enjoy this myself if I knew where to go haha 




 I'm also an audiophile myself, so that's all under control haha I might actually look at some books in the library. I always loved flipping through encyclopedia's when I was a kid.
