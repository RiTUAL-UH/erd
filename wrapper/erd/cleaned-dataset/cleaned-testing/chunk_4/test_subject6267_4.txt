 VPN- I use Onavo Protect which is pretty decent, I can use social media and YouTube fairly well on it. I think its free in the Apple App Store 




 Really? I found that it disappeared so fast, maybe it would be better on top of a cream highlighter like the Topshop Glow... 









 Do you have Sleek's contour kit? They are amazing, so easy to use and there is more contour powder than highlighter (is it just me who runs out of contour first?). This can be hard to track down but they're definitely in the Marble Arch Superdrug or Oxford Circus Boots.

MUA matte lipsticks are very good for the extremely cheap price, they last fairly well for a matte but can be quite drying but less than MAC's Ruby Woo.

I really recommend popping into a TK Maxx if you happen to pass one, they often have great stuff, not necessarily exclusive to the UK but they're really cheap. They often have stuff from Nails Inc, OPI, Japonesque, Ecotools and loads of skincare bits too. 




 I saw this in store the other day, the pastel colours look amazing! 




 Has anyone else tried this highlighter? I finally managed to hunt it down in Superdrug the other day, swatched it on my inner wrist and proceeded to wander around the store. About 5 mins later, I looked at my wrist and the intense shimmer had faded to the subtlety of the Hourglass Ambience Lighting powders! 

I have seen blogs saying its comparable to the Mary-Loumanizer but I was so disappointed when I tried this one out, it looked so incredible in the pan :( 




 Hear hear! Except I'm here like every 2 hours now that summer has started... 




 I agree, I put on my CosRX BHA A-Sol, BHA Blackhead Power and Mizon AHA and the acids huuuurrrrrttttt. Its a stinging akin to the sing you get from a spot treatment.  




 Have you tried the UD primer potion, if you have, would you recommend this over it? It looks great, but I'm trying to decide if the shipping hassle is worth it, haha 




 No worries, thank you anyway! I'm a #23 in Mishha's Perfect cover so this one is probably a little too light for me :(

I have heard that Innisfree's shades runs slightly lighter than other cushions though, which is quite odd 




 Can I ask what skin tone you are e.g. foundation or MAC no. and which shade of the Innisfree cushion you got? I really want to get a cushion but am unsure of which to get, this water glow one looks amazing though! 




 Ohhhh I'm really interested in that one! Is it similar in texture to the Missha at all? 




 So since I have finally finished my last A-Level exam today, I thought it would be good time to start reviewing some products I bought last month. Today: a review on Missha's Super Aqua Detoxifying Peeling Gel. 

**What is it and how is it used?** A physical exfoliant that is applied onto a dry face and requires massaging/rubbing gently until the product 'pills', then rinse off.

**First impression?** I REALLY like the scent of this. If you like Lancme's Miracle perfume smells like, then YAAAAASS, this is amazing. Its a very light floral scent that dissipates as soon as you rinse it off.

The first time I tried it, I felt like it did absolutely nothing but then I realised you do have to use a fair bit; I used about a 4cm length of the product for just my forehead.

**Does it do what it says on the tin?** Yes..... but it won't get rid of any large flakes. If you have slightly dry skin that requires some physical exfoliation and you find the St. Ives apricot scrub too harsh, you may like this better. However, if you have any scabs or large flakes on your skin, this won't do very much for that and using a muslin cloth during cleansing may be more effective. This product doesn't clean out blackheads as well as the St. Ives one does, due to the smaller exfoliating beads.

**Anything else?** This also reminded of the Este Lauder Pore Refiner in terms of texture, its very fine and the granules are so small. You also have to stand in front of the sink for this product, the more you massage it in, the more it pills and the bits become larger until you rinse it off. (Imagine scrubbing your body to exfoliate all the dirt and grub off and bits of dead skin rolls forming *sorry* but on a much smaller scale) 

**Repurchase?** Yes, it works well in conjunction with my chemical exfoliants and does the job without being too harsh on my skin.

I hope you've found this useful, hopefully I can do another one of these on the Blackhead Melting Oil soon! 




 I only realised today that my mother will be coming home from a 3 month work trip from Beijing at the end of this month and I wanted to source some AB products for her to use to welcome her home.

She's in her mid 40's and has quite dehydrated skin that can do with some plumping and tone correction (she has freckles due to careless sun exposure) as well as some bags under her eyes. She currently uses stuff like Estee Lauder's Advanced Night Serum, Lancme's Genfique eye cream and moisturiser. When she gets home, I plan on getting her started in chemical exfoliation and maybe some yeast products?....

At home, we currently have:

* Mizon's AHA 8% serum
* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid
* CosRX Snail 96 Mucin
* Mizon's Snail Recovery Gel
* SAP Vitamin C serum

If you guys can recommend some products to get her into, I'd really appreciate it and I'm sure she will too! Thank you in advance!

 I'm really curious about the EH BB cushion as I haven't heard too much about it, please do let us know how it goes! 




 Maybe try some vegan places to eat out? I know a place thats vegetarian/vegan that was started by Buddhists. Its not cheap but you can probably order some dishes, I remember a lot of their 'mock meat' food was made out of Bailinggu, a type of mushroom. 

Other than that, its probably wisest to eat at home. 




 YAAAAASSSS, so excited for this! 




 Also not AB but O'Keefe's Working Hands Cream (pretty sure its on Amazon, definitely is in the UK). 

This stuff will heal cracked hands, split fingertips and everything. If you don't mind some chemicals (its got paraffin) it really does a great job overnight and you can reapply during the day as its not sticky or oily at all. Its got a very light paraffin smell to it, but is completely unnoticeable unless you sniff your hands. 




 I seriously agree with you both and trust me I would, but the exams that determine whether or not I enter Medicine in university are tomorrow through to next Wednesday and the stress is getting to me.

I do take on board your advice though and will get on it once these exams are done! 




 Yeah I agree, although my friends and siblings (read cousins, since I am Chinese) all like to try Belgian beers there too.

I believe the team currently ahead in Lush's pub quiz are called 'The Boner Condoners' so I totally get what you mean.
