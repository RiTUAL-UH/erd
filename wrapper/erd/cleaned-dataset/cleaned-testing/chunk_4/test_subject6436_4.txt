 I read this peer reviewed study and others like it. This 470nm light is produced by the blue spectrum hydroponic bulb. 




 "Don't eat bats". Thank you for the heads up. LOL 




 I agree with you. There is news stories of the mid-ages recipe of cow bile mixed with garlic.  




 I am not worried.  I have ideas though my new theory of multiple factor science which could make the pharmaceutical drug companies a lot of money. I am not religious but like this quote one  of  Martin Luther King Jk speechs.

" I"m happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing anyman. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord !" 




 You are not the first person too confuse the two.  




 I agree but still like video 




 I wish it was that simple but it doesn't work like that.  




 So you think his man boobs is the reason the polar bear is not interested in eating him .lol 




 Great.  




 He is such a good boy.  




 If that happens, it will probably be quick.  




 Thank you. Bleach baths don't work for me also. Wish you a MRSA free future. If your immune system figured out a way to get rid of it, you will be immune from mrsa in the future.  




 The common assumption is that man domesticated wolf's not that man and wolf affected each others evolution.  We would not even be the same form most likely if it wasn't for dogs and wolfs. Some even go so far as to think that wolf domesticated man not vise versa. I would not go this far. I think we domesticated each other. 




 Also check out my video of a retired microbiologist commenting on my mrsa treatment idea. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1nITz-sww 




 Cool. I am serious about changing the way that mrsa is treated.  




 Did you check out my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine video.

 Research 400nm light then look at the spectrograph of the hydrolux blue 1000watt grow bulb. 




 I tried manuka honey and colloidal silver. Both didn't work for me. May work for some people though. Everyone is different. 




 Even though I treat my reoccurring mrsa with my method, about a month ago I saw an infectious disease specialist too see why I was getting reoccurring mrsa infections so often. She told me my reoccurring mrsa was most likely not from an external source but rather lived on my skin. She also told me , assuming it didn't kill me first, my body would eventually figure out a way to remove it from my system. I could have no more outbreaks or a 100 more outbreaks. Sounds as if you your doctor found proper drug plus your body figured out how to get rid of it. Good luck. 




 Glad you are ok now. You are  lucky to be alive. What drug did the CDC give you. Been on vancimyicn 3 times. Rough stuff. 




 Not sure what you are saying. Explain. 




 That's cool. MRSA does grow fast and is not a joke. You could use this method in  conjunction with antibotics if you were worried about this alone not being effective. 




 This man has guts. 




 I hope not but this could happen. Just hope bear don't have a bad day.  




 Yep. Got the idea. 









 Must obey hal.  




 Combining 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, bezethonium cloride mixed with epson salt, and alternation hot and cold.  Go to Blackwell synergy, a peer review search engine, and research each of these ideas. Each of these ideas have been peer reviewed to help with MRSA infections. It is combining all three ideas together and geting the 400nm light from a hydroponic grow bulb that is my idea  and has produced such a rapid and effective respose. People have claimed to treat mrsa infections with 12 watt blue spectrum LEDs. It may work for some people but was a failure for me. My idea, which no one is currently doing, is to obtain the blue spectrum light from a 1000w hydroponic grow bulb. Combining this with the two other methods produced a rapid and effective response to my reoccurring mrsa infections. Before this method, I treated over a dozen mrsa infections with antibotics. After inventing this method, I treated my last three mrsa infections with this combination method and without antibotics. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. Hope this helps. 




 Never heard of them. Thank you for suggestion. 




 I e-mailed over 500 microbiologists worldwide including every microbiologist at OSU. Had a couple of responses but was told the FDA would never approve of this idea even if it worked. The learned helplessness of PHD doctors was shocking. 




 Would like the medicial community to do a research study on this combination MRSA treatment. It is not science until it can be replicated in many different people. Then this scientific research could be submitted for peer review. This is my dream. Inspired by Dr. Jonas Salk and a special French woman. 




 Manuka honey didn't work for me but it may for some people. This is the reason pharmaceutical drug trials are done on so many people. What works for some people doesn't work for others. 
  




 Don't know much about it. New research project for tonight.
 




 Is that the treatment used in Russia.  




 Agreed.  




 On youtube there is a dozen other video's. Videos are under patent-free MRSA. Read book "Missing Microbes" and read about the negative effects of antibotics. 




 Thank you for feedback. 




 Thank you for link. 









 Need other options in the democratic party besides Hillary Clinton. 




 Taxi drivers not doing there cause any favors. I am sure more french citizens will use uber just because of this poor behavior of taxi drivers. 









 Awesome.  
























 Thank you.
