 You have a lot of Jesus says in that paragraph. If Jesus is preaching a trinitarian god, different from the unitary one previously revealed, why should we believe him? 




 I have answers, I'll type them up when off mobile.

Edit: Ok, let's break this down. I'm not going to address whether this Psalm is messianic or not, but the claim that the Messiah is also God. First, a readable text:

2              

3          

4     

5         

6        

7        

8            

9       

10        

The first five verses are saying the king (or the hero of the king perhaps) is strong, righteous and blessed by God, and so will defeat the kingdom's enemies. Simple enough, and it could be referring to the Messiah if you look at it the right way. Then, right after the enemies are defeated:

7        

There are a few different translations that could work here for the first half of the verse.

You throne, God, is established for eternity,

OR

Your heavenly/divine/majestical (lit: of God) throne is established for eternity,

The translation clearly goes by the second. The verse, like many in Hebrew poetry, has two halves which parallel one another. The second half says "your scepter of kingship is a scepter of fairness." Both describe an object that has two properties. The first has a godly and everlasting throne, the second has a scepter that symbolizes kingship and fairness. The parallel breaks down if you say that  addresses God. It is an adjective, not a noun. Note that the Christian English translation writes it that the verses are broken up differently to obscure this.

8            

You have loved justice and hated wickedness, therefore, God--your God--has anointed you with oil of mirth beyond that of your friends" (friends could also be kinsmen).

The confusion comes from how the verse is punctuated; , your God, is actually a descriptor of , God. **The person addressed is not named in this or in any other verses of the psalm.** Why can't the verse be read like you translated above? Because the noun following the verb must be the subject, not the object, of the sentence. In addition, the object is already a part of the verb. Literally, it reads:

Anointedyou, God yourGod, oil...

The lack of spaces is deliberate in order to demonstrate how the grammar is written. The verb/object is the first word, and the subject-adjective are the second and third words. There is only one direct object contained in that phrase, not two.

Therefore, the person being addressed (perhaps the Messiah) has been (figuratively) anointed by God and given a godly throne. The next two verses describes his other blessings that he receives after conquering. There is no double God hinted at here.

P.S. Yes,  can also mean judge, FYI, like in Deutoronomy 17. 




 **That's the problem.** why should we change to a thread text which throws away the old when the latter tells us this is the exact situation we should avoid? 




 OK, under that criteria bar-kochva is the messiah, and he'll finish when he comes back any day now. He certainly got further than Jesus did. Why do you think he's not the Messiah and Jesus is? 




 And I'm not entirely sure how I got into this conversation in the first place :/

You posted in a thread about OT prophecies, so I'm not sure what you were expecting! :P and I know nothing about the epistles, so it's OK.

Can you explain to me the difference?  

Sure. Since annointing someone was standard practice when they were raised to a position of authority, (king, priest, etc.). So these are all "anointed ones" or messiahs. The term The Messiah, the one who would lead Israel to redemption, came from the fact that the Jews had no self governing leaders for a long time, and thus no anointed ones. So it came to mean "the one who will be anointed" when the Jews are free.

I'll get to the rest when I'm off mobile. 




 Look at this thread on /r/debatereligion to see that logic in action. 




 In my mind, the definitive way to tell if Jesus was the Jewish Messiah would be to compile a list of all the Messianic prophecies and compare them to Jesus' life as documented in both the New Testament and in secular sources and see if he fulfilled every single one of them.

Luckily for you, this has been done before. Jesus did not fulfill the most obvious prophecies. /r/Judaism/wiki/jesus

Edit: Oh God, that site is awful. I'll take the time to debunk it if you respond here. 




 The trinity is not found in the Bible. They are one in purpose, but not in being.

Oh right, you're Mormon. Well, that's even worse, honestly. "You shall have no other gods before me."

 I believe that that verse is one of the songs of the suffering servant, is that not correct? 

That's right.

Is there anything about the Messiah that claims he is not a servant of the Lord? Messiah, after all, just means "anointed one".

First, there are two different meanings of messiah -- an anointed one, used a lot in the historical parts of the Bible, and **the** Messiah, which is used is some of the prophets. I've found that Christians often confuse the two.

Second, of course the Messiah will be a servant of God. That doesn't mean that this prophecy is about the Messiah, like it is claimed. :P Why do you think is specifically about the Messiah as opposed to anyone else?

I think this is talking about the children of Israel, not the Messiah. A previous write up of mine:

 Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

 Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

 Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.
 
 









  Jesus was, after all, an unlearned Jew

Wait, I thought it was claimed he was a rabbi?

I don't find the argument that they're pulling things out of context to pull the wool over those unfamiliar with the prophecies convincing.

I wouldn't find it convincing either, except for the preponderance of evidence. I don't see any other way there are so many seemingly deliberate mistakes.

looking at the context of those verses and finding it ambiguous whether or not it is referring to the messiah. 

Do you want to discuss one or more you find particularly strong or noteworthy? It's why I made the rebuttal in the first place.
 




 It's only talked about when Israel is killing them. It's ignored otherwise. 




 [Here's one](http://christianity.about.com/od/biblefactsandlists/a/Prophecies-Jesus.htm) that's been linked to three times on this forum that I've seen. [Here's](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/messianicprophecies.html) a second I've seen once. I've refuted them but have yet to see someone respond to my comment.

First debunking:

  

 I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.
 
 Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,
 
 Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,
 
 About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18
 
 Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)
 
 Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.
 
 To break the last category down for further discussion:
 
 Torah: 1, 15, 36
 
 Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44
 
 Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29
 
 Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39

Second dubunking:

 Correct: 7/8 (see disputations about genealogy),
 
 Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
 
 About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 13, 14
 
 Psalms: 12, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23/24, 25/26, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45
 
 Not about the Messiah: 9, 10, 11, 14, 18 (all Isaiah sources), 20, 21, 25/26/27/28, 29/31/40, 30, 32/33,
 
 About the Messianic age, not the Messiah: 14, 15, 16, 19
 
 Not a prophecy: 1, 35, 36

 




 What is Russia? I would have to learn the history of that country and region. Then the concepts of socialism and communism to understand the rise of the ussr and its leaders. Then how Russia got control of those countries behind the "Iron curtain." This would take me 2-3 hours at least, even granting that I already knew the terms contained within those articles.

I could go on, but you see how much background knowledge (memorization) you need just to read one sentence about the Cold War, let alone why it began. 




 I think it's pretty clear that it does not mean the city when looked at in the broader context.

My thought is that since Jesus didn't fulfill the messianic prophecies, the Gospel writers had to make up plausible sounding ones to convince people that he was actually the messiah. This, among lots of others, fit, so they took it out of context and (mis)used it. I've seen at least two lists of these "prophecies" recently, and the vast majority of the items are incorrect. 




 All of this requires concepts you only know through memorization. From a perspective of someone who knows the language but never encountered these terms before:

Was it the Soviets (who are they?), who reneged on their agreements (what were these agreements?) to allow the people of Eastern Europe (where is this in comparison to soviet? how many people are there? what is the culture?) to determine their own fates (were they kept locked in dungeons? what was their fate?) by imposing totalitarian rule (what kind of rule is this?) on territories unlucky enough to fall behind the "Iron Curtain?" (did the soviets hang a curtain around eastern europe?)
 




 Jesus never called His disciples to follow other gods. All of His ministry pointed towards the father.

The trinity is a "god not known", for God revealed himself as a perfect unity, which Jesus then changed to a trinity.

The Jews were also expecting a miraculous Savior to rise to the throne and free them from the Romans.

uh, yes, because that is what the prophecies say will happen. Jesus didn't do that. 




 What do you mean?  




 No, it says that the Messiah will be born of Bethlehem-Ephratah, the area where David was from. It is just another way of saying david's lineage. 




 What do you think the civilian casualty rate will be in the latest bombing campaign? 50%? 80%? And will it be by the American standard of any male between 16-40 is a combatant?

More importantly, will anyone talk about it when Israel isn't killing them? 




 Poe's law in action... 




 You might benefit from the use of E-Prime.

Yeah, sometimes that happens when I write quickly...

the only possible interpretation, and anybody who sees it differently is just crazy

...but I don't think I said this. On the other hand, I do believe I have the correct interpretation, and since this is a debate forum I state my opinion strongly and expect a strong rebuttal. 




 lol, ok 




 He never said that, just that these elements are present in Judaism. Which is true.

But they aren't used to coerce people to do anything, so it doesn't bear resemblance to the threat of hell and heaven in Christianity. 

Judaism includes Satan. Whether or not that is the "main point" of Satan in Judaism is subjective, and as a believing Jew, you'll prefer strongly an interpretation which favors Judaism.

You're still not getting it. It's not that satan isn't a main part -- it's that there is no "trickster to explain contrary evidence." The accuser does not have that role. Read the end of Job -- the point is that everything comes from God.

What religion, you mean. Certainly many do. But what is relevant for the purposes of this discussion is that Judaism includes this element.

I said group on purpose. I'm pointing out this element doesn't matter because nearly all groups, not just religions, have included this principle.


The way Jewish children are taught

I'm still not getting it. What is this "way"?

 I am not convinced it was designed to spread virally in as cynical and overt a way as Christianity was

That's because Judaism was never intended for that. Judaism is for the Jews -- or rather, Judaism is the religion for tribe of the children of Jacob, of which Judah was a remnant. It does not look to expand to other people; though it claims to have a supreme God, it also teaches that God made a special covenant for the Jewish people that only applies to them.

 




 Are not things written by prophets to be considered prophetic?

No. Take the absurd example: a prophet's tax bill is not a prophecy, yet he still wrote it. Not *all* things written by a prophet are prophetic.

I showed that some Jews did consider them to be so. 

No, you showed a Messianic splinter sect considered them to be so, relating the Psalms to themselves. Interestingly, "a Messianic splinter sect" is exactly what Christianity was at the time, so I was noting that they both used the same technique of taking random verses and applying them to the present day.

Why quote any of the psalms, then, if no Jews thought that they were prophetic?

As I said above, because it's a common Messianic tactic. See how easy it was to make you believe that because it is holy it is also a prophecy if you read it the right way?

I'm not quite sure what you mean. I have been citing websites as I go--perhaps you just missed those links.

Your original pesher link. It would be nice to get a link which has sources, or even better, a scholarly paper. After that, we can talk about the actual meaning of pesher.
 




 Hey, you asked, I answered.
 




 If you contact the Rabbi or another person in the leadership before the holiday, they will probably give you one. 




 At the time of Jesus' life, some of the Psalms are considered to be prophetic, because some of them are written by David.

You have not demonstrated that this is *because* they were written by David. In addition, you have only quoted one splinter sect of Judaism, who happened to be messianic as well (like Christianity). These types of groups in general like to take unrelated writings and interpret them in light of the present day. Can you demonstrate anyone mainstream thought of Psalms as prophetic?

Also, please quote a website with actual links. That could be made up as far as we know, but I'm reserving judgement for now. 




  He always went on and on about how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies

Also not true, fyi. There have been debates here before, and it usually comes down to "Jesus will fulfill all of them in the second coming." 




 Rav Kook and his followers, at the very least, are pretty famous. 




 It's the list again! I choose you, copypaste!

I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.

Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18

Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)

Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.

To break the last category down for further discussion:

Torah: 1, 15, 36

Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44

Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29

Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39
 




 4 .- Unverifiable reward if you act in a certain way.

5 .- And/or unverifiable punishment if you do not act in a certain way.

Neither of these points are relevant. Reward/punishment in the afterlife is not the main motivator to do miztvot.

6 .- Invisible trickster to explain away contrary evidence.

Doesn't exist as explained above.

3a .- Promote marriage between believers, within the faith, and have large family.

What group does NOT do this?

3b .- Indoctrination.

Want to explain what you mean? Judaism traditionally teaches a lot of critical thinking. Why do you think so many Jews become lawyers?
 




 What does this have to do with the Messiah? (Your translation is also awful, but we can get to that later.) 




 The same reason you don't analyze homer and at the same time discuss whether it actually happened. Every discussion needs to have axioms, or it goes nowhere. If you want to discuss the veracity of the text, make your own topic. 




 Nope. Being the messiah has nothing directly to do with God. 




 And Jesus didn't exist either, but we're discussing everything as if they're recorded accurately. We don't have to turn every discussion into a debate on the authenticity of the text.  




 A little bit. But they are generally well received or ignored, and they don't press if you refuse. 




 This is not converting, it's more like bringing lapsed Catholics back into the church. 




  Disclaimer: I'm not a Jew, so I might have misinterpreted my Jewish friends' answers to this question.

Nope, this is good. 

 




 I'll break it down point by point.

isn't Israel a specifically Jewish state,

Yes, much in the same way England is Anglican.

But aren't Zionists mostly European immigrants

I don't know what you mean by Zionists here; if you mean Jewish Israelis, it's about evenly split between Ashkenazim and Sefardim/Mizrachim, although the distinction is slowly disappearing.

isn't Zionism not much older than 100 years old?

Zionism, the ideology that Jews should create a state of their own to escape persecution is about 150 years old now, yes. The Jewish longing to return to the "land of Israel" is 2000 years old.

 So up until just over a hundred years ago, waiting for the coming of the messiah before founding a state was something specifically about being Jewish, right?

Yes and no. Before the Enlightenment, there wasn't a concept of "setting up a state." A king ruled a territory, and the Messiah would be a new king who re-established the Kingdom of Israel. There is a thought (it's only one opinion) that Jews should not attempt to self-govern until we are worthy, which will be when the Messiah comes. But there is a tension here: how would you recognize the Messiah if you refuse to attempt to gather in from exile?

It all just seems paradoxical because Zionists seem like reformists

Do you mean Reform, as in Reform Judaism? No, most of the early Zionists were secular, not reform, though there was a significant religious minority involved in the early zionist movement. Most of the Reform movement actually criticized Zionism quite a bit before WWII, since their ideologies were so strongly opposed to one another.

and if we create a Jewish state, it seems like the reformists should have less of a say than the orthodox

They did. Israel is a mostly secular Jewish state, just like England.

but the orthodox don't want the state

No longer true. Many Haredim in Israel are disapproving of the state and try and undermine it, but many others support it. There are many other "Modern Orthodox"/Daati Leumi who are very much Zionists. Both of these groups vote and therefore get a say in running of the state in proportion to their vote.

so we shouldn't listen to them on religious grounds, but its a specifically Jewish state.

These two points have nothing to do with each other.

 Its not like Protestants have much of a say on what happens in the Vatican, but even if they did the Catholics should have first say

Bad analogy. These are two different religious groups, not a religious and a secular group.

I mean if an Orthodox Jewish state is contradictory to the original tenants of Judaism, 

It's not in any way contradictory. There is one opinion saying that Jews shouldn't attempt to return on their own, and I already discussed the tension inherent in it.

then is it still a Jewish state, or just a state obsessed with ethnic purity?

Why do you think Israel is obsessed with ethnic purity more than any other country. About 20% of the population is not Jewish. In addition, Israel is still a Jewish (or more accurately, Israelite) state even if it has no religious laws, just like England is an ethnically English state.

...Unless its just an ethnically Jewish state, in which case wouldn't all orthodox Jews outside of Israel become defacto diaspora?

It is an ethnically Jewish state. And yes, all orthodox Jews consider themselves in the diaspora, but that has nothing to do with the state. 




 None of your points here are accurate. 




 Judaism was founded at the exodus and revelation, not by Abraham. He was apparently a great person who brought a lot of good to the world, including monotheism, but Judaism came later. Nor did he or does he fill a savior role (a concept which doesn't really exist in judasim).

Judaism is not, and never has been, a monastic religion. Abraham was famously wealthy, and the Israelites took lots of gold out of Egypt. 

Judaism is a communal religion which doesn't work without family.

There are no rewards for believing or disbelieving, only doing.

There is no trickster. The satan, or accuser, is best likened as a malicious prosecuter in court.

There is no apocalyptic event, only a redemption. 




 This does not apply at all to Judaism.  




 Huh? The whole state of Judaism is waiting for their Messiah to return Israel to its glory.

Not true.

they rejected Jesus because the Messiah came to save the whole world, not just the Jews.

Also not true. 

From below: 

Who are "they"? The Jews prophesied about a Messiah. Read Isaiah especially. He prophesied of a coming Messiah who would be rejected by his own people.

Three strikes, and yoooooou're out!

Is it? Christianity started in Judea and was brought to Rome. And Asia. And Africa. All within the first century. 

Not very impressive, considering you could travel for 5 days and reach any of these continents.

It is not based on the wisdom of a Roman emperor; it is based on the life and teachings of a middle-eastern Jewish rabbi who claimed to be the son of God, and Christ came for everyone, not just Western society.

No, it was based on Paul and early Catholic church, which was established in (guess where?) Rome! 




 I think they're one seat lower than Yesh atid now. 




 Do you want to have a discussion about your points? 




 Yes, it exists, though most people when trying to use it ask improperly. It is usually not formal though. For example, we had to get a passing non-Jew to turn off the oven. 




 Why not? 




 Because those rockets were fired, dimwit. Read the godam article. The false alarm was this morning, which hasn't been reported anywhere.
 




 Wrong verse. [Numbers 23:19] 




 Not a ger myself, but it is probably because it happens so often outside of deep/personal conversations. I can see how it gets annoying, and somewhat implies that you don't belong. 




 Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions. 




 Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions. 




 But of course, when we calmly and positively talk about having sex with a three year old

That you say this means you are completely misunderstanding the entire section. This is a legal discussion, not a code of conduct. 




 No, these were people and their descendants who were there in 1920-1950, and had been living there for hundreds of years. Does the same principle apply? 




 The right of return isn't about returning to a country, it's about returning to what is rightfully your home.

If you acquiesce to thousands of Haredi Jews returning under this definition to Hebron and Jerusalem, as well as all the Mizrachi Jews and their descendents to their homes in the Arab world, I might start taking you seriously. Until then... 




 Oh, I think it's an awful practice that should be stopped, outside of a few people who the community itself should support as well. I probably would have voted for Yair Lapid in the last Israeli election, who advocated and passed a measure to slowly change this.

I think that it is justified in that it is not viewed as stealing; if the state will provide for them to engage in studying, they'll take it. Work is not valued in the intrinsic way that it is in much of Western society, and learning Torah is much more important than contributing (or stealing) from the country. 




 Actually, from my limited knowledge, this is not a very common practice in America. Many people do study at yeshiva, yes, but not their entire life. The practice is much more widespread and pronounced in Israel. 




 I've just been recommended Hearthstone by a friend. I'm a previous casual Magic player -- I know the basic rules, mechanics, and strategies, but never bothered building my own deck because it was too much of hassle, so I didn't play very often. 

What should I know going into the Hearthstone? What are the similarities and differences to Magic, and what should I be expecting? A basic overview would be nice! Thank you! :) 




 Once palestine is established, you will have the right of return to Palestine just as Jews have the right to return to Israel.

 Mewtwo has finally decided, as Mew taught him, that violence is not the answer. He was invited to join both Brawl and Sm4sh (which is why the data was in brawl), but declined in order to instead pursue his peaceful, meditative existence on a secluded island. He spends his days catching up with old friends via telepathy and pondering ways to end violence among both humans and Pokemon. Though I loved playing with him in Melee, I hope he can continue to live at peace with himself. :)

But if you want eternal friendship, all the internet hugs, or just someone to chat with, I'm your guy. :) I'll also smash with you whenever you want! A PM with a code would be eternally appreciated, but if not, you have a blast playing it early!

 Try calling them now and explaining your situation/begging for it! It seems to have worked for other people!

P.S. If you do get it, I would appreciate one of the other 3!

 A steam game? Eternal friendship? All the internet hugs? 




 If anyone could give me an NA code, I'll give you free hugs! 




 If someone would be so kind to take pity on me, I would be so, so grateful! Eternal friendship in exchange for an NA code! 




 If there is an amazingly kind would who would be willing to give out an NA code, I will be eternally grateful! 




 If a really kind hearted person would give me an NA code, I would be ever so greatful and I would be your friend forever! 




 Hasn't that been the position on the left for quite some time?

 Exactly what they got out of it this time. Sequence of events:

* Hamas kidnaps and kills teenagers
*  Israel cracks down on Hamas members in the West Bank and starts sweeping manhunt
* Hamas uses this as an excuse to start bombarding southern Israeli residents with rockets
* Israel responds with limited airstrikes and proposes a few quiet-for-quiet agreements
* Hamas rejects these, as well as proposed ceasefires, while saying that it is responding to Israeli aggression; Israel begins official military operation
* Palestinians, militants and civilians, die, as well as a few Israeli civilians
* Ground invasion commences, after Hamas attacks from tunnels, with the purpose eliminate those tunnels; 
* Hamas gets the opportunity to kill and kidnap soldiers, and put many more Palestinian civilians at risk during the fighting
* Israeli ground invasion concludes and ground troops withdraw after tunnels destroyed, as Israel declines to commence a full invasion to eliminate Hamas
* Hamas continues firing rockets, and Israel continues attacking by air
* Hamas accepts a ceasefire once they are close to running out of rockets

The potential and real accomplishments of starting a fight with Israel:

* Increased popularity, both at home and abroad, especially vis a vis Fatah
* Increase donations by terror funders (i.e. Qatar) and well meaning countries and individuals
* Dead Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Captured Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Potential for a massacre of Israelis through fighters emerging from tunnels
* Dead Palestinian civilians to show to the world
* Dead Palestinian militants to show as civilians to the world
* Pressure on Israel to ease blockade 
* Increase support for the right wing in Israel

I could go on, if you want more. It's theorized this round of fighting started now to weaken the unity government/Fatah as well as get more money, since civil servants weren't being paid due to lack of funds. 
 




 Can you go into more detail as to why regular electric watches are allowed? 




 To clarify, it is a law not to eat animals not slaughtered properly, which has the side effect of also avoiding animals which die by disease. 




 No. 




 Nonono, you don't understand, I posted that to make people think I'm a real person instead of a paid shill! And you're my sockpuppet that I made to point it out! Get your act together, man! 









 Nope, it's actually pretty much the translation above, though of course a lot of nuance is lost. 




 I'm saying that the translation is wrong. The text is not talking about a spiritual disease which no longer exists, not the medically defined leprosy of today. 




 It would be. But we're not discussing leprosy. 




 Oh, you have every right to think that it's ridiculous. Just know what it is that you're criticizing.  




 Some few kibbutzim are still doing well. 




  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.

It's a spiritual disease caused by gossip, and it has a spiritual cure.  




 the punishment for breaking any of them is execution.

Not true.

 It's not goddam leprosy! 




 Whether it is or is not, you didn't write the trivial part.
