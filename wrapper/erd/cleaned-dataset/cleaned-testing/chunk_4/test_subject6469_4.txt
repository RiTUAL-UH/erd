 Hi,all. I have no money,no jobs. So I made web app which named Trick Star thanks to Flask.

This web service is made to found videos in youtube's videos for programmer by Github's star count.

If you are want to be innovator of this service, I want you to upload good videos.

This service is still beta, so if you have any feedback or idea , please sent email to  me (test_subject6469@gmail.com) or leave comment,please.
