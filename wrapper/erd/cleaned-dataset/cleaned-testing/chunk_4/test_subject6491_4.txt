 I'm actually all for it. I think prison should be voluntary. And if someone doesn't want serve his sentence, his citizenship is revoked, and he's exiled to some island.  




 Bob Dylan always had this anti establishment side in him. 

Obama on meeting Bob Dylan:

 Heres what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as youd expect he would be. He wouldnt come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didnt want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didnt show up to that. He came in and played The Times They Are A-Changin. A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage  Im sitting right in the front row  comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it  then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: Thats how you want Bob Dylan, right? You dont want him to be all cheesin and grinnin with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.  




 But studios are exactly that! They are *active* VC that specialized in music and also have connections to help the business they invest in. What he means is that he's looking for *passive* investors. But that's gonna be a very risky business to be in.

 Have you ever seen art students or amateur artists sitting in a museum im front of a panting, trying to draw it? You are saying they aren't allowed to do that. That I can't draw at home Le Reve and hang it on my wall. That if I can buy parts and build a Mustang, I'm not allowed to do that and put it in my yard. 

That I can't take a guitar, play Stairway to Heaven and keep the recording. Because someone owns those sound waves and I can't move the air on the same way without paying him.

I'm not sure I agree with that. 




 Here's a case for this being a 'right'.

You buy a pencil, you buy paper. You can draw on that paper whatever you want with your pencil. It's your property, it's your right.

You have 5 rooms in your house, you can turn them on and off in any way you like. You can light 2 rooms or 4 rooms. It's your house, your light, your right.

You have a harddrive with billions of bits. You can turn them on and off any way you want. It's your HD, your bits, your pc. BUT if you arrange your bits in a sequence that is similar (not even identical) to a song or a movie or a book, you suddenly break the law and it's not right anymore. Change the first bit, you are golden, change the 10th bit, immoral.

Digital copyright is basically saying someone owns that sequence of bits. Someone owns a number, and you can't copy that number.

 




 Why not switch to digital? Who owns the copyright?

 Also, don't forget free, functioning and competing matkets in most areas and most states. Businesses that were waiting on the opportunity to start working again and great universities that resumed civil research almost instantly.

 I simply don't know, and I think it's well within the realm of possibility.   




 Southpark did a funny episode on that. People watching stream of people commenting on players commenting on games. 




 Upvoting it was the right thing to do. 




 Kodak can be the opposite example. And anyway, I'm not saying the company will fail, but they can be merged with another big company (let's say, for the sake of argument, LG or Samsung mobile) and call themselves somthing else.  




 But Microsoft doesn't need to be replaced. It can be merged, split or rebrand for the name to be forgotten. We are talking 50 years here, that's eternity in tech terms.

The name Microsoft doesn't have much value. It's not even a popular website or a product (vs. Windows, Office and such). 




 Why is that? 




 You are counting moves, where most of those calculations are referring to *boards* or *games*. You can move your piece backward and forward, but you still have the same board. 




 By Awakening, he means amazing. 




 I think a case can be made for Dr Who. First, it's an old show. Even the new seasons have that old vibe. I'm not saying it's bad in any way (nor do the millions of fans need my opinion). I'm saying that a modern US show will lool and feel very different. Second, the style of Dr is kinda cartoonish, where US television brings more realistic production. I don't know if it will be better, but it will sure be different.  




 The guy is smooth as teflon! 




 Everybody wants options, but options are not free.  




 So you are talking about global warming. Wouldn't it better to try and fix it instead of moving out? 

Edit: what I'm asking really is how do you know the process is irreversible? Will GM be an issue 100 years out? Who knows.

 I watched the movie with my gf, she fell asleep in the middle. So when it ended I went to bed depressed and sad and I couldn't even talk about it. On the next day she watched the second half of the film, so I joined her because it's just a fantastic movie. I got sad again by the end, somehow I was hoping that maybe I didn't get it right the first time. Damn.  




 But there isn't 'infinite amount of times'. It's a finite number, we just don't know it. Most importantly, we don't know the ratio between that number and the chance of creating life.

 Yeah, but there's no reasom to hide that, people know the story. It's like in the tv series Hannibal. They don't hide the fact (from the viewer) that he's a serial killer, because most people know that.  




 Yeah, maybe. I think it depends a lot on the native format in which the book was published. Usually bettet to leave it at that format than convert it. 




 Also, after you deDRM it, don't convert to pdf, just install calibre on your laptop. PDF is a lousy format for books.

 Cas as tank, Viv supports, IB damage.  




 Biggest mistake was not using voice acting and let it play in the background while the player moves on. With a AAA budget, I doubt that would have add more than a friction to the costs, but would have added a lot to the experience.  




 I'm gonna upvote you, but no way I'm opening that link. 




 Typing: A bit of a 3 way. Thinking: not impressive enough. Adding: Kinda 4 way. 




 It reminds me of a chart that was published a year ago, about winning actors' average age being much higher than actresses' age. Kind of the same issue. However, im both cases it's a matter of public taste, so if anybody's really bored with their life and want to fill it with some shallow meaning, they should direct it to movies watchers and not the Oscars. 




 Yeah, people seem to forget it's about 2 guys, going to work everyday and doing their job. 




 Of course polygamy should be available to any adults who want it. All other technical issues (inheritance, taxes, etc) should be changed to support that. Too bad it's not a popular concept these days. Popular, as in very few people want to form this kind of family, but those who do, suffer greatly from this discrimination.  




 TIL: when some famous dude found out about some stuff he said some clever shit.

Repeat.  




 Well, to be fair, $ spent now is usually more than a $ spent over time. In the current rates environment that's probably another cent off.

Sounds like he's talking about LOTR extended edition marathon and not sex. 




 Which is still better for him than the other night, when everybody called him Rapey McRapesalot. 




 You just made OP hold his head again. 




 ...yet. Tape measure snakes claim hundreds of victims every year.  




 Actually, as funny as those are, most of them do happen at one point or another. It just ends with 'shit, well, I should pay more attention next time' and not 'shit, I should buy something now on TV to stop it'. 




 That's why the first person to try to detach them during fire will get third degree burns in the hands. 




 If they drove in opposite directions, it means that was a head on collision. This is never a small matter and there's usually enough damage to justify an insurance claim. Exchanging insurance details is not being a dick, it's just getting money from **your insurance** to cover the damages **you need to fix**, that's what you pay them for.

Or, maybe it was bumper collision, no damage, and one of them just remember he forgot something at home and had to turn back. 




 you cant even 




 I didn't see even one action tv show that pulls the baby right. It's usually just a prop, appearing and disappearing when it fits the plot. 




 Like Chris Rock puts it: there's a different between being rich and being wealthy. Shaq is rich. The white dude who writes him his paycheck is wealthy.  




 Some people don't want to kill the fish. They just really want it to be late somewhere.       -- Mitch 




 Yes. Also, Hannibal in *the Silence of the Lambs* didn't age very well in my opinion. It looks a bit of a cliche now. Not to his fault. It's more like a [Seinfeld Is Unfunny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny) trope. So starting with the TV series is better.  




 I would say because it isn't funny, but that never was an issue at /r/funny. 




 Are we sure it's for consumption? Can the human body digest grass? [Why Can't We Live On Grass?](http://www.scienceshorts.com/Ssw/060617.htm) [Why Can't Humans Eat Grass?](http://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html). Looks like it's edible but not providing anything to the body. 




 Again? damn, this girl can't hold on to a job. No wonder she has to hack to websites to get hired time and time gain. 




 You know your West Wing stuff, but you forgot something. If you watch that episode again, right after the credits, you'll see: based on true future story. 




 Close, but not exactly. Even if you have a valid visa, or a passport from a country with no visa requirements, you still can be flagged and stopped at the border. Again, without providing any explanation to you. You'll be kept in an airport holding facility until travel arrangements back will be arranged. 




 They take DNA for the same reason they take fingerprints and photo for anyone arrested. They keep it for the record and for future crimes. It's for identity purposes, not for immediate analysis.

 I love it that someone who really knows shit about shit like Musk responds with: "I'm not sure I am [super genius]". 

This is something that those who claim to be smart never understand: the more you learn, and the smarter you become, you also become more humble and realize how little you know compared to others and to what there is to know. 




 Step 1: she doesn't think I want sex  
Step 2: She let me get close to get quickly  
Step 3: "Just to let everybody know, me and Dan aren't dating! I repeat aren't dating! He's my bff and I'll do anything for him, but we aren't dating. 3 you Dan, I wish I could find someone like you"

 Good luck making costumes, and being a nanny, and making home videos... speaking of which... would you direct me in the way to see them? putting it bluntly at least. 









 Thanks, I decided to skip it. The show is coming soon anyway, and if history is any guide, it will be over 3 days after. 




 I totally get it. As an amateur writer, by the time I finish writing a story, even a short one, not only that I don't enjoy reading it, I straight out hate it.  




 It does. That's for another story though. 




 "Find this little trick that makes reposters hate him!" 














 Twist: OP knew it's a movie, but Tumblr just don't like Platoon and think it's an overrated movie and a good excuse to hate America's film industry circa 1985. 









 Thought creates reality crap. I remember a scene, probably from that movie, about a guy who is %100 POSITIVE that if he thinks about a parking spot, he'll always find one when he needs it.

Have you ever dc and wanted to continue your conversation or PM the group, but you didn't know their handles? 

As some of you know, PoE keeps chat logs, among other stuff, in a file called client.txt. I wrote a simple script that reads this file (from the end, because it can be very large), and displays them in 4 separate tabs: global, private, group and trade. 

Notes:

* Download the pastebin file, save as .ahk and run. You'll need AutoHotKey 1.1 and above.
* Default client.txt path is  *C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt* - this can be changed in the script to match your installation settings.
* Default number of characters to read (from the end of the file) is 50000. This can also be changed. bigger number will give more chat messages but longer reading time.
* client.txt should be bigger than that number.

Have fun, and I hope you'll find it useful.  












































 This league I decided to make it more challenging for me and try to be self found only. 

Usually my strategy so far was to pick and use gear up until A3M (group rushing the major bosses in cruel), and get to City of Sarn underleveled and undergeared. At this point I farm currency, adding up to what I already have and get basic gear to carry me through A3M and low level maps (life/es/res).

Alright, so I hit A3M 2 days ago, and I also hit a wall. For the life of me, I couldn't find any decent gear in the past 2 days farming Docks. My resists were around 0%, and obviously you can't survive much like that. 

As much I love this challenge, about an hour ago, I gave up, spent about 8c and got all the gear I need for now.

So after my failed attempt, I really wonder how you do it? how long does it take? did you have any luck so far this league? Do you do it for the challenge or do you just hate trading?

 









 eztv.it was an ideal tv torrent site. Are there any comparable alternatives now that it's down post raid?

The main distinctive feature of the site was that each tv show is listed just once, verified, with different sources to the same torrent. Anything else like that out there? 




 I'm looking for something that will be the hardest to kill up until 75 maps - no Atziri and DPS is less of a priority. Any suggestions? 




 ...Lyrical_ is the first character to enter Palace.

I really don't get how, but it's very impressive. 




 First, a major issue was fixed/set-right: if your default allocation is set to Permanent, and you open a new instance (solo) - the area's allocation will be set to Permanent. Great.

However, I did notice that group's allocation tend to change. We played Graveyard is was PA, went into the cave - it was changed to SA. Same with dock runs. Maybe it's because the leader changed, maybe the first person who entered into the instance. I'm no sure, but I do believe it's happening.

Am I wrong here? 






















































 I noticed the Increase Skill Effect Duration moved a bit, and it's little closer to the Scion now.

 Gallery mode is when media is displayed 100% width/height of the browser windows (or full screen), other text is gone except title. Back/Forward (or space) jumps to the next media. Other keyboard shortcuts can be used to upvote/downvote/hide (and automatically advance), open comments, etc.

There are some external sites that provide that for Reddit, but none is very good and most don't integrate well with Reddit (voting, saving, hiding, etc.), plus they require credentials which is less secure. 

I think it would be a good and useful addition to RES. 









 If you are unfamiliar with Peaky Blinders, it's a British (BBC2) crime series, about a gang family in Birmingham, England post WWI. The cast includes Cillian Murphy in the leading role (Scarecrow from Nolan's Batman), Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) and is joined by Tom Hardy (Inception, Batman's Bane, Locke) in the second season. 

The soundtrack has tracks by:

* Nick Cave (theme song and through out the series)
* The White Stripes and Jack White
* The Raconteurs
* Tom Waits
* Dan Auerbach
* The Dead Weather
* Johnny Cash
* PJ Harvey
* Arctic Monkeys

[Spotify playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/117598253/playlist/3M6R4bKFM4lW0UMG4l6hiy) for a taste.

Great series, worth watching and listening to. 























































































































 If you haven't watched the first series, now is a good chance before second season starts. [Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411511698254/Jamie-Dornan-and-Gillian--014.jpg) in an excellent british/irish crime drama.

The first series is only 5 episodes. And if I'm not mistaken, you can find it on Netflix.
