 Well you are getting it. October.  




 Hodor 




 There was a comment in one of his recent posts on Livejournal about it.

I hope there will be comics for all parts in that series. They are awesome. 




 Fucking and drinking. 




 I hate theories about Jon or Daenerys turning to the dark side. 

I mean, I guess it really would fit George's unexpected twists, but I want my heros I've been rooting for, for 5 years now to fulfill their destinies.

Hoping for Stannis turning instead. Now that would be awesome.

 




 (again) 




 I have a feeling that most people interpret Ice as a ceremonial blade only used for executions which I believe is not the case.

And someone please correct me if you have more facts, but Ice was the sword of the Lord of Winterfell, and has been so for thousands of years (new editions coming along every once in a while).

That means if he was going somewhere where he would bring a weapon. He would bring Ice.
 




 Thank you for that! He was a god. 




 Hopefully people know this. 

Every year from November to Mars, Japanese "fishermen" gather in great numbers trapping hundreds of dolphins in a bay, capturing the beautiful for aquariums and killing the rest for meat. Which are served for example in schools... Watch "The Cove". 

You're in for a cry and your hatred for the human raise will multiply by your animal abuse sensitivity.

And that's just one'of'em.. 




 So, you will basically be the first one to go? :) 




 I hope they cut the Ramsay wedding altogether. They can put the extra screentime on the Wall with the straw men. 




 Nothing important will happen to a viewpoint character off screen. So to speak. That much I am certain of.  




 He would return to ToJ and get back to wooork!  




 I think you need to be an actor to understand it. A lot of them need to be able to imagine stuff about their character to get into the role. That can be harder if you know more concrete stuff. I'm not an actor, but I could imagine.  




 He's probably  the biggest fan of the books in all the cast. If not just the most enthusiastic. Like hearing him rant about it :-)  




 Some people just don't have the imagination to translate words into pictures in their head. That's it.  




 It doesn't show on her performance.. She doesn't know Daenerys character at all..  




 I want a "fetch me a block"  




 Beat me to it. I go for the Swedish versions. Knatte, Fnatte and Tjatte!  




 One thing is certain. Greece do not always pay their debts. 




 The oily black stone the "Seastone Chair" is made of is hinted to be present in Asshai. I take that as people travelled between the two places. Assuming I'm not thick as a castle wall that would make the world round. 




 Isn't it all but confirmed he is not knighted? 
That was how I read the novellas anyway. 




 Come on. Oathkeeper is more Ice than even Ice was. 




 Brienne will fight fAegon confirmed. 




 An armor made of dragonglass. Now, is that something you might be interested in, Jon Snow? 




 *"In 2011 George R. R. Martin, creator of the bestselling A Song of Ice and Fire  Series, approached artist Richard Hescox with the proposition of creating a huge set of illustrations for the upcoming Subterranean Press edition of his novel A Clash of Kings.  Accepting the challenge and diving into what would become a year and a half project, Hescox was privileged to work closely with Martin who had to approve every image before it could be included in the two volume edition, assuring that every character and detail matched his vision."* 




 They ruined her whole storyline and per defintion a part of Tyrion's when they decided to make Shae **love** him. 

It just doesnt make sense, and this is what comes of tampering with the well thought out story. 




 They are going to be released three at a time this way, not counting when he submits new ones for anthologies. 




 Incoming headlines at websites: "George R R Martin releases his new book in October."

And it won't be a lie. 




 Made me laugh, because I know the feeling. 




 Oh yes! Would be awesome if Dany were the one to come and actually clarify it to Jon himself! 




 Dunk   Egg of the Song of Ice and Fire series. Well, it would be epic either way. 




 But, if Jon is light bringer. This theory stands with Ashara being his mother?  




 I'm a fan of this. Would love it.  




 **I have posted it,** and It's based upon Bran's dying wish to be a Knight, his probable highly magical powers and a line from Dunk and Egg 2. Dunk tells the soldier farmers to return to their homes against their Lords will saying: *"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth, not the warrior"* 

With the theory of Hodor being an ancestor to Dunk going hand in hand with this since Bran can Warg Hodor. 
Also, why begin a short story series along with your main story novels if the events weren't tightly linked and important to the whole plot. Oh, and George love Knights. Check his website.  




 Seems people travelled over the sunset sea from the east to Westeros..
The Seastone Chair was their eastmost outpost, like Dragonstone was the Valyria's westernmost castle.

**Could there be any connections between them? Or the people who created them?** 




 He wrote Tywin's speech about legacy so great(it's just not in the show right?), and since he doesn't have kids. ASOIAF is his legacy. I'm pretty sure he's gonna make all he can to finish it. We just have to keep him safe from harm until he has. 

 




 *We'll have to wait and see!* 




 Read the first book in English and you will have enough experience once twow releases.  




 I started when credits rolled after episode 10 season 1. I just had to know what happened to Arya. the Dragons was cool, but I couldn't wait to find out how she would go forth. And I was not dissappointed!

Reaching aFFC, I could order aDwD which just released in time for me.. **that is now 4 years ago...** Feels like last summer.. 




 Not worth. No battles, desync etc. Shogun 2 was the first playable co-op and was still problematic.
Full co-op for empire would have been awesome though. Glad they developed it further.  




 Reading the books would give you an indication. 

Oh and the theory is bollocks.  




 Something like that. Bit we'll have to wait and see! 

And don't forget the bloody lemon trees and the sunny weather..  




 Regrettably true.  









 Clickbait article that doesn't say anything about TWOW that hasn't been said by Anne Groell or Jane Johnson about a month ago... 




 How would everyone feel if Dunk and Egg was turned into a "Sherlock" style mini-series. 1,5 hour episodes, three episodes/season. 3 seasons. 




 Thankfully, by the time I got to read AFFC, A Dance with Dragons had just been released.. So I had that going for me. 

But that's frickin' 4 years ago now.. Shit.. 




 There were a lot more than 7 rubies on Rhaegar's armor. Who do you think he is? Moon Boy? 




 I don't even have the strength to correct your mistakes. But I will anyway, because I'm a good guy.

**Ned brought Ice to battle** at least once that we know of, which is the Greyjoy rebellion. And it is not THAT heavy to wield. It's Valyrian steel which makes it lighter than a regular greatsword of normal steel. 




 Tower of Joy from Ned's perspective. 




 I'm gonna say what I always say. *Next Winter.* 




 A Storm of Swords is easily the best book when it comes to tempo and content. So many twists and cool stuff happening. 




 Absolutely crossed my mind. I really do hope that's the case.
Means a couple of more years for George. 




 Lyanna's fits in so nicely being named queen of love and beauty. 

But sure it could be Ned. Could be Moon boy for all we know.  




 Whoopsie indeed. You must fit Jeyne Westerling into this too. This is known.  




 I think Reed will tell someone that Jon knows, Samuel might find clues about something hidden in Winterfell crypts.  




 Nah, he probably said "Elia Martell". 

*What do you think about my R+LJ impression?*
I think I nailed the unwillingness to understand several clever hints scattered amongst 5 books and 20 years of writing awfully well. 




 I like Rhaenys! Nice and short but yet pureblood Valyrian.

Dragon names are cool! I looked through tWoIaF and Viserion is pretty badass. 




 Yeah well we havn't found the right ones yet. We want'em vaccinated etc. etc. So no rush :) 




 Well duh. I don't know what I was thinking about. Best Call of Duty map of all time btw. 




 I knew it was coming so I have prepared an upvote for ya! 




 *Only a cat of a different coat*
spray water on it's nose everytime I play the song on speakers. Freud + ASOIAF.
Soon it will run to hide everytime it hears it. 




 They all have to be black in that case though. *The seed is strong* 




 Poison one of them, send one of them off to Spain with strangers and keep one for a pet to do as we please. 




 Oh my.. My flair really is true.. This would be hilariously disturbing. 









 R'hollor seems real, in some way. And I guess the Great Other (Hodor) is also real if that is true. Else I don't know. Seems The Old Gods are "only" greenseers, which are a kind of gods in a sense if they are properly trained and integrated in the weirnet :) 




 You best pay'm back, or they gonna fund your enemies 'til they woop your ass and sack your cities for payment. 




 That one is really obvious once you know it's gonna happen. I don't think a lot of people got it before aSoS, but a really good foreshadowing! 




 Well, yeah. It could be Benjen, Brandon, Ser Oswyll Kettleblack or what the hell.. It could be Moonboy for all we know. 

But this added with the other 20 foreshadowings we have for R+L=J *I'm gonna take the liberty to place it in that file for now.* 




 Those approved would be Ned Stark, Lyanna Stark, Rhaegar Targaryen and Howland Reed, right? 




 I am relistening to Clash of Kings, keeping an ear out for good foreshadowing. Some of them are pretty obvious once you know what's going on.

When Jon is about to chop Ygritte's head off George has planted some real obvious foreshadowing for R+L=J 

 nbsp;

*"He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his fathers son. Wasnt he? Wasnt he?"*

**Two times?** That's bold of GRRM I would say. It should stand out, but it really don't if you aren't looking for it.

 nbsp;

There's also one in A Storm of Swords where Sandor Clegane to Arya riding towards The Twins is also has a witty red wedding foreshadowing that is pretty well known


*"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding.*

 nbsp;

**Anyone else know a witty and/or really obvious foreshadowing that has or hasn't struck true yet?** 




 George on the other hand is doing a spectacular job setting it up. Hear that sceptics? 
*Spectacular!* 




 I think we are going to get the novellas and the main series tightly linked together in the future with the help of Bran. 

GRRM began writing about Dunk about the same time as Clash of Kings came out. There is probably some reason for him writing two stories in the same universe parallel to each other yet to be revealed. 




 Was about to say that. Didn't hook me, but it was a good production value.

I'm gonna say go for Rome if you already saw Game of Thrones. 




 They use Aniston as tBBt use Kayle Cuoco. 




 I'd like it if he got decent with his left hand. But we all know where our hopes end up..  (insert witty quote here)  




 I think he was pretty set on Jaime all along.  




 Tinfoil of the day
 




 Nothing important will happen to a viewpoint character off set.  




 Yes,  my thought as well when I read it.  




 I'd say it will all go on North of the neck. Question is where Dany will come from..  




 *We'll have to wait and see!*

But the north remembers..  




 For me it's Arya without a doubt.  




 Absolutely! He doesn't have clue! 




 IF Bran is controlling Coldhands from the future. I must say my own theory of Bran somehow interfering with **Dunk** becomes stronger rooted. My biggest concern was if it was possible to warg something in the past.

Considering Bran has had a year or two practicing on Dunk's supposed great grandson I am now nearly fully convinced.

If you disagree, read my flair. 




 Yes, this was a joy to read indeed! 




 spank you very much. Dotrice made a change in his voice saying that last line that really caught my ear! 




 Yeah, this is George's way of sneaking in stuff. 
Like *"We might even make it to your uncles bloody wedding"*

Were we to interpret characters dialogue as only straight forward we can shut this sub down until tWoW is announced... 




 That would be *pretty strong* evidence for Aegon being a Blackfyre of some sort. Right? 




 Are there any good theories about the **whereabouts** of the two swords? 




 Yeah, saying he was the best is a little far. I'd put Alexander at the top.
Napoleon had the ambition to match Littlefinger! 




 Cookies, cookies, cookies for you. 




 Lyannas crypt is definitely stone. I am betting that is one arm of the prophecies. 




 I agree somewhat. Some actors get typecasted and when that is done, there is not coming back from that. 




 I do not like Sibel in Game of Thrones. May have to do with the character but some lines are just not convincing. Especially season 2-3.
I don't think she's that good looking either so the porn is really uninteresting. 




 Was **Hinds** really Aberforth? It's funny you should mention it because I saw the final movie a week ago, and I paused and thought to myself: *Is that Mance Rayder!?"* I looked it up but found Jim McManus was playing Aberforth. But it sure looks a whole lot like Ciarin Hinds! (Sounds like him too) 




 If it's something other than A time for wolves I'm gonna be mad.  




 By season 2 I knew she were gonna be big. I didn't think it would happen so fast though.  




 Oh god yes. So good. Hinds is great as Caesar!  




 Oh, and Ramsay Snow is good in Misfits. Those first 3 seasons man. Awesome.  




 I was going to say Jerome Flynn should be the lead in his own series. Seems like he already is though! Might have to check that out actually. 




 The Wolf Hall-post got me thinking. Game of Thrones has some of Great Britains most talented actors. Harry Lloyd is one of my favourite Brits, and should have been nominated for supporting role in "The Theory of Everything" if you ask me. I loved him in Doctor Who, a show that has a great many guest actors that stars in A Game of Thrones which I will list below. Tell me if I forgot someone.

 nbsp;

Tobias Menzies and Liam Cunningham are russian submariners.

Joe Dempsie - Gendry

Harry Lloyd - Viserys

David Bradley - Walder Frey is in Doctor Who and also plays William Hartnell (#1 Doctor) in the movie "An Adventure of Space and Time".

Iain Glenn - Jorah the Andal)

Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Jojen

Diana Rigg - Queen of Thorns

Julian Glover - Pycelle

Jamie Sives, Ron Donachie and Ian Hanmore was all in the same episode "Tooth and Claw".

Lucian Msamati - Salladhor Saan

Mark Killeen - Mero

Spencer Wilding - A White Walker who has played aliens several times in Doctor Who

Tim Plester - Black Walder Rivers

Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) was in the spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures

Burn Gorman (Karl Tanner) and Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) was in the spin-off Torchwood

Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin) and Julian Glover was in the old Who-series

 nbsp;

**Rose Leslie** has a role in the season 1 of Downton Abbey where she is great.

Any other show or film where an actor from "Thrones" is particularly *shiny*?
