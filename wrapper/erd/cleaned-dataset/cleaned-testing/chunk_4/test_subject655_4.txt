 Exactly.   

But going to 11 across the board is ridiculous.   

It doesn't mean Racism is over... but at least we can make it so our government doesn't fly racist symbols as their flag.   It makes me sick that everyone else wants to turn this whole thing into a ridiculous joke.    




 So I'm playing this complete waste of a time money stealing game SimCity BuildIt.   I'm at the level where schools became available and the people are asking for them.  But they are 40,000 and I refuse to pay real money to buy fake currency.  So I earn the money by actually playing the game.   

Needless to say, at this level, 40,000 takes a long long time to earn from crafting alone.   If I level up, Police stations will become available and they'll start begging for that AND schools.   But money is tight.  

So I finally earn enough to build the damn school.  And just before I'm about to place it I see a complaint bubble that there are no schools.   Resenting the time I just spent earning this damn school I decided to retaliate.   So I placed it in the low value shitty land in the pollution zone near the factories.  

After I did it I felt vindicated.  Take that, you selfish bastards.   And then I thought.... OH so this is why this lame shit happens IRL.  

Can we PLEASE turn our government inside out these next couple of election cycles?  If not for all you lazy dicks not voting....

Swarm the polls.  Vote out incumbents. (unless they have a verifiable record of not being a corporate hack and/or a dickhead.)  Leave the Bernies in office.  No matter what their party is, if they have a record of staying true to the people, DO NOT VOTE THEM OUT.   Keep them.  Vote out all these other rich knob polishers.      




 As a previously well practiced BMX rider, I'd welcome these.  I might slow down a tiny bit so you can really see how cool it looks.    




 This whole thing is RIDICULOUS anyway.  A mockery is being made out of the issue of taking this flag down from our public buildings.   

Apple just removed games from their store that had the flag in it.  Nevermind if it might be a game about the civil war...............................

Mockery.... a fucking mockery is being made from the issue.   And that's how the issue gets marginalized.  

 




 It's cool.  I just thought the story was a bit out of perspective for the terrible disaster that was Katrina.  

I mean... everything was flooded and we had dead bloated bodies everywhere of people that died of dehydration....in a flood.   

And then there's this story about someone blowing precious life saving water on some fish.   Don't get me wrong... I love my pet fish.  But people are dying out there, John.     




 Oh I'm not talking about peaceful protest.  What a joke protesting.  Protesting is like stamping your feet in a toddlers temper tantrum.  


I'm talking about peaceful polling.  There isn't a lot they can do about 90% voter turnout.   You turn it inside out.     




  What's an assault rifle going to do against a tank?  Nothing.  So instead, it gets used in a different manner that harms innocent people.  Which gives cause for the police to continue increasing arms and owning tanks.  Because we have weapons of war on the street; we need weapons of war to combat it.  It's a goddamn arms race.  And a civilian won't win an arms race.    

The national guard would just get called in anyway.  National guard is full of mouth breathing morons that would just blindly follow orders just like they did in the 1960s.  And many of them are just itching to play big time tough Active Duty Soldier Boy.   I had the unfortunate experience of working with these guys in Iraq.  Fucking morons, with their big time attitudes, thinking they were heroes; and doing stupid shit that got people hurt.    

Any revolution we have needs to be non violent.  Because our stupid little guns won't protect us.  Anyone who thinks guns can protect us from government weaponry is willfully dishonest with themselves about reality. 

And people say "oh the military wouldn't do that".   As a vet... fuck yes we would follow orders.   There would be some desertion as there is in ANY war... but ultimately even the military has an US and Them (civilians) attitude.   

These weapons don't do shit to protect us from tyranny.  Our revolutions need to be peaceful for them to work.    




 Time to argue about rusty nails and tetanus... reddit rules. 




 Front Line Assembly... it was in the late 80s I first heard them.  I was on a road trip to texas.  I was 10 years old.  We stopped at a gas station.  There was a spinning display of cassette tapes in the corner.   I picked up one on the back side that had a cool picture and was dusty.  

I get in the car and popped it into my walkman... it was like NOTHING anyone ever played on the radio.  It was so suspenseful the music.   I was on the edge of the seat waiting to hear what would come next.  And the beats made me want to drum on stuff.   

I was hooked.   I will enjoy everything they make... even if it's not the same now.  I don't care.  Bill Leeb, in yourself and do whatever the fuck you want. 




 My whole family didn't have water for two weeks. 

My uncle died of a heart attack after the national guard just threw the water out the helicopter and it busted open on the ground.   

I'm real glad these fish had water though.  




  Or ~~get into a clinical trial~~ play Russian Roulette...


Fixed for accuracy.  




 Wow I should have sent my size in.   @ 11.5 inches.  

And this is not bragging.    There is nothing cool about having a massive cock and sex is always terrible because the depth capacity of vagina just isn't great enough.  

So, I wish I could, but never will, have the sensation of sinking in "all the way to my balls" that I keep hearing about.  Apparently the feeling is the bee's knees....I wouldn't know.

And blow jobs?   What's that? Blow jobs are so terrible when you are a longer size.  

Underwear?    Boxers or gtfo... and the tip still hangs down.   Anything with "brief" in the name is very uncomfortable.   

And sports suck because even with a J - strap  it gets in the way.  

Most girls are afraid of it, especially when i take it out on the subway.  And when I sit with slacks on, everyone hawks at my massive jiggly bits pant mold. 




 No... those were the 52 inch kickwears.    The Jnco Jean's were still pretty accessible.    

I used to skate vert in those massive kickwears.    I have no clue how I pulled that off but we did it. 




 Congratulations, Kevin Smith.   We need you here with us so I am happy you are getting healthier.

By the way, the perps of this crime [were never indicted](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/).  It's perfectly okay, in GA, to blow up baby faces.  So, this really should become ground zero for continued research into infant facial resiliency.     




 True... but it's those 9 judges that check the power of congress.   

Do you want the judges to be the yes men of a corporate bought congress?  
 




 Look at the supreme court.   

Think about how much influence the next president will have because 2 or 3 judges will need to be replaced under the next administration.   


IT IS SO SERIOUS THAT  EVERYONE REALIZES JUST HOW MUCH THE NEXT PRESIDENT MEANS BEYOND SIMPLE LEGISLATON.   


The Supreme court can be a corporate fuckjob... or it can be built with people that actually resect the rights and power of the people.    

 




 *I wanna know so bad it's making me do the pee pee dance!* 




 He completed 2 out of 3 parts of the ritual voluntarily.  He was interrupted by V'Ger  The new Spock did not do any part of it.  He rebelled from the beginning.  

Edit: It's arguable that there are three basic emotions: Fear, Happiness, and Love. Thus, the three part ritual to remove each set of emotions. The original Spock removed fear and happiness but was left with love.  This love motivated him to do a great many illogical acts for the sake of his crew and love of a dear friend.  

New Spock, having completed zero parts of the ritual, displays his fear, unhappiness, and love quit often.  And as we know, angry/feeling vulcans are basically just Romulans.      




 No no... Now you're trying to back peddle.  Can't even take ownership of your own words.  I'm embarrassed for you.    I refuse to engage in this.  Goodbye.   




 You could drill small holes and put tiny low lvl  UV leds behind it?  




 I'm sorry, your posts are so contradictory from one to the next that you couldn't possibly be the same person.   You went from saying anyone who claimed the USA kicked ass was naive.  Then you flipped and claim that no one is claiming what you just said.  

I have to admit.  I am confused because you can't seem to make up your mind which position to take and refused ownership of your own contribution to the conversation.    




 Nope.  We're done.  **WE DID IT** 




 No even came close to suggesting that.

Except the guy I replied to just did.  Did you read????  Or perhaps you haven't yet figured out how to read the conversation chain on reddit.   Just skip to the end and shitpost.   




 You're lucky that you aren't a slinky. Get well.


[I started thinking about this.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JrM4Cc6)  




 Well you have to consider that Spock in this timeline has not yet purged all emotion in the Kolinahr.   

So he's more violent and disturbed.   He's an angry spock.    




 Look at the Supreme Court.  The next fucking president is so fucking important because of the possible number of judges he/she will get to appoint.  

Everyone better think long and hard who they want with that power.  I'm as serious as a heart attack on sunday evening.  




 Reaches up gently so not to knock it in.... has a been-playing-hockey-all-day-muscle-twitch and accidentally bumps it in.  


Take that hockey gods.     




 I agree.  it's making a mockery of taking down the flag from our public buildings.   




 It's a micromachine commercial!! 




 Look pal, its hot in here... I don't wanna talk. I wanna stand awkwardly or pretend to clean whilst waiting for you to squirt your magic freon juice into those tubes and make this work.  

If the silence gets weird, I'll just bother you with more crazy stories; about how it used to could and now it can't.    




 It always seemd like the more meds I was on the shittier my health got.  

Once I refused pills I got better.  I basically had a choice between having the original condition or having a multitude of other conditions and risks. 

I hope I don't get pancreatic cancer.  I really fucking hope that and 2 meds I was on came with that risk.   

So I'm not really so sure that these "advanced drugs" are really the miracle of capitalism that they are made out to be.   Funny listening to the speed talk side effect speech at the end of drug commercials.  Which happens less and less these days it seems.   But look on the box and HOLY SHIT! Possible side effect "death".  WTF!    I'm gonna have a leaking anus whilst worrying about checking my eyes for yellow every day. Sign me up for monthly subscription to that!

 There is the argument that Germany invaded eastward because it knew the fall of the west was coming. It needed breathing room but ended up being just an extra nail in it's own coffin.  

Yes the USA did just kickass and take names.  Germany was powerful adversary.  They were already there, dug in, with defensive structures in place.   You don't chip away at that sort of situation without being a total badass.  Taking fortified territory is one of the hardest things to accomplish in warfare.   You don't do it by being a pussy... or by being unclever.  Which the USA had to be since it's equipment had to come from half a world away.   We couldn't just load up dozen C17 and C5s and airdrop or insert everything in less than 12 hours like we can today.

The logistical challenges the USA faced far exceeded that of the German army.  The tonnage of cargo and personnel movement world record, from WWII, stood until 2007-2008 when the record was broken at Balad/Anaconda in Iraq.   And it took modern cargo aircraft to accomplish that record breaking.  (armored humvees and MRAPS also weigh a good deal more than a shitty jeep)

So to imply that the USA didn't really do shit in WWII is flatly ignorant.    




 Pretty sure I spent more than a few summers at Camp Failhard.    









 Peaked in highschool.   




 Look at that shit eating grin.  

 




 Fair point.  

Lost Boys just retained a cult following.  His other films, not so much.    




 can one serial kill oneself?  




 I mean I'm okay with the Matrix.  Not because of keanu or anything.  

I generally avoid his movies.  Except I do like Johnny Mnemonic for no good reason at all. I know it's a really shitty movie but for some reason I like it. Nostalgia maybe idk.   

I remember being forced to watch ~~The Notebook~~ edit: I mean the lakehouse or whatever that shit with sandra bullock.  I can't even remember the name lol.  I just remember wondering how many times they were gonna use a turtleneck to cover up his ugly neck.   He is not aging gracefully at all.    




 He knows... he knows ALL about it.   




 No shit sherlock.  Thanks for unloading all that know-it-all on us over a figure of speech.    




 Who you gonna call??  




 Granted: edited.  

Critical thought now:
Did he kill people in The Cable Guy?  




 Let the shitposting roll.  idc.  

edit:downvote this post.   




 Don't worry, buckets can hold tears and brain matter at the same time.

heh heh heheh 

but they have no brains...


Oooooooooooo    




 Edit: He found it. I'm good.   




 People in the media generally dismiss college campus numbers.   




 There was "The Client".

I fell asleep to it.  He made that in 1994.  One of those courtcase movies that never fucking end it seems like.   

And then Phone Booth.... never heard of it.   




 No... because some states will reject corporations money and not ratify.  The political climate in the individual states isn't so easily bought if you are asking for something they are fundamentally against.  It doesn't matter how many billions you have.

Ratification process serves us well here.  Whilst I don't think it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy the entire thing... it's not going to happen quietly.  The massive number of individuals that have to be bought here... it won't stay quiet for long.     

That is a conspiracy of massive proportions that would take mind control to pull off.     




 I don't think your assertion of his "character" can be substantiated in his roles.  He's done so many different things and none of that has really stepped on the toes of his other parts.  

Man on the Moon for better or worse did not feel like I was watching Ace Ventura or the Mask.   

So I think he has the ability to both embrace and transcend his stereotypical image for each of his roles.    




 Still not horror. 




 Well let's be honest. Joel Schumacher has never really lived up to The Lost Boys.  Batman and Robin was terrible.  He hasn't really done anything that memorable.  He's not a bad director, just a tad overrated.   

The director would have to be someone who wouldn't hold back.  But it looks like Jim Carrey won't go that road anymore.  

The story behind 23 seems... weak. 

Edit: I would argue to Carrey that dark psychological ~~drama~~"thriller" =/= pure horror film.    




 That was a comedy.   




 Yeah but their personalities are way different than each other... 

Robin Williams would play a more loathing depressed type of killer that uses the murder to soothe internal pain.  

Carrey would be a more antagonstic or playful killer just out for the sick pleasure.  with some amount of loathing to go along with it.    




 Agree or disagree idc.  

He'd be creepy and dark as fuck....  

Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy.  I mean make it Horror.   

Edit2: Turning off inbox replies.  WTF happened last night?  I barely remember posting this. San Migel Pale Pilson is shit beer.  And I hate Jim Carrey.  I apologize for my behavior in bringing this up.    This is like waking up to discover that last night you were the, so-drunk-it's-awkward-guy, ruining the party.    




 Looks like I picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue.  




 I just finished reading through this series for the 3rd time.  But previous two times was back c 2007 and 08.    

I got to thinking if this could be made into a movie... I don't know.  It'd be a LONG fucking movie I'd think.    

Netflix series??? I'm not sure the intensity of the environment would work over tons of episodes?  If it's TOO campy it won't work I think.   

Disclaimer: Ignore the fact that there isn't an actor alive that would not turn Spider into a clown.     




 I don't know... I've always been resistant to these guys jumping back and forth into each other's storylines.  It takes away some of the uniqueness of the hero within his own world.  

 




 No way... that's TOTALLY a weather balloon.  /s 


Nice pic.  Set as wallpaper and done.   THNX!  




 How fucking childish is that shit.  You know... some of the South Korean people still have family trapped inside. 

"**YES SUFFER HARDER SO THAT YOUR TEARS HAVE A MORE GENUINE FLAVOR WHILE YOU PITIFULLY BEG FOR MERCY!"**

And the usa is all 

"huh hhuh uh here's a stick... poke em with it huh huhuhuh. .  that's cool.  They deserve it. Commies"   

Kim Jung-Un will eventually say please.  But in a long drawn out way before he pushes the launch button.   "Puhleeaasseee"  **CLACK!**  (his launch button has a 3 foot diameter probably)

Europe just thinks if you don't look at it then it will go away.  

China is like a parent that is embarrassed by it's special needs child.    

Russia doesn't give a shit unless it makes the USA look bad then they just play blah blah blah lip service to it....  

Japan is aching to be let out of it's cage.   Until then it just gets to bolster it's "defensive force" and play the victim. (we won't talk about how their short lived conquests are what originally caused all this shit to happen.  NEW FLAG; DIDN'T HAPPEN TEEHEE! )  

The USA just likes to punch shit; so that didn't really heal any of the wounds that Old Japan left behind.   

When shit finally hits the fan with this stupid ass nonsense, everyone is going to wish we had done something different.  Because it's gonna be messy for South Korea and the rest of Asia; as USA and China can't play nice on the water.    




  Someone get the detroit webmaster to put down the crackpipe and reboot the server!     




 Quick! Flip him over and check to see if there's hair on the other end!  




 The first post has the link to the studies bro.   

How many times you gotta be told?   




 Yes... based on the studies... IN GENERAL organics are loaded with parasites when compared to non organics.  

For example,  2 buckets of produce.  Organic and Non Organic.   If the organic has as much as 31% more parasites than the non organic then it was taken on a load of parasites.   LOL    


I stand by that.  

Now please show me where I said 100 percent have parasites?  You can't Because I never said that.  And there are links to the sourced material.... So fuck off.  I'm turning off inbox replies to prevent further feeding of shitposting trolls.  

 




 Please quote me where I said 100% of organic produce has parasites....  

You can't.  Stop shitposting.  Troll. 


Edit:  Yes.... in the first post I link to the comment that has multiple sources already linked.    Did you even fucking read... or check?    




 This is true.  You should wash everything.  

However, the studies were comparing organics to non organics.  Whole Foods is an organic grocery, no? 

It is fair to note, that my opening sentence was "Wash your veggies" but then spoke specifically to the type of organic product of Whole Foods and how you should be MORE vigilant.  Perhaps wash those organic veggies extra due to the increased risk.   

I mean... feel free to simplify an entire post, to a single, out of context quote....

 




 The Moon is a Harsh Mistress talks a bit about this; the problem was people assigned to work on Luna ended up turning into a life sentence if they stayed too long.   




 Holy crap someone asked how these magnets work and got a legitimate answer.    




 Can I borrow your nuclear powered realdoll?    




 Why not?   




 The president is a tax paying citizen like the rest of us though.    
 




 The president is a tax paying citizen like the rest of us.  That means he owns it.   Yes, it is his house.  It's my house too.   

Mi casa su casa.

And we've referred to it as the presidents house for a while.  "The Bush White House"  "The Clinton White House".  

Obama isn't bob dole.  He doesn't need to refer to himself in the third person so he could say "My White House".... But yeah... he lives there.  

You don't own your apartment no matter if it's free or not.  But you still call it "my apartment".    




 Are you like a.... mental ninja?  Or shaman?   My heart feels soothed by this. 




 Fill the middle with thickly mixed acrylic and you have a delicious snack!  


"Did you eat paint cannolis as a kid??"

 




 So wash your veggies.  Organic vegetables are loaded with parasites.  And people catch Listeria from unwashed produced because the pickers and handlers can't figure out how to wash their hands after pooping on them and farmers keep irrigating their fields with water washed down from the pig farms....

As /u/gothic_potato so generously sourced actual studies, [in his post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/3aobr2/a_guy_with_food_poisoning_from_sushi_threw_this/cseu1ee)  

If you're not washing your veggies YOU ARE AN IDIOT THAT DESERVES TO GET SICK.  

ehem.  I'm better now thank you.   

Edit:  On a side note you can ask the cashier to verify the weight on their scale.  But meat departments really should start providing scales to double check. 




 This is true but rabbits also have a hard time drinking liquid water.  They get much of their mosture off the dew covering the grasses they eat.   

So grapes aren't a good thing to feed everyday, They are probably perfect for a lost and probably hungry and dehydrated rabbit.   It's just okay for a first feeding to give it some needed sugars and water.  I would suggest taking the skin off the grapes if the rabbit isn't spitting them out.      

But after some rest you should give it something better suited to it's daily nutritional needs.  
 




 The problem with "buying a law" is that the public is more aware and savvy to these types of events.  And when someone is raking in big money from corporations it's beginning to hurt them more than helping. 

Corporations can buy individual votes... but the ratification process is not so simple as each state's political climate is different.   

That ratification process is what protects the people.   




 Yeah I read your link and spoke specifically on it.  It's 3 almost 4 years old and it was using data collected from the global financial collapse and still during the adjustment period of the recent passage.    

Volume of trading between the two markets isn't even CLOSE to the same.  Neither is how the trading is done.  The GDP of the two countries isn't even remotely similar and neither are the rest of their economic policies or political systems.      

Your USA=Sweden premise is still wrong and unproven.  Try again.  




 Well, fortunately amendments have to be ratified by the states.  So... it's a lot harder for a corporation to buy an amendment than it is to buy a federal law.    




 Because it is a false premise from the very damn start of critical analysis.  If USA = Sweden then we would be located in the exact same location with the exact same system of government with the exact same market laws and regulations.  same leaders population  and same name.   


But since these are obviously not true then yes it is quite incontrovertible that USA and Sweden are NOT the same.   

You said they are contrary to irrefutable fact.  Therefore it is up to You to prove that Sweden and the USA are exactly the same.

And your sources are old as ducks utilizing data from the global recession..... 




 Just throw sheep at the invaders and they'll eventually tire of it and leave.   

 




 No bill of rights??? How do they keep the government from stomping on people's faces?  




 They did that so that we might more carefully consider the treaties we agree to let have power over us.  Giving up control was suppossed to act as a deterrent against shitty treaties.  

That has backfired.  It's time to make amendments to the Constitution to work in today's world.  This isn't 1776 anymore...   




 Upon confronting the victim, one must convince them to sit completely still so that the victim can present a precise location of an area no larger than 1/4 an inch.  The attacker will carefully line up the attack utilizing only their index and middle fingers to jam swiftly, forcefully, and deeply into an area penetrating the area between the  pyramid and the inferior cerebellar peduncle.  


If the victim tenses up and this area cannot be punctured the attacker will then say "Wait" and try again.  If continued flinching persists in disrupting a precise hit the attacker can eventually tell the victim to "hang on 1 sec" whilst they pull out their knife and just access the nerve through the jugular foramen or possibly through the carotid sheath were it lies between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein.  

The attacker must be careful not to nick either of these blood transporting structures, as doing so might cause imminent death; thereby interfering with the process of achieving death by disruption of the bundled pair of vagus nerves.    




 We need an open world WWII game.... 

And these games should feature characters like these to tell their stories.  It would be wicked cool and educational at the same time.   
 




 I thought the standard was: Are the packages they are handling arrive at their destination in a timely manner for a cheap price.  

Fuck yes is the answer to that.  USPS transit times comparable to fedex and UPS slowest cheapest way but yet still costs less money.   

The fact that no one else is delivering leaf mail has absolutely ZERO to do with how well USPS has been performing their job.  I can mail a letter from one coast to the next for less than a buck.  USPS promises it will arrive in 7 to 10 days... it arrives in 3.   

You can't fucking beat that.  So .... shhhh.  you don't know what you're talking about.   

I was in a military unit that broke the global world record for tonnage of cargo and personnel moved in 2008.   That record still stands today.    So I know a little something about logistics.... And the USPS is shit hot when it comes to logistics.    




 Again, did **I** do that to **YOU**??  

A native american man was going around raping people.  Do I blame all native americans for that? 


How about all the crime that Native Americans commit against other Native Americans.... do you hate all native americans right now?  Or is his crime against his own race still really the fault of whites?  

What about the chinese railroad workers that used to murder the native american competition in their sleep?  Do you hate chinese now?   Will you cut one of them if they walk onto a reservation?   What about a mexican?  Mexicans are half white and half native in general.   Would you cut a mexican?  He's half to blame! 


Apparently being full of shit applies to ANY race. 


And I got news for you, the native americans were waring, brutalizing, enslaving, murdering, raping, scalping, raiding, and eating each other LONG LONG before whites ever got here.  I suppose you think they were really all just sitting around in their teepee's smoking peacepipes and playing flutes huh?   They never ever fought or attacked others. *cough PAWNEE cough*   Oh and the Comanche tribe used to hunt down other tribes, kill their babies over a fire and then eat their cooked flesh.   How about a Comanche?  will you cut him?     

You hate all native americans double or triple now?     




 **HE** gave it to **YOU**????? 

This isn't news?? 

Edit: Holy fuck you'd expect this sort of thing happened hundreds of years ago between peoples that are already dead!  But its happening RIGHT NOW!     

I'm sorry, but I don't take blame for the failings of dead people who died hundreds of years before I was born.  My european family line wasn't even in the USA at that time.  (oh and my great grandmother was full cherokee).  Which doesn't mean shit because i'm mostly white.  So much so you can't tell there is any native american genes in my dna.     

So does that mean I get like 75% blame and get to claim 25% victim?  (or whatever the percentage is for that generational spread)

Please.  Use your head and apply some critical thought to the embarrassing shit you think before you just barf it out and look like a fool some more. 




 She has the look of "I just pooped my pants in public." 




 Well I guess I can officially call myself a 2nd Amendment Socialist.   

Thanks. 




 No no... that's not how this works.  That is not my responsibility.  YOU made the comparison.   It's up to YOU to show how they are the same.  This Sweden=USA is your premise not mine.  Why should I care enough to fix something you broke?  Don't slack off, do your own job, and quit asking me to fling myself willingly into your trap.  I won't be suckered into fruitless debates by dogma and false premises.             




 Your making the comparison on the false premise that Sweden's and the USA's economies and markets are the same.  They are not.  




 This....   THIS....  


I owe you a life debt.   My whole life.. and then you... here.  THIS!   BOOM.   

NO MORE WILL I NOT HAVE MY CHIPS OR MY 75 CENTS!!!!!   




 It would hurt... at first.  But all growth comes with pains and investment. 

But you're a fool if you don't invest for the long term.  It's the END GAME that counts.   And in the end, a better educated society that leads the world will be better for the stock market.  

And it really would not hurt that bad.  Do you know how much fucking microtransactions take place in a single second?  This tax would suck for all of 3 months and then it'd just be part of the game.    




 ...which would benefit from a better educated and more pro$perou$ $ociety. 




 TIL: I look and sound like Lewis Black when stuck in traffic.    




 My laughter turned to tears... and not the kind commonly associated with extreme humor.    




 Still needs to ask a vet about it.  Because the cat may have barfed up most of the medicine and there could be more worms further down the intestinal tract.  Vet can advise when the dose again and how much it do additional testing. 




 I'm calling bullshit!  That's clearly a tribble.   




 Explain to me how to walk.    




 I was white in New Orleans inner city school before moving to Atlanta.  

In New Orleans school, there was no separation of students at lunch.  I was a minority and had nicknames like "whitey" "white bread" and "saltine".   I didn't really care because it was in good fun and these were my friends.  Friends that had my back and I had their's.  Which was damn important in New Orleans.  The other whites just sat mixed in with the blacks.  Salt and Pepper.  1 to 5 ratio if I had to guess. 


Then, I moved to Atlanta.  My first day at school, I get lunch and I sit down at the nearest open seat.  I had not yet noticed that all the students were divided.  White kids on one side and the black kids on the other.   

Anyway.  I sat down at what happened to be the blacks table.   Well the black kids started harassing me, pushing me out of my chair, and told me to get back over to the side of the cafeteria; where "my kind" were to sit.   


Now I didn't know what the fuck was going on.   At all.  Goddamn mars this fucking place.  Then I noticed the division.  Having no allies on my first day, naturally I retreat to the white kids' side of the cafeteria; where I had been unanimously told to go, by a large group of very upset students.   And I wasn't accepted there, with the whites, either.  The kids then called me a "wigger" and nicknamed me "white men can't jump" as that movie was popular at the time. White men can't jump was my name for the next 3 years before I moved again.   That was, by far, the dumbest 3 years of my entire existence.  Fuck Atlanta.  Honestly FUCK Atlanta.  

I'm not saying anything at all about this story in relation to the struggle of racism in the USA.  I'm not sure what it means, to be honest.  I'm not going to deny that I would not want the challenges a black man continues to face today.  I do my best not to compound the problems, that other races have, by simply treating them how I would want to be treated.  It's their own fault if they are dicks after that.  And being a dick has nothing to do with skin. 

I've been all over the world and I'll tell you this: People are people and they are generally the same everywhere you go. And one thing that always seems to stay true, no matter where I am in the world, is that a vocal and powerful shitty few fuck everything up for the silent majority.   

 I've never really formed an opinion other than this was an unfortunate situation.   And it taught me to have an open mind... but to also have open eyes to go along with that open mind.    
 




 I'm impotent.  Have sympathy.    




 I agree.   It was something that I saw them talking about on the "news" here in Phillipines... Which is just opinion blabbing just like USA news.   

They were talking about bringing Netflix to the Philippines and discussing how they could possibly make a subscription service work in a poor cash driven society.   The subject of ads came up.   So I asked here wondering what Americans thought.  I suspected it would be against it but I wanted to see if anyone would bring up the "revenue generation" arguments or "incentivizing production of more shows" that was getting thrown around during the segment.     

On a side note: I like how many people are participating and then downvoting the question.   Isn't the vote not supposed to be about agreement or disagreement?   Geeze people, Sorry it's not a *Plumbers of reddit, whats the biggest turd you wrangled at your job* question.
