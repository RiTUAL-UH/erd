 It's been a while since I read the book, is Jon established as definitely having died? I remember him being mob-stabbed but I can't remember at what point the narrative cuts off. 




 I expect there to be some more hints about Jon's true parentage! 




 As long as you have decency and gumption you're a-ok! 




 I've encountered a lot of scholars of religions in my philosophy seminars and they were bright and interesting people to a man (and woman, of course). Anyone who can wrestle with Thomas Aquinas and come out the other side in one piece deserves a great amount of respect in my mind. 

I worked as a bartender and bouncer through my undergrad, not quite the same as a barista, I know, but similar in some ways... just with more drunk people. 

Once you have your masters, depending on whether your church offers this opportunity - why not go and travel to the farthest reaches of your faith's influence and work in a congregation there? I knew a young catholic priest once who worked in McMurdo station in Antarctica for a year. I always envied him because of this.  




  I haven't really felt anything for anyone since we broke up, not even sympathy or emphathy. Just..kind of...a heart of stone.

I've experienced that a couple of times. It sucks. I would tell you that it will pass but I know from experience how unhelpful such comments feel - when you're in a bad spot you don't want your experience to be downplayed as a 'passing phase', no matter whether it's true. What I will say is that, in time, this episode will help you understand things about yourself you didn't previously. 

Relationships ending is tough, especially if it's the first serious one but it will help you figure out some stuff. It's a learning experience, as cruel as that may sound right now.

As for the college stuff - don't be so quick to dismiss the skills you've learned with your degree - most of what you've done in the last 4 (I'm guessing) years can be marketed as skills, if you know how. I have a degree in liberal arts and there were times I was freaking out about my future prospects. I run a production company now, it's doing very well. And as ludicrous as it may sound, the skills I learned in getting my degrees in creative writing and comparative lit. are paying huge dividends. Like, six-figure dividends.

Figure out your passions (another throwaway encouragement prompting a lot of eye-rolling) and then figure out how to link them to your degree and then figure out how to make a career out of that. It's easier than you might think.

Good luck with everything, /u/Gordo-Mofo. You'll land on your feet!

 




 Sure thing. I've edited the comment! 




 What always flummoxes me is how people don't seem to understand that beauty is mostly an arbitrary concept, hugely influenced by societal mechanisms.

Different regions and different times have/had different ideals of beauty, most of which are based on scarcity:

You live in a society where most people have office jobs and don't have time to be outside? A nice tan is attractive. Live in a society where the majority works outside everyday? A pale complexion is attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is scarce? Heavy people are attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is plenty and cheap? Thinness is attractive. 

Knowing all this, most of us still seem unable or unwilling to accept that our notions of beauty are just that - notions, moving targets, influenced by what everyone arounds us finds attractive. Not only do we seem unable to accept this, many of us turn the concept up to eleven - proclaiming that beauty (a fleeting attribute at best) is the only thing to be valued in a partner, while the content of someone's character (more enduring and, I'd argue, ultimately the most important thing if you want to be with them) is being relegated to "oh also, they're nice I guess". Crazy, when you think about it.

Thing is, I would never want for someone to have to change what they find attractive, it's everybody's prerogative to like what they like, but these subs are designed to target people those users find unattractive *because they're not attracted to them*! Why would anyone expend the energy to hate something/someone they're not affected by? It's sort of the same thing as with straight people who fight gay rights: "Oh, you're not attracted to members of your own gender? **The don't date them!** Why do you care what they do?

And it's in following that question that the anger I feel over what's happening in those subs mixes with pity. Because the answer to that question is. "You don't care. And if you do there's probably something wrong with you." 

Ever so often when a post from fatpeoplehate or ImGoingToHellForThis or some equivalent subreddit hits a top spot in all I go and have a look at the discussion, find a user spewing particularly rabid hate and check out their post history. Know what I find? Lots and lots of self-hatred. I think fatpeoplehate especially is mostly made up of (often shockingly young) kids who either are heavy and browse the sub hoping that the self-hatred it inspires will help them lose weight, or kids who were heavy and can't reconcile that part of their past with their ideology in any other way but by ridiculing others (as avatars of themselves, you see this happen a lot with ex smokers too). 

A few times I stumbled upon kids who also posted in thinspo subs (communities that encourage each other in their anorexic disorders). One of those kids confessed in such a sub that she used fatpeoplehate as a way to prolong the time until she finally had to cave and eat something... I'm sure if you pulled more of these threads you'd find even worse stuff... I think we can agree that hating someone for something which doesn't affect you is not really the behaviour of a happy and healthy mind. Sad. 

Sorry this turned into a novel, I guess it was just something I had been thinking about for quite some time...  

 




 I agree with everything you're saying, these subs make me incredibly sad!

That being said, I find your description of of that thread's OP as having a "tiny flat stick body" problematic as well. I understand the temptation of responding to an insult in kind but thin-shaming is a weak defense against fat-shaming.  




 If you have a beard your mileage may vary on that one.  




 Except gay people can have healthy, fulfilling relationships as consenting adults. 




 Thank you for this comment!

I've been lurking in this sub for the past few days and your comment was the most helpful I've seen so far! Like OP I've wasted weight on unnecessary junk (which prompted the use of more boosters, which led to a spiral of clutter). I just tested a more minimalist design with great success. Thank you! 




 I wouldn't care if the showrunners had no idea how the books end, but they do.

I heard about that but I wonder whether that means that they will end the show in that way... I guess time will tell. 




 That's a bit misleading. While there is no 'cure' for pedophilia, there are therapeutic programs that can help people deal with their sexual impulses through cognitive-behavioral training and by counselling them on how to act in high-risk environments. 

The suppression of the sexual drive through medication (i.e. chemical castration) is one approach of dealing with the issue but it's far from the only one.
