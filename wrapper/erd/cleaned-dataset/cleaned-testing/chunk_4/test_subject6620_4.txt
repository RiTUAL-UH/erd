 Saw that driving on the Edens on my way home from work. Ruined my day. 




 I watched this last week. It will give you a snapshot of what gang life was like at Cabrini Green; however, the Venkatesh book will go more in depth about how massive housing projects like the Robert Taylor Homes bred a community ruled by gangs.  




 No way. Is that the sequel to Snowicane?  









 Yep. It's funny because there are like 4 people that live in Rosemont. But everyone has been to a concert/convention there at some point. 




 I also graduated from Leyden in 2006. Funny how so many Franklin Parkers are like phantoms. Most reactions to "I grew up by Grand and Mannheim" are followed by " where the hell is that?" 




 ...and precipitation levels are rising, Chicagoland... In my pants at least 




 Leave Tom alone, that was meteorological research for your information. 




 Make a short trip west on North Ave. Al-Mart has some quality mattresses and beds. Just got my second one from them. The first one I had was so solidly built that I needed a hacksaw to get it out of the bedroom.

Also, ask about free delivery; if you're in Humbolt Park you'll probably get it. 




 Thank you for clarifying, sausage king.  




 But is it *actually* Q101? ...Not yet at least 




 These pictures are actually pretty funny. All the players look exhausted. Kruger just looks confused (much like everyone else who heard he was on team Sweden). And at one point, Oduya and Hossa must have said. "That's  it we're done wearing shoes!"

That aside, this is going to be the highest caliber hockey since 2010; let's just hope our 10 hawks play well and don't get hurt.   




 Is that a [Bob?](http://www.reactionsport.com/ma-equipment/ma-equipment/century-bob-body-opponent-bag/) 




 Crawford for Prime Minister! 




 Patrick Elwood and his sassy head bobbin' 




 The valley of ashes, I recall. Or maybe it was "that smoky shit-hole"...it's been a while since 10th Grade literature. 




 Eh. Some time in the past 3-4 years Tom has lost his damn mind. I'm pretty sure he's still on WGN just so that someone can legitimately say  "monsoonal backwash" on network television. 




 Gary is such a sad story. There were 180,000 people in Gary 50 years ago. Now there might be 75,000. About 50% of their kids are graduating from high school. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate. 




 no argument about that. so I'll just be a good Cubs fan, roll over and cry about how a Sox fan was mean to me again. 




 True. I'm ripping on Sox fans for their historically poor attendance. 




 This crow is just getting ready to tell a story about how he literally watched all of his friends and family drop dead of the West Nile Virus. "It was the summer of 2004..." 




 Pure Michigan?  




 This picture definitively clears up a curiosity of mine. Guess I can free up some space and clear those dead beavers out of my freezer.  




 This is assuming that the ballpark would be prepared for more than 20,000 people to show up. 




 Whoa, Hjalmarsson has a headless kid! 




 If you really love Hemingway you'll enjoy the place. I do remember going here on a field trip though. Some girl passed out because it was 95 degrees  in there. My teacher hated Hemingway, and later apologized for the trip being a part of the curriculum. There was a guy who was about 100 giving the tour, and I think his name was Jim Christmas. He was pretty hilarious.

For what it's worth, visit the Hemingway foundation across the street. There are some cool samples of his writing from way back, including a description of a football game that he wrote in 9th Grade at OPRF. Hemingway got an F on it. 




 Wait, how can people take a tour of "murder castle" if the building was destroyed long ago? I'm almost certain that the post office in Englewood occupies it's space today. 









 It's clearly a hybrid. Why don't you educate yourself and start caring for our planet? 




 This, plus impaired judgments can be reasonably assumed after 12 a.m. 









 Geez, Food 4 Less! I know that the Chicago ban on handguns has been deemed unconstitutional, but that: BUY TWO HAMS GET A GUN! promotion is just a little over the top 




 It is a legit lead now. 




 Weak PK call; Liverpool not deserving the lead right now. 
 




 That was my first championship. Had LT and Chad Johnson, when he was simply referred to as Chad Johnson.  




 Ha. I'm in DC and moving back to Chicago in a week. That is supposed to be a really good place to watch a game. Hockey News wrote a few years back that there really aren't bad seats there. Just make the trip, man I never made it up there while I lived out east, but it should be worth it.  




 I would probably start Syphilis in an STD league. 




 Lynch,
Andre,
Lacy (it's only Tuesday; keep monitoring, but the Cowboys D is swiss cheese) 




 [Let Tony Esposito tell you some more about it..](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFhNGyhY4m4) 




 Troy Murray just said "these boys are gonna compete like the dickens in the third period." ...Let's hope 




 I was taking my students back from a field trip when all of this was happening. It was pretty disturbing for the community to hear about a gunman's presence, and disorienting for the students who were blocked off from moving west down East Capitol. 









 That is surprising. When he was in town playing for the Wolves a few years ago he was kind of a waste of roster space. He made no contributions offensively or defensively and lost every fight. 

But here's to hoping he has a run-in with Bollig today. 




 Incentive? 

Yes, this could work. As long as it is structured and serves a purpose. 20 minutes per week of reading current news stories and listening to music is a way I reward students if they meet the expectation. (All assignments attempted, no behavior referrals, no excessive tardies, etc.) 

Also hype up your incentives. Once a month, I'll raffle a Chipotle/Subway gift card to a student who has no missing assignments, no behavior referrals, and less than two tardies.

 Too bad they closed the K-Mart in Franklin Park. That place was hoarder central 




 I've been away from Chicago for more than a year now, but that Victory Auto Wreckers Commercial was still playing on WCIU, Channel 26 in 2011. 




 The last time pro hockey was played in Indy was actually 2004. The Indianapolis Ice played there in the old IHL, and later the CHL. [This was their logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indy_Ice.png) although I would picture it more appropriately on a 99 cent bottle of water. 




 At least I can say that I have owned a Pontiac. He doesn't have one. 




 Thanks! An insane British guy definitely makes this thread a bit more interesting. 




 Yeah. Although he is playing against Revis, the guy is top 5 in receiving yards and is a home-run threat if your league rewards for longer touchdowns.  




 If your playing a team with a losing record... How about "MRSA Killing?" 




 Should be a good one. Stay healthy everyone!!

 Do they at least have hashmarks on the streets to signify where the cameras are? I'm in DC now, and every speed camera is completely conspicuous.  




 [Yep. That's definitely Sodom.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Smoke_Over_Vancouver.jpg) 




 Unless living in the "meth belt" appeals to you. 




 [An important point in Illinois history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War). Nothing shameful about naming your team after a strong organizational leader not content to just allow new settlers to stake a claim to the land that was once home. 




 Inspiration by Gogurt. 




 I know that I'm not in the right country, but Borat is the only person I can picture behind the wheel. 




 Please show this gentleman the door.  




 I think the rivalry should get hyped with the Jets too. You've got 3 ex-hawks (Frolik, Ladd,   Byfuglien) + playing in Toews's hometown. Should be a recipe for some exciting hockey.
