 SINCE A COUPLE OF DAYS I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING MY FUCKING BEST IN LIFE. EACH NIGHT WHEN I SLEEP THERE IS A VACUUM INSIDE MY DISSATISFIED HEART SOMEWHERE. IT GIVES ME THE FEELING OF VAGUE REGRET. IT'S A WARNING SIGN THAT SAYS THERE IS SOMETHING FUCKING WRONG WITH HOW I'M INVESTING TIME IN LIFE.

I KNOW I WILL BOUNCE BACK. BUT I DON'T FUCKING LIKE TO KEEP BOUNCING BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD FEELINGS SO GODDAMN FREQUENTLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THE PRICE OF A STOCK ON THE SHAREMARKET.. I WANT TO BE FUCKING CONSISTENT IN MY PLANS AND LIVING. 

CONSISTENCY IS FUCKING NECESSARY TO ME FOR WHAT I TOOK UP TO ACHIEVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M FUCKING TIRED OF TRYING TO BOUNCE BACK EVERY TIME I FEEL LIKE THIS.

THIS QUOTE IS APT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME RIGHT NOW:

**"IF YOU'RE TIRED OF STARTING OVER, STOP GIVING UP."**  




 trending on the front page of Reddit.. that's what you're doing with your life... Pretty awesome if you ask me! 




 No. Harry is the only survivor on whom the killing curse is *performed*.. so technically Voldemort can't be called as a survivor as he wasn't *performed* the curse upon, and moreover he wasn't a survivor at all... He disappeared at that moment.. and was almost dead... so no he did not survive.. he yielded to its effect. 









 Oh my god.. such a great advice... thank you so much! 




 when something cool like this quote comes up, the nonsense and the so called "funny" comments really ruin the fun out of it....  




 this pic is visually very fascinating.. 




 MEDIOCRITY IS THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING WORD I FACED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE THAT HAS PUT ME WHERE I AM TODAY. BUT I SEE THE SILVER LINING IN ALL OF IT. THANK YOU, MEDIOCRITY. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 














 GREETINGS FROM INDIA.. ALL THE VERY DAMN BEST FOR THE GREAT AWESOMENESS AHEAD, BROTHER! 

NAMASTE :) 




 THIS YEAR I TOOK UP THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY LIFE. SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH HIGHER EDUCATION.. A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM AT WHICH I WANT TO DO VERY WELL, LIKE REALLY VERY WELL, LIKE FUCKING AWESOMELY WELL... 

I AM TRYING TO STRICTLY WORK TOWARDS IT. TODAY I TRIED TO STRATEGISE MY PREPERATION FOR THIS MONTH. (AND ALSO I HAVE A DAY JOB SO I GOT TO MAKE TIME TO STUDY EVERYDAY AFTER THE WORKING HOURS..) IT'S 2AM IN MY COUNTRY'S TIMEZONE NOW. I'VE BEEN STUDYING ALL ALONG SINCE 10.30PM. AND I'M GOING TO STUDY SOME MORE NOW.. THIS EXAM IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.. (I NEED TO STICK TO THIS TYPE OF HARD WORK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND MORE.. LET'S SEE!) 



 




 Thanks for the translated post. It's amazing.. What is the title of the book in English? 




 YEAH.. HOW WE USE OUR TIME CAN BE A REAL BIG DEAL IN LIFE. BY THE WAY, IF YOU CAN, COME AROUND SOMEDAY AND SHARE SOME OF THE COOL SHIT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE.. WOULD SURELY HELP OTHERS IN GETTING IDEAS! 

GOOD LUCK 




 YES I DID... BUT TIME AND AGAIN COMING BACK HERE TO HELP OTHERS BY TELLING WHAT GOOD STUFF YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE WOULD BE OF A KICK FOR ALL. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WASTE TIME ON THE INTERNET, BUT JUST ASKING TO KEEP THIS MOTIVATING SUB OF OURS ALIVE.. IF YOU THINK THAT IS A TIME WASTE, THEN YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN REAL LIFE WITHOUT WASTING TIME ON THE INTERNET. 

NO HARD FEELINGS, BROTHER!

ALL THE GODDAMN BEST FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN YOUR LIFE :) 




 I did not understand this quote! 




 AWESOME FEAT BROTHER. LET ME TELL YOU.. YOU DID GREAT, MOTIVATING THE FUCK OUT OF YOURSELF BUT WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THE 4TH DAY. WHEN YOU STEPPED OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD AND STARTED TO BACKFLIP WITHOUT THAT SOFT BED TO BACK YOU, I REMEMBERED THE DIALOGUE FROM *THE DARK KNIGHT RISES* : **"DO IT LIKE THE CHILD DID. WITHOUT THE ROPE"**

AND YOU DID IT, LIKE BATMAN.

CHEERS, BROTHER! 




 LIKE I FUCKING MENTIONED ALREADY IN THE TITLE THIS SUB IS A REAL GODDAMN NERVE TREMBLING GROUND. THE WORLD OUT THERE THINKS WE ARE LOSERS. WITH ALL THE MIGHT IN OUR MINDS WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT ANY BIT TRUE. BUT THIS SUB SEEMS LIKE IT IS PERFORMING VERY MEDIOCRE. NO POSTS FOR DAYS AT A STRETCH. I FUCKING DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT IS SO. 

**ARE WE FUCKING AFRAID TO SHARE WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING IN OUR GODDAMN LIVES?**

**ARE WE FUCKING SHY TO RISE FROM THE AHSES AND BE THE PHOENIXES THAT WE ARE?**

WHAT THE HELL IS STOPPING US FROM COMING AND CONNECTING WITH THE LOVELY BROTHERHOOD AND SHARE SOME FUCKING MOTIVATION?

OK... ENOUGH RANT.. NOW, BORROWING THE WORDS FROM GANDHI, I WOULD RATHER BE THE CHANGE I WANT TO SEE IN THE GODDAMN WORLD AROUND ME. SO I'M GOING TO MAKE POSTS HERE REGULARLY. 

I DON'T KNOW IF ANY BUTTHOLE OUT THERE IS LISTENING TO THIS BUT I REALLY WANT US TO BE GODDAMN WINNERS IN OUR CHOSEN ASPECTS OF LIFE, WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY MAY BE. AND I DON'T WANT THIS SUB TO BE A STAGNANT FUCKING POND, RATHER I WANT IT TO BE THE BLOOD IN OUR BODIES, ALWAYS FLOWING AND KEEPING US FUCKING ALIVE.

**ALIVE, MOTHERFUCKERS. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE ON THE INTERNET?**

THEN FUCKING PROVE IT!

 




 SOMETIMES IN LIFE FOR THE FUCK'S SAKE YOU GOT TO DO THE THINGS SOLELY FOR YOURSELF. YOU GOT TO FEED YOUR FUCKING SOUL WITH SOMETHING EXTREMELY DELICIOUS, WITH SOMETHING THAT IT CRAVES FOR SEVERELY. IF YOU EVER GO THROUGH SUCH A TIME, DO REMEMBER TO STOP THE FUCK AND REFLECT ON THAT JEWEL OF A MOMENT, BECAUSE IT HOLDS THE MOTHERFUCKING KEY TO THE MOTHERFUCKING DOOR WHICH OPENS UP TO SOMETHING THAT IS BUILT PURELY FOR YOU ALONE IN THIS ENTIRE UNIVERSE. I MEAN, ASK YOURSELF HOW FUCKING SAD WOULD IT BE TO GODDAMN MISS SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT! 




 That's a nice idea... but I'm so keenly attached towards the actual last name, *Dumbledore.*

He is an epitome of all the things from the Harry Potter series that defined my life.
 




 YES. A GODDAMN YES FOR THIS POST. 
WE ARE ALL GONNA MOTIVATE THE FUCK OUT OF EACHOTHER. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. LET'S JUST FUCKING ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES ONCE AND FOR ALL. 

*AIMING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS SEEMINGLY UNATTAINABLE AND YET CONFIDENTLY WORKING TO ACHIEVE IT WITH ALL THE PASSION AND MIGHT HIDDEN INSIDE THE NERVES OF YOUR INSANELY BEAUTIFUL MIND IS WHAT I CALL THE FUCKING PURPOSE OF A GODDAMN HUMAN LIFE.* **SO LET'S DO THIS!** 




  I'm starting to think that real life is my pseudonym

That sounds like a very well put opening sentence right there, pal :) 




 Oh.. that's a big bad news for me :-(

Let's say I want to use *Dumbledore* as my surname.. Then what? Should I be asking J.K. Rowling for permission?? (*I wish the answer is 'No'*) 




 And also let me please ask you one more doubt of mine regarding pennames:

 *Is it ok to adopt a part of my favourite fictional character's name into my penname? Or should I be approved by character's creator (author) for doing that?* 




 Is this a digital image?? Which software was it created it?? I just would like to recommend it to my animator/3D modeler friend. 




 I logged in to upvote this post. 




 Ok.. Sounds cool and legit. Thanks :) 




 Yeah.. That really makes sense. Thanks. 




  one reason is to restart a career

Thanks for the information.. Didn't knew this before.  




 The idea of your book is really interesting to me... Especailly the prot realizing that he doesn't know anything.. Greetings for coming up with something like that .. And all the very best for it get good publishers.. and when it happens do plz message me a link where I can buy it.. Amazon probably.. I'm from India. I would like to read your book, pal, assuming that it's not very very long ;-) 

Thanks :) 




 Great idea.. and it's most of the times true in my case as well. Music has myriad times influenced my mood to write.. It moved me so much that I once immediately started to write a poetic piece, which I felt as my best work yet. (It's a heartfelt message to my girlfriend while I was in college.)

Most of the times it is film sound tracks.. Hans Zimmer, especially.. I'm from India, so I would like to more names to it: A.R.Rahman, Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Amit Trivedi etc.. These people's music had influenced my thought process many times and pushed me towards writing something refreshing, which I didn't have in mind moment prior to listening to their music..

However, I don't everytime get influenced by music alone in order to put my thoughts to words. No body should, because it will make you feel dependant on it. That's not how creativity shold work always. 




 What if I want to write books with another name but tell out that it's actually me? Is that against the accepted norms in the Writing arena?

Just asking. 




  The same thing happened when I read "The old man and the sea" :/

Greetings, pal. I too felt *The Old Man* by Hemingway to be so boring. Thank God it was very small, so I was able to finish it off, just for the heck of it.. 

 




 Yeah.. I'm into Part II of the book and got really put off all along.... 




 Thanks for the precaution.. shall never touch it. 




 Thanks... but I don't like Hunger Games either.... I hated the concept shown in the film... 




 Let me ask: what kind of an idiot helps a person who he met only days ago, and assists him in killing a person, or rather commit the murder himself?? I mean, there was nothing where he questions Raymond what is the real matter behind all those Arabs following him and why is he carrying a revolver. He always agrees for whatever Raymond asks for, not just about partying out, but also in hurting and killing somebody. What is existentialism? Is it straight ahead killing somebody whom you think is trying to harm you? Why did nobody, neither the protagonist nor Raymond, ever tried to speak it out with the Arabs before using the weapon, guys?? What kind of *ism* is that?? 




 I just realized from comments here that the book is about *nothingness* in particular - and unfortunately I don't like nothingness - the only nothingness I ever liked is the vacuum in the cosmos. 




  not a bug, a feature.

I like the way you put it :) 




 I'm 24 and not at all in high school right now.. and also am from India. 




 Right now I'm thinking to stop reading *The Stranger* by Albert Camus...
 




 I have been trying to read one book per week this year.. so this week i picked up *The Stranger* by Albert Camus, looking at its classic status, and also because it is a small book (I like small books). I've enterted into the Part II of the book just now, and all along Part I the book seemed to be having no soul or story - it just went on and on randomly to here and there - with characters that came up having no good depth.. and also the narration is pretty dull. I guess this is the book in a long time that I read half without finding a single quote to highlight.  




 never heard of it... will surely check it out.. thank you so much..  




 I DECIDED TO WORK LIKE HELL FOR THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY LIFE, A CHALLENGE THAT I TOOK UP AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, BUT I HAD BEEN AN ASSHOLE (ALTHOUGH NOT COMPLETELY, BROTHERS) AND DIDN'T PUT GOOD POTENTIAL INTO IT YET. THIS ENRAGED ME.. BUT NEVERTHELESS IN THIS MONTH I LOOKED AT THE PITFALLS IN MY PATH. AND LET ME CONFIDENTALY TELL YOU ALL BUTTHEADS THIS: *I AM NOW BETTER SHEILDED AGAINST THOSE PITFALLS, GODDAMNIT. I WILL FUCKING USE THEM AGAINST THE STORM AND WILL SWIM FORWARD, UPSTREAM. I WILL WORK LIKE FUCK I'VE NEVER SEEN IN MYSELF BEFORE. I WILL FUCKING SURPRISE MYSELF WITH MY POTENTIAL* 

AND LET ME ALSO TELL YOU THIS, MOTHERFUCKERS -  I LIKE THIS SUB VERY GODDAMN MUCH - BUT AT TIMES IT IS VERY PUTTING OFF TO COME HERE AND FINDING OUT THAT THE MOST RECENT POST WAS DAYS FUCKING OLD.. 

**OLD WON'T DO, LET'S ALL BE NEW..**

**EVERY FUCKIN DAY, IN EVERY FUCKIN WAY..**

*[THAT'S FROM THE POET IN ME, WHICH IS WHY THE HELL IT EVEN RHYMED.. ]* 




 YES. THOSE ARE SOME REALLY GODDAMN GOOD WORDS. THANKS, FRIEND! 




 I'll just be candid. I'm trying to develop an idea that I felt interested in for writing my first novel. I can say that the idea I'm taking up deals with the existence of parallel universes.. Can somebody please suggest me some good books that will help me know about Parallel Worlds and Universes?? 

Fiction or Non-Fiction, or even poetry, whatever works you think would be helpful for me, please suggest them.

Thank you all so much :) 




 This AMA has some really good questions and answers for artists, and people looking towards passions and dreams... That itself made me click the Save button and upvote this post. 




 Thanks for giving me a new goal in life.... I will collect all those books for myself.. and yeah by the way, I'm gonna share this pic on my Hogwarts group on Facebook. I shall link this URL there in order to credit you. Thank you so much, pal :D 




 I can not just pass by any *Thoreau* related posts without upvoting/commenting it..  




 meh.. 




 Yes.. possibly.... 




 did not understand... it sounded gramatically wrong as well... 




 awesome pal... very motivating one! 




 Hey, OP, plz tell - is this quote from a book or something??  What's the source?? 




 no doubt.. 




 Oh it is.... especially the last five words 

 we travel between the eternities. 




 Source plz... the writer of this quote deserves it... 




 Yeah.. why not.. Positive thinking/attitude has proven multiple times that it can make great changes in the world.. and in people's lives.. Although telekinesis would directly mean moving things physically, optimistic mindset also appears to do the same with the situations of life - it physically changes the circumstances of a person's life and makes him get what he desired. For example, **placebo effect**- the way people think and perceive a situation literally makes changes in the same. 









 I will never give out spoilers for anything.. I hate ruining any kind of experiences of people.. That being said, I felt The Giver as just ok because I don't enjoy dystopian novels very much.. They just feel very depressing. I'm not good with the books that give out such feeling.. I even disliked *1984* by George Orwell especially for this reason, while I loved his *Animal Farm*.

Talking particularly about *The Giver* the narration seemed a bit different and most of the times very straight not bothering about exploring the feelings of characters in depth, although it helped in keeping the book short, which I like. 

So, you might completely enjoy the book if you're fine with dystopian concepts - it's a good book for those who enjoy such setting. 

 




 Very cogently put! 




  Finished Book #1 yesterday and just finished this book (#2) today.

I always wonder why people here remind me again and again that I read so fuckin' slowly :(== 




 Steve Jobs book is awesome.... and hey thanks for reminding me to read *Business Adventures* 




 It felt just ok for me... 




   i suspect it will consume the next 1-2 weeks of my life atleast,

800 plus pages and you finish it in just a couple of weeks?? amazing!!

TIL again that I read dead slow.. Thanks for reminding me that! 




 **Zen Mind Beginner's Mind, by Shunryu Suzuki** - an introduciton and a peep into the practices of Zen Buddhism.

Finished reading:

* **Steppenwolf, by Herman Hesse** - an intriguing story of a lone person who comes to experience mulitple facets of his life by meeting a few persons in a new city that he moved into.

* **Carrie, by Stephen King**  - the debut novel of the outstanding author.. nuff said. 




 Your art work is very very awe-inspiring... You will reach great heights in life :-)

Thank you so much for sharing it here... 




 Hey really thanks man for those words....!!! 




 Helpful.. Thanks... The book is really tricky ;-) 




 This is really awesome.... Thanks :-) 




  HE KNOW WHO HE IS.

HE FUCKIN KNOWS WHO HE IS - 'KNOWS' - NOT 'KNOW' - USE THE GODDAMN GRAMMAR FUCKIN CORRECTLY YOU GOOD FRIEND OF A BIRTHDAY BOY.  




 Your response is helpful.. Thanks :-) 




 Bodh Gaya, India - said to be the place where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment! 




 I'm reading Shunryu Suzuki's *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.* In Part 2 of the book I encountered this paragraph:

*Practice should be directed from achievement to non-achievement. Usually when you do something, you want to achieve something, you attach to some result. From achievement to non-achievement means to be rid of the unneccesary and bad results of effort. If you do something in the spirit of non-achivement, there is a good quality in it. So just to do something without any particular effort is enough.*

But, let's say I'm preparing for a National level entrance exam that would put me into a great college for higher education. So, I will surely be attached towards a result - to get into the top college in the country. But that paragraph speaks against it.

Am I looking at it the wrong way? What would be the actual interpretation of that paragraph in this scenario?
 




 Thanks a lot, pal, for giving the source.... 




 How enriching...!! 




 Nailed it. 




 Nice language usage.. and good point too... 




 I often wonder how much time people waste by talking shit in Reddit comments.. and how much more by reading them. Would be good if somebody comes up with such an analytical post on r/InternetIsBeautiful or somewhere!! 




 It's often surprising how, while great minds like Newton, Einstein and etc., that discovered the science of the universe as we know it, are naturally humble to the inexplicable mysteries of the world around them, some of our so called *modern scientists* all boast up as if science can explain anything and everything, as if nothing in this world is a wonder or a miracle, as if everything can be put to scientific explanation. 




 THIS.IS.SOME.KICK-ASS.STUFF. 




 What you said is seems true... I just saw a comment here for my post from a person and he really misinterpreted it. 




  Translation: It doesn't matter which way you go, if you don't have a direction in mind

I'm sorry to put it like this but I'm 100% positive that this is not it.. Your translation speaks of negativity of mind and thought.. But the point in the book where the paragraph came up is not in least bit relevant to what you said. Anyways, thank you for the response. 




 From Part 1:

*A Zen master once said, "To go eastward one mile is to go westward one mile." This is vital freedom. We should acquire this kind of perfect freedom.*

I didn't understand the metaphor. Can somebody please guide me through it?? 




 But it's 600 pages (short books?? :O ) ah.. I don't normally consider such a pagecount as short by any means. Thanks anyways, pal :) :) 




 Hey, thank you so much for the suggestion.. I picked up Steppenwolf.. the first book i finished in 2015.. it was very good.. in a way i liked it than Siddhartha.. Thanks a lot :)

Do you know of any other books that have such internal voice that speak of life like Steppenwolf did?? If so, plz tell me.. 




 12th January (i.e, today) is Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary and this day is observed as *National Youth Day* in my country, India. He's one of the greatest souls ever lived on this planet, and his teachings are a vibrant inspiration for many. 




 I would be interested in the word count of Stephen King.. he sure seems like a writing machine to me... with at least two books quietly coming out each year.... He's *something*! 




 I logged in so that I can upvote this quote.. 




 Because that's what's on your goddamn mind, pal! 




 This one sentence is the entirety of **Zen**! 




 Yeah.. Mr. Twain is that great! 




 the video is blocked at my work-place... will check it out once i reach my room. Thanks a lot..  




 If you're going into the places with lot of natural touch, then I recommend the essay [*Nature*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29433/29433-h/29433-h.htm) by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Read it and you will not look at the nature with the same perspective as before. 




 Yes I'd already read *Nature* by Emerson.. It was splendid, too. I've never before read something so beautiful about Nature. Very heart warming and soul enriching :)

 




 this photograph deserves more... you should serisouly post this on r/pics.. it will explode :) 




 this is my all-time favourite of Thoreau's quotes. 




  going it alone can be tough

and can also be blissful.. trust me.. the kind of solitude you will experience while travelling and visiting places alone, in a way, such solitude can not be attained even by meditation. It is such. It can be enlightnening, but for that you need to retrsopect into your life and talk to your conscience.. Take some books with you that talk about nature and world around you, even such poetry would do.. Go, explore the solitary travels. Good Luck :)  




 In a way, this quote had helped be take up solo travelling in 2014.. 
*Henry David Thoreau* is my guru in some of the aspects of my life. 




 Indian here.. I have this doubt from a very long time: *Why is Justin Bieber trolled and hated so much in the internet world??* (I know I'm going to be downvoted just for asking this but I needed to ask.) 




 Oh yes.. Definitely. Thank you so much :) 




 Today I was listening to some podcast where the panel members mentioned that in the recent days there are many, many new planets that are being continuously discovered and that most of them are just gas planets. Listening to that I got this doubt: 

*Considering the Big Bang theory, wasn't our Earth too a gas planet at its infancy, which later cooled down and developed into a full fledged life-supporting home? So, if those new planets are now designated as gas planets, doesn't that give way to the possibility of them turning into life suppoorting planets later on in the unvierse's eventual timeline, just like Earth did??* 




 Why in the world am I downvoted for thanking!!!! 




 Yeah that's a good idea.. In my country (India) a recent best selling book series called: *Shiva Trilogy* by Amish Tripati had a smiliar experience. The first book in the series was rejected by nearly 20 publishers.. and so he made a trailer of the book's concept and released it on Youtube.. and also released the first chapter. People liked and the buzz grew around it.. and eventually publishing companies came to him and published his book. Now, his trilogy is a massively famous book series in India. And I even heard that for his next book, which he hasn't even written, a publishing house already bought the rights in advance with a price of around 5 crore rupees.. 

So, yes just try putting a part of it infront of the people and see what happens. 




 I don't understand why publishers/editors reject a book even after thinking it's a good one. How can they decide that a book won't be liked by people when they didn't even publish it? I think they're the most judgemental people on the planet. Really sorry for your situation. But I'm sure something WILL turn up and your book WILL be published.. It's all about the time. Let it take the time it is asking for.. You will surely be rewarded worthily. I will give you an example.. 

*When I was doing masters, almost 80% of my class got recreuited from campus but among the other 20% was one of my best friends in the class.. he tried like all of us but he couldn't get through all that year. Eventaully when the college was over, he left without a job in hand unlike most of his classmates.. He needed a job desperately. He persevered another year, and on Dec 24th, 2013 he was recruited as a Banker by the biggest private bank in India. (Yeah, this is all from India). And his salary is higher than the average salary of the entire batch. Well, he waited and persevered, and he got better than what most people did.*

I believe in such things.. and now in your case also something makes me feel the same way. You will rise! 




  you are totally a reading elitist

I don't know if you ever heard of Chetan Bhagat.. He is India's best selling author.. and also the most criticized.. Well, I'm a great fan of him... Now, me being his fan, in my country if I say I'm an elitist, the actual elite people will beat me to hell. Believe me. If you don't, then google the criticism for Chetan Bhagat.. 

I'm not an elitist. Life is more enjoyable when you have a reading habit.. and having that habit I feel my life is better in terms of interestingness than a non-readers life. That's just my feeling, not an elitist way of looking at the world. If you still feel that way, then I'm sorry, pal. Keep hating me :) 




  [when Frodo left Middle Earth, never to return](/spoiler)

Hey, spoiler alert bro... People exist here, those who didn't yet read LOTR trilogy.. I'm myself one of them. 




 Thanks for the recommendation...  




  so you feel less guilty about being a smug brick

TIL that I'm a smug brick. Thanks :)

Apart from that, I said 'we' because a lot of our comments are misinterpreted. So, I just said that onbehalf of all those people.. But you are misinterpreting that too. How ironic! 




 Ok.. will pick it up.. Thanks. 




  I too would like to know what OP meant by "worthy". 

By that what I meant is that a person who is reading something that *he* feels is interesting to him has the right to feel the work is worthy of investing his own time and concentration, no matter what other people think about it.. For example, many people criticise Dan Brown and Malcom Gladwell, but both are my favourite Fiction and Non-Fiction authors respectively. I feel their books are worthy of my time and thought.. That is all what I meant.. 




 Happy that you found it interesting.. Thank you :) 




 I'm really sorry for my post made you feel that way.. the sole purpose of posting this quote here is.. i like quotes and i like books.. so this quote sounded like it really belongs here, just for people like me to read it.. and fortunately, for the first time in my Reddit life it worked and reached to many... That is all..  




 Roger that, captain.. Thanks for pointing it out.. Will really work on that..  




 Roger that, captain.. I removed the f-words from my comment. I like decent rules.. Thanks :) 




  A.J.Ayer would argue that pure religious talk is nonsense

It may be nonsense for him but surely not for the person that enjoys it.. Our enjoyment of knowledge intake should depend solely on our personal choices.. We have a goddamn right to do that irrespective of how A.J.Ayer or Wittgenstein or Hume or Plato or Socrates feel about it... Let's just use that right! (By the way, I like Plato and Socrates very much.. I just used their names as an example) 




  But that apparently means I'm not a reader. 

Why do you infer that? Who the hell told you that, pal? Reading can be of any form. As long as whatever you read gives you more knowledge about someting worthy, you're a *reader*. Let nobody tell you otherwise, more importantly, you don't tell yourself otherwise! 




 Good work, bro! Let me upvote you now :) 




 Oh, brother, you just inferred a lot of brilliant but unnecessary shit which the quote doesn't even seem to imply.. I'm sorry that it hurt your feelings.. What you said about those countries and cultures might be true, I don't know.. That quote doesn't even in the least bit tell anything about non-readers.. I just posted this quote solely because it appeals to book readers.. I would do the same even if that quote came from goddamn Bermuda Triangle! 




  I don't really appreciate when people discriminate or think they are above others based on their hobbies, and that includes people who think less of people for not reading novels...

Yes.. I'm not being serious when I say I look down upon them.. I know so many damn interesting people who don't read but are fucikn interesting at their minds... That being said, I belive guess the quote only refers to those people that have the habit of reading and how they, and only they, feel when they don't read for long time.. It says nothing about those who don't read.. it's just our own inferring. 




 Deep down, I too feel the same way about those who don't read. Sorry, can't help.. It's so fuckin great feeling. 




 Well, that nails it!
