 I had sociology last semester and there is a word for this. If I remember correctly it's called the second shift. Women who work are still expected to do the cooking and cleaning and laundry and child rearing. Men often cook maybe once a week on a grill and have a Saturday chore of mowing the lawn and washing the car.  




 Can we say butch lesbian instead? That's rather offensive with that phrasing. 




 Did you survive the seizure? 




 There are intersex people and people whose bodies don't quite line up with male and female because they are transitioning.  




 "Doodle Dog is beat and so am I." 




 "Hey baby, did you know that the uh mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell? It's kinda like how these guns are the powerhouse of this." 




 Did you sing the one about the fish with the pig like nose? That's the one I remember, not the song from hsm2  




 I'm also in PA. Going down the shore is a pretty regular thing. 




 I think he should suck it up and just do it. It's just hair. 




 She is over the age of consent and can therefore make a decision on what to do with her body and her baby. She isn't 10. She can legally work and provide for a child. Birth control failure happens. It doesn't make her irresponsible.  




 You know nothing about me or my wife or our relationship other than what is here, which is a poor decision and a shitty family member. You have nothing to draw that conclusion from. Also, you need to learn to spell and figure out what homophones are. 




 I'm sorry that was confusing. She remains cordial so that he will pay for her phone. He pays for her phone because he knows he otherwise won't have her number. I don't communicate with him at all and only see him when needed. I haven't spoken to him since the week after Christmas when he gave my wife her gift. She hasn't spoken to him since except on her birthday two weeks ago. 




 Her father outright states that he despises me. My wife does not want him involved in our lives at all. He abused both of us in the past. I tried to push her to invite him since he is her dad but she didn't want him to know. My family and hers have nothing to do with one another. It was really just having her mom and four sisters not spill the beans. Her three youngest sister didn't say a word, nor did her mother. Her other sister did it intentionally to cause problems. 




 Luckily, I'm not in a sitcom. We needed 5 people not to share and four did it with no problem. Her sister, on the other hand, was purely malicious. 




 Her family acts that way, not my wife. She is just nonconfrontational and doesn't know how to deal with it. Also I'm a woman as well so it has nothing to do with sexism. 




 Go to your county assistance office. Often you can get temporary help for situations like this one. 




 When I was a kid I liked to scratch my head on my dad's beard like this. 




 I probably should but I think I'll be busy deleting Facebook and finding a lawyer. 




 My wife is aware but her family is kind of like, "well that's just (name)." She tried to shove me down some stairs at a Christmas party in front of everyone but then I caught the wall and she ran to the bathroom. I let it go because I wasn't about to be the one in the wrong when parts of her family are just starting to come around after her years of lies. 




 I already didn't want to go. I see it as a waste of money and time. I have never liked these people and since I would otherwise have to stay with my former abuser, I will either have to drive back down or get a hotel. My wife agrees with me about this. 

I think you give really good advice. Even though they are connected, the three are separate issues. Damage control seems to only be possible if we are honest and explain all of it to the family members. My wife plans to deal with her sister after she gives birth. This isn't the first time her sister has done things like this but for us it will be the last. My wife intends to pretty much go no contact with her sister except in regards to her nephew. It is for the best if I don't talk to the sister in law because my anger and hatred will explode and then her father will get involved and it will be ugly as ever.  




 I am a woman, since clearly you can't read.

My wife and I made the decision together to not tell her family, and her sister knew and defied it. I don't need anything else to hate her. She physically attacked me. That's reason enough. 




 The baby is the first of his generation and my wife is expected to be there. This sister is also her only whole sibling; the other three are from her mom's second marriage, so her father has a weird hang up about it. She doesn't have her licence yet and we both have agreed that she is not to be around her father without me. She doesn't want to be around her father at all so she doesn't want to go, but she is a people pleaser and doesn't want to disrupt the family. 




 Yes, yes it does. 




 Her sister was told directly not to tell people and intentionally defied it. 




 Her family is kind of crazy. She has a 37 year old uncle who walks past me and ignores me at family functions. His wife also will only give me dirty looks or talk about her dog. This stupid, immature behavior is the kind of thing I experience every time I'm around them. 

The wedding happened so fast. We went from being in a long term committed relationship to being married in 6 weeks, not even really having an engagement. Since it happened so fast, we didn't get much time to think about who to invite and we decided that no one in my wife's family needed to know besides her mother and four younger sisters. The other family members live far away and we felt that asking them to take a day off of work to drive several hours for a wedding that was mostly just for legal purposes was pointless and unfair, especially since we will be having a big wedding in a year. 

When her cousin asked, we didn't know she knew and assumed it was confusion since it was asked in such a way that that made sense. We were maintaining what we thought they all knew as the truth. 

Our omission was meant to save feelings and avoid hurting people. We also felt that, if we chose to share it, doing so at her other cousin's wedding was not the place. 




 The life lesson is that you can take way more than you think and being able to share that shows what a strong person you are. 




 My wife and I have been married for four months and together four and a half years. We had just begun planning our wedding when we found out that she was set to lose her financial aid for school. We talked to my parents and her mom and they all understood that unless we got married, my wife had to drop out. We didn't want anyone to know since it happened really fast and we couldn't afford to invite anyone. It was in the middle of the day on a Wednesday so no one could have really made it anyway. In an effort to avoid hurt feelings we only had our immediate families there. We put on Facebook that we were engaged.

My wife's sister, who was 18 and pregnant at the time, instead scheduled a doctors appointment and skipped her sister's wedding. She has tried to sabotage our relationship from the beginning; she has told both of my wife's parents terrible lies about me and has even physically attacked me before. She only knew we were getting married because she lived with my wife's mom at the time. 

My wife's cousin got married this weekend and we were asked by her other cousin if we were married. We said no, as that is what we agreed upon. We found out that her sister told the family that we are in fact married. I am livid. It was not her place to do that and I'm tired of her invading my life whenever she can. My wife's father, who abused my wife and I in the past, was also not supposed to know, but we are sure she told him as well.

She is being induced this Wednesday and I have made it clear that I will not be driving two hours to her father's house to see her. My mother in law is angry that I won't do this but I can't stand my father in law or sister in law. My wife agrees but doesn't want trouble. What should I do?

Tl;dr: sister in law is an asshole and I'm expected to coddle her. 




 Rand Paul thinks same sex couples should just have "contracts" not marriages or unions.

 The thumbnail looks like a dick. 




 When twox became a default, I had discovered trollx and I unsubbed over there and never looked back. 




 No, not really. Men are assertive or leaders or have a take charge personality. Those are all considered positive. 




 You're right. *Most* people aren't, but these types of things seem to draw the creepy neckbeards out of the woodwork. It's probably too late to get enough bathroom attendants now.  









 ... Have you actually been on Reddit? Creepshots from conventions like this are a regular thing. 









 You should also probably leave out hermaphrodite as well. A hermaphrodite is truly both 100% male and 100% female which doesn't happen in humans. 




 Women, who push for things, are called bossy bitches. 




 Intersex is the word you are looking for. 




 Yep. Transmen are porn penis free.

Edit: not porn. Born. 




 I haven't really played since 2010 and I don't want to allow myself to get sucked back in. 




 I wouldn't say the parent is a creep but in that position I would remind my child that genital touching is to be done alone. 




 It's TIL, it isn't supposed to he current events. 




 Well that's like, your opinion man. 




 Oh god if I ever need something to make me childfree this is it. 




 This law just changed where I live. I'm a social work student and it's preposterous that until now a degree in engineering makes you qualified to be a case worker. 




 It may be different in Germany, but in the US ultrasounds are internal unless there is a problem or you are pregnant enough that external will work. 




 99% of fire departments in Pennsylvania are volunteer. 




 Perhaps you should consider attending a PFLAG meeting to help you come out. 




 It totally is! How did your mom as a nun have a child? I assume she was not a nun before you so how did she decide to be come a nun? How old were you? How has it affected you? What are some weird rules nuns have to follow? My uncle is a monk and they can't dance with women. Where is your dad? It is REALLY interesting.  




 No, it wouldn't. In that case it is not sexually transmitted. If you rim someone with cholera you can get cholera but that doesn't make it an sti. 




 Congratulations, pain in the butt!  




 If you don't want the kid to be a brat, stop humble bragging. Don't teach that behavior.  




 Maybe you should be more grateful for gifts and less controlled by your husband. 




 Do an AMA! 




 Thank you, kind stranger, who knows one fact about my relationship.  




 Actually she's sitting next to me at Friendly's across from my Nigeria best friend. 




 She's gay. I can say with 100% certainty that she's never banged a dude. 




 I'd be risking my relationship if she realized too late that she can't handle it. She doesn't want to sleep with anyone else. 




 Hey baby. You dropped something. My jaw. 




 I was 15 and it was also too soon. 




 I didn't save myself for marriage, but my wife and I started dating when I was 15. She knows that I totally want to sleep with other people and I have her permission to explore. I just love her too much to risk it all for an hour of fun.  




 No, I think women just want someone experienced. I'm a lesbian. I would not sleep with or date a virgin. There is just too much responsibility in making sure you don't fuck their first time up. Maybe it's because women put more emotional value in virginity loss and to men it's more of an accomplishment.

All my opinions based on generalizations of course.  




 For real. Best tweezer I ever lost* were a dollar from ELF.

*I lose all tweezers. 




 If you hate everyone, why watch? 




 I seriously hope someone beat you to the punch. 




 That's the best part of neckbeards! 




 I live a few hours from Philly, where the Mazzoni(sp?) center is, which is where most of my friends got their T. I keep thinking about using some of this money to do that, but I didn't think I wanted hormones right now. 

I have round about discussed being trans with my mom and she is 100% not on board. My dad makes comments about transpeople that say he is the same. My wife would be fine with it, as we have discussed it at length, but we currently live with my parents. 

I'm just really not sure where I am right now on all of this and it sucks. I generally don't bother to bind because it doesn't really work anyway but when I do my dysphoria is all but gone. I am open with my whole family about the fact that top surgery is an inevitability and they all seem okay with it as I've explained it that my chest is too big, but a reduction can put me at higher risk for cancer so they're on board. 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place but any insight would help. 




 Reddit doesn't seem to understand that choice is just that - choice. The hive mind says that it's our decision (as almost an entirely male population) who has to have an abortion. They don't believe women should have the choice to *not* abort. 




 Stepping up to take care of family members he doesn't have to = chump. 

I'd hate to be related to you. 




 True, but Hillary is an old dog in the game. She's been around longer. 




 I agree but someone super left won't get elected.  




 She changed her position on that issue. On a personal level, she doesn't feel that "marriage" is the best word but she doesn't politically believe in taking away other's rights.  




 I haven't shaved since December and will maybe shave two more times this year. I don't grow body hair quickly and it's thin and blonde when I do. I'm more masculine anyway so screw it. My wife has PCOS and grows hair so fast you can hear it. She Nairs every other week and I only hate when it's in the stubble stage.  




 Your welcome for the new fetish. Seriously though could you imagine Elizabeth Warren as President with Rachel Maddow as our first lady? 




 I've told my wife that I would leave her for Elizabeth Warren. She said that's fine as long as she can have Rachel Maddow. Elizabeth Warren is going to be president someday, I firmly believe, but that day is not today. She is just too wonderful for the right to go for it. 




 Aside from her last name, why not her? 




 And the right would say it was a cat fight and neither would get elected. I don't think having two women from the left run at the same time for our first female president is going to be a good idea. 




 A vote for a third party is a waste of your vote. You know it won't actually go anywhere, better to go for the better of the two evils. 




 Disclaimer: I'm left than left and love Elizabeth Warren.

She is too left. Hillary is much more moderate and older, helping to secure votes. She is a known name and not for rocking the boat out right on things that people more right don't want rocked. Elizabeth Warren can't secure the votes because she is too young and too new and too left for the comfort of most. I also doubt that she will run and step on Hillary Clinton's toes to try to be the first female president, which I personally find admirable. If they both run, the right will construe it as a sexist cat fight and that will make them both lose. 

Personally, I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I like her and what she stands for. 




 It's against reddiquette to post personal information.  




 I graduated in 2012 in the Poconos. I was on the rifle team and it still exists, shooting .22 rifles in the range on school grounds. 




 Well being is affected by the law though in this case. 




 Typically in video games, when the player gets frustrated and flips out and quits playing. 




 When you ask someone out, it's assumed that you will pay and it makes you look cheap not to.  




 At first I thought maybe you were a troll, but I checked your profile out and apparently you are rage quitting. Isn't there somewhere more entertaining to do that? 




 Want to see my skin that has had maybe a dozen pimples in my lifetime that looks even better since following my routine? Didn't think so, but I thought I'd offer. 




 Guys listen up we have a skincare genius in our midst. 




 I think that grouping other people that way is wrong and counterintuitive but when people group themselves a certain way it's not really wrong to theorize why. I'm not saying that a transman is the same as a woman or vice versa but there is a common element. 




 And femme lesbians for being invisible and passing as straight.  




 Transpeople are certainly their transitioned-to gender from birth, but transmen experience objectification by men from a young age and transwomen are told that trucks and sports are what they need to be in to. They experience society as their assigned sex until transition, when they experience it from their gender.  




 Well, people are socialized as children based on their assigned gender. That's a pretty common theme. 




 From what I've seen, you're correct. Afab people like tumblr because it's more pro afab people, where reddit is more amab oriented.  




 That's like saying men aren't privileged because of Women's colleges and whites aren't privileged because there are Black Student Unions or straights aren't privileged because of gay bars.

Edit: I'm not saying my answers are right, just that groups are definitely privileged. I don't think it's possible to prove that masculine gay men are not the most privileged group of lgbt people, aside from perhaps straight transmen that pass extremely well. 




 I'm a genderqueer lesbian, so my perspective is skewed, but here is how I see it:

Gay men, particularly masculine bear types on top; rather "normal" and the male privilege to boot. Feminine gay men are a close second.

Lesbians, femme on top with varying degrees of butch behind them. 

Then, we have branches. Transmen get male privilege when they pass but all the medical advances really give transwomen the privilege, so it is really about which matters more to the individual. As a whole, society doesn't love transpeople. 

Bi people fall within their respective gay/straight depending upon their relationship at the time, though they deal with erasure based on their relationships. If they are with someone they are immediately either gay or straight and whores if they are single or have multiple partners.  




 Totally easy; pigtails = avoid; spikes = new best friend. 




 Not a chart, but a summary. 

Everyone (gay and straight) call bi people whores, so they don't like anyone.

Lesbians don't like bi people because of too many "bi" girls who just want to experiment. This fuels bi hatred of lesbians because they claim it is "bi erasure".

Transpeople think that everyone hates them so they hate everyone first. Straight people think they are just really gay, gay people think gender and sexuality shouldn't be lumped.

Gay men hate more feminine gay men for being attention whores.

Lesbians don't like straight men because they feel objectified; straight men in turn feel that lesbians try to out-masculinize them. 

I think that's about it. 




 Actually, they *can* just let you hang free. They don't tell boys to wear briefs to make their nuts look better. 




 No. Trans*vest*ites wear the clothes. Trans*gender* people are the gender. 




 No need! I was just confused at first that I thought I fixed it and it was back and then I was confused that four minutes later I got another notification about it lol. 




 Did you even look to see that someone else already told me lol?

 *^ this is why transguys get annoyed on here.  

Edit: you can't take criticism and he is trolling? Bullshit. 




 If you rent your landlord can lose their house for your possession. You have to buy somewhere so a deal gone bad *can* happen. Regardless of what you want to be true, most drugs *are* illegal so yes, that's an issue. Because of that major difference, you cannot realistically draw a comparison with drinking and gambling.  




 Maybe he opted as an adult to be circumcised because of phimosis. 




 Just support your guy. My wife's father hates me. We have been together 4.5 years but his 2 year relationship to his 2nd/4th wife is more valid than ours. I avoid her father because he is awful. 




 If the nurse at school ever did that to my child we would have a MAJOR issue. 




 I down voted you. It *is* still a problem. You put the entire household at risk if you are caught. You run the risk of falling back into addiction instead of just use. You risk a deal gone bad and your mother coming to identify your body. If you have children you put their lives and sense of normalcy at risk. It's not "fine". 




 Call and find out! Worst they can say is  no! 




 McDonald's carries them now!

 I crave Italian food so much when I have my period. Though, at first I thought this was a horrible marinara sauce joke. 




 My wife and I went to Olive Garden for dinner tonight for our 4 months married/4.5 years together anniversary. I was holding the door for a couple coming out and the man called me sir! I wasn't even trying to pass, just wearing a striped shirt and sports bra over Levis and he called me sir! Then he corrected himself but who cares because I got called sir! 




 With the added benefit of lacerations! 




 Health care for everyone? Removal of DADT? Federally recognized same sex marriage? 




 So its like your dad was Danny Devito and your hubby is Arnold Schwarzenegger but they are actually secretly twins? 




 The problem is that a lot of dads really do this and it's not a good thing. 




 Sadly, yes, plenty of them are. Though, if you recognize this I'm guessing you aren't.  




 Hey, if you didn't do it, don't feel bad. But work to combat the behavior in your loved ones that a male. 




 That's not a great mentality to have, either. You don't own them any more than another man does. They own their own bodies. Yes, when they are young and don't know any better you need to protect them, but they aren't your objects either.  




 I agree. But she isn't stupid. She must know that exactly that is going to happen. She is still making the choice to do it. That doesn't make the actions of the guys here okay, but it is still her body and her choice. 




 It's a start. Generally my comments on defaults are down voted to hell. Maybe someone will realize that it's true in all situations.  




 I'm gonna let you go back and reread. 




 How is it anti feminist? Her body, her choice.  




 Really, slavery only existed about 150 years ago. That could mean that your great great grandparents had slaves, meaning someone not as distant as you think. Also, slavery ending wasn't racism ending. Schools were only forced to integrate a bit more than 60 years ago; I'm 20 and my dad was born before schools were integrated. That's no reason to apologize for someone else's actions, but it wasn't as long ago as it should have been, and knowing that hits a little closer to home.  




 I'm 20 and married, to another woman. It's double the screaming ovaries and the "well we are married..." but we also have no degree and live with my parents and it has to wait but try to tell all these ovaries that.  




 Be careful with Capella. It's like University of Phoenix and often you can't get a job because you went there. The degree isn't worth the paper it's written on. 




 I, too, breathed out my nose. 




 That's not a relationship and the fact that you call it one goes on to prove your insecurity.  




 It has nothing to do with ratio. It has to do with peace and quiet. There are 6 people in my three bedroom house. There is no where that is calm and quiet but the bathroom. 




 I screwed up royally and dropped 18 credits this semester due to my mom being diagnosed with cirrhosis and my being depressed and a whole host of other issues.  I had previously dropped 9 credits and repeated 3 of them. I have 25 credits complete of 52 attempted at this point and am working on my appeal. If I retake classes, does that lower my attempted number? Right now I know I need 30 credits in the next semester to get it back, which is impossible. Do I get a year or just a semester? Should I repeat classes? It's a 2 year program. 




 You are aware that this sub is an ama sub not change my view, correct? I am in no way obligated to debate my identity with you.
