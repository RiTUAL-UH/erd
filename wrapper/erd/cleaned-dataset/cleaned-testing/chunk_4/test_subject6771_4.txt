 taking the rebel flag down is a good thing but ultimately ineffective b/c it's not going to fix gun control but it does give ppl a tangible outlet for them to focus their energy into and that's a pretty good distraction. 

 




 special treatment? http://i.imgur.com/iIOJ0X7.jpg

this dude shot 16 ppl. not trying to compare bad apples to bad apples but i don't think there is any special treatment going on. just look at all that white privilege.

if they did have have anything in common it's that they were both obnoxious baby-faced racist sociopaths who liked killing.

 Hello and thank you for your submission. Unfortunately it has been removed due to the following:

You can submit any link if it is the original source, but rehosting services such as imgur should only be used when the original source is unknown or has been lost. You can use services such as Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye to find the original source.

If you have any questions feel free to msg the mods or reply back to this.

 it wasn't a matter of the post getting removed. i could care less about that. it was his wording and bluesmoke's comments the other day that leave me thinking theyre attacking me.  




 am i not a user too? whats the deal with the new mods having a hard-on for me? 

  There's no excuse for you to have missed it.

accidents happen, things get overlooked. i did scroll the front page but i didn't see it. 

edit: i love a good cutaway, you can't fault me for that

double edit: i remove reposts all the time in /r/art. but i don't get bent out of shape about it.

 i'm wondering if they repair the broken section and kinda of force it back into place like a bicycle chain. seems highly unlikely tho w/o a make-shift crane to lift the chassis up.
