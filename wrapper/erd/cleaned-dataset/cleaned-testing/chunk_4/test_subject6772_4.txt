 I am wondering how he even learned of that.  









 I'm getting a bag of peanuts for it - nothing like peanuts for the circus, makes the dog and pony show all that more authentic. 


































 Ahhh, conservatives. Less than 1% of those on welfare are abusing the system - so they want to dismantle it.

Gun owners.Less than 1% use them to shoot others. Suddenly the right is all like "You can't judge all by the few! Most are good, law abiding patriotic Americans." 









 When I don't want to pay my bills I put them in a bag and leave them in the park as well. Hasn't worked yet, I still owe em all. 









 "People complain about 'muslim' on non-muslim crime and it gets all over the news, but what about american on american crime? How come that doesn't get talked about? Wonder how soon x/y/z will show up pimping how non-muslims are being discriminated against by muslims?" 

Funny how all that sounds when you take what the right says about crimes involving blacks and apply it elsewhere..... 
























 We might spend more on porn that politics, but the antacids we buy are because of politics. 












































 Do whites treat other whites poorly at times? Do they discriminate against other whites (like Irish, etc)?

Weird how this works. Some just assume all blacks see all other blacks as the same but when it comes to whites they don't expect that. 

Does it help to be better represented when it comes to race, class, etc and so on? I would say it does. Does that automatically solve all the problems in the system? I would say it doesn't.

So you can have a legit gripe about being represented on X but that doesn't always lead to Y and Z. 

The right only hears one thing when it comes to this issue. 




 That's cute. The idea is that government employees are abusing power (like the right complains about with Obama, but didn't with bush...weird. Anyway,) and have been doing so and getting away with it.

The justice system favors some over others. A point the people were protesting about. I don't think people were complaining that those who were abusing power were all white, but were all in a position of power.

Now...are blacks sentenced, arrested, charged, pulled over, etc in a disproportionate amount? If so - isn't that something worth looking at? Does it matter who does it? 

Weren't white people (jews/pols/gays/etc) killed by other whites in ww2? Are you saying that if they complained they were being targeted that they had no case because they were all white?

Classicism, etc, are all real problems. But leave it to someone to ignorantly yell "There are some black cops, so all is ok! Git r done buddies!" 




 We need Issa and Gowdy on this, stat. 15 investigations and millions of dollars and we should know right around election time. 














 When people are used to being abused by cops - either unwarranted stops, searches, etc - they might just have a case for avoiding them quickly. 

Waco and Ruby Ridge - why didn't people just obey the cops? Bundy Ranch - why didn't they guy just pay the fine, why did so many show up with guns?

The right seems to have no problem in justifying their distrust of government but when others do it they suddenly get all weird. You watch the protests? When cops were approaching many people ran - why didn't the cops just beat em and shoot em? Maybe because they knew it was wrong...when the cameras were rolling. 




 So that's how he works. "Well, this sounds like something I can use to bash someone, so I will just read it on air."

Wonder if he will follow up on it?

"Why, I am never wrong, I just read things as though it were factual from people who are wrong." And the right laps it up "We don't need to fact check anything, we believe it! Just like we believe Obama ordered a stand down at Benghazi!" 




 Maybe because he claims he is never wrong, and conservatives believe him. But then...they think fox is a legit new source. 









 *He was a victim of a system that is just waiting for an excuse to attack, and he gave the system that reason. If you poke a bear you should not be surprised if you are bitten*

And if you're caught speeding don't be surprised if a government employee beats you. I mean, after all, you gave them a reason to interact with you. Heck, the person pulled over has probably sped many times so they obviously have total disregard for the law.

By the way, what crime was he guilty of that they chased him down? 









 The blame I see has more than one facet.

The war on (some) drugs. Targeting areas, using tickets/etc as a revenue source, and so on. 

As I said before, I can blame individuals and the system. I can't fix individuals, but we can work and fix the system and the people we pay to manage that system.

Not in favor of the riot side, but large protests and stuff do seem to get the message out. Think about the 60's and civil rights and vietnam. 

That does not mean I can't try to understand why people do what they do (even if I don't agree with their actions). Simply dismissing things as people being hoods/thugs/etc is easy but ignores underlying causes.

It is like how the right says "Muslims over there in the middle east are bad, do bad things, and hate us fer our freedoms! Git R Done!" and don't stop to think for a minute about the causes behind some of the things - like us overthrowing their leaders, etc.

Simple minded people see simple minded solutions. They usually watch fox and listen to rush who play to that. 














 He's doing better than that Pizza place in Indiana :) 




 So many things work well in theory that don't in reality.

Let's look at ole bush. Torture happens, he skates. Cheney shoots some guy in the face, meh. 

Big companies screw the country and get bailouts. Companies contribute to deaths, basically steal from people, etc and pay a small fine.

All things people have exposed and the justice system ignores. What was is the conservatives have been saying since 2008? Something about the tree of liberty, etc....

You think the people in Ferguson hadn't been trying to make changes for years? It took the protests to get real reports on the corruption and change to start.

The people in power (and those with money) have to have the will to change things. They get lazy and comfortable until some things wake them up.

Ferguson and Baltimore both got people talking about issues they generally ignore - which is weird because we have so many 24x7 news stations. Politicians can get elected and try to do something, but then party politics take over and legislation and funding go nowhere. 














 That made no sense.

*So why was this kid, and so many others, happy to give the corrupt police a reason to screw them?*

Your saying that corrupt cops needs chances/reason to act corrupt and then blame the victim for not avoiding them? So...if you go 5 mph over the speed limit and a cop stops you and beats the crap out of you then you are at fault? Hunh. Weird.

Sounds like conservative style thinking about an issue. "Why, if them folks in Iraq had kicked out Saddam like we wanted, we wouldn't have had to bomb em up real good!" 




 *"Not one of the officers involved in this tragic situation left home in the morning with the anticipation that someone with whom they interacted would not go home that night,"*

Yeah, I am sure just about every criminal can claim the same. Funny how these people don't care about police abuse of power, people getting charged with 'resisting', ticketed for filming cops or being harassed by them, etc.

Now, suddenly, they want people to stop and think about things.

Suck when you get treated how you treat others, don't it. 




 Conservatives see the people as the problem. Liberals see both the people and the system as having flaws. 

You can't fix a problem you don't believe exists. 




 I am not interested in individuals and their personal problems - from what crimes they have done to anything else.

People in government with power that abuse it, though, is something we should care about and can do something about. We pay them, they work for us. 

Cops are to protect/serve. When cops fail at that we should come down on them for failing to do their job. I would think conservatives would be all for that.

When you have a system that is a mess we should be outraged. The justice system screws over people daily. That is part of why the US has more people in prison than other countries. People on the right tend not to pay attention to this (in fact, they see a way to make money from it with private prisons/etc).

Their usual solutions are things like "get a job", "more prayer in schools" and so on. All because those things require no thinking. The deep issues that exist get glossed over and ignored in favor of what people see in a rather twisted light "I haven't been arrested, beaten, screwed over by the system - so you can avoid it to if you act like me!"

And what that is your solution - you haven't seen the real problem at all. 




 And countries like Norway and Sweden have a lot more social safety nets....so what are you saying?

Disparities in justice system by people abusing their power has nothing to do with the citizens and what benefits they get. 
 
























 You keep saying "dem/republican".

There are plenty of people in both parties who lean conservative or liberal on some issues. I am talking about core values - not party.

*I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.*

As a former LEO I can tell you that is, indeed, a problem. That problem gets exacerbated by the the entire justice system - but yes, it starts with the cops IMHO (not always).

When people in a certain area are targeted for enforcement than in other areas you get a lot more 'crime' suddenly. Jay walking, riding a bike with no helmet, 'speeding/distracted driving/rolling stops' etc and so on.

Those people now have to take time from work for court, pay more fines, etc than people in other areas. All the while other people do the same and get ignored - and then those people point to those other areas/people start to get biased and demand more police to bust more people. 




 No, Mr. Bush, the processed worked this one time out of many. If you spoke about these issues more (social injustice, abuse of power in the justice system) I might take you more seriously. 














 As expected people totally miss it. 

Cons are rushing to push the whole meme "It's a dem city, so we don't expect there would be social issues" which is kind of funny when you think about it....

The two groups look at the issue in a different way. I don't care the politics of the city. People in power in either party can, and do abuse power. So this isn't about party politics but about perception of real issues.

Conservatives blow off those who have regular problems and side with those in government and stand up for them (unless, of course, it's that one guy in Office, Obama). They blame the victims of government power abuse and incompetence.

Liberals tend to see the issue as something that is fundamentally wrong with the system and how it works, while also saying if someone did something wrong they should be held accountable. But many aren't because they aren't poor, minority, etc. 

I would think the right would care about unequal justice and abuse of the system against the citizens. But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.

Pretend like it was obama making the arrest and someone dying. Issa/Gowdy would do 15 investigations, fox would carry it 24x7 and demand justice. 









 Not even really talking about Ferguson. I am talking about issues every day across the US when it comes to cops and the justice system. Ferguson was about that build up, so was Baltimore. There were breaking points. The right is quick, especially now, to dismiss and use Ferguson to say "See, there wasn't any issue at all!" when the point protestors were making is crap happens every damned day.

Sure, some of it is small (being harassed, pulled over a lot, etc by cops). But some is larger. Extra charges tacked on, unequal protection and so on.

Conservatives tend to only care about a few big incidents ignoring the elephant in the room. 









 And so it begins. From fox to hannity to rw sites across the web.....

People who generally ignore the plight of people who have complained for decades about problems with the justice will suddenly pay attention and find fault it in .

When it's blacks, indians, hispanics, poor people getting screwed over every single day they just shrug and tell em "If you wouldn't have got arrested you wouldn't be in this situation, obey the law, get a job, etc"

Sure as hell though when one of said group are unarmed and die by cop they are out there setting up gofundme's for the cop(s), raging out injustice etc.

We get it conservatives, we really do :) 




 I can hear conservatives across the country saying that now.

All the while they have ignored this as a real problem in some communities for years and told people to quit whining about it.

Suddenly though, they seem critical of a system.

Funny how that works. 














 It goes like this. There were several investigations done that found nothing. Then there is another investigation that drags on and you want it to drag on more, so you order those other documents to slow things down.

Imagine if 9/11/2001 were investigated like this, it would still be going on. Some things would be classified, then there would be court battles over a few of them, they get released, then more and and when it's all done there is another investigation just for the hell of it and you slowly ask for all that same documentation as before *and* new docs to explore what people said about those other docs later...

It's like the never ending story. Well...until the election. Then suddenly it will wrap up with what we learned the first time. 










































































 I dunno, but mine's been 'frozen' for 6 years. Will see if someone from /r/gonewild will taste it and see if it's still good. Only way to be sure. 




 Told them to be scared of Iraq, now Iran, and fed into their fears. Conservatives are emotional creatures who are afraid of everything and anyone not straight, white, and Christian. Republicans stoke those fears and promise to play daddy for them and keep them safe.

It makes them feel better and not alone in their psychosis. It's not just them as individuals believing the poor people are destroying America by asking for help with food and medical care, they have people in office that whisper to them. Now they aren't alone in the things they imagine. 




 Might have been if this was Springfield Elementary.

http://imgur.com/r3xJlo5 
























 And if 1+1 doesn't equal 3 they will find a way to blame Obama/Benghazi for why. 




 Now, now. Don't confuse a conservative with facts. You know they all live off of emotions and beliefs (Hey, the bible said the earth is only 6,000 years old - that is real science!).

I bet the person who posted this will be here any minute now to assure us this is a true and honest depiction of things (because Jesus told them how we must all work to eat and such....) 




 Wait...what? I read the article. Did you?

*In August, his boss is shutting down Z Pizza and putting him and his 11 co-workers out of work.*

And then.... *So she has to give raises within the next two years.*

So what it seems like to me is that the owner is using this as an excuse. Funny how the right ditches analysis and such in cases like this.

But, hey, conservatives go for emotion because they are always lacking on facts (how did that whole 'Obama ordered a stand down with Benghazi' work out for you?? Ohhh...right.) 















































































 Riiiight. Oh wait, it's from a conservative, no wonder it is so dumb.

Riot-plagued? LOL. And hey, maybe if cons weren't the ones raising funds for cops who kill unarmed black people they might see where the real problem is.

Carry on conservatives, I needed a laugh and a reason to feel superior to some fundie idiots today :) 


































 How do you kill someone over the phone, is there an app for that? 


































 Maybe not, but some think it is worth a shot. 







































 Why, I thought it was lack of prayer in school. Or does that just cause riots after buckeye games?

I think it is more a breakdown of our social justice system than anything. 



















 If you need help grasping for those straws let us know and someone might get you a hand. 









 HAHAHAHA OMG the conservatives fell for this???

Go to hillary's twitter account. I'll wait. Ok, you go there? Tell us, do you see the thing that tweets by Hillary are signed "-H"?

Was that in the tweet they are whining about? No? Hunh....guess they blew a dog whistle and people came running without thinking.

A sure sign of a conservative. 




 He must be correct because conservatives have been promoting what some Iranians have said about nuke negotiations. Obviously they are just telling the truth. 




 Cons think violence against brown people is normal - whether from cops, prisons, or bombing them in other countries. They applaud the solution - until those same people engage in violence. Then...suddenly...violence is wrong and should be covered, talked about, etc.

They are licking their chops on this right now. They promote every negative story on iran, muslims, blacks, and raise funds for cops that shoot people and spending on wars/weapons. Funny how it all works in their minds. 




 Peaceful things aren't news to most people, it's what we expect. 

But it is worth noting how some say "Violence doesn't accomplish anything." - unless of course it is the military, and then magically violence is the answer to all the problems in the world.

Funny how that works with some people. 









 I get what it is here in politics. I just wish I could get why crap spewed by Mike Huckabee isn't. I mean, we post political things all the time from writers who aren't even politicians and never have been but Huckabee gets the 'off topic' label. Weird. 




 Cops kill/shoot/beat blacks and the justice system screws them and the rw shrugs. Black commits a crime and suddenly they care about the race side.

We get it :) 

















































 Here's one story
http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2015/04/27/north-thurston-high-school-shooter/26449025/ 




 Source  TV news station in WA (I cropped the image because original shows the phone number, hopefully they will fix that on their website) 
























 My dick. 




 I thought it was god? Well, I guess to some they are the same thing. 




 My personal take on it:

Obi Wan was there to look after Luke on Tatooine and set him on his path/protect him. By dying here he was able to better aid Luke now in the long term and continue his mission. 

Both he and Luke now progressed and Vader was under the impression that the last of the Jedi's was gone, which upped his arrogance that it was just he, the emperor, and the empire. Yoda was surely too old and probably dead, Obi Wan gone, there was no one left to teach, so his guard on that front would be down.

Again, just my guess :) 














 Weird, posted the same thing the other day and it was labeled 'off topic'. I kind of think it is on topic.... 




 We have had a bush in the whitehouse for 20 years out of the past 35. I am sure we can find someone else in this large country of ours that can handle the job. 



















 Cool. Thanks for the answer. One more Q? If you were to recommend a service to someone outside your coverage area what would you recommend and barring that what would you personally suggest what sort of things would you tell people to look for/against?

Not in the market myself but eventually might be when I move in a few years. I am just not overly trusting of alarm companies (no rational reason off the top of my head, just one of them things). 




 Have you installed any system into your house? 














 Any article that uses 'gaystapo' is written by an uneducated conservative (yeah, I know, redundant).  




 Fox news. Probably not planes at all. I was shocked though that they didn't mention benghazi in the article. They must be slipping.  




 GOP: "Stop gays, food stamps, unemployment, make people have ID's for voting and welfare, track their spending and limit it!"

"Can we get a rundown of the security expenses of that guy we elected?"

GOP: "Hell no!" 

















































 I think this is assuming people are 'making' things. It is hard to measure productivity this way, especially when the idea is that every minutes equals 'money'.

But am guessing there will be companies that will run with this. 

















































 Let me guess. You're a conservative. Now, now, don't clap, it wasn't hard to figure out. Take something that someone didn't say, pretend they did, and presto - you have something you can try to use to bolster an argument you know you will lose if you don't (welfare/dependency). 

Now, one could note the year of the article, 2011. Which means you are probably just trolling for comments (another sign of a conservative who can't win arguments).

But hey, carry on, fun to see cons squirming and twisting. Makes me all happy :) 




 In the US it is practiced by drunk people. 









 "Amid mounting political pressure, the ATF last month put the bullet ban on the back burner, but left the door open for future rule-making."

Um, was there a way to 'close the door'? If not then they didn't leave the door open they just didn't decide at this time to do it.

Against the ban myself. Since most crimes involving the shooting of cops aren't planned and arise out of circumstance I don't think there is much basis to ban these because of cops. If someone is planning on killing a cop, any old bullet would do if you plan it out. 




 So what? According to conservatives all you have to do is work harder. Sure, you might work 2 or 3 jobs, but if you aren't getting all you want in life from work that is your fault.

And now someone is trying to blame, what, blame immigrants? LOL. Ok.

Remember when republicans voted against an extension for unemployment benefits? They said aid to those unemployed made them lazy and if they cut aid those lazy people would get jobs?

According to them there are tons of jobs out there. And the only reason your income is dropping is you are lazy and you aren't training yourself for new jobs.

And now they are trying to blame immigrants?? Yeah...get your message straight.
