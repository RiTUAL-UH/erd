 As a native Kentuckian, it really sucks living in pretty much the only oasis of liberal politics in the sea of Republicans and Tea Party crazies ... 




 Well, what happens now largely depends on you and your girlfriend. If your girlfriend is asexual (although it seems possible that she's in the gray-area), that doesn't necessarily mean that you can no longer sustain a relationship, but you will have to make some decisions as a couple.

First, she probably needs some time to figure out how she feels about sex. Just because someone is asexual doesn't mean they won't ever have sex; there is a lot of variation among aces, just like with everyone else. Some aces can't stand sex and don't ever want to have it. Others are pretty neutral toward it and don't really care either way. Others actually do enjoy sex. The key to asexuality is not necessarily that the person doesn't have an interest in sex (although this is pretty common), just that they don't experience sexual attraction. It is possible that your girlfriend will still have sex with you, or perhaps she will decide that she's not comfortable with that. It's up to her. Just give her time, don't pressure her into making up her mind right away, and make sure to respect her decision when she does make it.

Now on to you. It seems like you have a real problem with the idea that your girlfriend might not be sexually interested in you. A lot of people with asexual partners have similar issues, probably because in general sexual attraction is seen as a prerequisite for love in our culture. People typically develop a physical attraction and then a romantic one, or both happen simultaneously, so if you find out that your partner isn't physically attracted to you it can make you seriously question the legitimacy of your relationship. If I would hazard a guess, I'd say that this might be part of why you are feeling hurt right now. That's okay. This sort of thing can be difficult to handle. However, I just want you to be aware that for asexual people, a lack of physical attraction does not mean that they love you any less. They just love you in a different way.

I hope that this helps, feel free to ask any other questions. Hopefully you and your girlfriend will also be able to figure things out, and good luck in the future. 




 Lol that was definitely a wise decision on your part. My roommate suggested that and he got sooooo much hate mail for it. 




 Yeah, if you ship Irene and Sherlock you will be torn apart on Tumblr. There are so many fans who will viciously defend the Johnlock ship because they have to protect their cute gays and womenz are just a distraction. Strangely enough, though, nearly all the fanatic Johnlock fans are cishet women .... 




 Yep. That's one of my biggest issues with the show. It really sucks that the writers are deliberately feeding into the way that the fans ship the two of them together, all of which is just exploitative and really icky if you ask me. 




 I imagine that a lot of trans* people also have clothes dysphoria, but I don't really consider myself transgender or genderqueer or anything really past crossdressing, because that dysphoria doesn't extend to my body. I'm actually pretty apathetic about being physically female. I identify as female because it's convenient, but if tomorrow I woke up male I wouldn't really care that much.

Also, I'd definitely say that she was in complete denial about her own bi/homophobia. A lot of people just don't realize that stuff like that is totally prejudiced. And no, your orientation has nothing to do with your partner's orientation - that's basically implying that you and your partner aren't separate people with your own individual tastes. That's silly. More accurately, your orientation might conflict with your partner's gender identity, but gender identity and sexual orientation aren't the same thing. Some people believe that orientation only relates to physical characteristics, so someone who is a heterosexual woman is attracted to penises, and therefore to be "straight" they can only date cis men. I think that's a little off, because trans men are still men and trans women are still women, so you can be straight even if you date trans people, assuming that they identify as the opposite gender. Perhaps this is what she was really referring to? But even in that case it's still shitty because it's transphobic. Either way, she's not being fair to you.

I can also relate to that idea of coming to terms with being a part of the LGBT community. I think part of the problem is that queer communities can be just as hierarchical as the general population. Plus, often times people who don't fit into the prescribed narrative of what it means to be "gay" or "trans" or whatever are ostracized. A lot of people try to argue that asexuals aren't really queer, for instance, because we are just "acting like we're special for attention" or "because we aren't really discriminated against" or because we have passing privilege. There's also unfortunately a lot of gay, cis people who don't like including other identities and orientations in the queer rights movement because they make things "too complicated." Too bad human beings are all really complicated and none of us fit perfectly into neat little box. 




 Um ... that's not what I was talking about. Of course there are different interpretations of what Sherlock's actual orientation is. I'm referring to how the show constantly makes gags about "SHERLOCK AND JOHN TOTALLY LOOK LIKE A GAY COUPLE HAR HAR" 




 I'm mostly happy with who I am too, it's just the occasional nagging in the back of my brain. But it's about the same as other people thinking things like "If only I could shed a few pounds" or "If only I were good at sports" etc. 




 Yeah, the only time I ever play COD or Halo is with people I know IRL that aren't total assholes.  




 I dunno. Honestly shit like that is basically why I will never really get into fighting games or FPS. I'm just not that great at them to begin with, and putting up with that sort of harassment and constant sexism is too exhausting.

I will take anybody on at Galaga, though! : 




 Yeah, I often think things like "It would be easier if I were straight" or "I wonder if my SO would find our relationship more fulfilling if I were a better sexual partner." It can be hard not to criticize yourself for any number of things that are outside of your control, especially your sexuality.

At the end of the day, though, I just have to accept myself for who I am. I can't change myself and become allosexual just by wishing it, and getting to preoccupied with "if only"s only causes you more stress. So I try my best to just be happy with the way I am. 




 Well, first I just wanna say that you've been through a really rough time and that sucks. I'm a panromantic asexual (ugh trying to explain that is so ridiculous). I'm female-bodied and identify as a woman, although I also frequently cross-dress, have a lot of "masculine" traits, and people usually assume I'm a butch lesbian. I've never had body-related dysphoria, but I have felt some dysphoria about wearing female clothes or makeup - I'm always uncomfortable, and I feel like I'm wearing a costume, not being myself. So I can certainly relate to a lot of what you're going through.

Secondly, liking someone who is queer doesn't make you not straight. My SO is hetero, dating a queer woman doesn't suddenly make him queer too. That is a really terrible excuse to break up with someone.

After having multiple people break up with you over this, all I can do is offer you my deepest sympathies. I know that it seems like you'll never find someone to accept you, but at the very least you don't make me uncomfortable and I won't judge you, and there's plenty of other nice internet folks out there who feel the same. It might help if you find a few friends that accept you, even if you can't find a partner right now.

I recently participated in an LGBT therapy group. We had a good mix of genders and orientations. Together we all were able to work out some of our anxieties, and it really helped all of us to know that there were other people struggling just like we were. If you can find a similar therapy or support group in your area, I would highly recommend trying to attend.

Finally, I just want to affirm that *you are not a freak*. There is nothing wrong with your orientation or gender being what it is. There are plenty of people out there just like you. Calling yourself a freak is an insult to all the awesome pan and trans* people out there! I know when you're depressed it's really hard to push away ugly thoughts like that, but I really hope that you can learn to deal with them and they won't take over.

Well I've rambled on long enough, but I hope that what I've said can help you, even if it's just a teeny bit. Feel free to PM me anytime if you just need someone to listen. You're not alone, okay? 




 It seems like you kinda answered your own question. "This is frustrating!!" After all, that's what most people really mean to say when they shout "that's so gay" while gaming. 




 Too bad Sherlock is also full of blatant gay-bating. :/ 




 Well, there are a lot of shows that you can make the case for a character being asexual (Sherlock, The Big Bang Theory, Community, etc.) but the main problem is that none of them openly identify as asexual and many of those same characters are also written as if they have some form of mental illness (Sherlock is bipolar, the rest are usually some form of autistic). 




 I would probably be a lot more excited about this if it weren't so cheesy ... /forever writing snob/ 




 Never read the comments. NEVER READ THE COMMENTS 




 And by "friend" you mean "asshole that is no longer a friend," yes? 




 This was basically my first poly experience in a nutshell. My SO started dating a woman who was already seeing two other guys, and the rest of them all treated me kind of shitty because the group dynamic centered around her, and since I wasn't dating her I was seen as an outlier, and therefore my feelings or opinions had the lowest priority. 




 First, yes, demisexual is a real thing. I'm ace, I know a lot of demis. Just throwing that out there.

But on to the poly stuff. I'm just not a jealous person, but rather extremely pragmatic, so I've never had an issue with that aspect. I do, however, take issue with deception or breaking boundaries. I think it really helps if you and your SO keep up constant, open, and honest communication. You should probably talk to him about your jealousy. Even if you don't want him to stop dating other people, he still might be able to help you work through some of that.

Also, speaking as someone who isn't sexual but also has a male allosexual (non-ace/gray/demi) partner, I can relate to the idea that you aren't going to be getting a lot of the same things out of poly. But that's okay. Instead of focusing on what he's getting that you're not, try thinking about what you *are* getting out of this relationship setup. For one thing, if you don't really enjoy sex that much (believe me, I can relate) then the fact that your SO can pursue sex with others takes some of the pressure off of you to perform sexually. This is actually the best benefit for me with my own relationship. Also, just as sexual feelings aren't limited in poly, romantic feelings aren't limited either. It doesn't really matter if you get attached to another partner in a way that your SO doesn't with his partners. Even if he only views you as a "serious romantic relationship" partner and all the others are "casual sexual relationship" partners, that has no relation to how you might feel about other partners. You don't have to do poly his way, find a way to do poly YOUR way.

Now for some dos and don'ts:

* DO set clear boundaries. If there are things that make either of you uncomfortable, you should voice them. Don't try to drop hints or beat around the bush and hope the other person catches on. Not setting up boundaries and sticking by them can lead to someone walking all over you or taking advantage of the gray area and hurting you. This is what nearly destroyed my relationship with my SO the first time he found a paramour - I didn't set clear boundaries, so he assumed certain things were okay that were definitely not okay.
* DON'T punish someone simply for having feelings. To me, one of the greatest benefits of poly relationships would be that it gives people the chance to explore their desires without fear of condemnation or negative repercussions on their current relationship. So if either of you develop feelings (romantic, sexual, whatever) for someone else, you can safely explore that without losing what you already have. Just remember that actions and feelings aren't the same, and that you generally can't change the way you feel about things just by wishing it, so there's no point in vilifying someone over it - this will only lead to resentment on both sides.
* DO communicate often. I can't stress this enough. You really need to talk to your partner. Good communication helps in any relationship, but it will especially save you a lot of headache with poly relationships. Just be honest with each other.
* DON'T be afraid to stand up for yourself. You don't have to be a martyr for your partner's sake. Doing things for your partner is of course part of being in a relationship, but don't neglect your own needs for "the good of the relationship." In a good relationship, your partner should be taking care of you, too. It's okay to be selfish every once in a while. The key is striking a balance between the two.

Okay, I've rambled on enough. I hope all this helps, feel free to comment or message me if you have any other questions or just wanna talk : 




 It's also really weird tho because a lot of the sweeter ones then say something casually that's super racist and then you just feel awkward; on the one hand they seemed really nice but on the other hand holy fuck that's racist. 




 Since other people already answered, I just wanted to say I hope you enjoy them both! Analogue really got to me, and Hate Plus was probably one of the better follow-ups to any VN I've read that wasn't originally written with a sequel in mind. 




 I'm happy that a lot of people are starting to recognize that fat-shaming is wrong, but it's really sad that as an unintended side-effect people have also started thin-shaming more and more. Any sort of body-shaming is not okay. It would be better if people could just keep their stupid comments to themselves. : 




 Ugh. So much ugh. I feel like I can relate, being asexual myself. It really sucks whenever guys decide to be total assholes just because you're not interested. Also, toxic people are awful. I would seriously consider trying to get that restraining order. Even if you don't think it will happen, it's worth a shot, especially since this guy is trying to get into all sorts of personal stuff about you. Stay safe, and good luck. 




 Yup. 




 That's awesome! Yay for good friends :D 




 I'm a senior (21, F) in college, have been with my SO (21, M) for over five years now. We both like anime, so whenever we went off to college together it seemed only natural that we both join our university's anime club. We hoped that we would meet some new friends and share our hobby with others; however, there has also been a lot of drama in this club, and just recently we were also sucked into it.

It all started about a month ago. A local theater was playing the latest Evangelion movie for a special midnight showing, and the club secretary posted on the club's facebook page that if anyone wanted to go, the club would cover the cost of their ticket - all anyone had to do was respond to the post and they would purchase their ticket for them. I couldn't go, but my SO thought it sounded like fun so he told the club president he wanted a ticket. President responded that they had a ticket for him, so he made arrangements with a friend to drive over together and everything was set. Or so he thought.

When my SO got to the theater with his friend, about 15 minutes before the movie, he found the club officers and they told him that they sold his ticket back. Of course, my SO was confused, because they had told him just the day before they had a ticket for him. But apparently, they had posted on facebook earlier that day that he had to reconfirm whether or not he was going. Since my SO doesn't live on facebook, he missed the message, and they sold back his ticket. The show was already sold out, so my SO didn't get to go and he and his friend both left.

Later he checked facebook and found the post they were referring to. In a comment at 8:41 PM, president had posted that if SO didn't respond he was giving away his ticket. For a show that night at 12. Seem a little unreasonable? My SO thought so, and responded in kind. Then the club secretary decided to rail on him, saying he was a dipshit, irresponsible, lazy, a dumbass, he's whining like a bitch, and that if he had merely texted the president this wouldn't have happened. My SO doesn't have the president's cell phone number, but the secretary did have my SO's, and by his own argument they could have just as easily contacted him. So despite secretary's long, swear-filled tirade, my SO politely informed him that perhaps they should all communicate better in the future, and that although secretary had the right to say whatever he liked, it really didn't look that good having an officer cussing out a club member on the club's public facebook page.

The club officers apparently didn't like this. President made a post (which was afterward deleted) saying that both my SO and secretary's behavior were unacceptable, and since it was everyone's club they would vote on what to do at the beginning of next meeting. SO had work, so he told the president he couldn't make it but would go along with whatever the club decided. Not that he should have bothered, since it was never brought up in meeting. The officers decided among themselves that they were just going to ban my SO, despite the fact that there was nothing in the club rules saying they could. They claimed he was banned for "disruptive behavior" because he made a scene at the movie theater, which he didn't, because my SO is probably the most shy, non-confrontational man on earth. Even then, though, his first "offense" should have only resulted in a warning - permanent bans are supposed to be given for a third offense. But they couldn't be bothered to follow their own rules and made up some bullshit, basically telling my SO that it didn't matter what he thought or wanted because they'd already decided he was out. My SO didn't have the time or energy to contest it with the school, so he let the issue drop.

I still thought the whole situation was frustrating and ridiculous, but I can't afford to make any waves on his behalf since I make a little money by selling handicrafts at local conventions. Two of the major conventions I sell at are also partly run by - you guessed it - club officers. Specifically, president and secretary. And I know that if I try to protest they'll likely find a similar excuse to ban me from their cons. Instead, I just stopped going to club.

To top it all off, one of the people I was friendly with at club who happens to work with my roommate told roomie that the officers have been gossiping about SO and me. As I suspected, they used a flimsy excuse to ban him because they don't like him. But it gets worse. According to the coworker, after club they were badmouthing both he and I at length, saying that because I'm such a feminist killjoy there's no way I'd put out for anyone, so my SO must be raping me. WTF?? Coworker told them that they went over the line, but they just ignored her and kept talking about us. I guess I shouldn't be surprised because I'm a queer woman and they've said some homophobic and sexist stuff before, but I honestly thought that we all got along well enough. That's what I get for hoping, I guess.

**TL;DR - The officers from our uni's anime club banned my SO on some bullshit pretense because they're sexist, homophobic jerks and the club is ruled by cronyism.** 




 Imho, playing the Sims without cheating is way too boring. 




 Oh wow, totally forgot about Perfect Blue. Shame on me! Lol.

In the Disney movie, Frollo really comes off as all yan and no dere, imho. 




 I haven't seen any. Then again I haven't seen many yandere in general. 




 I actually really like Sherlock and Light, though. I think part of the problem might be because women are often portrayed as overly emotional and way too needy, not to mention that women are often more likely to be diagnosed with various mental disorders, and the yandere subtype tends to feed into those negative stereotypes and perceptions. So seeing a character like Yuno that's just outright psychotic gives me a sort of icky feeling. She does, however, fit in really well with the tone of the series, so while I don't personally like her I do see why she was important to the plot. 




 I've always been weirded out by Yuno, but I appreciate her as a sort of antagonist I guess?

The rest I've never seen/read, except for Ranma, but I never finished that series so I guess I never got to that part, haha. 




 Honestly, if the character showed signs of improvement I would probably like them more. For instance, if they were super obsessive but you later learned about their back story and it provided a good reason (someone close to them died, or maybe they were abandoned?), and then as you develop the relationship they start to get better, I would probably enjoy that. Just like with tsundere - one of my favorite tsundere characters is probably Taiga from Toradora!, because as you learn more about her back story she's actually a really complex character and she grows and develops throughout the series. In general, I really just prefer characters that grow as time goes on, so if a yandere character were able to grow somewhat I'd probably like them. 




 No, orientation is not a choice. However, I personally take issue with the whole idea of the "born this way" or "it's biology" arguments. Of course it's highly possible that genetics plays a role, and there are probably environmental factors as well, just like with any other human condition. For instance, how do you know if someone will be an Olympic athlete? Part of it is probably good genes for whatever sport they end up in, but it also involves a lot of training. And of course, someone has the choice of whether or not they will act upon their orientation; some people try to resist their desires, because they wish to remain celibate, are closeted, etc.

To me, the whole debate about whether or not being gay (or any other form of GSRM) is a choice is moot. It really shouldn't matter if you choose to be gay or not. People should never be discriminated against because of their orientation, but rather free to explore their feelings for others without prejudice. Even if it was a choice, people should still be allowed to make that choice. If you ask me, as a U.S. citizen, I believe that our Constitution and laws are meant to protect peoples' freedoms, and if being gay were hypothetically a choice, the law should also protect that choice. After all, the law protects peoples' religion, and even though you have the ability to choose which religion (if any) to follow, many people consider their religion a core part of their identity, and people definitely shouldn't be discriminated against because of their religion. So why is not okay to discriminate against people for their religious choice, but it is okay to discriminate against people for their (perceived) orientation choice? 




 Well of course it eventually boils down to personal taste, but I just couldn't personally think of any (I haven't read or watched that many things with yandere characters to be honest).

I forgot about School Days, I started playing it but it ended up on the back burner so I never got that far in. Also, I thought Rena was more strictly a yangire? But I think Shion does count, now that you mention it.

All of the rest I'm not as familiar with, but I will check them out. My biggest issue is that the whole yandere archetype is based entirely upon the fact that the character is a stalker and likely crazy. It sets things up for an unhealthy relationship, which can be really problematic, but if it were written well I'd most likely be fine with it. 




 I was playing through Grisaia and since there is a bit of discussion in the game as to which type of -dere some of the characters are, it got me thinking. There are plenty of tsundere, kuudere, etc. characters that a lot of people seem to like, but I can't really think of any yandere characters from games or shows that I could say are likeable or genuinely popular. Can anyone else think of some? 




 Yes. The only problem was that the guy who fell for me was a total asshole, so there was actually no chance in hell that I would ever reciprocate and make his life actually better. 




 Like the others said, it would definitely dull your scissors. Not to mention I'm pretty sure that trying to cut leather (especially thick leather) with fabric scissors would be about as effective as trying to cut construction paper with safety scissors. It ain't gonna happen. You should definitely get some sort of specialized cutting implement. 




 I'll second this. There are plenty of poly people on OKC, and they have specific questions about non-monogamy (i.e., would you ever consider dating someone who was already in a relationship) so you can find out just from reading their profile if they'd be willing to try it out. Plus you can set your search options to "girls looking for girls." 




 I really liked The Royal Trap and The Second Reproduction, but [here's a list](http://visualnovelaer.fuwanovel.org/2013/07/list-of-all-english-and-english-translated-otome-games-via-otome-hearts/) of more otome (girl protag) games. 




 Yeah. I'm sure it's actually really common (especially if you're poly). Right now I'm in a committed relationship with my SO whom I've been dating for over five years, but I also have feelings for a girl I've been friends with since high school. 




 No problem, happy to help. Good luck! 




 I dunno, I think it would be okay if my SO already knew what he wanted to get in general but consulted the metamour for specifics. Like if he wanted to get me lingerie but wasn't sure on sizing for something and asked her for help. Basically, if he put the thought into it and knows in general what I like but she has more experience using something it would be okay. I've done the same thing for gifts I've gotten in the past - for instance, if I want to buy him electronics I'll often ask his dad or brother to help me narrow things down because they know more about electronics than I do and they know what would work best for how he wants to use it.

However, if he just asked her to pick something of course it would be cheating lol :P 




 Hmm. This one is a little tough. On the one hand, you and C seemed to have had mutual feelings at one point, meaning that there was (and might still be) a good chance of you getting together. On the other hand, C seems to have suddenly changed his mind. I would certainly want an explanation if I were you, so that I could figure out where to go from here - should you keep pursuing things or move on? Without more info, it's hard to tell.

Although H asking him about it may be able to get you this info, it's not necessarily likely. He might tell her the reasons (if any) or he might not. And it's possible that even if he does tell her that she will be sworn to secrecy and can't tell you. Although it might take more courage and seem a little riskier, it could be better for your to just ask C about it yourself.

Does C know about your feelings? Even if he was told indirectly through H, you should probably work up the nerve and tell him about it yourself. I would try to arrange some time where the two of you can talk face-to-face if possible so that you can tell him you like him and ask if there was any particular reason why he no longer reciprocates, as H seemed to think that he was into you too. Honesty and frankness can go a long way in these sorts of situations.

Perhaps C is worried about being in a queer relationship? I assume that this would be the case if you did get together since you're posting this in /r/askGSM. In that case, it's possible that he still does have feelings for you but is worried about the social implications of being with you. Or perhaps he's just nervous about being in a new relationship in general.

Of course it's also possible that he thought he had feelings for you but those have faded, or he's just too busy, or changed his mind, or whatever other reason people stop liking each other. But you'll never know until you talk to him about it. So I would suggest that you do that, and then go from there.

Let me know if you need any other advice, and you should update whenever you find out more : 




 The world we live in honestly sucks. I'm really sorry for what your friend went through, and I hope that your friend gets the support she needs, if not from the school or police than from friends and loved ones like you. I also hope nothing like that ever happens to her again. Abuse is really difficult to handle, and I know firsthand that it really sucks when everyone else tells you that you're making things up or blowing things out of proportion or it's really your fault.

I feel similar rage whenever I read internet comments on things like this. Sometimes I just wish that a meteor would hit every single asshole who's ever harassed an abuse or rape victim like this, but the universe is not that kind. 




 The above is only a few of the reasons I loathe the American education system. 




 Being pissed that someone gave you a disease is not slut shaming. Wanting your poly partner to practice safe sex is not slut shaming. Calling them a slut for wanting to have sex is slut shaming.

Your primary doesn't have a leg to stand on here. There is a difference between shaming women for their sexual desires and calling people out when they make bad decisions with objectively negative consequences. She has compromised not only her own health but your health, and of course you're allowed to be angry because of it. She's full of it, and honestly I would consider no longer being with this person. Clearly she doesn't seem to make your best interests a high priority. 




 Hmm. Probably not. I really like most of my guy friends, but they are not usually the guys that I would want to date, for various reasons. Thus why they are friends, and not people I'm asking out. There are maybe one or two guys I might consider going out with if they asked, but it's a pretty slim chance that a relationship would develop there. 




 If you no longer love your husband because he has substance abuse issues and is turning into someone who is scaring you, YOU ARE NOT A HORRIBLE PERSON. You are totally normal and justified in feeling that way. I'm sure he has his own issues, but that does not excuse any sort of violent or threatening behavior. Plus, can you really justify being with him for the sake of your kid? I'm willing to bet that being an addict severely compromises his ability to be a decent caregiver to your child.

My suggestion would be that your husband needs rehab (and also therapy). If he is totally unwilling to get help or change in any way, then you need to get out. Don't wait until it gets worse - cut ties now before something really bad happens. And you shouldn't have to give up on your bf at all - if he is supporting you in all this, I would say that you should definitely stay with him. He can probably help you with taking care of your son and anything else you need while the husband is in rehab or if you do decide to leave him.

That's what I would do, anyway. Whatever you decide to do, OP, I hope that things start to look up for you in the future. And just know that you shouldn't have to feel guilty for not loving someone who isn't there for you. 




 Agreed, to me ultimatums are a last resort only to be used when you reach your breaking point of things you are willing to tolerate. 




 No, I don't think that ultimatums are inherently manipulative. Most of the time when someone gives another person (especially their partner) an ultimatum, it tends to be because they have a really serious issue and they are tired of dealing with that person's shit. An ultimatum is less about making someone else doing what you want, and more an expression of "there is something seriously wrong here, and unless a big change happens soon this relationship will fail."

So at least imho giving an ultimatum is actually healthy for a relationship. It's a way for someone to express the problems they are having and making sure that those issues are seen as incredibly important by the other partner.

Of course, like everything else it has the potential to be misused - for instance, if someone says "if you don't propose to me within the year, we're done" but they've only been together for a month, that would be a little ridiculous. And I'm sure that in the past there have been people who have used it purely to manipulate others into doing what they want. However, in my experience an ultimatum is supposed to be a last resort. It's like having an intervention for your partner.

In that line of thought, ultimatums aren't exactly the same as having standards or "deal breakers," it's more of an expression of reaching a breaking point about what they are willing to tolerate. For instance, my parents got divorced a few years back. After talking to my mom about it, one of her standards would be that she wants someone who is emotionally supportive. A deal breaker for her in looking for a new relationship would have been anyone who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. Her previous husband (my stepdad) was neglectful and borderline emotionally abusive and he was definitely a functioning alcoholic, but she put up with these things for 13 years while they were married. She finally issued an ultimatum saying that if they didn't seek out some kind of counseling she would leave him. He didn't want to admit they had any problems and insisted that they didn't need counseling, so she left. Thankfully, now she is much happier and married to a new guy that has his shit together and takes care of her and my little sister. 

So I would say that issuing an ultimatum can definitely be justified, and no, just because you give someone an ultimatum doesn't mean you're trying to manipulate them. Sometimes it's genuinely because you want to help them, but if it gets to the point that you have to issue an ultimatum to your partner odds are there are a lot of issues there and at that point it's about as likely that you'll be able to fix the issues as it is that the relationship will fail. 




 Yeah, assuming that you like a good variety of games, there is always something free each month that you'll like. It basically pays for itself if you keep it around long enough and download enough of the free games. 




 I would definitely say it's been worth it for me. I'm a college student living with two other college students and none of us has a lot of money to spend on games, but PS+ has given us several good ones that we would otherwise never have.  




 He has lost some weight, which is good, but I'm pretty sure it mostly has to do with the fact that he's still in his mid-20s and can get away with eating unhealthy things because he still has a relatively high metabolism. But their dad has diabetes and the food he eats has barely any nutrients, and I'm just internally going "ugh" every time we go to eat somewhere because in another five or ten years he's going to start feeling the impact of his crappy diet. 




 Thanks. It's not really a full-on trigger for me, but I still am not at all OK with it. But I have talked to other people who it is a trigger for and I know how that shit feels so I really try hard not to violate anyone's personal space. :/ 




 I really liked that part too! It was certainly interesting. 




  I quite liked the mindfuck

Well I didn't really hate it, lol. I was just horribly confused. But as far as those sorts of scenes go it was nice ... ignoring all the plot holes and physics-defying, anyway, haha.

And yeah, everyone has their tastes. I understood the target demographic they were going for with Mink, I just personally couldn't relate because if it were me I'd be like, "Forget this guy." 




 DRAMAtical Murder isn't otome, but it is pretty good. Still worth a read in my opinion. I still haven't read Hatoful, my SO played it and he seemed to enjoy it but I just never got around to it. 




 Unfortunately, no, it's not. I've actually been wanting to make my own VNs for a long time just so I can add some diversity to the available market. But I'm a college student and I don't have a lot of free time for programming. 




 *Exactly* 




 I usually play the bad end first to get it out of the way. They're usually shorter, and it helps lessen the blow to my feels if I know that the character doesn't actually end up in whatever state of misery the bad ending puts them in.

Plus, it makes the triumph of the good endings seem so much better if you go through all the bad ones first! (see Higurashi) 




 Basically, yes. It's one of those things, at least imho. Honestly I probably would never have played through Higurashi if I hadn't seen the anime first and known that the writing was really good. 




 So, I'm not sure how popular this game is as I've never seen any online discussion of it, but I finally finished this VN and I wanted to see if anyone else has played it and how they interpret some of what's going on in the various routes and subplots.

Here are my impressions in no particular order:

* I'm a little tied between Koujaku and Clear as my favorite characters. I liked Koujaku almost despite myself. He's basically your archetypal heartthrob and the whole childhood-friends-becoming-something-more things is a little overused, but he was still a really interesting character. His Scrap scene was really intense. Also he had a really good voice actor, I think that helped a lot. Clear, on the other hand, was actually the first route I ended up on and I thought his character was also really likable and endearing. But his ending ... [](/s "the writers were pulling some real nekige bullshit there. I think they were actually challenging themselves to come up with the most depressing thing that can happen for this character. Right after proving how badass he is by stabbing his own brain and taking down the bad guy, he finally gets to be with the man he loves ... as he slowly dies and falls apart. I was cursing the game for making me cry during that scene.")

* I really don't understand the appeal of Mink, at all. [](/s "I get that they were going for a whole dom/sub relationship there, but honestly, it doesn't seem all that plausible to me that Aoba would want to seek him out again after defeating Toue considering Mink repeatedly raped him. Honestly, the only difference between what Mink was doing to Aoba versus what Trip and Virus do to him in one of the bad endings for the Ren route is that Mink is presented as a "good" guy. It seemed like they were trying to go for "yes he's a jerk sometimes but really he's understood you see because his whole family was murdered." I really don't like these types of characters, never understood why they are so popular. Having your whole family killed is bad, yes, but that doesn't justify going around raping people. Seriously.")

* Oh, and about that "true" route. [](/s "I was willing to let a lot of things slide in this game, but this is the point where I just threw my hands up and said, "WTF, Japan?" Aoba falling in love with his robot dog is one thing. I mean, it's not like the idea of love between humans and non-humans is new or totally taboo. It's in plenty of classic fairy tales like The Little Mermaid, or in modern fantasy like LotR or Eragon. I was totally willing to accept this at first. I just assumed that after the showdown with Toue, Aoba would build Ren a new, humanoid body or something. But then as the plot advanced further it was revealed that Ren is actually Aoba's split personality that somehow managed to gain an independent body. So instead of fucking a robot dog, he is now fucking the robot dog version of himself. I felt like this was stretching it, but even then I could have lived with the idea. But the thing that topped it all off was the good ending, how Sei supposedly dies and gives Ren his body. First of all, I'm not entirely sure how this is even physically possible. They never explain how Sei survived the tower collapse, nor how Ren is able to keep living on in his body even though Sei himself said that his heart was failing. Unless he was talking about his heart failing in a metaphorical sense? But I digress. Now on top of fucking his robot-dog-self, we are supposed to believe that Aoba will continue to have a relationship with his robot-dog-self inside his twin brother's body. Like, how on earth does he explain this to people considering the fact that everyone at the hospital has identified him as Sei? He is officially on record as Sei, not Ren. Does he just come home to everyone and go, "now I know that you all think this guy is my long lost twin brother, but really he's Ren, my Allmate, in a human body. Also, Ren and I are technically the same person. But don't mind us, we're just gonna go off and live happily ever after now." I really don't see that as possible.")

Well, enough ranting on my part. Despite my complaints, the game was really well made and I actually did enjoy it. I'm not sure if the "true" route is really worth pursuing, but the main four routes are all much better. Honestly, anyone will probably find something they like in one of the characters, and I really enjoyed playing through it.

TL;DR - too many spoilers to give an accurate summary, sorry :/ 




 Also from the South, and I've kinda given up on being irritated with this because it is so common here. Most people just say it on instinct. That I usually let slide because it takes too much energy to fight it. But it still really irks me when people call me "sweetie" or "sweetheart" in a patronizing way. That is definitely not cool. 




 As a fellow southerner I'd say this is pretty common. It still drives me crazy though. I've never been comfortable with people hugging me, so going to parties where I don't know a lot of people and suddenly everyone wants to hug ... bleh. 




 Ugh, I hate these things too. For one, I was abused for over half my childhood and I am always hyper-aware of people touching me. It makes me seriously uncomfortable. But even if I'd never been traumatized, it's still really stupid to violate people's boundaries like that.

Also, people touching my head without my permission is probably my single biggest pet peeve. I keep my hair cut really short and it's pretty fluffy (especially if it just dried) and so people just come up and touch it all the time and it drives me nuts. I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK MY HAIR LOOKS SO FLUFFY YOU WANT TO DIE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WALK UP AND MOLEST MY SCALP WITHOUT ASKING ME. 




 As someone who is a picky eater (mostly because of tactile sensitivities to textures) I try really hard not to be that stupid with food. I actually do try stuff occasionally, because you can't say that you don't like it if you've never tried it. And if I try it and end up not liking it I just say "no thanks, it's not for me" and then everyone can move on. There's no need to act all ridiculous about other people eating things I don't like - especially since they could just as easily turn it around and criticize me for not liking things that they enjoy eating.

So yeah, when I meet other picky people that refuse to even try shit before going on and on about how they don't like it and then get all dramatic when you force them to try new things, it drives me nuts. For instance, my SO's older brother is literally the pickiest person I've met. His diet consists pretty much entirely of chocolate pop-tarts, chicken nuggets, plain cheeseburgers (and he only recently started adding cheese), french fries, and gold fish crackers. He irritates me so much because he absolutely refuses to even taste new things 99.999% of the time. But he's trying to be healthier and lose weight. I just want to scream at him that if you don't try to change then nothing will change, but everyone else in their family just makes excuses for him and enables him and I can't stand it. 




 No, they don't have to be exactly the same. After all, if we tried to put everything to a standard of being exactly the same we wouldn't even have common experiences between individual queer people, even those of the same orientation and identity and race and social class and religion and everything else. Because all human beings are different to some degree and have different experiences to some degree.

I feel like the comparison between certain specific things like you mentioned is a lot more valid, like the fact that interracial marriage wasn't acceptable but is now, so why can't same-sex marriage? That's a relatively equivalent comparison. But not comparing the entire queer experience to the entire black (or other person of color) experience, because once again this ignores intersectionality and how people who face multiple systems of oppression are going to have their own set of unique issues. 




 Clearly you don't understand how sexism works, and I really fail to see how anything you say is still relevant to the discussion at hand. 




 The only thing you will learn from whether your son likes trucks or Barbies is which toy he'd like to play with at that particular moment. 




 Good on you for getting far away from that crazy. It sucks that you have to lose such a close friend, but friends like that probably aren't worth having. 




 human semen contains prostaglandins, which are responsible for cervical ripening

That was the part I was talking about. That part doesn't seem to be in question. And in my summary I did say that it MIGHT help induce labor, not that it definitely did. I didn't really find all of the breast stimulation stuff relevant to the discussion at hand. 




 Biologically, yes, parts of my body are capable of bearing children. But that is not the entirety of my being or existence. Just like how yours isn't to go around impregnating women 24/7. One of the benefits of living in social groups is that people have a lot more things to do than than eat, sleep, fuck. 




 From my experience, people are willing to pay a little more for something that's personal or unique for them. So that line of thinking isn't bad by any means. 




 Technically, no, attraction alone shouldn't be a crime. However, molesting or raping children is a crime. Comparing being gay to pedophilia or bestiality is flawed. Many religious people have made this comparison to say that all of these behaviors are morally wrong, but children and animals are incapable of giving consent to sexual acts. Adult human beings can. Thus, two adult people of the same gender having consenting sex is not comparable to an adult that engages in sex acts with children. 




 Oh, okay, that makes more sense. I hope they enjoy their gifts! 




 I would hope so! Seriously, just because it isn't sexual doesn't make it less awkward or creepy!! 




 Although the comparison to pedophilia is obviously flawed and once again tolerance does not mean allowing hate speech, this guy's song did raise one good point - people really shouldn't compare the struggle that GSRM people go through for rights to the struggle that racial minorities go through for rights so flippantly. Yes, both groups have been oppressed, but not always in the same ways, and they are not the exact same thing. Not to mention that saying "gay is the new black" basically erases all the struggles that queer people of color go through. 




 Actually, having sex with fluid contact during pregnancy can be healthy - semen can soften the cervix, which is important because it reduces the risk of complications during birth. It might also help to induce labor, if necessary.

That said, if the idea makes you uncomfortable you shouldn't have to do it, and especially considering how it might impact a fetus you should make sure that you, your girlfriend, and the other couple all get screened for STDs. 




 But the Tagalongs are objectively better. 




 I'm a little confused. You said they were for Gryffindor, but the pictures look like you used purple and yellow yarn but Gryffindor colors are red and purple. Is it just bad lighting in the photos? Also I have no idea what the snake has to do with Gryffindor in particular as it's the symbol for Slytherin House. 




 Definitely! Randomly touching people is just not okay, period - it doesn't matter what gender or sexuality anyone is. 




 A lot of gay guys I've met (or that my friends have had run-ins with) basically assume that they're allowed to critique women's bodies as much as they want, or grope women whenever they feel like, because "relax, I'm gay! I'm not a threat because I don't want to sleep with you."

I guess a lot of them don't realize that just because they aren't attracted to women doesn't mean that they aren't potentially threatening. After all, rape and sexual assault isn't about attraction, it's about power. I'm glad that you realize that even a gay man still has some power over a woman. 




 In society women are treated as if their only important functions are to be a sex object or bear children. Otherwise, we don't matter. Just because a guy isn't attracted to women doesn't mean he thinks any better of them than a straight man.

Fortunately, though, at least some of them seem to be cluing into this and I've seen a lot of gay men speaking up about their own misogyny and how to end it. 




 Generally I try to come up with my own patterns for things. Sometimes I'll have close friends say "I found this pattern, will you make it for me?" and I'll only charge them a little extra plus materials cost, but I also sell online and at conventions. On my Etsy shop and at cons I won't sell something made from a pattern unless I get permission from whoever made the pattern. A lot of times in the pattern copyright the original creator will specify whether or not it's okay to sell finished pieces made from their patterns.

As far as photos taken from things you make, even if you didn't design the pattern, I'd say that's okay. It's like building a portfolio - you're showing off your skill and technique. To make a comparison, photographers make money selling their prints all the time, even if they didn't make the thing they're photographing (buildings, animals, etc.) because the part they're selling is the *photograph*, which takes skill and effort.

As far as pricing goes, for larger projects I usually charge by the week, medium projects by the day, and small projects by the hour. For instance, if I make an accessory that only takes about 2 hours to make, I'll charge around $15 (minimum wage where I live is about $7.50, I worked two hours on it, it's tiny enough that I don't care about materials). If it takes me a weekend to finish a scarf, I charge about $25 (estimating $5 for yarn and $10 for each day). If it's a bigger project like the pillows or bags I've made, I'll charge about $10 per week plus materials.

It's basically a sliding scale. I still want to make money for all the effort I put into something, but I also want to keep it from becoming so ridiculously expensive that no one will buy it. For instance, I once made someone a sweater for a costume. I probably put 70+ hours into that sweater. But I wasn't about to charge them per hour, as that would have become a $500 sweater. No one will pay that. 




 Honestly, I'd agree with the whole sentiment of "only they are responsible for what happens between the two of them." This girl's boyfriend does not own her - she is capable of making her own decisions about who she wants to be with. If he can't handle that, then perhaps they aren't meant to be together. But that's up to the two of them.

You are totally separate from them. What you do with this girl is not up to the boyfriend, it's up to you and her. Of course there are potential consequences for anything you do, but it seems to me like you're coming at this from the perspective of "If I act on my feelings for her and she and her boyfriend break up, it will be my fault." In reality, if she is poly and her boyfriend is mono, that mismatch will be why they break up, not necessarily because of anything in particular you do. Some people just aren't sexually or romantically compatible.

To look at it a different way, imagine if there was a man and a woman who were together, but the man realized at some point he was gay and although he certainly cared for his female partner, he realized he would much rather be with another man he had connected with. Would it be the second man's fault if the first man and the woman broke up? No, it would merely be an unhappy circumstance. People can't control their sexuality or who they fall in love with, so if this girl you like and her bf end up separating that's not on you, it's just an unhappy circumstance. 




 If you want to, and you feel comfortable enough, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't come out to your mom. It seems like a pretty good time, if she's already asking you questions about your orientation.

The best way I've found to do it is to just automatically take people to a website like the AVEN FAQs or the Huff Post series on asexuality, since practically no one knows what asexuality even is. It really helps if you have an official(ish) definition and more formal explanations about how this stuff works because people are less likely to brush you off as being confused or making it up to feel special or some other bullshit. Also, answering the same questions over and over gets pretty tiring so it's usually a lot better if they can get background info first and then ask you more specific questions. 




 Speaking as someone who's mom just recently got remarried, I know why you would definitely worry about your kids. I'm 21, but I'm the oldest out of three - my youngest sibling is 12. So far though, neither myself nor my sister has had any problems. My brother (17) has, but he's got problems with everyone in general so that wasn't surprising.

But I digress. What I'm trying to get at is that you'd be surprised how easily kids acclimate to this sort of thing. Assuming that everyone's kids likes all the other parents and kids, this sort of thing really shouldn't be that hard. It won't be much different than my situation. I have three dads now, basically, it's just that my mom is only currently with one of them. If she decided to get back together with either my previous stepdad or my actual dad, the only thing that would change is I wouldn't have to make three trips if I wanted to see everyone.

Basically as long as it won't cause any legal issues as far as custody of your kids, I wouldn't worry too much about this. Kids are really flexible, and it's not like they'll lose out on attention if they suddenly gained two more parents. They'll probably enjoy it. But you should certainly talk to them about it at some point.

Edit: wrote down the wrong age for my brother, I can't math today 




 Wow, that is kind of a shitty situation. And you're right, it's not really anyone's fault, it just sorta happened.

If it were me I probably wouldn't tell Ann just because if she doesn't really need to know I can't see a reason to make her upset too. But other than that I would definitely try to just move on and do better next time. It seems like Beth understands that you wouldn't purposefully do something that would make her uncomfortable and you wouldn't have done it had you known she was awake. So yeah, icky feelings and all that but you can't change the past, you can only try to do better and not make the same mistake again in the future.

My suggestion would be that if you are going to have Ann over again would be to perhaps find a way for Beth to stay somewhere else (go visit a friend or family maybe) or perhaps invest in a pair of ear plugs. 




 To be fair though, it's still pretty shitty to tell someone that's bisexual that they can't be bisexual because they're actually a confused gay or straight person. It's ok to be confused, and it's ok to be flexible. But you should never tell someone their identity can't exist because it doesn't fit into a neat little box. 




 There is a lot in that series that can be horrifically taken out of context, tbh. 




 I understand genderbinary stuff, what I never could understand though is how people also assume that you can only be straight or gay and there is no wiggle room. There have been queer people since ancient times who were accepted by the society they lived in as normal. Yet somehow people seem to have forgotten that. Even in modern science, though, the last fifty or sixty years of psychological research has been full of examples of studies showing the range of human sexuality. So why do people still assume otherwise? It makes no sense to me. :/ 




 I would say that there isn't really a problem with you attending clubs or events as an ally. You mentioned that you got involved with a friend of yours who is trans - I'm sure that person really appreciates that they have an awesome friend who will support them with this stuff.

To me it sounds like you're an average straight guy who is really comfortable with himself, as well as other people who are different from you, and that's not a bad thing by any means. I've had a lot of friends in the past who said that they were accepting of the fact that I'm queer, but they never really want to go to events with me or talk about it or probably even think about it. They accept my personality, but really my identity and community makes them uncomfortable. I'd be quicker to call those people phony than you.

As long as you don't try to claim you're something you're not, or go to events that are meant to be safe spaces for queer people only (support groups, for example), or try to assert your thoughts or opinions as more important than the queer people around you, there's no reason why you shouldn't help out and support them. 




 I feel you, teenage years are rough. I never came out to most of the people I knew in school, and didn't have much internet access either so I didn't really find out about other asexual people until I was already your ate. It sucks. Also, once again proof to all the nay-sayers about how "gay people have it worse because at least if your asexual none of the religious people are going to tell you you're going to hell." Yeah, right.

The good news is, pretty soon you'll be a legal adult and you can go away for college or find a job in another town and start over with your life away from all those assholes. 




 Whenever I first saw it this is basically what I thought. My interpretation was that she was genuinely startled by that guy and didn't really mean to kill him but considering she just found a pillow full of the hair from one of her father's victims it's totally understandable that she would freak out and kill someone who snuck up on her while she was horrified and hyperaware.

Although I interpreted what Hannibal said to her as "This looks really bad and people are going to assume you murdered him" more than "You just murdered him." Of course, it's been a while since I haven't rewatched since it aired. What Hannibal said actually made a lot of sense and he was probably right - a jury would have a hard time believing that Abigail didn't mean to kill him, especially considering her dad was a serial killer and the guy was harassing her and her friend earlier. However, he was also definitely using the situation to his advantage so that he could further manipulate and isolate Abigail. 




 I frequently buy ICEEs when going to a movie in the middle of winter. I have never once gotten sick. That's like saying you'll catch a cold if you go out while your hair is wet. Pretty sure there is no hazard since *you're in a warm building while drinking it.* 




 I can say that after playing like 20+ hours of Sherlock Holmes games these last few days that I definitely appreciate this. 




 I will admit that I often get confused by riddles. Lol 

Honestly though I don't know why so many people assume that if you're bi/pan you must just be confused or still in the "questioning" phase. Sure, there are probably lots of people who are confused about their sexuality but there are more than two orientations . 




 I don't know how soon you plan on having the surgery, but if it won't be for a few months you should probably find a psychologist who is trained in  exposure therapy and have them help her out. It's a really effective treatment for things like phobias or OCD. It would probably help her freak out less because she can work her way up to it rather than going from totally fine to nightmare mode right away. 




 Yeah, that sounds about right. 




 Well I thought I made that clear in my initial comment, but I guess not. But essentially yes, he was being an ass about it. I tried to simplify the story for the sake of space but I suppose that was a bad move on my part. If it helps, he also tried to insinuate that my not liking his "joke" was because I was PMSing, so yeah I think it's safe to say he was in the wrong. 




 I legit asked my SO to buy me a ring like [this one](http://www.titanium-buzz.com/piston-wedding-ring.html?productid=piston-wedding-ring channelid=FROOG utm_source=CSEs utm_medium=GoogleShopping utm_campaign=TitaniumBuzzCSE). He wouldn't go for it. 









 My main expectation across the board is that my partner doesn't try to pressure me or guilt trip me into having sex. I'm asexual; not only do I have a complete lack of sex drive, but I also take quite a while to get comfortable enough with a person that I would be willing to have sex with them for their pleasure.

Other than that, I really prefer that the person is honest with me about STD risk, that we always use some form of protection, and that they are willing to communicate freely about what they want from the relationship as far as preferences or potentially other partners. 




 Sure, I wouldn't mind. It doesn't bother me at all. I know that a lot of women (from what they've told me) sometimes feel insecure dating bi guys because they don't just have to worry about women potentially "stealing their man," but they have to worry about him leaving her for a man as well.

Really though, I've never been a jealous person and it's never been an issue for me. Plus it would be rather hypocritical of me to forgo dating a bi man since I'm panromantic.  




 Also, speaking as someone who lives in the U.S. South, the term has a different meaning here ...
