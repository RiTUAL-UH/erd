 AWD = all wheel drive, which is all the wheels turning at the same time.  They're all driven off the same engine and same
 transfer case.  Now that you know that, here is the second part...  Different sized tires on one car, have to spin at different RPM's in order to turn at the same speed.  Add those together and you have a problem for transfer cases. 




 Ironic that it wasn't eating...  seems like he was playing the long game to get a taste of human.  




 Doesn't matter, got arm back.  




 That, actually makes a lot of sense.  




 It being made by EA. 




 I don't know how to do a spoiler tag.  But you can't believe everything to hear or read.  




 You shut your dirty mouth, with that jumped the shark nonsense!  




 Please explain this guys problem then... 




 I had an argument with someone on here, and they swore there was noting in meth that harms you or destroys teeth, that it was poor hygiene.   Some people are idiots.    




 I don't care how much EA sucks, I'm going to give them my money!  




 I wouldn't go.  




 The rich hide and move their money to avoid this tax anyways. That's what trust funds and lots of foundations are all about.  Now they don't have to do this.  If this hurts anyone, it's going to hurt all the tax and estate lawyers. 




 Yeah, I would now encourage my kids to make as much noise as possible, and save that letter to show the police when they show up. I would then ask them to file a harassment charge on said "neighbor".  God save said person if they decided to not call the police and try to confront my kids themselves.  I'll be the first one to give someone a dirty look if their kids are acting up in public when it's not appropriate, but I'll be dead in the grave before someone tells me how to act in my own god dammed yard!  




 I would go outside and make as much noise as possible, during daylight hours.  Fuck that person.  




 Then why doesn't it dissolve sugar?  




 So gas will dissolve Styrofoam, but not sugar?  




 If you don't mind, I'm just gong to slowly masterbate.  




 Fall out, i killed everyone.  




 Third time?  Filthy casual.   




 I don't start shit, but if you hit me, I'm going to finish it. Period. 




 How about you just move over to the right?  




 This cop would of be justified in shooting that uppity bitch.  




 Las Vegas.  Hover damn will give us easy power.  




 Better question, why do you walk so slow and in my way?  Make way for the tallest, peasants!  




 I remember when this was a thing.  




 No mention of Dag's?  




 I've always thought that people that get drugged are completely out of it.  As in, she wouldn't of gotten into her vehicle and gotten in the freeway.  




 Even if she wasn't drunk or on illegal drugs, it is illegal it sleep in the middle of the freeway then refuse a police order to "stop". 




 I pick a different spot  




 Photoshop or perspective?  




 How does he think his "zero emission" vehicles get recharged?  Most of the power in America comes from coal fired plants.  




 Be more confident, pick up on the signs from the girls, and have sex with them all.  




 You evil bastard.  




 Right or wrong, when a person with a gun tells you to "get down", you listen and show them your best dance moves.  Don't be shy, it could cost you your life.  




 Ok dude...  you're clearly a fucking jackass.  If you think meth isn't dangerous, and all the people dying from that shit is because they don't take care of themselves, then I'm not going to keep arguing.  Like I was told years ago, never argue with an idiot.  And I'll take all the down votes.  Clearly redit is a bunch of loopy liberals who will believe anything.  




 You smoked for a few years.  Good for you, you got lucky, so far.  I'll bet money that you'll have health problems in the future.   If you would of kept using, you would of developed issues.  I had a good friend who used for years.  He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.  Meth will destroy your internal organs too. Can't blame that on poor hygiene.   




 Are you an idiot or in denial?  Meth will eat away every part of your body that it touches.  Why do you think peoples teeth fall out? Why do you think doing meth for 10 years ages people 30+ years?  And don't give me any shit about how it's all the bad shit they put in meth to cut it.  There isn't really such a thing as pure meth that anyone on the street is going to find.  




 It has nothing to do with skin color, it's the culture.  




 You sure do have a lot of free time on your hands.  




 That girl looks a little young.  




 Who?  




 Three.  Shouldn't it be "an"?  




 The correct response "I'll fix it for free and give you money!" 




 Hornets and spiders 




 Friends come and go, doesn't matter, had sex.   




 Sorry, but that's not how it works.  Wing man breaks the ice.  If you can't close the deal or the female chooses the wing man, then you're SOL.  Try looking in the mirror before blaming others for your issues.  




 Any woman can get laid anytime they want. Just find a horny and desperate man.  

But can a woman land a guy that's better looking, with her personality, the way men can?  Usually not. 

But I've seen plenty of people hooking up at closing time, that would never be with said person in another situation.  Late night and alcohol can do wonders for everyone.  




 I'm only going to break the ice, if you can't close the deal, you don't need a wingman, you need a hooker.  




 Bull.  I'm not a pretty man, but I've had plenty of one night stands, where I get the girl with my humor and wit.  Make them laugh and your golden.  




 If you can't close the deal, why should he have to miss out on some strange? Grow a pair.  




 Are you God or the police? No.  Then get off your high horse and out of the left lane.  




 STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE THEN, NOT SORRY.  




 Ever consider not being in that lane in the first place.  You slow passive drives need to just say in the right lane.
