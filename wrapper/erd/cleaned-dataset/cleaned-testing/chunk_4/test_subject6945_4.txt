 The urge to kick one of those tables is overwhelming.  




 that photo was taken a few hours after the first, same thumb.  









 I don't get this "several times" buisness, are you suppose to last more than one or two pumps?  




 i know i may be a bit late to the party, but iv been wanting to try it for some time but no one can ever seem to get any. help a brother out? 




 Yes! I watched it for the First time last week and i can't get over it!  




 i thought he was having a stroke, but really determined to quench his thirst.   




 i am the husband-to-be! nah there was 10 people including the pilot, so its a bit of a tight fit but worth it!

 only one way to find out! 




 obviously they have never been to dandenong
