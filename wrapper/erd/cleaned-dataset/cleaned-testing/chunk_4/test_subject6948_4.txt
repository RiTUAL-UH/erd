 They fist bumped.  




 Homework always takes priority over Smash, that's the first thing I told him. :) I'll let him play for a while, and when I think it's time, that's when we'll get serious.  




 Indeed. We asked about just having 4 players vs. 4 CPUs, but she was instructed only to do normal Smash. 

Luckily, there was still a lot of fun to be had with normal 4-player. Wii Fit Trainer dittos and the Gamer stage were highlights.  




 Lucky. We weren't allowed to use 8-Player Smash at ours.  




 We'll be playing SSB4 together mostly every day for at least 2 months, so we'll likely be practicing a lot. I told him there's math behind the game as well, so he can use that as an excuse if he wants to.  




 So, just some quick background here:

I'm by no means the best player. I've played with competitive level players, and I'm always coming out in 2nd or worse. So, it's no big surprise I wasn't doing well. 

Then there's my brother, who's turning 10 a few days before SSB-Wii U drops. He's by all definitions a casual. He mostly spends time in Brawl spamming Toon Link's dair yelling "DUCKTALES!". So, he tagged along when I went to GameStop, hoping to try out the new game. 

There was a group of people that were competitive-level players who were trashing everyone, including me. So, my little brother secretly asks to use my controller so he can play against these guys, and I agreed. They never bothered to look at who was playing.

The two guys both chose Pit, and my brother the Villager. There was a Diddy Kong somewhere, but he died pretty early. Items on, 3 stocks, Palutena's Temple. 

Fast forward to near halfway through. Diddy's gone, and everyone has one stock. The Daybreak item begins to appear. One of the Pits manages to grab two, and the final piece spawns behind my brother. This is when I begin to watch him more carefully. He quickly plants a tree near the Daybreak, and one Pit doesn't see it. He rushes towards the piece, and then BAM. My brother finishes him off with a final blow using the tree. 

My brother pockets the piece and runs. The final Pit, with the other two pieces, begins to rush towards him. What I saw my brother do, this filthy casual who likes to spam attacks and then Kirbycide 90% of the time, really made me proud of him. 

He used Lloid Rocket to space himself decently from the player, and did nothing but constantly avoid the grasp of him by rocketing from one platform to the other, and sometimes using Balloon Fight. He planted trees to create walls in order to get some time. At one point, he landed on the bridge and destroyed it right as Pit landed on it using his Weed Pluck D-Tilt. He continually attacked using the slingshot, and managed to grab nearly every single  arrow this guy threw and shoot it right back. The guy was screaming "Get over here, stop running away! It's my Daybreak!" After managing to rack up enough damage, my brother stops on a platform. He doesn't plant anything, he doesn't do anything, he stands there with enough damage that a good aerial from Pit would kill him. 

The Pit rushed towards him. The platform rose above the ground, and the guy cockily laughs as he jumps onto the platform and stands there. My brother begins to dance. Pit started up the Upperdash Arm, and just as the dance ended, my brother rolled for the first time in history, and then used the twirling stick U-Tilt to land a finishing blow on this guy. 

The player looked at me, and stuck his hand out as a "good game" kind of thing. I told him it wasn't me playing, and my brother grinned ear to ear and started laughing.

This is the kind of stuff I really enjoy seeing. He's never been this excited about a match before, and suddenly he picks up on some techniques he's never used before, and uses them to win against two competitive players. I've started calling him Decky the Destroyer, and he's enjoying every moment of it. 

I really do hope we can see this kind of stuff pop up in the future.  




 Isn't the screwdriver the same one Blendin takes in the Time Traveler's Pig? My only question is why that specific date was needed to take the screwdriver.  




 Well, my personal idea...

**King K. Rool**

N-Special: Bunderbuss. He pulls out his blunderbuss and fires a cannonball. Comparable to Bowser Junior's N-Special. A character can kick it in any direction assuming their move has enough knockback. He can charge this move, and if uncharged, the cannonball will drop right in front of him, and can be used as a Soccer Ball type item for K. Rool. 

* N-Special 2: *Blunderbuss Gas*. K. Rool fires a burst of slow-moving poisonous gas instead of a cannonball. If an opponent gets trapped in it, it'll be a continuous attack that doesn't make opponents flinch, like Fox's laser or Palutena's Heavenly Light. Think the Ashley Assist Trophy in cloud form. 

* N-Special 3: *Blunderbuss Dash*. Instead of firing a cannonball, the blast from the blunderbuss can be used to dash K. Rool forwards or backwards. Wonderful for moving across the stage. 

S-Special: *Crown Toss*. K. Rool throws his crown as a boomerang attack. It acts a lot like you'd expect, except it's multi-hit and can trap opponents on the way back. He can still move around while it moving, and activate other moves, but once it touches K. Rool again, it will return to him, allowing for some insane mind games. 

* S-Special 2: *Crown Shot* K. Rool can throw the crown faster and farther, but at the cost of charging it. 

* S-Special 3: *Crown Volley*. A lot like the actual Boomerang item, K.  
Rool can hit the B Button again to launch the crown back. 

Up Special: *Helicopter Pack*. K. Rool pulls out his helicopter pack from DKC3 and uses it to fly upwards. The blades are a hitbox, but K. Rool is vulnerable everywhere else. Once the move is over, it'll disappear and he'll go into freefall. 

* U-Special 2: *Electric Pack*. It has an electric effect and can damage opponents on the way up, but it has a shorter range. 

*U-Special 3: *Explosive Pack*. It will explode with high knockback at the climax of the attack. K. Rool will take 5% damage if it happens, but he'll receive no knockback. 

D-Special: *Kremling Krush*. A lot like Bowser Bomb, except it creates a rather large shockwave that traps opponents. References his DK64 fight. 

* D-Special 2: Kremling Jump*. He'll jump upwards with great force and a gust effect, but the move can be cancelled into an aerial.  




 This is no different than the random appearance of platforms in Fountain of Dreams in Melee, or Yoshi's Island in Brawl. If it is indeed Final Destination-shaped, it should be legal. Assuming that the Dog's the only random platform and there are no actual hazards.  




 Duck Hunt: Some wild dog running in the wild, hunting, when he's ambushed by villains. Somebody saves him, and he's now following them around to help them. 

Wii Fit Trainer: She's jogging and the road is blocked by some baddies. She whoops them and meets up with Wario, who's captured somebody. Being Wario, she wants to fix his problem, and assists whoever's chasing him.

Little Mac: Training with Doc and sees Donkey Kong. Challenges him. Helps him when they finish and someone wins.  




 I stick with the classic Blue Bomber, of course. 

However, I also dabble with my Tux Dr. Mario.  









 All the references to the Sorcerer's Apprentice made me freak out, especially the broom and turning the apprentice into a mouse. As a huge fun of the Mickey shorts and films, this was amazing. 

Henry as the new Sorcerer's Apprentice makes sense. He's the one that reunites all of these fairy tales, and will obviously be playing with some magic. He's our human Mickey, and I honestly couldn't be happier.  




 I'm male and I love this show. t's worth watching at least once.  




 Touche.
