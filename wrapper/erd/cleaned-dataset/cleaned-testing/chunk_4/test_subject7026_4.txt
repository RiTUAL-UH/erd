 Three actually, Buff Banner, Black Box and Battalion's Backup 




 That's pretty cool, although now I kinda wanna make a new account on my birthday to make them line up. 









 I was thinking link karma. Don't look at my profile for a few days. 




 I'm gonna go whore some upvotes from a nsfw Subreddit.  
  
Honestly if you're on a nsfw sub for personal reasons you're not gonna downvote are you? 




 I was gonna put it on but said "Nah I'll get downvoted, probably." 




 That's how it works? Man are my cheeks red. 




 My cake day was in April I don't know what I put on reddit lmao 




 :[] 




 I know we have context and everything, but if we're in a "What is the most OP weapon in TF2?" thread and someone says Buff Banner then someone replies with "It's countered by the Boston Basher" the moment someone says "BB" the entire thread just stops and needs to ask.  
  
Here's a list of all the 'BB's we have.  
Buff Banner  
Black Box  
Boston Basher  
Battalion's Backup  
Back Burner  
Brass Beast  
Bread Bite  
Bazaar Bargain  
Beggar's Bazooka  
Bilbo Bag- Wait a second  
We have 9 weapons that are called this, please stop saying BB it always ends badly.  
**Edit** Beggar's and Backback/Backup 




 He doesn't need to, he could take down one bot and feed himself for a few months and pay the power bills. He also wouldn't have space for all of the items, so there's that. 














 Unplug the scout's internet. No rewards for you, you young whippersnapper. 




 Eugh get it away this is inhumane! 




 Kick the Scout.

 Hey it's you again! You have a sweet Gastly hat. 




 If you are a rich dude you could get a [Polar Pullover] (http://i.imgur.com/3831GRF.png) which is pretty much the way around a hat that can't be unusual. 




 Disco Beat Down is probably the best effect of all time. 




 Thanks for linking me to this, but unfortunately I have a Titanium Tyrolean Miami Nights, it's funny though because the thing I want so much is a Vintage Tyrolean with Disco Beat Down. 




 I don't think anyone calls you cool. 




 Don't just give in to the haters, when haters give you lemons you know what you do? You take those lemons and squeeze them right into the eyes and scream "I DON'T WANT YOUR DAMN LEMONS! DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE GIVING LEMONS TO? I AM DERPYDOSEGAMEZ, I'M THE MAN WHO'S GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH THE LEMONS! I WILL SQUEEZE LEMON JUICE INTO YOUR BURN WOUNDS!" 




 This is how you piss of multiple 7 year olds c: 




 I don't think that's a very good comparison, the issue the guy is having is that if Geel were to bet 3% of every pot he would receive 3% back because there's a 3% cut going to the site. If he puts in nothing he still gains 3% of the pot, if he puts in 3% and wins he gets it all, if he puts in 3% and loses he gets back the same value that he put in.  
  
The problem with your car example is that the salesman would not be gaining extra. I don't see a huge issue with what Geel is doing but I can see why others would. 




 Excluding keys, kinda. 




 Mine is a Disco Beat Down Vintage Tyrolean which is around 80 keys and so far I have around 30 keys towards it, I'd say a Miami Nights Titanium Tyrolean is close enough, right?  
  
Anyway, what is your dream unusual? You trying to get it with keys? Maybe on the Steam Community Market? How about PayPal trades, maybe you're doing that for it! 




 I think "Considering you died...." works just as well. Puts a bit of salt into that piss. 




 The stickies were placed, even if there were 8 they may have been all scattered. This is a complete reason for it not to go down. 




 The tf2 wiki agrees that 8 stickies will kill a sentry? Of course it will, but will it destroy them when they aren't directly under it?

 [Holy balls of all the times for this start playing from my playlist is also the time I see a post about it.] (http://i.imgur.com/etqDtZ6.png) 




 Yes, because that is the reason for a sentry to not go down to a demo. 




 Shoot down with the wrangler and they wont do damage because they have been spread, and before you try to weasel your way out of this by saying "Maybe the engineer doesn't know how to do this", he's doing the Sigafoo save, he knows how to right click.

 There was a thread a couple days ago about hp being about the classes health size, this post is of a Soldier on a set of scales checking his weight. 




 "Demo Down"  
  THAT'S THE WRONG BIND! 




 Can we raid other tf2 subreddits? For example, /r/truetruetf2 with Stout Shakos or /r/tf2memes with [this] (https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ7mtjxkhEkfJMdUAKHu2diXNJcHU8gMWXO4qCjrarA_MpwWeuRjQ) or [this] (http://41.media.tumblr.com/a8ec701fac8ebd3d42616d6c0acf76ce/tumblr_nndm6hKFUV1re2kqmo1_500.jpg)  
  
I'm not saying we should, but is it breaking the rules considering they are basically /r/tf2? 




 If you eat their liver with a side of some fava beans and a nice chianti it's peaceful. 




 What's the deal with the "Use this as a vector" and "Pro Ks Sandman Kit" stuff? What country are you in that uses vectors and baseball bats for sniping? 




 I know I know, but it's so satisfying to see "wow dude that was just cruel" and "DAMN SON YOU NEED SOME ICE FOR THAT BURN!?" and on occasion I see "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_burn_centres_in_cp_Dustbowl] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)"

 That's... Actually a great idea! 




 I need some rap binds, care to throw them to me? 




 I made some responses because I'm sure some of you want some and I asked some friends for replies.  
  
"If you only heal good players then why do you have auto regen?"  
"HAHAHA HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!"  
"I have 950 hours lmao"  
"Your aim is worse than Helen Keller"  
"20 -5 + 300, sure"  
"Where'd you get your clothes, the toilet store?"  
"HAHAHA HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!"  
"HAHAHA HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!"  
"HAHAHA HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!"   




 My personal experience with getting insulted is to make a witty reply, but I seem to be running low on replies, What do you guys say when faced with these insults?  
  

"I only heal good players"  
"TF2 is free to uninstall"  
"Bodyshotting prick"  
"Have you even played this game? Like seriously, have you?"  
"Your aim is worse than Michael J Fox's"  
"How many airshots do you have, -5?  
"Your (insert class here) looks like trash"  
"You are as presumptuous as you are poor and irish!"  
"Dude, you'd get a closed casket at the ugly cemetery!"  
"You're like a car crash in slow motion, it's like I'm watching you fly through a windshield"  
"You suck on ice!"  
  
I only have responses like "If you only heal good players then why do you have auto regen?" and "HAHAHA HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!"  
  
Feel free to insult me, I really need to step up my comeback game. 




 MvM pls 




 If every one of your comments on the thread have -points then you're probably wrong. Just stop trying to defend what you're saying, you're clearly incorrect for it.

 My argument is that Call of Duty is equal to a real war in terms of the graphic gameplay, and Team Fortress 2 is equal to Tom and Jerry.  
  
Team Fortress 2 is one of the most childish games around, it's a hat simulator with a few guns and swords. 




 Then what say you, Jesus of the Deer, shall I wear a rack? 




 I was a different dude, you would think that after so many suggestions for it to be 2 refined they would just go "Fuck it, we'll do it live!"

 And over here we see the Call of Duty community with 5 year olds playing a more realistic shooter. Team Fortress 2 is cartoonish enough to be a spin off from some Warner Bros show.

 "o" 




 Adding to the spam bind right freaking now! 




 It's actually a funny story, I told some of my friends that I paypal scammed someone out of a Sulphorus Killer Exclusive because I felt like it would be something cool to discuss for a few days. So I choose some high tier yet slightly believable hats and told them I sold the KE to buy these.  
The reason I thought of doing this was because I had a 24 hour ban on backpack.tf for a price suggestion to make the Stout Shako 2 refined. Only one person knew that was the reason I was banned, it was pretty entertaining.  
  
I didn't actually paypal scam anyone and I never will, mostly because I don't have a paypal. 




 Experienced. Months.  
Hate to burst your bubble but even 6 months wouldn't be much experience. 




 Oh yeah, there is a map named "itemtest". I completely forgot about that! 




 Why not both? Ariba ariba! 




 how to fast as emporor pengiun? 




 I have Stranges because they count kills, I have Vintages because I get them thrown in during trades, I have like one Genuine because I sell them fast, Collectors items are useless to me and unusuals look cool. 




 But I'm on the blue team, our love can never be true :[

 God speed, Demon Hell Man. 




 Can I get a screenshot of this Gastly? Gengar is my 3rd favourite Pokmon behind Arcanine and Cinncino. 




 There are like 20 Trade Servers always available, being unable to sell there means you're a bad trader or your hat is bad, if you resort to pubs then you need to quicksell for 75% value. 




 If they have put enough time into trading to get unusuals they must have played before, if somebody only has the game for the trading, why would they go on a pub to find buyers? Why would they go into the actual game? 




 Because fuck you guys, New Zealand rules! 




 Are you saying that after maybe 50 hours someone will have 3 cosmetics for one class? Unless they got them from the store, which I doubt because unless you're very invested in a game you should not be spending $5 on it for basically no reason.  
  
What kind of trader is only in their first pub when they get an unusual? Even if they do want buyers they still have the appearance of a person who has put enough time into obtaining it. 




 That's the spooky eyes in a cloud effect right? If it is then wow man that is, like, godly for that hat.  
Although if I may add my own input here, I personally dislike the confetti effects, they aren't as visible as they should be, unfortunately. 




 Petition to change d0's steam name to "d0(   )" 




 woah Woah WOAH MAN CHILL MAN CHILL WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE JUST CHILL OUT MAN 




 Proud of you, man. 




 Hats do, however = More time in game = More experience.  
  
If I'm wearing an unusual people will see a man with enough investment in the game to trade up to an unusual or buy one.  
  
A Gibus just shows that you dominated another Gibus player. 




 They call me the Training Wheels, because I tend to pocket Gibus players. How can they kill something when they can't fly as demonstration man? 




 The problem with all stock is that many pro players use stock cosmetics, sometimes they use the Party Hat for some reason. 




 As someone with an unusual, I can confirm I get treated like the wooden dude from Tekken.  
That means I get my shit pushed in constantly. 




 I pocket my friends. Like 3 feet into their pockets, I almost refuse to heal anyone else unless they help build uber or have an unusual. 




 as texas rattlesnake, how deploy tiny robocop?  
what make fat bloke get fish and chips?  
how to kill as fat?

 OP is he is the she her he lady man lady he her man she. 




 That would be so OP though. 




 If you aren't sure how it works, here's basically how to use it!  
  
Type in some things you want to spam with the press of a button, for example  
  
what button sprints guys?  
how to fly as demonstration man?  
how to be boom boom king?  
where get burny bison hat?  
  
Then when you're finished with them, press "Clear the Server"  
You will get a huge wall of text, copy that and paste it into a notepad and [save it as] (http://i.imgur.com/ye6xGVv.png) "Trash.cfg", you will now want to be sure to save it as [all files] (http://i.imgur.com/tUrYe9g.png)  
  
Locate your ["cfg"] (http://i.imgur.com/3msMFLg.png) folder in your tf folder, look for literally any mod guide and you *should* get directions on how to get here, assuming you did it correctly you should be able to go into tf2 and type "exec trash" in the console, alternatively you could probably use autoexec or something but I'm not some turbonerd who knows how to use that.  
  
When you get into a server press the "P" key to say a random line from what you wrote!  
Enjoy getting votekicked! 









 For what weapons? 




 helo is me ur brother give me ur item i will hold good trade yes 




 It isn't really true like this though, Sniper can right click then left click for an instant 150 damage, killing most classes in one hit. Scout's speed is countered by the Engineer, Medic isn't the only class that can heal, you are correct in saying it is the easiest but Engineer and Heavy can do it too. There's also health kits but whatever. Being fast means nothing when you're facing a good Sniper. Healing isn't possible when you've been killed by a good sniper. Even a Heavy isn't safe if the sniper can hold his horses for a minute. 




 I would practice to do that but I main Medic and Soldier, I guess Crit Ubersaw Stair Stabs will have to do. 




 I've only been on the receiving end of this before. :[ 




 Sucks to be OP because I made it first. 




 Fun Fact, Snoop Dogg did not say "Smoke Weed Errday", it was actually Nate Dogg. Now spread that fact with all of your friends who doubted your musical knowledge. 




 A .WAH? 




 Sniper because I had no skill. 




 I'll give you 2 scrap and a Vintage Eyelander for a Burning Flames Team Captain.
