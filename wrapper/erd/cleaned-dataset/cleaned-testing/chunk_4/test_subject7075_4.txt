 Damn. That's powerful. 

As a lot of people previously mentioned: we are - well, most of us - too brainwashed to think otherwise. They think our government is just and righteous, and acts solely in favor of the people. That couldn't be further from the truth.

I'll get behind anyone who wants to take our country back. 




 So capitalist in your ways of thinking  




 So the last time I smoked was 4/20. I told myself I had to take a tolerance break if I wanted to get an internship for the summer. So I finally landed one, passed the drug test, and decided to celebrate this weekend after my first week of work. My buddy and I rolled 2 blunts and we packed my vape  (Arizer Solo) a couple times. I was expecting to get stoned since I haven't smoked in so long, but nothing. I barely even got high, and the "high" only lasted half an hour max. We were smoking cherry pie and it was some pretty dank stuff, but for some reason it wasn't working for me. 

Any insight would be much appreciated! 




 Hey I feel your pain. I've noticed the same trends on 9gag. Scrolling through the posts and reading comments which were initially there for my entertainment, became something unseemingly sinister. The people are mean - not just a little mean, but the truest from of the word. They revel in their bad habits of being shut-ins, and unmotivated membera.of society who wish to do nothing more than play their games and bully those who think differently than themselves.

I've decided to kill my time through books and sketching, rather than giving my thumb a workout through the toxicity of that website. 




 I'm the messy inbox, android, beer over soda, multiple alarms, cash, and "haha"  kind of person.

 This is one of the few nosleep series I'm actually enjoying. Please update! 




 Say something like: "the prince of darkness resides here."

 I have one that isn't too creepy, but interesting nonetheless. 

My father came to the United States roughly 30 years ago, purchased a house, and then my mom had me shortly after. The original owner of the house was an old woman who had the house since its construction in the early 1900s. My father was a handyman and decided to construct a deck in the backyard. While he was digging the foundation for the deck, he noticed a concrete slab about 15 feet from the back of the house. It turned out to be a time-capsule the woman left for previous owners. We dug it up and sorted through the knick-knacks she left for us. Nothing too interesting or out of the ordinary; just pictures of the house from back in the day and newspaper clippings from the second world war and other important events. With the discovery,of the time-capsule came the discovery that the old woman passed away in the house. It is unknown how she passed, but we later found out she passed away in the room I sleep in now. Ever since then I started to notice strange events throughout the house. There have been a couple times where lights have turned off by themsleves, doors have closed, and have even had my clothes moved off my floor into the hamper. One instance that I will not forget was when I was alone in the house with my music playing downstairs (pretty loudly) when all of a sudden I heard a loud "ssshhh!" come from the top of the stairs. I knew it had to be her.

Never once have I felt threatened; I really feel at peace in my home. I feel as if her spirit  (if you want to make those conclusions) is that of a typical old woman. She turns the lights off when we're not in the room, closes the doors so our dogs don't make a mess of our room, picks up my dirty clothes, and even tells me to be quiet when I'm making too much noise.  




 Hey Jim - if you were to cut open a hot pocket and use it to pleasure yourself, at what temperature would you like the hotpocket to be?
