 because Hamilton fanboys are complete morons

they are the ones who comment "It's sabotage" anytime something happens to Hamilton 




 i wouldn't compare them until they both have a better car so far it's been a piece of shit 




 considering he imminently blamed grosjean i don't see him growing out of it soon

you only learn from mistakes if you can admit you made one

 




 makes sense 




 figured i'd post this as it seems not many people have seen it and it's still up on youtube atm 









 back onboard camera of Grosjean if anyone hasn't seen it yet

 Grosjean doesn't need to explain himself Max was at fault even though he doesn't want to admit it 




 i've been applying for a few jobs lately and found that a lot but not all redirect to their own website and ask you to fill out forms which ask for the same details which are on your resume

why do some places do this? example is they ask for previous employment history and references yet they would be in the resume

edit- forget to add they also ask you to upload a  resume 




 he may of not said it but he's implying it especially by saying he's got the hallmarks of schumacher/senna
 




 brundle has basically already said it about Verstappen

Verstappen will be a world championship-winning team before he is 20. He is showing all the hallmarks of a Senna, of a Schumacher in my view,  




 the racing and results so far i just think sainz has a lot more potential but it isn't recongised as much because Verstappen gets more hype due to his age 




 i think sainz is a great driver who isn't being recognised as much because of the hype surrounding the younger Verstappen

i honestly think he has the better chance of being a future world champion and would be a waste of good talent if he isn't picked up by one of the bigger teams 









 most Hamilton fans see it as exactly that but there is always idiot fanboys making comments about sabotage etc 




 anytime something happens to Hamilton his fanboys come out with the sabotage remarks. 




 before i even opened it i knew there would be a comment about it being a sabotage

 




 still is this is just a massive Mercedes fuck up for hamilton 




 why did hamilton pit? just gave away the win 




 for good reason it's a shit track that only exists because it's historic

it's time to retire it and get a better track that allows some actual racing 




 that's the problem it's a historic track they'll never get rid of it no matter how more boring the races get

if this was not a historic track it would of been abandoned years ago
 




 always is at Monaco worst race of the season by far

if it wasn't a historical track it would of been ditched years ago 




 it's for people new to the sport you dingleberry

sports don't survive if they don't get new fans

 




 you could say the same about everyone using a smartphone or buying any clothes made in sweatshop countries

pretty sure many have died making the things we all go out and buy on a daily basis and no one seems to care 




 people are stupid 




 also any clothes made in china or the other sweatshop countries which is basically everything we buy 




 just people jumping on the bandwagon give it a few days they won't care anymore 




 kimi needs to improve or he won't have a seat soon enough 




 so how many of you actually cared about Qatar before the visa and coke threads?

typical bandwagon jumping that you will all forget about when these threads die down,  you will then continue life as normal using smartphones built in sweat shops and wearing clothes made under worse conditions yet no thread for that 
 




 then forget about a day or two later when this drops off the main page

i'd wager money most people commenting didn't give a fuck about Qatar before this
 




 they are settling back into their usual position

last year was a one off 




 shouldn't be illegal due to the stupidity of the person who didn't secure it 




 not really a bad thing lots of idiots on the road

they must of bribed the driving instructor to pass them
 




 it won't at least not on something as big as the world cup

even if sponsors pull out someone will front the money and the show will go on and it will be watched by millions/billions

people wanted to boycott Russia during the winter Olympics because of the gay laws they passed yet it had no impact 




 the world cup will go ahead in Qatar as planned even if coke or whoever else pulls out

hundreds of millions if not billions around the world will still watch it when it's on in 2022

no one will remember this post as people tend to jump on bandwagons and then move on completely forgetting about it
 




 any form of comedy as it seems these days more and more people are "offended" by jokes 




 this is also why product placement is increasing in all shows if people don't watch commercials they will just get the show to drink their drinks with the labels showing on camera etc 




 it's impressive for a first time but he has to do in qualifying for it to mean anything 




 all depends on how he qualifies 




 nope that's fucking retarded

music is music people are people big fucking difference between them no matter what the history of the music is

i also hate classical and country i guess this means i hate white people as well




 




 yep that's how retarded people are becoming 




 rap (mostly the new crap these days) is just shit doesn't make someone racist for hating shit music 




 there is always someone willing to do that they then forget about it a day or two later and wait for the next controversy to pretend to care about 




 it's likely a translation issue and he didn't meant it the way the rest of us see the word

although there is always people who will pretend to be offended by it cause a stink about it then forget about it a few days later when they move on to the next "controversy" to pretend to care about 




 kimi is on is his last legs within the next year or two ferrari will replace him 




 honestly i think Ricciardo gets a little more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came from safety cars and when Mercedes had issues

what i want to see is him get a good car for a few years and see if he can consistently pull off results like 2014 or if it was just a one off

right now the red bull is a turd so you can't count this year to be fair to him 




 sport games are the worst offenders.. cod and battlefield are bad but at least try to bring something new 




 this game is becoming the FIFA of the racing games

they need to add more to it (not sure what) but just following the actual sport and making slight adjustments to AI and handling just isn't enough to want to buy it each year

 




 he also ate all but one of the outside chair cushions he now sits on the remaining one every day 




 he would be thrown into a mental asylum if he came back today

"i'm the son of god"... sure you are buddy right this way to the padded wall room 




 popular vote runs a risk of people voting against it there is still a lot of people (mostly old but some young) who are against it

many might not even publicly say it either and can vote no without anyone else knowing 




 this will probably pass but is this type of vote the best way to do it?

there are a lot of people who are against gay marriage but might not ever say it in public.. voting like this allows them to vote no without anyone else knowing 




 i don't think he has many years left in F1

Ferrari will be looking at other drivers to replace him (probably Bottas or Ricciardo)

he needs more results like bahrain if he wants to keep his seat
