 Honestly, one of the most disturbing things I have seen. I can handle gore. But buff children? Nope. 




 "Can you fuck it??" 




 *Shoe 




 It's called a horse show crab 




 OP, we demand answers. Where is your fucking roommate? 




 Thanks! I don't hate my ex for breaking up with me though. I just wish our relationship had lasted longer. The breakup was really sudden and unexpected on my end. A couple days before December started he just up and tells me he doesn't love me anymore in that way and it was over. I already had gotten his Christmas present early. He was my first bf too. 




 You're at an HEB! 




 I wasn't expecting to spend Valentine's Day alone this year. Now I'm going to be spending it alone. 




 Cunt 




 I would so fucking vote for them 




 Just saying "no" would've been less amusing 




 Fuckin' 




 Didn't Hitler have his moustache in that fashion because he enjoyed Chaplin's films? I think that's the reason but I'm not sure. Correct me if I'm wrong. 




 *shit* 









 I tried salvia one time and I will never go back. My trip was messed up. I grew a hole in the top of my head and water started coming out it, soaking my entire body. Then it was water out of every oriface. I melted into my chair, and my arms fell off. Then I came back together, turned into a black man and got so scared because my friends turned into the KKK and had a burning cross in front of me, and they were all waiting to lynch me. I'm never doing it again. 




 This makes me feel good. My brother is a chef and attended Le Cordon Bleu in Austin. He taught me all these tips about knives. 




 I love PostSecret. I think this one comes from the Secret Lives of Men and Women compilation book. 




 A lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex food places in my area warn customers that their food may contain small bones and other fiberous tissue that might have not been completely ground up.
An artery is nothing. If its cooked and edible, eat it. 




 No matter if people think that statement sounds racist, it is so true. 




 His painting looks like its made out of shit. If I had to paint him, that's what I'd use in order to match his personality. 




 I could troll people at nursing homes 




 HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THAT?!? 




 I always preferred Marvel over DC. Fuck me, right? 




 It's a repost. If you wonder why you might get down voted, just understand. 




 No it didn't you filthy asshole.
This is a repost. 




 Am I the only one who doesn't get it? 




 What a bitch. Repost 




 Turns out, this fox is a liberal democratic communist loving facist. More at 10 after a full hour of Nacy Grace bitching her viewers out. 




 Mine too 




 Exactly 




 ARE YOU AT BLINN IN BRENHAM, TEXAS?? 




 I thought it was semi funny because all the girls look like feet and horses (except the one on the far left). Never mind then... 




 Rafael Alencar and Johnny Rapid. 




 Please don't tell me this little alien abortion lives in Texas. I have to leave this state. NOW. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES. AND SOULS! 




 I've always wondered what his first experience getting sexed up was like. You know. Since he couldn't touch it himself. It was like super brand new probably. 




 More like THANK YOU for bringing this to a movie theater. 




 Little ginger complained about being kicked on national Kick a Ginger Day. What a punk. Lets go kick him. 




 Agreed. The caption was brilliant. 




 This is cool! I've never seen one begin decomposing in one of those before. 




 Not wtf but I have to say its sort of clever. 




 About to catch fire? What am I? A fucking psychic? 




 Already been suggested somewhere on reddit. Someone posted it back when all those kids at Sandy Hook went down. 




 You are mighty handsome looking! 




 When they first had a website, I wanted to go on it, so I asked my mom which key was the backwards G. 




 I'm so tired of seeing this picture get posted... 




 I love the picture of Raven at the bottom. "If you can't love yourself, then how the hell are you gonna love somebody else? Can I get a amen up in here?" "AMEN!" 




 It was all the fault of the police for not securing the scene. Everyone rushed in, contaminated evidence, and the prosecution fucked up in nearly every way during the trial. 




 Lemme correct myself, they look like they just hatched a several hours ago 




 This in a month? She's in stage two decomp from what it looks like! 




 Almost. From the looks of it, they're still eggs. 




 Good job at getting the joke! 




 Think about it. It's not scurrying around your place anymore. 




 They just need to be more obvious with their sexual attractions towards each other. Makeout in public, film themselves fucking, spread the tape and watch all the teenage girls realize they never stood a chance. So much blood would be shed. 




 Ok, Hinduism. Still wanted to point out that fact it's not the swastika. 




 I have blue/green eyes and after I've been crying, the color goes bright green. Not lying. 




 The Nazis didn't. Stop being stupid. The Nazis stole that symbol, turned it another way, and used to symbolize their Ayran pride. It originates in Asia and is common to find on statues of Buhdda and in temples around different countries.  It is a symbol of peace. 




 *goose 




 I agree 




 *duck

(please go in the direction I'm hoping) 




 Same here 




 I love Tina. Amy as well. 




 OH MY GOD. MUST GET TO WALMART. 




 Quick! Someone slap a brazzers logo on it. 




 Why is John Lennon kissing that man? Oh wait. 




 *eagle 




 Oh god. Now everytime he arouses me I will think of this and get turned off. 




 When suddenly a black man took a picture in front of the booth? This photo tell us nothing. 




 Bitch is serving straight up fish. Whether its cross dressing, doing drag, or dressing as woman due to the fact you might be transgendered, he still looks good painted. Whatever his reason, he looks good. 




 The magic of drag 




 Holy molestor powers, activate! 




 Cards against humanity 




 Bravo 




 FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET LEARN TO SPELL IT RIGHT FAGET 




 Wonder if he ever attended a Wigstock festival back in the day 




 I wonder if Johnny Rapid knows when he poops... 




 I never went to see the movie in fear of heavy disappointment. Whatever I've heard from people who have actually seen the series, I am so glad I didn't go see it. 




 It is supposed to be a wine holder. It's only because you have a dirty mind that you wanted it to be what you think it is. 




 So envious! It's beautiful!
