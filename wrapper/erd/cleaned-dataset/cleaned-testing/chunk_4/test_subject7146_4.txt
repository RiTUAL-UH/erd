 Of course, if I was in healthcare. It would be my job, and it's kinda hard to get. It's not like some kind of airborne disease or anything. 




 Herp, Derp,   Gerp. 




 Yeah, but you have a good start to getting things going. 401k, emergency savings, etc.  




 10k won't last long at all without a job. Get an income before you lose what you have. 




 There are, actually. But they're brewed differently. The bags go in the brewer, not the cup. There's instant coffee for that. 




 I played morrowind until I was uber. I went and killed the god in the volcano and the one on that southeastern island. Really didn't know what to do after that and just stopped playing.  




 Thexder. I was stuck on one of the last levels for years. Put the old 286 in a closet, pulled it out 10 years later, game disk still works. Played through all the way to the end. I was stunned it took over a dozen years to beat the damn thing.  




 I thought they changed it so the spin counted to the ramp up.  




 1-20 years. 




 The giant ear hoop things that stretch them out. Seriously, have you ever seen them without the rings in? Just gross. 




 Nothing on xda for it?  




 Nova won't do it, but sslauncher is insanely customizable and does gingerbread  




 I'm still a fan of sslauncher. It takes a while to figure it out, but once you do there isn't much you can't do. Gridless screen to place stuff exactly, can overlap them and move them from front to back, has great options even before using zooper or the like, has a separate header area at the top of the screen that can follow different rules. Plus it will work on much older devices than nova. 

Or when I want a customized look without the effort, I'll use buzz launcher and download someone else's customized screen.  




 Actually, I pay for 15 and get 22-24. Mediacom though, so...

edit: Lol I was wondering how many downvotes I'd get for this one.

 Andmade Share, More Shortcuts, URL Copy are the 3 I that have the largest effect on my phone operations. I have a bunch I put on every ROM, but these three are my essentials. 




 I just started Californication. Very pleasantly surprised. Everyone is crazy. 




 Me too. 




 I just double the tax, then adjust for the service. 




 Yeah, it's definitely uncomfortable to say the least. I asked the mother "You let him do that?" She just said "He can do whatever he wants." 




 Back in the day I went with a guy I knew to get some weed. We sat around this fatass woman's table and watched her 6 year old son drink beer, smoke cigarettes, and toke on a joint. Yeah, I never went anywhere with him again.

 Huh. TIL Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who. 




 I don't see why they would ask for a reason. Tons of folks do it, nearly none of them are up to anything shady. 




 As I go through custum roms, I notice that very few have a 180 option when they have the options in their display settings. That is, not only is there a rotate screen toggle, some roms have toggles for 0,90, 270, while even fewer have a 180 toggle.  I think it's a rom restriction. Right now I'm on CM7 on a Droid X2 so I can be on Straight Talk over the Verizon network, and in my CyanogenMod settings  Accelerometer rotation I have toggles for all four views.

edit: Didn't mention that the rotation works for all apps that work in those mods. So games that only are landscape work on either 90 or 270, when they are toggled in my settings, and something else that rotates, say bacon reader, works on all four sides. I haven't seen an app that was restricted beyond what rotations are toggled.

edit2: I take that back. I seem to remember one game that only worked at 90, wouldn't flip to the other side for some reason. Had to be the app restricting it. 




 I don't think you know what "literally" actually means... 




 Yeah, saw a scout running around today. It's cool in the sense that you can majorly change up your scout, but it's pretty ugly.  




 You can't gift wrap them?  




 BTW, I just installed JuiceDefender and there is an option in the ultimate app that lets you  control data access for any app individually. It's been so long since I've used it that I've forgotten the option was there. 




 I have no idea. You might look thru xda, I'm willing to bet if it's not a huge task that someone has or knows how to come up with something. 




 I'm coming up with a blank. I know there are several options to control when data comes on automatically, that would stop everything except calls and texts and check all your stuff on a regular basis.  JuiceDefender has a crap ton of options, especially the pro version. But I'm seeing very little to control certain apps. 




 If you're on KitKat go into settings and find the application manager then Whatsapp, turn off the  notification there. 




 I just got this last week for under $20 with prime and a discount code (which I don't remember and have dumped my email trash since), works awesomely. Can even charge it while it's in use.

 Pavarotti found alive and well. 




 Search the playstore for pricecheck. I'm using on that has been taken off the market some time ago, but there are a few apps  that are fairly close to what you're looking for, though I don't know if any check past prices. 




 They only kinda worked for me. What really straightened me out for a good while was a switch. I shot all our storm windows with a bb gun. He went to the plum tree, got a branch, had me hold the back of a chair, and gave me 3 licks. Oh dear lord the pain. I was good for months after that. 




 And can be thrown. Ceiling sentries would confuse the hell out of folks.  




 I read that as pent-house bears and thought you were a genius. After rereading, I now only find you clever. 




 Thir, yeth thir! 




 I've always assumed that the lockscreen was just another app too, and replacements would just disable the stock app and run on boot instead. I never felt it was an overlay or bootstrap or anything like that, but I've never delved into lockscreens, either. I'm fuzzy on that one myself. Gonna see what stuff looks like real quick, got me curious.  




 I just let it loop in the past. It slowly gains ground with each loop, and eventually will get all the way through the charging icon and let the screen shut off. The screen is the big drain, when it can get through to have it off again it'll charge faster. 

That's been my experience, anyway.  




 The launcher is just an app, it's not like an extension of the OS or anything. It's just an app that holds links to various aspects of the phone you want to get to or run, as well as performing other stuff, like runnig widgets. Even the app drawer is just another part of the launcher, it's not inherent in the OS. It is another layer of Android in the same manner that any other app is.  




 Keep it plugged in and forgot about it for a while. Your battery is stone dead, and trying to change. The tiny bit it's getting is mostly being spent trying to get into the whole charging-while-off screen. I've been through the same thing numerous times. Give it an hour and see where you are. 

I could be wrong, but I think I'm right.  




 I would think the first and best place to find this info would be xda developers.  




 So far as I can tell, to use a Verzon phone over the Verizon network on Straight Talk, the phone must be CDMA only, which generally means 3G, no LTE capabilities, and cannot have a sim card slot, except for iPhones. However, I know things are changing these days, and my info may be outdated already. 

Myself, I'm using my Droid X2, Cyanogenmod 7.2 (Android 2.3.7) and it seems to me about the best I can do without going iPhone 5. 




 Oh, I know that by using my 4 year old phone that I'm missing out on more and more, and it's my fault for not keeping up, not a programmer's. I stay away from Verizon (the only good reception around these parts) by using Straight Talk, which means 3G CDMA phones with no LTE capabilities only. But I just got an email from Cricket they have 4G here now, which means better phones, so gonna look into that. 

So, yeah, I can ramble on...  




 "Your device isn't compatible with this version." 

Droid X2, CWM 7.2.0, Android 2.3.7

Sigh. I miss out on some good stuff.  




 Yeah, I just saw another article saying the Android app comes out next week.  




 They won't have one. You'd have to contact a dealer. Since they cost some $3500 each sale is going to tale some real time with a dealer.  




 No, but lately I've been recording my dealings with utility companies, thanks to assorted redditor's postings. 




 Got deep pockets?

 lol Yeah, even OEM stuff goes bad.  




 I really only see a couple apps that could help. Of course, if you want to go through them one at a time and put whatever pic you want in there when you have time you can.

 Oh, nice idea. Gonna hunt around...  




 It doesn't even have to be a bad cable to mess up things. An after market cable that charges fine and connects to your computer for data transfer fine can gum up the works when flashing. OEM cables are really the only way to help insure smooth flashing, rooting, etc.  




 I tried to be the 44% a couple weeks ago. I didn't know I had 2 months left on my contract with Dish when I called to cancel my $60 a month subscription, but told them I wanted to cancel anyway. I told them there wasn't anything they had to offer that I couldn't stream outside of the Weather Channel and the sports I couldn't get over the air. They ended up giving me a much better package plus all the premiums for $25 a month for 3 months without extending my contract and can cancel at any time. So in 2 months I can go ahead and join the 44% while saving a few bucks on the last 2 bills. 
 




 Why is iPhone the goto platform for anything anymore? 




 This is why I have a bag of those silicone packs that assorted items are packed with. They work incredibly well.  




 I actually poked around for one the other day, didn't see any. Lots of cracked apps, though.  




 Oh, ssLauncher was neat when I put the time to really edit the screens.
