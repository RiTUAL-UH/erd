 I'm sure she has a cozy job at MSNBC waiting for her. 









 The downvotes show that Redditors have no problem with Democrats committing crimes. 









 Still blaming Obama's failures on Republicans after 7 years?

It must be nice to be oblivious to consequences.

No accountability for our masters in Washington, DC. 









 We should crowd-fund an airdrop to keep the legend alive. 




 Every time you consider a candidate that wishes to grow the federal government remember that power always corrupts.  

We have seen many instances of this and will see more. 




 Obama and Holder are sending delegations to Iraq to ensure ISIS has not been subjected to civil rights abuses.


Oh, and to make sure our TOW missiles we gave them are still working. 




 The idea that rights come from a god means that no earthly person, group or government should be allowed to deny your basic rights.

Even if you don't believe in God, it's a nifty proposition that elevates individual rights above any possible usurpation. 




 Immediate downvotes in less time than the length of the video?

Please provide critique of the content, not just an insta-downvote because it's Ted Cruz and redditors say not to like him.

 Why do Americans want Iran to have nuclear weapons? 




 Liberals telling lies and shouting down the other side?

I'm shocked! 




 But..but...the conservatives!! 









 Democrats want to get money out of politics, provided that money is for Republicans. 




 And Obama supplied them with TOW missiles.

Think about that. 




 Here's another first.

First time in history a sitting US President has negotiated to put nuclear weapons in the hands of a nation that sponsors terrorism.

Yes we can! 









 Obama will be inviting him to the White House for a celebratory dinner, where he will say Islam has "built the fabric of America" and we should be ashamed of our Christian past. 









 To the Democrats, the means justifies the ends.

They will abuse power every chance they get. 




 Unwad your panties, Johann. 




 We're okay.  The ones who survived the original acidification were naturally selected to survive the next one. 




 Sitting in a quiet room by yourself. 




 After they become stars both groups are rich but I'm pretty sure Loretta Lynn didn't grow up in the cozy life. 




 Iran now clear to build nuclear weapons.  Russia invading Ukraine and just boldly hacked into our systems yet again.  China will soon make an effort to retake Taiwan militarily.  Islamic extremism is growing unchecked and even condoned in areas of the Middle East.


But who cares?  Obama made sure his bracket it filled out and his talk show appearances and golf are on the schedule. He's a hip, non-white guy and we aren't racist and stuff.  Plus he like promises us free stuff from those evil rich people.  That's all that matters. 









 If these people were wanted for assault, why not provide a description? 




 Iran with nuclear weapons?

Who cares?  We have like a cool President bro. 














 Yes and its up to the company to enforce it,  not the government. 




 Still waiting for him to admonish Islam as a whole just like he does every other day with Christianity. 




 Yet more harsh words regarding Christianity from Barack "The Muslim call to prayer is one of the prettiest sounds in the world." Hussein Obama. 









 Showing the true totalitarian nature of the leftist movement. 

Tolerance only for those that agree with me. 





























 If you think this is the case, please push for the State Trooper to be fired immediately for disobeying the elites.
 




 Liberals think communist China is more important than state sovereignty. 




 More enrichment of our culture. Celebrate diversity! 









 Please define "real war". 




 They're just so JV. 




 Maybe the account is off by a few days, but I'm sure the historical account would be accurate in regards to the season. 




 The Democrat Party: The party of control. 









 Almost all of the people on here will never set foot in Israel and are ignorant to the reality of rocket shells landing in their neighborhood simply because they are not Muslim.

You are mostly sheltered, naive and fed an agenda. 




 Where is the criticism of his religion by the fascist Reddit atheists? 




 Look at all the young, naive Redditors celebrating this. 

Iran will start World War 3.  But who cares?  We have like a cool President, bro. 




 Why does Islam get a free pass from the leftist mob?

 





























 Come back in ten years and read this post.  The Middle East and Europe will be in complete flames and you will have some life experience. 




 Is it going to be as good as Solyndra, where he gave his buddy $500 million and they immediately declared bankruptcy?

Iran has expressly stated they will "destroy Israel" and will start a nuclear war.

Millions of innocent people will die, but who cares?  We have a cool President that appears on Jimmy Kimmel. 




 No condemnation from Obama.  He's too busy "standing with the Muslims". 









 This is the product of liberal indoctrination in our public school system.

We freed 2/3rd of the world and 70 years later "we weren't much better."

Fuck off.

 There he goes again, "standing with the Muslims." 




 Don't take your God's name in vein. 




 Importing a Democrat voter base?

Yes we can!

 Indiana will be fine.  The politically correct mob of thought police need to back off.
