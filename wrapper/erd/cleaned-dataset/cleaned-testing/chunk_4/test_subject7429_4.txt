 CO is best state! 




 *9?* 




 It's working. I've fired a gun once in my life and after spending time on reddit, every picture with a gun makes me look if their finger's on the trigger. 




 I don't think I'm responsible enough. :P 




 Someone should make this. 




 I think that's just because Killswitch is a lot more radio friendly than the average metalcore band. Which could be a way that they're the Nickleback of the genre, I guess. 




 Good God, man! Restrain yourself! 




 A longer part would have been hilarious. 




 Oh, my god. I forgot he was in that movie! You're absolutely right! 




 Like the big climbing puzzles to get Altair's armor. Those were badass! 




 Was it really only 60? It felt like it went on for so long! 




 I think he's always been a Christian. He's just being a lot more open about it now. 




 I think it's amazing. You should at least give it a try. 




 I'd think it would be a much more mature Invader Zim, considering that guy wrote IZ. 




 I know it's not a real accent, but that weird shit from After Earth. Like... It's just bad. 




 /r/punk can help you out. They have regular posts about bands from certain countries, genres, etc. 




 It's always been his character. Easy to recognize. 




 It's true, though. Miatas are good cars, but people won't shut up about them. 




 I'm learning about it in school right now. Albeit in an optional class... 




 I feel stupid. I thought "flared" meant angry. 




 The guy's insane! 




 The AmA in question:

 A free doughnut? 




 That's not true. It went April, June, August, October, November. Only that last one actually came in about a month. 




 Isn't that like a tie-in with Flags of Our Fathers? 




 The graphics are actually still fairly good looking.  The game's aged really well.  I feel like, with that in mind, and HD remake would look pretty amazing. 




 Wow, thanks for explaining that. I hope everything gets better, soon. 




 Thanks for answering. That lighting actually sounds really cool! 




 I finally get to one of these early enough and I can't think of a question! I'll just settle with saying that the game looks amazing and I'm excited to see where else it goes! Big fan of Obsidion. Good luck!

Edit: OOH! I thought of some.
What thing about PoE has you most excited?
Also, what would you say is the most unique thing about the game? 




 Yeah... I'm usually not phased by gore, but... I think I'll just leave this one alone. 




 I usually do fine with gore, but I'm afraid to click literally every link in this thread. 




 I'm honestly curious if *this* would make someone cut again or want to stop right then. 




 Tellmewhatstherebecauseimscared 




 Post it. Now. 




 I understand you not liking Thrice's change in style, but personally, I thought they were just as good in the end. Obviously for different reasons, though. 




 Yeah, I liked then until Johnny left. Then it just wasn't the same. 




 I would've told my friend to go fuck himself. That's really shitty that he made you leave because he didnt want to be there. 




 "Sweetie, are you having some stomach problems?"
"Jesus, no! I was just beating off." 




 But all of the content seems to be from the 90s.  




 Holy shit, that *is* him in Raising Arizona, isn't it? 




 Nope 




 It's a famous scream that's heard in a LOT of movies.  




 This would be awesome if I wasn't TERRIFIED of open water. 




 I believe AC4 had an in-game answer about a modern AC. Something along the lines of vehicles not fitting the kind of game they want AC to be. 




 I think he always has the ring, he just doesn't wear it in the real world, where Mal is dead. In the dream world it's back on his finger because Mal is "alive" there. I could be completely wrong, though. 




 Written by the guy that writes the Walking Dead comics, too. 




 Those new-ish automatic shifters (like on the Prius) are the fucking devil at my wash. I've worked there over a year and still can't figure out accessory mode. 




 Only slightly related, but those stupid alarm systems that make the car *HONKHONKHONK* whenever you open or close the doors are ridiculous. 




 "Bless your heart" is the rudest way of saying that they pity you. And it hurts. 




 DAMMIT! DOLLARS, MAN, *DOLLARS!* 




 That whole trilogy is awesome! 




 Fuck, barely anyone remembers it now! 100 years just sounds silly. 




 What the fuck? Why? Those are fucking weird. 




 I was thinking the same about the second. I mean, Jesus... 














 Oh, I see. Thanks! 




 Does anyone know what the difference between part 1 and 2 is going to be? I just want to know so I don't end up buying 2 games when it wouldn't be necessary. Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Edit: words 




 You could always just grab Deadpool Classic. Or I started with Merc With a Mouth, which is an amazing collection. 




 It *was* short, but I had fun and that's all that matters. 




 Jack. 




 Despite them obviously going against the canon, I think this game still looks pretty good. As a fan of both the books and the movies, I'm kind of excited for this. 




 I always just assumed they were really sturdy clothes lines in AC. 




 It is. If people don't specify, I just assume its american unless I see a flag or something. 




 I'm not really sure if I'm using the right words, but I meant like of they're doing it to make fun of themselves or something else. 




 Not if it's self aware. 




 It felt like a bag of sand. 




 FO3 and NV as well. 




 I've had the memorized for all Bethesda games since Oblivion. 




 Well, to have a subreddit about the lack of belief in something makes no sense. It's the same as having a subreddit for people who don't like the color blue or don't use Netflix. An anti circle jerk is pretty likely for such a pointless idea. I don't feel superior, I just think that the idea is ridiculous. 




 I think the worst ones are fucking seasonal achievements that you can only get at one point of the year it was put on and then never again. 




 Mine, too. It took forever to delete so I went to turn the TV off and let it do its thing, but turned the Playstation off without thinking. The file got corrupted and promptly took 2.5 hours to delete. 




 *That's* it! You're right. I guess, now, the question is, what does it do to you? 




 Why does that name sound so nasty? 




 Uhhhh, Suzuki X-90, brah! 




 I mean for more games. There just aren't enough on it, at the moment. 




 Dominic Robilliard, previous experience: creative director of an unreleased game with excessive amounts of hype. 




 I agree. I wish I'd waited a little for more games to come out. All I've used my PS4 for lately is Bluray, Netflix, and ACIV. Other than that, it's all PS3 and PC. 




 I organize them by genre (not very well, either), but I like the idea of "not completed," "completed," etc. I might switch to that. 




 I see a dog. 




 That's my favorite model of the STI. I think I just like cars that are a bit more square, I don't know. 




 The SX4 automatic has AWD as well. 




 I think you're replying to the wrong guy. I was just pointing out that 300 was based on a comic book. Looking back on it, I'm not sure if it really added to the argument or anything because the comic book is based on history, but is extremely fictitious. 




 The photo description says that it was also simultaneously stinging him. 




 I just saw you guys with ABR. I'm totally going again. 




 Yeah. Not everybody has the same taste. 




 My two favorite indie games, by far. 




 Yes, but 300 was based on a graphic novel that doesn't claim to be accurate in any way. 




 I agree. I just can't get into it. 




 Jesus, deep water terrifies me.
