 Well if they already like you right off the bat then that's all good, text away all you like. :) I can't speak for all girls, but I seldom ever like a guy right from the start to feel comfortable enough texting them at length before we've gone on a couple of dates and have gotten to know each other better.  

Also, I find that certain nuances in speech get lost in text messages so if you don't know each other well enough yet, some of the stuff you're trying to say won't come across to her the way you meant it, and vice versa.
