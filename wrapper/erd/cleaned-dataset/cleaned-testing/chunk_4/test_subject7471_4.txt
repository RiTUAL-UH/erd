 I run a fairly small subreddit /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). This year's scavenger hunt starts in about 12 hours! 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)


[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

 Every major group of dietary experts in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Any type of diet can be dangerous if not planned appropriately.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day.

Whether or not you or I believe something has no impact on whether or not it is true. 

We should weigh the impact to people who raise and slaughter animals for a living in determining how we ought to behave (we should weigh the impact our actions have on everyone in determining how we ought to behave), but you can't argue in good faith that taking the lives of hundreds of thousands or millions of birds causes less harm than a chicken farmer having to make changes to their career.

 You aren't the only one who is impacted by your choice to eat meat. Animals suffer immensely as a result and meat production places a substantial burden on the environment which impacts everyone else as well. To the extent that your actions are harming others, it is valid for people to speak up about that. 




 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely.

 I think you mean it is more environmentally friendly to buy soy milk. 




 Suppose meat producers have 10% uncertainty in how much meat they should produce, and vegans only make up 1% of the population. They would still, on average, produce less meat as a result of that 1% than they would if that 1% was eating meat.

Vegan diets do not need to be more expensive, but [most effective altruists agree that animal charities are some of the most effective groups we can be donating to for reducing suffering](http://reg-charity.org/effective-animal-charities/) (including human suffering). 




 Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption. 




 The [Center For Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom) (the group behind most of the anti-PETA campaign centered on their website petakillsanimals.com) also runs a website, humanewatch.org, dedicated to cricizing HSUS.

 Omnis cutting animals on the bias! Once again trying to mimic us vegans! 









 [Check out this fish playing sports](http://i.imgur.com/GPUQ1tx.gifv)! 




 I think this is an issue that needs to be approached from a utilitarian perspective. There certainly are benefits that can come from any sort of research, particularly medical research. On the other hand, experimenting on animals almost certainly causes them a great deal of misery. 

We ought to make every effort to minimize the harm caused by any experiment, maximize the expected benefit, and only allow experiments to be conducted if the expected benefit exceeds the expected amount of harm caused. 

That said, we presently tend to have a terrible bias of underestimating the harm our actions cause to non-human animals. At the same time there is no reason why this should only apply to non-human animals either. Humans are much better test subjects for studying human diseases. If we would gain far better knowledge by breeding humans to test upon instead of breeding chimpanzees and both groups would suffer much the same from an experiment, then there is no reasonable excuse for not testing on the humans.
