 It's going to go places! Right now, I have a book in the works, but this universe is next once I'm done. I like the idea of a Nordic looking species though. And I've got you all to thank because without the input, this universe would be scrapped.  




 I want the 'modded' not to be human, but an species that looks like them. The serum thats injected just enhances their physique so they can survive on their homeworld that's incredibly dangerous. The serum doesn't have any deadly side effects, and is only injected once into an new born of the species. It enhances the subject's speed and strength to super soldier levels and accelerates the healing processes of the body. Their hands and feet also become larger and prehensile and grow a layer of thick hair. 

But if injected into a human, the serum can and will kill them unless it's been altered in someway. If given to an exposed, their powers will suddenly overload and become uncontrollable.     




 Yeah, I've seen it. The teenage Evolved could be inspired by superheroes of the past and try to use their abilities to help people or cause destruction. They're powers should be low key, like enhanced intelligence or strength.  




 I like the idea of 'modded' humans or a human-like species. Like if they injected newborns at birth and changed their physiology, similar to the Apex in Starbound. The Evolved I could see becoming major villians with a massive God complex. The exposed could be like metahumans in the new Flash tv show, developing powers, but with downsides.  




 I'm thinking that a race of plant-like aliens would be naturally canivorus, even when raised around other races, they still have a hankering for meat. Another race of humanoids with wings, are naturally airheaded and while they can focus on tasks, they don't really grasp other aspects of human life because they're born to fly. Some species's nature will always shine though.

 




 A species made out of living sound, interesting. I imagine that they might need a special suit to contain themselves or be able to stay cohesive naturally. Or they could forge special collars made of a hyperconductive metal to keep themselves together.   




 Well for starters, the story is about identity. Technology has advanced to the point where 3D printing is like microwaving a pizza and energy weapons are old tech. Space travel is similar to Star Wars, easy to use and accesible to everyone. The story is primarily about finding your identity in the midst of a crisis. The backstory is that the six races fought against a ancient race of robots, The Forbearers. During this 50 year war, civilian lives were torn apart as planets were consumed. The main character is a human named Norm who was raised alongside other orphans from the other races. The aliens are similar in terms of systems of logic, but mortality is different; however, since they were raised in a military orphanage, the human system of morality is prevelant. I just needed help in coming up with ideas for various races. Thanks for the questions though!  




 Hey Redditors, 

I need ya'lls help. I've been thinking about a science fiction story and I've been wondering about races. I know humans will be included, but I need help coming up with about six other races, two of which will become the major antagonists. 
  




 The Chaotic One- A young mage who killed and drew on the power of a ancient god, ascending to near unstoppable power. The only way the newly formed adventurer's guild stopped him was by locking him in a artificially constructed dimension known as The Patchwork World. They then destroyed the portal and destroyed all records of the incident. The only known key to the Patchwork World was placed in rotative custody. 

Mad Jack- A serial killer who appears to have a fake face with a Glasglow grin. It's said that his laughter can kill and that his arms and legs can rotate unnaturally. City Watchmen have seen him multiple times, but can't seem catch him. Has an female accomplice/girlfriend whose name is unknown. Mad Jack's modus operandi seems to be the removal of body parts he doesn't like. The victims all seem to be around the ages of 30-70, men and women, all of which have their genitals, toes and fingers removed, with Orcs having tusks violently ripped out of their jaws. He is still at large. 

Cleric D'Trac- A former cleric in a small town, this mass murderer teleported his entire chapel along with every resident in the town, into a mysterious dimension. Over the course of several weeks, corpses of the towns folk began appearing in major cities, covered in scars of varying size and a foul smelling purple liquid. Some of the bodies seemed to be partially eaten. D'Trac was found in the city of Cactus Bluffs in the early morning hours, with missing right eye. His left ear had been replaced with a partially sutured on Elven ear and his arms and left half of his face was covered in a purple sludge. He was rambling on about the end of all days and how 'we are awash in a bath of sin'. When questioned, D'Trac revealed that he had tried to purify his followers but some 'Didn't listen.' Deemed insane, he has been sent to a maximum security asylum for magic users.

 Congrats! 




 All of dwarves, both male and female, have facial hair to some degree and possess the ability to transform into stone at will. That aside, they're actually very intelligent and their cities are major centers of commerce, and their mine-shafts are a shining example of their architectural skills.

Their culture will be touched upon in the current book I'm working on, but in a nutshell it falls into two categories. 1.Are you a warrior? and 2. If your a mage, get the hell out of our city. Dwarves dislike mages because their abilities are destructive and dangerous, especially when used in mining. Dwarves are also very conservative people, preferring to stick with what they know than go outside the box. As a culture they enjoy beer and have a yearly festival for the beverage. They worship Tal'ton the god of the Forge and Tal'an, his wife the goddess of the mines. They also seem to love adopting human children.     




 It's really fun and well written. Do you think my take on dwarves was a little stereotypical? 




 Cool. I'm taking a more 'Prattchet-eque' approach, wherein I have a new group of characters for each story and have a big crossover to tie them together.  




 So what's the main plotline of the story? 




 The Skyweavers are dragons, right? 




 That's interesting, because every nation has a standing army, but they aren't really racially exclusive. And I haven't really thought about a pantheon, I guess I should do that! 




 Hey Redditors,
Today is a sad day today. I entered my remedial college Math class today and sat down to work on a review. As I read over the problems, I realized to my horror and embarrassment that I couldn't remember what I worked so hard to remember for the entire week. Now, I need you all's help because I've come to the conclusion that these Math courses aren't going to work with my disability. Are there any alternatives or ideas to get around these classes? And how do you guys deal with the anger, frustration and depressiveness that comes with this? 




 Well, at first I wanted to defy that expectation of 'Dark Elves are always surly and psychopathic.' Then i realized that they could be somewhat like the Canadians of Pantaria; friendly and pleasant to everyone, so I stuck with that. 

In-universe the Dark Elves are nice because they're neutral when it comes to warfare. Even though they build a lot of weapons and advanced magical items, they don't use them unless they're adventurers. Over the years, this has made them overall a calm and kind race that has the highest interspecies adoption rate of any other.     









 Dwarves- Depends on their relation to you. Family members tend to be hugged, but only if their human. Dwarven family members great each other by punches to the gut and face. Dwarves great teammates like anyone else, a friendly word and handshake does it just fine. Dwarven culture is centered around strength. The stronger you are, the more valued you are in the family. Mages are looked down upon due to they're less than stellar physical strength.
 

Orcs- Orcs snort at each other. The louder the snort, the more fond they are of you. A short snort means they don't like you. Orcs are a race based around teamwork and food. Most Orcs are great a cooking and value chefs of any caliber. As a result, it's not uncommon to hear snorts coming from Orc kitchens or restaurants.   

Dark Elves- Dark Elves are the friendlist of races and they greet other races with a wave of their hand and the offering of a drink. No matter where you are, NEVER turn down a dark elf's offering of a drink. Dark Elves are all about sharing knowledge, so if you absolutely can't drink, tell them a story.  

Light Elves- High elves insult you due to they're elitist society. If they really like you, the worse the insult. It's not uncommon for a light elf to be found in a pub, swearing at his or her companions. 

Zarians- Zarians will assume your form or voice as a sign that they like you. It's not really a sign of respect, more of a assurance that they acknowledge you enough to say, 'I like you, so I'll become you.' Needless to say, most people find this really creepy. 

Clawtians- They purr. Thats it, they're cat people, what more do you want?

Gnomes- Gnomes will clink their tools together, symbolizing their societal belief of equality among all trades. When with other races, they do this to bond.    
 




 Well, just think about real life, and apply the fantastic. For example, I've created a Community College for wizards. The humor comes from the fact that it's a normal institution but given a fantasy twist.   




 I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.

Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is usless in a phsyical fight. 

Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing. He sucks at hand to hand and relies on trickery and dirty tactics to win. 

Daniel- I know he's a young swordsman, but I need ya'lls help for him in terms of personailty and quirks

Kara is a young woman who is raised by dwarves. As a result, she is capable of defending herself in hand to hand combat and is the only party member who is able to hold off multiple opponents single handily. However, while she is a badass, Kara isn't very good in social situations and due to the dwarven tradition of judo throwing people as a way of saying 'hello', this leads to some really awkward situations.

   




 I would suggest playing Dungeons of Dredmore or read the Discworld series. Both are examples of humor in a fantasy story.  




 "Hey cutie, you awake?" a high pitched male voice asked me. I felt a hand on my shoulder and my eyes fluttered open. I was in what appeared to be a sort of temple, like the Parthenon. Then I screamed when I saw who shook me awake. A guy around my age, with matching features; black crew cut hair, brown skin and green eyes; but wearing what appeared to be a ratty blonde wig, mini-skirt and ill fitting pink t-shirt. His all too familiar eye brows crinkled in confusion.

"Um, you okay hot stuff?" he asked, stepping back. Another guy who looked exactly like him but wearing a stained lab-coat and googles came up behind him and peered at me. 
"Christopher of Earth 2607, are you alright?" he asked in a posh British accent. He waved what appeared to be a metal rod with a yellow crystal at the end over me and smiled broadly. 
"Oh great, your body and psyche survived the transdimensional transference." he announced. 
"Wait, what on Earth is going on?!" I shouted. Then it hit me. 
"Y-you're all me!" I shouted, pointing to the scientist and the man in the miniskirt. They both nodded. 
"Well, more like alternative versions of you. Each on of us is like you in someway, but we're also different." said scientist me. "For example, Marshmallow here is a version of you who is a crossdresser." he said, gesturing to the man in the skirt. "I on the other hand, grew up in London and graduated Oxford with my doctorate in Theoretical Physics." 

"At twenty?" I asked skeptically. Oxford shrugged. "Yes, but on my version of Earth, everyone is a genius, so that's like graduating from preschool." He turned and clapped his hands. A group of around ten different versions of me came out from behind the columns. One version of me was wearing what appeared to be futuristic Roman legionnaire armor and carrying a energy sword. Another was wearing a dark blue hood and body armor, with a bow slung over his back. A few versions weren't even human. One was a lizard-man, wearing jeans and a t-shirt that said 'Go sun yourself'. A raccoon with black fur and green eyes scampered up to me and sniffed at my jeans leg. 

"Aw, hey little fella!" I crooned and extended a hand to scratch his ear but his paw batted my hand away. 
"No touching the merchandise pal!" he growled in a New York accent. I looked back at Oxford in shock. 

"I'm a raccoon in another universe?!" Oxford nodded. 
"Yes, I should've told you that sometimes evolution ensures that humans aren't always the dominate species. Resident of former Earth 56 is a-" 

"Wait, you said former Earth. Why?" I asked, a bad feeling growing in my stomach. Oxford frowned and began rubbing the back of his neck, the same way that I did when I get nervous. 

"Yes, well that's the problem. Our home Earths are being destroyed. I've been able to pull a few of us from other universes to here." He gestured to the building. "A pocket universe. We'd be safe here, but that's not the point. Right now, the entire multiverse is in danger. If too many alternate Earths are destroyed, the multiverse will lose stability." 

"And if that happens everything falls apart?" I finished. Oxford nodded. "Yes, I'm afraid that's what will happen unless we do something fast. We'll need to go to each of our home Earths and begin investigating. If we can find the source of what is causing this 'incursion' we should be able to stop it." I frowned. "Why do you need me?" I asked. "I'm just a colledge student." Oxford smiled. 
"We need you because your the bravest one out of all of us." He handed me a silver bracelet with a red gemstone. "That is a teleport back to here. If anything goes wrong, press that gem and you'll be warped right back." Roman me steped forward and placed his hand on my shoulder. 

"I will take you to my Earth, doppleganger." he said in a voice that was much deeper than mine. I nodded, feeling slightly intimidated. This version of me was six feet tall and build like a linebacker. A glowing 'rip'  appeared in the air before me. I could see a hazy image of some sort of training room, or was it a locker room, it was hard to tell. Oxford cleared his throat. 

"When you are on another world, do not mention anything about your own world. Doing so will have devastating consequences." He said. I nodded and Roman me placed and hand on my shoulder. 
"Come. We have work to attend to." he said, before we both entered the breach.

 If you want to be an adventurer, you need to be able to fight, either with magic or weapons. Even then, you need to be a subordinate under a more experienced adventurer, basically an intern. You get paid crap, you get thrown into deadly situations and you most likely will wind up with some broken bones or a magical ailment. You still there and not running off in terror? Wow, you must be pretty brave Intern ZakTH. So basically adventures are dolled out in order of importance. Is there a massive creature rising up out of the ocean, attacking the coast? Higher priority than a goblin raid on a small town.The Guild's are typically sponsored by cities in order to have the adventuer's help to defend them if needed. Street crime is off limits though and the City Watch (police officers) will deal with that.  

Freelancers will usually take care of low level adventures, like finding lost trinkets or clearing out bandits. They don't get paid much, but people tend to like them more than the big name adventures because they're willing to help.       




 Well, for starters, Pantaria's magic is like physics. It's a core part of the world. Mages, are people born with the ability to tap into and wield magic. Wizards are born with the ability to control magic, but they can't tap into like mages, so they use objects that are enchanted (charged) with magic to perform feats. Witches are exclusivly women and some gay men who must use potions and ingredients to cast spells. Warlocks are magic users who have an affinity for magic that is taboo, such as being a living voodoo doll, mind flaying or summoning demons at will. Their powers are also bound to them and it's hard for a Warlock to use other types of magic. All magic users must be witty to a degree.

Magic has rules in-universe, as it is a physical law. Some forms of magic like typical firebolts, icebolts and polymorphism are soft scale magic. However, hard magic comes in when things like summoning eldritch beings from other planes are involved.  

Adventuring isn't that profitable unless your with The Guild of Adventures, a team of adventurer's who get a reasonable salary based on the fact that they take on big name cases. They're so big that they can afford a headquarters building in the nicer district in FoxCliff; a major city. A freelance adventurer might make enough for a apartment if they undertook around ten missions a day. What really draws young adventurer's in is the prospect of finding a massive amounts of treasure and fame. The entire industry is meant to be similar to being a You-tuber, but with more of a risk of death.  




 Yo Redditors!
I'm working on a new book and figured you guys could help me out by fleshing out the world. Basically, it's set in a middle ages themed  world where magic is like science and adventuring is an industry. The primary characters are adventuring interns. I need to make this quick, but AMA!  




 Pantaria has tons of magic types, like divisions of science. I have golem crafting, advanced golem crafting, dimension travel, deity magic, standard elemental magic, necromancy, summoning magic, hedge wizardry, Booze wizardry (yeah, it's just what you think. Great at parties), bibilomancy, time travel, dark arts, grey arts, white arts, warlock and witch magic, zoological magic, physics magic and potion brewing/enchanted object creation. 
Magic is a primary force in the world, so it's grown over time, much like science. It started with basic elemental manipulation, but some people are born with an affinity towards on type of magic.
