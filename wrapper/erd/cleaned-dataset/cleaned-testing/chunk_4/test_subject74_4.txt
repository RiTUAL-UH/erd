 I'm looking for advice on how to improve my current make up or what to buy and how to use it based on my features and skill level which is very beginner...The first two pictures are me with make-up the last is without...I currently use: 

foundation: rimmel London stay matte primer, Maybelline dream fresh bb, and an organic brand loose powder.

eye: bonne bell eyeliner in black, cover girl eyeenhancers shadow in sombre relzadora which is white with sparkle, covergirl lashblast fusion.

brows: flamingo brow pencil in light brown...its an off brand Asian company I believe.  









 Mine have gone back after decent sized stretches, I stretched mine 3 times so far...The first time they shrunk back to 8g in 2 days...the second time they shrunk back to 8g in 3 days...and I'm currently still on the third stretch...Actually I went to a 00g all 3 times...it is possible for certain people...everybody has different skin elasticity and heals differently.  




 That sounds awesome! Thank you!  




 Do you think your friend would be willing to consider taking on doing a strangers? lol. I'm having no luck, and I'm not talented enough to do them myself. 




 Does anyone on this page know how or know someone who does... that is located near or in Halifax, Nova Scotia? 




 Thank you! :) 




 I didn't have any help what so ever, it took me 3 hours the first time...But, I've gone back and put in double elastics so I'd say 4-4.5...lol 




 Hmmm, that is odd. And thank you! :) I definitely will, I've gotten so many compliments since then that I honestly can't even believe it...People I don't even know have stopped me in person just to tell me they look good. I really appreciate your comment, its really nice to receive more positivity than negativity. :) 




 I doubt theres enough people for it to catch on, and I'm glad you're not...However, I posted them here and received down votes etc. And was basically told I would continue to be down voted just a heads up...ahah. I joined r/FancyFollicles  




 Thanks! And yes, they are...They're handmade by Heather at Divinity Dreads. She's amazing...And I went with the synth route because I have very short hair at the moment, I have thin, straight hair, and I wasn't sure if they would suit me so I thought a non committed approach would work best for me! And these locs are a million times nicer than anything I could achieve naturally...mine would look like braids 




 Its okay, these are not dread falls though...They're extensions that braid in and they are natural colors so they blend with my normal hair...They essentially look like dreads. 




 I'm pretty sure having synth dreads doesn't make me goth...you're either really rude or a frigging trollll. They literally look like real dreads except I'm honest enough to say they're not.... 




 Well, the shampoo seems to be sulfate free...and actually after buying the conditioner I stopped using it almost immediately because the one I bought doesn't say its cone or sulfate free...it only says color and parabens...But thank you for the input! :)  









 Is this shampoo free from enough chemicals(parabeans, silicone, color, etc) that its good to use on dreads or instead of going shampoo free? 









 I guess I could've phrased it a lot better...but I posted to a fitness sub reddit because I was hoping I could get better advice that way. If I just wanted to feel better about myself I would've posted something to facebook or somewhere similar.  




 Actually I was wondering if it is the best way to measure my fat to weight ratio and what range I fall under. It is not about feeling better about myself emptily. I am still exercising and trying to lose the weight and I intend to continue with it. No matter what response I got I intended to keep exercising. I honestly just want to know the best way to calculate this sort of thing so that I can measure my progress...Because there's really no physical difference yet as far as muscle etc.  




 Thanks! :) I really do want to work on tone and building muscle so I will continue to try but I feel much better about my current weight now.
