 Fucking idiots.  




 Seems like we have a shape shifting multiplying criminal out there, giving the fine African American people a bad name. 




 Six million, suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. 




 We have nothing to gain from jumping into a 3,000 year old fucking mess.

Again.

Evac civs and nuke the whole fucking mess. But we woulnt do that and you wanna know why. 

Money.

The cost of war is high and someone always makes money from it.

Dont go shitting on Obeeze (i dont like him ether) he inherited this fucking mess that we created and he is just doing what he is told. 




 So I take it you didnt wanna see my deck? Man no one ever wants to look at my deck. :( 




 Hey ladies what do you think of my [deck](http://imgur.com/yrO6T5x)?
 




 Every damn time. 




 First off no. 

In most states you are only required to present ID when you are being detained. Furthermore you can only be detained when the police have reasonable articulable suspicion that you have/will commit a crime. 

Secondly you should give a shit.The Fourth Amendment [is right here.](http://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) You should go ahead and read up on it.  




 So searching people with no PC/RAS and clearly violating the fourth amendment is fine with you? 









 No problem friend, enjoy the game. 




 Hold on to pixie. You can fuse her but make sure you keep what she is fused into. 




 You can do which ever you want P4 is not as strict as P3 is in terms of S.Links. I would do hermit since it helps out in dungeons. Also not to spoil anything but in the late game you have time to work on S.Links a whole lot.  




 What is it with this guy and withdrawing?

 [Here you go.](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Persona_%28series%29) 




 It's a copy pasta.  




 I dont think it is, but if it is Id like a mod to take in down instead of ban me. 




 Chie is a fucking slut. Just imagine the amount of sausage she had between those lips. She was probably the town bike before you came around and she was instantly lusting after your salami next.

Her phonenumber is probably all over public toilets with the annotation that she's willing to do anything for a beefbowl.

And remember those 3 guys from her S rank? As soon as you enter the train to go back home those guys probably rape her and NTR the shit out of her, turning her into a sexslave so they don't have to pay for the meat to take turns on her 














 Im just gonna be the one to come out and say it, and since I never post here I dont care if im banned.


FUCK YOU /u/el_chupacupcake. How much fun is it being a mod now that everyone knows how fucking full of shit you are, and how much people hate you?

Also I hope you wore a condom you fuck.

 




 [Dont make me say it.](http://imgur.com/wDY7XwE) 




 This needs to be a web series. Every other week have a different celebrity come in trying to pawn something.  




 They fukin wot m8? 




 Funny you should say that. It's gone from the archive. If you really wanna see how deep the rabbit hole goes, go on /v/ right now and look for a thread. Ive been following this for about two days now and it really is disgusting not for her sleeping around but the state of gaming "journalism". 




 Dont you mean looking down? 




 This is absolutely disgusting. Kotaku has no journalistic integrity what so ever (not that we didn't already know this). Im glad all this is coming out it shows the important problems with modern day game journalism. 

Edit*

 Welp guess no fappin for me tonight. Thanks OP. 




 As someone who has lived in Columbus I have to ask this. Have you ever ran into Mr. Help Is On The Way?

And now im sad. That guy was awesome :( 




 k 




 The Raid. 




 Liam still has his child-like optimism, He is only 14 after all. Give it a few years and he will become a bitter, cynical, balding, ginger just like Pat. 




 P3 = Grunge "Look at how dark I am!"
P4 = Scooby Doo "Lets solve this mystery gang!" 









 Great cop.  




 A Modest Proposal changed my view of baby back ribs. 




 This just in. No shit. 









 I love that girl.  




 Ok I just wanna clear something up real quick. The group Anonymous is far different than your run of the mill /b/tard. 














 Nanako is the killer :) 




 Go buy it nerds. Also Mitsuru best girl. 









 No words. Just sads :( 




 Because of public opinion. Most people only think of guns as bad.  




 Also [this](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/swat-team-barges-assaults-children-smashes-everything-whoops-wrong-house/) article has more from the father. The only drugs found was a small amount of marijuana. 









 And this is why I pirate. Fuck uplay fuck origin and most of the time fuck steam. GOG or Pirate bay all the way. 




 Pretty good stuff by all party's involved.  




 That is not true for OP, we all know the littlest things set them off. 




 Hi. Heard you were in here talking some shit. 




 What does Google's dick taste like? 














 Getting mad at people for being mad about people who are mad about what a person said seems pretty retarded.  




 Txt him [this](http://imgur.com/ABR3uRP) picture.

Or If he doesnt have a smartphone just txt him an say

"ay bby want sum suk? 




 Reminder in America marijuana is on the same level as heroin and meth. 




 [Hate to tell you this, but...](http://imgur.com/GElzt23)

But in all seriousness though. When it first came out I liked it a lot, but after I tried giving it a second play through a few years ago the bad out weighed the good for me.
 
* The beginning is a huge draw fest.
* The enemy's level with you so there is no point grinding.
* You can exploit the junction system.  
* The story shit's itself.
* SPAAAAAAAACE.
* No Quistis sex scene. 
* Whatever.

It does have a few good things going for it.

* Triad 
* Comfy music
* Some really good side quests
* Very nice cut scenes.
* Quistis 

But that's just my opinion on it. I maybe be biased because I love 7 and 9 so much but thats just how I feel.

 Yeah but he wants to play video games. 




 Guys hear me out, follow me on this. What if we are all just backward backwards mans.  




 Hey Shadows,

My name is Yu, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-life's who spend every second of their night looking at the midnight channel. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any S-Links? I mean, I guess it's fun not being able to face yourselves because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on deviant-art.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much null to everything. I was captain of the drama club, and center on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "fuse shit teir persona"? I also get straight A's thanks to my max knowledge, and have a banging hot waifu (She just made another commercial; Shit was SO splash). You are all shadows who should just hama yourselves. Thanks for listening.

 Naked woman. Red Canyon. I see what you did there dev's. 




 This just in Russia has depleted it reserves of fucks.  




 Have you ever herd the words Space Jam? 




 Pizza?  




 The war on drugs. 




 Don't remind me. I'm about this close to saying fuck this and moving to Arizona.  




 God I hope so. I moved out here from Ohio where you can open carry all day and buy guns at swap meets. Too no open carry ever and if you want a gun enjoy all these hoops we have set up for you.  




 No. :) 




 Burnett could face up to life in the prison on the rape charge. The attempted capital murder charge could carry up to a life sentence if decided by jury. If it went to a judge, the sentence would range from no less than 20 years up to "one day less than life."

What is a one day less than life sentence?
 




 Hey Pat you dropped [this](http://imgur.com/h4hM8fW). 




 /b/ here. You're welcome. 




 Israel does not give a fuck about those dead teens. Hamas is just a convenient scape goat for them to kill Palestinians. All because "God" said that land is theirs. Whats even worse is that my country supports and helps pay for genocide. I'm so fucking sick of paying taxes for this bullshit. I barely make enough too support myself and my daughter but my government will give billions to Israel. Fuck this country, and fuck Israel. 

Any Canada bros wanna take us in?

 Ah again with the squeaky shoes.
