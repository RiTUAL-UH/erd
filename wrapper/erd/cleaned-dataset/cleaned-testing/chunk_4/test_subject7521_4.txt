 I'm currently struggling with a similar situation, and I can tell how she feels about me; but I am uncertain as to how I feel about her. It's a horrible feeling to think that you may be leading someone, who actually cares for you, on a fruitless journey, and how you may have to end the relationship sooner so they don't get hurt as much. 




 Lol I learned that with my very first girlfriend.  




 That Ace Ventura gif made me lose it XD 




 That was quite the topic change...
