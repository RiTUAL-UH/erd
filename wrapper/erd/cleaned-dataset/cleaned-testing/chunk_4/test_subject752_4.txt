 Thank you, that's a good point, when they're like old and their kids google their parents this is going to come up and require a bit of explaining.. 




 Thank you, that wasn't explained very well. (Or at least i've only had 1 cup of coffee this morning..) 




 Sorry, does someone mind mind explaining this? - Did they "miss out" due to the injunction lapsing?  




 That's pretty average! 




 I agree, but in the same breath sometimes takes competing formats to determine the best winner for the consumer. However the obvious question is can such an 'alien' technology survive the invariable comparison between 2 proprietary formats? 

(As someone who sold blank DVD and DVD player/recorders during the DVD -R +R format can tell you, that was bloody confusing enough for consumers!) 




 Thanks Op! It's worth pointing out the halo around the lights could easily be caused by finger grease on the lens on the m8.  




 How do you miss this during the editing process?? 
I haven't come across this *yet.* 




 Yes! And that's made me think of another: A whole article on "user comments"! 

Let's let the users make up the click bait for us!?  




 I'm so not surprised though. Here's what I've noticed:

Spelling mistakes.

Advertising masquerading as "news articles" 
 
Extremely biased articles.
 
Very piss poorly researched articles. 
(Aka: people who abuse the party X when a quick Google forces to light they're actually lying through their teeth.)

Poorly executed articles. 
(Aka: look out for rampant  weed X which should be reported to MAF, but didn't bother to include a photo)

Any more examples anyone can think of?  




 Yes, that makes sense. 




 Maybe Samsung are betting upon this?  




 I hope someone like Anandtech takes the time to run a comparison. 




 Mint. I fingered one at the local telecom store, very light!  




 No, most users it will be fine. However this may be a purchasing decision some take into account.
However factor in 1 minute of 4k is around 1GB. So if you have some guy showing off to his mates and you're quickly going run out of room :-P
 




 Surprising really. I had a quick Google with A few different keyword variants with no hits. Even this was difficult to find. 




 Yeah, 9gb is quite a whack of data. In the same breath though 23gb should be adequate for "most" users. 




 Yes, (I believe so anyway) they release it in [gibibyte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) rather than gigabyte. 




 Yeah, the original news article stating users could do so was wrong (misinformed perhaps). 




 I would presume so?  




 Thanks for the comparison. But the note has an sd slot supporting sdxc so not that much of an issue.  




 I couldn't find a comparison with 32gb, but here's a link to show 16gb devices (from last year)

[This is the only 1 I could find. Oddly enough..](http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/phone-storage-compared-samsung-s4-still-in-last-place/) 




 The fact they're going retail in September is phenomenal. 

/r/Android users have speculated whether Ara would get if the ground, this company had gone way past that step. 


They must have realised there's a market for swappable hardware. 














 Indeed. From the looks of it it was almost identical!  









 This is gold! Oh HTC...  




 [Air New Zealand as well!](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1 objectid=11424236) 









 Thank you so much!!  




 Snap all the way man. (even after being bought by 2Degrees) Cancel your contract and move. 

I don't know if this helps man, but keep asking to talk to the manager. Be really nice and polite and just keep escalating. Tell them when the invariably say you can't - "That's absolutely fine, I understand you've told me I can't speak to a manager. I will hang up now and phone right back to attempt to speak to someone who is able to put me through to a position of power." I've had to use this a few times with Vodafone, works every time to get you through to someone who can help. Seriously. 




 Actually this reminds me of the (instant kiwi?) ad takeoff - the batsman puts something (his cup?) down and smacks it for six.

Anyone else remember this Ad? 




 Furthermore the mall indicated they had called it out over the loudspeakers for 30 minutes prior to towing it. So his story really doesn't add up. 









 As I dragged my Red bin to the curb last night it occurred to me it was probably 50% baby poo.
So there's that. 




 FTFY: "The team that got second best in the world for the first time ever." 




 Iris security would be nice. 









 Well spoken James. 




 Nice. 

Looks like a very well rounded device, they've addressed quite a few complaints about the S5 - speaker placement, camera quality, build quality, fingerprint scanner, heartrate monitor, TouchWiz GUI.

And just improved upon what makes Samsung devices really nice - Screen quality.

I'm sure they implemented some wizardry with the Exynos and the AMOLED as there was an article in /r/android last night fron Engadget a while ago. They implemented stuff like ignoring refreshing pixels that don't change based upon what's on the screen, which helped up to 10% better battery life on the S5, little doubt this has helped the battery last so long despite the bump in pixels on the S6.
 









 Seriously you need to taste this.. 




 I think most of it is conjencture. Who knows this could all be a enormous joke for more ratings?! /s/ Joking aside I'm sure he has enemies in the BBC who would love to see him gone, and this would not have helped his case in the slightest.  




 It really does, you're right. 

Funny how even though he really can be a thug, whether on purpose of because he has a fantastic PR assistance (probably both) he really is a loveable rogue really. 




 True. God. What have we created.. 




 I think you are right. God he must have one hell of an ego. 




 Yeah, he's allegedly said he will fight this, I presume so he can get a better exit package.
I daresay he will cream it from this?

But you're right, he's put his friends in a very tough spot. Is Top Gear bigger than Jeremy, or Jeremy bigger than Top gear? 




 He can be, but he's built up one hell of a very loyal following in his career. 

The question is will James and Richard follow through with their suggestion they will also leave? 




 Pretty much.. 














 That's some ballsy shit. 

Stabbed 16 times and still have the energy and intact mental facilities to be that quick witted, then to survive as well!? 




 Just a dash cam app and a windshield mount for my phone. Dailyroads voyager, free from Android play. 

Not the best wide angle like good ones, but high quality allows me to zoom in on plates.

Good reviews and footage.  




 He killed the dog too...  




 There's a lot of fucking angry people in Canterbury, this is probably going to happen more often. 

Seriously I watch a few dash cam  videos from chch, as well as post my own, just from my own experience. Fucking crazy how angry some people get.

 That's quite a novel idea. 




 I looked that up, but nothing came up so it must be a different phrase, but it figures there is even a phrase for stuff like that. 




 That makes sense. 
Thanks for the laugh too, I suppose that's actually half the issue - we're almost programmed to find most things to do with toilets amusing, which probably doesn't help.

 




 Indeed. 
Perhaps at this stage the majority of the audience doesn't want film/show makers to use them, and that's set the line in the sand. 




 For the record the commerce commission investigated SKY and basically determined that yes, while they have a monopoly they are acting lawfully as they are basically the only player on the block so can charge whatever they damn well want.

 Makes sense again for some shows, but I'm sure it could be used in some TV shows to great affect. 




 The school are totally within their rights to withdraw the little shits. A sports team **represent the school they are competing for** surely this gives the school the rights to be able to chose their representatives?


Can I point out [Rod Stewarts son did this in America and arrested for doing this a couple of days ago..](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3007112/Rod-Stewart-s-son-Sean-jail-bailed-charged-riding-luggage-carousel-restricted-area-Miami-International-Airport.html) So it's some serious shit they did, had they been older or perhaps not on a school trip chances are they would have been arrested and released with a warning at least. 




 I see what you did there.. :D 

No, your video games comment is fair enough, you don't expect such realism such video games (Can you imagine.. "Press A to take a piss")

But from gritty movies, i thought there would be more of a use to draw people into the realism? 




 That sounds like a reasonable explanation.  




 Is it too taboo? 

Or is there some sort of regulatory requirement that would make the shows PG+ when a toilet is mentioned, or shown?

Is it considered too low brow to mention anything toilet related in shows or movies?

Or perhaps it's done to simply speed things along?

What do people think? Should we have more realistic toilet behaviours displayed on our televisions and theatres? 




 That's a pretty shit phone review.

For a start  "As an example, with a day that was full of gaming and picture taking, the battery died just past the 10 hour mark." how completely unscientific can you be? Couldn't they at least posted SOT or battery stats of this?

And then in the "positives" putting "Battery life just above average" that doesn't sound like a positive to me.

And the camera review, what a fucking joke he didn't even clean the camera lens, you can tell by the massive light ghosting in the bar shots there's grease on the lens.

Feels like this phone was handed to someone who's owned a few smart phones, felt like they were a pro in reviewing and went to the bar, had a few beers and wrote this up in an hour or two.

Not impressed. 




 But why would we feel bad?

They are still the only aluminium and glass high end phone available in most markets, why change what works?
The reviews for the latest device aren't anywhere near as scathing as the S5 reviews (Remember everyone's favourite catchup for bagging the S5? -"Evolution over revolution") so while it's not the best move they played it safe.

They may not have Samsung's mega dollars to be able to release an entirely new device within the short life cycle that people are coming to expect from cellphone makers these days, and why would they?
The market responded [favourably](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=2498.TW#symbol=2498.TW;range=) to the move, so actually they've done quite well. 




 Well said. 




 Hold on there, I'm not talking an escalator- I'm talking a luggage carousel - you know the type that the baggage handlers put the luggage on. 

For a start [they can easily trap fingers and hands](http://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/08/12/1079731/naia-worker-gets-hand-stuck-baggage-conveyor) and then they took it through to an OSH and security nightmare, that provides direct access to the tarmac. At every airport I've ever been there are signs saying don't ride the carousel, and don't go through the curtain.. 

I would expect a 5 year old to do this, not a ***16 and 17 years old*** 









 Makes sense. I guess if you have enough money time doesn't really factor in to things as much as I thought they did. 




 Doing it when you've been explicitly told not to do anything stupid due to what happened last year- Last year the group burned a shape of a penis in the ground, trashed the joint they were staying, and burnt "SBC" in the ground. 
[Source](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9910813/St-Bedes-students-misbehave-at-rowing-regatta)

So to further horse around and they knew the school wasn't going to take it lightly. 




 Yes, purely based upon previous observation.
However, now the reviews have come out, peoples tone has changed significantly. 




 It wasn't in the beginning.
I think it got worse after the rest of the reviews came out.... 




 Thank you. Truly thank you.
This really surprises me I would not have thought 1 year even from conception to product would be nearly enough time!

If I could afford to I would guild you for being the only person to back up what you're saying with some background knowledge.

Radically different takes 2 years - so you reckon the S6 edge has been in the works for 2 years? Or were they just eye watering quick at the R D for it?  




 Why? 

How long does it take then? 

Do you know for 100% certain it only takes 1 year?

Why are you assuming they can do it quicker?

Edit: Call me delusional but no have no proof backing it up? Proof provided. 




 That makes sense.
I was going off what I know, and what I presumed to me *should* take that long. Why so many people took it upon themselves to hate me for it is so utterly beyond me. 

Without anyone able who knows the process we may never know for certain.
 




 Then that was my bad.  




 Not sure if you're being sarcastic? 

..They are assholes...

They knowingly took it upon themselves to enter an area that was off limits while representing a school they attend. 
At the very least they had no thoughts for how this might reflect upon the school, let alone the poor teacher/aide who was suppose to be watching them.

Let's say, worst case scenario from their little trip- they could have shut the whole fucking airport down for 30 minutes inconveniencing hundreds of people. 

They are Assholes for being inconsiderate little pricks for the purpose of thirty seconds of personal amusement.  




 Frustrated that people clearly don't realize how long HTC have been working on this phone, and that compounds my level of disappointment in them for fucking it up. 









 Thank you. Prepare your Asshole for the downvotes, but you are sooooo right. 




 This isn't "catastrophic" but it is a joke.

The S6 uses both the CPU and storage speed boost for really nifty things like increasing the camera boot time to allow you to open it very quickly with only a couple taps of the home button. 
A slower processor and this would not be possible.

Also the mobile industry falls heavily upon benchmarks, and graphs to show better phone, the majority of people never really play with their flash new device for any more than a few minutes in stores, so rely on the internet to prove why it should buy 1 device over another.

A difference of 23000 *benchmark* points most certainly will pull those with no brand loyalty to the faster device. 

There is no other draw card HTC have here. (And don't you dare mention design, if they wanted design they would have already bought the M8 over the S5. You can't panda to the same audience for 3 years running (aluminium and glass) without nearing the saturation point in a lot of markets. 

HTC needed a "Wow factor" and this chipset is not it. 




 I'm loving the denial in this thread:

"It's not going to make a shit phone, it's an awesome phone, it's **just** running a shit processor."

"It's not going to be any slower than a Samsung S6, benchmarks don't mean anything in the real world."

"They didn't throttle the chip, it's just software tweaks."

HTC have had YEARS to play with the 810.. (Seriously, phone development takes at least 2+ years from drawing board to anything close to fruition. Even when you're only tweaking the previous iteration)

And this is the *best* they could come up with!?

Go on, downvote me, you know damn well I'm right. 




 Yes, a very accurate title there, "Timeless design" as it's same god damn design every time you look at it! 




 Yeah.. He completely and utterly ignores the fact consumers are clamouring for bigger, brighter, more pixel dense screens, while also screaming for faster, more powerful processors all while browsing Facebook.

Battery technology  Average consumer demands 




 Yay for a Government which allows this! /S

Edit: Thank you kind Redditor for explaining this. 




 Maybe these kids are trying to be like their hero Gerry Brownlee maybe.  




 No, it's an integrated school. Thought that too. 
Not sure what the different is.. 




 Thanks, did a search for St Bede's, it didn't come up. 




 This headline makes me happy. 

We need significantly more people who think like him in every major election everywhere around the world. 




 The US just confiscated a $180 million boat shipment of cocaine from Colombian drug traffickers... To be destroyed by the Customs Authorities. Slowly.. Gram by gram.. 




 Oh I wonder who could  be behind this... /s 




 Yeah. You've pretty much got it.  




 *Slow clap* 
























 Perhaps this will succeed for the same reason as custom pc's (alienware, home built etc) still exist in a world of computer/laptop companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP etc. 
 




 No, somewhat unbelievably.

I bought a new battery which actually got worse SOT, then realised it was for an i9505, not an i9506, even then I got 3 hours SOT.  




 I now understand why in Far Cry 4 they ask you like 5 times if you're sure want to fight the Honey Badger.. 




 I would disagree, I reliably got 12 hours standby + 4 hours SOT with my S4. 
And by reliably I mean for 6 plus months this was my consistant benchmark. 
If I got less than that I knew and hunted down the Application responsible.

When it dropped consistantly to 3 hours SOT plus 12 hours standby I did a factory reset and that took it back up to 4 hours.. So the key to any good measure is reliability, SOT is able to be a reliable benchmark. 




 As would I, the frustration however arises from when minorities are allowed concessions that the majority does not feel are warranted by their requirements, or religious beliefs.

This potentially stems from a few things:

* Misunderstanding the core religious laws which require consumer law to be changed in order to comply. 
* Frustration at the laws passed for religious reasons that allow a religious person a significant concession while still applying the same law heavily upon non-believers.

Surely you can understand the frustration when one must relinquish their tweezers, while a potentially sharp metal object designed to protect oneself is allowed on board without question due to ones religious beliefs. 




 Thank you, that makes sense, as mentioned above I had 3 lemonade mixed with flavoured vodka, the end of each drink was significantly more bitter/tart tasting than the rest of the drink. So what you're saying makes sense. 

Thank you kind redditor for your response, I'lll use a cosy next time to drink the drink cooler to avoid the bitterness! 




 Thank you very much, I was drinking lemonade with feijoa flavored Vodka, the last gulp of all 3 drinks were quite bitter compared to the remainder of the drink. 

I thought it was due to the ethanol sinking to the bottom of the water, but thank you for explaining it's mixed throughout the drink. I think in my particular circumstance /u/MoltenSlag has hit the nail on head in that it's due to the fizzy escaping the drink, coupled with a rise in temperature, makes sense.

Thank you kind redditor for your reply. :) 




 Yup, you can only park on your side of the road, not against oncoming traffic. 

Also this: 
https://www.practice.co.nz/pass-planner/intermediate/multi-lane-roads/turning-into-one-way-streets.aspx

Except instead of going into their own lane, everyone will go into the lane furtherest away.  









 No worries! Really love showing off nz to the world, we have stunning scenery, and if you're a night owl the most picturesque impossibly clear night skies imaginable. Especially in the lower south island.

Oh one more thing, while it's legal for 2 drivers to turn left and right respectively into a multi laned road (each turn into road path nearest to them) most drivers cut wide and turn into the other lane, so best to only go if you're certain they will turn into their lane. Sorry if that doesn't make sense I can draw you something.  




 Well.. There have been shit battery figures quoted and thermal issues, hopefully fix the thermal issues and battery life may increase?  




 Does anyone need to be reminded of the bloody Adidas All black jersey debacle? Rebel were selling the All Blacks Jersey for $220 NZD despite the fact it could be bought online for half that, the supplier- Adidas refused to back down on having a ludicrously high cost price and basically told kiwis you will pay what I fucking want to charge you cunts. No shut up and give me your money.

[Adidas New Zealand refuses to reduce its wholesale price of the All Blacks jersey but says the move by retailers to reduce their price is "good for consumers".](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/5411809/Adidas-gets-a-mauling-over-All-Blacks-jersey)

 Good to hear! :) 




 Don't know, but I sometimes have to be the asshole that taps their brakes and makes the dude behind them brake hard.

For the record, 99% of the time this results in them realizing they're too close and backing off, so I suspect they're driving on autopilot, and it takes manual control (braking to avoid hitting me) to make them realize they're driving like a douche and back off. 




 I'll always upvote Bender quotes. 




 Indeed. All things considered though, actually putting it past parliament is a major hurdle.   




 Don't think so......... 




 Haha, good point! 









 Too true - reminds me of a apt quote worth keeping in mind - 
"If something is free, you're the product." 




 Couldn't agree more to be honest. I drive from Bishopdale to Riccarton and back twice a day and if I had a dollar for every red light runner, every stop sign runner, every speeder or every queue jumper (using the right hand lane to jump 2 cars ahead despite free flowing traffic.) then I would not be typing this, cause I'd be a on a fucking boat in the Bahama's somewhere sipping a mojito. 




 Haha, if enough people can make "Jedi" the religion on an NZ census I'm sure you can get away with this. 




 We have deceptive times on Google between major landmarks, allow +1 hour for most journeys on your GPS.

Most of our motorways out of the major arterial routes are unlit, unpoliced and barely maintained so require constant vigilance. 

We do sometimes have wandering livestock, but not very often.

And unfortunately you have to contend with the average Kiwi Driver who greatly over estimates their driving abilities. 

Basic rules to be mindful of: 

* Do NOT expect people to stop at STOP signs.
* Do not EVER expect people will see you on the road.
* Expect pedestrians to not look before stepping out on the road. 
* Expect drivers to not hear your horn (wearing headphones while driving is a common passtime.)
* Do not expect to just 'find a park' any where, at any point in time, always give +10 minutes to find a park in most central areas.
* Expect drivers to tailgate badly (Seriously, NZ drivers love acting like the human equivalent of hemorrhoids. 
* Expect drivers will speed up during passing lanes (120+km/h)
* Further to the above expect drivers to be driving slowly on the motorway (80-90km/h)
* Do no expect drivers to indicate
* Expect drivers to pull out without looking 
* When approaching a T intersection expect cars coming around the corner to cut into your lane
* Basically expect dangerously
* Not obeying Stop signs, Give way signs, or any kind of sign for that matter
* Driving dangerous driving at all times. 
* Be surprised when Drivers obey the road rules
* Etc..

Edit: I'm from Chch and I encounter the above on a daily basis and I only travel about an hour or around 35km a day. 




 If the people grabbing the keys are indiscriminately grabbing them from extremely bad drivers, why hasn't anyone grabbed the keys from a NZ'er yet?

Edit: I am allowing for the possiblity this does or has occured and no-one's reported it? 




 Oh I see - he checked the wrong side first? Kinda makes sense - throw in an unknown environment, I think we can both agree it just makes for a recipe for disaster.. 




 Gimmicks? So you're happy with the same technology being used for many years with no enhancement, no refinement, no changes from a 15 year old design?

Yes, they re expensive, so is R D. He could pump out the same old shit as everyone else at the same price as everyone else, but instead he pays vast sums of cash to engineers to do make it better. 

While you agree or disagree with him as a man, you have to appreciate someone who looks at an age old design and tells themselves "I can do this better." 




 Indeed. 




 I agree with your point, although even your example has a tinge of arrogance - only looking one way when we're all taught to look both ways regardless.

If your assessment is correct, and complacency and drivers revert to a 'comfortable' level of driving on our roads then I can't help but wonder how/if we can even approach this from an education standpoint, I guess the arrows on the road are a good step, but a quick test (as many propose) would quickly become a distant memory when passing the 15th dead possum on the road from Nelson to Twizel, rendering any skills learnt at arrival void as one slips back to their standard routine.

How can you even stop this? I honestly don't think you can. (Except for the billboards advising tired drivers etc to pull over - but if they can't read English or have a tight schedule they won't care?) 




 Just attempting to curry favour with the Sikh population perhaps?
