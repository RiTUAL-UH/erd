 Captain America Winter Soldier made me appreciate First Avenger more the 2nd time watching it 




 I was looking at the current list and both "Furious 7" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" are both in it (and still climbing). 
I'm seriously rooting for The Force Awakens to get into the top 10. 
Do you reckon it will? + i'd love Spectre to get there too but im not sure that it will.  




 Skyfall is the best Bond film ever, Casino Royale is awesome but Skyfall is just plainly better IMO 




 I thought she was good in Tomorrowland and just thought she's make a good Oracle. I can imagine her in the glasses and wheelchair, but i know that comic readers will have a different opinion to me. 
what do you guys think of the idea? 




 that was fucking awful 




 for me 

Paul Blart 2
Big Game
Wild Card 
Taken 3
 etc. 
 




 between 60-80%  




 Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End

there is no best IMO  




 Chronicle  




 Home Alone 4
