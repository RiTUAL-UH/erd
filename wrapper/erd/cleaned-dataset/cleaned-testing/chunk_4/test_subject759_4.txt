 now, im not a bartender but isnt that, like.. its job?

still, definitely a r/perfectfit :) 




 mmmm tree blood... plus like, fruit is flower fetuses, no? or no wait, flower genitals? SOMEthing delicious. 




 no no you're missing the point; if we make fun of the drunk drivers maybe they WONT die in drunk driving accidents; it will help them change their ways! that or the younger generation will grow up really believing in how stupid it is, because they will get made fun of it they ever did it. we're not making fun of the families who have already suffered; we're not monsters! 




 okay yep thats a good call; but in that case i prefer the scrubby things instead of a washcloth, or an exfoliating face/body wash. i feel like a washcloth doesnt scrub hard enough somehow; so apparently for me its either no scrub just soap; or super scrub shiny face styles... i never thought about this before but its strange and true. 




 no, i wash my ass with face soap.

nah but really, the soap is clean; thats why its soap. as long as you rinse after using so theres no hairs or whatever. 




 this is a tough one: my heart says GO FOR IT but my head says make sure you know what you are doing before you go messing  around in that little kids life; he should be her and your priority when it comes to any kind of life decisions. dont go in and out of his life needlessly, it sounds like he has it rough enough as it is.

other than that it sounds like you could be good for her and it would be worth having this kind of conversation with her if she feels the same way. 




 i think this doesnt always work: i dont know if its because they dont update at the same rate but im pretty sure links ive already voted on my computer still appear on mobile unvoted. conversely, however, i think sometimes voted app links appear purple on the site. i might be wrong though, i wasnt paying attention until now.. 




 pretty sure comment karma is straight garbage; link karma or GTFO
