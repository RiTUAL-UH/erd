 thanks buddy 




 I wouldn't do it. Evans could break out but he has nearly no value right now. You will never play him over your top 3 unless something big changes in TB, and you can probably waiver wire a similar guy pretty easily 




 see if he will bite on crabtree i guess, but I bet he's more likely to take a rb. I'd try pierce while you still can 




 yes, huge deal for you. 




 I would definitely do it straight, but maybe make it a 2 for 2 to start the bargaining, to milk more value and slightly upgrade another position if possible 




 definitely, paul will lose his job when reed comes back, and has his numbers inflated from easy matchups so far. kelvin is probably better than cobb anyways, and you get the best player at a position you are poor at.

 Save it for crafting legendaries 









 Hi Scott. First, thanks for writing. It sounds lame and cliched but reading Crapalachia this year was sort of life changing for me, it made me realize what was really important and what wasn't, so thanks. I've since picked up Collected Works, Hill William, and Stories V, all have been great. But enough gushing...

When are you looking to put out the Sarah Book (or whatever your next project may be)?

What have you read released in the past 10 years that really blew you away?

Any planned collaborations with Juliet? I enjoyed the three part piece on htmlgiant.

Thanks again 




 Same for net decking in any game 




 And so is saying that players who have reached legend are the best of the best. You and I both know there are many different systems that could be used to more accurately gauge player skill than this current system, but the reasons it's used are pretty obvious - it's much more friendly to bad players, and incentivizes playing as much as possible. 




 My objection is that the system punishes skilled players that don't want to play 200+ games every month. Time played is more of an obstacle to most players than being good enough. 




 But it works for 51% 




 And nothing is stopping anybody from getting to rank 5 in a week, then spending the rest of the month grinding it to become "a legend". Is that player skilled enough to deserve legendary rank? Probably not. 




 Why should time played be the primary metric to rate the skill/seriousness of players? 




 Sure, every multiplayer game is like this, but only because the devs prefer a model where to be the best at their game, you need to only play their game and nothing else.  To claim that legend rank equates to being "best of the best" is disingenuous. If Blizzard actually wanted a ranking system where the best players are at the top, they'd use some modification of ELO, not their current model, which boils down to being slightly better than a 50% win rate and playing a ton of games. 




 You won't get there without grinding tons of games either. 




 Legend rank doesn't really have a lot to do with skill - You need a little bit, but mainly you just need to devote a lot of time to grinding matches. 




 I am 100% free to play, it's definitely possible to spend no money. Learning how to draft is probably the most important thing in building a collection and staying F2P, and that just comes with practice and time.

Otherwise, just make sure you get all your daily rewards 




 ugh 




 runegrove guardian to force uterra, hope you get a few seals of deepwood 




 Thanks for the reply, enjoyed the first book a lot and looking forward to picking up the rest! 




 NO 




 I'm about 95% through Promise of Blood, can I go right into the Crimson Campaign, or should I read the 4-5 novellas? Would I miss a lot if I skipped them? 




 I think Sam Pink is great. His books are funny while being depressing, thought provoking while being juvenile, kind of genius. Can definitely see some people hating it but I'd definitely give it a try - if you're already interested, chances are you'll really like it.

My favorite is Rontel but Person is great too. Cicero is on my big to-read list 




 It's no coincidence that the crafting restriction is going to be lifted right after a large tournament - Stoneblade wants to make money getting people to buy packs.

I don't even really mind that they do it - they are a business. Just please stop feeding us BS reasons about crafting, the only reason the restriction is there is so people buy more packs and legendary chests. 




 Not acceptable. Book stores aren't called libraries for a reason. 




 If you are drafting, multiple games don't really apply, and you just end up staring at the screen for 15 minutes.  




 my goodreads 5-stars for the year so far:

* *Factotum* by Charles Bukowski 
* *Person* by Sam Pink
* *High-Rise* by J.G. Ballard
* *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball
* *Knockemstiff* by Donald Ray Pollock

 Pretty irrelevant - people AFK when your win is already guaranteed, not beforehand 




 Notable American Women is awful. For such an interesting and weird premise, it is one of the driest and dullest books I have ever read. I'd recommend avoiding it... 




 or you could just play with your kids and play solforge when they go to sleep, rather than constantly inconveniencing everyone else? 




 Stoneblade is never going to do anything about it, and the people who live on this sub will mock you for complaining about a legitimate problem 




 You really gave it a chance, huh? 




 -- Lamar Miller owners, 2013 




 You don't need to read Bukowski in any order.  




 I would recommend trying something out of your comfort zone.

If not though, The Powder Mage Trilogy by Brian McClellan 




 *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball, beautiful book 




 *High-Rise* or *Crash* by J.G. Ballard

*Perfume* by Patrick Suskind

*Filth* by Irvine Welsh

 




 The fact that you're boycotting RPS rather than a myriad of other things that actually deserve your attention (don't lie, you clearly aren't) shows your intelligence 




 Geez you might inadvertently end up giving them 15 cents! 




 Try your library system, that's where I had to go to read it. Worth it though, great book great author. 




 I am married and have two kids, work a 40 hr a week job that I frequently stay late at, and regularly exercise. It's still very easy for me to read an hour or more a day. I will usually read for an hour in bed before falling asleep. Reading is only hard to find time for if you don't want to do it. 




 For those that have drafted and noticed, is the Yahoo H2H schedule accurate pre-draft, if draft spots haven't yet been assigned? Or does it change once draft spots are assigned? 




 BTA is insane, Super House and Volgarr are both very good games 




 Apologies if this has been asked before.

When I go to join a new draft, I click join and I get the usual window where you select your payment method, but it is blank besides two lines. I need to exit the game to leave this window. I am playing on Android.

I figure it's something that will get fixed soon, but would be interested to hear if anyone worked around it. 




 Here's a newsflash, every software company does this 




 The way to "exploit" them is to not draft anyone from that team. I'm in a couple of leagues with near 100% patriots fans and have never had a patriot on my team 




 Everything That Rises Must Converge or A Good Man is Hard to Find by Flannery O'Connor 




 You didn't miss anything. Lots of rambling pseudo intellectual masturbation with some ephebophilia mixed in there.

BUT IT'S A SATIRE MAN! fuck this book 




 yes

 congratulations 




 Richard Yates 




 You sound like an asshole 




 Hey dude, guess your Internet is working fine, thanks for timing me out for 15 minutes always appreciated 




 Same here, 1st round of a draft 




 It's super easy for SBE to check on a player that has been reported numerous times, look at a few game logs, and take action. If a player has five games reported where he is inactive from 15:00 to 2:00 and then pops up to take a turn, I think it's fairly obvious what's going on. And if your phone sucks badly enough where you're taking 15 minute turns, buy a new phone. 




 If you continually time out and resume play in the last two minutes, you can pretty easily see that it's toxic behavior. 




 What do people think of having a "report player" button, similar to League of Legends? If people get enough warnings, investigate game logs/ban them?

The ones I run into are definitely repeat offenders - googling their name while I'm waiting, I'll run into threads where people mention them complaining about timing out. Won't shed a tear if they're gone for good. 




 A five minute turn timer is too much? Before I upgraded to an S5 I was playing on my iphone 4. Never got remotely close to taking 5 minutes for a turn. 




 I know this has been brought up time and time again, but it's still a big problem! I've had it happen to me twice today, (person stops playing around 16 min when it's clear they've lost, miraculously regain their connection with 1 minute left)  which equates to about 30 minutes of me blindly staring at my screen, doing nothing.

Luckily I'm at work with nothing better to do, but come on, is it so unreasonable to put in a five minute inactivity auto loss? If you're taking longer than five minutes to take a turn, it isn't due to you playing on mobile, it's due to you being a child and trying to scum wins.

It ruins things for people who actually have to walk away for a few minutes, but if you're constantly making your opponent wait 5+ minutes you're being incredibly rude anyways. 




 I'd go with spitemage, but haven't tried invoker.

Sorry you have to play tempys :( 




 Can't believe they still don't have this feature. Probably could get an intern to code this in a day. 




 I like specter in AN where I can metatransfer/technosmith him in addition to chumping scenarios. He's still not great but not the worst, I agree. 




 Kind of hard for me to say what is actually underrated, as draft is pretty weird and I'll still occasionally get 3rd pick matrix wardens or last pick corpulent shamblers. Cards i pretty frequently see going later than they should -

twinstrength, rotfiend, metamind overseer, metatransfer, phalanx squadron, field marshall 




 the transall saga

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121807.The_Transall_Saga 




 more referring to IJ, gravity's rainbow, and especially finnegan's wake  




 Feels like I'm responding to a joke, but giving high school kids brainmelters probably isn't going to instill a love of reading 




 :\ 




 I'd let each teacher decide, giving suggestions of their own or from a large premade list, but taking a generous amount of input from the class as a whole. Maybe give the kids a list of 100-200 books at the start of the semester with a brief one liner description, have them pick five, and tally the votes?

"Read whatever you want to read" would be ideal, but you'd have the problem of lazy kids picking Hop on Pop for their assignments. 




 Not really concerned with the programming. If you play a consistent card in PL1, you are guaranteed to draw it in PL2? Does that mean if you play a level 1 consistent card in PL4 you're guaranteed to draw it in PL5? Does it still work if you metatransfer/synapsis oracle or do something similar to level it? Does the consistent do anything at lvl 3? etc 




 How exactly does this work? 




 you aren't alone 




 One of my favorite books. I'd say stick it out, everything meshes in the end.

It's The Devil All the Time, by the way ;)

 




 I will usually get most of my books from the library, so usually the only books I buy are the ones I have trouble finding for free. As such, my latest purchase is exclusively indie books my library system will never get their hands on that have been building up on my to-read list for a while.

 2013 




 Drink coffee, and don't read too late at night 




 First Law trilogy is definitely a lot more gritty than Half a King. I still like both quite a bit, but prefer First Law. 




 None of these have absolutely floored me, but I have really enjoyed:

* *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer
* *Half a King* by Joe Abercrombie
* *Bird Box* by Josh Malerman 




 In PL1 I hardly ever want to play 6+ power guys, minus a few exceptions like swampmoss lurker, nexus pilot, glutton, etc. I love drafting cards like the Uterra 7/8, but I only play it in PL1 if I'm forced to, even without a WWP in my deck.

Factor in that you're probably playing with things that leave small bodies around (especially in U/N, arguably the best draft archetype) and WWP is just consistently an all star. Still not better than strategist/battletech, but probably third best heroic. 




 WWP on 2.1 or 3.1 is practically a free win. Its strength isn't in being a good underdrop. 




 I always take the legendary if I don't have a set.

From there, the obvious answers - battletech, strategist, patriarch, nightgaunt, matrix warden...

Your question depends a lot on the legendary too. I'm not taking much over zimus, but I'll take almost anything over binben/nuada/arboris 




 *Crapalachia* by Scott McClanahan. Incredible storyteller. If you don't like it you are probably heartless. 




 cute card that will see play in tier 2 decks 




 No. I do plan on reading everything that my children read in parallel with them, however, to discuss any potential issues they have with the subject matter. 




 I agree with what you said, but losing individual games to luck via level screw still certainly exists, and is frustrating. 




 I see you're playing N/A, but in U/N Pact, I've been playing Pact as just an underdrop. It's bad phase 1 as it will usually just pop out a 5/2 zimus. It's nice on a bad draw in phase 2/3, but as such it's hard to actually level the card. 




 I've been trying tarsus/pact variations, and haven't been that impressed. Not sure if it's the pilot or the decklist, but pact is so often just a whiff, especially since I try to aggressively level zimus. Certainly agree that it's very swingy, although I'm running two echowisp due to only having one lotus. 




 What do you think the tier 1 decks are in the current meta? Which decks do you think currently underperform, and which are the real deal? Will any new cards have an impact once the 7/15 crafting embargo is lifted? 




 those are some precise statistics 




 fleshfiend is the best by a lot 




 You are right, the two-ofs are not crucial at all, and are the replaceable cards. 

Reveler is basically "hope i draw it in a favorable 1.4 situation". Will win some games outright now and then but I definitely wouldn't fault anyone for cutting them for a 3rd phoenix.

Phoenix is a great card, but I feel like it doesnt synergize very well with the deck. I like to drop him if I don't know what I'm playing in phase 1, good underdrop, sometimes 2.4 pays off if your opp is still alive, but overall not crucial to the deck

uranti bolt I don't think I really ever cast it, could easily be cut, but gives you various removal options i guess

I just don't think there are many better cards. I would rather play all of these over firefist uranti, warbringer uranti, etc.

 




 * 3 thundersaur
* 3 weirwood patriarch
* 2 uranti bolt
* 3 uranti warlord
* 3 ferocious roar
* 3 uranti icemage
* 3 glacial crush
* 2 solstice reveler
* 3 wallbreaker yeti
* 3 rageborn hellion
* 2 everflame phoenix

I think it's inevitable that you get beat by zombies, but it seems like everything else is favorable 




 Rewards are very different from planned features. Kibler made it more clear below - it certainly wasn't before.  




 Source? It's a nice thought that playdek will provide tournaments, campaigns, etc, but that's nothing more than speculation. 




 100 bucks for a lifetime subscription to get the roughly 3 dollar expansions playdek releases twice a year? Sounds like a great deal, who'd be unhappy with that? 




 The playdek app already exists. The promised new version would provide tournaments, campaign mode, and was generally made out to be a more robust version of the existing client, with possible future developments like creating a custom ascension cube.

What exactly do backers get out of this now? The same iphone client most of them likely already have? Promo cards they've already bought?

It's great to see Playdek continuing development as IOS ascension is great, but as a backer, where did the money you pledged actually go? Certainly not to where you thought it was going, but hey, you still get your backer reward t-shirt. 




 Why would they be happy? They just got scammed. 




 Thanks, Ascension online backers, for funding Solforge development 




 It can pretty easily wipe out a level 1 for free and then still manage to trade with a level 2 




 If you're halfway through, you have around 100 pages left. Seriously, you need to create a post about whether or not to finish 100 pages? Sack up and do it 




 Didn't really like The Grand, but Incident at Loch Ness is quite enjoyable 




 The Pearl by Steinbeck (3.33). Probably due to the "forced to read it" aspect, but I find it hard to see how anyone could really dislike it 




 And besides, what else are you going to do with a kid under six months? Reading to them is fun and a good bedtime habit to get into. Start training early to read Hop on Pop 500-1000 times... 




 calling out your opponent is pretty rude 




 Best movie ever made 




 *nuncle 




 Thoughts on Stronghold Crusader HD for those new to the series? Is it a good starting point? 




 Strategist  WWP  GGP  bulk 




 oh fuck off 




 Laird Barron, ramsey campbell, thomas ligotti, andersen prunty, robert aickman 




 People are downvoting this past most people's threshold just because they do not like the deal? Huh? Give me a break...

Even if the deal sucks, a lot of people come here to see what the deal is. 




 Annihilation was very good, I thought. I was a little underwhelmed with Authority - the pacing is pretty slow, and most of the first half of the book felt like it was just "remember all of the cool creepy stuff that happened in the first book?" Wasn't a huge fan of the convenient ending either, but the book had its moments, like [Spoiler](/s "the mural") which were really great.

Still very much looking forward to the last book. Vandermeer has other great books as well. Check out The Third Bear, it's an excellent collection of short stories and my personal favorite of his. 




 Let's be realistic here 




 When's the ETA for trading/auction house/dumping my extra legendaries? 














 Dune 




 Totally horrible, I guess they needed a card nekrium drafters could pick when their only other option is necrovive 




 I liked this book a lot, disappointing to see the other hasn't written anything else since 




 Running Man was really bad in my opinion, worst of the Bachman books. The campy movie is much more enjoyable 




 I've always thought the story takes place in an asylum, unreliable narrator and all.  




 Just pointing out the ways that it's worse than a mediocre card it's very similar to 




 Because in an aggro deck all your cards do generally the same thing, so getting 2 leper gnomes isn't all that different from playing arcane intellect and drawing wolfrider and a leper gnome from it. 




 because it would never be a dead draw in a deck with no minions... 




 It can be hit by flare, and it doesn't immediately give you the cards. arcane intellect is going to give you two comparable cards from your deck, so this card is only better if you run out of cards. The number of minions you can play is pretty irrelevant. 




 How is it any better than arcane intellect, in that case? It seems almost strictly worse. 




 Rather than saying "Wow, OP", why not try to add some actual discussion to the card? I do not think this card is very strong. It's a mediocre card. Visions of drawing 2 Antonidases, Rags, etc, are flowing through everyone's heads, And maybe if a control mage type deck becomes playable, this card could be a strong lategame piece.


For draft? It's pretty bad, worse than arcane intellect in my opinion. Every competent draft player plays around secrets already, so this card clashes hard with a lot of cards - hex, imp master, razorfen hunter, harvest golem token, silverhand recruit, violet teacher, etc. 


You will of course get some nice value some of the time, but most times, the card is going to be way harder to successfully pull off than you think, especially in draft.

 




 House of Leaves 




 yes, the solforge mechanics can be random and frustrating

no, the randomness is not the reason you are a sub 500 player
