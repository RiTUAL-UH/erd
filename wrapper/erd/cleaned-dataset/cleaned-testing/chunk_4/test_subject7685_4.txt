 Does it stack?

Example: If I use Aquaman's S1 to cause bleeding them immediately use it again do I get double bleeding damage or should I wait until the first bleed is finished before tridenting the enemy again? 














 I didn't get it as I found Ghosts to be boring, not bad, but boring.

 I put the work in to get into the top 4% and then like many others my time and effort was turned into a complete and utter waste of time literally overnight. I was down to some shitty bronze level. Did anyone get compensdated for the work they put in? Like at least be given the reward for the rank they were at before the game fucked them over? I think that would only be fair. Or if that's too much work for the guys who make the game how about a good faith prize of 100,000 credits or something? It would really suck if they fucked us over and offered nothing to make up for it. The risk of it happening again haunts me. 



















 I couldn't play saturday but have been sessioning the game for the last two days but I don't have time to get to the top 4%. It seems everyone is playing this season much more than the last couple.

 I was in the top 5%, then I checked again hours later (without playing) and I was in the top 3%. I look this morning and just assume a new season had started. Nope. There's 15 or so hours left and I'm bronze because of the battle points issue. I'm not playing today, what's the point in giving us an extra 24 hours? WTF can we achieve in that time? Silver? I wish they'd just accepted this season as a complete fail and moved onto a season with a decent reward instead of trying to resurrect this season's corpse for 24 hours. Now I have no reason to play the game for the next 15 hours. 















































































 It seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he says something you'd expect to hear from someone living in the 1700's. 





























 Why do they allow us to pay for promotion on most cards, but then there's some that can only be promoted if you're lucky enough to get that card again from a certain pack (looking at you killer frost) while others can only be promoted through online challenges? It's infuriating! I have GF Supes, Ares, and KJJ on a team. I have a promotion waiting for Supes as I completed the single player challenge twice. I have to wait for Ares to show up in the MP season again to get a promotion for him so who knows when that'll happen, and KJJ won't be promoted until I manage to get another 60 alliance credits together.

On another team I have Raven, Aquaman, and Killer Frost regime. Raven and Aquaman can be promoted at any time with credits, I like this. But Killer Frost can only be promoted by being lucky enough to find her again in a challenge booster pack, which I have no intention of doing because there's too many cards in there that I don't want to warrant trying to get one specific card from it. This seems like lunacy to me. Does anyone know why they've made it so infuriating to keep teammates promoting in sync? 












































 Who are they and do you rotate characters from team to team?

I've always teamed 3 characters together and stuck with that. I only ever mess up the teams when doing challenges that require certain characters.

I currently have 7 teams in my rotation, they are:

Bronze Team:

Nightwing E7 Lv 47
Green Lantern E7 Lv 47
The Flash E7 Lv 47

Silver Team:

Deathstroke E7 Lv 50
Regime Doomsday E7 Lv 50
Wonder Woman E7 Lv 50

The following teams are all gold:

Regime Superman E1 Lv 50
Batman E1 Lv 49
Regime Wonder Woman E1 Lv 50

Man of Steel General Zod Lv 50
Lobo Lv 50
Red Son Green Lantern Lv 50

Raven Lv 38
Aquaman Lv 38
Killer Frost Lv 38

Blackest Night Batman Lv 32
Luchador Bane Lv 31
Regime Raven Lv 31

Godfall Superman Lv 24
Ares Lv 24
Killing Joke The Joker Lv 24

I don't buy power credits that's why I have so few promoted gold cards.

My next team will be Cassandra Cain Batgirl, who I've already got, and I'm going to team her up with Animated Batman Beyond and MKX Scorpion when they turn up. 














 Hey guys. I just tried to buy 600,000 power credits using some itunes credit I have lying around but it seems to have not spent the credit. I can live with this, but the game crapped out on me after it said "purchase complete". I reloaded the game to find I have 1,200,000 power credits. I only wanted one money pack but I seem to have been given two. I did not intend on buying two packs. I want to see if I've been shafted and charged for an extra pack I didn't want. These things are 35 a piece! Is there any way I can see my purchase history? This is an issue. 











































































































































































































































































































 Pretty sure I'm asking for trouble here. Let's see if we can engage in civil discourse. 














 I use Chrome but sometimes at work I use IE and it doesn't seem any slower than Chrome, or appear to be inferior in any meaningful way. So why the hate?
