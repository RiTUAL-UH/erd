 The "social scene". "Hanging out" without an explicit purpose is pointless and over rated. 




 Surfing the internet, watching TV, smoking cigarettes, and drinking beer. 




 Had a job that pays over $10/hr. 




 Really, the only way to get the corrupt people out is with general unrest, so the corrupt individuals fear enough for their lives that they either flee the country, or just walk off the post.  I think causing general unrest would lead to a reformation.  

But the bad part about revolutions is; it is impossible to predict what new government would form.  It could turn into a Porfirio Diaz dictatorship again, or be like Somalia on our border. 




 Correct, it's nice dreams. :)  That movie rocks! :) 




 No, at the choke points, we would arrest entrants into the country, and deport them 2000 miles into mexico.  They just get shipped back, but not blown halfway to hell.    I don't think the CIA backed coup would do much good, in addition to the corrupt federal government, you also have the leaders of the federal police, the state and local governments, and the Mexican military.  

That whole country is corrupt, and I think we should drop Mexico from NAFTA, and impose heavy trade tariffs of 50% or greater for any goods imported from Mexico.  Do a war of economic attrition.  Also, don't export anything to Mexico.  Of course, this didn't exactly work with Cuba, so Mexico may be a lost cause. 




 VW Beetles are the best car, because if you drive in the water accidently, it'll float for hours before it sinks, and you can use it like a boat since the engine is at the rear. 




 The Day After (1983) 




 Epicenter of a thermonuclear detonation, riding the bomb like Dr. Strangelove. 




 Go without showering, since I showered the night before.  Wash face, shave, put on clothes, out the door I go. 




 Because they're a manual laborer, and don't want to get their house dirty from the day's work.  That's why I do. 




 Blumpkin Inspector. 




 No, that was the immigration law at the time in the 1800's.  If they were a criminal back home, (literally, wanted for committing a crime), they were denied entry into the USA.  I'm not calling people who jump the border criminals.  It's at most a civil infraction, much like speeding.  

Also, the Indians were too busy fighting each other, and they really had no concept of land ownership.  They had hunting grounds, and areas they lived in during different times of the year, but no borders. 




 Yes, 1 lid ~ 1 oz.  Most people didn't have scales in the 70's.

Before pot was legal here, it went dime bag, 20 sack, 8th, QO, HO, OZ.  I've never ordered more than that.  Fortunately now, if I want pot, I just go to the store and buy it. :) 














 The fall of the inner-german border. Bet on it November 7 of 89. I would be a billionaire. 




 Drink beer and watch TV. 




 Get drunk. 




 Marijuana. 




 Mutual fellatio. 




 When my ancestors came here, there was no border control beyond Ellis Island, and the only thing they looked for then was lack of "consumption", not be chinese, not be a criminal, and pay $0.50.  The 1800's basically HAD no immigration laws.  You can't illegally immigrate to a place with no border controls. 




 "HEY! Somebody ripped off the thing I ripped off!" 




 Cheech and Chong. 




 Only because of the 1878 PCA.  It could be repealed by congress with a simple majority vote.  It is not constitutionally prohibited, nor does the PCA prohibit the national guard from operating as a police force when called into action by the governor of the state. 









 We should do that! :)

 My VCR doesn't even have a clock on it.  It has an internal clock for setting tape times, but not a front display clock. 




 Well, no, I don't want to blow the illegal immigrants half way to hell and back, just the cartels.  Yes, it would be unrealistic to do this, (as it would be very expensive), but we could let a few choke points open, so they have to go through that area if they don't want to get blown up.  I highly doubt the Mexican people are going to stage a revolution against the drug cartels, and corrupt government that can be bought with money.  

From what I read, the Mexican people aren't even allowed to have any semi-automatic weapons, and have to use lever action rifles, or single shots, (and only then, if they aren't a military caliber).  There is no "bringing Mexico up" to our economic level.  With the government in power there, and the cartels, there is no chance in hell of helping that country at all.  I think we fucked up by signing the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  We could have had that entire country as the USA.  

Except then, we would have to deal with Guatemala.  That border, we could seal.  What I think is sad, is Guatemala is so damned poor, Mexico has an illegal immigration problem from there. 




 That too.  Don't forget about boss cars, fast boats, strip clubs, fine cigars, excellent wine, and vacations so expensive it would make Obama blush. 




 Actually, that's not too far off.  In Peru, a kilo of cocaine costs about [$800](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/peruvian-cocaine-best-value-for-traffickers-bolivia-police).  Once it gets here to the USA, that same kilo in the USA costs around [$27,000](https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/mexicos-cartels-and-economics-cocaine). Those are wholesale prices.  Then it gets down to the street level, where an 8 ball costs around $350, (the last I checked).  So, that's 3.5g for $350. That's $100,000 of money to buy a kilo of cocaine in the USA off of the street.

Yes, the low-level street dealers, (that often work for below minimum wage), their suppliers, the distributors all get the cut, as do the mules, but most of that money is funneled right back into the Cartel hands. 




 Yes, obviously.  But if they fucked up by backing over a fence post?  They're the ones that damaged property, so they get to fix it.  (I had to do this several times). 




 How?  Yeah, the prison industrial complex would likely dry up, (that's good), ER's wouldn't be so busy with gang shootings and overdoses, the rehab industry wouldn't be so busy.  But all of these are good things. 




 That's why we put up an internal fence to keep them out of the DMZ, and [this sign](http://i.imgur.com/zkRY88P.jpg) pretty much gets the point across of DO NOT CROSS. 




 Not the unarmed ones.  In that case, just call INS/USBP.  But if they start shooting?  Shoot back.  Actually, this is already legal.  The only thing that would change is we would be arming them with military weapons, instead of letting them arm themselves with semi-automatic look-alikes.  I think a few cartel groups getting mowed down with M240 SAWs would send a message.  And if they come with vehicles?  A BGM-71 takes care of that.  

Set up antipersonnel and anti-vehicle mines along the border, and set up hedgehogs lined with concentra wire, and caltrops.  Put in anti-tank ditches too. 




 I dropped out after 1 semester in 2001. I've worked menial jobs all of my life, and I don't expect it to ever change. I'll never be rich, or even middle class. I'm unemployed now, and I'll do anything for work. In my mind, "career" does not exist, it's just some jobs last longer than others. 




 I said only on our side of the border. If they're on your side of the line, they're your problem. You deal with it. But the instant that they cross into US territory, we blast the hell out of them. 




 I think I got my sleep schedule back on track. 




 I have no "passion".  I just exist.  I'll do anything legal to pay the bills.  I don't really care what I do for a living. 




 Anything promoted on MTV or any other reality show. 




 Double dildos. 




 Didn't the USSR have borders that long?  They were pretty successful at keeping people in. (even from other Warsaw Pact countries) 




 [All dressed up, nowhere to go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhAOlAq_9ME) 




 I thought they were collaborating with the Mexican military, and had their protection? 




 Or anybody else on US territory.  (except for each other, they can kill of each other all they like).  Hell, we should arm the civilians down there with military weapons (light arms, and crew served weapons), and give them immunity for shooting back. 




 No, I thought they were wishing for the modern world back, but TIL. 




 I do, but if I'm watching TV, then I don't need to look at my wrist. 




 Only if fired upon. 




 Not from what I gather from the lyrics.  Why else would you trade hot ashes for trees? 




     Got in a little hometown jam. 
    So they put a rifle in my hand. 
    Sent me off to a foreign land. 
    To go and kill the yellow man

 (nuclear war) [Wish You Were Here  
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic)

    So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
    Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
    A smile from a veil?
    Do you think you can tell?

    Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
    Hot ashes for trees?
    Hot air for a cool breeze?
    Cold comfort for change?
    Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

    How I wish, how I wish you were here.
    We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
    Running over the same old ground.
    What have we found?

    The same old fears.
    Wish you were here.

(about a wasted life) [Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL3AgkwbYgo)

    Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
    Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
    Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
    Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

    Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
    And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
    And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
    No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

    And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
    Racing around to come up behind you again
    The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
    Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

    Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
    Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
    Hanging on quiet desperation is the English way
    The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

    Home, home again
    I like to be here when I can
    And when I come home cold and tired
    It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
    Far away across the field
    The tolling of the iron bell
    Calls the faithful to their knees
    To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

 We deploy M1A1 tanks, HMMWV, and apache helicopters, (fully armed).  As soon as fired upon, we blow the intruders off of the face of the earth with Hellfire missiles, 88mm mortars, 120mm shells, and 50 caliber fire.  We will no longer tolerate them in our country, and will use all force necessary to repel them.  However, we do not cross the international border into Mexico. 




 Being eligible to be drafted, (OK, only up until 25).  Voting. 




 Taking on the USSR, and fighting a two-front war.  They should have stomped the UK first. 




 I already have. 




 When I was 17, I wanted to be a locksmith owning my own businuss in Las Vegas, earning around $75000 a year in 1999 dollars, living a couple miles outside of town on a 2 acre property that I owned, with a triple wide mobile home bought on a 15 year mortgage, driving a 2 or 3 year old paid off truck.  If it had gone to plan, I would have about 3 years left on my mortgage, and I would be financially secure with zero debt besides my home.

I'm 32 years old, and still living in the same county that I was born.  I moved 16 miles to town off of the family ranch, and I drive a 18 year old truck, and I live in a rental property.  I'm now unemployed, and the highest wage I've ever earned was $10/hr back in 2008.  So no, my dream did not come true.

I have given up on dreams.  They are futile, and the realm of children.  They serve no purpose in the adult world, and I only exist to survive now.  I see no point in dreaming or fantasizing about that which I will never realistically have, or be able to obtain.  It is a waste of time to dream.  

 




 No.  Every socio-economic stratification has assholes, and generous people, and greedy people, and entitled people. 




 Whatever happened to just having an [analog clock](http://i.imgur.com/bPPD722.jpg) above the TV? 




 What ever happened to having an analog clock above the TV?  I've always had it set up like that.  Or here's a thought; Look at your watch.

 No.  Not to an unknown person who's intentions I don't know.  No way in hell. 







































 With my TV, (well, my downstairs TV), I just plugged it in, did a channel scan, and away I go.  Since my TV upstairs is an old CRT TV, I need a QAM box to get the Clear QAM channels, but it works perfectly fine.

Yet, on the TWC website, they say that "I need a box" to be able to receive anything, when I clearly do not.  Are they just gambling on the fact that most consumers will take their word at it, and not try it themselves, (so they don't have to pay the box rental fees)?

 I saw that on the cable bill, if I rented a DTA, it would be $2.95/mo.  What exactly does that box do, that my 3500STBII will not?  I have analog and QAM service still in this city.

 I'm making the walls vibrate now.  They kept me up all last night, so I'm keeping them up all day.  Turnabout if fair play.  I hope they REALLY like 70's rock and 90's rap.  Fucking 20 year olds keep me up?  I crank my amp.  They're not going to sleep today. :D  I have mu subs right against the wall, and I'm vibrating the house like a cat purrs.  Fuck them.  NEXT UP TUPAC!

 Turn about is fair play.  Don't do it to others if you don't want it done to you. 









 I've been watching I was banned from seeing as a kid, and they're either incredibly sad, very depressing, or very gory.  I don't even like watching them as an adult, 20 years later.

 I tried asking on ELI5, but it's broke and not working.  I can give you the log if you want to see it. 



























































 MSTK, Windows Loader, some clever reg hacks, TimeclockReset, and before that, just sharing CD keys.  Oh, don't forget about BIOS hacking, and writing your own SLP table.  Pirates have always found a way to get shit for free, and always likely will.  So why are they claiming that they won't?  This seems like a very familiar claim to Windows XP. 












































 The other day I noticed several rabbits running next to my window.  1, "hey, that's pretty."  2, "Hmm, must be mating season" 5, "Umm?"  10, "what the fuck?  where all all these rabbits coming from?"  20, "OK, time for mister air gun."

I went outside and was starting to set up because it's obvious that I now have a rabbit infestation, I don't want to kill them all, just a few because I don't want my lawn ruined, and they seem to be already wearing a path through my front lawn.

Before I even got set up, I had my pistol just sitting in plain sight, and some dude happens to walk buy and ask "Hey, what type of gun is that?"  I tell him that it's a BB gun, and I seem to have a rabbit infestation, as I just saw 20 run by, so I'm going to reduce the population a bit.  He chuckled, and said softly "fucking rabbits" then in a normal voice, "Well, good luck with that, let me know how it turns out", then just kept on walking.

I got 3 of those fuckers btw, and they're now in my freezer.  I still have to flesh them, but they're gutted.  Yes, I'm going to eat them.   But since people seem to be so alert to even a "huuuu Im hunting wabbits" mission, I don't think a public shooting thing could or would happen here.  :) 












































 I was coming back from Moscow ID buying cigarettes, and this dude pulls up next to me on the last stop light out of town and revs his engine.  I first acted like I didn't hear it, and just kept looking forward.  He revs again, so I rev back, and did a stand on my brakes, and revved up to 3000 RPM.  Light turns green, so I let off of my brakes, and smoke his ass all the way to all of 60.  He keeps on going, and makes it to Pullman sooner than I do by 2 min.  But he's stuck at a stoplight that I just rolled up to, (and I didn't have to stop because I timed it right), so I passed him at 35 MPH.  

He gets on his gas again, and floors it.  He swerves off to a side road, and I just think he's a moron for wanting to race under the conditions.  I wasn't even trying to race the prick, but it seems he thought that I wanted to because I did race him to 60, (the legal speed limit), before backing off.  Stupid idiot didn't clue it I stopped when I reached 60, and kept on trying to race me.

Why are people so damned stupid when it's obviously  no condition to be doing a street race?  Racing is dangerous enough, so what compels them to do it in excessively dangerous situations?  That guy in the white blazer is a damned idiot. 



















 They start broadcasting "THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  THIS IS AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.  IF YOU ARE NOT IN SHELTER SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY!  THE USSR HAS LAU..." and then the lights go out, and there is no more broadcast.

What is your action plan? 






















































 What if we leveled Afghanistan, and turned it into a field of radioactive rubble?  The full force of the US military is now on your ass, nukes included.  Nothing will be left standing. 







































 I am introverted by nature, but the (thankfully few), times where I've had to respond to a legit emergency, I seemed to take charge of the situation and even go to the extent of directing traffic until EMS arrived, The other time, I saw a guy hit a deer and almost total his rig.  I kept on going for a little bit, but then decided "I should chek if that guy's even alive, and went 90 back to the schene of the accident.  I pulled up on people crying, and so I took charge and ended up having to shoot a deer with my handgun.  There's no way in hell that I would do this in normal circumstancces.

(I flipped off a bird when i it it , (going too fastt, and the collision made me spill my coffee on my nuts)  I just kept on going.  But in an emergent situation, I seem to stop, and take power within the fullest of my ability.  Why? 




 Just got done watching "Cold War" by Dr Who, and when that alien was about ready to launch, I started trembling in my boots like it was really going to happen  Yes, I lived through the 80's or else I wouldn't be posting this, and reddit, (nor modern tech, nor humans), would exist.

But why did it give me the physical chills and make goosebumps rised, and short of shooting my entire family and myself, I reacted the same as if the EBS system started going off right now. 









 You're hired.
