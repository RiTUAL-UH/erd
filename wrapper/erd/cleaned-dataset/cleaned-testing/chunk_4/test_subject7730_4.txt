 I'm looking for quality FREE Vst's. I make Hip-Hop music. Any VST/Filter/Compressor you feel a producer should have please leave in the comments below and a link to where we can get them would be great (not necessary)!

Edit: I use FL Studio.

Edit: Thank you to all who have posted! You guys help me find tons of new things to play with! Some more mastering tools would also be great, I forgot to mention that in the text   title when I wrote it! 




 Thank you BROOOO :) 




 Not very hard at all to get into it. Check out busyworksbeats on youtube for things you really need help on. I was in a similar position to you when I was 14 and I started making beats on FL with no knowledge of chords or scales. All I really suggest is buying proper studio monitors. For hiphop production THAT IS ALL THE HARDWARE YOU NEED. Get some good VST's and demos and your set. I've been making beats for about a year and a half and [these](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/my-chain/s-unAqy) are the types of things I'm doing now. 




 Suprised that no one has admitted being ugly...Prideful fucks. 




 Needing their mother to wipe their ass until they were 10 because no one potty-trained them. 




 I was playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, I got a nuke and the rest was history. 




 I'd love to see Azrael as a villian or should I say anti-hero 




 But super heat vision can't melt steel beams.  




 Imagine standing next to the railing when a huge wave hits and you almost falling over... 




 Because we do flips 'n shit 




 I love Murkah, but he's no Wings. Wouldn't you agree the show would be even better if it were Woody, Wings, Kyle, and Murkah. That's the All-Star lineup, doesn't get any better than that. 




 The podcast show and the Dubl D's podcast 




 Kyle his on to us! We must go back in time to eliminate his mother...Looking up past parental history...His mother...is...Sary Conor *GASP* 




 Wow I didn't know that it had already been a year. 




 What happened on the date of your flair 




 The hosts don't care about our input. Just keep watching old PKA's and...never forgive, never forget. 




 I don't know why it didn't link in the title. I pasted the link in the box. Link is now in the text above. 




 These are PKA stats, but I have sources that have confirmed 80% of PKA viewers fell victim to the ruse. 




 You have a good point 




 The Babadook 




 I hate games of thrones talk. I don't watch the show, but I thought you guys who do watch would enjoy this article I found. (I have nothing against the show, and I don't agree that it is a 'satanic' tv show)

LINK TO THE ARTICLE: [Here] (http://christnews.org/en/game-of-thrones-7-raisons-de-boycotter-cette-serie-aux-messages-satanistes/) 




 If it wasn't a Doctor Who mug would you have reacted the same way? He wan't flaunting it, he was just casually drinking whatever he was drinking. 




 What urks me the most though is that the hosts pretended to like him during the show for 50+ shows, but they talk badly about him now openly. Kind of makes me realize that I'm watching a SHOW and not a couple friends who are having interesting conversations. 




 Thanks for the parody of my post, but Lefty was god-awful and I was commenting my hate for him the second episode he was brought back as a permanent host. I mean did you listen to him and his fake laughs and the pseudo-intellectual rants he would get lost on. Huge blemish of the show. 




 oooooorrrr maybe he was just thirsty. 




 Chill man, I didn't click the link because I just watched a gif, no need to watch a video of the same thing. Could have just replied informing me that it was a Conan sketch without being rude.
 




 The Babadook, Sinister, Insidious 




 How do you accumulate comment karma? Kind of new to reddit. 




 *Kyle 




 Now, i've never been paintball-ing in my life, but one of the things I want to do before I die is play at one of these events and be on Kyle's team.  




 How did they get these shots of his home? Was he in on this? 




 It wasn't a good film. (I watched a bunch of reviews on youtube) 




 Are you an idiot? 




 I watched with both my parents and only because EVERY review I watched mislead me into thinking the movie was the best action movie of the decade. 




 I've never walked out of a movie, but I would have had I come to the movies alone. Come to find out the people I went with also wanted to leave during the movie. 




 A true cinematic turd that people mindlessly gawk over because they want to follow the crowd without thinking for themselves. People see the IMDB rating and automatically take the rating as fact. SMH
