 Not only does it set the time for a great album, I just listened to it and I have a final in 5 minutes, and I just realized how powerful of a song this is. That is all, I needed to share this. 




 Time 3:18-4:45, pretty much just sex on my ears, one day I'm gonna find a nice girl and impregnate her to this solo. 




 Right down the pisser! 




 So basically what I got out of this was that I'm going to become a Taylor Swift fan. Just kidding man, sweet pics of that airship and even sweeter beard brother. 




 Meh 




 I regret the fact that I have to say tDSotM is a perfect album, besides this one song I always skip :( 




 Upvote for O.A.R. I saw them a few years back in Hershey. Great live performers, the saxophonist is great. 




 Didn't see that one coming /s
 




 The Division Bell by Pink Floyd


Don't know how many times I've immersed myself in this album whilst studying. 




 Hmm that's still interesting. Thanks for the link, I do wish they would announce a number, seems weird that they didn't. 




 Halo 1 might be difficult to discern, but I was talking with my roommates today about what Halo had the most simultaneous players. The only thing I really found out was that Halo 3 had 1.1M players in the first 24 hours which is incredible. Can anyone point me in the right direction or know the totals for each? Thanks

 DISCLAIMER: The thoughts in this post are just my opinion and should be taken as such, so please just keep that in mind.


So I listened to The Final Cut then Amused To Death right after that, and it got me thinking. What if Waters came to the band with AtD instead of TFC? I personally really like most of TFC, but there are moments I don't care for. I also don't dislike it in the way some PF fans do. I also personally think AtD is Waters' best solo album and really enjoy it, however, I feel like it's missing a small PF feel to it. 


To many fans, I think, they'd consider DSotM through The Wall as the golden era of PF. Would AtD been a continuation of this era? Did Roger have such a chokehold on the band at this point that anything would've split them up? Would it be a great success and considered a classic? Would things have played out differently? 




 One of the better songs off TFC in my opinion. Especially, "SHOULD WE SHOOOOOOOOOOUT?! SHOULD WE SCREEEEEEEEAM?! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POST-WAR DREEEEEEEEAM?!" 




 Sam's Town is such a fucking great album 




 Dear McLordy, 4 incorrect uses of "they're" 




 Are there any sites that catalog pretty much every song by PF? Besides Wikipedia which I'm sure credits each song with the appropriate singer. I like this list you did, but obviously it's not the entire catalog as I find myself confused at times. 




 Dear lord, what a shame... I never heard of him, so excuse my academy ignorance, but it's a tragic time when any blue falls, 1st teamer, academy player, fan, or not. Rest easy bud. 




 As a student at WVU, this song is of great importance to me. To the place, I belooooooong, West Virginia  




 That's fair. I've been there.  




 "Gilmore".... cringing 




 I think out of all the carvings, this is the best one I've seen yet. Very well done. 




 More specifically: His favorite song by the band in general, and his favorite song to play on drums 




 As awful as the NCAA is, I hope they do the right thing and punish UNC accordingly. And this time when handing out punishments, make sure that they are punishing the correct people... not student athletes that weren't involved in the scandal. This is a total breakdown of the university at the highest level and it'll be hard for the NCAA to punish appropriately. But I have no fear that they will royally fuck it up. 




 I want some more of it. 




 Should have made Any Colour You Like longer and got rid of On The Run 




 This is my absolute favorite song to jam to in the car. Especially driving around town and having it blast for other people. I feel like I'm putting strangers in a great mood 




 Surprised no one said The Wall by Pink Floyd. Even came with a movie and it's super bad ass! 




 At the very end of the song is an amazing guitar solo, as we are all aware of. But I always wonder what could've been because as the song fades out, you can hear David Gilmour still just melting faces with that guitar. The solo is perfection, but damn do I always wish I could here more of that solo because by that point of the song I'm in such a trance-like state that I want more.  




 Twenty One Pilots and Pink Floyd. You can never have too much Pink Floyd though 




 Holy shit, you are awesome 




 Special shoutout to you too man. Hope to see you around here from time to time too. 




 I'm glad you've been given the reins. I don't post here much, but I check it daily and read your posts many times and it couldn't have been passed to a better dude. Anyways that being said. This song was kinda disappointing because Nobody Home to Comfortably Numb is my favorite part of the entire album. I actually find myself done listening to the album after Comfortably Numb, just because it gets a bit too abstract for me. That's all 




 Holy hell that was confusing haha, I'm not sure what I was voting for tbh 




 I thought Endless River wasn't going to include any new tracks? Just some archived material from back in the day. If so, there wouldn't be any new tricks unfortunately
 









 Thanks  man, glad you liked it. Yeah with those albums, only the most dedicated RHCP fans are listening  so that has an effect on it. I'm not sure what effect exactly ha 




 Thanks for the politeness man. I was a bit surprised about If you want me to stay, but Higher Ground seemed like the obvious favorite imo. 




 Hey all, I did a similar thing before with other bands where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays.  I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!

Format: **Album** song, plays

* **Red Hot Chili Peppers** True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, 275,575
* **Freaky Styley** If You Want Me To Stay, 190,731
* **The Uplift Mofo Party Plan** Behind The Sun, 522,631
* **Mother's Milk** Higher Ground, 11,757,320
* **Blood Sex Sugar Magik** Under the Bridge, 41,272,250
* **One Hot Minute** My Friends, 2,859,904
* **Californication** Californication, 38,054,331
* **By The Way** Can't Stop, 18,726,770
* **Stadium Arcadium** Snow [Hey Oh], 36,023,870
* **I'm With You** The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie, 6,746,450


Not that many surpises to be honest, but interesting nonetheless. 




 Is nobody gonna notice the shitty goalkeeping? 




 Hey all, I did a similar thing before where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays. I'm going to do this with RHCP since they have a large discography/fanbase. I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!

Format: **Album** song, plays

Not that many surpises to be honest, but interesting nonetheless. 




 about 60,000, which is less than 1% difference 




 There was actually like a 2 million play difference too, really surprised me. The closest was between like Comfortably Numb and Brick in the wall pt. 2 




 Drink some platinums and play this jam. 




 "I'll have what she's having" - Peter Griffin 




 I was just curious to see which Pink Floyd songs are the most listened to played by on Spotify. So I compiled this list real quick. I didn't include live versions or greatest hits albums.

* **The Piper At The Gates of Dawn** Astronomy Domine, 635,327 plays

* **A Saucerful of Secrets** Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, 423,609 plays

* **Ummagumma** Grantchester Meadows, 95,304 plays

* **Atom Heart Mother** Atom Heart Mother Suite, 356,850 plays

* **Meddle** Fearless, 723,573 plays

* **Obscured By Clouds** Obscured By Clouds, 232,580 plays

* **The Dark Side of the Moon**  Money, 6,621,602 plays

* **Wish You Were Here** Wish You Were Here, 15,706,636 plays

* **Animals** Dogs, 969,588 plays

* **The Wall** Another Brick in the Wall, Pt.2, 8,811,474 plays

* **The Final Cut** The Fletcher Memorial Home, 1,269,928 plays

* **A Momentary Lapse of Reason** Learning To Fly, 2,456,662 plays

* **The Division Bell** High Hopes, 888,566 plays

I would try to see if I could guess the most popular song off each album before I checked. Was surprised by a few, and others were sometimes obvious. Interesting stuff, hope you guys enjoy. 




 Well, I didn't intend on coming into r/pics to shit myself 




 Am I the only one when in the air, imagine that I'm looking at an ocean with the clouds being icebergs? Or nah? 




 I think the shoes are awesome and incredibly well done. I won't buy em because its just not my style of shoe. Thats not in any way an insult to you. Just not my thing. Only lower the price if the market demands for it to be lowered. 




 I didn't like Final Cut at first because I thought it was too polarizing. But the more I listen to it, the better it gets because I listen to it from Roger's point of view.

 Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers. This songs guitar solo was playing as I turned 21 and it's still my favorite shit ever 




 If he's fit, that's more than great. But with remy, my anxiety that has lingered for the past couple of years could be relieved. Not to hail remy too early before he's done anything. But there's no denying a complete mentality shift with regards to our strike force this season. They have awesome confidence that we've needed badly. 




 Big Brother is always watching 




 This was posted about a month or so ago and went straight to the top... I see you guy. 




 Rhymesayers 




 Badass intro I love it 




 Ahhh good suggestions. Too much hip-hop gets slept on in here. 




 So /u/LackOfForesight (gotta give him credit) did a thing where he asked /r/music for 52 albums to listen to over a year in an attempt to expand his musical palette. I suggested on his thread, that we listen to the albums as a community and discuss them on a weekly basis. It didn't get really popular but it seemed that there was still a contingent in the community that would like to do this.

* So I was wondering if that's something the community would actually be interested in doing. If this gains enough traction I will definitely be happy to facilitate the postings.

* There's a couple things that need to be cleared up first. Would you guys want use the list of 52 albums that he already compiled, or create a brand new list of "52 must listen to albums"

If you want to suggest a new album please put it in a format like this:

* Artist
* Album
* Genre

You can suggest as many as albums as you'd like, I'll keep track of it all, but keep it reasonable to albums that you think everyone should hear. This doesn't need to be an obscure list either. Suggesting famous albums is perfectly valid too.

I hope to get a decent enough response from you guys, Thanks!

EDIT: Good start, it looks like we'll be making a new list. So this needs to preferably hit the front of music's page to make sure we get enough suggestions. 




 I NEED THIS 




 Perfect, thanks man. 




 There has been a lot of variety and changes within the game since the start of the spring split. Champs have come and gone.I was wondering if there was any documentation of all the champs that have been used in this Summer split or Spring Split or both splits combined. And if that list was further broken down by region. It could be like an infographic that shows which region uses the most variety of champions. I'm sure this exists somewhere, so if someone wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. Thanks! 




 Let me guess, you read the thread title but not the thread? 




 Dude... We should just make this a community thing. Where everyone listens to the same album and discusses it. :) 




 It's because he's just matured so much since his past recordings, I think. He's an older more thoughtful dude, I expect this to be his new sound 




 Camera Thief is definitely my favorite song from this album, but this song is still pretty good 




 I think this is a phenomenal signing, hell I would've taken him as a number 1 striker if we didn't ever get Costa. 




 The perfect sunday morning tune 




 Wish you were here -- pink floyd 




 The music video for hero of war is so appropriately good
 




 I remember AIM ;) 




 This sub-reddit has a thing called their music hall of fame. It's not a list of the greatest bands ever. It focuses more on the bands that have the most links posted of their songs. So to reduce the amount of songs that get posted over and over by the popular bands, reddit made a hall of fame for these bands. Where, basically posting threads of their song links isn't allowed. All bands in the hall of fame have their own sub reddits. You can find this hall of fame on the front page of this sub reddit, on the right side. 




 I'm goin to see them Sept 6th in Pitt, I'm so excited 




 As a Chelsea fan, this parallel hurts my heart 




 Twenty One Pilots live at Newport Music Hall 




 You just can't post music links of RHCP songs as new threads, if that's what you're referring to 









 This Torres story better not end up in /r/yesyesyesno 




 Dear lord, this has become one of my favorite Sage Francis songs. So personal... So human 




 Hey everyone I appreciate the honest feedback! I will definitely be listening to the suggestions. Thanks again. 




 I've always been into rock from the 60's-80's era, even though I wasn't alive in those eras. But it wasn't until this past summer where I really started to listening to a bunch of Pink Floyd material and I have been bumping a few of their albums (Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall) a lot. I first listened to WYWH because I always loved the song even though I never heard the album. So I listened to the album and then from there on I kept listening to more and more. I have also listened to The Final Cut, Meddle, Division Bell, and Animals. I know thats not all of their material, but I was just curious as to what other bands have a similar sound or were heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. I think PF's sound is amazing, I love the amazing guitar-work, the lyricism, the ambiance about the tunes too. 

**TL;DR I recently have been listening to more and more Pink Floyd. Now I'm curious as to what other bands sound like them, or were heavily influenced by them. It can be from any era.**

Thanks! 




 The Q is backwards! Veigar doesn't play by the rules of mainstream alphabetical conventions. 




 I like the extended metaphor you used with comparing to reddit, interesting and valid observation. I'm more alarmed, not surprised, but definitely alarmed that the masses like this song by this artist that has 1 song on spotify. Not that spotify is the god of determining musical catalogues, but they usually have a great selection. So I'm just assuming that she is just a pretty face with a voice and will have Disney write her songs. 




 So yesterday was my 21st birthday, and 2 nights ago (night of Aug. 22 going into the 23rd) I was having a birthday party and had the gnarliest moment ever. I then thought it would be awesome at 11:55 to queue up Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers so at midnight as I turned 21, John Frusciante's guitar solo was absolutely kicking my ass and it was amazing. Beautiful, gnarly, awesome, it was just the way it had to be done.[Wet Sand, solo around 4:22ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWNDW5KtiKk)

Much love everyone, have a good day 




 O.A.R. -- Crazy Game Of Poker
 




 I've been thinking about the recent players who have left our club like Mata, de Bruyne, Lukaku and Luiz, etc. But one thing I've noticed, that when players leave the club, there doesn't seem to be any bitterness to the player from the fans. Hell, Juan was a club favorite and got pushed out by Mou, but he went to Man U of all clubs and Chelsea fans still love him (including me) and Luiz didn't really have a place in Mou's squad, but he was a fan favorite. I think there's a lot that can be said about Chelsea's fanbase as well as the quality of human beings that we bring in. Players with high character and commitment to the club. Arsenal burns players jerseys when they leave, which have been all their best ones, tbh.

**TL;DR Chelsea fans are great and don't hate players after they leave like Arsenal fans do** 




 RHCP babyyyyyyy 




 Shine on you crazy diamond by Pink Floyd 




 You sir, this what it's all about. This is the mission. Great Wallpapers, keep it up. 




 Fernando is that you?
