 There's a Breyer horse in it's box in there!  I see it!  I collect those man.  I wonder which one it is? 




 upvotes for forearm love! 




 I love draft mules!  How is Sunny to ride?  I've thought about getting a mule as a for fun/trail mount someday. 




 Me too!  I lust after him whenever I watch Party Down. 




 Ohhhhhhh my you are a lucky lady!  If you ever get tired of him, I call dibs!  :) 









 SO cute.  What a tolerant little guy!  My horse would give me a withering look to end all withering looks if I did that to him. 




 Oh he is lovely, and so talented.  I love that this picture is so high res that I can zoom in and examine his sexy stubble! 









 I think Mythbusters should try to reenact this one... 




 The gloves I have are amazing, and are currently on sale for $15!  They are engineered for people with arthritis (they support your joints and reduce hand fatigue), but myself and many of my friends use them because they really DO reduce hand fatigue while riding and they are an all around great glove.  Plus, they are machine washable!  Nice enough that I wear mine in the show ring.  http://www.bionicgloves.com/shop/?cat=31 id=43 




 Your taco is indeed beefy!  I approve.  Too bad it would be weird to share...or clone him.   




 Since it sounds like the saddle will be used on lots of different horses, you may want to wait on buying saddle and instead get some other accessories for her.  The first thing I got when I was a kid were a set of my own stirrups (so I didn't always have to adjust when I rode), and then when I got my first horse I got a saddle.  Boots, riding pants, a new helmet, a grooming kit, etc. may be better ideas for now. 




 Ohhhhh my.  To have the money to build something like that!  And those Friesians!   









 Your horse has such great ears!  Cute and tippy. 




 I wish I had seen this thread earlier!  Here are mine:

 Please don't shut this down!  I haven't even noticed the trolls you are talking about.  Let one of us (perhaps me) mod it.  Like Nymera says, there are trolls everywhere, and in every subreddit.   




 My trainer always likes to say that your toes should be behind the girth, no matter what gait you are performing, though the ear/hip/heel rule is a bit different for Saddleseat, since it is acceptable to have your lower leg farther forward.  This is especially true when riding a Saddlebred at the slowgait or rack, since it is often helpful to push your feet forward a bit (though it depends on the horse). 

Some of the best info I can give you are photos.  Here are pictures of this year's Senior Saddleseat Equitation World Champion.  The first picture is her "down" in her post, the rest are her "up" in her post.  Now, this is an equitation rider, so she is being judged solely on her position and control of the horse.  When I ride, my equitation isn't bad, but my legs aren't so far under me.  Sorry for the long urls.

Here is a picture of my "equitation" (these are old pictures from when I was a teenager).

Down in my post (my heels could be more down) http://i.imgur.com/P3nbi.jpg

Up in my post http://i.imgur.com/3p2Gu.jpg (again, more weight should be in my heels)

Hope this helps a bit!  Above all, don't ride like this!!!  http://www.uphaonline.com/images/2010%20awards/lamborghini-in-black.jpg (phenomenal horse, but terrible leg position!)
 




 I can't help you out with a date, but I would like to commend you for also using the word "pineapple" in your username! 




 I will always, ALWAYS upvote this, mostly because my boyfriend is a spitting image.  Grrrrowwwlllllllll. 




 Can you post a picture of his entire body so we can see his socks?  It would give him a better shot at being ID'd.  I have people I can send his photo and info to, but I know they'll want to see all his markings. 




 I haven't encountered another mix like this in person, but some people are beginning to intentionally breed them.  They call them "Spangold Retrievers" (which is an *incredibly* stupid name), but you can get one on the internet!  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/s/spangoldretriever.htm 




 Best ever!  Whenever I got to Europe, I stock up :) 




 I am by no means a "professional", but I have a nice camera, and have done things like equine photography and senior photos for people.  I think I could make it work. 




 Bart is darling!  And yes, where the heck to you ride?  Magical Acres???  It's beautiful!

Also, non-jumper person question: What exactly are the ear nets used for?  I see them on jumpers all the time, but we don't use them in my discipline.   




 oh yeah, rub that dirt right in to all the WHITE spots.  :) 




 Apollo is a Springer Spaniel/Golden Retriever cross.  We got him from the pound when he was a pup. 




 She is so cute!  I'm guessing she doesn't have the spaniel in her though, because her ears are way smaller and without curly hair.  I think black lab/golden is spot on.  Mutts are the best! 




 This is my dog!  He is from the pound also, and is a springer spaniel/golden retriever cross.  How big is your dog?  Apollo here is about 65 lbs. 














 Is this the one where we have to be from Canada?  I'll gladly participate, but I am in the U.S. 




 I don't know who this is, but I want one. 




 Wow, beautiful!  And I love your coat. :) 




 I came here because I KNEW he would be on the frontpage.  A ladyboner for sure! 




 This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  We love a good beard over there. 




 This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  Hellooooooooooooo OP. 




 This is a cute picture, but does not accurately convey his hotness.  Let's try this one!  http://28.media.tumblr.com/6imY2Ibivosygedu4nGXPYRxo1_500.jpg

Also this one is more recent: http://www.baltimoresun.com/media/photo/2011-01/58991602.jpg 









 Well whoever told you to post this here was correct!  Hot hotness!  And I concur with Januarys_Own -- may we see more? 




 He is super sexy, and when he rolls up his sleeves and kneads fondant...oooooooooo...

Have you seen the video of him playing guitar and singing?  Extra hot. 









 I just meant that I don't know who this is, or who the other out of focus people are.  I'm not a pop-culture queen, so this could totally be a famous person and I would have no idea.  Regardless, he's very easy on the eyes. :) 




 I don't really know what I'm looking at, but I like it! 




 Oh my. 




 ...wanna rip that moustache right off him.  Rawr. 




 Sweet jeebus, did you see this photo?  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SPKGl9Ae9N0/TkKkb3sZf6I/AAAAAAAAAxo/dbFhc8uBHxw/s1600/mateus+verdelho4.jpg 




 Thanks!  And yes, that is indeed me in the saddle.  :) 




 Oh my.  Yes! 




 This is a hunter pleasure class (the way Morgans do it).  This particular division was the Ladies Amateur Hunter Pleasure World Championship.  And yes, here are some pictures of him "au natural".  He loves to play in the snow. :)  1) http://i.imgur.com/bbXAq.jpg  2) http://i.imgur.com/zQ7nj.jpg  3) http://i.imgur.com/V5TBh.png

He goes home today and will begin the first day of his winter vacation tomorrow.  No shoes, no haircuts, and lots of time outside to run and play and roll in everything!  He loves to go to shows and loves to work, but I think he's ready for a break!!!   




 Muppet dog! 




 As the owner of a different dog named Apollo, I approve!  He looks snuggly! 




 Why does Iceland have to be so far away from where I live? 









 My GOD.  You are beautiful!  And wearing plaid!  And I'll be you have nice forearms too.  That's the test_subject773 trifecta right there.
