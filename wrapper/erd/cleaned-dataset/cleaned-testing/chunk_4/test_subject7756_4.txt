 oh the convos i've had on there.... lol 




 only the one contained in the article itself. there's video of them right after

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ-nBtPMV3Q 




 then fine, me and my partners will volunteer as tribute in the next paper they want to do about polyamory. there's nothing wrong with having multiple partners. 




 but they have everything in there, even a "think of the children" bit where it shows that there's no difference between children raised by polyamorous families.

essentially, the same arguments against polyamory kinda boil down to the same arguments against gay people.

 right, because everybody who enlists is deployed 




 We have lost too many, far too soon. If any of you are feeling down, please, please PLEASE know that no matter how far down that rabbit hole you go, no matter how hopeless it feels, PLEASE know that it will pass. so many of us have been exactly where Jess was, and we all somehow managed to come out on the other side. Please come talk to us, or with a friend, or call a hotline. 

 HUG 

rest in peace and power, jess. i'm sorry we didnt have more time together. 




 because being trans isnt a mental illness

duh 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 Congrats! welcome to planet girl! 




 jeez, how many trans people are there in singapore? i thought i knew of them all. 




 didnt see it, my bad! 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 ok, shot them a pm, i'll let you know as soon as they get back to me. if you dont hear from me, shoot me a PM and i'll folow up, k? 




 even tho i left singapore 20 years ago, i know 3 other trans people there, i can get the info of their docs if you'd like. and i think the age limit for T is 18, but i could be wrong. 




 i often wonder how my life would have turned out if i had come out at 18, would it have been easier or harder? i LOVE how attitudes towards trans people have changed so that it's more conducive for us to come out younger and younger. 

now as to what you can do.... any plans for college? trade school? student loans can be very helpful in getting your life started. (if you do it right)

any family member who's understanding enough that they'll give you a place to crash while you get yourself on your feet? or a friend's place? 




 that is the most amazing fucking story i've heard in a long time. congrats dude! your fam fam sounds friggin AWESOME 




 sad but true. 




 i dunno, maybe an ounce of human kindness.. 




 you're at the inbetweeny stage right now, and that's one of the worst parts of transitioning. EVERYTHING was hard for me and i found myself questioning my sanity on a daily basis. but even then, i knew there was no going back for me. i tried being the boy everybody told me i was. but deep down inside, i knew i was a girl. and deep down inside, i think you know it too, i think a LOT of us know that. hang on, this will pass.

and one thing i know is that you are NOT alone, we're all here for you. 




 Well, seeing a therapist is always a good first step, that's the one thing we always stress in all the trans subs. we tend to have a certain bias toward that kind of question, one that almost invariably leads to a positive answer. 

that being said, certain aspects of your story are extremely similar to mine. growing up, i always used to sneak into my sister's room and try on her clothes. they just felt soooooooo good to try on, and it made me very happy.

of course that led to a looooooooooooong period of buying and purging women's clothes. even in the army, i always had an  item or two stashed away.

it was always JUST enough, to wear the clothes whenever i got those "urges". but eventually, the need to be a girl became too great. i had to face the fact that i wasnt, in fact, a crossdresser, that i was, in fact, just a girl.

that was kind of a hard fact to reconcile with myself, especially with me being 42. but, as with all things in life, facts have a funny way of being true, regardless of how you, or anyone else, feels about them. 

and the fact of the matter, was that i AM a girl. Nothing on god's green earth can change that.

go see your therapist, if nothing else, telling someone else and sharing that secret you've had for so long is extremely liberating. you'll feel a weight lift off, sounds hokey, i know, but when i told my therapist, it was SUCH a feeling of relief. a secret like that weighs you down, and it just gets heavier and heavier, but it does so gradually, so you dont really notice til it's lifted. 

see your therapist, i hope you find your answer there. and please, always feel free to come here to share. you might also want to post in /r/asktransgender, or go read thru the posts there. you'll find lots of stories similar to yours. you're not alone, there are plenty of us who share the same stories.

 Have you accepted the Bright One as your Lord and Savior? 




 you should also sub to /r/genderqueer, plenty of people with creative gender presentations there. 




 ohhhhh, my bad 




 i didnt post it in awwducational 




 grooooooooooooooan 




 correct 




 the normies are a simple people, they actually think gender is binary and static. can you imagine such a thing? 




 SHAME 




 well, the first thing i'd say is for you to bring this up with a therapist. 

now that the disclaimer is out of the way...

that button test we all go on about, you know, the one where we press it and hey change-o presto, you get to wake up the next day and be a girl? guess what, you can press it at any time. just in your case, you wake up in a girl's body that's 6'3" and 273 pounds. and in so doing, you get to join the party of trans girls, and girls in general, bemoaning the fact that we dont look like supermodels. congratulations! here's a cookie.

look, it's not easy for us, but we transition because we're trans, and we're NOT the gender we were assigned at birth. we dont transition to fit into society's assumption of some arbitrary standard of what constitutes a female. 

that fear of what other people will think holds so many of us back, and that fear is often what drives so many of us to attempt suicide, some of us, multiple times.

go make an appointment with a gender therapist, it'll help more than you think. and dont forget, we'll always be here for you.

oh, and welcome to planet girl, buckle up, it's a hell of a ride 




 please be civil 




 please be civil

 I want to make a few things perfectly clear. Trans women are women. Period. End of story. Were not women who used to be men. Were not men who identify as women. Were not males who identify as women. Were not men who became women. WE ARE WOMEN. Stop putting qualifiers on our womanhood. Its offensive, hurtful and cruel to insinuate otherwise. Our past, present, and futures are ours to define and no one elses. Even if we didnt figure out that we were trans until well into our adult lives, it absolutely does not mean that we were ever boys or men. Many trans women feel that theyve always been girls, or at the very least, that theyve never been boys. You dont have any right to tell me, or any other trans person, that they were ever a particular gender, just as I have no right to tell you what gender you are. A trans woman who was obligated to present as male for most of her young life is was no more born a man than a lesbian who was obligated to date men for most of her young life used to be straight. 




 lololol 




 like i said, trans women are women. not a very hard concept to grasp.  




 send the message to the admins, and explain to them what happened. 




 it's ok to admit when you're wrong

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-if-sky-is-green-run-for-cover-tornado-is-coming/ 




 that's like saying you agree that the world is round, but you think it's ok that other people think it's flat. sure, they're entitled to their opinion, but they'd still be wrong. the FACT is that the world IS round. (well, roundish) and the FACT is that trans women are simply women.  




 i'm not the one arguing against gravity.

also, green sky http://kinooze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/green-sky-northen-lights.jpg

 




 it's not a very hard concept to grasp, so i'm sure you wont mind til i repeat it until everybody gets it. trans women are women, plain and simple. left handed women are women, right handed women are women, indian women are women, australian women are women, asian women are women, caucasian women are women.

now repeat after me.

trans women arent men, they're women.

thank you for your time. 




 sorry, nope again. trans women are women. 'nuff sed. 




 trans women are women, not men. 




 thank you, thank you, i'll be here all week

 yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! 




 yeah, they're looking at the market, they see the demographics that skew heavily male. it's news when there's a strong female character or plotline because of how rare it is. marvel is extremely risk adverse 




 and we find religious fanatics pushing back just as hard. and they use religion as the specific excuse why gay rights need to be opposed.

 you have to do it one step at a time, break up the journey into chunks. you're looking at the totality of it all and that's why it looks like a mountain. but if you aim for the tree just ahead, then the valley after that, then the group of rocks after that, it becomes manageable.  so you make the appointment with the therapist, or you plan to move out and get your own place, or you start saving up for laser or electro, or you start practicing your voice, or you ask for help.

even baby steps eventually get you there.

 nope, by all means, jump on in

 it's kinda interesting to me that only men make those kinda jokes 




 the polls show that a majority of the rank and file republicans are fine with same-sex marriage and lgbt culture in general. it's the leaders and the vocal minority of social conservatives that drive the narrative. that's why the talking heads can rant about it, but most serious politicians(i.e. the ones that want to win) wont touch it with a ten foot pole.

 and what side effects would those be? 




 When child abuse specialists, teachers, lawyers, and child care and school administrators convened at a symposium in 1995 to collectively decide what distinguishes developmentally expected sexual behaviors from those that suggest dysfunctional development and could be harmful, they decided that masturbation, inspecting the bodies of other children, and kissingthe three things Dunham writes about doingall belonged in the first category. 

As opposed to  the criminal-justice definition of sibling sexual abuse, which is forcible rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault with an object, and forcible fondling. which Josh Duggar clearly engaged in, according to his own admission.

 




 hell, i sometimes misgender myself.... 




 i mean, what the hell happened? i thought brownback was toxic? how in the hell did he manage to win re-election?? 




  I do not believe what she did was right

even tho that goes against the opinions of all the psychologists in that article that what she did WASNT abuse. so you're saying that your opinion trumps theirs? what are your qualifications that you can override them?  




 let's review, shall we?

child psychologists have deemed what josh duggar did WAS abuse.

child psychologists have deemed what lena dunham did was NOT abuse.

there's no liberal/conservative opinion talking points here. one was abuse, one was not. end of story. but please, dont let facts get in the way of your attempt to link the two. 




 true that 




 *sigh* that has GOT to suck 




 Urgh, sorry about that 




 "This is clearly not a case of abuse," developmental psychologist Ritch Savin-Williams, director of the Sex and Gender Lab at Cornell University, [told Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/04/lena_dunham_sibling_sexual_abuse_allegations_ridiculous_and_dangerous.html).

 there are no apologists, child psychologists have reviewed what Lena Dunham did and all of them have concluded that what she did was not abuse or molestation,  and appears innocent. 




 yeeeeeeeeeeup 




 i do know what you're talking about, i have a little transphobia myself, to the girls who i clock as "male." It's usually the girls (never the guys) who have just come out, the ones at the inbetweeny stage. it's something i am ashamed to admit. which is different again from the girls who have been transitioning for awhile who have so called "male" features that i find VERY attractive. it's kinda strange. 




 i know things can get heated in discussions, but please be civil and refrain from attacking the other person 




 i think Kansas trumps North Carolina in stupidity 




 Psychiatrist and WPATH Board Member, Dr. Dan Karasic, responded quickly to the WSJ, and his letter was one of a few selected for publication. We are including the full text of Dr. Karasics response below, though it is important to note that the WSJ editors chose to omit his clarification of Dr. Dhejnes research. WPATH members should be aware of the facts concerning these debates.

Dr. Paul McHugh ("Transgender surgery isnt the solution) writes about the study at Johns Hopkins in the 1970s showing poor outcomes from transgender surgeries, leading to McHugh shutting down Johns Hopkins transgender program in 1979, and the US Department of Health and Human Services declaring transgender surgery experimental, and therefore not covered. Two weeks ago, HHS reversed its 1981 decision, and removed transgender health exclusions from Medicare. McHugh seems unaware of the work in transgender health in these last 30 years that led to this reversal by HHS. 

McHugh does cite one study from 2011, by Cecilia Dhejne, MD and colleagues at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. However, he misunderstands Dr. Dhejnes work. In the paper, Dr. Dhejne states that the study was not designed to draw conclusions on the efficacy of transgender surgeries, yet McHugh does exactly that. A closer reading of the paper shows that the increased mortality is in those who had surgery before 1989, and that mortality in trans people after 1989 is not statistically different from the general population. A recently published paper by Dr. Dhejne and colleagues shows that the regret rate for those having surgery from 2001-2010 is only 0.3%. Dr. Dhejnes work shows that outcomes for transgender surgery have improved tremendously in the past 30 years, which supports the HHS decision to remove trans exclusions. 

McHugh also mischaracterizes the treatment of gender nonconforming children. As McHugh states, most gender nonconforming children do not identify as transgender in adulthood.  However, those who receive puberty blocking drugs do not do so until puberty, when trans identity is likely to persist. These drugs allow adolescents and their parents to work with doctors to achieve the best outcome. This approach was demonstrated to be successful in research in the Netherlands before being adopted widely in the U.S. 

The American Psychiatric Association and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health no longer view transgender identity as inherently pathological. Dr. McHughs views are stuck in the past.

 holy bejesus yes. girl orgasms  boy orgasms 




 no misgendering 




 lmao, love you too! 




 please dont use the "R" word 




 i know you're upset, but please keep it civil 




 dont misgender people 




 as another high femme, keep on keeping on. 




 i'm trans too, and i havent seen any difference in the way people talk to me when it comes to IT stuff..... prolly because i'm asian. lol, so many stereotypes. valets used to look at me funny when i had to park my car, now they just open the door automatically and park it for me. stereotypes abound. 




 o.O 




 not one of the authors, no. but i mod over at /r/asktransgender now, so i'm always on the hunt for trans related studies to add to the resources page.

and the Feds disagree with you too. 




 literal Jess is literal. it's in the title, silly 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeup 




  Because I'm not being transphobic. I'm considering everyone's comfort.. Not just the selfish transgender (wo)man i'm talking too

no, you're not, you're basically saying that YOU arent comfortable with trans people. that's it. you do not speak for anybody else. 

Simply put, I do not care one bit if you want to go so crazy as to slap on a pair of leggings, a tutu and a bright orange neon thong, prance around and sing I'm a barbie girl followed up with whatever the hell girls do.

and sexist too, nice.

 I however do not think you need to be in a restroom where many people expect a certain level of privacy from members of the opposite sex. You are not physically built like a woman. This can cause discomfort to people who are.

again, transphobic. even after i posted the study of all the schools, comprising 600k students where transgender polices are in effect showing that there have been ZERO incidents.

The best response you have to this is to keep saying it doesn't because "there are no recorded incidents" Is a totally dishonest way to debate seeing as there are pretty much no studies out there taking into consideration how the physically male and female students feel about it. At least none that are easily accessible. I can find a grand total of 3 quotes from students forced to share the restroom.

if there have been no reported incidents, then there is no reason to restrict access. like i sed, you have a solution in search of a problem.

I'm misgendering you because you're not even reading a damn word I say and overall being very disingenuous in how you are conducting this discussion... If you can call it that. I don't respect you enough to give a shit what you think you are at this point.

so basically you made up a reason for misgendering me. gotcha

like i said, there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege or transphobia. just like the fundies. 




 LET'S GET READY TO RUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMBLE 




 they got away with it for 7 years, that's a nice chunk of change 




 you cant see how transphobic you're being, which means you're as stubborn as the fundies, where you are right and every trans person is wrong. i've shown you again and again, thru studies, thru surveys , thru articles. the only thing you've done is consistently misgender me and say that trans people shouldnt use the bathrooms of their choice because you find it icky.  




 again, none so blind as those who cannot see. nice to find out that the fundies arent the only ones afflicted by it. 




 right, like i said, as long as we established that you were in fact transphobic. it's ok to admit that you're wrong, we all make mistakes. 

even tho there have been zero incidents at the school districts that have instituted a transgender policy where trans people can in fact have the use of the restroom of their gender. yet you insist on saying that it would make people uncomfortable. again, you advocate a solution where no problem exists. 

there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege, or their own bigotry. 

absent religion people, like you, will automatically default to the "ick" argument. EWWWW, that's grossssssss. i don wanna see it, make it go awaaaaaaaaaaaay. 

which, is a pretty juvenile argument, and i'm glad that i could point it out. it's not MY problem that you cant get over your own prejudice.
