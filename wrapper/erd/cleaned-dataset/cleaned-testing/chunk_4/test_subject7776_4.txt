 I'm not good with words, but if you need anything, I'm here. I can get you a card and stuff.

Live for your children. You wouldn't want their Christmas gift to be a permanent scar on their minds. Love works as a gift, kisses and hugs, homemade things.

I'm not an adult so I don't have adult ideas on what to do, but If you need money to get them something small I'm totally game for sharing some of my money.

I'm sorry this year wasn't the best for you. 




 Ah okay.

Drop the .jar in the mods folder
If you have a custom config put in config folder

Start server and type /veinminer mode sneak

Tadaa 




 We're good, I figured it out. But it was for my dedicated server.
Thanks though! 




 How would I add Veinminer to a server?
I've opened the FTP and put the .jar in the mods folder and the config in the config folder but it is not working. Any ideas? 




 Just, wow. Beautiful. I'm in absolute awe. 




 Not for awhile I think. It did just come out and it is an early access game. 









 I like more HP and everything, but that would just be a pain in the ass.

Still, looks very clean. 




 Hahahaha, and I hope man, I can't wait until 2015 so I can go to training and start fresh. 




 Marines, try and be a combat engineer. 




 Damn, I'm stupid haha, I read the first sentence wrong.
I know it's not all fun, there are long hours, bad pay, conditions can be shit. I understand its not all GUNS, 'MERICA, 'SPLOSIONS, or fun.
Drill instructors will yell/scream at you for every little thing you do wrong and how you talk.
Which I think is a good thing, I need a new experience, and learn how to get over things, or I'm never going to.
I just feel like it'd be nice to fight for the person next to you instead of yourself, for once.

Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, or what not, anyways, sorry if my post didn't make any sense last night. That is my bad! :P 




 I hope! And awesome, that's good to know just in case!
Thanks man! 




 Luckily you didn't get prescribed anything (I think), haha, but to me it shouldn't matter if I can take the meds after, cause one thing that makes me feel better is exercise and you have to stay fit to be a Marine so maybe I'll get a lot better if I get in.
Thanks man. 




 I don't know, ever since I was in elementary school I thought that being in the armed services was the coolest thing ever. And there are times where I try and pick a different career path, but I just go back to thinking about being a Marine.
I want to learn skills about how I should go about being a leader, and the bonds you make with the men next to you.
 




 Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year.
I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise.
I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can.
I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test)
Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday. 




 Thank you for serving.

I will look at the videos you have provided.
I have at least another year before they will take me, so maybe I'll think about it harder. People have told me to join as an officer and such.
 




 So, I learned today by a recruiter that any branch of the armed service will not take you if you're on depression medication, and will only take you if you've been off for a year with doctors consent.
So that put a little damper on my parade, I've wanted to join since I was little and I learn I cannot.
Sorry, I just wanted to express and inform people who might want to join some day.

Darn, I was excited too.. 




 Looks clean, nice fogged lights man! 




 I'd love a Metro key if you still have one, never played it but it looks really interesting.

Thanks man, your generosity amazes me. 




 Eh, personally don't like it. 




 Nothing. So I guess, calm. Then afterwards regret cause now I'm treated differently. 




 Couldn't see, not good at side angles. Haha, My apologies mate, thanks! 




 SVT Cobra, or Shelby? :o 




 I like the blackout. A lot. 




 I'm 17 and I want a Cobra.

Jesus, if this happened to me, I'd be so devastated. 




 Fuck. So I'm not alone.

Edit: Yeah I noticed I've gone down a bit and getting up isn't easy.. 




 Exactly. 




 Its actually lighter than 2014. And It does look like it should be on a Taurus. 




 Kinda sad about the style. It just blends in with Fusions and Taurus's IMHO. 




 I'm smiling. Wow. Thats just the cutest thing. :D 




 whoa. 




 Still in love with your car. 




 I'm on mood stabilizers, so there is that option. 




 I'm glad you're at least feeling something different. :) 




 you really had to look through all of his comments.. wow. 




 wat 




 Yeah I'm now just any RDM = 1 hr, come back and do it again 1 day, then after that its perma. I don't have time for 14 yr old kids trying to be Seananners. 




 I used to be relax but more and more I'm becoming stricter. It's becoming a real pain with the RDM. 




 I.. What? 




 Feelin' good with the bit coins I see. Hopefully he uses them :D 




 wat 




 Yeah, for real, thats a sick addition to the car. 




 Its something you wouldn't ever expect to see, at least for me it is. 




 The blue trimmed wheels look nice. 




 Ahhhh jealous. 




 Awesome!! 




 I was being completely serious, thanks for the help! 




 But the question is, do condoms fuck anything up. 




 Believe me, I'm looking for power but sleek and sexiness, I might as well go for the Cobra unless I can find a reasonable Mach 1 with some extra HP from stock. 




 I'm very, very jealous. I'm torn between wanting a race/performance/torch/whatever-you-want-to-call-it red Cobra or Mach 1.

Love how clean your car looks. How much did you get it for/do you have any numbers?

*edit: word 




 Mach 1, but either is actually good. 




 I cringed. 




 Ouch, our feelings... 




 I was open to close friends, and then got sent away 3 times and now people think I'm just acting like it but not really depressed. Oh well. 




 Adorable :p 




 No. 




 I'm alliance, but I would never disrespect the horde, especially one who died.  




 Is that a mustang model car I see....  




 Some people these days... Jeez, I'm sorry you have to deal with people like that. 




 Yes, simply put. 




 Oh thanks so much :D Sorry if it was a problem! 




 Oh my god, if you're still up for it can you do me? If not, that's completely cool!

 It was a sad day for us Huskies.. 









 why put a cobra anything on something thats not a cobra..? 




 Shhhh, don't comment if you didn't read the article. 




 I don't like the front end, but to each their own. 




 Huh, Maybe I'll chose to get a Term instead of a Mach then.. Thanks mate! 




 Nice, out of all of them which do you enjoy driving more? 




 I'm so jealous. I might hate you, but love you.
Sweet Mach and Term mate.
How much was all that? 




 I love it. 




 What Oni said. 




 Unless you hate the color, do it. 




 If you can, that'd be awesome. :) Thanks! 




 Oh dude/dudet, that's so awesome! Thank you very much :D 




 If its not too late, can you draw me :)?

 such a smooth gif... 




 I liked my IOP (was for teens), but I wasn't in there long, so I too would like to hear what people have to say and their experiences. 




 Its 7pm, why would we be sleeping. 




 No I got what you were saying. Sorry if it came off rude. 




 I could easily get 100 on BF3, no problems, I understand its the first day, but its so jumpy. 




 Anyone else getting low jumpy FPS?

My rig is:
i5 2500k @ 3.30 GHz
8GB Ram
GTX 670 2gb

and I have the 331.40 Beta drivers installed.

I don't understand, I can't even run this on Low.


(Sorry if this doesn't belong here)
 




 that was.. beautiful.. 




 So clean, looks awesome! 




 Can't wait to see what she/he looks like when it's all cleaned up! 




 Ugh, Mach 1 3 




 That is amazing. Very jealous. 




 The noises I made watching this weren't human.
Certainly WTF. 




 Well, R.I.P 




 Anytime! 




 Not every car has to be a "female" :P, good for you for being a nonconformist! He looks good. Congratulations! :D 




 It's okay, it's just a cupcake in your eye. 




 I just saw a dude fuck a baked chicken and cum into it.

Why does that even exist? 




 It has to be in my town, well then. 




 Ah that would explain it D:, hopefully one day you could give a few hundred more miles on it. It's a beauty!  




 Can someone explain why get a fast car but never drive it, not being rude, just curious why pay 60k for a car you never really drive.
Thanks!
(BTW, looks nice ;) ) 




 PC. You?
 




 Lucky, my family doesn't like to game with me.. :( 




 Awesome! 




 Lovely simple pony. 




 Beautiful. 




 Oh, so lucky. I wish I could find one around here for that. The only Mach 1 is a Zinc Yellow for 15k.
Anyways, very cool car, wish I could have one. 




 How much was it? 




 I am completely jealous of your Mach 1, it looks beautiful. 




 Can I be a fairy too? 




 Ouch, my feelings. 




 Yeah bro, cause a 5.0 isn't much. 









 "Daddy loved you"

Chills and feels.

Glad you're alive, even if its just for now.
