 What is the opinion of historians on the House Select Committee report that concluded that a conspiracy was more likely than not? If the lone gunman theory is so well supported, how did the House Committee go so far off the rails? 




 Not that I necessarily believe this "shipwrecked Indians" story, but is a canoe traversal from Greenland to Iceland, thence onwards to the Faroes or Orkneys and Scotland or Norway essentially impossible? Let's assume a well-stocked Inuit canoe that had just finished a large seal or walrus hunt was blown into the open ocean by a storm. They reach Iceland and then decide this was an intervention by "the gods" or something and decide to press on. Could they conceivably have survived and reached Europe? 









 The dudes who believed God was five feet tall and went around beating up Quakers? I love those guys! 




 There are a lot of accounts of meetings with human-like "Nordic" aliens in UFOs, who might be humans *pretending* to be aliens, but beware this will take you down the Esoteric Hitlerism/Nazi survival rabbithole, aka people who think "Iron Sky" is real. 









 The drug is pretty much a key plot element throughout the series though, so I wouldn't call it a deus ex machina. The "machina" at the end of Dune was of a more literal kind! 









 They also have a very singular rare books library. 

Ancient and rare mystical manuscripts housed in the NSA library? Now there's a good beginning to a pulp thriller novel.  









 Yes, it's impossible. The hypotenuse must be the longest side of a right triangle. 




 Triangle problems can be confusing when the labeling is unclear. Can you upload a picture of the problem?

Also, in the pythag. theorem, it's a^2 + b^2 = c^2. You seem to have b^2 as the isolated term, which might be your problem. 




 Me too, I just wake up. I've never experienced this void state. 




 Nothing bizarre happened, but there were some people roaming around very much alive who are very much dead in reality (relatives, etc.) The realism was pitch-perfect and even though I knew (correctly) that it was a dream, after a while I was convinced that I had somehow entered a parallel universe.

Anyone else ever done a reverse RC and convinced themselves that they were awake when they were really dreaming? 




 Wouldn't surprise me. I think the "changing text" RC is one of the least reliable. There's all kinds of pseudoscience about how the higher reasoning functions in your brain are deactivated during dreaming so you can't read coherently or form complex thoughts. I think there's *some* truth to this (my thinking is always muddy in dreams, even in Lucid Dreams), but the reading stuff is not supported by the first-hand experiences of people on this board and others. 




 Sooo... I was a female librarian in Siberia, in the year 450 AD 




 The theory is, you can read in lucid dreams, but when you check back the same text again, it's totally different. You're supposed to be able to do the same thing with clocks. I've never been able to test this, in my lucid dreams no text or clocks ever show up. 




 While we're at it... I don't think Sacha Baron Cohen is funny at all, and a Jewish guy making such vicious fun of Muslim/Arab cultures is more than a little icky in my book. 




 I would more say 1910-1997 









 Don't know then. I would see a doctor to make sure you don't have any heart defects and if you don't, then I wouldn't worry about it. The heart rate charts you see at the gym are only population averages, as others have pointed out, each individual is different. 




 although some stories even suggest it was a home for earlier Prophets, too.

That is interesting. What prophets were believed to have come before Abraham? 




 The dominant Labour Party was an offshoot of the early leftist Zionism, but (much like Britain's Labour Party) they quickly veered to slightly left of center.

You have a very long view of history if you think this was a "quick" process in either case!  









 Are you just using the heart-rate monitor on the cardio machine? Those are not very accurate. They'll pick up stray vibrations from the motion of the machine and interpret them as heartbeats. 



















 Louie is great, but it's a lot more serious and introspective than Seinfeld. The standup cut-outs are about the only thing the two shows have in common. 

Curb is I know by the same creator, but it just seems fundamentally different to me somehow. It's a creature of the reality-show age - Seinfeld, despite its postmodernism, wasn't. 





























 I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off. 

However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death. 




 A lot of info is from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Un-pharaon-republicain-Enquetes-Edition/dp/2733906143) (only in French, sorry). I don't know much about the reputation of the author as a historian, but some these sites described in the book do actually exist. 




 Several sources ranging from academic to downright dubious claim he though he had a literally divine mission to rule France, that he was outwardly a Socialist, but secretly part of a Fascist cult known as "The Hood," that he built an obelisk covered in Masonic symbols and would meditate beneath it at night, etc. etc.

It all sounds pretty crazy but unlike most other conspiracy theories this one seems to have some evidence behind it. What do you guys think?

 




 Tuition only covers part of the cost. Taxpayers pay the rest. 




 That's basically what I want to know - can these families be traced back to Roman forebears, are they barbarian families that were "Italianized" over time, or some combination of the two?

Or is their origin genuinely unknown due to the lack of historical records in that time period? 




 For the most part, we have government doing important stuff. 

Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented. 




 The breathing exercises, the sitting postures and some of the simpler standing postures can be verified back 1000+ years, though not back to the time of the Vedas.

The more gymnastic stuff is a modern concoction, as was recently shown in the NY Times (link is in the top comment.) Yoga shorn of its doctrinal, religious element is also a modern phenomenon, but you probably already knew that. 




 I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.

Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing. 




 TIL. I never had any idea such places existed. I figured Tom Hanks had to go to get his license renewed just like the rest of us. Any more info on these departments? I am curious. 




 Government is not 40% of GDP in the US. Maybe in some European countries. But your wider argument is valid. 




 Government work is about being compliant with rules, fair to all stake holders, and risk minimizing. 

I see no problem with parts of the economy being run on those lines. If it is the whole economy of course, that is a recipe for stagnation. But I also think that running the whole economy on the profit principle is a recipe for destruction. Call me a mushy moderate but I think a proper balance is necessary. 




 Unfortunately the Supreme Court doesn't see it that way. In my state, taxpayers already fund all the expenses of religious schools (mainly Catholic) except teacher salaries and *religious* textbooks. Everything else: Physical maintenance, other textbooks, transportation, even heating and air conditioning costs, are borne by the public. 




 Almost all folks in the government are sincere and trying to do a good job. And they do accomplish big, complex things. But when we bid on government work, we routinely doubled the time required.

Might that not be because of the very complexity of what government does, as opposed to, say, Starbucks? 




 Maybe so, but I've lived in a number of different areas (rural, suburban, urban), and not particularly wealthy areas either - and one or two were definitely downscale, and I've never had a bad experience at either place.

Contrast that with the hundreds of frustrations that I've had with private corporations' customer service makes me look askance at people who say government is always less efficient. 









 I haven't noticed much difference between any of the three on the receiving end. When choosing shipping I just use whatever's cheaper. When shipping things I always use the post office. They are a lot more knowledgeable and helpful in my experience (and cheaper too.) 




 Debt levels really aren't that extreme in Europe, the problem is there is now a disconnect between the people making fiscal policy (nations) and the people making monetary policy (the EU). 




 I've been to the DMV.

Me too, and I've never had any problems. In fact I'm impressed with how well they handle the volume and the complexity of what they do. Same with the post office. 









 All true, I've just never thought about it in terms of energy output per unit of volume before.  














 It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.

An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists. 




 Technically, the rule in Buddhist doctrine is "every *conditioned object* is impermanent." Nirvana is considered the "undying element" since it is not conditioned. 




 Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.

Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.

It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.) 




 here was the Holy Roman Empire, which kings were eventually elected, which seems counterintuitive considering how the system is generally known.

Yes, but only by a handful of noble "electors," not by the general population. 




 Awesome, I didn't realize I was a government! 




 They are products of the modern media culture where everything has to be over-the-top and confrontational. Bertrand Russell they are not. However, I am not too worked up over this. The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.

However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with. 




 I agree with you about Krauss, he really comes across as a charlatan. People who buy his book expecting a real answer to the Big Question are going to come away very disappointed. 




 Sure, I know some old white guys like that - blacks are "fine in their own way" but their culture is too different from ours and it would be better if we just split up into separate countries. They even say they like Malcolm X and guys like that because they also have the same beliefs (blacks and whites should be separate.)

They are just trying to make their racism seem more politically correct in my mind. But if you actually take them at their word, how would this ever be done? Can you imagine the chaos? It would be like the India-Pakistan partition times a thousand. And there are too many mixed-race people now for it to ever be practical.

Also I can guess which "country" would end up with all the economic and military resources. It wouldn't be the new "Negrostan." 




 I liked how the guy who said "you can tell I'm not Jewish just by looking at me" kinda looks like Adam Sandler. 




 Hey God, stop squeaking your chair! 




 The girls in the film have grown up now and have publicly renounced racism.  




 It makes a little more sense now, thanks. Relating it to something I know more about, it seems similar to using the Poisson distribution (where there are technically an infinite number of draws) to model a process that, while technically finite, is so large as to be practically infinite. 




 That last little bit of fat is good for you. Your body and especially brain need some fat reserves. I wouldn't freak about it as long as you feel good. 














 From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it. 




 Yes, the brain processes complex stimuli. Where I think consciousness differs from this processing activity is in the *presentation* of the stimuli as an immediate whole.

I would say that "the awareness that one exists" as a "self" is subjectivity, or at least the beginnings of it, not consciousness. I would say consciousness precedes self-awareness.  




 I think that better defines subjectivity rather than consciousness. Consciousness seems to be immediate apprehension of a complex set of stimuli, not a process.  














 That's not a glitch, that's a peek at the assembly code. 




 You are defining consciousness as a disconnect between two elements, one of which is already consciousness. 




 He might have, but it is far less likely. Choice of venue is important. Attacking an institution where one studied or was employed instead of random civilians is psychologically significant.  




 consciousness is merely a disconnect between the automatic operations and the conscious operations of the brain.

Not trying to pick on you, but that contradictory sentence right at the beginning of your post shows just how hard it is to get at any coherent idea of consciousness. 




 My friend once had a dream where she was given a phone number *and address* by the "reincarnation" of a friend of hers who had died (yikes...) 

To my eternal frustration, she never called and soon forgot the number!! 




 The immigration part is what's illegal. And $250/month would be well under minimum wage. Still doesn't stop a lot of people from trying. 




 The link, again, does not lead to a workplace or school shooting. Also:

as of April 2008 he was unemployed and had to face severe financial difficulties.

which sort of goes with what I have been saying.  




 The higher incidence being at least partly related to guns was part of my original point (and the author's). Smith was not a school/workplace shooter.

If Goh had stayed in Korea he probably would have committed suicide without harming others, as that is how social antagonism often plays out in that country. 




 They have been shown to have a much higher incidence in the US than in other countries, and for different motivations, that is, they are almost never *overtly* political like the recent killings in Norway and France were.

Of course Goh was a sociopath, but you can't ignore the culture either. His most likely inborn mental illness was exacerbated by his cultural context, whereas other contexts would have been more likely to ameliorate it.  




 Night-vision goggles have infrared light emitters that aren't supposed to be seen with normal vision. Given the amount of drug trafficking and associated military/police activity in Texas, I don't think this was an alien. It's not clear to me from the video what the figure's distance is and if it was downhill or not. 

Also, Brad Steiger is not an "image expert," he is an author and a journalist.  




 There was a clear motive of self-interest - revenge and regaining lost honor. Perhaps the oldest motivation for violence and killing that exists. Focusing on the "irrational" aspects of this case denies the strong forces of cultural determination that the author of the article pointed out. The workplace/school shooting is as much a product of modern culture as the duel was of the 18th Century and the lynching in the 19th. 




 True, but what you said was such mass violence isn't influenced by poverty. I think that's incorrect and the African bush wars are a very good example. 




 That's a US Army soldier wearing night-vision goggles. I don't see where it appears "gigantic" at all.  




 I disagree, especially when the "war" is more of a chaotic mass looting and killing for no reason. The media interprets events in Africa through the lens of "Genocide," one tribe trying to wipe out another. What goes unreported is how often these forces *attack their own side*. 




 Actually in places like Africa, spree killings are so common, they're almost an institution. Ever hear of a brush war? 














 I don't think it was a protest - at least a conscious one - but I do think it was an economic decision. People with low economic status have "less to lose" by such acts and thus do not have as strong a motivation to repress violent urges as others. 




 250 million guns aren't connected to our political culture? As for poverty, that is definitely both a cause and an effect of political culture. I don't see how population really has much to do with it. If you wanted a similar unit of comparison you could use the European Union which has 300 million plus population as well. 




 Would you deny that there is a link in general between the very high levels of violence in America as opposed to other industrialized countries and the political culture in the US? Because if you admit that link I think you would have to admit the link between mass killings and the culture as a special case thereof. 




 You should have read that link a little more carefully:

Not included are school massacres, workplace killings, hate crimes or familicides, which form their own categories.

Each culture has its own version of the "rampage" or the "beserker" which says something about the stresses of that particular culture. In America the workplace and school shootings are more common - in Europe and Africa, overtly political rampages are more common. Again, don't discount that book before you read it. 




 You should read the author's book "Going Postal." This is by no means an isolated incident. It is part of a repeated and widespread sociological pattern. That Goh had problems beyond what society can be blamed for is not the point. The point is instead of ameliorating or controlling those problems, Goh's social context exacerbated them until he exploded. He is the latest in a long list of workplace and school shooters. 




 Every society has its psychopaths, but how that psychosis manifests does say something about the society. The 9/11 attackers did *say something* about Muslim society - even though of course they didn't represent the views of most Muslims. Anders Brevik's killing spree did *say something* about the tradition of White Nationalism and Nazi sympathy in the Nordic countries, even though most Norwegians abhor his views, etc.

Likewise, Goh's shootings do *say something* about the pervasive culture of economic scams and hypocritical religion in the US, even though there is of course much more to the US than scams and fundamentalist hucksters. 



















 [Here's an interview with Shostak](http://www.astrobio.net/debate/3036/technology-worlds) where he goes more in-depth and mentions Seyfert galaxies. 




 The two top candidates for these kinds of structure are Hoag's Object (a strange galaxy where stars have been separated by type - no one knows how), and Seyfert Galaxies - badly disturbed galaxies that some have speculated are "industrial accidents" left behind by Type III civilizations.

The artificial nature of these structures is by no means proven, but some reputable astronomers have speculated in that direction. 




 There is a very long taboo in a lot of Buddhist groups about claiming attainments, because it would start endless arguments about who was really Enlightened, etc. This kind of attitude was learned through hard experience. On the other hand, being super-mysterious about it has its disadvantages as well. 




 Sounds like you have Sleep Paralysis. Sufferers often report experiencing an evil presence in the room with them, often slowly coming towards them. It's something to do with the brain's self/other perception going haywire.

If you don't mind me asking, what's so terrifying about this "ghost"? It can't be appearance, since you describe it as a cartoonish "bed-sheet ghost." 




 No, but sometimes a dog is following me and I think I've dropped my keys 




 Imagining exercise might cue the body to think that exercising is immanent, cuing increased heart rate, etc., just like imagining food can cause salivation. But yeah, I'd like to see a source too. It seems like that would be too weak of an effect to result in any noticeable weight loss. I could see where an ill-controlled study that didn't monitor subjects' eating habits might see that effect - if you imagine exercise every night you might become more health-conscious and change your eating habits. 




 Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.

Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing. 




 Depends when you date the beginning of the Civil War. 




 The U.S. and Canada got away with it.

And the British Empire. Read the book "The Victorian Holocaust." They killed more people in India alone than Hitler did in all the places he conquered. Of course, they had a lot longer to get the killing done. Mainly they used deliberate starvation like Stalin, but they weren't above gassing people either (Churchill suggested that the Kurds should be eliminated by gassing their villages- Saddam wasn't the one to think of that first.) 




 Quite eye-opening. The dialectic of White Nationalism eventually leads the thoughtful racist to sympathize with the Indians (!), and equate his own ancestors with today's globalists. 




 Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.  

They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:

Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.

Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)

In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.

Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.

By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres. 

However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...

take it from there!

 




 I haven't read that but I did read "Young Stalin" by the same author. It actually prompted my question as it had a number of incidents of Stalin acting in a very reckless manner that could be suggestive of psychosis or clinical paranoia. 




 Yes, I think that's where I heard it too. Great show. 




 I've heard this story too. Apparently this happened back in Georgia. He was with some fellow Bolsheviks and he wanted to prove his toughness and mercilessness so he killed the animal (in the version I heard, he strangled it.) I'm not sure how much validity this story has or where I heard it. 




 Yes, I know he did a lot of that early on in his rule. I'm more thinking of later on, the Great Terror and later, all the people who died shouting "long live Stalin!" and actually meant it. Did Stalin think those people had secretly betrayed him (clinical paranoia), or was he killing people he knew to be loyal for some other reason? 




 Don't forget the "Blues," the supporters of the Provisional Government! 




 Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.

Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.

Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.

In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness. 



















 According to something I saw on TV, you can do this in Baltimore just by asking people to say the name of the city! Not sure how accurate or scientific this is however.

 Numbers like 24, 60 and 360 are useful because they have lots of factors. That is, there are lots of ways to subdivide them without remainder. That is one reason these numbers show up a lot in calculating everyday things like time and angle.

 That would be my suggestion. I'm on the other side of the fence and topology has always baffled me! 




 If you are considering math grad school, you will probably see plenty more of both. Are you more of an algebra/stats person or a geometry/physics person? 



















 I had this practice described to me though I haven't tried it myself. Basically, your read alternating chapters of works from opposing points of view (materialism vs. dualism, right-wing vs. left-wing politics, etc.). 

This supposedly avoids the effect of reading the books in sequence (first one and then the other) and being convinced either by the first or the last one you read, depending on your disposition.

Also you are supposed to see hidden connections, points of agreement or common flaws that the two arguments share. 









 Not for Central Banks, there it's the opposite.  









 I am more thinking, long-term, the team worst off in this new system is the one that shares a division with the Yankees. 









 Until very recently it was a good move as the pay is often a lot better. There is a "special needs" teacher at our district who is assigned to just a single student. The teacher's sole job is to follow this student around all day, and slap her hand back when she tries to touch things/people. Oh, and a bit of paperwork every 6 months. She makes more than twice the salary of a regular teacher.

However, if our state follows NY and some bureaucrat decides that this student needs to take the state standardized tests, this teacher is out of a job.  




 I go out of the way to use examples that involve pop culture, drugs, booze, speak the same way as my students

Advice from someone who's been on the job a bit longer than you have, perhaps: There is nothing more uncool than the "cool teacher." This does not earn you respect from the students. 









 I don't really care one way or the other, but I know the Red Sox can't be too happy with it. 





























 Well, as long as you're happy with it, more power to you! 




 Casios are terrible. If you can, just get a TI. You will keep having this problem with everything shown in class. 









 They also knew (and in Hawaii, still know), how the behavior of waves changes over seamounts (elevated sections of the seafloor that don't break the surface.) Islands are more likely to be found near seamounts. 









 So this article is just about these guys sitting at home and being depressed? I was expecting that the "impenetrable silence" hid some massive underground super-banking conspiracy. Oh well... 




 Often in science-fiction there are plot points revolving around mining the moon, Mars, asteroids, etc. What mineral resources, if any, are actually known to exist on these bodies?  









 A friend of mine had a dream like this: She dreamed that a friend of hers - who had actually died in real life at 16 - appeared and told her she had been reborn as a baby in Italy, and gave the name of the town and the street address and everything.

Now I don't believe in reincarnation or anything, but I would have at least looked up that address when I woke up! My friend however, just wrote it off as a "weird dream" and never looked up the address. She said she remembered it for some time, but by the time she told me about the dream, she had forgotten everything about it except that it was somewhere in Italy. 




 Isn't this illegal in the US? I remember a similar site being shut down last year because "peer-to-peer" lending violated American banking regulations. Have they found a way around this? 



















 Very good explanation. Thanks! 




 Interesting, I am not really familiar with model theory. I am confused as to how if you only have the symbols 0,1,+,x,, how you can get anything other than whole numbers anyway. 

Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.) 




 Thanks for the reply. I understood the first paragraph but kind of lost you in the second. I've been through Analysis but it's been a while. Maybe time to dust off the old notes...
