 "MOVE! GET OUT THE WAY! I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!" 














 I remember when he didn't have the Mr. Fusion on the back, nor the ... ?coolant tubes/wires? on the doors.  I was stoked to see him finally get them made to be on there.  Seeing him add onto it more and more over the years has been fun. 




 Oh, no.  I know this guy.  I see him all over Baton Rouge, LA.  Hope it's a flat, and not something more... sinister.  I love seeing his car around town. 




 She's too.... cute.  Psyloche should be a... sultry, hot woman.  




 Had them chronically in high school. Both big toes.  I was in the marching band.  The roll-stepping of marching band suuuuucked with my toes. 




 It's sickening that the server got $7k for serving a normal table super-expensive wine/champagne.

It's not like that shit is served any different than the $12 bottle of liquor.  Percentage tipping--especially forced tipping--is so stupid. 




 Best laugh since ["Dad at Comedy Barn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Y4keqTV6w).

 This is an extremely common occurrence... why do people keep posting these pics? 




 LMFAO!!! 




 That's creepy as hell.

Not to mention Bina48's derp face from time to time. 




 Ugh--same here.  I can't stand that shit. 




 Hurr-dee-durr... 




 The "Chewbacca" thing had me laughing.  Haha!  Thanks for that! 




 The blacks in my area were ALL about the first-black-President agenda.  I promise you.  That's all we heard. 




 I bet everyone will jump on the First-Female-President bandwagon just like they did the First-Black-President bandwagon. 




 "Good trade. Thanks!" 




 Into my own bank account. We pay too much as it is.

We're taxed when we earn money (income tax) AND when we spend it (sales tax). 




 Down.  The little lip on the steps would be a tripping hazard if the cat were going "up".

 Are you in the business, or did you randomly get mailed?

Their local rep came by our office, but all we got was an stress-reliever "ass" to squeeze, and some pens.  ***LOL*** 




 Yep, I actually specified the [**Haiku**](http://www.bigassfans.com/products/haiku/) for a job a few months ago.

The biggest one I've specified was for a distribution warehouse.  It was the [**Powerfoil 8**](http://www.bigassfans.com/products/powerfoil-8/). 




 What the hell am I looking for/at? 




 I do electrical design, and I will never forget the first time I heard of this manufacturer over the phone.

"We want to use a Big Ass Fan."

"Haha-yeah, you need a big one."

"No, it's called a Big Ass Fan.  That's who makes them."

"Wait--seriously?  HAHAHA!" 




 "Official" my ass. 




 I hate it when Hulu does that!  




 Glad to hear I'm not the only one. 




 With the exception of The Flash, I haven't found a CW show I actually like.

The Flash has a little of the cheese added on top, but it fits with the characters, and isn't distracting... Except for Iris... she's a moron. 




 Couldn't agree more about The Arrow.  Finished Season 2 on Netflix, but not sure I care anymore to watch Season 3. 




 I just finished S1E2, and I'm wondering if it's worth it.

Told my wife, who was watching it with me, that the acting and dialogue is like that of a CW show.  Turns out, I was right.  HAHA!

tl;dr -- Should I watch this show? 




 "It's impossible for a minority to be racist." 




 Even more true...

We're all just electrons migrating from the Big Bang. 




 Heh-true. 




 Yep.  Everyone except central-Africans are immigrants. 




 Holy shit!  This is amazingly accurate!

 Without a doubt!  I remember crying manly tears bestowed from the Rock Gods when I saw that performed live on television.

 Okay, that was pretty damn funny.  Haha!  Thanks! 




 I had a plumber tell me that the only "flushable wipe" that won't screw up your plumbing system is toilet paper.

These things labeled as "flushable wipes" keep him quite busy with unclogging toilets and pipes.

Have fun. 




 There--now I have!  Thanks! 




 This is why the internet needs a "sarc-mark". 




 CPS needs to take that kid into protective custody. Damn. 




 The something of Prince Phillip...? 




 Yes, public transportation works in cities where everything is clumped together.

I live in Baton Rouge, LA, and everything we need to get to is spread out somewhat.  I also have to go to meetings a lot--sometimes at the drop of a hat.

Public transportation doesn't work well for me, or my city. 




 This wasn't "WILD", there was no "chase" to be seen, and I have no idea what "distance" you're talking about.  This isn't even "funny", so it doesn't belong in /r/funny.

 Holy crap!  How much does ***THAT*** cost?!

It's like a real-life, old-school, color-changing Hot Wheel!  HAHA!

 Unless they are extremely over-the-top, these "reaction to _____" videos are a waste of harddrive space. 




 I keep telling my sister--who is a smoker--that it ages you prematurely.  She doesn't agree (of course). 




 Wow, your great-grandmother looks amazing!  She looks younger than your grandmother!  Your grandmother a smoker? 




 Ah, interesting.  Thanks! 




 I never understood how they can "bathe" in dirt....

 Yep--they were all normal for me. 




 Man, The Sims has gotten weird since I stopped playing after The Sims 2. 




 A pass; no. Flirt; yes.

I ignored it as best I could. She was 14yo. LOL  Didn't want to embarrass her. 




 Way too much time put into this lame-ass Rick-Roll. 




 "...E-Elsa...?" 




 That's what I thought (and did). I guessed correctly!  




 I know! He's an awesome priest! 




 It's my name as well. Hehe! 




 Baton Rouge, LA diocese.

St. Stephen the Martyr 




 We have a new priest this year, and he uses incence.  I am a convert, and have never dealt with it.

After blessing the consecration, he turns to the congregation, bows, blesses each side, and bows again.

My question: Do I bow the first time; as he blesses me; or the last bow?  Do I make the sign of the cross?  Do I do nothing?

I'm so confused, and it appears the majority of the congregation is as well based upon their responses.  Haha! 




 Well, guess it DID have enough spin. Didn't appear as such, but you were there. Cool! I thought the runner AND catcher did great jobs! 




 Anyone under the age of 18... 




 I agree. I mainly posted it for the song. 




 Cool, but kind of a one-trick pony. Can only do wailing notes... not shredding. 




 Yes. I was an usher in a previous job. 




 You owe me a beer.

[Here is the video.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9ameb_celebs-topless-yulia-volkova-of-tat_redband ved=0CBwQtwIwAA usg=AFQjCNHnW5wueKlDIPSvtuJgYsf4exIzxg sig2=Eheqcj0XaycBFIarWwRdkg) 




 Not as bad as I would have thought, actually.

I'd have to move though, as I live in Baton Rouge, LA. 




 The ball was bouncing very low to the ground, and hits a wall.  Not sure what would make it pop up 3-4' in the air. 




 The angle(s) don't seem to be right for that to happen. 




 That red-head was so hot back then.  I can't remember the video, but there was one where she was practically naked on a bed.  Damn. 




 Hey, man, at least you're writing original music!  Keep it up! 




 I think you meant: [*"Where tha white women at?"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=493pL_Vbtnc) 




 My 15 year old would do awesome on this one.  My wife and I were born in '81, and we play 90's music all the friggin' time! 









 [...whoa...](http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/black-people-reaction-to-magic.gif) 




 I'll stick with Spotify.  Tidal is sponsored/backed by several artists I can't stand.  It also REQUIRES a "30-day" trial (i.e., there is no free service with commercials).  I'm not giving you my credit card number to get a 30-day trial.  Screw you. 




 Whether the jump was "illegal" or not, I'm glad the umpire called him safe for one reason:

Someone tossed the loose ball back to the catcher instead of making him scramble for it.  The runner probably would've been safe otherwise. 









 "Omlette du formage." 




 I totally had some of those toys! They were awesome.  




 I didn't... maybe you just suck at Pac-Man...?

 It's apparently all over Pearl Jam's community forum from someone who knew her from a  Facebook group or something. 




 I loved these shorts!  They were some of my favorites.

There was also a counting short that used colored sand to create an African vibe.  The background singing was something like, "uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding; uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding..."

For the life of me, I can NOT find that video anywhere... or find someone who remembers it. 




 I actually prefer the [knuckle/gap method](http://ehealthbook.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/days-in-month.jpg) for months.  Much easier. 




 In his defense, he probably can't see worth shit.  LOL 




 This "Kim" woman apparently died very recently from an illness.  Must be why this video popped up again. 




 I agree.  A little too much hype for this video too. 




 Didn't notice... now I have an excuse to re-watch it.  Hehehehe!

Edit: Pretty sure she's wearing a bra under her cut-off. 




 I so want to see them!  No one comes to Louisiana anymore... ever... 









 Cool song with a cool video! 




 Maybe you should blame your math teachers for shorting you on your education. 




 I was never told during my time in RCIA (I am a convert) that one is supposed to maintain silence on Good Friday.  Huh... go figure. 




 Ha! Brilliant!  




 Haha!  Good work, /u/mardfet! 




 Because publishers, production companies, etc. only exist to make a profit. 




 I know!  I tell my wife this all the damn time. 




 This is where they are:

 So you do agree that they aren't legit? 









 Plot holes and inconsistencies galore. 




 This.

 He didn't do shit.
