 Cheaper oil

Some places suck the oil out of the fill hole instead of draining it out of the drain hole of the pan.  Which means any metal shavings in the vehicle will either be left in the oil pan or pulled up through the motor and not drained.

 




 You gasp, snort, snore, or whatever other noise once your airway becomes obstructed and you wake up enough to open it back up.

Deviated septum is going to give you less options on masks to treat your apnea, since most of the nose ones probably won't give you enough air passage to be comfortable.

Tonsils removed may make a difference, they have surgeries where they basically scar your throat to make it less likely to droop and obstruct your airway.  I dont know what the surgery is called off the top of my head.  So tonsil removal MIGHT have some aspect of that surgery included in it, you might even ask if they could do both.

Friend of mine had his tonsils out, it didn't do away with his apnea and need for the machine.  Another had his deviated septum fixed and it cured up a lot his allergy problems, but he didn't have apnea to begin with.    Apnea is typically an obstruction in your throat once you fall asleep your skin basically droops and forms like a little suction/vacuum there that your brain interprets as suffocating and wakes you up which causes the muscles and tissue to firm back up and you gasp/snore/clear your throat/whatever weird animal grunting noise you make.
 




 Oh and all masks have "weaknesses" besides fit.  Some the cushions wear out super fast.  With the entire face mask, the headstraps lose their ability to hold on the "loop" side of the velcro and it's a mask you gotta put on kinda tight to make it flex to fit your face on some people.
 




 I will say that from my support groups, most people dont tolerate nasal pillows beyond like a 12-15 pressure.  It's too much air being forced into your nose and nasal passages and really dries you out.  Very few people beyond a 15 can use them, very very very few.  Even the people who sell them dont suggest them at high pressures.  

If you're at that high of pressure, I might even question some of the around the nose masks.  My brother has low pressure, but he uses what I'd call an entire face mask.  It basically covers from above your eyebrows down to just above your chin.  It allows your body heat to help keep the air warm due to all the surface area on your face and doesn't feel like you've got cold air behind forced up your nose...and helps with eye irritation since if it leaks you're not having it blow into your eyes like on nearly every other mask.

I can't recall the name of it right now, but I think respironics or resmed makes it.  It has the inlet tube on the side for central sleep apnea machines.  Im not sure if the bipap needs to use that tube or not.  

I personally use around the nose masks....I've tried the entire face mask a few times, but could never get comfortable with it sleeping on my side.  If you're a back sleeper it should be pretty awesome.


 




 I see now.

But since Im here and something else I remembered came up.

Having untreated sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and over time can cause circulatory system issues.  You're basically suffocating, your brain responds by going into fight or flight and wakes up you, gives you little BP spikes all night and little spurts of adrenaline potentially.  So your veins eventually begin to harden prematurely because it's like you spend all your nights in near constant "fight or flight" and you're body is not meant for that.

That is how it was explained to me in a cpap support group.


That might be what your doctor is getting at, I'd just ask him to explain what's up.  Some of the CPAP clinics are not very good about supporting their patients, they just shove hardware in your hand and often times dont even teach you how to adjust it properly for good fit.
 




 You're 37 now, tried it at 18.  So that's nearly 20 years.  The machines improve alot in just 5 years...so you probably had something more akin to a vacuum cleaner than a current day cpap back then.   That's how they made the first cpap machines, reversed vacuum cleaner motors.

Heated tube helps prevent rain out, where drops form in the mask and tube and then drip on your face or collect in the tube and gurgle causing pressure loss.

Or you can get tube wraps that help insulate it as a cheaper solution.

Dry mouth is opening mouth, or humidity.......I USUALLY set my humidity about 3 and do fine until it's freezing cold in the winter then I need to crank it up to 5 and then run out of water during the night.  So if you are running out of water the humidifier won't do a whole lot....if your tank is empty in the morning it could explain dry mouth and there isn't a lot you can do about it if you are filling your tank to the fill line.
 




 I would have never guessed how to pronounce "Sloughing", saw it in books, etc..  But never registered the way it sounds when someone says it with the actual word for quite awhile.  Which it's pronounced something like "Sluffing".


And seeing on diet websites, the word "Satiety", I expect more letters for how it sounds or something.
 




 Nope, I feel like nice clothes never fit me comfortably and I feel out of place wearing them.  But Im fat so......that's part of it. 




 I can relate, Im 36 years old.  Although I will add one big factor of it is feeling alone/lonely.  People really don't want to hear about your shit, or you perceive they don't want to hear about your shit.  If the off chance you do find someone to kind of unload on, and it feels better, they will start feeling the same way too and then either have to get away from you or end up like you.  Then you drop to an even lower level of "why the fuck bother"ness.

Told my parents about my feelings less than a handful of times and I could tell they didn't get it or thought even less of me for it.  So I don't do that anymore.  I really can't say that I believe my therapist understands that deep self loathing, apathy, and loneliness that comes along with everything else.  

My best description of mine would be that the universe/fate/god/whatever will make anything I attempt to do fail or turn out worse for me.  As has historically been the case.  So why would I want to tempt that "force" and try to be "better" when I know Im just going to end up worse off.

I'm really tempted to put a "deadline" on my life, get fixed or get dead by age X.  I told myself for years and years I would die/kill myself by 35.  Here I am 36 and any little bit of happiness I have ends up leaving or being taken away. 

The whole "behaviorism" aspect of psychology is ....... really the wrong way to approach people who have similar thinking to me.  Because I am an convinced that my behavior is in defense of my life being even worse and that's the only thing that can come of trying.  And behaviorism tries to teach you that your behavior is not working, so you should change type...basically.  It's just complete opposite IMO, you're basically trying to convince an atheist to become religious or vice versa with words.
 




 Welp I'd be interested in talkin if ya want. 




 Yeah I used to read, but started doing more audiobooks since I find I can do some mundane tasks with the book going.  So I always wonder how you really review an audiobook to be useful for improvement....I can see a few parts.

- Same reader throughout a series, doesn't matter if they aren't the most popular.  Switching them up is just annoying unless you've found some kind of magical replacement that improves on everything and still keeps the pronunciations and things the same.

- Pronunciations, bugs me sometimes.

- A lot of characters with names that start with the same sounds.  Stephen, Stephanie...lots of S names and it starts to become really hard to track whose talking unless the guy reading does some killer voice work.

Can probably think of more, but just kind of giving some idea of there being aspects JUST for the audiobook and then things that make the story muddy that can be brought into the audiobook that the text might not give the reader....S names, weird pronunciations of what you THOUGHT it sounded like.

James Marsden on the Dresden Files audiobooks does some awesome work, I think he enhances the story so much more with how he does the reading.  Then one book they didnt use him and I couldn't listen to it, had to read it so I could at least try to hear his voices in my head while I read.

Im really not even sure how much power the author has over audiobook decisions in general.  

And I must confess I am not familiar with your writing by just character names being mentioned.
 




 Not disagreeing with you, but I think authors should strive to keep some consistency and it should be recognized as something they should be doing.

It kind of falls under "I writer's responsibility is to only release a book that they feel is worth a readers time and money."  bullet point but when it comes to series I expect them to have some consistency/continuity to them.   There's sort of an implied contract that a fantasy series is going to stay a fantasy series, and not become some weird erotica story based vaguely on your popular series to cash in or fill a quota your publisher set.

Eventually the word and practice will catch up to the author and make it hard to get people to buy their books, but if we're talking morality here, bait and switch/whatever is basically cheating you out of your money based on a good faith history.  Since if you could read the whole book and know what was in it, you wouldn't need to buy it.    If it becomes a "thing authors do in this industry", you are starting a spiral downward on whose to blame for why people need to wait to buy books like it is with video games now for many people.

Hopefully Im coming across here.  Kinda tired.
 




 Im not advocating piracy or anything by saying this, but I think there should be a caveat or......like a third bullet point to cover the instances where authors writing a series go waaaay off the path in the story line.  

Im not going to name anyone specific or a series because I dont want to start that argument, but there is one specific series I have in mind where the series became more about the main character having sex than it did about story.  And that was.....half a dozen or more books into the series.

Now that may be covered under bullet 2, but I think it needs to be pointed out.  That a series should still fit within some semblance of the previous books or it's a fairly big slap in the face to the reader IMO.  

Delays and things potentially can't be helped, but I just can't forget that WTF moment in that series when I was trying to figure out what percentage of the book was sex scenes and how many pages that left of actual story.
 




 And, I think the length drove off anyone who might even attempt to help.  Heh.  Well thanks whoever else upped it.
 




 Your sister is awesome. 




 You are spectacular.  Glad you posted again just so I could see the history.......whew. 




 Kind of depends on the activity for me.  If it's something social, I spend a lot of time analyzing what people say and wondering if it's really as negative as it seemed or meant to be negative or.... or...  and what people think of me and if I should even be there because none of them really like me.


If it's like watching movie at a friends house, usually not to bad unless it's a particularly bad depression day for me...then I wonder if they are just being nice and really want me to leave.


But I haven't hung out with friends in ......a long time now.  A year or more, so I dont even know if they'd still be considered friends.
 




 Pretty sure a plane is considered to be under the laws of the nation it leaves until it's touched down someplace else.  Something along those lines....  since they have to have something in place for transporting prisoners..air marshals etc.
 




 Is the mask coming off, like not fitted well and slipping above your head?  Or are you waking up and taking it off and not remembering?  Like it's someplace unlikely to be if it had just slipped off.

I know that benadryl gives me anxious dreams and makes it hard to sleep.  You take a lot of allergy meds and they might have some affect similar to that of benadryl on me.


I found that with my mask, just clearing my nose with a neti pot or a nose spray or something will allow me to be fine with my allergies until morning due to the filtration and humidity.


It COULD simply just be that the mask you have isn't right for you.  Isn't big enough, too big, or just isn't comfortable enough.  There's a number of full face masks, and there's even one that looks like a fire fighter mask and goes above your eyes and around to just below your bottom teeth.  My brother uses one of the fire fighter masks just because he couldn't find a mask he liked that was smaller. 




 You have a nice body.  Im a tits guy myself, so, enjoying those.
 




 Hotness. 




 I spend unhealthy amounts of time on here looking at girls......you have absolute nothing to be ashamed about.
