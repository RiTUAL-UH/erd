 I'd rather she have the power to direct justice, treasury, the sec and other regulatory organizations.  I don't trust Hillary to get those appointments right or set priorities --- *at all*. 




 At one point, tax rates as low as we have were unthinkable.  Things change. 




 Your jokes are funny.  Please tell more. 




 And the biggest socialist giveaway of all: free protection for property "rights".  Let's give all those socialist-trough feeders, like judges and the police, the boot. 




 The verbatim title from HuffPo front page. 




 As it should be. 
























 She's been [advocating these things](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/9/elizabeth-warren-demands-jail-time-wall-st-bankers/ ), but ultimately the call is in the hands of the DoJ and the SEC.  Obama's picks in those posts have dropped the ball.  Warren has brought legislation and publicly shamed the regulators.  What else can she do in her position? 




 It would be much better if everyone were quiet and let both parties do the bidding of Wall Street in peace, right?   Good thinking! 




 She didn't say things because they're popular - she's been on these issues way before anyone else.

[She warned about the collapse of the middle class in 2008. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A)

[She spearheaded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau back in 2011.]( http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/11/elizabeth-warren-201111 )

So much misinformed comment here in this thread.
 




 What is she specifically proposing that you think isn't enough?  My sense is that she wanted meaningful penalties for banks and banking criminals - like jail time, hefty fines and stricter oversight.  What do you think is missing? 




 Something that no one uses? 




 This Reagan/GHWB advisor is a delusional leftist too.  http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2011/08/05/Obama-The-Covert-Conservative-Liberals-Have-to-Love 









 Did you read the article? 









 I thought he was largely right.

 Are you saying that monopsonies are ok?  It's uncontroversial (i.e., it's taught in first year economics) that monopsonies don't allocate resources efficiently.  Here's a [primer](http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd c=dsp k=monopsony,+efficiency ).

 




 He addresses that, doesn't he?

 Which brings us back to the key question. Dont tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is. 



















 [Krugman talks about that here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html):

 Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.

 Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.

 **So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economys persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices.** And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economys weakness.

 




 Warren is arguably one of them.  Not sure how much progress she can make by herself.  The conversation needs to change.  I think that's what she's trying to force the Ds to do.  (Focus on core economic issues, not distract people with social ones, like the Clintons/Obama). 




 Which would include almost all Republicans and Democrats, and certainly our soon-to-be Queen Hillary. 




 Because Republicans don't want to talk about [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2jrpsa/this_year_an_analysis_by_the_new_york_times_shows/ ). 




 The [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ) has much better data (see Figures 10   11).  This chart the WaPo concocted is meaningless and poorly interpreted. 

 




 Yeh, it's pretty clear that both parties are doing it.  The Democrats have been taken over by carpet bagging globalists like the Clintons who get the votes of the rank-and-file by pushing left wing social issues.  The Republicans have always catered to the rich and sell their message using (now discredited) trickle down economics and right wing social issues.

So it could be argued that Warren is incorrect and just banging the partisan drums.  However, an alternative view  is that she's repositioning and rebranding the Democratic party - away from the ideas of Clinton/Obama and towards *economic* left wing issues.  Speeches like this make it harder for Clinton to maneuver.  If Democrats are supposed to be unrigging the system, it'll make it uncomfortable for Clinton to say things like ["lobbyists are people too"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA).  

The question is - could Warren just be honest and start attacking half the Democratic party as out of touch and beholden to Wall Street interests?  That would be the truth.  Why did Obama keep the roster of Rubinites and banker-apologists in power at Justice, the SEC and Treasury?   We already know that Warren dislikes them - she's been directly opposed to many of the policies they've instituted.  

There are essentially two choices: call out conservative Democrats and split the party in two, or attract a following and side line them.  Warren is clearly choosing the latter, and I think it's the right choice.  Nader, as much as I agree with him, took the first road, and look where that got him. 



















 The mishmash graphic that WaPo created and what they're trying to assert is in fact wrong, as you point out... which makes the title (sorry, verbatim copy) wrong as well.

However, take a look at the [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf), and a couple of the key charts:

* [High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)

* [College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png)

 




 [Original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf).

[High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)

[College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png) 









 You know what, I think you are reading the graphic correctly and I was reading it incorrectly.  So, it's true that poor college grads end up in the top two quintiles 40% of the time, whereas rich drop outs end up in the top two quintiles 19% of the time.  

Why the hell did they include the left axis?  That is so damn confusing.

But as I said, this is a terrible comparison anyway.  The actual published charts tell the story much more clearly.  It's hard to argue with Figures [10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png) and [11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png).  

Poor drop outs are 3.4 times more likely to end up in the bottom quintile (Figure 10).  Meanwhile, poor college grads are just over half as likely to end up in the top quintile compared to rich college grads.  That doesn't sound like a meritocracy, does it?

 




 **EDIT** Realized I'm *totally* wrong about this.  See [my comment later in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2josjx/poor_kids_who_do_everything_right_dont_do_better/cldtuef ).

- - - - - -
That commenter has simply misread the graphic. Specifically 19% of rich high school dropouts are not in the top **40%** (as claimed), rather *they are in the top* **20%**.  

On top of this, only 20% of poor college grads make it to the top 20%.  

I.e., *a rich high school dropout has as much of a chance of getting to the top 20% as a poor guy who slogged through college.*

Now, I'll grant that this is a pretty crappy chart, but it seems to have been cobbled together by WaPo.  For a more informative view of the data, take a look at [figures 10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png ) and [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png ) in [the original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ).

Pretty clearly, being a rich goof is better than being a diligent poor.
 









 Have you ever been to a startup conference?   Almost every single person there is from the upper middle class.

 **Submission Statement**

This is an interview with the author of a new book on the food industry: "The Spam Factory's Dirty Secret".  Although this doesn't go into depth on the origins of the disease the factory workers experience, it made me wonder --- could this be a porcine-form of Creutzfeld-Jakob/bovine spongiform encephelopathy aka mad cow disease?  It's horrifying that this might be transmitted through the misty of brain particles the workers are exposed to on a daily basis. 









 Au contraire - in fact, the author is quite liberal, and once wrote a column which appeared in WaPo during the Bush years called "White House Watch".  It so pissed off the Neocon editorial staff there that [the WaPo ombudsman was forced to address the controversy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000938.html ):

 Political reporters at The Post don't like WPNI columnist Dan Froomkin's "White House Briefing," which is highly opinionated and liberal. They're afraid that some readers think that Froomkin is a Post White House reporter.

 














 I think issues like this and [similar](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/11/01/reddit_politics_r_politics_mods_ban_mother_jones_others_for_bad_journalism.html ) [problems](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/11/censorship-costs-reddit-thousands-of-readers.html ) [in /r/politics](http://www.salon.com/2014/02/28/why_reddit_moderators_are_censoring_glenn_greenwalds_latest_bombshell_partner/ ) ought to be raised directly to [Reddit's CEO](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=yishan).   u/kn0thing has been outspoken in defense of internet freedom - could we get him to weigh in? 




 On the contrary, it's precisely a lack of imagination that causes people to think that Turing machines are capable of consciousness.  It's akin to saying that nuclear power exists when we simulate a nuclear power plant in a computer.

 PS; DR. 




 The title says "separate system", but my actual proposal is only for a special prosecutor.   That's a well-accepted way of dealing with conflict-of-interest situations in our judicial system. 




 You should read beyond the title. 




 Point taken.  See my edit in the self post. 




 **EDIT** [madronedorf](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/2ijqtx/there_needs_to_be_a_separate_system_of_justice/cl2vauy ) points out I did a pretty crappy job with the title.  I should have written **"There needs to be a special prosecutor for police misconduct"**.

---
The outcome many expected - [no charges for anyone in the SWAT team that blew a hole in a baby with a flash bang](http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/no-charges-for-officers-in-botched-drug-raid-that-/nhc2N/?__federated=1 ) - has come to pass.  I know many people are angry seeing cops commit horrific crimes and get away with no charges again and again.  Yet, though this issue is  finally starting to get coverage in the wider media, few speak about one of the most obvious causes of the problem.

Our current system requires that police are prosecuted by people who are essentially their colleagues.  Prosecutors rely on the testimony and cooperation of the police, so they have a strong motivation, if they want success and good relations with them in the future, to find reasons not to prosecute what are obviously crimes.  This   conflict of interest, has resulted in a lack of accountability which has allowed police culture to evolve in an increasingly violent direction.

Police brutality is a symptom of a structural problem.  Getting angry and demanding an end to bad police behavior, or demanding that police be prosecuted for one or another particularly horrendous beating, torture or murder won't solve the problem in the future.  We can't demand that the special relationship between prosecutors and police just magically go away.  It can't if they are to be effective at doing their jobs.  

The only solution, it seems, is to delegate independent prosecutors who are tasked solely with prosecuting police.  What do you think of this? Is there enough work for each state to have their own police prosecutor, or are there reasons for this function to be kept at the Federal level.  Who would this office report to to avoid political pressure being used to neuter the office?

 














 I still don't get it.
 




 I am totally confused by your comment, then.

 So two mutually contradictory motivations in the design of this coin, right?

a) grow the network (good self-interest)
b) prevent others from competing with you (bad self-interest)

Every other coin has (a) going for it.  The problem with this coin is that because of (b), in the long run, it's not going to do as well as others.  IMO, it's a basic design flaw. 




 Less competition.

 Signing statements are but one aspect of executive power.

But still, I am wrong and you are right.  Obama has used executive *orders* less than Bush.  

Yet, EOs have been declining steadily since at least Jimmy Carter (contrary to what all of us  in this thread probably suspected):  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/10/how-obama-has-used-executive-powers-compared-to-his-predecessors/
 




  hey say "oh, the last person did it, so our guy can do it!" that's not how justice works.

I could not agree more.  I've totally lost respect for Ds who went silent on Obama after criticizing Bush on the exact same issues.  

 I agree, but i honestly think it's both sides

On issues of secrecy, surveillance and executive power, both sides are equally bad.  Obama is arguably worse on all of these issues, having expanded the Cheney doctrine (which the Neocons have gleefully complimented him on).  However, if we're talking about economic issues, the Democrats are very slightly better.    If we're talking about social issues, the Democrats win hands down.  If we're talking about the base, the Democrats have a feeble bunch of half-hearted partisans who are largely rational and have most of the very tiny number of rational unbiased voters, whereas the Republicans have a bunch of super passionate batshit-crazy partisans.  









 Actually, I agree, he's pretty bad, even worse than Bush on some issues (executive power, surveillance, at al).  But boy are conservative complainers a bunch of hypocrites. 









 A quick guide to the Obama scandals:
http://i.imgur.com/aWqDFPZ.jpg 




 OMG that video was excellent.  Now I understand. 




 Honestly cannot tell whether sarcasm or actual wingnut rant.
 




 Terrific analysis.  I hadn't heard that before. 




 I know some like that too, and don't have a ton of sympathy for them.  But I think it's important to look at the big picture.  At the macro level  the middle class is working harder, longer hours, being more productive, and getting paid less.  George Bush said it well when [he complimented a woman on having 3 jobs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ).  "That is uniquely American, isn't it?"

Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.  Owning capital means you get rewarded with profit on work someone else did.  And our society is increasingly becoming one where it pays better to own than work.   




 Thank you so much for that.  This was driving me bananas. 




 Thank you for that response. Could you elaborate on Krugman saying individuals ought not to own capital? I've never heard that from him... honestly, that would surprise me a bit.

I read the Murphy piece, but I'm a bit skeptical.  He seems to be driving at his conclusions because he's upset at Piketty's conclusions, not because of analysis.  Giles, on the other hand, certainly seemed to have an analysis.  I thought his conclusions were pretty damning when they came out, but they have since been pretty thoroughly and humiliatingly debunked (even by the very authors he quoted).  The other main criticism is that Piketty got depreciation rates wrong, but Delong deals with that issue [here](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/06/over-at-equitable-growth-depreciation-rates-on-wealth-in-thomas-pikettys-database-monday-focus-june-9-2014.html ). 




 While I agree with you on the micro-scale, at the macro scale we're facing  an economy of increasing automation, which is obviating the need for jobs.  CPG Grey made a good video that explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU.  The only people that stand to win in such an economy are the ones who own the robots, so to speak.  We're seeing the beginnings of this transition today.  

As labor becomes unnecessary, the bargaining power of workers falls.  People aren't lazier than they were before -- they're more productive, work longer hours, have poorer health, and less free time -- but they get paid less.  The richest family in America can pay workers so little they have to rely on government assistance to get by, at the same time their company makes vast profits.  Such is the benefit of inherited wealth.

In the world we're moving into, those  who own the means of production and distribution have increasingly greater bargaining power and extract more value from labor contracts.  Workers work harder, produce goods more efficiently, and because of their efficiency put themselves out of jobs, and because of their weaker bargaining power,  share in less and less of the wealth.  

This mirrors the finding of Piketty et al., who I'm sure you've heard of if you are hanging out on Reddit frequently.  His work conclusively demonstrates that in aggregate, and increasingly so, you become wealthier simply by owning capital, whereas on average you become poorer if your income derives primarily from doing work.
 




 Once we stop giving free protection to property owners. 









 Good point. 














 It's funny.  I've asked this question several times in this thread of people criticizing Warren, and all I get is silence and downvotes.

 But what is your specific critique? 




 Good. We can stop the socialist handouts to the judicial system which enforces contracts and gives free service to property owners. 




 This seems like such feeble gesture.  Charity props up the system.  It doesn't challenge it.
 









 Yup, bad title.  Sorry.  I thought that was his last.

The media is telling the story without him having to beat up on Hillary himself.  It's much better for his story to get told this way.
 




 Good find.  Technically, this is a different show, since this is after Letterman moved to a new network. 









 The tissue box that keeps on giving when you have cat allergies. 




 I don't think it's just a matter of moving the debate to the left.  Hillary will tell people what they want to hear (like Obama did), and then govern like the carpetbagging globalist she is.  We someone who is going to represent the issues of regular people like Sanders or Warren.  Anything else is a failure. 




 What he's doing is establishing the grounds for debate: here are the important issues, this is what the American people care about.  He needs to make that message ring clear, then he can go in and dismantle her during the debates and the main campaign.

If he attacks her too soon, he's tacitly acknowledging her leadership status in the race (even though she hasn't announced), which gives her some free credibility.  And if he attacks now without establishing the grounds for debate, he'll do so from a weaker position, and will run the risk of inoculating her from those arguments later in the campaign. 



















 See my reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2fwktm/senator_elizabeth_warren_delivered_a_speech_on/ckdoy3a ). 




 Yet, SCOTUS ruled that the government also has an interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  The Constitution has conflicting goals which need to be balanced with one another.  The purpose of these amendments is to preserve a government by and of the people.   Yet, as we know from the recent Princeton study, the US is now effectively an oligarchy. 

So some balance is needed.  It won't come from the Supreme Court, which is the most corporate-friendly in history, which has overturned precedent and rejected the laws which our *elected representatives* have passed.  Their actions have made a new amendment necessary.
 









 First amendment?    

 "While money is used to finance speech, [money is not speech](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/former-justice-stevens-campaign-money-isnt-speech/ ) . Speech is only one of the activities that are financed by campaign contributions and expenditures. Those financial activities should not receive precisely the same constitutional protections as speech itself,. After all, campaign funds were used to finance the Watergate burglary, actions that clearly were not protected by the First Amendment."

 Hillary Clinton should be made to take a stand on this.   




 That code was a joke, but, having worked on several different reasoning systems, I don't see how any of them could ever be considered conscious.   

 No not at all, considering we are a few pounds of soft grey spongy material. 

But it's not clear what kind of physics is going on in there.  (And no, I don't believe in Hameroff's microtubule nonsense).  

What is clear, however, is that any of the most sophisticated AI reasoners that you could run on the fastest digital computer around today could also run on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI (Please watch) - where the physics is clear, and obviously doesn't invoke consciousness.  To say that thing is conscious just doesn't pass the giggle test.  

Have you read Chalmer's essay on the  [Hard and Easy problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html )? 




  Still, this is kind of how research works, people have experimented on animals capable of pain, even giving rats cancer to find ways of treating cancer, in the long run that benefits humanity.

But computers aren't conscious. 




 Here's an AI that's begging you to stop experimenting on it:

    def do_experiment():
        print("Please stop experimenting on me.")

     do_experiment()
    Please stop experimenting on me.


The question revolves around whether it is possible to hurt an AI and whether AIs have any subjective sensation.  I think we can agree that in the above case it doesn't.  So the real question is, when does an AI experience anything?  

The things that we call computers today are Turing equivalent.  That is, any one device could simulate any other Turing-equivalent device.  That means that [a machine like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI) could, given enough time (and tape), run any fancy AI program we dream up.  I think it strains credibility to think such a machine could ever be conscious, or that we should ever care about its suffering.  Don't you agree?

 "If only they would comply with the ethnic cleansing program." 




 So satisfying.  Thanks.  Funnily enough, I just posted yesterday about [UCLA's mechanical calculator](http://vimeo.com/70589461 ). 














 The machine's states are governed by the positions of the white flaps that are attached to a bar at the top of the machine.  Call this the "state bar".  Balls collected from the front are dropped onto the state bar.  If the bar drops onto a state flap, it rotates the bar, effectively changing the state.

Notice that the ball is picked up from one of 5 positions in front of the machine.  Each of these positions represents a Symbol; call them B1...B5.  When a ball is picked up from position ***i***, it is dropped onto the state flap in position ***i***.  Depending on the position of the state bar, the flap at position ***i*** may be in the way.  If the bar has 2 rotational positions, then the machine has 2 states, which we'll call S1 and S2. 

Thus, the rules are encoded by positioning flaps at positions 1,2,3,4,5 (corresponding to symbols B1...B5).

E.g.,

| states/positions | 1 | 2  |  3 |  4 |  5 |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
|  S1  | 0 | 1  |  0 |  1 |  0 |
|  S2  | 1 | 0  |  1 |  0 |  1 |

In this rule system, B2 and B4 cause S1-S2 transition whereas B1,B3 and B5 cause S2-S1.

This is just an example of how to write  rules.   (I'm not making any claims about whether this is Turing complete.)

 Here's an actual mechanical Turing machine (bonus points: no electricity required!).

 It looks like a continuous mechanical calculator, doesn't it? 









 There is no agency. A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:

  * electronic (the kind you're using now)
  * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )
  * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )
  
When arranged in the right way, such parts can "compute" when a motor is run.  In the case of electronic computers, the motor is an electronic clock which causes the computer to advance from one step of a computation to another.  For a mechanical computer, a real motor does the job.  

In fact, it doesn't matter what the parts are -- computers are said to be "equivalent" to each other --- i.e., any program you can describe in the most sophisticated modern electronic computer could be run (albeit slowly) on a mechanical or water-valve-based computer.  

Think of a computer as a player piano which interprets a line of the piano roll differently depending on what keys are currently pressed, and which is capable of modifying the roll (adding or deleting holes) and moving it back and forth.  The only thing that is required is an external source of energy to drive it through its paces.  As I said above, in a modern computer, an electronic clock plays this role of stepping transistors through their paces, but the principle is the same.

The mathematician Alan Turing described the first general purpose computer, and that machine was capable of doing all of the computations of any modern day computer. Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 ) in the "mechanical" link above.  Just pause and soak that in for a moment - that primitive device (given enough tape) is capable of doing any computation your fancy 2014 laptop is.

For that reason we call general purpose computers "Turing-complete".  They are all equivalent to each other in terms of the computations they can do. The only difference is that modern ones are smaller and faster, and have better input-output capabilities.  But  from a mathematical perspective, Turing's original "a-machine" was just as powerful.  In fact, the Turing machine in the video is capable of *simulating* the CPU in your laptop.  Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

Turing's machine was based on a pretty simple mechanism which had 6 states and wrote 2 symbols.  Yet, [even simpler mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine ) have been described.  So Turing completeness is pretty easy to create.  People have even created Turing-complete computers inside virtual worlds [like Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X21HQphy6I ).   Given enough memory and time, they're just as capable as the most powerful super computer available today.

So how to computers appear to think and have agency?  All the magic happens in programs. Programs cause computing machines  to move from state to state and read and write symbols as it does so.  We interpret the output as the results of the computation.  

I highly recommend Martin Davis's  excellent book on the origins of computing called ["The Universal Computer"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universal-Computer-Leibniz-Turing/dp/0393047857 ) for a great explanation of how questions about the foundations of mathematics gave rise to modern computing.
