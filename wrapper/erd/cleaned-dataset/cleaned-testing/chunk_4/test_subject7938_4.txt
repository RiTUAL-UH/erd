 Sorry everyone that the article is behind a paywall...

But hey, new garlic! 









 That's one of the most attractive answers you could give. You could also test the success of face vs. smile with a number of independent potential partners and model it with a Poisson distribution.

Though there are better ways to spend your time. 




 Wrong! It was cool. 




 I saw that Dr. Who. 




 I have my alarm set! 2:45AM and clear skies! 




 This looks like you are washing out the chlorophyll. If you boil leaves in ethanol the chlorophyll is removed but reds and yellows (anthocyanin and xanthophylls, respectively) remain. 









 I have a slightly shady site too. Peas burn out before they do much. Tomatoes just get leggy and by the time I had any last year they were cheap at the farmers' market. Kale and spinach do much better.

If you want to play it lazy, you could wait for the Farmers' Market to start up. There are transplants there the first several weeks. They are growing those plants for this climate and you could ask about lighting conditions. I usually get a few there to fill out my space.

Good luck! 




 Pick something that's not fro a plant. Even animal products are made from plants. Steel is smelted with coal made from plants. Half of pharmacedicals are plant derived inlcuding morphine, quinine, and the hormones in birth control (from a yam (not a sweet potato), FYI). Many pesticides are also derived from plants. I'm wearing trichomes (cotton) and just ate breakfast, all of which were plants.

How about [bioremediation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioremediation)?

Or [Nitrogen fixation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation) that accounts for half of the nitrogen in your body.

Or how about mythology? How many poems reference the beauty of a flower? There are people whose whole job is to grow plants, not for food, that make areas more asthetically pleasing.

Or soil erosion control, peat smoked scotch, [plastics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid), biodesil, [solvents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turpentine), perfumes, coffee, [pigments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo), and [poison.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates)

All of the above ignores wood products...

I like plants.
 




 You know, you could probably do better than chance by just knowing age. 









 It's a Dracaena. Maybe Dracaena fragrans? It looks a little low on light. Try cutting the stalk so it braches down where the light shines through the window.

Also, if the tap water is hard in your area, then it might be in need of a repotting. Hard water will build up salt deposits in the soil of house plants and choke them out. If you see white material on the soil surface, this is likely your problem. Repot and water with demineralized water (distilled, bottled drinking water) at least occasionally. 

Only do one of the above at once. 




 I mean, that's a weird pasttime, even for Austrian scientists. 




 Plants like this are why herbicides were invented. Or you learn to love it. 




 You are aware this has nothing to do with religion, right? It fits your world view, but let's be honest, this is a story about untreated mental illness. No, I don't mean religion.

Look, I think religion is as dumb as the next dude. Most religious people believe in rediculous crap and still don't do this. 




 This is my favorite news item in a while. I hear this is how the hash riots of the 1980s started. 




 You Shall Not, PASS! 



















 It's a bummer it doesn't have a chance to pass untill we get a new senate.
