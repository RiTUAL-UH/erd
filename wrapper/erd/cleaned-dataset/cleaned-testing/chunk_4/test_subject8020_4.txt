 I have a pit bull and she shimmys under our bed every night. She's 65+ lbs now and idk how its still comfortable for her  









 Tell that dumbass with the toothbrush to stay out of frame please...trying to admire the blonde milf 




 Bill Bill Bill Bill  




 Sounds like you may have a thyroid issue OP I'd see a Endocrinologist after those worms clear up  




 Does Bill Nye qualify as a scientist? 




 I'm just picturing someone using the clock whose actually deaf and it just going off for hours on end until the person wakes up normally and cuts it off ...fuck me haha 




 I am Groot  




 Your mom is cool as fuck! 




 And I'll kill them when I awake....ohh you better watch out for my Mossberg pump cuz I'm telling you why...your brains will be all overrrr the wall. :) 




 Thought post said "how do you subtly fuck someone?" 




 Al Sharpton is a straight up fucking idiot. This man lives and breathes to stir the "racism" pot. Inciting riots and violence all the while. 




 Wot m8 




 Suck my cock I'll murder your family! 




 Yeah she's still a kitten and that's the first time she's done it...had no idea and walked into the kitchen and was greeted with a friendly meow behind my back  









 My high school sold Chick-fil-a biscuits as a fundraiser...way better  




 Why can't they just give them out for free since they can't "sell" them? 




 Adam Rayyyy his old school shit is too funny  




 Nah he just forgot he was a vampire in his previous life...Fuck vampires are immortal :( 




 Fuck that's adorable  




 ...... 




 Pull yourself together Teddy. Pull yourself together. 




 Short and gripping. My fav type of nosleep stories. And I agree with others this does seem like Shutter Island..

George Noyce: You wanna uncover the truth? You gotta let her go.

Teddy Daniels: I can't.

George Noyce: You have to let her go!

Teddy Daniels: I can't! I can't!

George Noyce: Then you'll never leave this island. 




 Nah bro you're good the statute of limitations has run out..

*calls police* 




 Never been to In and Out but Five Guys is SO damn expensive. If you get a meal for two you're looking at $20-25 easy. Good burgers though and always fresh ingredients. 









 Skinny Pete getting mugging in Breaking Bad  




 God damn this shit gets reposted like every other week 









 Lol this sounds like a script from "The Following" with Kevin Bacon.  




 Chicken fried rice with baby please! 




 I have the weirdest boner 




 Maybe if they brought bold and italics to every phone it would prevent people from TYPING IN ALL CAPS TO TRY AND GET A POINT ACROSS 




 I first read this post as "My dad watching me in the shower"... lmao I was very confused initially  




 So tell me more about Vega? Are bald eagles as badass handling as they look? I've seen one from a distance because they migrated south where I live and they are fuckin huge  




 You mentioned birds make bad pets. Why is this? Because they can fly or just because they're assholes in general? 

PS fuck yeah Vega! Fuck yeah America! 




 How did he not wake up getting his wrists slit?! 




 They love the pizza a "tough" workout. 




 Is that a fucking great white?!?! Jaws himself made himself available for a photo op 




 And sometimes they will eat off an entire leg

 Some hills have eyes shit  




 Scene from the first SAW movie  




 Door to hell  




 If I dropped acid this probably would have taken me the entire night to figure out what the fucks going on  




 I think this is the only instrument they used (and needed) in both insidious movies. 




 No idea how the threat got all the way out the door. With that many cops the threat should have been eliminated immediately. Getting in a firefight in a doorway is bad news. They got the job done though and kudos for no one else being killed (hostages).  




 American Psycho  




 You should be off pudding  




 What did you call me? 









 No there's a hefty fuckin fee 




 Love you brother  




 Thanks brother 




 It is corny lmao but I'm dranking sry I'm not sry 




 Obama supporter? 




 Proud American here. 

I've followed this story since the beginning and I have felt so connected. So connected to your pain. To the newspapers pain. The families. The victims. France. 

It's a great travesty that not only France suffered but the entire world. It was no doubt an attack on free speech. 

Our Secretary of State, John Kerry, said it best: "every American stands behind you." And I truly feel that way. Feel for everyone involved.

I hope these mother fuckers are found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I hope they rot in prison for the rest of their pathetic lives.


Much love from USA 
 




 The spoiler sold me. 
























 Double Dutch rudder duh! 




 First person in history to attempt to commit suicide via Tornado  




 Co-pilot Sum Ting Wong 









 Inception  




 I'm a liability adjuster for Geico. First off, what state are you in? 




 You caught me! 




 Hence why he's on here  




 And he's just a douchebag  




 What's the story behind that video? Like why he was so pissed he kept calling him Chris  




 Yeah that's classic I remember seeing that years ago haha  









 This all comes down to the golden rule. He treated them like he would want to be treated and potentially was saved from serious injury or death. 









 Does he put mayonnaise in toasters? 




 Any birth defects in your family? 




 Umadbro 




 Now I'm hungry  




 Speaking of context I think you've taken this way out of context. It was funny because she made up a ridiculously long word trying to sound intelligent. Guess I need to specify for all you keyboard, altruistic warriors.
