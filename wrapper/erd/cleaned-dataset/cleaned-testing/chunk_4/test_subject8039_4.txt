 I'm 21, and I've rather recently discovered that I have early onset arthritis in my right knee. So I definitely know your struggle. It's not easy. I usually just use either a compression brace, or a full on DonJoy knee brace, depending on the pain level. However, there are many days I can go without one. But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you. 

Also, lots of ibuprofen. Always a big help when it comes to inflammation, or any sort of pain. Hope this helped you!! You are not alone!!  




 ......Can someone please tell me what video this is? I've actually never heard of it..... 




 That's not pathetic at all. It's never easy to lose someone you're close with, and when something like this happens, it's completely natural to want to make amends. Don't think that it's pathetic that you want to talk to your grandfather again, and tell him how you feel. 




 As far as the Miranda Rights being read is concerned, they only need to read them to you before booking you. So they have from the time they arrest you to the time they book you to read them to you. Otherwise, anything that you have said before that won't count against you. 

After you've been read them, then the only thing you should say is "I want to speak to a lawyer."  




 First off, congratulations on being clean!! My father ended up kicking meth, so it's always amazing for me to hear of others that are also doing well!! I love hearing about how others can kick those kinds of habits to better themselves!! 

Second, it sounds like your parents don't really deserve your time. (Now that is just my opinion, but I've also had to cut toxic people from my life, so I know the struggle.) It sucks to write/hear, but sometimes that's what's necessary to building a happy and healthy life.

I'm honestly curious, you said the help of NA, and I know that one. Who is the "Bill W" mentioned in this post? 




 This. This is the reason Ron would never join Voldy. He's way more afraid Mrs. Weasley than of the Dark Lord.  




 That makes total sense. Her character feels to forced. And (at least, this is how it feels to me) she is always going on about how she's a lesbian. It almost feels as though the writers just want people to know that, rather than focus on making her a hunter. That's just my two cents though. 




 I never really thought of Charlie in that sense. In fact, I never really think of any of the characters in that sense unless it's a situation like when Sam or Dean has a female guest over. Other than that, to me, they are all just people who hunt the things that go bump in the night. So I guess I'm saying that I personally have never had a problem with Charlie, however, I can definitely see where you would have a problem with her. And kudos to you for pointing this out :) 




 Everyone keeps saying Tony. For some reason, I just can't see it being him. I can, of course, see it being Fury. I, too, feel it needs to be him.  




 That's the best thing about this fandom. Everyone helps everyone else.
