 This is a joke, it's meant to make people laugh at the cheesiness... Comparing David Lee Roth to Marvin Gaye is like comparing Brian Williams to a military veteran.

 No, CO is what is used to keep the meat looking red long after it should be. 









 Thanks. My apologies to OP.

Is CO used to "preserve" the myoglobin or just prevent oxidation while meat is still on shelves? 




 Meat is [removed: made] kept artificially red by the use of Carbon Monoxide. It gives the consumer the impression of freshness when purchasing. When heating up the beef, the Carbon Monoxide is "cooked" off.

 "This is a lttle prayer dedicated to the separation of church and state. I guess if they are going to force those kids to pray in schools they might as well have a nice prayer like this: *Our Father who art in heaven, and to the republic for which it stands, thy kingdom come, one nation indivisible as in heaven, give us this day as we forgive those who so proudly we hail. Crown thy good into temptation but deliver us from the twilight's last gleaming. Amen and Awomen.*"

 I don't have anything on Muslims in other parts of the world, but this Gallup article speaks to the contrary as far as American-Muslims are concerned:

http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx

EDIT: Changed Muslim to Muslims. 



















 "Given what we know both about western media portrayals of Islam and Muslims on the one hand, and media effects and theory on the other hand, it would be foolish to dismiss western media representations as potential causal factors in anti-Muslim sentiment and crime. In fact, it is likely that anti-Muslim sentiment and crime are, at least in part, driven by one-sided, narrow, sensationalistic, and arguably bigoted western media portrayals of Islam and Muslims."

 Read Malcolm Gladwell's newest book *David and Goliath*... He makes some very interesting discoveries.

Edit: Added words in the structure of a sentence. 




 A few more things, because I have enjoyed this discussion so much:

Read this: http://www.businessinsider.com/importance-of-swiss-bank-document-leak-2015-2

...you will notice that this was "news" in 2010, oh, and pay extra special attention to the last paragraph in the **So why does this matter?** section. It states, "the French are taking 72 individuals to court over what is in the documents, and "most of the French taxpayers whose identity was revealed in the Falciani lists have since regularized their tax affairs."... That is called a slap on the wrist.

Then jump back up and link to Matt Taibbi's 2013 article (http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5r-19Ro) and read up on the "fine" issued by the USJD in 2012 and tell me how much HSBC paid.  He also states, "In other words... the banks have us by the balls, that the social cost of putting their executives in jail might end up being larger than the cost of letting them get away with, well, anything.

EDIT: Removed ZERO. 




 Ok, well, we are officially going around in circles... Just keep my username handy so you can gloat when all of these people are **publicly humiliated** for not paying their respective shares and then prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law... But I **seriously** doubt that will happen. This **HUGE** news story will just be another flash in the pan.

I mean, c'mon, did you see what Kanye did to Beck at the Grammy's?!? Media outlets air this garbage and rich people everywhere applaud. 




 Or how prestigious the school was that you attended... Just read Malcolm Gladwell's book *David and Goliath*

Edit: Changed book title.

 No offense OP, but I'll just check this post out tomorrow. 




 It seems replacing this person with a machine and then properly educating/training said person in a STEM field would be much more productive... That was some incredible focus and fine-motor skills! 




 I always heard this one in college: 

"A" students will work for "B" students in buildings built by "C" students. 




 I would just like to say that I am glad we are able to have this discussion and I appreciate your willingness (as well as mine) to remain civil through the duration. With that being said...

Yes, again, my point remains the same... 30,000 leaked documents telling us what we already know is not news, from a "Wow! Really? That is actually going on?" standpoint. 30,000 rich assholes being prosecuted because of what we already know is news. All the time, information like this is released - about how all the rich people are cheating the system, rigging the game, fixing the score, etc, etc, etc. - and nothing ever happens because of it. The richest 1% will soon own half of the world's wealth... and there is not a single thing the 99% can do about it at this point. Money has been the single source of corruption for as long as money has existed.

Take Edward Snowden for example... Does anyone really believe he STOPPED the US govt. (or any other) from spying on their citizens? Please... They probably amped it up further, faster.

I understand what you are saying to me, however, I still stand beside the reason for my initial comment. 









 Again, it will be news when someone is actually prosecuted... and serves a real sentence. 









 Yeah, I'm not even gonna try to be smooth about this one... I totally missed it. That's what I get for commenting on Reddit before I finish my first cup of coffee... *hangs head in shame* 




 No, it is not... Throw a dart at fortune 500 companies and you will have a 100% success rate at hitting one that is avoiding millions a year in taxes. It is common knowledge... Or should be, in a country built on a financial system such as the USA's.

 Does a little girl appearing to jack off Grover not make you say, "WHAT THE FUCK?!?" 




 Thank you for your comment. Once again, my intention was not to point to the girl and say, "She should not be born." My intention was to poke fun at her parents, who should not be raising children in the way they do. They have turned her childhood into a reckless circus coordinated for all of the world to see. That is insensitive. That is irresponsible. But who am I? I'm just a person on the internet engaging in a discussion on what is apparently "right" and "wrong"... One thing is for sure though, the last thing I am ever going to do, is be all sensitive about things I see on the internet. I appreciate your opinion, I feel you have a valid argument... And with that, have a nice day. I have to get back to raising my children with love and kindness and to teaching them to have a sense of humor about life and all of it's oddities... Including other people. 




 Thank you for your wonderful insight kind commenter... I actually have three young children and I raise them in a way, that I believe, is appropriate. Which means that I am not feeding my children excessive amounts of food, dressing them up like inanimate dolls, and exploiting them on television for profit. This post depicts a natural disaster, IMO, of parents like hers not needing to raise children for so many obvious reasons, they cannot all be described in this comment, or better yet, an essay. I'm glad that you have a natural right in this world to express your views of opposition.

 ...slight of ass-licking? 




 While having a bite to eat, they talked about their moonshine operation.
 
Suddenly, a woman at a nearby table who is eating a sandwich, began to cough. After a minute or so, it became apparent that she was in real distress.
 
One of the hillbillies looked at her and said, "Kin ya swallar?"  The woman shook her head no.  
  
Then he asked, "Kin ya breathe?"   The woman began to turn blue and shook her head no.
 
The hillbilly walked over to the woman, lifted up her dress, yanked down her drawers, and quickly gave her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.
 
The woman was so shocked that she had a violent spasm, and the obstruction flew out of her mouth.  As she began to breathe again, the Hillbilly walked slowly back to his table.
 
His buddy said, "Ya know, I'd heerd of that there 'Hind Lick Maneuver' but I ain't niver seed nobody do it!"
