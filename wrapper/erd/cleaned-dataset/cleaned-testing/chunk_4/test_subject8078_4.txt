 This is what I did.  Make a new Facebook photo album   set the privacy to only you.  Then upload pics there.  Then you can use those pics on Tinder.

But now you have those pics on the facebook server, and at mercy of any "random" privacy changes that might occur.  




 Southern Comfort bombed in sprite

Think a jager bomb, in how to make it.  




 you guys still gave up 41 points

Might wanna look at the play-by-play, before making a general statement like that.  

Their first TD came from a trick play. They did a Wide receiver pass to get the points. That occurred with 9:51 left in the FIRST  http://www.tarheeltimes.com/article59839.aspx

Second TD came on a 4th down   5 trick play.  Their punter threw a pass for a TD.  That was 14:47 in the Second. 

They got two more TDs in the 4th quarter.  But it was already 56-27 at the start.

So they got 14pts off of trick plays and 14pts in garbage 4Q time.  Yes they count as much as legit TDs, but the defense only gave up 13 other points.   




 Yup, on Android.  














 Hope so! Or A LOT of kids are missing around me.  




 Currently, the match list is sorted by your most recent matches/messages.  It would be good to have the option to resort by distance.  

If I go to City B for a weekend, then come back to City A, I don't want City B matches clogging up my match list.  On the flip side, when I travel back to City B, it would be nice to see who I previously matched with.   




 The new Tinder match sound reminds me of an "Emergency Alert" I receive for Amber alerts and what not.  My heart always skips a beat when that thing screeches.   




 One idea is reverted back to the previous **Notification** settings.  Now, you can either have notifications or not.

In previous versions, you could choose between an icon, sound or both.

I don't want to broadcast my Tindering to my friends, so I have to keep my phone on silent. 




 Could we have a thread on realistic improvements to the Tinder app?  I say realistic, because asking for an "undo swipe" button won't fly.  But there has to be ways to make this app better.  

Hopefully someone on their development team is subscribed to this subreddit.

 Is that in Wilmington, NC?  Were you transporting a patient, organs, or something else?  Where were you going?
