 tried to watch it, but turned it off because Nancy Grace is more dangerous than any drug ever invented.  last thing I want to do is get hooked on that shit... 




 you definitely should!  there's a small group of us and we're always looking to network further and find new DJs.  I'm trying to put together a lineup right now for another house residency here in the city.  If anyone has good venue recommendations please let me know! 




 cute, and yet horrible. 




 there's a San Francisco DJ group meetup each month at Showdown at 6th and market.  Bunch of house DJs there...come check it out

 I just meant that both the run ups on TSLA and TWTR were fueled by bullish sentiment and shorts covering their positions.  TSLA more so than TWTR.  the short float (% of float sold short) for TWTR is now just 5%, TSLA's is 48%.  Short squeezes have seemed to factor a bunch lately in these mini-stock bubbles.  It's great if you can take the plunge early and get in, but you have to be quick on the trigger for exiting.  Getting in at the peak and having no safety net in the form of stop loss orders is a recipe for a personal shame spiral.
