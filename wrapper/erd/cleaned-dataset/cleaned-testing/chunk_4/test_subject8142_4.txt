 Actually they usually say valid at McDonald's only. 




 Also an awful drinking game. 




 I was once told to reinstall the game. I wasn't sure how that would help. 




 Scrubs: A show about the men TLC rejected. 




 Don't hate on Mad Dog. It was one of the higher ranked choices for my "how drunk can I get for $5?" game. First place was far and away 2 cans of either Four Loko or Snoop Dogg Blast, the Colt .45 answer to Four Loko. A beautiful product. 




 Get the cans that just say beer. 




 Accountant? 




 Man we're talking about practice. Not a game, not a game. Practice. 




 That's why he's too busy to study for accounting. 




 My mall still has 2 Gamestops thanks to the EB Gamestop merger. 




 In all likelihood it's due to the new ACC contract where we have to play 5 teams a year from the ACC. Michigan was probably the least expensive game to cut, and most people here think it'll be added again once Purdue or MSU run out their contract. 




 The administration also refuses to build a basketball practice facility. 




 I went and finally did all the Heisman Challenges I'd never gotten around to last week. 




 Tons. 




 Make them support only. For wards, healing, stuns, etc. 




 Don't forget probably the most unbeatable NBA record. Sheed's 41 technicals in a season. Still technically possible, you just have to get one in almost every game you play. 




 One of my friends got a letter from them telling him he'd been in the top 10 in bandwidth used in the area for 3 or 4 straight months and to please stop or they'll look into what he's doing more closely or something to that effect. He was pretty proud. 




 It's really not. Having a few of each type that you can play is part of the strategy. 




 Honestly as long as you can play a few it doesn't really matter. If you can play 2 champs of each type you're pretty much set. And a pro would need a max of 5 champions that he can play, since their roles are set, and that's assuming the other team was so worried about him that they used all their bans on his champs and the person in the same role on their team also picked one that he played. 




 Honestly you're probably going to be worse off. If you've only unlocked champions you like you've probably played those ones more, meaning you're better with them. If you have too many you're not going to be good with any of them. And even if you did get more, if you're only good with a few it doesn't matter about the others.

Also if you play ARAM (All Random, All Middle) having more champions is a big disadvantage.
 




 I had a friend get yelled at for ap yi in aram once. 




 Maybe she was in the middle of king's cup and was question master. 




 A friend of mine from high school is dating a girl like this. Fortunately it's been 5 years and he hasn't noticed. 




 So would a lot of moms. 




 I had a friend who thought that you couldn't have sex during the day. That's why we had visiting hours between 9am and midnight for our dorms. What confused me most is that on weekends visiting hours didn't end until 2. Apparently she switched schools a few times in high school and managed to miss sex ed entirely. 




 I've always wanted to fight a dragon. 




 Class dismissed. 




 Yeah she's avoided it on multiple musical episodes between this and Buffy now. 




 You say no to ratchet pussy, JuicyJ can't! 




 Use Your Allusion. 




 Man Alyson Hannigan really hates singing. 




 Wow awesome, that fixed it. 




 Yeah that's when it started. 




 Oh cool, I thought that was just me. It also does this when I try to save item sets. 




 I kind of agree with you. My opinion is Buffy would have better individual episodes. I think there are a lot of Buffy episodes that are better than pretty much any Angel episode on an episode by episode basis. But Angel had way better overall storyline and plot arcs. I felt like Angel was actually building somewhere, especially since it had a consistent enemy throughout the show. Plus obviously the redemption story for everyone in the show was great. I feel like Angel just got much deeper. 




 I had a Catholic brother as the rector of my dorm in college. He had been in rehab the semester before I got there for alcoholism. He was absolutely oustanding, for the record, the entire time I was there. I imagine the loneliness is part of it. I think for him at least, a big part of it was the temptation was there all the time. It's got to be a lot harder to stay sober when you see college kids getting drunk on a tuesday. That said, it also made his talks about the dangers of alcohol and alcoholism a lot more powerful. 




 Read that as Uncle Phil and was confused. Though I'd watch Uncle Phil teach a kid to be street smart. 




 And yet Trevor Mbakwe was allowed to come back for a 6th year when he lost a year because he had legal issues. 




 We'd had problems for a while, and had always had fights over really dumb stuff. She was clingy and had a distinct lack of trust. She'd accuse me of cheating even though I was spending all my free time with her (apparently those group project I had were made up so I could go hook up with other girls). These were all exacerbated by distance when she graduated and I had a year left.

The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was a game of League of Legends. We would play together a fair amount. She was a pretty inconsistent player, though, so she'd have some pretty bad games. League's community being what it is, she'd get yelled at sometimes in game. Finally, after being told to stop feeding and eventually to uninstall, she quit in the middle of the game and within a week it was basically over. And that is how League of Legends ended my relationship. 




 Who doesn't love a nice beersicle though? 




 Harvard basically gets the racial percentages in america for each class. Exactly as diverse as the county as a whole. 




 Ours were like 50 people crammed into a dorm room with probably at least 10 cases. 




 We had a challenge in our library where you had to drink a beer on every floor. 14 floors. No using the elevator. 




 I paid less to go to an expensive private school than I would have to go to a state school. Yay for starting college right after the market tanked. 




 Just don't forget about it. 




 Heroes get remembered, but legends never die. 




 Named after "Far Quad" at Notre Dame. 




 Holy shit I'd completely forgotten about eon8. 




 Possibly in relation to the remake of the original they'll be coming out with soon, as well as the possibility of an announcement about fable 4. 




 For Love of the Game. 




 He's also incredibly self centered. Just watch his interaction with George Michael. 




 I've used organizing Humans vs. Zombies on campus as an example in a ton of interviews. 




 And if we do decide to do change the helmet, at least make it even. Let's not have another 2/3 of one color and 1/3 of the other anytime soon. 




 My guess is Michigan comes back eventually in place of MSU and/or Purdue, once those buyouts are more manageable. 




 In all honesty this may have killed any notion of us ever joining the B1G. It wasn't that likely anyway, but it was definitely going to be up for a lot of consideration if it ever became necessary to join a conference for football.  However, given the history of feelings such as this, going all the way back to Yost and his telling us we couldn't join because we were Catholic, it just seems unlikely.  




 What bothered me wasn't even the Catholic comments as much, it was the fact that he singled out Fr. Joyce. Don't speak ill of the dead, especially one of your contemporaries. It felt like a completely unnecessary potshot. 




 And this is why straddling is often a bad decision. 




 I worked there 5 years ago. Their goal is to straddle the 2. They showed us some video about how Walmart is the cheap store and Target is the trendy store. They wanted to be the smart store. 




 Yeah to me half the point of college is the experience. You don't get that going to CC or even a commuter college. 




 Community College isn't always cheaper long term. Yes, tuition is lower, but you also can miss out on a lot of scholarships the only make available to freshmen, making your long term tuition higher. 




 Tie between two people. One would be Chris Stevens. Grew up in foster homes. Ends up being good enough at basketball to get a scholarship to Notre Dame. Plays on the team that stops UCLA's 88 game win streak. After school goes to play in Europe for a year before working for Proctor and Gamble and then running a Budweiser distributor. Finally gets tired of that and helps to found Keurig. After having done that for a while he's retired now and just funds interesting projects and is now teaching at Notre Dame.

The other would be Alasdair MacIntyre.  He's one of the most highly regarded philosophers in the world and incredibly interesting to listen to. 




 I believe he's more of a Jimmy John's and Krispy Kreme fan. 




 All the accents in that were really impressive. 




 Which is almost sad considering she won a Tony. 




 On the other hand if Hitler hadn't risen to power, someone similar might have. And that person might have been more strategically sound than Hitler.

 Hailfire if you want just drop dozens of darts at once. Retaliator if you want to hit people from 60 feet away accurately. 




 The sun is out an hour longer during Daylight Saving Time. 




 But cops have to tell you if they're a cop if you ask them! 




 Salary cap is a bitch. 




 Baseball. 




 Carla was Dominican. Not being white =/= black. 




 Children might have seen that! 




 My favorite still goes to "Out. for. a. walk....bitch." 




 He needs a new accountant if he's paying 37% on 70k a year. 




 Ooie Pooie! 




 The next dorms are going up east of Knott and PE. Right on the newly minted Knott Quad. I think there might also be plans for another 2 on West Quad. 




 Hey he looked great against us. I'm pretty sure ESPN was ready to proclaim him the next combination of Montana Elway and Marino combined. 




 (`) 




 People actually have this issue? Now if the questions could somehow decrease time, that'd be helpful. 









 Nate Montana is probably the worst quarterback I've ever had the misfortune of watching. This includes high school games. He came in against Michigan a few years ago and wasn't throwing picks like Tommy Rees was because he didn't have enough accuracy or arm strength to get it near anyone. Absolutely awful. 




 Golic was easily the weakest part of our O-Line this year. And the year before he filled in for Cave at center when he got hurt. He must have been telegraphing terribly because suddenly every D-Line we played jumped right at the snap. I'd be shocked if he's on the roster when games start. 




 I very much doubt it happens, but Troy Niklas is a guy who at least has first round potential. It'd take a pretty big year, but the dude is a beast. 




 And become some combination of bigger and faster. 




 Whoosh 




 They're just happy anyone's going to the game instead of tailgating through it. 




 Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders. 




 In fairness, who wants to be the guy that tackles one of your best defensive players and accidentally takes him out for the year? 




 Boom/Mordor/Smack a Hoe

Everyone stands around a table. There's a bunch of cups with about as much beer as you'd used for pong or flip cup, and one that's all the way full for the last person. 2 people are playing at once. It usually starts with people on opposite sides of the table. The goal is to bounce a ping pong ball into your cup. If you do that, you pass to your left. If you make it on your first try, you can pass it anywhere. If the person to your right manages to make one before you do, they slap your cup of the way, pass their cup to the person on your left, and you have to drink a new one. It goes until the last cup gets finished, and that person is the loser. 




 I almost drunkenly bought this last week. 




 And then those lucky one or two people get thunderfucked and have to drink through an entire verse. 




 A kid I went to high school with's sister did Girls Gone Wild. She apparently made it into the commercial for that one, too. So he, his sister, and his parents are watching something like Comedy Central late at night and the commercial comes on. He sees his sister, looks over at his family, and walks out and goes to bed. He never asked about anything after that. 




 It's a one hot album every 10 year average. 




 That's where they're from. 




 Yeah I understood the point which was they did better in low scoring games, but it came across that way. 




 I loved during the NCAA tournament one year they were talking about how Wisconsin did really well when they held their opponents under 50 or some really low number. It just seemed so monotonous and obvious that they did well when they held the other team to a low number of points.  




 It's like Pavlov. 




 I also bought a ds with mario kart. 




 Hey I won the fall 2005 one!
