 Lots of fun things coming out soon.  
Lots of money I don't have.   




 I blasted a ten hour compilation of arab rap music until they shut up. Now I'm just listening to some podcasts and chilling 




 It really made me think differently about dreaming and how the mind works. I stayed in bed for like, a half an hour and thought about it. 




 Or a large gaming channel and going into airsoft with no knowledge of airsoft 




 Lol "hey guys I sucked Bob from ASGI's dick for this free gun please buy it" 




 Little sister is having a sleep over in the room next to me and being too loud so I'm blasting [this] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yLDUmyx3XXU) through speakers. Shit's hilarious since my room is foggy due to the vaperino.

Edit: Now I'm using arab rap music 




 This is my most vivid lucid dream I've ever had, and it's a bit long but I hope you stick along for the ride. I usually induce lucid dreaming by meditating before I sleep or sleeping with my arms at my sides repeating mantras and shit. This was by far my most successful lucid dream ever. Usually I just fall into sleep paralysis, which I'm also cool with, but this was way different. The dream felt like it spanned a year, but there were random patches in it and time skipped a lot. Well here goes.

I woke up in a cabin of sorts, like a mini hotel room. When I looked out of the window I saw stars. A lot of stars. I got up and walked over to the mirror. What I saw was a older version of myself. It looked like me, but aged ten years (right now I'm 17). 

Then, I heard a knocking on the door. I was startled to say the least. A raspy voice addressed me with "Mr." and my last name, very formally. When I opened the door I was greeted by one oft he cantina aliens from Star Wars (the cute ones that play the catchy song). He told me the train would arrive in the seventh dimension in three days after making a few stops. He said that I would have a business conference to attend. It was then I realized I was dressed fairly corporate casually with a dress shirt and khakis. I was really confused but I obliged and said okay.

When he left I exited the cabin and went down the hall until I found another door. When I opened it I was greeted by a large congregation area. There were a bunch of people talking, more cantina aliens, and other confusing aliens. Shuffling through the crowd I bumped into somebody. After apologizing profusely I realized it was a girl I knocked down. She smiled and said it was okay. She was absolutely beautiful and I was awe struck in all honesty. She had black hair and eyes like mine, almost hazel but brownish. She was dressed in casual clothes and had a sun hat on. I noticed a large camera in her hands.

I asked if she was alright and instead of answering the question she said, "No, I'm Alice, what's your name?" I told her my name and she said we should have coffee later. 

I don't remember having coffee, but I remember sitting on one of the benches in the area we were before. She told me she was taking a college art course and that her assignment was to take pictures of other dimensions. It was the I looked at the surroundings that were around the train. 

White. It was **vibrant** white, and there were trees of all different colors all around us. Blue, red, yellow. Every color of the rainbow. I remember this so clearly in my mind still. It was so fucking beautiful. She stood up and started taking pictures. Then, she smiled and asked me if I thought it was beautiful.

I was awe struck and said of course. She then asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was on my way to a business meeting in the seventh dimension. She frowned, and said that was boring. Then, she asked if I wanted to tag along with her. I remember thinking, "Screw it, it's my dream." and said yes.

Things got hazy after that, and I remember going to Mars, where it looked similar to Cowboy Bebop Mars. Then I only remember going to a strange cave dimension, because when we were there she got a call about something. Her cheery expression turned to a worried expression and she quickly hung up after agreeing with whoever was on the phone. 

After that, she said she had to go and said sorry. I asked her why and what was wrong. She told me that she was sorry and didn't get back on the train. I was very sad and confused after that, afterall I was in love. Or at least it felt like I was, and that was scary for me. 

Things got hazy again and I remember it was like a few years passed. I was at my grandpa's farm again, where I lived before my current house, but there were more futuristic cars. I was running an estate sale (when people go through a dead person's house and buy stuff) for the family. 

Then I saw her again. She walked up to the deck, wearing the same sun hat as before. I walked outside and walked up to her. She almost jumped and hugged me. I asked her how she was doing and if she wanted to catch up. She obliged and the next day we met up at my house. Or at least where my house is now, but it was an apartment complex. 

When she showed up I asked her how her art was doing and her expression faded. Then she told me something about how she had to be a prostitute for money and that all of those years ago she got a call about prostitute stuff. I don't remember the details but I remember asking her if she wanted to run away or stay with me. She looked up at me and smiled, but started to tear up a bit. 

She said she had to go and couldn't be with me. This was crushing and I felt terrible. I asked if she wanted to spend the night for one last night. 

After that all I remember was holding her in a dark apartment before waking up to my alarm, crying. It was so scary to me. I've never had a dream so real. It was the most real dream I've ever had. 




 Watched everything that's out so far. Needless to say, I need to watch shows and not not watch them if they have a weird title. It's like SAO but with less plot armor and more in depth shit. I mean there's still harem bullshit, but whatever.  




 Oh yeah I got 100 GB free now 




 There was at least 26~ GB of really obscure and really really hardcore BDSM stuff 




 So my current computer used to be my grandpa's, and to free up some hard drive space I decided to delete his user. Well I decided to dig through his old user and found some weird porn. Next time I see him it's gonna be hard to look him in the eyes.  




 I personally think this gun is fucking adorable 




 Your beard is very woodsman-y 




 You need a kit list of some sort 




 Weird lol 




 Yeah I typed it but it didn't show up lol 




  \_()_/ 




 Oh I know I'm not getting anything out of it. If you think taking that argument really does anything, it doesn't.  




 Haha wow I'm cameron and I can't make a come back comment that makes sense or has proper capitlization or punctuation. 




 Oh yeah I prefer tactical pants more than BDU's 




 Ha ha wow I'm Cameron, I'm gonna add random compliments on every post I see for upvotes and not provide any help to anybody. 




 Those pants look like the ones you get at Kohls or Walmart that imitate real camo but aren't true BDU's.  




 Revision Wolfspider deluxe goggles. Never fog.  




 Holy fuck dude I read that comment and laughed out loud in class. I didn't even realize it was you lol 




 It's been done, and people would probably be more interested if you were more professional with this post 




 All of your problems, that is 




 Nobody cares about your problems cameron 




 You'd do this to everybody because nobody likes you  




 CRAAAAAWWWWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN 




 I run off two pots of coffee and a bowl of ramen a day baby 




 I don't eat lunch lol 




 Nah I told them. They just said, "Nah whatever inside mang" 




 They thought I did it for the joy of killing them. I just wanted to see if there was something in the nest. 




 Yeah, that's the funny part 




 I knocked down a bird nest full of eggs.

 On the Cowboy Bebop Wiki it does explain that Spike's fighting style was supposed to emulate Bruce Lee's exact fighting style. What is it, Jeet Kune Do, something like that. So it looks a lot like a Bruce Lee fight scene, but it doesn't copy one in any way. 




 This is a question that can be answered on /r/airsoft. We are just a subsidiary chat sub. 




 Oh yeah, that's even funnier 




 Whoa look out guys cameron is so cool and edgy and goes on 4chan. Pay attention to him. 




 Lol this happened to your MP9 right? 




 That would be awesome. I'm considering one, but there are barely any decent reviews of it.  




 Now I'm sad 




 Well I guess you'd be the right guy to ask, how do TM PSG-1's preform stock? 




 Did you, uh, misspell a_irsoft there champ? 




 Lol 




 Is that wrapping paper tied to your barrel?  
Also you need a description.  




 Jui jitsu, karate, blah blah blah 




 Needs a description 




 Or fencing or kendo. Combat. 




 Ew 




 Airsoft is combat. Just because people don't die, doesn't mean it's not combat.  




 Yeah, just look above at the other guy arguing that and being wrong 




 Close enough 




 I have an unorthodox handguard lol 




 Bodgeups is Buzzfeed. Breaking news. 




 Technically it's still combat though  




 I just thought the title was more obvious 




 I mean, prolly 




 Ew hunter camo 




 *did the amputee 




 It's really cool that retailers are leaning towards making more unique guns, and people are making unique loadouts 




 Lol this is around when Joan Rivers died  




 It's probably my favorite gun in Battlefield 4 and having an airsoft counterpart in my collection would be really neat.  




 Oh that's nice. Now you just have to get the ASG CZ 805 right? 




 Yeah at this point I was just stretching it out and thinking "Fuck it man at least I was kind of right" lol 




 Yeah they're really cool and I've been really really tempted to get one lately. 




 Ah there it is. Watched that video awhile back when I was considering the EL AK-74. That was a good video.  




 What? 




 Nah isn't ringing a bell. Weird. 




 Do you have an airsoft channel on YouTube? I've seen your face before somewhere and I can't put my finger on ot 




 Whoa, this is pretty awesome 




 Fuck I knew that, I'm out of it and in school lol. I do have to disagree on the naming thing though. Not really codsoftery at all 




 Well I never realized it was Mk18 like how the SCAR-L is the Mk.17 




 I sound out the acronym like "em-kay-18" yeah. If you say it as "Mark" then it would make sense, but I'd assume a lot of people say it like that lol 




 \Decorative pullback thing  
[\mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/QwWVIf9.gif) 




 He's dissolved into full creepy furry and gave up on airsoft for awhile I think 




 It's in the description lol 




 I'm more bugged about how he said "A MK18" instead of "An MK18."  
In this instance "M" isn't a vowel of course, but is sounded out like a vowel so that needs to be "An" instead of "A." 

Reading the title in my head hurt a bit  




 I'm probably not even going to get this or consider it, but this is still really awesome 




 PMC's don't wear camo. This is more like random gear put on and trying to do a PMC loadout.  




 I have XM8. I love XM8. I'm not Jarek. 




 B-29 best girl 




 *Oh you* 




 k bb 




 :( 




 How's the PSG? 




 Yui best blart 




 Makes sense, he's a fire demon 














 What are periods? 




 Ew, was that "xD" genuine? 




 Yeah, it'd be one thing if he had a valid argument, or at least knew how to express it. He's just stupid. 




 Did the thought *penetrate* your mind? 




 I'm all about cyberpunk and cool future stuff, but you're acting autistic 




 Jew 




 And also Utauyo Miracle by Houkago Tea Time lol 




 lol 




 It's really called Another? wat? 




 Sauce? 




 Sometimes I take the tobacco out of cigarettes and fill it with whatever I want to smoke 




 The animation quality is cool and stuff, but I remember watching it before I knew what hentai was and going, "Wait where the fuck is this going?" 




 Oh fuck this music video man 




 Alright. Cool cool.  




 I understand everything you're saying and agree for the most part. I think it's just fucked up to blow it in kids faces or around kids. Also it's douchey 




 Exactly what I said. I don't know how to go much simpler  




 People don't know the effects of it or what's in it exactly either, so why risk anything? 




 I'm pretty sure plenty of studies have been done about the negative effects of secondhand smoke. Also most of those studies are true. 




 Nice. I've heard great things about the WE  




 WE or the crappy AIM one? 




 ye 




 Nothing major besides my charging handle doesn't go all the way back because it's broken a little 




 If's a good feeling rifle 




 Don't really know how to explain, but it shoots far enough for me to play effectively 




 Meh, getting a G36k next 




 It's bretty good 




 TSD is the same as SRC 




 Top to bottom,  
JG G3  
SRC XM8  
Galaxy MP5k  














 I did, but now I don't lol 




 D A N K  B U I L D S 




 I run into so many things with my car. I'm surprised I haven't wrecked it.  




 Wait, what's Imgur? 




 Yeah same here. I check all major airsoft retailers so much that I know exactly when they add new products, check /r/airsoft every fifteen minutes, and window shop like a mad man. 




 Only fields closest to me is a sketchy CQB place an hour up north and an outdoor field an hour and a half away in Illinois, so I'm also at a loss there 




 No, I've been really interested with cyberpunk stuff lately and watched all of Psycho Pass this weekend. I'm finishing Shingatsu wa Kimi no Uso this week 




 After checking out a post on /r/airsoft, something about what you do when you aren't chairsofting or airsofting I realized I do nothing but browse dank memes and watch anime. 

Well. Shit.  




 Watch anime. Browse dank memes. Get high.  
Edit: I accept these downvotes with open arms 




 Oh oops I forgot, this is /r/creepyhallsandcrawlspaces  




 Here's the whole album, http://imgur.com/a/exlH6 




 The original poster on the airsoft sub said something about owning or it's converted into an airsoft field 




 I mean, if there's a subreddit there's a way? 




 *Nice.*

I hate the uber tactical too many rails "A3" receiver, but on [my AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/KRMijZ7.jpg) I just have the flat top rail.  




 Little late here and I was just browsing some old posts, but there's nothing wrong with the outer barrel. The handguard was wobbly and loose and I wanted to ditch it. 

[The outer barrel is completely intact underneath the shemagh actually.] (http://i.imgur.com/bBm7WBx.jpg) 




 Haha good idea. Have you considered picking up a railed receiver and just putting the marui barrel in it?  




 I'm really digging the AUG. The way you have it set up is pretty great.  




 Without his stickies it would be the same. I wasn't saying without his posts it would be the same, because it definitely wouldn't be.
