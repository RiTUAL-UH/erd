 OMG EPIC  




 any steven seagal movie  




 I used to love those  




 o good choices you went old school  




 what did u end up watching???  




 Yes he definitely should have found out.  




 Yeah the one thing I like to think that Abel will one day seek out the Club and try to join them just like his father did.  




 Ive always thought she was an angel.  




 This  




 Jack Nicholson wish he had done The Judge.  




 He is still in movies but I agree he needs a major comeback something that makes him an ALister again.  




 Yeah shes the grim reaper or something.  




 Yes I would love to know what happens to the club afterwords, what kind of leader chibs will be.  




 RIP Jax  




 Yes it was cool!!!!  




 HAHAH I LOVE Honest Trailers!!!!!!  




 cool  




 Edward Norton he is a good actor and I love his movies but he is just a big control freak it seems.  




 LOL Yeah I rewmember laughing so hard when I first saw that.  




 Nice  




 Woody Allen  




 Thats what im thinking.  




 Saw, Fight Club, Usual Suspects, and of course Oldboy 2003  




 Yes finally this is going to happen!!!!!  




 Its because he loves it so much as it is the only connection he has to earth and his mom.  




 What in the flying fuck!!!!!!  




 God I have seen it so much it is scarred into my brain.  




 Yeah thats what I hate they both went out the way they wanted to they didnt suffer well juice did I guess but thats it. Jax should have killed Gemma the same way she killed Tara.  




 Yeah true and they were all killed by/because of Jax it is so fitting.  




 That would be awesome!!!!!!  




 Now that is a cast!!!!!!  




 Only the ones I see in theaters yes, it is a word document I use a different one every year.  




 Die Hard no other  




 good also I have heard that a movie called martyrs directed by paca laugher is pretty scary too I havent seen it yet but I want to.  




 The first VHS was pretty good you can try the second one too but dont bother with the crappy third one.  




 Duncan Jones would have been cool.  




 Man I wish I can rease all knowledge of Star Wars and rewatch them in release order just so I can be shocked at that part.  




 The Lovely Bones I have only seen it 6 times because I like to preserve the feeling I get when watching it.  




 ^^^^^^THIS  




 Looks pretty funny.  




 His last few movies have been crap but I sure hope Exodus and The Martian bring him back.  




 It looks pretty good I wish I had a time machine so I can watch it now!!!!!  




 wow you seem just like me  




 Cuba Gooding Jr by Far  




 O okay yeah I keep my ticket stubs too I have been 62 times this year.  




 To me that is the only one.  




 What is today Steve Zissou day??  




 yeah true I am a student too and I know how that feels but lots of times I will go to the movies anyways even if I will burn all of my money.  




 WOW u keep track to awesome!!!! Whats the most u have had in one month???  




 Every god dam day!!!! But Hellboy 3 will likely never happen.  




 wow I didnt know intermissions still happened. Also is your name Jack Sparrow LOL  




 U r my hero  




 Hes still alive?? cool Wish he would direct again.  




 How often does everyone go to the movies?? And whats your opinion on them. For me I try to go every weekend sometimes once a week if I am lucky cause for me seeing a movie in the theater is the best experience ever.  




 Why have I never thought of that before. Good one  




 OMG YES!!!!!  




 your a cop arent u 




 HMM i will look into that thank u.  




 well its true  




 because every time i have ever talked to one including last night they were all jerks to me. I asked one for directions once and he said "im not a map" and walked away from me.  




 They have computers there??  




 UGH my bike got stolen last night I am so pissed!!!!! I wish I could find the person who did that and give them a piece of my mind if ya know wat I mean. Stupid city. Also another thing I hate cops they r all assholes.  




 LOL  




 That is cool!!!!!!!!!  




 just do a google search and find a site that has them.  




 I loved that part!!!!! Shes a good singer.  




 I would have made it one 3 hour movie and little if any lotr connections, noone but the characters that were in the book. I would probably keep ian holm as bilbo but only bookend and narrarate it.  




 here here. 




 Hangover sequels and son of mask, also ace ventura jr and big mommas sequels.  




 I listened to that for 3 days straight LOL its not that much of a challenge.  




 God I hate that just release the trailer dont make us count down to it.  




 She will never do a comic book movie, she has had many chances to in the past.  




 Yes!!!!!!!!! and yes!!!!!!!!  




 no  




 Jessica Chastain I dont like her because I think she is overrated and her face is ugly.  




 I liked it too slow at some parts but still good. I liked that jump scare at the end.  




 I like the middle part of the theater it gives u the best spot so u dont have to crane your neck. Occasionally I will sit at the bottom for the leg room.  




 It used to be cool when it first started but now its just repetitive I guess.  




 Yes  




 thanks!!!!!  




 She wont be missed or maybe.  




 I asked he does.  




 ALright yeah I just decided if I just get a new screen then thats just 200 right there which I can fund with one paycheck then send it to my friend who fixes computers for a living im sure he can help with that.  




 My bad it is a macbook 2010 model and the repair would cost 400 altogether I am not rich at all. I could get a new windows for less than that. I just dont know which way to go.  




 So my Macbook broke the other day well it didnt break break just the display doesnt work anymore and so I am forced with a decision I could fix the mac and keep using it or I could just buy a new one a windows laptop. I do not want to lose the mac forever but at the same time the concept of having a new one is intriguing. What should I do???  




 Okay yeah im gonna try that as soon as i get home tonight  




 Okay hmm I wonder if i plug it into a tv through HDMI it will still show up and I can work on it like that.  




 It wasnt on the keyboard thank god it was on the back at the bottom and where the thing folds that black part in the back.  




 Okay so I was at school today and my water bottle accidently seeped onto my mac a little bit then when I started using it the screen started flickering and then the display turned off now it wont turn back on and the computer is still black. I made an appointment at the genius bar but first I need some opinions and help.  




 Shes still alive???
 




 Josh Brolin in GOTG  




 WOW cool I had no idea.  




 I like to think that he didnt exist until IB.  




 God I hate when they announce the trailer dates for movies just freakin release it.  




 Hello Natalie I am a big fan of yours I was wondering, what is your favorite role you have played like ever???  




 Awesome movie saw it awhile ago.  




 Doesnt look that good  




 I just noticed that every phone number has them now, why do we do that?? And when did it start???  




 Man my old roomates gf is obsessed with movies like this, caused a lot of heartbreak because she only liked "happy" movies.  




 Thats what I like about her tho.  




 Looks cool  




 Hes such a joke.  




 Theres another IMAX movie coming in a few weeks I believe. The Hobbit The Battle of Five Armies
