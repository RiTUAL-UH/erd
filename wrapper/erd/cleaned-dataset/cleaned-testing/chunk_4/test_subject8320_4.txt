 All I see it two pepole bumping uglys, I don't see how this has anything to do with Liam  




 Just not an engraved one, their useless out here in the jungle, they provide no camouflage! Fuck dude I need to beat MGS3 (I'm stuck on volgin) 




 I love the bioshock idea It would be awesome to see a sprite of one of the ziabatzu in red and white sailor stripes 




 Nope! Just read the description of you want to know more :)  




 Hey dude I feel you, but it's already kind of spoiled because if you look at the thumb nail for future episodes you can see him in the thumbnails  




 [only the best](http://the-switcher.deviantart.com/art/Still-in-a-dream-Snake-Eater-37133975) 




 Matt I know you've been busy lately but if you ever find some time post more drawings!!! I love your stuff man 









 Hmmm /u/nin_ninja is onto something. How about instead for Liam it should be something vocaloid related like the twins heads as slippers or something 

EDIT!!!: their names are Len   Rin 




 Oh man, oh jeez, oh fuck, oh shit.... [The face when Matt comments on my thread](http://www.listal.com/viewimage/1403774h) 




 Holy shit that dager launcher tho 




 Hmmm so I'm not the only one 




 Dude.... Next time put a side warning!! My sides feel like that chick from saw 3, seriously though good find, also to the creator of the video having life is good play over the whole thing was just...... Perfect  




 If only guy could do a cameo

EDIT: the ziabatzu should go the the lake side hotel at some point and pat should get stuck between the hotel beds  




 Phew that got graphic... *cough* *cough* *cough* I think I need to go take a shower 




 I still need to buy those albums when I have 30 dollars  




 It's because he spits acid and is FUCKING INVISIBLE! Reptile is the ultimate waifu  




 ^^^^^yes 




 Pat was too gud  




 Mine was the duke nukem video, here's my thought process from that day. "Dum de dum I'm just going to watch some more videos on video games.... Wait duke nukem forever came out?! Oh man I got to watch that video! hmmm the two best friends? Never heard of them (After video) man that game looked bad, 15 years of hype all for that good thing I've never played duke 3D also those guys were hilarious I'm going to see if they have any more videos  




 You: Pssst.... joe, Joe, JOE!! Joe: "What!" You: Say it... Joe: "Sigh... [Good Grief]" 




 digging the art style! Very TF2 









 That mothefucker...... 




 Noob question! Why is September first such an important date? 




 The part where jack puts on the hat is so platinum  




 I'll do that! Thanks :) 




 I know that is says "jumped" in the title but I'm suspicious because a quick Google search of "jumped, jumped jumpstyle and jumped artist" reveals nothing nothing :(, also I know this is a jumpstyle/tekstyle track but this is the most active hard dance sub I know of 









 Matt oh suck it.wav 




 Every time you move them you should get a John cena quote. (Inserts rubber fist) "you can't see me!" 









 Neo Kanada sounds like the hypest shit!! I wounder if they have glowing neon blue maple syrup? 




 I'll come as the punisher, I'll hold their arms if you punch them in the stomach  




 I was stroking my nostalgia boner the other day remembering all the dumb/awesome ones, so tell me what's your favorite? 









 I understand, Speedcore isn't for everyone :P 




 My sides feel as if the boss practied her CQC on them 




 mystery box 1 ! Matt said something about how french animation is really bad 




 now I know what your probably thinking "this sounds like shit and its really quiet" well your right but don't worry I WILL finish and master this properly (with the help of friends if necessary) I really want to make it...... Perfect    




 but will it be released? that is the question (I hope it dose I liked mirrors edge) 




 I think he did actually, way back during the hideous remix compition if you messaged BOS with a proof of purchase they would send you a sample pack 




 Nope, it's a subground kick ;) check out QULT if you want to hear more music like this  




 Mabey try a diffrent genre in the same vein like subground or hands up 









 The torrent for Caligo isn't working for me :/ is anyone else having problems? 




 Oh god damn it Liam got into kill la kill 




 RULES OF NATURE!!!! 




 I think I see what he means 




 Kind of a odd question to ask here, but I know that a lot of Hardstyle producers use it 




 Gabber - [Ophidian - Butterfly (VIP)](http://youtu.be/KddV9Hq9P8Q) 




 Gabber 4 life! 




 Is their any place I can still get camelphat? Or is it gone for good :( 




 That's awesome! I found a [video](http://thecrystalmethod.com/slam-academy/) of the crystal method event for anyone interested  




 What do you play now? 




 Have you ever met one of you favorite artists at a festival or in public? I haven't but man do I have a story for you. I went on a trip to Austria last summer (very nice place by the way) once I landed and left my gate I had some time to kill so I decided to look at the people coming through the gate. I notice a guy wearing a destroid hat but I don't think much about it, 5 minuets later I realize that guy was Excision (I kicked my self a bit but I got over it) later I'm browsing Facebook and I see a post that ken from the crystal method is coming to the twin cities to talk about production at a FREE class. Needles to say I was upset 




 What's the opinion of hard dance on this sub? I'm having a hard time gauging it 









 FL user! I love all kinds of hard dance (hard trance, Frenchcore, hardcore, hardstyle .ect) so HMU if your interested and I'll give you my Skype, the best way to contact me is through PM because I never use Skype unless I know someone's going to call, so PM me on here before you message/call me on skype I'm still new to the production world but I know afew things, also I do have harmor if that matters 

SC: https://m.soundcloud.com/infernal-imp 




 thats pretty much all their is too it :) 




 My man!!! All right this should be easier to explain. Let's say you have your melody, pads and bass routed to channels 1, 2   3 respectively. You'll find a send knob/button at the bottom of each mixer channel, click on it and then click on the send of the channel you want to route too let's say 4 in this case (it should say for example route 1 to 4 in the top left corner if your doing it right) after you've routed all your channels you now have what is called a bus, you can now EQ, distort, compress and side chain everything that is routed to mixer 4 just automate the channel volume slider and bam their you have it :) all of your melodic elements are now side chained! The best part is that if you need to change something you only need to change the one automation. Busses are also great for blending percusive elements like kicks and snares, hope this helps! 




 Yes, also what daw are you using (depending on which one you are using I might have to explain it a little differently) 




 I actually do have afew connections, I have a friend who has done remixes for and knows the crystal method. I have a friend who MIGHT know Eric prydz and also has a friend at rotten. (He has afew more connections but I forget who/what they are). As for artists, I'm a massive fan of hard dance so pepole like angerfist, ophidian, da tweekaz, DJ thera. Etc. P.S. Thanks :) 









 Sure thing :), I have been producing for about a year so I am still a beginner but I have been playing bass since 4th grade (I'm a high school junior now). I use FL studio because I love the piano roll and interface. As for the mentor someone who can teach me synth programming or give me ideas like "this noise would sound good for the fill" also someone to bounce ideas off of. As for the remix it is "voices in my head (redo)" by round wave crusher 




 As the title says I'm looking for a mentor. Someone who knows a good deal about electronic music, currently I am doing a remix for one of my favorite artists and I really want it to be special. Left to my own devises I don't think it will turn out very well. Let me know if you're interested :) 




 I'll get it from him today :) 




 [Heres a link to mine](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/j-core-set-for-tallent-show) 









 thanks for the patch bassed harmor bass god of bass........... bass 




 Thanks but this isn't exactly what I'm looking for :/ im trying to make a kick like [this](http://youtu.be/xThLTxVVfhw) start at 1:03 




 Can someone explain the process/show me any good tutorials? I'm really interested in making hard trance  




 If you do get fl splurge a little bit and get harmor 




 this ezo shall pierce the heavens  




 I read that as woolie the pie stealing moe at first..... 









 I like the way this guy thinks 




 someone spilt their vocaloid in my Jojo and I'm ok with that 




 Post your stupid crossovers and/or ideas here! Mine is "what if the crucible had stands?" Seriously think about how cool that would be "goody nurse did you send out your stand in the middle of the night to terrorize these girls? I did no such thing your honor, my stand only heals and calms. We shall see about that! Adoadoadoadoadoaodaodadoado!!!!!"  




 You can get some really good sounds with this thing and the best part is that it's 100% free! They have more emulators but sadly they are reason exclusive :/ 














 Utopia  




 Did you see hear the track he released a little while back? 




 http://touhourecords.blogspot.com/?m=1 For what you can't find on doujinstyle look here 









 I think hard trance would also fit well 




 Surprisingly well actually  




 Last Friday me and my friend did DJ sets for our school talent show 

[Here's my friends set](https://soundcloud.com/noah-zins/d-days-live-set) it's a deep/electro house set

[Here's my set](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/j-core-set-for-tallent-show) it's a j-core/hard dance set 




 What!?! He didn't shave down the grip! 




 Man we need some gabber artists on monstercat  














 Ahhhh!!! This album is so good I'm so happy that 1/2 of 16bit is still making music!!! 




 Mainly dancing and singing acts (some better then others) 




 People went crazy! Especially during bad apple   clock control 




 Ya Shingo really loves touhou, he did the same thing in his [remix of native faith](http://youtu.be/8giKbzcxA-E) 




 Ya dude! I was hyped when I got the greenlight 




 thanks, I had to do pretty lazy transitions because it had to be under 10 minuets :) 




 it's a DJ mix, the whole thing was suppose to show my talent as DJ :) 




 I don't really have a say in it because none of the music is mine but I'm fine with it  




 well I say talent show... really it was an all school thing that you didn't even have to audition for (their were some pretty bad acts). also for anyone willing to make an OSU! map, knock yourself out 









 Ya man the gabberbox covers have that classic 90's horror feel to them plus their really good old school compilations! 




 I know this really isn't the place to be asking this kind of question but I could really use some help. I've been interested In making old school hardcore and the one thing that is troubling me is the kick, I just cant get that old school sound, Distorting is no problem its just getting the old school character. Any help is appreciated :)

[How I want it to sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EypIMWFGnWU feature=youtu.be)

[What I get (Synthesized 909)](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/old-school-kick-demo-synth) 

EDIT: [Found this video](http://youtu.be/FrFLz7LVGp0)
    




 I've been doing that and I'm still not getting the sound [I want](http://youtu.be/EypIMWFGnWU) 




 I'm having a hard time getting the right sound can someone help me/know of any tutorials? 




 As long as it's in key with the music and not to high pitched then I can [dig it.](http://youtu.be/qn9AeUK-jG4) [Nightcore](http://youtu.be/JThz8-nYYHs) on the other hand.... 









 Also check out the organ donors FB they released a zip file with all their 2014 tracks for free 




 Not all hard trance is like this but most of the stuff I listen to is, some recommendations I have are Lisa lashes, Kidd Kaos, Alex Kidd, dark by design, ASYS, geck-o and the organ donors. P.S. Listen to [this](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) it's what got me into hard trance :) 









 The lead is amazing c: 




 We finally get another Excision   Space laces collab!  




 You dose it again! 









 Ohhhhhhh!!! *airhorns* *memes* *euphoria* 




 You have broken into your favorite artists studio, you find their computer and begin transferring files to your hard drive when you hear a commotion afew rooms away. They must have heard you! In the small amount of time you have you figure that you can only take one patch, what patch do you take? Personally I would take the screech patch from firestorm by digital punk (soo raw!) p.s. I do not condone the breaking into/theft of any producers homes and or studios :) 




 fuckin Kevin man... 




 nooooooo...... at least let me take off my pants!!! 




 [...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYT66ALUUss) 









 Us shitlords over at /r/twobestfriendsplay are also sending out our love, while the ziabatzu didn't talk about him a lot (they mentioned him a few times on the podcast) a lot of fans (including myself) found out about Monty's hospitalization and death through the TBFP sub and we are all saddened your guys loss. EDIT: Currently 22 other subs have posted the article from the RT site!  




 I never picked up on that part (the being useless part that is) 




 Okuu + Schranz = 3 









 His whole "GnB" Album is fantastic! Download it for free NAO! 









 If you see Swiper say: MY STAND WILL BE THE JUDGE!!! P.S. the guy who made this was inspired by [this](http://avielsusej.deviantart.com/art/Dora-la-Bizarra-ExploraDORARARARARARARA-368100133) comic and yes steal my comment from deviant art

 Im talking Jojo, space jam and everything else that is stupid and awesome! 




 Le omg what is this crap XDdDXD, I'm 12 and I love the classics like queen, the stones .ect le sigh if only I was born in another generation 









 Some of you might be thinking "haven't I heard this before?" Well you might have because he sampled the song "on nature of daylight" from shutter island. Checkout more of goreshit's stuff he gives it all out for free!  









 This is goreshit's YouTube channel (if you really need me to re-submit this I will) P.S. I'm not trying to start a fight with you I promise, I love all the mods on this sub and the last thing I would want to do is make one of you guys angry 




 Some of you might be saying, "haven't I heard this somewhere before?" You probably have because he sampled the song "on the nature of daylight" from shutter island. Be sure to check out more of goreshits stuff, he gives it all out for free! 




 lets say I rout track 1 to track 2. is it possible to Un-rout them or am I committed after that point?   




 You to dude 




 It's cool :) Frenchcore is a kind of hardcore, the main difference is the kick [heres a good example of one](http://youtu.be/j7UVCxcW46Y) 




 thanks man! This is a little off topic but do you know of any good 909 sample packs? (Free or paid it doesn't matter :) ) 




 Try out some different daws, get afew sample packs (free or paid) and most importantly HAVE FUN (if your not having fun then theirs no point) 









 It's cool that you don't know genres :) from the sound of this I'd say that it's some kind of house 









 trying it out now
EDIT: a lot better
 




 Bleave it or not view distance was the only thing I didn't turn down... 




 Fingers crossed, friend 




 Same thing happens to me  




 Other then the fact that I'm running everything on low and my frame rate still manages to take a massive shit at points, dying light feels smart, tense and fun   




 And on the ground next to him are the 4 games the vita has 




 EDIT: Yoooo! Keep em coming guys! :) 




 Sure thing dude bro girl, love your stuff! P.S. srsly I would love to see /u/dustingv idea drawn  




 Oh I'm not ultra pancake :) I'm just a fan who found this on her DA and saw that it hadn't been posted here 




 Na, anything you got really 

EDIT: some of him raging/screaming would be nice, anything else is just gravy
