 VPN needed? 




 I'm using the v3 crack by Team 3DM. The game only crashes when there's something that involves a menu or a loading screen, like traveling, selecting seems to move to your lot, etc. Just save the game often and you should be fine.  




 *cough* Sniper Elite 3 *cough* 




 No surprise. These days, the only thing a game needs to sell is a good marketing campaign to get the hype out there. And if you add a recognized series name to it, bam, you're rich. 




 Alright then. I don't see the day people will buy a long awaited game, try to play it and surprise surprise... "Server is down. Pls wait a few hours. Maybe days" / "Seems like your internet dropped. Game stopped. Sucks for you, usually playing games is what you do in these situations lol". 




 You're comparing Origin to an always online DRM. Origin is NOT an always online DRM. You need an Internet connection to activate a game, and that's it. Maybe people will change their opinion on Origin as it might bring those sales you're talking about. But that won't happen for always online DRM, because it causes the problems I mentioned in the other post. I have absolutely no idea why you say Steam can bring any optimization to a game. Dude, SteamCEG is known for actually decreasing the performance (most DRMs do this to some point, but they certainly never improve it). 




 Yes, I like the way you think, Mr. EA's CEO. Take a sh!t on paying costumers by making a singleplayer game dependent on a stable server connection. And yeah, the online DRM totally worked with Simcity. Everyone could play the game when it was released, and EA got so much love for it. Just like Ubisoft did with their always online DRM a few years ago. Last, but not least, a new study showed that games with aggressive DRM usually sell more. Take a look at Sims 3, for example, it had an uncrackable DRM (CD checks, lol) and thanks to that it sold 10 million units. 




 The crash problem is better now, but still present. It seems to occur in loading screens, not the game per se. It crashed to desktop like 5 times before I could get a Sim to move into my house. SKIDROW didn't release any crack btw. The crack was done by team 3DM. 




 Battlefield 4 




 im a broy btw ;) 




 Sounds like a keeper 




 I go to the bathroom and there's a green rag on the floor of my shower. I get increasingly scared, until everything gets dark and I wake up. 




 Yeah, it was much more likely hacking. The lesson to learn here is that not even a 'secure' cloud service from a reliable company like Apple is safe. Don't take noods. Or if you do, encrypt them in RSA 2048 :) 




 Ignore all these trolls, they're just jealous of your PC. Most of these guys still have a Pentium III and a 6600GT. You can easily play this game on High @1080p, but that CPU would be kind of a bottleneck. For Ultra, you should get a Pentium IV. 512MB of RAM is enough for today's gaming, but keep an eye out for BF5, as it might require 1GB. 




 Hardline is far from an alternative to BF4. It's not too late at all to get Premium, but if you really don't want it, buy Dragon Teeth. Great balance between infantry and vehicles. 




 It's not impressive at all. The guy who killed you just needs to lock at the vehicle, shoot it a little bit to the left/right and after 2/3 shots you're dead. I've done this a lot from the Skyscraper in Siege of Shangai to snipers in other buildings and it's so easy. 




 Optimize my game's graphical options. GeforceExperience my ass. 




 It's not THAT bad, if you're know where to buy. Like, Premium in the US is being sold for 39.99$, and 39.99 in Europe. HOWEVER, if you buy them in a trustworthy cdkey store like G2A, it's actually ~40$ that get converted to ~30. That's how I got my Premium, and so far, haven't had any problems. 




 I payed 60 for a retail copy at launch and barely played it back then. Oh well :p 




 I'm glad you agreed to never be creative again before you ran out of time :) 




 I avoid using the color green. 




 "Big lips for a white guy"  - I'm white. 




 I have:
-Brown eyes (prefer blue)
-Tanned skin (prefer fair)
-No facial hair, except on my chin
-Big lips for a white guy
-Big nose 




 I call bullshit. 




 Swedish. OK, maybe it's because of the blue-eyed blondes. 




 I agree with OP. I get killed much faster when playing in a server with 50ms ping than one with 140ms, it's ridiculous. It's almost impossible to lose a front-to-front when you have a high ping.  




 Ah, thanks. I haven't played much in that map yet. 




 What map is that? 




 Yeah, but which program did you use? 




 How did you extract the texture? 




 Talk about online video games all the time, specially League of Legends. 




 Girls with pale skin and blue eyes. 




 Electronic Arts. Just because they sell unfinished games for full price, split them into several paid DLCs and include micro-transactions doesn't mean that they suck. 
Just kidding. they suck. 




 I get nervous (sometimes blush), as she's attractive and I'm most certainly not. 




 Video doesn't exist? 




 Same! I'm waiting for Duolingo's Swedish course. Sweden is a beautiful country (and the Swedish chicks too :P ) and I would love to know the language.
