 Can anyone make this into a T-Shirt? 




 Nice try, DEA. 




 3004 actually. 




 Dude, he's from England, he must know English the best.  




 Because nothing lasts forever. It's that simple, not even the universe will last forever.  




 Tooth brush, not even twice.  




 How can I send ice cream from Europe without it melting? 




 You wouldn't just automatically be immune to it but the blood transfusion will give you an insanely better chance at surviving.  




 You are a teenager, you are meant to be rebellious, not sit on reddit complaining that your PEERS are breaking the fucking school rules.  




 What type of Internship (like what job)?

Edit: Just saw that you said accounting as her job/internship, accountants earn quite a bit don't they? Maybe she's jealous. 




 Seems legit.  




 Alcohol never really even made me happy when I drank it, drugs like opiates, weed etc actually make me happier with my life, I'm starting to think the government literally just don't want any substance that makes you happier, legal.  




 Cannot be unseen. 




 You do realize that it was normal when I started and it FLUCTUATED to 161-65. 




 Okay, so I bet you've never had ping fluctuations in your life?  




 What? I didn't leave, I didn't even want to leave but my ping went past 160. Did you even read what I said? 




 I was playing cevo about 30 mins ago, I was playing alright and my team wasn't horrible and we got a lot of rounds on T side Nuke, so I had no incentive to leave but because my ping randomly kept fluctuating past 160 for some reason I got "kicked" and couldn't join back because my ping was staying way to high (most likely internet problems or something). So I waited it out and it was back to normal, joined a game until it started and then I got kicked because I was on a cool down because I apparently left the game? But I didn't, I got kicked because my ping kept fluctuating to quite literally 161-65... Just a minor complaint but I think it shouldn't be like that because sometimes you can't really control what your shitty internet does.

Was only banned for 30 mins so it's not too bad... [screenshot](http://gyazo.com/dc48505e62cd889e7e6e6b74255d010c) 




 Now I wanna play CS on acid. 

Good job btw, and as /u/saippuas said, make this into a sticka. 




 That name kinda de humanizes the victim in a way.  




 Maybe they would just fight until the other gets a BSOD.  




 It'll be like Terminator and there will be 3 people alive until all the robots get a bsod.  




 If two AI reach the state of constant victory in boxing, who would win? 




 I used the Sensei MLG (because I'm so MLG) for a few years but now I've upgraded to the zowie FK1, it's a lot lighter imo but the sensor is about 20x better.  




 Maybe people don't wanna say tit because it's extremely offensive and might trigger someone.  




 You said Dick, that's so sexist man. I'm soooo triggered, god.

 




 Are you an archaeologist because I need a big bone examining, Ms. Pretty Lady...
(   ) 




 They should've had the author as God, then everyone would still believe it.  




 Shut up, Jesus.  




 I have D so I'm not sure about C but the only thing that helps me is basically mild/moderate opiates, if I don't have them then I'm fucked mainly because if I don't I'll either be out at school and have to run home while trying not to shit myself, which is harder than it seems. 

I actually like being constipated (that's what opiates do to your GI tract) but it's probably A LOT different than the constipation from IBS-C.

I also get extreme stomach pains from time to time (they don't happen that often) that will literally floor me and make me scream in pain, even if I'm out in public.  




 Fuck you sky news. I'm from Scotland and I think we should have it all over the fucking news and every where else.  




 They still need improvements, some of the meds will literally knock you out for what feels like forever and make you gain a lot of weight that you previously wouldn't have put on. They can also make you feel like an emotionless zombie (but that CAN be due to the schizophrenia, but the meds also do that to you). So they do need to work them out a bit, and I've read recently that schizophrenia is most likely 8 different genetically distinct diseases, so maybe if that's true that'll open the gate for better medication.  




 I was at a psychiatric appointment earlier in the week (Tuesday) and I was basically describing OCD-like "symptoms" if you will, it's basically having to check things constantly until I know it's the way it is and ask someone certain things (not gonna go into detail about it) until I believe them, it's kinda like paranoia but more anxiety driven. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, pretty much every day actually. I used to go for a shower about 6-7 times a day as a kid, but that died down a lot as I got older, and now it's completely opposite. Has anyone here ever noticed anything like this before? In the past or maybe right now or whatever? 




 It would be really nice if they came out with better meds in my life time. The meds right now kinda suck.  




 And child onset schizophrenia is soooo much more rarer than normal onset schizophrenia.  




 120-180mg to start. Not everyone can feel codeine because some people don't have the enzyme that processes it into morphine.  




 TOO SOON... 




 Is this minecraft? 




 Why not meth and crack? 




 Try crack.  




 I would've said... "Woah, you don't know me that well... yet ;)". 




 I usually get moderately depressed (sometimes just mildly) during the winter times, even though I love winter. 




 Can you share some of that cake? 




 Because that would so not be overpowering. /s

Also, RIP headphone users. 




 Isn't var not meant to go above 1 or 2? 




 You're always practising... Pugs, MM, Scrims, are all practice matches.  




 "I am currently MG2 now I can bash on MG1's" 




 Seasonal Depression is thought to be related to human hibernation that possibly happened WAAAAY back.  




 Usually when I use codeine it doesn't last longer than 2 hours. So I wait a couple of half life's to redose, seems to work.  




 If you make a habit out of codeine you can certainly have withdrawals... 




 Or you could just wait 3-6 hours before redosing.  




 Codeine varies between person to person because it's a pro drug. Some people lack a certain enzyme and don't get anything out of it, not even pain relief because their bodies can't properly process it into morphine (or not at all). Anyway, I would dose about 120-180mg (I would really start with around 120-128 though. 

DPH would help with nausea and it will also make the effects stronger (I personally used to like promethazine though, if you can get that). 

Have fun and don't make a habit out of it.  




 Tar is some dirty shit for sure.  




 Why would she cry over LSD? I've never understood that.  




 I can't full on tickle myself, but I can KINDA tickle myself.  




 Amsterdam has always been progressive when it comes to drugs. The rest of the world just needs to speed it up.  




 I personally think all drugs that have been highly researched (most opiates, most stimulants, weed, definitely MOST psychedelics etc) should be fully legal but of course regulated, kinda like alcohol. Except with drugs like opiates and stimulants you can only buy a certain amount every 2 days. 

Alcohol killed people and made them blind when it was illegal back in the 1900s, alcohol STILL kills people but not to the same extent. The reason heroin and the like kill people is because its prohibited. Imagine if heroin was legal, you would know the correct purity at all times, you would have clean needles (so the infection rate of HIV will plummet), there will be MUCH less crime because there will be no need for a black market for these drugs, there will be much less people in prison and there will be a lot more and better rehab/treatment facilities  around. The "war on drugs" is a massive joke and shouldn't still be around, god damn its been about 50 years. COME ON.  




 It has an animal reservoir. Disease with an animal reservoir cannot be fully eradicated. Unless of course you go about trying to immunise all of the animals that are suspected to be holders of ebola, but that would just be simply impossible. 

  




 You can't eradicate Ebola.  




 "Good morning little pussy!" 




 I grew up with a severely alcoholic dad, and a mildly alcoholic mother... You're a good man for divorcing her, alcoholism really hurts a kid.  




 Mustard works for heartburn?  




 I live in the UK and when I tell people that we use diamorphine in the hospitals (and I explain that it's pure heroin) they're shocked and don't believe me until they see it. People here are wakening up a little bit, but there are still a lot of people here that call heroin addicts things like, stupid, useless, smack heads etc. 




 HOLY SHIT, YOUR KID'S A PIRATE! 




 I love how Oxy was in there. I guess some people just don't know it's in the same category of drugs.  




 This guy just doesn't give a fuck any more.  









 That's true but it just seems so funny man, like you've got a bank of drugs in your house.  




 That is extremely overkill, lol.  




 You drunk bro?  




 I've never actually been to Aberdeen and I've lived near Glasgow all my life.  




 This is yet another plot from the Scottish to kill the English.  




 BUT SCOTLAND ISN'T THIRD WORLD, ARGHHHH. *stabbed*. 




 Damn, that's some dedication.  




 God dammit. Reddit comments need to be straight for this. YO REDDIT, THIS IS GAME BREAKING.  




 Trainspotting. Isn't about psychedelics and shit but it portrays the effects (kinda) of heroin and definitely nails the life style opiates bring.  




 Wait... I was supposed to sleep? 




 That's just called bad awareness, some people naturally have good/bad awareness.  




 This has to be just silver 1's, no nova with half a brain is like this.

Also, nice smurfing, I totally respect that. /s 




 Usually m4a1 but I changed when they made the price equal to try the m4a4 out again, but I keep forgetting to change it back to the a1.   




 It's not like MDMA...  




 I would rather go to someone that actually loves what they do rather than just some company that wants as much money as they can eat. You're welcome/Thank you.  




 This guy is basically just an independent store that builds gaming PC's for a living, and if it has problems they usually fix it for you (but it usually doesn't).  




 Rather them smoking mid than smoking meth.  




 We're all addicted here, muahahahah... 




 I give a list of components to some computer IT guys that I've known for a while (but not like a regular, just go there when I want a new PC built) and they build it for me (it's a small indie store).  




 Do they know what those 8 different disorders are? Asking out of interest.  




 *Stronk. 




 What rank are they? ESEA Invite? lol. 




 Why not both? 




 Yeah, it usually does. But for me it's as if it's there, but not really, if you get me? That's why I said it's a mix of outside voices and inner voices, it's a weird thing. I've also had inner monologue being corrupted by some jackasses, dunno what that's about though. 




 I don't know. Only tried Abilify (Sucks for me, made me worse), Amisulpride and now Seroquel, seroquel seems to be fine I guess.  




 What about weight gain on it? 




 No one knows what causes mental illness. No one seems to really care either. Where is our charity for schizophrenia research? If there is one, I hardly even hear of it.  




 Well, voices can come from both inside and outside I believe, but it's mainly a weird combo of both IME.  




 Who knows? No one seems to really know. Ask your doctor why your meds "work" or don't work, they have no clue... Why is psychiatry so behind when psychiatric illnesses can literally disable you as badly as not being able to walk?

Edit: Oh and happy christmas :) 




 It's pretty awesome, done it before. I think it's for the purpose of when you're at lan so you can identify your mouse or something.  




 Yeah, I do kinda feel my rank ups coming now since I've been ranking up somewhat fast lately, every 2-3 wins usually. The anticipation is great. 




 They really should make an official statement on how it exactly works, would help me understand why I rank up fast sometimes but slow other times, even though I either do better, or the same. 




 Thank you, my friend. 




 Basically, I don't fully understand how the ranking system works exactly. I thought it was based completely on the Elo system but then the guy from Valve said it's more "complex than that"... How does it exactly work? Is it based on wins/losses, performance or both? 




 Fucking, Supreme's... 




 I like it when the eating noises scrape against my inner ear and make them bleed... Feels good.  




 'MURRRICAAA
