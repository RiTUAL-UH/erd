 You want to know what is wrong with the tea cup ride?! That fact that it isn't a ride that has a height requirement. I want to enjoy the rides that my kids CAN'T go on!  Totally forgot about the restaurant in Pirates. I will have to go there, too! Childless. Yes!  




 Fun fact:
My husband and I are going to Disneyland next Friday for our anniversary... Without any of our 3 kids. Muahahaha(that was evil laughter, in case you couldn't tell)! This way we get to ride the bigger kid rides. Screw the little kids and their stupid Teacup and It's a Small World rides. I am about to make your plot twist a reality! BAM! 




 It's supposed to rain on Thursday in Southern California. Well, this is according to the weather app on my iPhone. So, it probably won't rain after all. I guess I will put my rain boots away.  :( 




 Not smart... or possibly a drunk? 




 Quick... Someone try a laser pointer! 




 Up... Fucking... Vote  




 I fucking love that someone actually took the time to make a video of how to fix that.

***thinking*** 

"HMMM... What should I do today? Oh, know just the thing!" 




 Nope. I honestly made it because I am extremely over all of the posts. None of them were funny in the first place.
