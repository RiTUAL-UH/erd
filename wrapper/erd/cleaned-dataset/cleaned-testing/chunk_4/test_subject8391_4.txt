 You are absolutely correct and there is nothing I can do about it. That will teach me not to proof my titles before submitting... 














 Anyone can do the free telescope viewing, but for most it will cost money to get into Grand Canyon national park. However, the military can [get into all national parks for free](https://store.usgs.gov/pass/military.html) making a true freebie for them.

 All good -- I didn't realize the discussion had already taken place -- no need to have it again;) 




 haha -- I did and that screen never came up -- if you look at the previous submitted story, it was linked to a comment in the article, not to the main article so the Reddit system never flag this as a repost.  






































































































































 I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this yet. You shouldn't be paying for toothpaste at all (brand name or not) if you have a CVS nearby. Several times a year you should be able to match a coupon with a CVS bucks promotion to get the toothpaste for free -- both Colgate and Crest. I don't think I've paid for toothpaste in 5 years.
 

















































 Unfortunately, yesterday (June 5) was the last day of the offer...

 Thank you. 




 I'm not sure what this means. I'm not really a roulette player. It was an example that came up in a conversation I had. 




 haha -- I wish I was still in school. No, it came up in a conversation and I was just wondering how to solve it since thinking about it was just getting me confused. 




 If I were to play roulette and bet either black or red, how would I figure out the odds of winning 30 times in a row? 




 It has a [lot of issues even if it does get made](http://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2013/11/15/1018853_coin-credit-card-device.html) that doesn't make it so appealing including a limit of 7 cards and the battery dies after a couple years with no way to replace it but to buy another Coin device. Also, the [credit card companies haven't approved it](http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/17/technology/innovation/coin-startup-credit-card/index.html) and it doesn't work if your phone battery dies. 









 In the scheme of things it could have been [far, far worse](http://www.hellokittyhell.com) 



















 Most people know that quarters and dimes before 1965 are made of silver and those made in 1965 and after have no silver content. Many people assume it's true for half dollars as well, but it's not. While half dollars made from 1965 - 1970 have less silver (40%) than those made 1964 and earlier (90%), their silver content still makes them worth much more than 50 cents. Check with your bank if anyone has recently cashed in half dollars in rolls, and if they have, buy them. There will often be half dollars from 1965 - 1970 in them. 




 I learned this from a friend who is a well know fashion stylist. The very best way to save money on clothes is to find your ideal weight and keep it. If you weight is constantly changing, you will spend a fortune on clothes as they won't fit before they wear out.
