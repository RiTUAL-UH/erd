There's a Colossal statue of a winged human-headed bull from the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in The British Museum and its partner is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

The  colossal statue winged bull you see being destroyed with sledgehammers  in the ISIS video looks to me like a duplicate.

 Just a thought that, if you can count them, you can shut them down, continuously, until they stop sprouting new heads.

Pro ISIS Asawitiri media's 104th Twitter account was just suspended. Shutting them down doesn't do much except make a few armchair twitter anti-jihadists feel good about themselves for mass reporting. 

I don't know how they got the number 46,000. I'd think it's impossible to give a conclusive number of how many 'real' supporters they have on twitter because many twitter accounts are actually run by terrorism analysts and government agency's for analysis, to gain access to their online forums and for other reasons. 
























 Agree. 

Al Jazeera's Jane Arraf tweeted that they used a bulldozer to level the winged bull statue. I think that statue might be an imitation. The British Museum has one and it's partner is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

See http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/colossal_statue_winged_bull.aspx  




 A chemist could easily produce explosives and toxic materials 









 It seems the PLO is not happy with this.

They [decided today to end security cooperation with Israel](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2y22ko/the_palestinian_liberation_organisations_central/). 


This leaves the 92,000 Palestinians who worked for Israelis and had a 55% average increase in salary over their peers in the Palestinian territories  at risk of losing their jobs.

It's hard for me to comprehend the sick logic behind this .

-
Just now I read on twitter that a PA Official was quoted as saying

"The decision to suspend security coordination with Israel was not taken by the Palestinian Authority and is just a **recommendation**"

Maybe it was just a bluff 

Don't know what to believe

 Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for 'territorial integrity guarantees' from NATO including America... and Russia.

The [agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm) cites, 

NATO vows to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, i.e. not to invade it, and it's member states will "consult together" if the country is threatened.

It would be a non issue 'if' American troops were involved in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty. While Russia must abide to the NATO vows and not attack Ukraine's sovereignty. This is why on 1 April 2014, NATO decided to suspend practical co-operation with Russia. 




 Why would a Palestinian work for the

92,000 Palestinians disagree with you. They worked in Israels private sector until now and were happy with it. The decision to stop security cooperation's with Israel is PLO politics.  

Israeli government 

Most if not all work in the private sector

whom withholds $100,000,000 in tax revenue

Although I disagree with Israels practice, Hamas has 209.7 million dollars of electricity payments taken from Palestinians that rightfully belong to Israel's electricity company

thus punishing millions of people.

It's mostly Hamas who is punishing the people

Seems that the 92k workers are fed up of the gangster liar Israeli government

You are wrong 92,000 times. 









 This means 92,000 Palestinians who worked for Israelis and had a 55% average increase in salary to their peers in the Palestinian territories are now at risk of losing their jobs.

 Major Vivian Gilbert of the British Army book Romance of the Last Crusade is a mostly sober account of Field Marshal Edmund Allenby's capture of Palestine during World War I. At one point, the book breaks into a humorous account of why the mayor of Jerusalem surrendered his city to the British four times. Major Gilbert, insists that he was present at the Jerusalem army headquarters and personally witnessed most of what occurred.

 Cattle walking the last mile to this slaughterhouse are treated to this dazzling, but incongruous display of light before the end in Gross-Umstadt near Darmstadt, West Germany, on November 29, 1962. The chandelier came from a nearby factory that didn't have room to assemble it there, so they decided to assemble it in this slaughterhouse. The name of the Arab ruler who ordered the 532 bulb chandelier made up of 200,000 separate parts is a secret. Also, a secret is the price he paid for it.

  There are two different straits important to the Battle of Leyte Gulf. One is Surigao Strait, at the southern entrance to Leyte Gulf. The other is San Bernadino Strait, between Luzon and Samar, which you must pass through to enter Leyte Gulf from the east if you are coming from the west (Leyte Gulf opens east and south).

The reports also confirmed previous sinking claimed by the Commander THIRD Fleet and confirmed extensive damage to the remain-ing Japanse battleships which were now either in navy yards under repair or operating at reduced efficiency.

 What a joke

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has called for an end to "shameful" political killings in Russia.
