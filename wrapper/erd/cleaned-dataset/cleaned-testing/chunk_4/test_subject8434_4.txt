 I can't see  




 The camel in the back of my house died facing the USA sign meaning we will win every World Cup for now on  




 I thought he meant he didn't like him personally not professionally, two different things. 




 Sure just gimmie an hour and I can 




 I need some papers to be translated from Arabic to English anyone willing to help me? 




 I'm ahead of the game since I've been pirating it my whole life  




 #ibelieve 




 Funny things is my brother was sent over seas for a situation I don't remember. Not saying we aren't justified but if your youth doesn't remember why we're fighting isn't time to give it.  




 You haven't bought anything sense Monday? 




 How do you delete a post? 














 Idk I just installed it and it worked  




 Working on my 5c 




 I'm thinking around $20 and not a counterfeit. I'm broke as shit and would like to support my team but the jerseys are expensive as hell. 




 What if we take what our body produces and enhances it? 














 What do they say? 




 Even then the pace of the European game is much faster then the American basketball  









 Sims and fifa 




 Time won't be wasted tho since they have extra balls that they throw in regardless. 




 Not really trying to steal one just let the stadium allowing to take one 




 A good ball once in a whole never hurts 




 And how much do they pay for those balls I doubt it's 200 dollars and if so is it not about the fans. The whole point of the game is let the fans enjoy themselves and have an attachment to the game and the players. What's not better then a free ball from their favorite footballer to keep that fan hood? 




 I say about 3 -4 balls go into stands every game to the billions of dollars fifa gets yearly.  




 Usually fans throw the ball back on the pitch and then there's two balls on the field which makes a delay either way time will be wasted. I believe we should be allowed to keep a ball for memory of the game like other sports do it's kinda unfair that we have to return and only have a cup with a team name to show for it. 




 Wasting time? There's ball boys that have extra balls. 




 That's what I was thinking  




 To hell with rules if a famous footballer kicks a 200 dollar ball to my face hell ya imma keep it  














 If it's approved when will it finish? 




 I will be excited when I piss in their toilet so I know it's real 



















 I tried it earlier says I need for register and I prefer not too  




 God damn comcast and 2 recording limit, I can't watch the damn game
