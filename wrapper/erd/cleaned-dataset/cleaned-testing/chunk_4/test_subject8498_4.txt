 This may come off as pretty random but, as an argentinian, me da mucha vergenza los comentarios que algunos de mis compatriotas hacen frente a lo que pas, alegrndose del caos.  Espero que entiendan que no todos los argentinos somos tan estpidos como para pensar que que les pasen cosas malas a nuestros vecinos de Chile es motivo de festejo. De todo corazn deseo que puedan recuperarse pronto y siento mucho las perdidas que han sufrido.

Edit: sorry, a bit of context. Some argentinians hate chileans and visceversa, which is of course a pretty idiotic thing to do, and they are glad each time something like this happens in Chile. I'm just saying to the guy that as an argentinian myself I hope he doesn't think we are all like that and that I'm very sorry about what happened and hoping that they recover from their losses soon. Sorry to hijack the comment thread but I didn't come cross a chilean these days and seeing what my fellow countryman are saying, just wanted to put it out there.

 Have you ever heard about that theory that says in the future a super intelligent AI will take control of the planet and it's robot minions will torture you basically for eternity unless you've contributed to their creation? And also they have a method in which they can tell exactly how many times you thought about this without doing anything, and each time only makes it worse and they torture you even harder for it? 

I read it on Reddit, of course. It's like The Game but super hardcore mode.

EDIT: got a link, apparently it's called "Roko's Basilisk" http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk 




 Te recomiendo usar InstaSize para eso!

 You can't email things. Yet.

 Well, did you? 




 That's the exact reason not to climb a huge ass building, because you only live once.

 Getting them off your back isn't hard, but what's really shitty is how when you're in the middle of fucking nowhere and shot a guy with noone around with a silenced pistol, cops come looking for you almost instantly. It's very irritating.

 That's a great saying. This is actually a known process, which of course I can't recall the name now (maybe someone else does) in which the person uses every bit of information, even the ones that contradict them, to build their belief stronger. For example, a pseudoscience study comes along saying that vaccinations and autism are severely related = this must be true, their belief grows stronger. Then a scientific study properly made comes along and says vaccinations and autism aren't related = this must be false, their belief grows stronger. It's very irritating. 




 I see a bearded face in the middle, with a hoodie and some sort of Winnieh Pooh ears

 I run it on a 460 with an Athlon II x3 455 and 6GB of DDR2, 50-60fps on all minimum 1080p, and it doesn't even kook that bad 




 It's karma, man. Worthless internet points. Who cares if you have 0, 10000 or 6705012548503? It's not money, it's not profitable, why put a log(n) or what not? Just a non important number. 




 
 using the other humans as bait.

Hey snake! This human has a special taste, if you eat him you **won't believe** what happens next!
 

 




 And money. Come to think of it going to grandma's is as close as returning to base for mana and hp regen as we get 




 I would do to, it's amazing how totally crazy things occur to us when high that seem to have perfect sense and are either truly Mind blowing or utter shit haha 









 I don't know man. I have two pieces myself but I love the ritual that comes with smoking a joint, from the rolling to the credits roll 




 I'm sorry, I posted the wrong link before when I intended to post this one. 









 Dawkings talks abouts theories that are backed up with science, and doesn't say (nor denies) that atoms are sentient, because he (scientifical community as a whole actually) doesn't have the slightlest evidence that would point towards that. Chopra could be right, but he's talking out of his ass, he has absolutely NO evidence to support what he's saying, and he says it smiling and ridiculising science. It's very upseting. 




 Dogdamnit 




 /r/atheism was a default? Lol, what the fuck? I'm an atheist myself but that entire place is a giant circlejerk of idiots who jack off at their own posts. And even if this wasn't the case, why make a religious based subreddit a default? Seems weird. 




 Hey, I know life can get pretty though sometimes. Hell, I've known lives that were though since they existed. But trust me when I say to you, it can get better. It's in the power of our inmense will and effort, but it sure can. I advice you seek professional help if you haven't yet, and in the meantime, check /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression.  

If you may trust the words of a random internet stranger, I promise you you can turn this survival into a pleasant living. 




 Wow I can't believe somebody didn't bought you gold thinking it a was a really average comment.. 




 And thus a new Reddit joke is born 




 I have an Athlon II x3 455, 6GB DDR2 and a geforce 460, and I'm reluctant of buying the game in case I get 20fps, do you guys think I'll be able to play it at a good frame rate? 40is good for me

 What's happening here 




 Eons 




 I just want to open that jar and be one with the smell 




 I think I speak for most ents here when I say we thought you smoked way less haha 




 Don't lose hope.

 Ah, I get it now. Thanks! 




 What reference am I missing here?

 I understood those words! 




 Technically, everything is a thing. 




 Ha, didn't know you guys said they had 9. Here (Argentina) we say 7, don't know why the difference! 




 Estuve buscando info sobre el tema pero mucho no encuentro. Especficamente quera saber si el CBC se cursa estos das o no.

 He doesn't want the D. He wants the entire alphabet. 




 Yeah, no worries, this is Reddit. Most of us don't know what the hell we're doing. 




 Totally cool man! Thanks for it. 




 I just LOVE the bad voice acting of this intro. Also the shots, the haircuts, the CGI, it all looks like a cheap 90s porno. It's awesome. 




 Oops! You're right, I messed that up. Not being a native speaker leads to this kind of situations :( 




 I just can hear his wife thinking "why the fuck did I marry this idiot" 




 He reminded me of [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/G5q68OP.jpg)

 What did it say? 




 This is fucking incredible 




 Y ac una de Presman a Leuco, en respuesta a su carta

http://radiocooperativa.com.ar/carta-abierta-a-alfredo-leuco/ 




 I like to sit, take 1 hour, put Netflix, and roll myself 8 or 10 joints. I first grind the bud, then carefully cut the filters and proceed with the rolling. I take my time so that every joint is perfect and nice in size and thick. I enjoy so much this process.  

Then, I save them in a metal Camel box I have that's only meant for saving joints.   

It's beautiful. It's good. It brings me joy. 

I haven't smoked in a couple of months. Now I've got my job back, money coming, and as I write this I'm waiting to go pick up the bud I love so much. Smiling is inevitable right now.

Just wanted to share it :) 




 What would happen with matter in that case? I'm sorry if this is a nonsensical question.

Edit: thanks so much for all the great answers! 




 Haha 




 It's been around for 11 months but I feel like I'm noticing it just these past days, it's awesome. 




 *smoke signal* 




 It was, and I mean, I get the whole "don't comment that, just upvote" thing, but hey, the guy was just expressing his joy, no need to massively downvote him like that (siting at -50 now) 




 Yeah pls NSFW tag... 




 Yeah, it's preferable to go easy, at least for me. Getting to this state very quickly can lead me to a bad trip, don't want that. 




 Yeap that's enough reddit for today 




 One day, brother, one day... 




 This made me cry. Thank you for such beautiful words. 




 Nos watch it again and say that one more time but backwards 




 So yes scooters? 




 Hm, yes, you are correct; I did misinterpret the vignette here. But, although the photographer (or editor) didn't use a vignette technique, I stand saying there's an over saturation of the colors and lighting of the face in comparison to the rest of the picture. That, and the natural framing of the background (that tends to darken to the edges) produce a very much vignette alike effect on the eye.  

So, while technically the use of vignette isn't here (we can notice that if we look at the evenly lightened grass), the effect achieved is the same, by other techniques. For my taste, the lion's face "stands out too much", as in an excess for seeking attention to it.

Let us all please remember that photography is a form of art, and as in all forms of art you can bend and break rules (to a point I believe), and althought I wouldn't have processed this picture as it is because I dislike the end result, I believe it's what the photographer wanted and I respect that. Of course constructive criticism helps, and it should be fomented, not bashed in saying "redditors say it's over processed always".  




 Not in DSLRs. I also believe some C41s film rolls came with midstep  ASA/ISO, but I may be wrong there. 




 I too am a professional photographer, and what /u/drakeg4 is saying is essentially correct. Use of vigneting should be subtle in most cases (of course there are no unbreakable rules in these fields), and generally an excess of it produces a weird effect. It's mostly used to emulate natural frames and help the composition of the photo by drawing the eye to the desired point, but here I too believe it's overused.  

I also see an over saturation of the face colors in comparison with the rest of the photo. Again, to each it's own and I believe the photographer achieved what he wanted, that this is the final result he had in mind. But I also don't like it and I think the argument that the user you replied to have is far from invalid. 




 No, of course I didn- YEAH I DID SO WHAT 




 Bu- I SAID GET OVER IT

 Hi!

Well, I read here somewhere that tachyons aren't possible because they represent a violation in causality. So far so good. But, the explanation to why this happens doesn't quite get in my head. A redditor kindly wrote an example about two spaceships that are in a duel. The two of them travel away from each other at great velocity until they count 10 seconds, and then spaceship A fires their tachyon cannons to spaceship B. But, because of time dilation, 5 seconds have passed for spaceship B when they get hit, so they respond immediatly by firing, sending the blast before spaceship A fired the initial shot.

Now, I get why that violates causality (obviously), but the thing I don't get is; why does time dilation makes the time happen differently for both spaceships if they're traveling away from each other at the same speed? Wouldn't their 10 seconds be the same 10 seconds for both of them since they're at same speed? 




 Woah... The Universe is pretty fucking huge 




 Thanks for your answer, I was under the missconception of thinking there was galaxies and stars formed of antimatter. 




 Could there be life formed by anti matter? 




 Yes! Why is that?

 Haha this is genious, I didn't catch it there either.
