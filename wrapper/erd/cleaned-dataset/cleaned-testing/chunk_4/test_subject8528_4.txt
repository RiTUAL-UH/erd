 Better yet, according to a tweet from the animation studio, that was a single unrehearsed take. 




 Sorry that it took me so long to respond.

Here are the three figures that I have:

* [Sengoku Nadeko](https://i.imgur.com/fOzb9qi.jpg) from Monogataru Second Season (This is the one I won from the crane game)

* [Saber](https://i.imgur.com/axrrMeF.jpg?1) from Fate/Stay Night

* [Saber Lilly Nendoroid](http://i.imgur.com/jSKdPsz.jpg) (Nendoroids are basically a small figure with an accented head size. They are also modular.) 




 I, personally, have no idea. I know what if you want the $4.99 pricing you have to sign up on their education page, but I do not know if it works with this three month deal. The best bet would be to contact Spotify and ask. 




 Dang it, the suspense is killing me! 




 I feel the same way about this. I, basically, do not talk about anime/manga at all unless someone else references or brings it up in a conversation. If they do and it is in a public situation where others can hear, I act as though I know nothing.

I had the opportunity to go to Japan this year as part of a class trip and I did pick up a few things while I was there. I was extremely hesitant to buy any sort of figure but I won one from a crane game at a Taito Game Station. 

My Mom thinks they are cool and I have no idea what my Dad thinks of them... :/ 




 Nope. I worded it wrong. When I said "this deal" I was thinking of the linked one. I guess you could try and do the $0.99 for three months, cancel and try for the student pricing but YMMV. 




 If you are a college student in the US and have access to a .edu email address you can get Spotify Premium for $4.99 a month. 

This deal gives you premium at $0.99 a month for three months then $9.99 from there on out. 




 People will say it belongs on /r/aww rather than here. 




 Sail the high seas. 




 Is it really yuri? We, the viewer, know that TailRed is a guy but Dark Grasper doesn't... 




 With After Story keep on watching the rest of the episodes. 




 This should be interesting... 

Also, as a heads up one of the later pages is NSFW. 




 As a heads up, Reddit doesn't like self-promotion. The general rule of thumb is that your self-promotional posts to a subreddit should be less than 10% of the contributions to the same subreddit. 

I've seen people banned for not doing as such. 




 Someone ought to recreate Spice and Wolf as one of those children's books along the line of "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie..." but as "If You Give a Wolf an Apple..." 




 I think there are some people over on /r/anime that are doing a Haruhi Suzumiya rewatch. 




 The fan translated ones were taken down when the novels were licensed in English.

So far, in the official releases, I haven't come across any weird grammatical errors but there is going to be a debate on whether it is Horo or Holo for her name. 




 You ought to read the books. Season 1 covers volumes 1 and 2. Season 2 covers volumes 3 and 5.

There are 12 volumes out right now in English. 




 I know this is digressing, but oh well. Black Rock Shooter is, originally, a Hatsune Miku song by Supercell. I do not remember the name/username of the person, but someone made a music video having the character, which is heavily influenced by the character design of Hatsune Miku, go through the story in the lyrics through the video. That music video and story got really popular which prompted a novel, manga, OVA, anime, merchandise, etc into what you know today.


Sorry about that, I used to be into vocaloid stuff a few years ago and I remember when this was all happening. I haven't, other than knowing f and f2 are out and Mirai on the 3DS soon, been following the scene for awhile.  




 For the past few weeks, I have been reading a number of light novels, but I am trying to find ones that are mainly romance/comedy oriented.

The only real requirement that I have is for the novels to:

1. Not have ecchi
2. An MC that isn't a blatant self-insert. (What I mean by that is a setting where the MC goes from some recluse to having a harem overnight because he is nice to them. These are, mainly, the fantasies of the author and as such they do not have a lot of depth)
3. Not a lot of vocabulary that is unique to the story. I get it that they have to describe certain mechanics, but there are better ways to ago about world building without is being a bunch of random terms together.

Some examples of what I am looking for:

* Hikaru ga Chikyuu ni Itakoro......
* Toradora
* Hyouka

While it may seem that I am only asking for realistic romance stories, that isn't the case but they are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head. (Heck, Index could work here.) 




 Try loading the map in Hammer. There isn't a ledge to stand on as it is boxed off all the way up to the sky. 




 I hope they will animate that. 




 Some people are working on a translation patch for the game right now. They have up through what the trial version of the game offers and you can get the patch here: http://libraryshepherd.tumblr.com/post/103642341617/remember-when-i-said-ill-update-weekly

I hope it doesn't turn out like all of the other August VN TL efforts where the group drops/stops working on it or even worse, goes dark. This happened for Yoake Mae, Fortune Arterial and Aiyoku no Eustia so far... :( 




 It is fun, once you get the radio working, to just load up and tool around in every so often. It isn't demanding and it is a nice change of pace compared to most games out there. 




 It reminded me of this [gif.](https://i.imgur.com/i3eLl.gif) 




 I don't feel like reposting my comments again, but I had a conversation about this back on the article (also on /r/games) where I discussed the potential impact of the game being in the anime. 

[Here is the comment chain.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2jvx0z/terraria_console_sales_top_300000_in_japan/clfmq6l?context=3) 




 Well, there is Saber Lily but that is a "different" Saber. 




 This reads like an ad for some guys book which people will get for free which will then push said book higher up the charts which results in people buying it when it goes back to its original price.

Heck, OP copy and pasted the same chunk of the text twice. 




 You need to include a link to the site and other information. 




 Anything is better than nothing. Also, I believe that YouTube only contacts those who meet certain qualifications for monetization. 

No one know how much they are going to make for sure since the CPM differs on the demographics that the videos bring in as advertisers are going to target their demographic.

I can say, however, that if you are going to do it be aware that, unless you join a network, you will only get paid when you reach $100 in your pending amount on AdSense. (This is public information and it is not a statement of how much I, personally, have made through YouTube.) 




 Who wouldn't? People who do not want to be charged with a felony for it is considered fraud. 




 A woman is live streaming them driving around Ferguson right now, a number of fires and cops. http://www.ustream.tv/channel/heatherdemian 




 This would be great! 




 [Here](https://vndb.org/r?q= fil=lang-en.plat-psp) is a list of VN's that are available on the PSP.

There is a blog that compiles VNs that can run through homebrew on the PSP.

EDIT: Removed link due to the site giving you download links for the games. Just search "visual novels on PSP" and you should find it. 




 Nope, it is part of the contract. Even if it wasn't it is poor form to ask someone for their salary. 




 Depenidng on how the adblock works, it will do one of two things:

* Block the ads from loading = No impression

* Load but hide the ads (This is how it works on Chrome) = Same as loading but not clicking the ad. (I'm not sure about how video ads work when blocked) 




 It is a combination of the video ads, the ads on the side and the ones that pop up during the video on the bottom. Someone who is monetized can set which of these ads are shown or all of them.

It is and isn't on views. You are insunating that it is determined by someone watching the video, but even going on the page and having it up will cause an "impression". (aka ad view)

Google has been in the advertising business for years so it is near impossible to exploit and if you do your account will be frozen and you will no longer be monetized. (Youtube uses Google's AdSense platform for ads)
 




 Huh, that must be new as I remember reading a few interviews of large youtubers and they claimed that they were unable to disclose how much they earn.  




 No one who makes money from YouTube is allowed to disclose their earnings. My, personal, channel is monetized and that is something that YT drills into you when you join. 




 For those of you who have also played/watched Little Busters, imagine Rin saying those lines. (Same VA) 




 I found Yuuki: --- , 




 Recently, I have been running out of good romance/comedy anime to watch so I'm turning to visual novels.

I played the demo/trial for NekoPara today and it is basically what I am looking for but the cat ears are not necessary. I've been playing a bit of Hoshizora no Memoria and I have heard that it is a moege, butI haven't gotten that far into it.
 




 Gate 7, which is CLAMP's newest work due to the terminology and required knowledge of Japanese mythology.

I liked Tsubasa up until *that* point but I am not too sure about this new one. 




 You'll have to search around online. A good place to start would be the VNDB listing which should have a link to the patch for the game.

You'll need a copy of the game that you ripped or from sites that cannot be linked. 




 Nope, the site is safe. Most people put a warning on TVTropes links because if you aren't careful you could lose a lot of time thumbing through various pages of tropes and series. 




 What is even better is the description:

 Charles Barkley was a child prodigy at basketball. Anybody with him on their team would automatically win. He was just that good. After his mother, who was also his coach, died, he had a mental breakdown and refused to join a team ever again.
 
 Two years later, Barkley still hasn't come to terms with his mother's loss. Every time he tries to make a shot, he can no longer see where the basket is. He's resigned himself from ever playing basketball again, and enjoys his life spending time with Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning, as they enjoy their favorite sports.
 
 That is, until Michael Jordan comes along. Jordan's a free-spirited basketball player, and he sparks Barkley into trying to learn how to play again. He teaches him that basketball isn't just about making the shot: it's about enjoying the thrill of the game. 




 Check [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality) under "Anime/Manga".

WARNING: TVtropes link! 




 It depends. 




 It is a site called Mechanical Turk which is owned and operated by Amazon. They allow requesters, who are mainly either researchers or companies, who need people to tasks that computers cannot do such as surveys or even classifying images and such.   You have to be a US Citizen and have a SSN which you will have to provide Amazon for the I-9 form for taxes. If you make more than $600 a year Amazon has to send you the form to fill out for income tax purposes. 

There is always work to do and there are opportunities for higher pay once you do a number of hits. (Typically 1000 and 5000) The minimum rate you want to shoot for is $0.10 a minute. ($6 an hour) but it pays a lot better than swagbucks and what not. 




 My guess it is because shows that normally don't have much of a plot like this one have stepped things into high gear this week. 




 Lagoon sends any computer into a frenzy.  




 If you are in the US you ought to sign up for Mturk. It is run by Amazon and it is the only site where I have been able to make any sort of substantial income on the side. (I've made ~$900+ over about two years of off and on work on the site. With going to college, I'll end up stopping for 3-4 months at a time or more too.) 




 Good luck trying to avoid the alt-fire of the triple threat. It can go pretty far. 




 I'm not /u/BitterRamen, but I think they might have done that because it keeps on bouncing between Easy Going Scans and HorribleSubs. 




 Better yet, that was a single take without a rehearsal.

EDIT: Fixed up my grammar as it was a mess.  




 It is the post that is kept "Stickied" on the top of the subreddit.  




 It is stickied to the top of the subreddit. 




 Try posting this in the daily purchase suggestion thread. It also says in big letters over the submission box that requests are to go in that thread. 




 It is right near a Gundam Cafe too. 




 Gekkan Shoujo went down due to the first volume having an event ticket. (Which always boosts sales by quite a bit) 




 One nice thing about paypal is that if there is any issues you can file a claim and get a refund. 

It could be someone just trying to make a fast sale, but it does seem really cheap. 




 Thing is, you can do "define: terrorism" and it will give you a definition. 




 While it isn't a reviewer, I always find XboxAhoy's videos to be entertaining and pretty educational. 




 Technically, "Saber is my blood" works better as mana is found in blood and it is by Shirou's mana, thereby his blood, that Saber is able to exist. 




 As a heads up, you have to get your tickets well in advance as there is normally a three or more month wait list. Why is there such a long wait list for it? They only admit 200 people per day.

Also, it is really hard to get tickets outside of Japan since you have to get them at a Lawson (A chain of convenience stores in Japan) or through a [designated travel agency.](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/) (The link is to the Ghibli Museum's page about how to get tickets outside of Japan) 




 Old comment, but there are the ones in the same "universe":

* [Please Teacher](http://myanimelist.net/anime/195/Onegai%E2%98%86Teacher) - A certain character looks a lot like Remon.
* [Please Twins](http://myanimelist.net/anime/196/Onegai_Twins) 




 If you are in college and have an edu email and access to your class schedule you can bring down the price of Premium to $5 a month if you are in the US. 




 It is kind of hidden too. There is the shop outside, but unbeknownst to a number of people the actual Tokyo Anime Center is inside. 

When I went in May they had stuff for Mahouka and Black Bullet. 




 Took less than 24 hours! 




 Oh okay, when I was in Japan for two weeks I went into a manga cafe and saw that they had volume 32. I didn't have enough time to look for more volumes as the group I was with was being too loud and we got shoo'ed out but that is another story. 




 It is by the same mangaka as Pastel, which is a similar but much longer series. (Some say it drags on, but I think that is in part to the lack of people translating it. I know, for a fact since I saw it myself, that the series is at least up to volume 32 in Japan but the translations are around volume 28.) 




 Well, they have announced that they are going to put up a kickstarter to license three of the Grisaia games which were made by Frontwing. (The first one has already been translated and it is regarded as one of the best translations yet.) They are going to edit and fix up the first game and then, if they get enough as they are stretch goals, translate the next two games and they might even license the Magical Girl Chiruchiru spin off. 




 It is already around 107k, it will be funded. 




 **WARNING: The scene above has MASSIVE spoilers.** 




 My thought on the stretch goals is that they could try and get the PS3 art assets.

Other than that, I'd love for Sekai to put that money towards another of Key's VNs such as Little Busters, Rewrite or even Angel Beats. 




 What about the PS3 assets?
 




 My guess would be that they would try and get the PS3's art assets which were greatly improved over the original artwork along with being a higher resolution. 

**NOTE:** I am ***NOT*** affiliated with Sekai Project or Key/Visual Arts. 




 Same thing is hitting Iris Zero... :'( 




 I watched the wheat field scene on YouTube and it threw me into a spiral of depression for a few months. It has that sort of impact. 




 I wasn't able to get it today as when I go to my usual dining location on campus, there weren't that many people around so they weren't saving tables. I should be able to do it tomorrow. 




 The anime, which is based upon the visual novel, is extremely popular in both the Japanese and Western communities. While I haven't played the visual novel, the anime is one of the few that have made me cry and the only one that has made any serious impact upon my life. (You may think I am crazy, but Clannad made me look at family and what it all entails in a new way.)

The visual novel is also known for its extreme length. I remember reading, according to a walkthrough, that even knowing where the branch points are and where to save, to read all of the routes takes anywhere from 90-120 hours. Otherwise it is closer to 200-300 hours of reading.

The VN and anime is renowned for its soundtrack and the usage of these tracks to emphasize certain scenes. If you want to listen to it, the OST is on iTunes in most countries.

**EDIT:** To give you an idea, the amount of hype around this coming to the English markets in the visual novel fanbase is along the lines of Valve announcing Half-Life 3. People thought it would never happen and yet, here it is. 




 If the HPA4 has USB input you don't need the optical input as the PS4 can do it without it. 




 They leave their phones and even wallets to save their table/seat. If you want, I can even get a picture tomorrow to prove it. 




 Nah, he has you beet^^^^hoven. 




 There is. All you have to do is call the intern and tell him to write the script. 




 I didn't use proxies, but my account was under review last December. It took about a week or two for the investigation to be over and they didn't find anything and turned the account back over to me.

So, yes, people have had their account under review and not been banned before. 




 It isn't that different than the historical building designation in the US and I imagine other countries have something similar. 




 They are in Japan. 




 I go to college in the US and it is like that where people leave their stuff on tables and just walk away to go get food. I think it is due to the school being entirely fenced in and all of the entrances/exits are manned. They check for a student ID when people try and enter. 




 Oh, my thought is that she purposefully didn't show up so that he had the opportunity to perform for people without the stress of a competition looming over him. 




 Try /r/learnjapanese 




 Doki wasn't the original translation group. They were working through Clannad and, supposedly, retranslating it before Sekai picked it up. Sekai, initially, announced a partnership with Doki but since then Sekai has announced that they are going to hire a professional translator to do the game. (People are wondering if they are going to hire Doki's translator or not) 




 There is the possibility that it will be fan translated. 




 "Bugger off" and "wanker" could be considered to be inappropriate. I have no idea where you are from, but Reddit is a culmination of different cultures and ideas and some idea which are appropriate one place may not be elsewhere. 




 Sure, lets have people by a speaker that has seven microphones that are always listening and can even pick up what you say over other noises! 

This isn't an invasion of privacy or anything! ^^^^Suckers... 




 His books are available online for free from his website. I remember reading that if you like his books to buy a copy and donate it to a school or public library. 




 That sort of language is inappropriate for the subreddit. Consider this to be your warning. 




 [Outbreak Company](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company)

[Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - One of my favorites, but note that each episode is double length. (~45 minutes per episode) 




 You can click "Change Layout" on the right which allows you to browse the images differently. (I picked the middle one as I didn't have to see a lot of images at once and I could just click next to go through them) 




 The way things looks, it reminds me of Yodabashi Camera in Akihabara which (at least for the one I know about) is a HUGE electronics and hobby store that even has its own food court. 




 If you want the OST right now it is $15.99 on the US iTunes store. [Here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/clannad-original-soundtrack/id823583025) is a link that will launch iTunes and bring up the album for you to look at. 




 There will also be a physical version if it reaches the $140,000 stretch goal. 




 The entire OP is pretty good and it is EIGHT minutes long. The song is spread into parts that talk about the chapters in the manga that the season covers. 




 If you ever go to Engladn, never call it a fanny pack. Fanny means something else over there and it is not appropriate... 




 To me in 2009: "Invest in Bitcoin and wait for it to hit $1000 a coin before cashing out." 




 They are localized, if you want it on the PC. 




 **WARNING: Major spoilers in the bottom on the article!** 




 It is delayed on Crunchyroll too. [Here is the link to the episode](http://www.crunchyroll.com/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace/episode-5-661603) and it says ~2 days.

 If you want brawling at a supermarket go watch "Ben-To". 




 It could be one of the two OVAs that were recently announced for all we know. 




 It also seems as though the student council president has an inkling that Souji is TailRed, but dismissed the thought. Odds are it will be brought up next episode with her joining the team as TailYellow. 




 A pair of good headphones. I used to use Bose, then I switched to the Audio Technica ATH-M50's then after a few years I got the Sennheiser HD650 and I can never go back to my old headphones.  




 Probably people who create a new account to spam their sites in order to garner views. 

Last time it happened, the admins quickly shadowbanned them.  




 Reddit has helped me earn ~$1200 over three or so years.

It was mainly through /r/beermoney introducing me to Amazon's Mechanical Turk. It has allowed me to earn some money in my spare time which has allowed me to buy things without paying anything out of pocket. 




 Pretty much any parody anime comes to mind.

* Seitokai no Ichizon
* Hayate no Gotoku
* Lucky Star
 




 No need for the "Life Note". In the original one-shot for Death Note, if you erased the name before the body was destroyed they would come back to life. 




 Then erase the names so they get back to work.  




 You may want to provide a list of sorts such that people don't recommend things you have already seen. 




 Heck, there were Pulp Fiction characters in the fourth episode of KLK. 




 The anime, which uses the same pencil-esque artstyle of the game, is really good. [Here](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5507/Senjou_no_Valkyria:_Gallian_Chronicles) is the myanimelist listing about it. 




 * Sakurasou - Eh...
* Toradora - Not until later in the season
* Kokoro Connect - This fits.
* Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - She is. He has no idea.
* Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - Doesn't fit what OP is looking for
* Kaichou wa Maid-sama - The lead MC is too tsundere and doesn't fit what OP is looking for.  




 Try [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2)! Do not watch White Album for it is a different series and it is really bad. WA2 is an excellent romance anime that definitely goes places.
