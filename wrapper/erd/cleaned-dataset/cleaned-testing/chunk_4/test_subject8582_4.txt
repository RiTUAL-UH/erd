 I think I'm actually as religious as I am due in part Evangelion. I was pretty passively religious when I started, being a teenage child of a Christian family. I watched the first four episodes and my only thoughts on the religious imagery were "Oh, it's kind of like if Gundam let Jesus into its heart. I bet we're in for some edgy but ultimately meaningless symbolism." I came out of it still kind of believing that, but it was mostly silenced by something along the lines of **"WHAT IN THE EVERLOVING CRUCIFUCK DID I JUST WATCH"**. Then after the required analyses of the show and its symbols, I started to gain a deep appreciation for not just the religious aspects of Eva, but of Christian lore.

 I was seven when it first came out. I started watching at like 12 and then again last year.  




 Gamera wasn't Toho, though they did make the '90s movies. 

Anyway, I think after Rodan, Toho started to focus more on Godzilla again. Once King Kong vs Godzilla came out, there wasn't much time for a new Rodan movie because he was in the one after that. The only reason Mothra got her own trilogy is because she was so immensely popular, particularly among women, to the point that Toho decided to appeal to that demographic in particular.  




 Considering she's like a goddess and I'm pretty sure immortal, I don't think she'd need a reproductive system.

 The kitty cat hat was the best thing to come out of Rebuild.  




 Ami's "I'm the shit one, I'm alone, wow is me" antics in this episode kind of reminded me of Evangelion. Specifically when Asuka was being mind-raped by Arael and kept opening the doors until she found her mother.  









 I deserve... So much more than this.  




 This Wolf O'Donnel bitch organized a Super Smash Bros tournament in my town the other day. He had the standard tournament rules- set stages, double elimination, no items, etc. He would only make an exception for games he was in. He only plays Diddy Kong, so when no one was looking before his match he would set the banana item spawn to as low as it goes. His idea was that since Diddy Kong's Down+B summons a banana anyway, no one would notice the subtle extra banana that would spawn. It didn't even affect his games, he just gets off to the knowledge that he did what he did.

 Anything other than an Evangelion is going to have a bitch of a time trying to tear down even the weakest of A.T. Fields. Maybe if the Angels were 3 Tabris-es and three of the pilots were teenage boys... 




 1: which has more abilities?

2: Which is the better one for defense?

3: For offense?

4: Both are put to the test: Post-S2 Engine Evangelion Unit-01 (with Shinji) vs Gurren Lagann (With Simon and Kamina). Both are scaled to 80m.  




 I can't tell if I'm more appalled by the content or the shit taste in anime. 

WATCH GURREN LAGANN OR SOMETHING YOU FUCKING WEEBS.  




 Sick day pt 3, to be sure 









 It's happened across several albums, but the worst offender is the Pokemon Diamond and Pearl soundtrack I bought on iTunes. Every song appears twice in the album listing, so whenever I listen to it or search for the included songs I get each one twice. What's going on and how do I make it stop?

 I don't remember if they said the line in the anime but I know in the manga that Ritsuko (and subsequently NERV as a whole) only expects Shinji to get in the fucking robot, nothing more. I think Unit-01 going berserk was part of the plan from the beginning.

 I'd like to point out the frequency with which Mothra kicks Godzilla's ass.  




 Anta Dipshit?! 




 The End of Evangelion.  




 Maybe Sachiel, Gaghiel, or Israfel, but I can't see any other angels that a Kaiju short of magical holy moths defeating. No one is laying a finger on Ramiel for certain.  




 Easily Pokemon. I'm imagining Godzilla and Groudon  throwing down in Saffron City. Scale up some of the bigger pokemon ("Groudon is 13 feet" my ass) and have Kaiju smack down with them. Beautiful.  




 The problem is that most Kaiju are weaker than most of the Angels because of how much fuckery the AT fields create. There's no real way to fit in any Kaiju short of the Mothras or Iris into the story.  




 Please tell me there's more.  




 can you pm me everything? 




 Apparently it was also because Square thought Westerners were too stupid for JRPGs.  




 I think this is player-made.  









 I think Nintendo still believes Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was necessary.  




 Holy Guac this is exactly how I expected the show to end.  




 It doesn't seem like Vernita and the bus driver would be on a first-name basis, considering Nikki gets off the bus on her own unaffected by her mother's knife fight.  




 Did I miss something? Who's Sarah? 




 Local record store. I was able to bootleg-check it before buying it. But as is the nature of these things, you can't count on it.  




 You gotta watch both Kill Bills. Without volume 2, you miss out on some of Tarantino's best work.  









 I tend to distance the author of a given work from its actual content. What the work *is* is all that should matter. I can enjoy the works of Lovecraft even knowing that he was totally racist. I don't need to know the author to enjoy the story, or the music, or whatever.

 That title made me think I was on Buzzfeed for a second.  









 any platformer is better with a controller. 

Racing/driving is better.

Sports games tend to be better with a controller. 

JRPGs (maybe not all, but definitely Pokemon and Final Fantasy VII)

Some third person action games (Dark Souls, Skyrim in thir person with a melee weapon)

Pretty much anything else is better with kb/m 




 Chances are I'm already bored of it.  




 "I love my mom! I love my dad's money!" 




 Hell, they're probably working on it as we speak. 




 A new Jontron has been in the works. Apparently January's didn't get the Jontron seal of approval and he scrapped it.  




 I guarantee the JC2MP guys are going to be working on it within a week of release.  




 I've been making do with FFVII and emulated Pokemon games. It's just not enough anymore.

 Assuming Godzilla's feats are scaled down from 100m (Final Wars) to 2-3m, each Xenojira is about 3% of the original Goji's power. This means that 100 of them will be 300% of Godzilla's destructive power in total (thanks fan calculations). While I admit I've only seen Alien once, the GojiMorph will still be pretty tough to kill. Each individual Godzilla won't do anything to the GojiMorph, so all the Xenojiras (or at least 33) would have to work together. This poses somewhat of a problem, because Godzilla (Showa fuckness notwithstanding) is more of a lone wolf. After Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla (the '70s one), Godzilla only ever teamed up with Mothra in Final Wars (and even that wasn't really Godzilla and Mothra teaming up, that was Mothra coming in to kill Gigan and Keiser Ghidorah, and Godzilla just happened to be there). 

I suppose the Xenojiras have enough resistance and recovery to realize they can't go it alone, and one will eventually realize that organizing into two or three groups to take down the Gojimorph. 

Xenojiras 9/10

 Can we talk about how on point this is? 




 At this point I actually feel like we're pretty much used to it.

 Standard match in Tokyo.  




 *till he closes his eyes for swood 



















 Also, would it fall under the Second Amendment if I kept it in a bunch of milk jugs? 




 A battle of the only two kaiju Godzilla hasn't defeated yet (in the movies). 

Mothra has a twin egg as backup, and if she dies but the larvae win we count it as her win. 

The Mothra is movie Mothra, **NOT** Mothra Leo from the Rebirth of Mothra movies. He is not the same kaiju as Mothra

The battlefield will be Tokyo. Both monsters get a day of prep.  














 Round 1: standard bout. Both have a standard level/chapter of playtime as prep

Round 2: They fight each other's bosses, boss rush style. Who comes out on top?

Round 3: Who can bed more members of the opposite sex in a day? 

Round 4: Follow-up to round 3, who's *better* in bed? 




 I legit want/need to know 









 We were at a local burger place and I was starting to worry, because I know what this little coywolf does in public. But what happened next didn't start with him. Someone a few tables away started having a heart attack. I saw Wolf's eyes light up as he realized that this is what he had been waiting for the entire time. He ran over and ordered a bystander to call 911, checked for a pulse, and gave mouth-to-mouth expertly, as though he ad been professionally certified. It was when he got to chest compressions that the dark truth behind his fucked-up plan was revealed. I only found this out later, but it turns out he actually hangs out at restaurants all over town and waits for people to need CPR. Turns out he actually *tries* to break as many ribs as he can manage while doing the chest compressions. 

The worst part is that because of Good Samaritan laws, nothing he does is *technically* illegal. No one even thinks to try him because he puts on such a good act, consoling their friends or family (if they're present) and most times even checking up on them in the following weeks.  














 After the Yui incident, Gendo knew Shinji would one day have to get in the Evangelion, so he tried to make him less dependent and bitchly by abandoning him. Because Evangelion is Evangelion, however, this only made Shinji a coward with some serious mental problems. 

I just watched TTGL and this thought came into my head.  




 The title? Kill Drill.  









 Standard bout, No prep.  




 (Some Jon Wolf feats can be found at /r/jonwolf and /r/Jakeandamir)

So Jon Wolf, social vigilante, agent of public chaos, and general nuisance, is challenged with defeating Winston Wolf, Marcellus Wallace's problem solver.

 To be more specific, does it for with a vegan *diet*, not so much the moral principles. I can't have animal fats for health reasons and I need to know if honey is still alright.  




 It's a battle of the women (so this Courier is female) who were shot in the head and went on to become heroes. 

In both rounds, the events happen according to the whims of the Courier, meaning that she gets as much time as she wants. However, her opponent also gets that much time. 

Round 1 is a straight-up fight between the Bride and Courier. 

Round 2 has the Courier going up against Malala in a public speaking contest. Winner gets the Nobel Peace Prize.  




 The Bride has been tasked with seducing everyone's hyperactive explosion-loving director. What is the least valuable thing (to him) that could be promised to Bay in order to make him deny her? 




 I'm painting a bookshelf and I want to have a NERV logo. Problem is, I'm a terrible painter. I couldn't find anything by googling. Do you guys know of any way? 




 The complex characters are one of the best parts of Evangelion, but the complexity often gets pushed aside in favor of yaoi and/or Michael bay style action (looking at you, Rebuild). Is there any manga adaptation that stays true to the original without literally being the anime in comic book form? 









 I remember it, it's a chorus vocalizing in the background, I just don't know the name so I can look it up.

King Kong

King Ghidorah
