 I think it depends on where in the US you are.  The British section at one of local grocery stores is great (no haggis though).  It's the only place I can find Salad Cream!
Wonder if they have an American or Canadian section in England?  









 Chicken Spaghetti

5oz spaghetti noodles, dried or 12oz cooked
1 Tbls butter
1 Tbls bacon grease
1 large onion, med diced
1 bell pepper, med diced
10 to 12 med white or crimini mushrooms, sliced thick
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp Worchestershire sauce
2 tsp dark chili powder
1 Tbls all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
3 ripe Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup Chili sauce (not the Asian kind)
3/4 cup half   half or heavy cream
1 Tbls parsley, dried or 2 Tbls, fresh
2 cups diced or shredded cooked chicken, preferably not canned
1/2 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives
2 cups med cheddar cheese (8oz), grated

1. Cook the spaghetti in a large amount of heavily salted water.  Drain. Do not rinse. Set aside.
2. Heat the butter and bacon grease in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook onions, bell pepper and mushrooms until onions are translucent. Add garlic, Worcestershire and chili powder.  Cook for 1 more minute.
3.  Sprinkle in the flour and stir to incorporate well. Let cook for 1 minute stirring constantly to prevent burning the 'roux'.
4. Add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and chili sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, until slightly thickened. 
5. Remove from heat. Stir in half   half, olives, parsley and chicken.  Stir to incorporate well.  Add spaghetti and cheese and toss well. Return pan to med low heat until it bubbles slightly and cheese melts but do not let boil.

This recipe can be made up to step 5 without adding the chicken and cheese then layered and baked casserole style in a greased baking dish at 350F for 25 minutes. Spaghetti, chicken, cheese and repeat but I feel this is unnecessary.  




 Of course you would and probably if she were a real woman! Sick F *K 









 And this is also why a good deal of people that believe this waste the precious time and opportunity they have while alive and couldn't care less about the desecration of the Earth even though the god they supposedly believe in made them the Earth's caretaker.   




 Well you're half way there by recognizing the your anger and the desire to recognize help from your fellow chefs.  Remember, you aren't performing brain surgery and no one will actually die.  Try to be more of a cheerleader than an individual, especially at this stage.  No successful commercial kitchen I know of has ever been run by one person alone. 




 That's what I thought.  I liked to mix a little plain yogurt and honey with a little cinnamon or allspice.    




 At sea! 




 Geoff, exactly what kind of slavery was it? 




 The french bread used for po-boys in New Orleans. Almost impossible to find anywhere else and I've found no recipe that successfully recreates it.  Soft and slightly chewy in the inside and so crackly on the outside you will be brushing crumbs off you no matter how careful you are.  It literally makes the sandwich.  No other bread comes close.  There are only 3 bakeries that make it but the best by far is Leidenheimer Baking Co.   




 What is the dipping sauce? 




 Aunt Tacca's Mock Cheese Souffle

8 slices of reg white bread, decrusted. You can use any other type of bread just make sure it's decrusted.
butter
1 lbs sharp cheddar cheese, finely grated
6 eggs
3 cups milk or half   half
Tabasco and salt to taste

   Butter one side of ea slice of bread and cut ea in 9 squares.  Butter 9x13 pyrex dish.  Put bread in bottom with buttered side up.  Sprinkle cheese on top of bread.  Beat eggs well.  Add milk and Tabasco and salt to taste.  Pour over cheese and bread.  Lightly push everything into the milk mixture so everything in wet.  Let set overnight in the fridge.  Remove and bring to room temp.  Bake at 350F for 45 min. or until lightly brown and bubbly.  
 




 .... its gotta be Frito Pie! 









 You should really try making fresh ricotta.  All you need is whole milk or 1-2% plus some heavy cream, lemon juice and salt and white pepper.  No need to use raw milk as you have to bring it to a low boil anyway.  

I've made mozz before but I found it's not worth it to me because of the necessity of buying citric acid and rennet which I have no other use for and of course all that stretching.  I prefer to by either whole soft mozz or a block of low-moisture mozz but never the shredded stuff because they coat it with a chemical to prevent it from sticking together which effects its melting quality.  

Have fun and post your results!  




 The recipe is pretty self-explanatory but I will provide micro recipes if anyone needs it. 




 You must really, and I mean REALLY like rice! 









 Oops, I meant fettuccine.  




 Mother Teresa is/was no saint or even someone that had what we would think of as a modicum of a moral compass.  She rejoiced in the suffering of her charges and did little to alleviate suffering while rifling billions into the coffers of the bloated Catholic Church all the while enjoying the jet-set status of a billionaire and received firstclass health-care in the states in her final years.  I guess her final suffering was above those that truly could have used compassion.   Hundreds of women suffered needlessly because of Mother Teresa and ironically that is exactly the way she wanted it! Sick!!!! 




 Congratulations to your uncle!  So few people know how hard and prestigious it is to attain a Masterchef certification from the AFC.  Thousands of people graduate from culinary schools such as the CIA, FBI and Le Cordon Blue every year who can't hold a candle to the few hundred chefs that are industry recognized as THE BEST!  

You're are so lucky to get advice from someone so knowledgeable and thank you for passing it along to the average cook!  

I'm curious though, in your family, who was the best or worst cook and did that lead to his culinary inspiration?  




 The fat German was so hungry he almost wolfed down the entire sandwich before stopping to take a picture of it!    




 Yea but can you cook a proper French omelet? 




 Please tell me you also made homemade ricotta too? 




 Well, okay.  If you do it will just about reach mid-calf lol! 




 A bushel is about 8 gallons or anywhere from 32 to 50+ lbs depending on what is being wieghed.  I dig dill.  I even made a "dill dough" once but that's a lot of dill bro!  Did you mean a bunch? 









 Great job!  I'd love to do a prime rib but I can't seem to find one in any of my grocery stores.  Do I have to go to a butcher shop? 




 Very nice! 




 I only got the one plate at a garage sale but I had to have it! 




 Here ya go!  Sorry, I got sidetracked.

Rice Krispie   Peanut Butter Cup Brownies

Yield: 18 to 24 brownies

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 3 hours
Ingredients:
For Brownie Base:

    3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
    1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
    1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
    1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
    1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder or 2 tablespoons brewed coffee (optional)
    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    3 large eggs
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    8 full-sized peanut butter cups, chopped, or 1 cup mini peanut butter cups

For Crispie Topping:

    1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
    1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter
    1 tablespoon butter
    1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal

Directions:

    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; spray lightly with cooking spray.
    Combine butter and 3/4 cup chocolate chips in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 60 to 90 seconds, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds to prevent scorching. When chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, stir in sugar and brown sugar. Batter may seem grainy, that's ok.
    Add the coffee or espresso powder and vanilla extract and stir until smooth.
    Whisk in eggs until incorporated. Sprinkle the flour over top and fold until just combined. Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips then pour batter into prepared pan.
    Bake for about 25 minutes or until brownies are mostly done. Remove from oven and sprinkle chopped peanut butter cups and remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over top, then return to oven and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool.
    Meanwhile, to prepare topping, combine 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, peanut butter, and butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 1 minute, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds, until melted and smooth. Add rice cereal and toss to coat. Spread cereal mixture in a smooth layer on top of brownies, then cover and refrigerate for at least 90 minutes or overnight, or until topping is cooled and set before slicing and serving. Brownies will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for up to 1 week.

 









 A honey sriracha dressing.  




 Hard to see but the bun was lightly toasted, dawg. 




 Your doing it wrong!!  Hamberogology dictates that the greens, especially whole lettuce leafs be placed under the burger but above the lower part of the bun called the "heel" in order to catch the juicy drippings but also to lead them away down your hand and elbow, which may result in a juicy, tasty lick-fest but will also prevent the dreaded soggy, soaked bottom bun.  Shredded lettuce is another topic and will be addressed in my next online school of Hamberogology. 




 It just occurred to me that this would be a great name for a Food Truck in a Bark Park LOL  




 Give it a good spicy Thai peanut sauce base, add Asian pickled carrots and red onions then finish with a honey Sriracha dressing along with some  chopped scallions and your on your way my friend ; ) 




 Si 









 Kind of hard when we don't know what you have. 




 nope 




 You are correct! I should have made that distinction. 




 Most Christian thought begins with the ideological framework that this planet was made especially by God just for humans.  Mankind was ultimately God's Special Creation and even after the "Fall" mankind was to have dominion of the Earth until mankind had no more use for it because of the Rapture.  

Atheists, Humanists and some religions understand and accept as fact that the world we live in has produced millions of species of animals and plants, most of which (95%) have become extinct.  They do not subscribe to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of all creation but only a fortunate twig that happened to survive in a fairly recent geological fortunate turn of events on the so-called tree of life.

Some Christians label Atheist as arrogant because they believe Atheist see themselves as some sort of god or above a god.

Atheist, on the other hand, view the Christian view that the world exists just for humans arrogant as well. 

What are some Christian perspectives on this subject?
  

         




 We'd call this a Breakfast Chalupa were I'm from in Texas but close enough Amsterdam!  Looks even better than most served here! 




 Yes, German settlers in the Hill Country in Texas found they could take a tough cut of beef, pound the hell out of it till it begged for Absolution, soak it in a little buttermilk to further tenderize it, then cook it just like a weinerschnitzel! 




 Why can't I find Prime rib in the stores in Texas?  Is it called something else now? 




 Always put lettuce on the bottom! It prevents the juice from the burger from soaking into the "heel" of the bun so the burger won't disintegrate in your hands.  Other than that, great job!   




 I'm getting my aquarium ready just in case!  Probably would add a tiny toy Spock lol! 




 What are they good for?,  absolutely nothing! 

 Well, except they're so cute! 




 Chicken Fried Steak is probably based on the German dish, wienerschnitzel.  Texas has a significant population with German heritage that goes way back.  So much so that German tourists who visit the Hill Country in Texas can't or just barely understand what they are saying.  They also gave us great beer and Kolaches!   




 What, no kippers?  Seriously though, I now have "Breakfast In America" stuck in my head.  Looks great!  




 Those are some sexy brussels sprouts!  The mound of arugula could use a touch of vinaigrette unless it just there to make you think you're eating somewhat healthy *chuckle*    




 Texas, where to begin?  Pecan-encrusted chicken fried steak with poblano creme sauce served with one smoked brisket and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno with a side of fresh salad of Dandelion greens, topped a smattering of no-bean beef chili, roasted corn, avocado chunks and crushed Fritos drizzled with nacho cheese sauce.  




 California is a big state but here goes,  Take Tri-tip braised with Anchor Steam, slice thinly on a bed of Kale and Arugula.  Add marinated artichoke hearts, avocado slices and Sourdough croutons.  Use a Caesar dressing and finish with a fresh California poached chicken egg.    




 Exactly my thought.  This was New Orleans and because they are sue happy I had to pay higher premiums while I was stationed there.  

The worst thing was we both worked in the same building and I had to pass her in the hall wearing her neck brace for a non-injury on my dime!   




 I gotta ask....what are cat head biscuits?
 




 She was deaf and they thought that would be an advantage (sympathy) to her case even though they found no fault.  I still have the letter lol!  At least they didn't raise my rates. 




 What if you have the same insurance company?  Would it really make any difference to them?  Doubt they would sue themselves LOL! and in the end they could pick who they wanted to jack-up the ins policy rate.  




 My insurance company decided to settle when the "victim" threatened a lawsuit even though it was under 5 mph, no damage to either car and she refused medical treatment after requesting an ambulance.  Ask me why.  




 English is a very rich language!  It's why we say we eat beef and pork instead of steer and pig but we say we eat chicken and lamb instead of poultry and baby sheep.  

Basic cooking methods are traditionally divided into two categories, dry heat and moist heat.  Dry heat includes roasting/baking, broiling, pan-frying, saute and deep-fry.  Moist methods include boiling, simmering, poaching, braising, stewing and steaming.  I may have missed a few but it's getting late here.

Souping, currying and gravying are not cooking methods.  You can use varying cooking method to achieve a soup. An example would be braising onions and simmering a veal stock for reduction for a French Onion Soup.  

If I make a soup I may use many techniques but no one would call that "souping"

As for my vegetarian friends.  I sort off appreciate the many ways vegetables have been "disguised" as meat but at the end of the day they aren't and don't have to be cooked the same as "meat".   




 I'll let you know! 




 Was going to make Chicken Spaghetti then I ran across this!  Wondering if I should serve over spaghetti like Cincinnati Chili.     




 Stewing is a style of cooking and not a dish.  A stew is made up of smallish pieces of protein that are first pan-seared then cooked in a liquid much like braising.  The kind of protein, liquid and any additions used are wholly up to the imagination.   




 Ask for "the Animal" 




 Well if you consider Fort Worth close.  It's from Salsa Fuego.  Great burgers and Tex Mex that was rated #5 in the state by "Texas Monthly" 




 Usually made with Parmesan yes?   Molded into cups or bowls.  If you're a true foodie you'd refer it as as a frico.  This however, is something altogether different.  This is cheese love, or cheese chips!   




 The locals lovingly refer to it as "the golden halo". 









 Hats off to Salsa Fuego in Fort Worth for this masterpiece of burgerdome! 




 You shouldn't worry so much about how to pay for college, rather you should be more worried about how to pass your courses. 

 Your English is abysmal.  Look into a remedial class first.  You can take some online for free! 




 Did this all the time as a night baker in the Navy!  When I worked in a Flag Mess sometimes I'd have to go the Navy Exchange as soon as it opened to buy beer for beer cheese soup.  The looks I got! LOL 




 If I had a restaurant I'd give a discount to people for things like having well-behaved children or correcting misbehaving children.  I would also offer a discount for patrons with no children but have had to deal with disruptive kids around them.  If not a discount, at least offer a free dessert.     




 To begin with I'm not convinced that the Exodus ever actually occurred but that has no bearing whatsoever on my conclusions.  The lineage of the Jewish people is not based in Egypt.  

Your assertion that most Jews in Israel aren't really Jewish is false.  Anyone today, for as little as a $100 DNA test, can trace their ancestry back to a specific geographical location all over the world.  Interestingly Arabs and Jews have a very close DNA indicating they are from the same stock.

Anywho... your comment about the Jewishness of the Jews in Israel has absolutely no bearing on your assertion of the supposed benevolent principles of Jewish Law and subsequent "tweaking" by Jesus of traditional Hebrew laws.           




 "All jewish law is derived from the principles of loving god and loving your neighbor."  I'm throwing down the BS card.

Your statement is about half right.  The Hebrews of the OT may have loved their god but they and their god certainly didn't love their neighbors especially when it was inconvenient for them.  

The majority of Christians are unaware of the atrocities committed by Hebrews (god commanded it or was committed by their god alone) because their Christian education consisted of simplistic Christian children's books, children's bible studies or what their family told them but have never actually read a bible.  Most Christians are woefully ignorant of what the bible actually says and instead of actually reading it they depend on some so-called "expert" such as a preacher, priest or minister to read it and then explain and "interpret" it to them.  

The "golden rule" factor was not and is not a part of the Hebrew faith.  

Case in point, look at what they are doing now. the Christian political dupes who just want to hold onto what political power they have cow-towed to the demands of AIPAC that holds way to much political influence already.   




 Homo Erectus, wasn't that the title for a gay porn film? 




 Plus it's a school for non-English speakers where homophones are one of the most difficult but an important part of the English language to grasp. 




 Some psychotic people and some animals may lack morality (amoral) but all humans have an innate sense of right and wrong, that is they know it's bad to crap in the bathtub of the world even if it benefits them (which it doesn't because it's their bathtub too).  They are moral if they don't act on this awareness and are immoral if they are aware but do anyway. (no pun intended)

Amoral doesn''t equal immoral so I think your kids are safe. 




 I've asked this too and usually received a reply along the lines of the "Golden Rule" but like you said that rule is mostly culturally and religiously universal but is still not even fully adhered to in the bible.  I've never received a well-defined answer to this question and probably never will.     




 You are why I believe religion has a place in society even though I myself have no belief in eternal damnation.  Personally, people like you scare me. 




 These so-called "family friendly" hypocrites force their employees to sign a document that essentially negates their federally afforded and constitutional protections from discrimination in order to be employed.  Republicans will say that they have the choice to sign and work for HL or go someplace else but this is more common than you think and will most certainly and exponentially grow and when you're desperate for a job to feed your family you shouldn't have to worry about signing away your civil rights for a job.  HL and companies like them should not be allowed to violate federal laws that protect citizens from discrimination.   These "contracts" must be outlawed as a condition of any employment.    




 Most certainly he will cling to his Christianity more strongly than ever since his religion promises him a ticket to heaven if he sincerely repents and accepts Jesus as his savior.  Meanwhile non-Christians, some of whom never even heard of Jesus or didn't hurt anyone will burn in hell forever simply because they never acknowledged him.  This god/Jesus person sounds like a narcissistic sociopath, IMO, who only cares whether humanity praises him.  

This really is the opposite of a true love that seeks no compensation or pay off.  Why would a perfect god need validation or admiration from it's creation?         




 I'm going to culinary school.  Last week we were told we don't actually fry eggs.  What we are actually doing is sauteing an egg.  Then we actually deep fried a whole egg and the result was interesting.  I took this one step further by just deep-frying an egg yolk.  Eureka!  It held it shape, can be handled and looks nice.   




 I'm so ready to try using my waffle iron for hashbrowns. I think it would work better than a panini press.  




 You have been bought up in a faith and you believe in it hook, line, and sinker because it's what you know and what they told you to believe.  The same happens to all kids in the middle east.  ????????????????  




 "False, everyone knows God exists, and comes to this conclusion naturally"

Calling the BS flag here. The thing is, if this were even remotely true, you have to be able define the attributes of your particular god before you can have a belief and babies/children do not come by this naturally.  

"The message is restricted because God only plans to save some people."

Your response shows exactly why the OP posted his question.  Your response indicates that your god is only interested in his "chosen people" and doesn't care about other people he had created. From what his "chosen people" have told me they don't want this.

"Allowing sinful creatures to be born so they could be punished is not in itself evil unless you want to argue that justice is evil."

It could be said that your argument justifies the abuse and punishment of every child born.  According to you there is not one innocent baby born.  Obviously you are not a parent and I hope that you never become one. 




 God supposedly created all things including good and evil.....on purpose. 




 Your first statement is completely presumptive.  No one is born knowing a god or gods exist.  They only know what they are exposed to and learn what is expected of them from their culture.  Additionally, no one that "knows" a god exists and understands the consequences would willfully disobey a commandment of a god because of abject fear, unless they were mentally ill but that's another issue. 

Your second premise, that a god is not unjust in not revealing its' nature and expectations to all of humankind because it doesn't owe it to them, doesn't make any sense especially if that god is omnipotent.  Why would the "message" be restricted to only a tiny part of humanity especially if that was the means to salvation?  Why were there "chosen people" in the first place? 

The fact that the early origins of all religions were restricted to isolated groups indicates, not an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent god/gods, but only a belief system or mythology based on the actual living conditions of the group at that time.  
 




 Did you realize that you are the 666 commenter? lol 




 Most of my clients have dog doors leading to their back yards.  Some can walk their dogs but can't drive to a store as is the case with my blind client. 




 Who are you to say they "shouldn't" have a pet.  Often that is the only companion they have on a daily basis because they are home-bound.  

You seem to have a lack of empathy coupled with an extremely  judgmental attitude about people and situations you know nothing about. 




 By mobility I mean not being able to get to a store.  Many are home-bound because they can't drive anymore but can still get around their house.  Meals on Wheels has enabled many seniors from having to move into a nursing home.  One of my clients is a young woman who is blind and another man was only 29 years old but enrolled in MOW temporarily after a leg injury left him unable to go down two flights of stairs.  




 You were right in the beginning,  that is a horrible thing to say.  FYI, client's services in Meals on Wheels are not based on income.  It's about mobility.  A lot of my clients pay money to MOW but they aren't required to.    




 I have a pet route along with my regular Meals on Wheels route.  I deliver pet food just once a month.  My regular route is only one day a week.  Both routes take only 1 1/2 hours at most.  I have become very close with most of my "clients" including the furry ones and it is one of the most rewarding things I do all week.  

If you can spare just 1 hour one day a week please consider becoming a Meals on Wheels volunteer.  They always need more volunteers!  




 It's the day before that blows! 




 Everyone's reactions are different.  A lot depends on emotional support or rejection from your partner, friends and family, the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy or any prior history of mental health problems.  

There are no scientifically valid studies that support the conclusion that the procedure itself causes any problems. 




 It was in the 80's, around $400.   




 Common arguments include the mother having regrets leading to severe depression and/or suicide.  Medical issues may include the inability to have children later or develop breast cancer.

 Having an abortion.  Not exactly a walk in the park but no latent physical or mental problems afterward. 




 I would agree except I always worry about bacteria growth from the grinding process.  I much prefer Beef Carpaccio.  




 I am trying to imagine the Jesus of Nazareth telling a starving person that feeding them wouldn't help others in the long run.  

Then again, according to Catholic doctrine, life on this earth is inconsequential and the only import is life after death(oxymoron) and the best way to get a good death/life is to suffer as Jesus did. 

So the masses are told to suffer while the priests live this life high on the hog.

Explain again why we, the masses, are skeptical of the motivations of a religious organization that has its own bank, government and voice at the UN that no other religion has?      




 Most "rednecks" make sure their kids get vaccines.  I should now as I proudly is one lol.  Seriously though most deniers are either immigrants or overly-educated, upper middle-class people who think they are smarter then the rest of society.   




 To let everyone know I'm an atheist.  I'll tell people if asked but I won't in anyway advertise it.  I'd like to wear the "A" on a necklace or put a sticker on my car but I'm afraid of vandalism or negative repercussions from my instructors and employers.    




 Glad to hear that he's your ex.  My question to you and one that you should consider very carefully is why you chose to ignore his rude remarks to you and women in general.  Why did you put up with his shit for a fraction of a second?  

You stuck up for your friend but not yourself?  Why?  You obviously knew that he was a a misogynist before hand yet stayed with him.  Are the "positive attributes" that good that you would put up with his crap?

Listen, I had a boyfriend that stood to inherit a 20 million dollar fortune which I didn't find out for a long time.  He was a drunk and and even his mother wanted me to marry him but after he tried straggling me in a drunken rage I fought back the way my mother taught me to.  I put my hat on and left.  Nothing is worth losing your own dignity.  You're better off and I hope you find your self-worth! 




 Considering the amount of plastic surgery that's done for no other reason then "enhancement" I have to disagree that mutilation of the body is only a primitive endeavor. Starving and binging in order to achieve a body style is as bad as foot binding and is done for the same reasons. 




 Nah, she just sort of gave up and had no interest in anything.  I guess you could say it was the "fuck it, I don't want live any longer" diet.  Not recommended for anyone just wishing to just lose a few pounds. 




 My "selfish cunt" of a grandmother went from 250 lbs to 74 lbs in 2 years before she died.  You're welcome you asshole! 




 Not quite, our coffins have longhorns on the front. 




 toilet paper! 




 I think that Mark Twain summed this up in his essay about the arrogance of humans in thinking they are more "successful" than clams or bacteria.

Lower and higher forms of life is purely a subjective point of view.  If twenty thousand generations of my relatives have lived and died in your gut since your birth and, at any one time, more of my kind reside there then all the humans that are living and have ever died, I'd have to declare victory.

Who knows?  Maybe God has a hard on for bacteria and beetles and humans were an afterthought.    




 Unfortunately my mother embraced this idea in her later life. Her mistake was not caring of others opinions vs. caring about others feelings.  She came to the mistaken belief that she was now "entitled" to treat anyone like crap because she was old. She died without any close friends.  Most of her family had limited contact and those that were there put up with it for money.  Sad
