 This is nice.

Just threw something together. 

I'm guessing no? 




 Exactly. 




 In regards to the racist and/or offensive names, I think that is something that should be taken care of in a way other than random names. 

Since joining, I've thought that there needed to be a tighter filter on names (both group and personal). Hopefully we can see this some day. Not everyone is all about the vile *grossness* that comes along with with "HairySpankyPeen69" and "D1ldoButtLuv". 




 Woet pls 




 I know it's not the biggest deal in the world, but when someone makes a group and then invites his buddies, no one is able to see the creative name he came up with.

Many times have I created a group making fun of a friend I was inviting to play. Much to my chagrin, they never take notice of my cleverness.

Anyways...I think it'd be reasonable to have the group name translate to the actual group itself. 




 It's been a long time since we've discussed this, and I just got done listening to the entire 4 hour 30 minute FFX soundtrack. So, I was naturally intrigued.

1. Which is your favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack and why? 

1. What is your favorite Final Fantasy song and why?

**EDIT:** You glorious people have just given me a months worth of songs to listen to. I love you all! 




 I hope it was clear that I'm not trying to provide extensive and detailed strategies; rather, I am trying to offer some very generalized and beginners advice from (limited) experience. Seems like you guys are talking specifics, which could confuse a beginner all the more.

Defense is a humble position to play in TagPro. If you do your job well your team and/or the scoreboard might not recognize your brilliance. If you do your job poorly everyone knows (including the scoreboard), and your teammates might start a subreddit about how bad you are (i.e. /r/staertheslippyball). There are some incredible in-depth guides for defensive players that want to improve their skills, most notably are [Felix's Guide to Defense Part 1](http://redd.it/1njysa) and [Part 2](http://redd.it/1rre1k), and [Hob's Guide to Containment Defense](http://redd.it/1uohk0). However, if you would like to follow some simple introductory steps to playing defense in TagPro, hopefully this quick guide can help!

###The Five P's of TagPro Defense

1. **PURPOSE** - Discover your purpose as a defender. Typically, there are two players on defense and two on offense. Along with your defensive partner, your primary purpose is to defend your flag, disallowing the opposing team from leaving your base with said flag. Notice that I didn't say that your primary purpose is to refuse access to your flag at all times. Sometimes the best option is to allow enemies to momentarily take your flag so you can swiftly pop them back to their base. If they escape your base with the flag, it is your responsibility to chase after them until they are popped and your flag is back safely at home. There are certainly secondary and tertiary purposes of the defensive position, but as long as you are committed to keeping and returning your flag back to base, you are rolling in the right direction.

1. **PROTECT** - ...your flag: As previously stated, your primary purpose is to guard your flag. The only way the opposing team can score is if they grab hold of and escape with your flag. 

   ...your base: Know when to hold a button and when to let it go. Decide to clear speed pads every 10 seconds or know how they can be used against you and instead use them to your advantage. Bombs are typically not a defender's friend; eliminate them as soon as they spawn (as long as it is safe to do so). Take care of your base so an attacker doesn't use it to take care of you!

   ...your power-ups: As a defender, the main power-up that is useful is Tag Pro. However, it is nice and wise to offer power-ups to your attackers, as it could benefit them most. You want your team to get the power-ups, not the other team. So if necessary, don't hesitate to take a power-up and use it defensively.

   ...your teammate with the flag: This gets tricky and is a little more advanced because you might mess it up and be the reason why your teammate gets popped and the flag returned. But if possible, push enemies away from your flag carrier so that he or she can score.

1. **POSITION** - Sometimes you will want to hover on top of the flag to prevent an opponent from picking up the flag. Most of the time you will want to stay a tile or two away (usually on the opposite side of your opponent) so you can quickly pop them if they perform a "flaccid grab" (grabbing the flag without a real chance of escape, resulting in a pop). If they grab the flag and continue to roll towards you, there is very little you have to do to pop them. If they grab and then roll away, you will have more momentum than they do, allowing you to quickly catch them. Furthermore, you want to zone defend certain "chokepoints" that serve as entry or exit points into and out of your base. Positioning varies map to map and is largely dependent on the skill level of your enemies and your teammates. 

1. **PATIENCE** - Getting juked is the worst. It is also, at times, inevitable. But you can do some practical things to help prevent breaking your ankles on a regular basis. It is often smart to let the opposing flag carrier come to you. Be patient and let them make the first mistake. Remember, they know where they are going, you don't. Refuse to over-commit. If you have to chase, do so with reservation. Drink Felix's advice like a soothing miracle tonic: 

   *The best way to chase is to go where they are going, not where they are.*

1. **PRACTICE** - Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make you better. Practice  fail  learn  make changes  improve. PUBs (public games) can improve your play, but it is difficult to play adequate defense if your defensive partner is subpar. PUGs (pick-up games) usually host better and more experienced players. I'm not suggesting that you jump into PUGs right away, but do aspire to grow in your skills and aim to take part in PUGs sooner rather than later. 


I hope the Five P's have been advantageous to your progression as a TagPro defender. Now, go forth and defend your flag you impenetrable wall you. 




 Are you home yet? 




 This is wonderful /u/AMorpork. Thanks for doing this. 




 Do dolphins really gang-rape humans? 




 So here's my orderly tactic: 

# Turn screen so passersby cannot see. 
# Turn volume low and mask by background music.
# Act like I am not in the office if anyone calls. 
# Refuse to go to staff meeting or any meeting for that matter. 
# Treat my coworkers like scum because anytime they come into my office they are taking away from valuable time that I could be investing into TagPro. 
# Quit my job as soon as my boss tries to ask me what I'm doing. Like it's any of his business... 
# Pack up office and leave because I was fired before quitting. 
# Return to office late into the night and set whole building on fire. 
# Don't take another job because, frankly, I don't have time. TagPro.  




 Do you play while at work/school? How do you do it without getting caught? If someone walks in, what do you do? HELP ME I'M AT WORK! 




 "Ooo two defenders. Uh oh, another spawning. Great patience. Oh! Oh! Juked! Oh! Double juke! Triple juke! And he's freeeeeee--" 

*Boom! Pop!*

"...Dude..."

Thoughts? Suggestions? 




 What's the story behind this? 




 Upvoting just so we can get to the bottom of this. Spent the whole night listening to a PUG group discuss the bot's tactics and stats. Ready to unplug the bot and move on.  




 I look on Craigslist until my eyes grow sore. Luckily, I am an hour away from a military base where men and women are leaving at a moments notice and need to sell a car. That is often how I get them so cheap.

Just look for a deal and wait patiently for a deal and a deal will present itself! 




 If you are patient and refuse to get "car fever", then you can find an incredible steal of a deal for $5,000.

I recently purchased a 2003 Toyota Camry in great condition, one owner, and 105k miles for $4,000. You can do the same. 




 Just want to mention that /u/JuventinoSenator (Liquid) did an incredible job of hosting Maptesting Monday. He was very professional, organized, and friendly to all that wanted to get involved. 

+10 friends points for being such a cool guy. 




 I can't tell if this is April Fools or real life...

My eyes are running. I no like... 




 Still, even if he was breaking the law in that manner, I don't know if it is justifiable that they would taser him in such a way. I hope that I don't ever get tasered for speeding or jaywalking. That'd just be terrible. 




 Bad video quality I know, but you can clearly hear the entire transaction. 









 Not sure about this one. It is a fun concept, but it came up about five times for me today and it gets old pretty quickly. 




 But have you ever played with squares? 




 This is wonderful. You should have ended it without the escape. It would have been funnier to imagine that the poor square never made it out alive. 




 Thank you for getting on this so quickly, Lucky. The bug had me right pissed off. This isn't some 90 degree bullsheesh. This is TagPro. We're freakin' balls.  




 I'm fine with this. We must remember that they are not working on a game for only a year. They are working on a game for 2+ years before release. 




  I personally would like to see it as an easter egg...

I think this would be a good idea. I enjoy the map and gameplay, but as many have already said, it is a different game type altogether. It is a fun gimmick map, not a regular rotation competitive game. 




 Not sure if you meant that or the opposite. But, I am currently investing 15% of my monthly income into retirement.  




 Great comments here. Let me try to address them as asked:

* I do not have cable or a home telephone. Internet is cheapest I can get. Cell phone could probably go down $15 or so which does add up. 
* I just refreshed my auto insurance so, as far as I can tell, I have the lowest rate available.
* I don't even recall giving them an average mileage. I'd have to look that up somewhere. 




 I would suggest maybe reevaluating how much you're wanting to spend on the house. I'm not sure if $250,000 would be a comfortable purchase for me if I was making less than $30k/year, although I do understand the roommate thing would help. What if you can only get two? What if one stops paying rent because of a job loss? What if you can't get someone to fill an empty room? It sounds like a lot of risk to me.

If I were you, I'd probably consider looking for a less expensive house or even rent for the time being. 




 Interest rate is at an even 5%. 




 I've had a townhouse for four years now. I would like to pay off my mortgage as soon as possible. I have an emergency fund, I am investing a percentage into retirements, and I have no debt.

I have been paying an additional $150 towards principal each month, but that isn't moving the needle quick enough.

I moved through these other financial steps quickly. Now I feel like I am stuck. What are some practical things I could do to help pay off my mortgage as soon as possible? 




 I feel like you aren't sure whether or not to apologize.

"I'm sorry...but it's really your fault. I love you guys...but you gotta stop being butthurt. J/k, It's all my fault, please forgive me. Jerks."

 Thank God, I've needed to blame somebody else.

/u/Tim-Sanchez and /u/remiel - sit back, I've got a list:

* My internet is slow. Please make it faster.
* I lose way too much. Please make me better.
* I get idiots on my team. Please ban them. 
* Sometimes people downvote me on Reddit. Please stop them.
* My wife gets angry at me sometimes for playing too much. Please quell her.
* My rabbit regularly chews furniture she is not supposed to. Please pop her cute little nose.
* My car runs out of a gas every single week. Please fill it up.
* I'm ugly. Pls...

 What do coaches look at? What do you look at to determine if a player is quality or not? What specific stats are you looking at when you look? Just curious. Any input would help. 




 If this is a real request, then absolutely.  




 Late incoming, so I don't know if I'll get much feedback. But here are two outfits from this week:
