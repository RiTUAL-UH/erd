 Fucking asshole, THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT RICK HAS BEEN THROUGH. IT TAKES SOMETHING FUCKING HUGE TO SUPRISE THIS MAN WHO HAS LOST AND GAINED SO MUCH.  




 CONSTABLE RICK GRIMES. 




 Rick expected it. He knew that either carl or daryl needed some "fresh air" at some point.  




 Rick is outside so he could get the gun that he concealed, and he doesn't care if carl gets out because he knows that carl can take care of himself especially with rick close by.  




 Churchin' it up 




 Are you from salem? Do you happen to be a witch?

 Cats  




 Protecting the lady from her stalker with a handgun. Fuck yeah. Total win. 




 Shut up man, im trying to be sad :c 




 Haha your right about that my friend,  people come here from Mexico thinking its the promised land. Little do they know. 




 So why are you talking shit to me? We have the same thinking pertaining to our government.  We're fighting the same fight, just different tactics. 




 You love this shitty country? This country that kills its innocent civilians? Im not saying i give up, im just pointing out that our 'privacy' has been in the government's hands before any of us even thought that our precious country would do such a thing. This "country" for a lack of a better word is too far gone. I care about myself and whats going to happen to me in these dark dark days, im not rolling over and dying im just pointing out the obvious. 
 




 /r/wincest (   ) sorry, it is a curse... 




 Great please do. You not voicing your opinion or rather not even commenting will do this subreddit a huuuge favor. 




 How the fuck? Its the truth, i gave an answer that is logical yet you think im trying to throw you off, im not the bad guy you prick.  




 Everyones data in America has been seen. Everyone's. No one has private shit my friend we're all out in the open.  




 Those devices are License Plate readers so repo companys can get the car that they are trying to locate. Not everything is a conspiracy lol.
