 Helps a lot actually, especially with your username. Live long 




 Thanks for the reply! I started feeling like I do around 7 or 8 so I totally get you.  




 I had friends who had to ask me if it was ok to laugh when i told them. When all that's left is absurdity, enjoy it. 




 You're doctor is the only one who can tell you that. Just remember that there is no magic bullet with mental health. You're going to have good days and bad. Hopefully, by working through the process, the good will eventually outweigh the bad.  




 I really connected with that, a lot of similarities with me as well.  




 It helps a bit yes. I have lonliness and abandonment issues so talking to people helps.  




 Good on you fundamentally misunderstanding a disease  




 Nope, bipolar means you have up periods. I don't 




 This has brightened my day but no my very serious medical condition has not disappeared.  




 The brain is a crazy thing, so it is actually possible. Not saying it's gospel, some therapy isn't as good as others, you just gotta find what's right for you.  




 Ahh, gotcha. My bad.  




 A double horseshoe? 




 And to you. Remember, these are just my experiences, so don't necessarily self diagnose. If you think there's an issue that needs help, I strongly recommend seeing a counselor of some sort.  




 Same here, feel free to pm any time. Thanks! 




 Appreciate that, though being honest I didn't realize it, and when I did, I did do a Karma whore post.  




 Could very well be a major factor. I haven't ever eaten healthy, even when I dropped weight.  




 I can't diagnose you. If you think you might, see a professional for diagnosis/treatment. It's not anything to wait around on.  




 I have two hands.  




 It's what I've been used to for about 13 years now, don't know much else on the emotional spectrum.  




 If you ever feel like you might have any kind of mental disorder; constant sadness, extreme apathy, hearing voices, loss of time, seek a professional counselor for diagnosis.  




 Feel better now?

 I have a friend who's done that and it seemed to help him. I need to research more but I'm not at all opposed.  




 I know, it's something I'm trying to do but it's damn hard at times.  




 It's not overly common and is an explanation as to why standard treatments weren't helping.  




 Some days are easier than others but when it comes down to it, I got out of bed today because of what might come tomorrow.  




 You are most welcome. Most of my collegiate career has been such bullshit I delight in making sure others arent going through the same.  




 Many thanks. Seem to be a stream of people who didn't like this post looking to kill it. But jokes on them, I made the front page, I can live without the karma.  




 I work the graveyard at a call center which is DEAD on weekends so it's been helping me stay awake actually, but I'm happy if it helped at all.  




 Considering I paid a whopping total of 16 dollars to my psychiatrist, probably not.  




 Much appreciated. 

Medication can be a bitch and a half, kudos to you for stubborning your way past when it stopped being effective. 

Relationships take a lot of time and patience, even more so when you have depression, but you'll get there.  




 Listen to Patton Oswalt and eat a tube of circus peanuts knowingly. I must prepare.  




 It will. It can always get better. God I hate saying something this cliche, but it always gets darkest before dawn, (I know, I hate me too) but the fact that you can see yourself happy is a good thing. If you can see it, it's possible. For a long time I couldn't even see myself happy.  




 Not exactly what it is, but this is a true statement.  




 Yeah, it's mostly about getting better for me. Honestly just the name made me laugh when I heard it and has been an interesting conversation piece, which is why I did this.  




 It seems to be fairly new from the other comments.  




 Sounds pretty similar, except I don't have the up days, I'm always on the lower side of things.  




 I'm trying to get into meditation, but my mind races a bit to fast and i havent figured out how to calm it just yet. 

I've never taken any illegal substances, and that's all I will say about that.  




 Is that a Breaking Bad reference I'm not getting? 




 One of my close friends was diagnosed bi polar, so we have that connection that has really helped us both through some tough times.  




 No worries, at my worst I wouldn't wish what I was going through on anyone. Reddit actually helped me a lot in showing me that I'm not alone. If you ever need an ear, we're always around.  




 Very nice. I have to loose weight and exercise releases positive endorphins that can really help with depression so I'm trying to get into the habit, it's just breaking through the apathy. Thanks for the well wishes! 




 You as well. I find it kind of fascinating how little we really know about depression and the human brain, like which meds work with who and why.
