 so with the arrival of new devourer i was wondering some new team comps. I believe that some of you would already have seen, although i am in bronze i feel i can talk about this. 
 Udyr, ezreal, nautilus, caitlyn, Gnar. 
so my reasoning for this is because you can have well poke and good CC at the same time. in a team fight you can easily single target people with either Udyr or Naut. on top of all that you could poke out the enemy team or zone out carries with ez cait and gnar(mini). this team i also feel would work situationally because you would have gnar for backline CC and multi target stuns and knockbacks for a good ez ult followed by multi knockup from naut. Devour would play a huge role here depending on udyr path whether it was tiger or phoenix. phoenix would be great aoe because you could multi flame, and tiger would be good for single target kills on carries. 
so this post was for my idea for some good team comps i wouldnt mind seeing some more be posted whether they are viable or not. 




 well im glad that im noticed in that regard but as you can tell the game was a loss i have alot of improving to do before i can even consider my self good. 




 thank you i love how you put chess in there it really puts it more in perspective for me with that analogy. i will be sure to take all of this information to heart thank you so much.
