 I feel you - that was tough to get through...still think the ending makes all of that worth it though. And to be honest, I felt like Shun's suicide was sadder than Maria and Mamoru leaving... 




 I find this hard to accept - I've never failed a test in my life. 




 I had enough time to study on the train commute thank goodness! I'm probably the worst procrastinator I know. :/ 




 I can't decide if this sounds like a good idea or a bad idea.
