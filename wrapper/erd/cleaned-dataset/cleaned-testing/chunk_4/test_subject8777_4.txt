 i dont know how i feel about this.. 




 I'd hide too 




 or gas 




 this is nothing new.. 




 Yes, the quotes are suppose to alternate. Being married to an english school teacher and having her looking over my shoulder right now, we can tell you with certainty that you made a bad decision. 




 and cheeseburgers apparently. 




 But remeber how to box step 




 its SNL..why would I be surprised.. 




 this is sad 




 there seems to be a lot of whoring going on lately 




 Single? 




 Looks like someone could not come up with a gift idea in time.. 




 i have friends too and we take pictures

 use your own body weight as resistance first and go from there...simple push ups and pull ups are a great place to start 




 No porn...ur a rockstar 




 it is 









 who the fuck is Macklemore? 
























 I live in San Diego, Ca 



















 I totally understand the whole money thing...studios tend to take advantage of pple who are new to the recording game and to be honest you could have gotten the same sound prolly for free from some recording arts student who is looking for bands to track...i recorded some awesome bands while i was in school using that method and you would be surprised how much cooler pple are when there is no money involved! Im a 26yr old audio engineer with some good vision. Id love to mix your track if you have the ability to get the session file or at least the individual tracks. I do alot of mixing at my studio at home and would love to toy around with some different stuff if youre into it. Not looking to get paid, bt if the mix comes out well, id love to be able to use it on my audio resume...let me know what you are thinking and also with your vocals being out of key, that is a relatively easy fix for me with some of the programs i use...let me know..message me back on here and we can figure it all out! My name is alex btw 




 I have not no..but I will definitely check them out now! You a fan?

 hey man! glad that you got a recording done in a studio! Such a good feeling! its a good track, but it sounds like the guitars are really compressed hard, especially during the distortion parts..it sounds like it is just slammed and really sucks the life out of the guitar tracks...the vocals are also very very in front of the mix, which i guess is good in some instances but it could prolly be mixed back a bit because the singer tends to stress some of his vocals at times. other than that it sounds good and keep rocking! 
























 This is not wtf material... :( 




 beth? 




 That is an awesome painting! I want that for my album artwork for the band! 




 Keep doing your thing Nate! Looks great and can only get better from here! Interested at all in doing some album artwork!? 














 This is old news...
 



















 Ahhhhhhhh the cuddle fish, I'm sooo sawee Kyle! 




 Unfortunately tho bro..justin machado took that photo of me yesterday and i went out with him and 4 other close friends as his family is good family friends from high school bc he was my teacher...so i was with someone who knows what they are doing and was giving me great advice... the broken board was my own doing...ive grown up around surfing, seen it everyday in the water while i was on a sponge and have been in the water probably more in my life than on land... so i am not charging out on big waves not knowing what i am doing...i am riding waist high white wash trying to understand the feeling and mechanics of the board under my feet before taking it to an area full of surfers...being a sponger i know how surfers view someone who doesnt know what they are doing so i am not being irresponsible by just charging out like it is no thing...having lost people to the water, i understand it is not something to be taken lightly so please do not assume you know how I am approaching this because everything I do is always very calculated..

And stop using the word Kook, its unbecoming...  




 Hah oh yess know god speed for sure just never seen it written like that :)
 




 No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :) 




 No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :) 




 Yea it is all instrumental music! We want to leave it up to the listener to make what they want of it :) 




 Hahaha ur right bro. What was I thinking...And learning on white wash u are right, Im so in your way and complete nuisance. It's all good, i don't set foot in PB, so you can claim that for yourself..I'll take a break at wind n sea, table tops, boneyards, hell even beacons or any other break in NC over PB any day so that's all yours man..

If your worried about a "kook" stealing ur wave, don't trip. I have lived here my whole life and have been in the water for most of it just not surfing, so I know my etiquette. But I will say out of everyone I've talked to about this learning experience, you sir have been the biggest Richard of them all, so I say good day to you 




 If you think I'm a hipster with the pbr comment...you are way way off base my friend...i forgot tho that you came out of your moms vagina on a Steve Lis and never were a kook...I hope you never try something new again so you can always stay in top of your game bro..  




 Thanks brotha! I appreciate that! Take a look at the videos online and check facebook from time to time for when the album is going to come out! We are going to make it available for download for free to anyone who wants it :) thanks again man! 




 Its actually a handle bar mustache bt its hard to tell from the picture..freddie didnt have a handle bar mustache ... :/ 




 A female singer definitely would add something interesting to the music! Maybe some background harmony stuff during the heavy parts would be cool! Thanks for taking a listen, glad u like it :) 




 Thank you soo much :) it is very heart warming to have all this support..we really hope that once the album is done we can give it to enough people where it can just start to spread around to anyone who enjoys good music and we feel that with not having vocals we appeal to a more global audience while still maintaining a humbling sound :) glad you like it tho and I am always happy to talk music with anyone! Be on the look out for the new album coming soon, check the website periodically and facebook too :) thanks again! 




 I appreciate that. I am sure the other guys would feel the same way if they were here right now. We try to leave a lot up to the listener and allow them to really make what they want of it. The parts that grab you are intended to do exactly that and the rest is up to the listener :) be on the look out for the new album. Once its done I will put it online for free download to anyone who wants it. I will probably put a post on reddit for it :) 




 Hey thanks sooo much for taking a listen and glad u like! We actually take alot of our inspiration from the bands mogwai, russian circles, minus the bear, explosions in the sky, Sigur Ros, older Yndi Halda...a lot of post rock thats for sure but to be honest, I am unfamiliar with the band you mentioned but i am going to look them up as soon as I can! Thanks again, it means a lot! 




 Yea but i still get more pussy than you ;) 




 Yeeaaahhhh boooyyyyy 




 Ob logic! I was surfing at river mouth in del mar today when this shit happened! Ima need to find another board to get on...my friend is planning a trip to south america next june so i said i would learn to surf for when we went so I gotta do this haha 




 U should play clue bc u nailed it bro 




 haderp! 




 Thanks you sooo much! It is awesome to hear someone say that! We really put in the effort to make our music an experience! Im glad you appreciate the different song feels we put out there for you to listen to! We are trying to do everything that you just conveyed in your last comment so thank you :)
