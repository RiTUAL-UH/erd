 I simply love him :-D 









 The noise when you open up a new glas of Nutella. "Chhhhrrrrrrk" 




 Sweet cheeks are made of this  
who am I to disagree

 Dont say Dont call me again or similar. This will lead them to ask why. Be polite but firm. If they ask why or wont do it right away, remain calm and repeat, I want you to put me on your do not call list.

 Allright then. Very cool gadet.

 Just to get this right...."date" is a synonym for "fuck", right? Right. 




 No Probolem.

Got a Probolem? No Probolem!
