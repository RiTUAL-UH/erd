 Yes I do second-guess my depression a lot. It doesn't help that some people tell me that I'm not depressed, just lazy.  




 I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'. They can't reject you because people need to realise this is a real condition and it has real affects to daily life. Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by. 




 Because I feel like I might be milking it a bit and they might think that I'm just attention seeking or something. But I'll take what I can get 




 I secretly do so I'll wait til they bring it up and then start my guns.
