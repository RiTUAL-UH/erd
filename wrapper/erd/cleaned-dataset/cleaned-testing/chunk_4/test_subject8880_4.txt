 Yeah, we are careful with feeding the puppies. 
I agree with the unconditional Love thing, I don't have any kids so I'm learning on a day by day basis. I'm not used to it so it can be overwhelming.

 Our timeline was split in 2000 during the Presidential elections. It was tied, so the timeline split in half causing 9/11 and other glitches.

 That was a good Metal album. 




 Mid-90's Justice League books after Giffen/DeMattis left was more 90's than X-Treme Justice.

It scared the ever living shit out of me. 




 Continuity. The basis for a deep story and a working universe.

 Or Mid-Life Crisis hipsters. 




 Over-Man from Grant Morrison's Animal Man, Capt. Marvel from Kingdome Come and the League Of Batmen from the DC Multiverse. 




 And Guns N Roses. 




 I play Titanfall on the PS4. You think Sony would give me a PS4?

 I read that in Scrawny Armed Rob Lowe's voice. 




 This sounds suspiciously like Jackson,Tennessee 




 In a very public forum, I would never link my resume with private information. 
I was asking a simple question if anyone has information for careers in the Memphis area. Not to throw attention to employers, but to throw my curiousity into the 901 area.  




 If only I was a good cook. I'm mostly interested in anything IT, security or even anything at the Fed-Ex Forum or a hotel.

 Then why did he speak with an Anerican accent in his first appearences?  The writers knew he was Australian. 




 Capt. Boomerang had an Australian accent in 80's Suicide Squad. I like to think that it was Zantanna who mind warped him to speak in that accent. 




 The Eye was one of the first cosmic entities in comics. Since the Eye is Public Domain, I consider hin in a role similar to the Living Tribunal/the Watcher in my universe.
"Eye witness the Multiverse unfold into anarchy....." 




 Speed force doesn't exist in a Antimatter 5th Dimensional Multiverse. Imagination does. 




 I swear I remember talking to her on the phone years ago. 




 How do we know if the 5th Dimension isn't lying to us?
