Or

When you were young, you were sleeping while someone was talking about the funeral. You were perhaps in the REM stage of the sleep and were dreaming exactly what was being described by that person. That way you got a first person perspective of the whole thing and now remember it as a memory.

 I don't think the mods will mind in this case. And it's not like the number is some "personal information" of the scammer. Post the number so that we can at least report it on truecaller.
