 ah; well in any case, "this guy" indicates that they're not exactly buddies 




 the same way that we all have the ability to sense when something is wrong with a friend or family member, or when you get that feeling that something is not right....you could call it picking up on the vibes, or feeling/reading auras from people, but we all do it; just some people have honed it as a skill and can do it better, or are more aware of doing it.

He must have really really needed to pass gas, and you were just receptive enough at the moment to sense that vibe and urgency radiating from him.

It's a perfectly simple and logical explanation.  

Still a funny story though. 




 they said it was a random guy that did it; the friend was just there with them 




  indigo children

first time I hear that term.  And actually, I wouldn't say so.
Every human being has the potential, it's just a matter of finding out, awakening, and honing it. 

Everyone has dreams occasionally which predict the future;  everyone can sense when something is wrong with a friend of family member, and so forth and so on. 

Doing more than that is just a matter of learning to harness and focus your energy for a purpose.  

IF we are born differently in any way, then its a genetic predisposition to be more open-minded. 




 I was also into it from a younger age too, like spirits, knowing when I was dreaming and being able to wake myself up and such; but I didn't awaken my potential and get actually into into it, as in more actively doing things and participating, until age 12. 




 that's why they typically start you so young I think (usually between 12-16); it is easier to tap into your potential before you've been weighted down by adult responsibilities. 




 well, like I said, really powerful.  I'm assuming the numbers were drawn out of a hat or jar or something, manually?  that may just be really good luck (or a wiccan or Magick spell for luck, as some others said she may have been in that branch/brand of, um, energy manipulation if you will).
If the drawing was done electronically, then that has a much simpler explanation, as thoughts are electrical impulses.  It is not too difficult to manipulate electronics. 




 oh wow; yeah I would say it is.  Although, the statue itself doesn't provide protection (that would be idolatry).  Believing in it does.  So you believed your protection was compromised, opening you up to the continuation of the dreams.  

I was going to say that if that's the case, if the statue kept the dreams at bay, that maybe I never had a dream quite like that because of all the religious symbols my parents had put up in my bedroom.  Then again, I'd had malicious spirits in my room, at least once, so that can't be right.   




 the age doesn't surprise me one bit.  One can be at the height of his or her power at that age; both those working for good and for bad. 




 this is exactly what I was going to say, pretty much.  I practiced "reading minds" too.  One time I freaked this guy out in theater because I knew what number he was thinking, and he was like "She closed her eyes and leaned towards me and........" so the director went into a tale about how aborigines communicate with their minds.

But yeah, in middle school, I was also good at getting my way, with words.  I could talk my way out of anything.  In high school one time, I even talked a teacher into doing an assignment for something else for me on the board, without him even knowing it.  

I don't try to manipulate people anymore though; that was immature.

You can subconsciously manipulate people as well.   Like one time, back in middle school, we were doing a fund-raiser, selling candles and stuff, and several of us had approached my English teacher to buy some from us.  She said she would after our assignment.  I made sure I was the last one to speak to her/ make an impression before sitting down.  Sure enough, she called me up first.  The others were like "that's not fair; I asked first."  It's just psychology.

now, some of the things you describe sound like more than that.  I was also quite lucky, but this is more than that. 

She was probably just really powerful at manipulating her energy, and she was clearly at least somewhat darkside.

I encountered people who were darkside too.  It's a good thing your mom knew to tell you to wall up your mind.  You have a very open-minded mom.  Did you ever learn any more about protecting yourself?  like how to do an aura shield or anything?  every try to learn to read minds yourself?

Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about this more.  I'm always happy to help. 




 (I'm 21 too! :) )
predictive dreams are normal and quite common, but reoccurring dreams are a strange thing.  I've always thought of reoccurring dreams to mean that the same exact dream repeats over and over on different occasions.  If, using your definition, you take it to mean the same family of dreams, then I've had a few. 
I've had some nightmares that I had a handful of times as a child, but I am not talking about that.

The most recent reoccurring dream I've had (by your definition), was last year; on a few occasions, I dreamed about a secret upstairs to my parents' house, which is accessed through a hidden door in their bedroom closet.  (the physics of the whole thing are physically impossible for the structure, so no, it's not actually secretly there).  The first one was an epic adventure involving aliens and the end of the world and whatnot, but the other dreams I've had there were your average everyday dream that just took place there at least part of the time.  Same place, same layout, same decor.

Now, this second example is a whole different animal.  It's a reoccurring dream and a predictive (or rather, indicative, dream).

Surely you are familiar with the classic "I Love Lucy" sketch with the chocolates on a conveyor belt?  Well, that concept of an assembly line type situation, where things are moving and I am unable to do my tasks on time to keep up and it all goes to hell. I have a dream like that every time I get a stomach virus.  It occurs right before I "get sick" for the first time of the virus.  It's a slightly different scenario every time, but it's always an assembly line type of task that I can't keep up with, and it always ends with me waking up in the middle of the night to run to the bathroom. 

I only have those dreams when I am getting a stomach virus, and I have them every time.  

It's not that useful as a predictor as I only have the dream when It's already about to happen.   




  working with the angels, but for the most part demons and dark energies either don't exist to me or I just completely ignore them.

if you're not fighting dark entities, then what do you do working with the angels exactly?   Healing?  like your name says? 




 you say you were going through some rough stuff, so maybe it was a demon trying to take advantage of your situation, or it could, of course, just be a manifestation of your concerns into a dream.  Fighting your inner demons.  
It is weird that it asked for your soul though.  Never had anything like that happen.  Probably because they know not to bother asking, lol. 




 One day, God beckons to you from above.  "Come with me, my loyal follower, and I will show you the great things you long for."

You find yourself in awe that, having heard your prayers, among all others, he called for you.

You answer the calling, and in a flash, find yourself in Heaven.  Angels assure you that you will go home, that your life won't end here, but they offer you to stay the day.  They give you the grand tour of all the joy and bounty of Heaven bathed in the knowledge, wisdom, and love of God's glory.  

You soak it all up, and are filled with wonder, comfort, and joy.  This could one day be your new home.  You enjoy the splendor of the afternoon; come to love the transcendent way of life.

Then, the angels tell you they must close the gates.  It is time for you to go. You knew it was coming, and it's all well and good.  You want to live out your life, afterall.  It would be nice to assure others of the powerful joy that awaits, to spread the word of the love and tranquility, but the Angels tell you that you mustn't tell a soul.  Unsure of what to say when leaving heaven, you simply thank the Angels and bid them farewell.  

You find yourself back on the street corner at which you were called.  The corner is the same; but, you have changed.  You carry with you knowledge of a most beautiful existence, which you had the pleasure and privilege to briefly live.  You sleep soundly in bliss.

As you awaken, and return to the weekly grind, you realize how dry and tumultuous life can be.  You long to return to heaven.  But you have duties to fulfill here.  We must all do our time.  

You, knowing what joy can be, having experienced the splendor, can feel tortured by its absence.  But you at least know that one day, you will return to Heaven; maybe in a different time, a different way, a different place.  One day, you will bask in the glory again, and live in peace forever.  




 This kind of thing happens to me all the time.  Sometimes things just fall between thing and I find them before too long.  BUT, Sometimes things turn up again months later, in completely random places.  It's very strange 




 life is?  no, you mean studying abroad is. lol 




 logical fallacies ftw 




 or, to be somewhat silly for a change (as the more serious answers have already been said), maybe the seagull was hosting the spirit of the person who drowned, and was desperately looking to share it with anyone who would be receptive.

the fact that it flew off right after is suspicious...

It could also just be a vivid hallucination.  I've never even dreamed my own death in any scenario.  If a dream gets to the point that I might die, I always wake up.  So, I can't speak to that at all. 




 you should post some of these stories on /r/Thetruthishere , if you haven't already 




 I'm glad Ms. Medium was able to help you.  
I'm also pleased to see that you knew your attached spirit's name. 
I knew mine as well.  He's been distant the past couple years.  Actually, I think it's probably I who have been distant, but that's another matter entirely.

Most spirits are harmless (physically); your descriptions before of the basement spirit sounded rather gnarly though.  I'm glad Ms.Medium was able to come and help you assess the situation. 

The camera probably won't be able to pick up on anything you might be able to see (or you might see it in the video but others don't ?  not sure how that works exactly, as I can't see them in the traditional sense myself); not sure about the audio either, as your bf could hear a man but you couldn't.  

Whether or not Steve is your guardian angel, I would think he'd want you to  get stronger rather than rely on him to stand up for you.  Feel free to message me with any questions you might have in that regard, and I'll give you any advice that I can. 




 HELLO; THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE IN HERE; I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK OVER THE POUNDING OF THE BLOOD RUSHING IN HERE. 
CAN YOU TRY TO RELAX? TAKE A BREAK?  MAYBE TAKE SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE?  AND THE TENSION?
THAT CONGESTION DOESN'T HELP; YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.  YOUR BRAIN NEEDS MORE OXYGEN! 




 [about the topic choice] by the way, did you know that Mr.Rogers spoke to congress? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q  




 It is important in life to be a good neighbor.  You may not always agree with your neighbor, but he has just as much right to disagree with you.

Cutting off heads isn't going to solve anything.  If you really want to convince people that you are right, that does not come from violence.  Violence turns people away from you.  If you really believe in your cause, then people will follow you for the cause.  

Words are more powerful than you can imagine.  Use words to show your neighbor why you are so passionate about your mission, and maybe they will see things your way.  Be a movement which inspires people.

If you really want to build an Islamic state, then talk, preach.  Then, maybe, some people will listen.  

If you try to force your neighbor to do something, he will just find a new neighbor. 




 ugh, horns are arbitrary.  Red and impish is devil enough for me 




 Ok, sir, I have completed my inspection, and I have concluded that you are either going to have to do some serious renovations, or I will have to condemn the property. 

For starters, you CANNOT have a lava pool in your basement.  It's a safety hazard, a fire hazard, and every other hazard in the book. 

Also, your home is too tall.  The building code states that no structure built within 30 blocks of the beach can be over 12 blocks high....yours is 100....

Additionally, having a trapdoor outside the entrance to your house, which leads to a dungeon, is highly, highly illegalllllllllllll----------------------------------------------------------
*thud*

 




 yes, of course.  you'd need to figure out why it is there; what it's issue is.  Not necessarily who it is, but that may go hand in hand with why it's there.  

What it is would also be good to know. 

How to deal with the spirit depends entirely on what it is and why its there.  

Using your former home as an example:

If, for example, it's a murder victim, he or she may want to avenge the murder.  Ways to help could be to talk it down to move on, or, if communication is possible, and he or she gives the name of a killer, to bring the truth to light.  Worst case scenario, in a murder victim example, would be that their body is hidden and was never found; if they reveal the location of it, then going with an authority of some sort to exhume it and properly bury it would solve the problem.

Again, that is just a murder victim example; but, even with that one case, as you can see, there can be multiple ways to address it, depending on the specifics.

So, how, might you find out who it is and what its' unfinished business is?  I would look into the history of the house for starters.  Find out who lived there before and if anyone died in the house, or if any of the people who lived there died in suspicious circumstances.

As I said before, the spirit may or may not be related to the other, nice spirits.  Trying to identify them may help identify it.

If those searches turn up nothing unusual, then the entity may have nothing to do with the house, but you, the current inhabitants.  Like I said, it could have been a negative force keeping an eye on you and your brother as you have demonstrated ability to see and sense spirits.  

That was a hypothetical example using your description of your experience at home, but the methodology is applicable to other, similar situations.

-------
Regardless, work on getting stronger, and don't provoke negative spirits, especially if you don't know what they're capable of or what they want. 




 ah; "devil god"; so that explains his appearance. 




 real-life duplication glitch; cool!
worm hole termporarily opened in the space between your bed and nightstand?

I've had things disappear and come back before, but that could easily just be misplacing or someone else moving them.

I remember reading another story on here recently involving finding something and then losing its' twin in the future (so it had glitched into the past).

Maybe it glitched in from somewhere else, and will glitch away again for its real owner to find it...
or maybe its' yours from the future (you like the belt so much you end up getting another when it wears down, but then it goes missing (to the past here) and then you'll find it again and think nothing of it, unless you remember this incident at that time. )

It is documented now, my friend, so if it disappears as mysteriously as it came, and that future thing happens, you'll know.

Better yet, mark it.  Mark it in some indelible unusual way.  Carve your initials inside the buckle where no one would think to look but you.  

so, if, in the future, you do buy another one and it disappears, when it comes back, check for the mark.

Cheers! 




 yes; I was thinking the same thing about the amnesia; everything in this story is medically explainable.  she's lucky she didn't end up permanently paralyzed though.  Epidural gone wrong can do that 




 no problem; I will draw a couple of these as soon as I can 




 I just found this sub today, but there is another sub, which I also found today, /r/DrawForMe which is exactly like this one, so you may want to cross post this there as well.  

Would you want these to be drawn as best as possible, or as if a 4th grader drew it?   




 you did a decent job; that is actually good concept art.  Just take your drawing, and the pics of the individual items, to the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist will draw it better for you.  That's what I did with mine.  (By better, I mean a better-looking Pikachu for one, and a pointier style butterfly wings on another.)  Their improvements to your concept art can be major or minor, depending on the level of detail and the style you are going for.   




 it's perfectly normal.   Just, ditto everything I just said here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/3008ya/dreams_of_future_events/cpoh780 




 well, if a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, it definitely still makes a sound; what changes is whether or not that sound is of consequence to anyone.  

so whether you film yourself or not, you're still going to do whatever you're going to do.  although, subconsciously, knowing that you're filming it, your mind may exercise more control, to make you behave, or the opposite, to make you show off.   




 by vengeful spirit I meant something seeking violent revenge, so likely not.  

An unhappy spirit, certainly.  It may also have been some other entity entirely, keeping an eye on you / keeping tabs on you because you could see the others. 

Or, alternatively, this negative spirit may have a problem with the other spirits, or the house itself.  Murder victim perhaps?  victim of some sort. 




 yeah, like I said on the original post; it sounds like this is a spirit you can peacefully co-exist with.  Just try not to think about it, and when things happen, don't worry about it; just dismiss it, unless it's really bothering you or causing some sort of inconvenience or discomfort that must be addressed; then, just nicely ask it to stop. 




 This is quite common and normal.  Some people are more receptive to it than others; some people remember their dreams better than others; but, it happens to all kinds of people, all the time.

My most recent one was in January.  I've mentioned it in other comments, but basically, in the middle of a normal, random dream, I had to go to the store with my mom to return some socks.  The next morning, guess what my mom tells me we have to do?  But the socks in the dream were white.  The irl ones were black.  But so what?

Some possible explanations (there is not necessarily one right explanation; these may all be valid and true, with some applying to some cases, and others to other cases):

- overheard something in your sleep
- **picked up on the vibes/ wavelengths (vocal, radio, thoughts, etc)**
- self-fulfilling prophecies
- etc. (those are the main three)

another, more far-fetched explanation just occurred to me; this could apply to the ones that occur with longer spans of time in between, and is a perfect illustration by what I mean by "etc."; one could speculate this forever. : maybe your future self was thinking "I wish I knew about this sooner", and that wishful thought transfers the thought energy back in time through your dreams.  

Point is, who knows.  We can sit here and think of plausible theories all day, but the bold one is most often the culprit and has the most logical support.  (I can expand upon this if you like). 




 ah ok; yeah; I just got that impression from what your mom said couple with your incredulous wondering if you did it, lol.  I think others may have got the same impression.

this may be an episode of somnambulism, or it could be someone else (living or dead) messing with you; if so, that could almost be taken as a threat.  But if it's been a while and nothing else has come of it, I wouldn't be concerned.  Particularly, given your mom's statements, it is likely sleepwalking/sleepmoving.  you may have used scissors or a knife on the sheets in your sleep, but if you did that, then that's scary in and of itself. 




 Whoa, ok guys; I just happened to come back here today, browsing, and I see how small this sub is.  I used to keep a blog about my dream adventures here: http://epicdreamadventures.blogspot.com/

Now, I don't sleep enough currently to have as many adventure dreams, but I do still have interesting ones, and predictive/psychic or what have you ones as well.  

I've noticed people posting the latter kind on /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix 

Anyhow, let's expand, and document our dreams more.

Remember guys, dreams are our subconscious's way of making sense of things.

Sometimes they're really random and silly neuron firing that is vaguely related to the day's media and events.  Sometimes they reveal (metaphorically, like a fable) things we subconsciously picked up on but didn't realize, or things that we don't want to admit to ourselves.

In the case of predictive dreams, time-stamped documentation can help serve as proof that you did indeed dream the event before it occurred.

Lastly, a tip for remembering your dreams.  
1. get enough sleep (obvious)
2. (less obvious) take notes (just an outline/ bullet points) when you first wake up, if you dont have time to write/type it out right then.  This will allow you to come back later and remember enough to tell the story.  Within a few minutes of waking, you forget most of it, but not if you take bullet point notes.  That's how I was able to do that blog so well.  I never added to or embellished anything in those dream stories.  Lots of them were great for that though; full of potential.  I can turn some of them into nice short stories if I wanted to.

Anyhow, let's get back into the dream-story-sharing; what do you say? 




   harmless poltergeisting

I'm skeptical of that statement.  I mean, I understand what you mean (moving stuff), but...that can escalate/ go south quickly; but, again, that depends on the nature of the spirit.  So, again, look up the history.

A friend of mine has a ghost on her property which I did not find out about (having never stayed there long enough) until like the 8th time I'd been there.  we were standing talking.  there was no one behind me, and something thunked/flicked my purse.  I felt the tap, but there was nothing there to have done it.  I expressed my surprise, and then she told me about the boy who was killed in a fire there, and who sometimes messes around in the house. 

he's been around for many many years, and is clearly harmless, not a vengeful spirit.  

Just make sure you look into the history, ok?  can't stress that enough.

edit: to clarify, I was getting ready to leave, and thus, I was wearing the purse (handbag) when he thunked it, which is how come I felt it. 




 just this I guess: https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/301jdo/ghost_hunting/cpoeitn
