PS: I really like the chart and diagrams. 




 First, this made me really sad. Then I laughed a lot. This post has taught me that I'm an emotionally complicated person. 




 Why did he keep holding onto dude's phone after being thrown onto the ground? Why did that seem like a good idea? 




 Whoops.

 Although he doesn't specifically mention step 2, I believe it has something to do with hosing down the crackhead.
