 8, plus most of the game he was injured in. Plus several games in earlier seasons. Altogether, it adds up to about the same number of games Brady or Peyton have missed in their careers due to injury, but I see your point. 




 By that logic, it doesn't matter if someone was great 2 seasons ago (or last season for that matter) if they have fallen off now. 




 After this season, he will have 2 MVP seasons, and a Super Bowl MVP. You don't think someone with those stats should make it in the HOF? 




 Rodgers has already had an injury that sidelined him for most of the season and come back from it. 




 You're good. Most people here see your intent. I was just pointing it out for OP. 




 I'm sorry, but that's just not right. Banks look at intangibles. There's no way they'd trust two 18 year olds with $100,000 loan. This guy's "work history" was a retail store as a teenager. No loan officer would approve that. Like I said earlier, is it possible? Yes. Likely? Not a chance. 




 Dude I'm not saying it's not possible. Just that it's unlikely. This was retail, not life guarding. He would also have to have averaged 35 hours a week while in school full time, never taking sick or vacation days, never spend ANY of the money, and find a bank willing to loan a couple of 18 year olds somewhere in the order of $100,000.

Taken in its entirety, it seems unbelievable. 




 I don't doubt that it's not possible. But **16 years ago**, working retail as a 16 year old. Nobody would be paying $12/hour. 




 No don't post the yelp review here.

Now, if you didn't actually do anything that you're aware of, he likely has very little evidence (if any) that you did this. Any judge will see through this charade as an attempt to scare you off your claim of collecting your paycheck. It will be painfully obvious to everyone. 

Also, did he threaten to sue you over text, letter, phone call, or voicemail? If anything besides phone call, save all the evidence for court. 




 Just to reiterate on that 2nd point, OP.

We were all young and dumb at some point in our lives. Unless we have been told before, we don't know not to talk to the cops and fully trust them as authority figures.

Yes, you told them everything which will be used against you in court, but at 17, me and any number of people on this sub who like to chide people for doing that probably would have done the same thing in your situation.

Eventually you'll be past this. As for now, the best thing you can do is hire a lawyer if you can afford one. 




 Maybe knock on the apt door and ask the guy if he's month to month. Because if he's not, he'll want to have a word with the landlord as well. 




 I think Johny was a little too mad for the interview. 




 That's what I feel is going on here. Does the dude have 1.5M met worth? Probably. But I doubt he earned it starting from purely a retail high school income and investing in housing with his other 18 year old friend to get himself started. 




 But this guy would have had to make that same amount nearly 16 years ago. Inflation kills a lot of that. 




 I don't need you to lie, buddy. But let me entertain the question: how on earth do I seem insane? I'm legitimately questioning the guy when his story doesn't add up.

If it's a lie, then he should probably stop misleading people. I'm not saying it is, only that his story is suspicious, as numerous others have pointed out here. ~~But if calling people out doesn't matter, why are you doing it to me? I mean truly, who should be the one to "shut the fuck up and move on"?~~ 




 Yea I agree. There's just no way.

I'm trying to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, but he's making it hard.

Like if he said his grandparents gifted him $10K, and his dad was a contractor by trade (to the point he could actually learn how to rehab a house by 18), and he got his loans from a hard money lender that happened to be his uncle. Yea, then I'd believe a little more. But with this story and his refusal to answer specific questions, I'm suspicious at best. 




 I'm just pointing out what doesn't make sense, and since you are refusing to clarify I cannot see how it would be possible. 




 That's not how it works... If she turns 15 tomorrow and he turned 17 yesterday, the age difference is only 2 years and 2 days. 




 How off? I just don't see it unless you were earning at LEAST $12 an hour (which almost nobody would pay a teenager in retail in 1998). I mean you still had some expenses as you admitted in other posts here. You still had school, and you probably took some sick days here and there. I mean it's just a bit unrealistic when you insist that you did this all without any family help.

Also how in the world did you get a bank to loan you tens of thousands of dollars to you and your partner with almost no experience and no credit? 




 Assuming you were making around 7.25 an hour, which would be appropriate for a 16 year old retail job, to earn $20k, you would have to have averaged over 30 hours per week every single week, after taxes, to save that amount in 2 years. That's assuming you never spent a single penny. On top of this you were in highschool for these 2 years.

That's just not realistic.

Edit: just realized you worked in 98. At a retail job, your wage almost surely would not have been more than 6.50, (5.50 or so after taxes). Meaning you would have had to average nearly 35 hours a week with no sick days, and never spending a penny. 




 I'm not saying there is a law that states he can detain people. I'm saying the bartender has a moral duty to call the cops and that laws designed to prevent rape override company policy in any reasonable person. 




 How did you get $20K from 16 to 18?

Did you go to college?

What kind of job did you have, and can you give a rough break estimate of your earnings throughout your 20's? 




 You realize laws overrule "policy"? 




 Smoke sesh brah 




 My 1L Property prof JUST covered this as a hypo today. According to him, the Blue Neighbor would get an Easement by Necessity across Purple Neighbor's land.

This situation is complicated by the fact that Purple informed Blue of fencing in the gravel road area, but it seems to me that a judge will require the easement across Purple's land, and for Blue to compensate Purple for it. 




 See now you have a reasonable argument there. There was likely something in your contract that said they must provide you with reasonable service, which any judge would determine Sprint did not.

OP, on the other hand, he just wants out (and maybe reasonably so), but you gotta pay according to the terms of the contract. 




 Just FYI, you signed the contract that (I'm assuming) stated when you terminate, you are responsible for the full last month. So you are no longer bound by the contract, but are bound by that condition. I understand why you're angry, but you literally signed the contract stating you would abide by that condition.

No judge will let you out of this. It will only ruin your credit score, costing you money in the future in the form of higher interest rates if you had a higher credit score.

Just pay it. 




 Then it would have been on to /r/legaladvice. Man Reddit really does have everything! Dude should get his budget checked over at /r/personalfinance  while he's at it. 




 I'm not saying it made him fight a bad fight, only that it most likely affected him in some way. I think he would have done better if he did not have the mental aspect of nearly dying from the weight cut, and I don't see how you could argue against that.

I'm sure it was you, but whatever, deny all you want. It was minutes after my comment, deep into our comment tree when you're the only one likely to see it or with any motive to downvote. Further, you only had 1 upvote on your previous 2/3 comments, meaning if it was someone else, it's highly likely they would have downvoted me and upvoted you at the same time. 




 I am simply saying it is more likely that he is affected more than the average fighter based on the fact that he almost died from a weight cut. Even if it is only a mental effect, every time he cuts to 205, it's somewhere in his mind that he nearly died, likely affecting his performance even a minimal amount.

Also, you're a jerk for down voting my opinion. 




 Dude. At least spray paint it the same color. I had my car keyed and did that. Nobody can tell unless they're less than 5 feet away. 




 How are you debunking it? With what evidence? My argument is that it has a possible mental effect on DC enough to affect his performance. You cannot conclusively say DC would not have performed better at 205 without the weight cut. 




 I'm just saying, it's a factor. 




 A bottle of ketchup in 40 seconds?! Yeesh! 




 Unless the weight cut takes too much out of them. Remember, DC had to be hospitalized for kidney failure and almost died in the Olympics when he cut to 211 pounds. Now he wants to cut 6 MORE pounds. Yea, he's probably on a diet to help the cut, but it's just a factor to keep in mind. 




 If we both win out, then it still comes down to week 17 for division title, you know. 




 It's so funny how the other side sees it. It took me a second to even remember what you were referencing.

To me: we barely missed sealing the game by Adams' fingertips.

That's POV for you though. 




 So refreshing. 




 With my taxes, absolutely. It is a problem of our society, and we should solve it as a society.

Edit: Not to mention, the cost of what? A few port-a-potty's and a dumpster? Yes I think that is cheap enough where it shouldn't even be a controversial issue. 




 I think one nice act is pretty good. They are not totally responsible for all the people they feed. Are they responsible for housing the homeless as well just because they feed them? 




 Surely the solution would not be to provide them with bathrooms and trashcans, but instead cut off their food supply. 




 Third Parties ~~can never~~ are very very unlikely to win in First Past the Post systems. It's [Duverger' Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law). 




 Gerrymandering 




 More likely, flexibility. 




 I was just pointing out the difference between the words though. 




 I was not pointing out anything specific to this series of events. Only the difference between objective and subjective. 




 100% disagree. You never know when you could be fired, have your car stop working, family member die and need to attend the funeral, etc. That's the whole point of emergency funds. I fully believe everyone should make 6+ months of expenses a priority. I don't think he needs to sell any possessions to reach that emergency fund amount, only that any excess money go to the emergency fund before anything else, including debt or retirement.

Edit: Your point that 6 months is overkill unless you have dependents or a mortgage seems logically wrong. Why would either of those decrease the amount of emergency fund you need in time? It seems those should only effect the amount of emergency fund you have, which is already controlled for by saving 6 times monthly expenses. 




 Objectively reasonable belief does not mean specific to the person, only to the standard of a reasonably prudent person.

You're thinking "subjective." 




 Hey, just to piggyback on this post and give you some more opinions, I definitely think you need more than $1K as an emergency fund. What if you lose your job? 6 months of expenses should be the MINIMUM. I'd bet that would be at least $8K for you, if not more, depending on your expenses. 




 Eh.... sure. 




 I enjoyed 22 Jump Street far more than this sequel. HB2 had some decently funny moments, but nothing crazy. The beginning of how they got into their predicament felt too forced. And the movie just didn't capture the magic the first one had (jokes were almost too raunchy to make up for lack of plot).


SPOILER BELOW!!!














They could have just filed a lawsuit and not had to go through with the entire process. The excuse given in the movie for not filing the lawsuit was "oh the other side has powerful lawyers." People still sue Walmart. This was a textbook case of breach of contract they had and they would have easily won in court. 




 Yea, I've lived in the middle of Texas and now southern California my whole life. Something tells me we don't have the same definitions of "incredibly temperate." 




 I'm seeing it.... Yea, I'm there. 




 That was rude. 




 I don't get this. 




 When did he become governor of Alaska?!? Man I miss some big news sometimes. 




 Wait did this actually happen or are you just being funny? 




 At this point, can we just skip the Siver fight and have Conor fight Aldo now. Then at least Edgar can get his rematch sooner. I'd have him fight Lamas for the next shot at the same time Aldo/Conor happens. 




 I'm not going to say this is a good option, or that I'm recommending it, only that it IS an option:

You could always lie to her and tell her you love her and want to be with her but will break up with her unless she has an abortion. And afterwards you actually can break up with her.

Important to note: if you take this route she will likely hate you forever and fall into a deep depression. On the other hand, if you think she willfully lied to you about her taking proper birth control, you might not care. 




 Thanks for the info! 




 Ok, that makes sense. Is a borrower able to drop it if they refinance, like PMI? 




 It is for the life of the loan. That's why you need to refinance to get rid of it.

Edit: I think I'm confusing MIP for PMI. If so, please disregard. 




 You're wrong. And for a very simple reason: preventative care is cheaper than fixing a health problem.

You ask what incentive people have to stay healthy. The incentive to live longer! It would go against human instinct to let yourself get sick merely because your healthcare was free.

Back to preventative care. It is VASTLY cheaper to use healthcare to stop a disease before it happens than to heal one after it already starts. With free healthcare, you would have most of the population going to the doctor multiple times per year to stay healthy or catch health problems early. Whereas today, many Americans wait to go to the doctor until the last second because they cannot afford healthcare.

Further, people who wait until the last second for their healthcare are often using their local ER, which is substantially more expensive than a family doctor. And because they are poor and have no health insurance, the cost is passed onto tax payers.

As a country we pay more per person for healthcare than any other nation in the world, and it's not even close. And for this, we receive less services. Many thousands of Americans DIE every year directly because of a lack of access to affordable healthcare. That is not a recipe for success. Single payer is the most economical and moral solution. 




 For some countries, yes, it is a longer wait time, but for others they actually have shorter average wait times to see doctors than the US. I specifically remember one study that broke down wait times by service received and by country. I don't have it off the top of my head right now since I'm in the middle of studying for finals right now (ugh law school), but I will try to find the source and edit it in by tomorrow. 




 Cheaper per capita, longer life spans, less medical bankruptcies, shorter waits for doctors (in some countries-not all- and only for the lower four quintiles of income, since the rich will always get their healthcare in the US), not to mention much lower costs per service since they are substantially less bloated with beauracracy as insurance isn't big in most of those countries.

The biggest thing though is that the poor in those countries are much likely to receive preventative care and thus save the ER room bloat when they would otherwise go in for the flu when it's about to kill them instead of receiving a small amount of care a week earlier. This saves the govt in those countries billions every year. 




 Right there with you buddy. Econ major here who studied health economics under a couple PhD's while in undergrad, and it's just mind blowing how much better and cheaper those systems work. 




 Wait. You're saying you don't think single payer is the most economical healthcare solution? 




 Instead I'll leave this quotation that is on point instead. It has a source in it. Just for background, I'm a law student and virtually everyone in the community sees Chemerinsky as the premier legal scholar on Constitutional Law. Here he is talking directly about Obama enforcing the immigration order:

The president clearly and unquestionably has the authority to do this, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law. Presidents always get to decide what laws to enforce or not enforce. Chemerinsky cited the Supreme Court case United States v. Nixon, which held that the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case. The president can direct law enforcement to decline to prosecute an entire class of people  in this case, parents of U.S. citizens  without even approaching a legal gray area, he said.

Source: http://news.yahoo.com/how-congress-can-fight-obama-s-immigration-order-193627501.html 




 What a feast he would be! 




 Presidents can and have simply ordered laws not to be followed. Regardless of whether it is against their oath of office or not, nearly every president has ordered select laws not to be followed. That's exactly what Obama has done with not enforcing raids on medical marijuana dispenseries. Why no public outcry there? 




 Please explain how you think the Supreme Court will find the executive order unconstitutional. Nearly every president for the past 50 years has acted unilaterally on immigration and none of those have been found unconstitutional.

The bottom line is that it's completely within a president's scope to enact this type of order.

You are correct in that processing work permits do cost money. And congress could pass a budget defunding the permits. But Obama will never sign such a budget, and thus it will be congress who will be blamed for not passing a budget which could lead to another govt shutdown which the Republicans will surely bear the burden for (again). 




 I agree we'd have to see the order before knowing for sure. I was speaking in generalities based on what it seems the order will be. And merely costing the money to print the order is not substantive enough to be practically defunded. 




 How would an order telling them not to enforce the status quo require money? 




 You can't defund an order that requires no money. All his order would do is stop enforcing the current deportation effort. 




 How do you know what to dispute and what the actual codes are? 




 I dunno. Women are outpacing men in higher education. Continue that for another 100 years and I definitely think average pay for women will be above men. 




 This isn't on you, but it is extremely frustrating that not one of those sources provided the ACTUAL pay gap after controlling for position, education, experience, and hours worked. I mean why are all these authors assuring us the gap "virtually disappears" then not providing the actual gap? So frustrating. 




 I agree. I was being very conservative there. 




 Money talks. I believe at least 90% of people would choose the latter option. 




 Well of course. If a person doesn't agree with the taxed item, they are unlikely to indulge in it and thus won't be paying the tax, while people who do indulge will be stuck with the extra tax. 




 According to this compound interest calculator (http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) if you start with $38K, add $12K per year for 40 years and the market grows at 5.5% then yes you will have over $2M. 

However, at average annual inflation, prices will double every 20 years (source: http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp). This means that your $2M will feel like $500K. At the safe withdrawal rate of 4%, that means you'll be living on $20K a year. That sucks. However, you can combat this by raising your contribution rate as your income increases over those 40 years. I don't have a calculator, but I imagine you could easily have $4M in the account by retirement, meaning $1M in today's money, meaning you'll live on what feels like $40K in today's money. That's realistic. 




 Not sure if it works anymore, but I have a POTENTIAL solution.

About 5 years ago, I set up a credit card, one of those 1 year no interest cards, with a $10K limit and bought coins from the US Treasury, then just went and deposited them at my bank. Free shipping, no fees. Bank gave me some crap, but allowed it.

Or you could buy a big expensive item such as a TV with your credit card, and just resell it as brand new on Craigslist. Yea, you'll lose about 10% but desperate times call for desperate measures.

Edit: Buy an Amazon gift card! You can buy them up to $2000 and you can sell them for probably 97% of the value. Sell on Craigslist with A TON of proof. 




 Look into PAYE. Depends on when you got the loans and if they are federal or private.

PAYE works by:

1) taking your salary
2) then subtracting 1.5 times the poverty line, now $17,500
3) then you pay 10% of the amount left each year (divide by 12 for monthly payment)

If your income was $30,000 for example, you would pay $104 per month MAXIMUM.

You pay the amount according to the formula for 20 years and anything after will be forgiven. Although you will be taxed on the amount forgiven as if it were income, but this is still a better deal than if you paid the whole amount. 




 Oh I have no idea. Was it?

I was only saying that cause I moved here a couple months ago, and the planes fly so close to the buildings where I live. 




 Not true. That could be charged as criminal mischief. They're creating the impression they just stole from you, which is dangerous in case anyone retaliates. 




 I don't know cause it hasn't come out in my area yet. :(

They did a very poor job letting everyone know that it was such a limited release. But I'll let you know what I think next weekend. 




 Took me a couple looks, but it says GLUE, most likely as in "I like huffing glue" by the looks of him. 




 This is now a realistic fear since moving to San Diego. 




 Sorry I have no advice but to wait out the process.

However, in the future, the best protection you can have is to use a bank account, and use a credit card attached to the account to set to auto-pay the full amount every month. In a situation like this, you would still have money to use (up to the credit limit) and almost surely not be responsible for any of the money the thief spent. 




 What is the breed of that dog?! It's so cute. 




 You need an attorney. Depending on the state you live in, he may be able to get half the house's equity or may not, also depending on what proof of him cheating you have.

Do not sign anything without an attorney. If you cannot afford to pay him half the value of the equity in the house you may be forced to sell and split the proceeds. 




 It's almost hilarious that a cop caught with a theft conviction will be back on the job in 30 days. Almost. 




 Possibly from the perp's point of view, but a prank can still be a crime. And here it appears to be. 




 It's so weird to watch those accident scenes where the medics are loading the victim after having seen the movie Nightcrawler. 




 Seriously. If that happened in the US, he'd be in federal prison regardless of how many lives he saved. 




 Assert dominance. Keep petting cause I'm not a little bitch and I need to show him who's boss. 




 Oh my. Dumb me didn't even notice your username. Cheers! 




 1000% on the Supreme Court point. It looks like Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsberg, and Breyer will all need to be replaced within the next presidency. 2 liberals, 1 conservative, and 1 "swing" (who is really more conservative). If Clinton was president, the Court would be composed of 6 liberals to 3 conservatives after these four current justices were replaced and that would massively change how the court rules than if we got a Republican in office, where the Court would then be composed of 7 conservatives and 2 liberals in that case. 




 I'm being hyperbolic but serious. In those oil towns, demand is so high for labor that fast food restaurants have to pay $13-15 per hour because otherwise those workers would just go work in the oil fields. (Source: http://www.cnbc.com/id/101767406)

The average wage with under a year experience is around $67K/year, while the average wage overall is $100K/year. (Source: http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/oil_workers/)

Yes, it is a legitimate option, but it's not very realistic for most people. If someone had no family that relied on them and no reason to stay in their current city of residence with a massive amount of debt, and wanted a little adventure in their life while simultaneously taking care of that debt, I think it's a viable option. But only you can answer that. 




 It's not his top priority. It took 6 years to get here.

Also, the number of issues he can handle is not some finite resource (although technically it is, realistically it is not). He has many many people working on solutions for many many issues. Why not handle immigration while it's a hot topic? 




 Agree. Where in her career has she shown exceptional strategy? Meanwhile, she has a proven track record in banking. While I'm all for her moving up in the party, this is more of a horizontal shift than vertical. 




 Listen, I'm way more in agreement with Sanders' views than Clinton's.

But here's why I'm going to vote for Clinton over Sanders in the Democratic Primary: because Sanders won't win the presidency and Clinton can and likely would against any Republican challenger.

The reality is that if Sanders went up against a Republican challenger in the general, he would probably lose. The fact is that Americans in general just aren't that liberal. Here's a chart posted in another /r/politics thread that shows how the Dems of the US are basically the Conservative party of the UK (http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2014-11-06/tax5.png). Yes it isn't a perfect representation, and is only one issue, but I think you would find that general trend to be true in many other issues here in the US.

While Clinton will do many things I will likely disagree with in her presidency, I'm thinking bigger picture. And I'd rather have Clinton in office than the ACA repealed, immigration reform stifled, marijuana legalization held off further, gay rights trampled on, and net neutrality a dream.

If Sanders (by what would be nearly a miracle) beats Hillary in the primaries, he will almost surely lose the general election, and you can say goodbye to all those issues I just listed. 




 I'm guessing he's including FICA, and maybe even a 401K contribution. 




 It is not. She need to give them 60 days written notice as soon as possible. Then file for eviction assuming no changes by then.

Also, she should give the new January tenants the courtesy of letting them know the property won't likely be ready January 1st.
