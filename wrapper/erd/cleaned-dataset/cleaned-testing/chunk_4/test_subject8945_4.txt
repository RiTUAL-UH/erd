 I hate Time Warner as much as the next guy, but I feel like there's a scumbag reddit meme in this title. Something along the lines of: 

CORPORATIONS AREN'T PEOPLE 

UNLESS ONE EMPLOYEE CALLS A CUSTOMER A CUNT AND THE WHOLE COMPANY IS TO BLAME 




 Modern Family. Those characters were spot on Episode 1.
