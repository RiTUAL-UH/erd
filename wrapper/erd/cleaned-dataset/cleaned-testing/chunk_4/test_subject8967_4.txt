 The mask was in the passenger seat of the car driving Casper. 




 I remember in season one Marty had the horns above his head in the poster, and I looked back on the promotional posters from season 2 and found this.

The crow in the middle of the road has to be a reference to the Birdman, right?

Edit 1: By Birdman I mean the bird mask that has been shown/worn in both episodes of season 2.
