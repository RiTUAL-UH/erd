 What else are you supposed to do when another man looks longingly into your eyes from a kissings distance?  




 Not sure if anyone explained, but this is copied and pasted from an article:

The important thing to note is that theyre not suing Fox under US Law (because it would probably go nowhere and theyve probably been informed of this by the French Ambassador in Washington).

The lawsuit is most likely in French Court (which has a lower standard of proof for libel cases than US courts, and less restrained by Free Speech statutes like courts in the US are) and I also wouldnt be surprised if a similar suit had been, or will be filed in European (EU) court (Which is actually more serious and a bigger deal because that ruling wouldnt just be binding to France but to EU member states).

More than likely Foxs ability report and operate (effectively) in France is what would be effected, with broader implications in the rest of Europe which is why they were so quick to come out with that apology last weekwhich you never EVER see them do in the US even when theyve been proven patently wrong in their reporting by THEIR OWN news reporting, sometimes.

Britain and Birmingham was probably never going to suedespite Rupert Murdochs shaky relationship with the government there over the phone hacking scandal, due to similar high standards for libel suits (which is why the tabloids there put the US Tabloids to shame), and also because Murdoch has a lot of connections (read: business interests) there, but the situation is vastly different in France.

 If a group of people collectively chooses not to hang out with you, that should be a major red flag about how you interact with them. 




 Black Mirror! It's so good that sometime's its hard to watch. 




 Learning how to read poetry. I never understood how to follow along with the abstract line breaks until my teacher told us to follow the punctuation. 




 I was walking down a couple of steps leading into my garage while carrying two large jugs of wine (one in each hand) and I slipped and fell down the steps. One of the jugs hit the ground and shattered.

 




 Please don't ever workout in the sauna. I saw a man once doing a stretch workout in a SPEEDO while in the sauna. I saw more of him than I cared to. 




 What next? A kamikaze hooveround?

 No boobs, but instead a penis. 




 Picking their noses while driving. I've seen you, you've seen me. 




 I do this too, but mostly on my forehead so I can breathe. 




 When i was a kid, i used to sleep with my knees up and one leg crossed over the other. It kind of looks like I'm sitting but laying down at the same time.

He looks like a yeti, but has the voice of an angel. 




 The Red Wedding in Game of Thrones. I never read the books, so when it happened I felt the world crumbling around me.
