 The fact that there are lobbies dedicated to both playing as a team and playing as a singular entity would suggest the idea that the developers did mean for the concepts I'm arguing for to be the appropriate terms of playing. 

There are a ton of factors to count in, seeing as it's a new game that is exponentially growing in popularity, so accounting for all current and foreseeable issues in the game is going to be near a impossible task. So referring to the mechanics of the game, such as the "w" feature would make for an unstable ground to stand on as changes everyone can safely assume that the game is going to undertake several changes in the near future. That, and the W feature is both a weapon and a tool that can be used to ally. 

I do agree that temporary alliances are by all means justified as a means to overthrow someone of larger power, but you can't deny that permanent alliances, be they founded in the game, or premeditated (the $ clan comes to mind) do make for a pretty unfair and hardly enjoyable experience for the rest of us who are trying to play the way the lobby dictates we should. 

That's where my original point comes back. If you want to form bonds and work as a team to overthrow larger targets, then play in the team lobby where players are expecting that kind of imbalance. Leave the free for all lobby to the people who are trying to survive by themselves by whatever means they can. 
  




 So it's just for the novelty of acquiring friends in an unlikely environment? I appreciate the kind of satisfaction you must find from that, but it can still be argued that it's immoral to purposefully team up with someone in a game lobby where players are explicitly deciding to play every man for themselves.
It's the classic "my needs are greater than your needs" complex, but the satisfaction of the few "unfair" players hardly outweighs the satisfaction the players who are being cheated out of the game style their suggested.  




 Do you actually do this? 
I don't get the chance to ask in the game, so I'll ask now. 
Why don't you just play teams instead? 




 Go play teams. That's what it's there for.
It makes the game so frustrating to be swallowed by people who just team up on you and feed each other when necessary.

Also, I can't be the only person who specifically targets players with the name "Team? = W" can I?
