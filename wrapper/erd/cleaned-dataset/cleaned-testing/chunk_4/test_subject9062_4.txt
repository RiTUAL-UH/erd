 Meanwhile t[hey tell children to throw cans at shooters to protect themselves.](http://www.wjbf.com/story/27843713/students-told-to-throw-cans-at-a-shooter)  














 This is one of the weakest arguments I've heard. It makes no sense. The fact that there are drunk drivers has never been used as an argument to do away with laws against driving under the influence. The fact that people rape is not a case for making rape legal. What about domestic abuse? Fact is, people will abuse their spouses. Criminals don't follow laws. Should we make it legal to punch your wife in the mouth because, shoot, people are gunna do it anyway? 

When I encounter someone using this type of "reasoning", all I learn about them is that they've never been intellectually challenged and likely have no idea what debate team was in high school.  






























































































 Much of America agrees with you. However we have a broken electoral system and a gridlocked system of center-right democrats and fourth-reich republicans. The NRA owns the republicans and many of the democrats too; the fact that we allow unregulated and unreported and virtually unrestricted financial lobbying and donating to the electoral system by groups like the NRA means that our votes, our letters, our protests are being virtually ignored. Follow groups like

and many more to see how many Americans are truly working to change this. I'm sure our country looks crazy as fuck from the outside but many of us just want to know we can send our children to kindergarten and get them back alive with no bullet holes. And personally as a mom, I don't feel that way at ALL. My own parents are older and they discuss our entire family leaving the US. It's absurd.  




 And yet everything they are saying about this family in articles is that they are a "gun family" - shooting ranges, guns with them on every outing. Scary to think these *are* experienced gun folks. They're just so comfortable with the weapons that they have a false sense of safety. It's like carrying a vial of ebola virus around. Ticking time bomb that could kill any of us.  




 Fairly sure the three older siblings who witnessed it will end up cluing him in. All four kids witnessed the shooting. From the articles I've read it sounds like there are guns everywhere in this family. Hoping law enforcement at the very least removes the guns from the home, since they clearly put the children at risk.  




 It's abhorrent. As a parent in the US, I am uncomfortable sending my child anywhere without a drastic change to our lack of gun regulation. We lose an average of 82 citizens a day to gun violence. 

[Each year, more than 30,000 Americans die in gun suicides, homicides, and unintentional shootings as a result of the ready availability, and accessibility, of specific classes of firearms. Gun violence is more than a crime issue; it is a broad-based public health crisis of which crime is merely the most recognized aspect.](http://www.vpc.org/aboutvpc.htm) 




 Yeah, anything Ferguson or gun related gets attacked by the KKK on reddit.  









 Now I'm making the same expression Plaid Jimmy is.

 Grounsell said there will be no charges in the accidental shooting.

**"accidental"**

We fail these dead children every time we don't charge a parent.  














 Vetri Ferman said the victims were Nicole Hill, Stone's ex-wife; Patricia Flick, Hill's sister; Flick's husband, Aaron; the Flicks' 14-year-old daughter, and Hill's mother and grandmother.

...

Another neighbor, Ashley Deane, heard the same noises, likening them to a car or truck hitting a house.

She said she heard what sounded like four gunshots and could hear children screaming for their mother.

Deane said she could hear Stone telling the children that they had to leave. She said she looked out the front window and could see him with the children, who were in their pajamas.

Deane said Stone looked at her and said, "She's hurt," referring to his ex-wife. Stone and the children got in a car and sped off.

This kind of shit should not be happening to children. 
From another article, 
["They've been fighting for years, real bad," a neighbor, Michele Brewster, told the Allentown Morning Call. "He's been tormenting her. She's gone to the police, and she has told everybody, 'He's going to kill me.'''](http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-pennsylvania-manhunt-20141216-story.html)

It will be interesting to see the fallout from this case, to learn how someone with a record of threatening to kill his ex-wife and mother of his daughters was able to access a firearm. Accountability.  









 Exactly. No charges filed, most likely. And often, no guns removed from the home! Fucking absurd. KKK/NRA 




 People with guns.  














 The only thing causing shootings is the presence of guns and the inevitable combustion with human emotion.  




 No, that's why we have registration, inspection and insurance for cars, right?

Clearly, it's much worse than HIV. Doctors should lobby for gun control like Australia has, for starters. We are all paying for this scourge.  




 We need electronic tracking of ammo, not just sales.  




 

Police said the boy may have mistaken the gun for a toy.

* Like police only in reverse!  









 Upon searching for the gun, it could not be located. Officers also searched for a shell casing from the fired weapon, but again turned up empty handed.

No charges have been filed.

Un. Fucking. Believable.  



















 **Between January 2009 and July 2014, there were at least 110 mass shootings in the U.S. Not all of them make headlinesand the story the data tells is different from the one that mass media would have you expect.**

Using FBI data and media reports, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of every identifiable mass shooting between January 2009 - July 2014. There were at least 110 mass shootings.

**The Washington gun lobby claims that areas where gun-carrying is restricted - gun-free zones - cause mass violence rather than reduce it.**

Our analysis show this is not the case: an overwhelming majority of mass shootings take place in private homes where gun carrying is unrestricted, and less than one in six incidents took place in a so-called gun-free zone.

**Perpetrators of mass shootings are not the people you expect.**
The press often focuses on the mental health of the shooters, but our analysis shows that only 10% of perpetrators exhibited signs of mental illness that were reported to a doctor or other authority figure prior to the incident.

**Perpetrators of mass shootings are generally older than perpetrators of gun violence in the U.S. as a whole.**

Whereas FBI data shows that the median age of gun murderers in the U.S. is 26, the median age of perpetrators of mass shootings was 34.

**Domestic violence is a factor in the majority of mass shootings.**

In 57% of incidents, the shooter killed a current or former partner or family member.

**51% of mass shooting victims are women.**

In contrast to gun violence generally, perpetrators of mass shootings disproportionately target women. Whereas only 15% of total gun homicide victims are women, 51% of mass shooting victims are women.

**High-capacity magazines put the mass in mass shooting.**

When perpetrators used high-capacity magazines or assault weapons likely equipped with them, they shot 159% more people resulting in 65% more deaths.
 



















 An analysis of mass shootings, defined as those in which at least four people were killed with a gun, conducted from January 2009 to July 2014 by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety found that of 110 mass shootings, at least 63 of the cases, 57 percent, were related to family or domestic violence. In at least 20 incidents, the shooter had a prior domestic violence charge.

Dee Price Childers, a volunteer with the West Virginia Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a division of Everytown for Gun Safety, released a statement on the Monongalia shootings. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of yesterdays mass shooting in Monongalia County, she said.

This terrible tragedy is yet another reminder of just how easy it is for convicted felons to get their hands on deadly weapons thanks to background check loopholes in federal and state law  and just how often domestic violence turns into deadly gun violence.

 



















 The condo is owned by 46-year-old Jon Holzwarth. An internet search revealed he is in the internet security and firearms businesses.

No one answered at Holzwarth's door where a sign reads: "We don't dial 9-1-1" with a metal cutout of a pistol dangling below.

There were also emblems about guns on his Jeep.  














 * Recognizing the role that assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines played, the authors said Lanza's easy access to them "cannot be ignored as a critical factor in this tragedy." The ready availability of assault weapons in the U.S. is an important public health issue, they said.
* Lanza's "severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems" were combined with a preoccupation with violence. With access to deadly weapons, this "proved a recipe for mass murder," the report concludes.
* The report questions whether Lanza's race and privileged socio-economic status impacted how he was treated. "Is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision-making of white, affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority?" the report asks.
 









 I'll go with the right to live and be educated over the right to kill. Every. Fucking. Day.
The NRA is public enemy number 1.  



















 Ugh. RIP to your brother. 3 




 Oh man. That's the best - so hilarious!!! Eldest here, so I've been on the other end of a ruse or deuce.

 Sorry, that's shitty And sad.  




 Oh fuck! 




 YES. what the fuck are we doing accepting this shit? If the GOP is going to get off their asses and do Anything now that they snorted enough Koch to be in power, they can start by putting the profiteers in prison and handing back all that fat cash to the folks screwed by the thievery.  




 If Jaime Dimon doesn't get prison, we haven't seen Justice.  




 Everybody remembers how Occupy were a bunch of fuckups though! Media matters, and people ARE sheeple. Just sayin.  




 Rubbish.  




 :True 




 Could be anything from a prank to attempted murder.  




 Why can't that fucker fall off a cliff? Ted Cruz is beyond douchebag.  




 Absolutely. Let's support Obama's call for this. This is our internet, and once they make it a tiered corporate system, it will never go back. Preserve net neutrality now, or never.  




 Obviously those shot should have defended themselves with AKs - unless the Toddlers had AKs, in which case nuclear weapons are acceptable.

 Ah, an everlasting GOPstopper! 





























 I heard the gun go off and saw his middle finger hanging by a string, she said.

Canseco shot his middle finger on his left hand.


It will either have to be amputated or have full reconstruction surgery," Knight said.

Doctors already told the couple Canseco will never have full use of his hand again, Knight said.
