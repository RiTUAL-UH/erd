 I've never hired a prostitute but I'm working on a short story which requires it so here we are. 

My assumption is that maby sex workers would be bored and do a bad job hiding it or they'd try too hard to be pleasant. Which of these is more accurate (if either of them is true to life at all.)   




 That was actually The Island of Dr. Moreau. Also supposedly he got some police transmissions and such during takes and in the middle of a line would say things "there's a robbery at Woolworth's."

For Apocalypse Now, he's clearly adlibing. In the outtakes he says things like "I can't make up any more dialogue for today."  









 Eh, it's not that cool. It really has to stretch for some of the shots.  




 Those British forts look really cool. Yeah, I guess it would be creepy to spend the night in them, but that's true of any abandoned isolated building.  




 I thought for sure you were going to show a mashup video.  









 People just won't stop telling Bradbury he's [wrong about his book](http://www.factfiend.com/ray-bradbury-told-interpretation-book-wrong/).  




 Are you looking for other jobs?  














 For example, I read this article about Clerks: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239

And I must admit that even though I'd seen the movie before, I'd never thought about it the way he put it. I'd also never heard anyone call the movie on that before either. Do you have any examples that come to mind?  














 He can play timid very well. See "The King of Marvin Gardens."  




 How much sexism have you experienced in this field?  









 Gritty? Pure comedy? Fluffy? G or PG? Do they go on an adventure or is it more lowkey? What's your preference?

 Is this some of that rape culture I've been hearing so much about?  




 I think this is a really great cover for Gerald's Game: http://officialmattroberts.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/geralds-game-cover.jpg

This rerelease one strikes me as kind of silly: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sph-E-jJmL4/UORwT_63WBI/AAAAAAAAGKQ/PDBadysEhcI/s1600/GeraldsGame.jpg

Also, yeah, that pink cover for To Kill a Mockingbird is a bit of an eyesore.  




 Boy, I don't think Ford was the lynch pin for Blade Runner in the slightest. Really, I think Deckard is the least compelling part of that movie.  




 Okay, I am in talks with the [White with Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl4kgoeSbNo) director to adapt a short story. It's tentatively entitled "Please God" but that may change. 
[Here's the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY)

TL:DW: a guy wakes up in a room strapped to a bed. Someone comes in and tortures him purportedly because he was having an affair with the wrong person's wife but actually because this is the torturer's fetish and the tortured person is indulging him because he thought this would be the ultimate act of love. 

So, which of these approaches would you recommend: 

A. Prolonged POV shots (Not a gopro, I think those tend to shake too much to properly simulate vision) to make it more immersive. 

B. With conventional multiple camera setups because then people pay less attention to how the video is being shot and more to the story and acting. 

Thank you for your time.

 Nah, people could probably still say what they thought of the game into a webcam. I meant if every major let's player was hit with third party content matches or copyright strikes.  




 Oh dear. I just realized I still kinda dislike Pearjack for that time she narced on Fluttershy. I am clearly a bit fucked in the head.  




 I understand this is borderline out of the question unless I guess some company thought they could knock out the big names and replace them with their own to make the games essentially long ads. I guess it's more about whether you really need that footage of gameplay to really know how good a game is. 

Personally speaking I've never really just rushed out and bought a game on the basis of a Let's Play video versus a written review or a trailer, but this isn't about me.   




 I ask because it remains probably my favorite single fanwork even though I'm a little too young for the kind of games it's an homage to. I think it balanced the storytelling and gameplay just right and its rudimentary graphics are much more evocative than they reasonably should be. 

But has the fandom at large just sort of lost interest? 




 Hey! Watch it Pinkie! He ruined causality to get into a relationship with Twi, so don't you try to edge in on that! 




 I guess there's the Up series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Series.  




 Gonna make a Thneed out of it?  




 I have a manuscript I kind of set aside for awhile which I took a look at again and now feel might have potential, but I want a second opinion and to get the thing in shape to show to a potential agent. 

I know it will probably cost me over a thousand dollars to do this, but that's not really a problem.  




 You know what's really funny about that? A year or two ago, Wong said in the "Writer's Workshop" (a subforum for writers to pitch ideas to each other) that if Cracked ever became the kind of page that had to run that kind of clickbait at the bottom of articles, he'd quit writing for it.  




 You know why the pop culture stuff is so much better? Because it's just taken from TvTropes. 

Seriously, I used to write for the site and I saw people blatantly group together lists taken from Tropes and WMG pages.  




 Any man who must say "I am the director" is no director.  









 British hearts don't melt, or there'd be nothing left.  




 This might just be a related question, but isn't there a relatively big Brony community in Russia?  




 If I lived in Finland, I'd view everything as cancer just to make life interesting.  




 Taken from username Cookie Monster's comment on an article about the movie: 

"One more thing that make Star Wars work so well, that only just occur to me for first time, is that it not try and shoehorn in romance. Luke and Han both flirt with Leia, but story never about one of them getting girl. Leaving that storyline to Empire Strikes Back work well, because second installment not have to do as much world-building and have room for romantic subplot. But it also make Leia something other than prize for hero to get at end of movie. When she and Han do get together, they on equal footing, because first movie already establish her as independent person.
(This is also one of many things Guardians Of Galaxy successfully copy from Star Wars template)"

 I've plowed my way through a few books by Sandra Brown, who's had more than [sixty bestsellers](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/09/27/a-conversation-with-north-texas-best-selling-author-sandra-brown/) and I'm amazed at how terrible she writes female characters as being. They're either explicitly made to be unintelligent and loose or repressed and boring, particularly the ones in Seduction by Design.  I believe I've seen a couple of hers fail the Bechdel test, even. 

Have you ever found this with some other female authors?

 "We're gonna make those damn Johnny Rebs shit themselves when we come for them! Unfortunately it will mean we can't fire upon them."  














 I didn't mean they'd necessarily ship two background characters, just that there'd be a same sex couple. Probably one made specifically for the episode.  




 So really badly animated and pixelated in the sheets?  




 This OC is all wrong. That mane is supposed to be red! 




 I was bullshitting with my brother about the show while we were doing an errand and we mentioned the whole "Lyra/Bon Bon" thing. He wondered if you could show like a same sex couple in the show. Not something like it's central to the episode and it becomes a very special episode which would bore the shit out of kids, but they're just there and maybe they've adopted a kid or something. 

On that note, since there are a lot of conservative parents out there that watch the show, are there any controversies like that or was it only the Brony thing that kicked up any dust?  




 I saw [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/V0BaBCw.jpg) and I became curious if there has been someone who made a good faith attempt at what she argues. I know it's a joke, but maybe an eccentric rich person or particularly hardline activist might have taken the notion at face value.    




 Has anyone ever donated land to Native American tribes?  




 You introduce a neat notion like that into my life and then crush it instantly? Why are you taking me on this emotional roller coaster?! 




 That's not very nice.  









 But my fanon says that whenever you cover a unicorn's horn their magic stops working!  









 A comment on that I'd particularly like to draw everyone's attention to from The Cookie Monster:

 Still a good escape from being depressed about more worthwhile things.  




 I dunno, is time cyclical?  









 It's not about being "funny." It's about a repetitive format because that is reassuring and gives people's lives constancy and making obvious jokes because people will think "Hey, I thought of a joke like that! That means if this channel is funny, I am funny!"   




 And now you're doing it.  









 I wouldn't have it any other way.  









 I meant the MLP movies. Yeah, the Transformers movie is pretty good.  




 Last time I used my horn for this, I ended up burning my magic.  




 Nah. Too much actual animation to be like Firth's tedious vids.  









 No way Tirek's the most recent, he's from a previous Gen.  




 Sucks. That stupid "I thought I heard a robot" twist in the Balloons story is hilarious.  









 Pinkie, if I liked the moving around, as you do when you party, I wouldn't have become a security guard.

 So now clickbait=any article on a popular subject?  




 
I saw Sarah and heard her many times before I believed she could be real. She hid in shadows, edges, and in corners of my vision. I would hear walking quietly and cautiously around the house at night--breathing, crawling through the attic, everywhere. Sometimes she would shriek or weep for some time. Everytime I saw her, she was carrying some kind of stuffed animal with her. She was here when I moved into the house. Shell be here as long as the house stands, perhaps longer. 

I know why Sarahs here. I learned about it by reading up on my home at local history at the library. What I read in this old newspapers... well, I had thought I experienced a bad childhood, but compared to hers mine was idyllic. Her father would be revealed by a postmortem to have suffered from a brain tumor at the time when he went mad. His madness drove her mother to leave the home, and he seemed to direct his rage towards his own body and her. She was not allowed to leave the home for her last few days as he became obsessed with a butcher knife. He apparently found many occasions to use it on her and himself. . 

Her life ended in something Ive seen reenacted many times now. On the last night, holding her stuffed bear to give her courage, she walked out into the hallway, a cut on the back of her hand opening as she squeezed it. She went to ask her father to let her leave the house. He must have gotten up and killed her then, because when this part of the haunting happens, she falls on the floor and begins to bleed out. 

I first saw her... reliving this experience that I finally believed she was real. When I saw her walk in to the living room that night, she was not a mere ghost of light or smoke. She was as physical as I was, though I still dont understand how that was possible. She was looking off to my left as she begged her father to let her leave even though I didnt see any sign he was present. 

I let this happen to her once. The second time she came down the hallway to beg the empty air to let her leave. I yelled at her to run but she didnt seem to acknowledge me. When she stopped her plea, which meant her death was imminent. I ran over, picked her up without thinking about the implications of what it meant, and carried her away.

I was expecting what I did to mean nothing: That she would just bleed and die in my arms again. But apparently, somehow, moving the body she had beyond reason from the room prevented her from dying again. I put her down in the bathroom and she was looking up at me, still alright 

I can hardly claim to be her savior, though. Shes still dead. A short time after I carried out of the living room, she still faded away and resumed the same pattern of haunting the house, even the part involving walking into the living room to ask her father to let her leave, as if nothing had happened. Well, almost. 

Just an hour ago, she came into the living room again, looking the same as always and holding a stuffed animal the same as every other time. She looked like she was strangling it. I had moved the chair to where her father must have had his, and she looked me in the eyes as she approached. 
	
Hello, Sarah, I said as I got up. 	

No. Please, no, Sarah begged as I approached. 

Theres no one but me who has to see her. Theres almost no one who would believe this pretty little girl is still on this plane of existence. No wonder I didnt believe she was real. 

How could I be so lucky?


 




 What's weird is that Elsa isn't really growing up in that image. She'd abandoning adult responsibilities.

 Watching a clip of one of those, I thought for sure they were direct to video or TV movies.  




 I saw this a few years ago and the only thing I remember about it is the "You gotta be kidding me" face that Ve Soto makes when confronting his wife and lover in the swamp and they start making excuses.  









 Poor Applejack!

Was that the reaction he was going for? 




 That looks like a mob hit.

 I'd guess I'm a 9. I have no reason to be depressed except for the weather, I'm not rich enough where I don't have to work, and I'm not famous.

 http://listverse.com/2014/11/10/10-curious-facts-about-charlie-chaplin/

Some of these are more obscure than others. I think my favorite is the thing about how there were a bunch of fake Chaplins. Kinda interesting how these days you see knockoffs of popular movies like Transmorphers and Kiara the Brave but back then it was about counterfeit actors.  




 NO ONE DAMAGE THIS APPLE!

Seriously, I have a weird thing where if there's a specific bit of food like a melon or whatever that a character is invested in, I hate to see it damaged. It bugged me in MLP when that happened to AJ's apple and when it happened to Gromit's marrow.  




 Why? Bears really aren't what comes to mind looking at this.

 Shame that Mansfield wasn't able to make a viral "Ten Minutes of Sitting at a Table with Sophia Loren" video and expose the objectification she experienced during that encounter.

 I know a lot of people warn the younger folk to leave this subreddit and things like that, but I genuinely enjoy reading comments and such on here. It's the subreddit where I don't feel a need to posture as a more normal and clever person than I am, where I can let it slip that I'm totally kissless, yadda yadda. 
 




 I wonder why don't you see this more often. 









 Because I mostly read positive stories in terms of filmmakers making financially successful films against all odds, I was curious if anyone has a particularly bad story of a movie just ruining everything for the people that made it. 

All I have is one my professor told me about that he had a friend who shot a movie on 35 MM independently. When it was finished, the friend wasn't willing to show the movie to anyone else, never mind seeking distribution for it.   




 I know his horror stuff is generally considered at best hit-and-miss, but I just listened to an interview he did with Kevin Pollak's Chat Show and if nothing else, the story behind the making of Cabin Fever is fascinating. I imagine if he wrote out and edited his thoughts it could very well be one of the most fascinating stories in the history of movie making, or at least in the top half.   














 Probably Breaking Bad. But that's because the only other shows I've watched in their entirety are The Wire and Oz. I'm not a completist.  




 I knew someone who complained about Taxi Driver because she said the soundtrack reminded her of The Dark Crystal. The fact Taxi Driver came first by like a decade didn't matter to her.  









 I was watching a Let's Play video of Ethan Carter and was really stunned by the graphical quality of the portion on the bridge over the river. While I saw some things that in hindsight were very well-designed such as A Link to the Past and that sort of thing, it never really leapt out at me as beautiful-looking or what not. 

I didn't ever play it as a child, but I was surprised when I looked back on it at how well the graphics of The Curse of Monkey Island held up when I tried them a little while ago. I also liked some of the stuff in King's Quest V more than I would have expected for how primitive it is and for how difficult some of the gameplay can be.  









 There's cute, and then there's just showing off.  




 I was watching Robocop (80s version) for the first time. There's the character of Bob Morton who is presented as this complete sleaze, a really lame guy when he tells Murphy "You are gonna be a bad motherfucker!" and all that, but towards the end, I kind of found myself liking him anyway even though he was clearly supposed to be unlikable and usually I wouldn't like a character of that type. It was odd. 

Ever felt that?

 I and a guy in Las Vegas are in preproduction on a short based on this story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY (with permission from the author)

The TL:DW of it is that the story is about a guy being tortured because he had sex with the wrong guy's wife. 

Now, if it were your job to shoot this, would you take: 


Option A: Shoot it conventionally with closeups, fairly conventional shot lengths, etc. 

Option B: POV shots from the victim's perspective, ideally only two of them if possible. 

I imagine I don't need to go into any details about the pros and cons of each option.

 I'm still a fan of their comedy style, but while I was watching their track for The Dark Knight, I honestly decided about a quarter way through to just turn theirs off and just watch the movie. There are flaws to be found in the movie, but I believe it's well enough made that even the jokey nitpicks aren't very entertaining.  









 Pretty easy when you give the cat that slow-motion handicap.
