This guy has it at 600 




 I will feel bad for opening mine if so. O.O 




 :D Congratulations! 




 And great! I've had mine since it was ING. 




 Could be an unauthorized port or something completely ridiculous like a crappy game with a new sticker. *shrugs* 




 Many people also decorate their magic bands themselves. I plan on making a Frozen one! :D 




 *heavy breathing* 




 Your buddy is an alcoholic. The very best thing you can do for him is to get him the help he needs (which he probably won't want). Do it for his kid. 




 Wilhelm scream, anyone? 




 Rebels has enough in it for us "big" kids. Give it a shot. 




 I hear good things about Star Wars weekends at Disney.

Found a 3-D printed one on Etsy. Definitely unlicensed, but only 100. 




 I think it has more to do with certain State fans thinking their football program was better because it jumped to FBS after one season. We never played each other until 2014 and apparently that made us Eagles look like we were 'scared.'

This was then further exacerbated by clueless announcers calling Georgia Southern Georgia State on multiple occasions. [Friendly PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y) 




 Disney has shown the Boba Fett portion of the Holiday Special at special character dining events at WDW. Stranger things have happened. 




 Sorry bud. 




 HAIL SOUTHERN 




 KICK TO WIN 




 Yeah, kickers are not usually sought after recruits with a tight scholarship budget. Fritz knew what we needed though. 




 I dont know if there will be a ramp-up to buying for Star Wars,' Iger said, with most merchandise tied to a film typically selling around its release.

LOL that's not how Star Wars works Bob. If you sell it, they will buy. 




 I'm excited. We have had a few seasons now where the kicking has not been stellar. I'm talking about regular missed PAT. 




 Hail Southern! We can kick football now! :D 









 Good to know, thanks. 




 I am going to try at Midnight EST, fwiw. 




 I already have an alarm set to remind me to try for lunch reservations for my trip. *fingers crossed* 




 The boat rides were my favorite part. Also the cute cute architecture! I also enjoyed how the bus stop was nice and shady. The Gurgling Suitcase bar was also very fun! 




 Adorable! 




 They look like tsum tsums! :D 




 Mine's 500, just like the student card I screwed everything up with. It's my second card ever, so that probably has something to do with it. 




 Capital One has some cards for rebuilding. My SO is helping me rebuild for the same reason. I got one (with a tiny limit) immediately approved from Capital One so now I can start on the right path. Good luck!

I also bank with Capital One 360, so this may have helped me out. YMMV 




 Well there goes that career plan, guess I'll just continue to focus on my PhD then. :o 




 I always thought it was Luke.

EU post movies Luke. Well, I guess we will see in VII :D 




 Oh I am so sad for you hun :( 




 Most good tea shops will have some form or another of a house brand Moroccan Mint.  




 So if FDOT needs to hire archaeologists to check the area before they begin the project I will work for on-site room and board and weekend park tickets hehe. 




 Do you think I am defending her or something? I am confused as to why you are taking this so personally. 




 Thank you for dramatically correcting my opinion of a person neither of us know anything significant about beyond OP's post. I really appreciate your guidance. 




 No, but that's where it began. She found out something she didn't like about her boyfriend and let it fester until she did something drastic instead of talking to him about it and letting him know how she felt and also trying to see his side of things. I agree that it is a selfish way to be. 




 Coming from a chick here- She's overreacting and does not know how to communicate about what bothers her on an adult level.

Sure it hurts you now and don't let anyone tell you it shouldn't because that's an important part of the healing process. But you will be much happier being with someone who respects you more than that. 




 Good advice. I definitely think the breakfast will be one of the highlights of our trip. Getting the TS Fastpass sounds like the safe option! Thank you! 




 I'm sorry to hear that! I think I have been convinced to get the TS FP! 




 Thank you! Y'all have convinced me! 




 I really appreciate your in-depth reply. I would be more upset missing TS than RnRC, not sure how my SO feels though. It sounds like I should stick with Toy Story! :) Thanks! 




 Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.

We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it). 

What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you! 




 You can team up with a partner on Star Wars: The Old Republic. My boyfriend and I are paired up and playing through the Knight/Consular story lines together. It's awesome and you get two story lines at the same time. We also have a Bounty Hunter/Imperial Spy game going. 




 If your party likes movies/Star Wars/Pixar/Muppets then HS. Epcot for international flair! Shopping, food, and awesome fireworks.  




 Thanks! 




 Crossing my fingers for May... 




 Etsy is great too. I just got a set of Chewbacca ears there. Find a seller who makes ones you like, then ask if they will do a custom order. 




 The only special thing is that HS has tiers for their fast passes, so you can only make reservations for one A ride and 2 B rides. 

Toy Story Mania and Rockin Roller Coaster are both A.  




 Sorry to hijack but do you know when Pirates will be down? Thanks. :( 




 That's pretty much how Teavana makes their money.
 




 The first time I saw it it started just as we were getting to MK from Epcot after watching Illuminations and we saw part from the Monorail and that was awesome! We watched the rest from the plaza near the ticket center. 




 Or crepes...
