 Yeah, the difference in controllers were because of different [regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System.2FSuper_Famicom) 




 Actually, it's "R" and "ZR", not "Z1".  But still no R1 either. 




 With the strength of 5 gorillas! 




 No it isn't, but Miracle Whip is.  Next question. 




 If it was a Buffalo Wilds Wings commercial then they forgot to make the game go into overtime. 




 All that technology, but they can't put arm rests on the seats? 




 The only flaw in your argument is that the top and bottom of the stall are open to release the gasses you speak of.  Therefore, the crack is not necessary. 




 So who else wanted to click on the OK button? 




 So why did the Wii's price inflate by $35 since launch, but the PS3 deflated by $30 when they were lanched 2 days apart from each other? 




 Ohio State does that. 




 That's why Harry and Lloyd drove across the country in Dumb and Dumber.  Much cheaper. 




 I like to think of Jesus as little baby Jesus. 




 At first I thought it was just a fat co worker going to get some food.  Then I later learned of the real danger I was actually in. 




 And I got mad when my brothers messed up a box that the N64 game was kept in. 




 There could be anything in the mystery box.  It could even be a boat!  You know how much we've wanted one of those! 




 The Big Lebowski, actually twice.  Dude - "I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off."  And again the Dude - "I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

 









 Thanks, I'll try there! 














 Oh sure George Costanza, always leave on a high note! 




 Would you like some gum to make you feel better? 




 I have the copier room to duck off to in my office.  If people are in there I just act like I'm looking for something that printed, then seemed baffled when my paper didn't print for some reason. 




 I loved Burn After Reading.  But several of my friends watched it and just said it was dumb and won't give it another watch through.  Because I think this is a movie that needs to be seen more than once in order to get everything. 




 I love this movie too!  Even my brother who doesn't care for Star Wars gave it a watch and he enjoyed it too. 









 Wait a second.  How did you take a picture of the chair full of clothes if you are asleep? 




 I am guessing he just painted those games.  But I don't think he said for sure. 




 In the original post he states that they are actually all old sports games and they printed off labels of the games you see.  Otherwise this would be tragic to waste that many copies of a good game. 




 I always thought loading bars were to let you know how much time you had to drink until the game was ready to play? 




 I think guys standards go down with age.  This therefore makes the attractive girls looks that much better in perspective. 




 I think so.  Maybe someone should combine the two movies and see what happens with no sight or hearing. 




 Some others I can think of would be:
Clerks 1 and 2,
BASEketball,
Ghostbusters,
Tremors (only the first one),
Big Lebowski,
See no Evil, Hear no Evil,
UHF,
American History X 




 This works until they are digging through dumpsters for bottles and half the trash ends up outside of the dumpster by the time they are done. 




 So you've seen the movie even though it hasn't been released yet?  How is this possible? 




 I hate to say it, but I kinda agree with you. 




 Nope, not Brandon. So you can cross that name off your list of possibilities. 









 This is how I imagine it would be for me to try to get a decent picture of something while on the road. 




 I was just kidding when i worded it that way. 




 I'm not sure I can justify $4,000 just for karma on here. 









 A little anti-aliasing would help out his tie. 









 Am I the only person who actually kept my games in the boxes they came in? 









 Did he finally get arrested by the cop and is now sitting in jail? 




 I'd say it's a springboard from Portal 2. 




 Ha, thanks for the approval! 









 The question is, does he do this every morning too? 














 Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestar_Runner_Characters#The_Poopsmith) who you're talking about? 




 I'd say more like overly attached wife in 25 years. 




 I think it's the fact that as you grow up you actually expand your horizons. 




 That would seem like a simple choice.  The PS2 will play any PS1 games for you.  So why not save $10. 




 Well, you didn't want to leave a surface uncovered in case that was the one area you needed to place a portal. 









 Hope you brought an umbrella.  Otherwise the rain will get you all wet when you get out of the lake. 




 My name is Voit, dumbass. 




 Tommy Pickles?  Oh wait, wrong show. 




 And with the small trophy presentation have the Karate Kid music "You're the BEST aroooouuuund" playing! 




 I'm not sure if you spelled BLEEEUUUUUGHRRGHUUUUGUUHBL  correctly. 




 My dad is the janitor at my local high school.  For some reason he seems to be the favorite employee for almost all of the students.  He usually dones't say much and almost never smiles at people.  I ask others what makes my dad so likable, but they don't really have an answer.  But whatever it is, it seems to be working. 




 And so would your little sister. 




 Really?
