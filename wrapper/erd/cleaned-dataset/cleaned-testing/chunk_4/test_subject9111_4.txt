 I still think Mr. Green is behind everything. Maybe he killed his wife or maybe she really did commit suicide, Nicole doesn't give much detail about the wife, and consequentially whatever motives Mr.Green might have for killing her. However, either way it would be easy to find a motive for him killing all those high school girls. Plus he would have the strength, influence, and access to the school to pull off something like multiple murders of students at the school. As for Nicole missing, Mr.Green knows she is looking into the murders quite a bit, is somewhat estranged from her father who does happen to be an ex-cop, and she looks up to himself as an uncle. This would be the perfect opportunity to not only get rid of a possible future liability, but to also fulfill the the last letter of his wife's name. Most likely he completed the "ritual", for lack of a better term, at his house when she came over for tea. It sure doesn't seem like the authorities questioned him very well. I would say press harder on Mr.Green, he may be holding her for some reason, at the very least I believe he knows more than he is leading on. Good luck and I hope you find your daughter sir.
