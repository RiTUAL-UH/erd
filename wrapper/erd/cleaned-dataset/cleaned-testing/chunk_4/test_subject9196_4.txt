 Thank you! You are very helpful sir. Will take look at that and add it if it works. 




 Wait, in next version I will make 1x1, 2x2, 3x3. Hope it will help you. 




 Widget updates only once in 30 minutes (not to drain battery), so slowly disappearing, would be hard to do but will take that into mind. 




 Sorry, it needs 4.0 as below that there is a real mess with accessing/reading calendar events and for sure will have some problems - so I decided not to do it. 




 Seen, read, and that is awesome to hear that it seriously helps people.

I would say "enjoy app" but you certainly are. 




 No, it works on all 4.0. Somebody else have same issue - try reboot phone (yes, I know it is weird). 




 It is already available to download with sizes - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy!

About colors... wait and I will come back with some awesome customization.

 Zmniejszyem w aktualnej (1.9) wersji - 2x2 albo 3x3. 




 In few day I will post a version with such features and customization of them. So stay tuned. 




 That's a lot of text - I'll save it somewhere to read it on phone when on the bus or something. 




 Customization is coming, but Probably (at least in first update) outer ring won't be - only calendar colors, maybe background.

About tapping - working on it. Probably you would be happy.
 




 Sorry for copypasta but I would have to wrote it too many times today:
 "Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local google play servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones."

 




 Maybe... Who knows, I have to take a rest after correcting all bugs. Most likely I will just give a presentation at local (Warsaw) GDG meeting - if yes I will try to record it to share it. 




 Sorry to say, it is closed to devs (at least I don't a way to make it for Gear). Maybe Sony Smartwatch or Pebble. 




 Thanks, corrected it (I uploaded without noticing it) and now we have to wait till google play updates. 




 Sorry for copypasta mate but too many of you and I didn't slept in last 30h.
It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it. 




 Thanks! Haven't seen it but looks very interesting. Would do my best to make it work. 




 For now there is a list of 10 of them, and choosing at random - would be in 2.0 version - matter of 2-3 days. 




 You wouldn't believe how my calendar lately became full of events... mainly test ones, but hey! People looking at your homescreen would know that!

 There was a discussion in other comments, I have removed it, in 1.9 version (should be rolling out). 




 Damn, I didn't know it is there... Fixing it. Thanks.

 All credits with layout goes to Dawid Cielak, I just said that there need to be a ring with colors. 




 1) Yes it is a problem, probably I will go with making borders around each event, and smaller event will be on top. Not ideal but almost close to it.
2)Color sync is on its way. Title/description would be hard, and I don't have ready answer to that. 




 Make sure that in calendar that you choose there is some events in next 12 hours - add events before adding clock, as it updates only once in 30 min.

2. Will do, thx, I saw that but has forgotten.
3. Will change - in next versions there would be normal activity as there will be more options to set - customization! 




 It is known (to me) bug - apart for you nobody found it. So ssssshhh... *they don't know*. 
[Serious] I'm working on it. 




 Sorry for copypasta but it is post up:
"Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones." 




 Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones. 




 I have to do some mindstorming with friends/myself and see what is the best way to do so two buttons, or one configurable, we will see. 




 You should feel lucky - there is already uploaded update (version 1.9) with 2x2 and 3x3 widgets. You should be able to download it in 1-2hours.
