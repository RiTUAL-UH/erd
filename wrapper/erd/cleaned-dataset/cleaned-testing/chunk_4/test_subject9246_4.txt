 I'm graduating and leaving town, or I'd say I'd go. Are you working or taking classes over the summer? If so, you could ask coworkers or classmates to go. Make a few new friends :) 




 Shaving legs in the sink is doable, just not ideal. I'll try switching the water tomorrow when I shave to see if that helps. 

I have not used pre shave oil. 
 
I'm not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched, so I'm probably not doing it 100% the way it should be.

Update: using the lower faucet helped with the lather. Ended up knicking my underarm - trying to hold the razor, pull the skin, and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated.   




 None!? 




 Buy a tube or raft to go tubing down the river. Best free (aside from initial investment of tube and any alcohol you bring) thing to do on a hot summer day. 

This isn't on campus, but it is a fun thing to do during the summer in Mt. Pleasant.  




 I just started using DE razor and I use it in the shower, takes a bit longer but I think that's just because I'm still learning.  




 With the lather I think I just used too much water. I shave in the shower and it was easy to dilute the soap too much. 

Yes they were problem areas I had before. Issues with razor burn and irritation. 

Oh and I attempted to shave my underarms and I'm having trouble getting as close of a shave there, legs are much easier.  




 My list of things to try is expanding quickly, but I'll definitely add that to my list :)  




 I picked up some of that soap and I noticed a huge difference. :)  




 I bought some new soap and it definitely made a difference. I don't quite have the lather down. There are a couple areas that I'm having trouble getting a close shave with though. I still haven't cut myself yet, but I'm terrified of the day I do.  




 Try looking on Amazon. Also they are better if you leave them out and they get a little stale. 

Edit: After a quick search on my phone, it looks like peeps don't ship outside the US. Not sure on shipping regulations from the US to Australia, but you might be able to have someone personally ship you some. 




 I've lurked here awhile and did research on other threads and found Astra mentioned quite a bit my newcomers, so it seemed like the safe and logical choice to begin. Can I get Taylor of Old Bond Street cream in a store, or is it online only? Thank you! I stumbled across you guys a few months ago, and instantly became interested. I already can't wait for my leg hair to grow back so I can give it another go. :) 




 No worries, I'm posting in a man dominated subreddit. And this is the first time I've posted something and outted myself as female. So I would have assumed I was male as well. 

Thanks for the thought out reply! I'm nervous to try feathers because I've heard they are good, but also easy to cut yourself with. So far I like Astras, but I'm excited to see what else is out there and what works best for me. :)  




 Thanks! I tried to pay as much attention to what I was doing and what did or didn't seem to work. I had noise to a minimal so I could listen to how it sounded as I shaved. If I get razor burn in an area, how should I treat it differently the next time?


Edit: I actually don't have any hair on my face. I used the razor to shave my legs last night and this morning I used it on my underarms.  




 Thank you! I am in the US, I'll be sure to stop by Walgreens and pick some up to try. :)  




 First shave was pretty successful! Didn't get quite as close of a shave as I was hoping for, but didn't cut myself either. I'm sure with practice I'll get better. :)  




 Do you have a favorite? I purchased the razor, blades, and brush one at a time as I had the money, but I was impatient and just bought the soap I could find at Walmart.  




 I hadn't used it before and didn't realize until after I tried lathering that it wouldn't work. :(  









 As someone who digs through applications and hires new employees, if I had to do this it would take up my entire day. I get so many applications where I work, I can't even look at every single one. If you care enough about getting the job, give the company a call to check on your application, but don't be a pest about it.  




 I love your tagging system. I always buy books faster than I can read them, and then some get lost in the shuffle until months later I realize I still haven't read them. I may have to steal this idea. :)  




 There are several women over at /r/wicked_edge that have found a better way to shave.  




 Thanks! I'll try those. :)  




 I apologize for the misunderstanding. :)  




 I've been wanting to pick up drinking scotch. Do you have any recommendations on where to start? 




 You have too much good beer in VT to not keep trying. Here's a pointer to enjoying beer, I've found that when I pour the beer into a mug, it tastes better than in the bottle. Pour the beer just right so you get a bit of a head on top. Also, there is a wide variety of beers. If you don't like the taste of an IPA, you may enjoy a Porter more. Where I'm from, there are some stores that sell create-your-own six packs. I recommend finding one of those, and purchasing six completely different styles of beer. Try each one (not all the same night) so that you can see which ones you prefer. Keep note of what you do or don't like, and then you can ask for beers with similar tastes. 




 I love me a good beer. I'm currently visiting VT and there are some really good local beers I've stumbled across, but I still love me a pint of PBR on occasion. Everyone likes to bash it, but I think it's a good beer in it's own way.  




 That is extremely helpful. Thank you!  




 What's the best way to clean it? I've read a lot of people do a vinegar and water mix, is that a 1:1 ratio? Do you have any recommendations for blades?
