 As a genuinely curious male who doesn't know: what are the struggles of females in the dating world? 




 Classic Schmosby 




 Only 9 hours? You didn't watch the extended edition. For shame.  




 While any situation like this can absolutely be regarded as rape, I would like to tentatively suggest that he may not have considered it a negative experience had she been very attractive. 




 I doubt it.  




 Every suggestion in this thread is absolutely valid, but I've always found the best cure is to find someone else to think about. Not necessarily go out with etc, though that's great for you if you're ready for it, but find someone else to occupy your mind, wish you were with , want to talk to and so on.  




 Go for it! :) 




 despite the fact that I usually dress very well

I'm going to be a little skeptical, because this can be subjective. Perhaps she meant dress a little more *convemtionally* well? 




 Tbh, the dating system is MUCH easier for women than for men.  




 I literally cannot ever scratch anything in my mother's presence, because it means I must be sick or having an allergic reaction to something somehow. Apparently people don't just get itchy sometimes.  




 I decided something had to be done when my self esteem was so low and I was so worried what everybody thought of me that I started having severe panic attacks in public.  




 I'd be happier for people to be here than to have no community at all. 




 Seven years? I find optimism helps. 




 Comments like this are what give this subreddit a reputation for being breakup trigger-happy. 




 Gorgeous! I know it's totally up to you and your goals, but based on how much your face has changed, I reckon you're fine where you are :) 




 I'm glad you're recovering - things *will* get better for you. PM me if you ever need to talk.  




 Mate, that's amazing progress! Congratulations, you should be really proud of yourself!

I'm doing ok. Starting losing some weight - only two kilos down, but that's not so bad, as I only want to lose about fifteen. I was actually feeling on the way up for the first time in years before I got diagnosed - like I'd started the medication before getting the illness.  




 Thanks, you too! 




 I'm glad you feel better, and I hope it stays that way! I know the parents are just worried, which is why I'm trying to put up with it as much as possible. It's just awkward because if there's any reason I'm like this in the first place, it's probably them.

With regards to therapy, I'm actually being taught medical hypnosis at the moment - which sounds whacked, but you do it to yourself, and it's basically a kind of meditation where you combat low self esteem by convincing yourself that you're actually worthwhile and things like that. So far it's working.  




 It will get better. Trust me. No matter what happens, you will get through these exams and shit and into a brighter place. PM me if you need to talk it out any more, any time. Really. 

And I hadn't intended it to be, but I love that band and I love that song! Cheers brother! 




 It took me a while to realize they don't want help, they want the emotional support to enable them to help themselves.  




 Exactly right. Even though I'm relatively new here (been lurking for a bit), I think this subbreddit would benefit from a mentality of being a team where we can beat our problems together - *more* than just a place where we can talk it out (though that's great too). 




 I'm glad you're out of the relationship, and I'm glad you're washing the memories away with something tasty. Though whether you feel fine in the morning is yet to be seen :P

PM me if you ever need to talk.  




 Cheers! Good luck to you bud :) 




 It's weird how you take a kind of perverse pleasure in being depressed. It's one of the reasons I took so long to get diagnosed - you feel like its one of the few things you really enjoy. 

But you'll get back on your feet, and enjoying things the conventional way. Feel free to PM me any time :) 




 I struggled for a long time with the possibility that I might just have a severe case of Whiny Little Bitch Disorder, so to know that I'm not just an attention whore is nice. 

It also took a *long* time and the constant encouraging of some very helpful friends to get me to therapy at all. I just didn't want to take a step forward (though I didn't see it like that at the time). So I guess I have achieved something.  




 I'm glad you're making progress! The only way is up!

Ironically, I've been diagnosed at a point when I also actually feel on the uphill at last, as opposed to the usual low point when people finally see a doctor. It's quite weird, having almost received the medication a few months before the illness.  




 It's absolutely not your fault. At all. 

What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.  




 Bro, you're just at one those temporary low points that happen to everyone. The only way from here is up, and I'm sure you'll be right on top of it next week.  




 If he wants to fix things, it means he is concerned and he cares.  




 Actually, I would say shoulders first (if that) and waist a very close second. Compare the attractiveness of a man in a loose dress shirt and a slim fit dress shirt of the same size - equal shoulders, but one looks like a tent.  




 So basically, you want clothes that fit without actually changing what clothes you wear?

And it's male *fashion.* So it's going to be clothes that are fashionable. Like not tshirts.  




 How else is anyone supposed to address the gender as a whole? 

On that note, should we expect... that non-man gender to not use the word 'male?' 




 And this is precisely where the social pressure comes from. It's not your fault, but as soon as I read your comment I criticized myself for not having the moral strength and conviction that you do, and decided I should try to be more like it in the future, before realising I was perpetuating the stereotype.  




 What girls say they want a man to do with his emotions and what they *actually* want are two very different things. 

They want a man to open up about himself an expose his vulnerabilities. But they also want him to be a towering pillar of strength and self-confidence, because that's what's attractive. Lo and behold, when I try to express the fact that I'm actually not this ridiculously self-confident and completely emotionally self-reliant thing, they are gone in a flash.  




 Can you imagine it without the u and g? 




 Australian here: people who drive supercharged V8s like they own the place are generally shunned from society.  




 I was actually expecting 'listen when I'm upset and don't try to fix the problem' 




 everyone hates having me around them

As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. 

In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.  




 What are dad jeans? 




 I find that the fairly standard (as in not too experimental) outfits from /r/malefashionadvice go over well.  




 Apple in the mouth? 




 It is, because advise is a different word.  




 Do males who don't have a no-nonsense exterior still get points for being sensitive? I feel that I don't because I'm not all "manly man" and that being capable of communicating my emotions without being forced at gunpoint has made me unattractive.  




 Also centre. 

Are you sure about colourise? 




 I don't even know what she was trying to imply. That you actually molested the babysitter? 




 I %100 agree with what you just said, but how is it relevant to women being encouraged to compare their bodies to media figures more than men? 




 Yes, but males are taught to compare their ACTIONS to role models - being manly, successful, and rich - whereas women focus on their bodies. 

You rarely hear a woman say 'omg, I wish I had her personality.' 




 You're quite right. If you're attractive enough and you make an approach, a woman is very likely to succeed. 

It seems to me that women have the dating world much easier than men.  




 Women are very, very strongly encouraged by media and society to compare themselves to supermodels. Not so much for men.  




 This comment makes me sad.  




 I think it is much easier for women to be attractive than men.  




 The twist: he's been married for 15 years 




 I'm a fucking whale. 

(cries and reads weightless blogs) 




 You're not a cave man any more.  




 As much as I agree with you, please elaborate on why these things are incorrect. It is a thread for newbies, after all.  




 It's half advice and half bragging about how he's a "master seducer" with "over a hundred lays," "always hanging girls" etc etc. If there wasn't some fairly solid (if distastefully presented) advice in the post I'd suspect he was a fourteen year old virgin  




 Severely. I hate to say it, but to some people this community has picked up quite a bad reputation in other parts of reddit, and posts like this are what give it that reputation.  




 The extra room in the head creates more movement, friction with the glans, and thus pleasure. 




 Such as? We are in a thread for sharing for the unenlightened. 




 Also: magnum condoms are are wider, not longer. Most people do fit them, and they can increase pleasure quite a lot.

edit: to be precise, they are wider at the head. 




 Why shouldn't you do it with just anyone? It's not that special - as a matter of fact, it tends to suck for all parties involved - and is best gotten over with quickly so you can practice and actually make it enjoyable. 




 The pope agrees 




 dry humour

showers

I beg to differ. 




 Yeah, as great as this is for OP, it's much easier for him to move on because he knows his ex still cares about him.  




 Are the women you know anime schoolgirls? 




 But he was still PHYSICALLY attracted to you. He still would have banged you.
