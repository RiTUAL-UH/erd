 I still haven't seen anything on the London Riots, I would love to see a film from both the viewpoint of a Rioter   A Policeman. 




 If you haven't seen it yet, check out ["Hitler: The rise of Evil"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346293/) with Hiter being played by one of my favourite actors, Robert Carlyle. It follows Hitler from childhood right up to the early stages of WW2. 




 Thats fantastic
