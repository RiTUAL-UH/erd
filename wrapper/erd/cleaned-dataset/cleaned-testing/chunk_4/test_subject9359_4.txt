 does anyone else pull out there eyelashes? but tries to say I'm only doing it because i don't want my eyelashes to fall in my eye? 

i also have depression.  




 i have depression and i pull my hair. i haven't had any bald patches. i think my hair pulling is quite mild because i go for long times without doing it. then pull out loads in a few days. i haven't had any professional help about the hair pulling but i have for the depression.  




 i pull out my hair and i have so far not had any bald spots. i am 27. i think mine might be mild because i still have hair. 

i love cats too.  




 i have depression and borderline personality disorder.
any friends that i have i push away. i keep thinking everyone is out to get me and so i don't annoy them or bother them.
i recently unfriended everyone on Facebook. I've done it before. i used to have about 300 Facebook friends. then i had 150. then i had 100. then i had 90. then 40. right now its one person.
i don't have any friends in real life.
i have a boyfriend because i feel like i can only handle one person at a time.
