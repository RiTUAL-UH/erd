 Ensure made my teeth turn all dark and stained and then when I complained about it she said they were simply rotting due to my condition.

Went to my dentist, nope, they're just stained, and they were pissed off the dietitian hadn't said anything about possible staining.

Oh, and she tried to push me to 3,000 calories through the tube. I would have to be hooked up to it for *20 hours* at that amount. Not only did she want to make me hate myself, she wanted to take any form of a life I had at that point.
