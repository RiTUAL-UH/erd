 "You have violated my religious rights."

That is fucking absurd and everyone's reaction should be "that's fucking absurd." 




 I did not know this. Thank you. 




 I've never had any luck getting my phone to act as a wifi hotspot (but then again I'm not that tech savvy). 




 Nothing that is noticeable enough to come to mind. It does seem to hog the connection though, rendering tablets and other devices struggling to reliably connect. 




 Good point and I think you're right about that. I was primarily referring to travel where I stay with family and friends (I don't do much hotel traveling). 




 Yeah that was intense. 




 I have one on all TVs and am considering getting one for travel. They are pretty much an integral part of how I access my digital media: Netflix, HBOGo, Google Play Store, Google Music, YouTube, multiplayer games, Photos, etc. You can also mirror any Android device.

It's a luxury in the sense that it's not necessary or anything, but that can be said about most things we buy. Chromecasts are affordable and pretty awesome.

For $15? Go for it. 




 Hot cop is best cop. 




 I think that's the entire point here... if the first people to get here can't claim any right to the land, how can the European settlers? 




 O_O 




 Sweet. Let's turn Georgia into a mecca for marijuana and pass a joint all the way to the bank. 




 I don't think it's a stretch to compare social mobility in Western countries. America doesn't exist in a bubble. 




 He said it was supporting evidence, not sufficient evidence to prove it. Minor but important distinction. 




 I don't think I've ever seen the colored "2 days left" feature before. 




 That getting an indictment is easy if the prosecutor wants one. 




 Would diving through the wave even remotely work? It was fairly narrow. 









 This is my first experience with the actual hive mind. That was today, right?  




 I'm not basing this just on the President. I'm basing it also on *the Republican-led committees*. All *seven*. Not everything bad that happens is the result of ill intentions. Sometimes shit happens and mistakes are made. All evidence in this matter indicates that's exactly what happened here.

You're basing your position on your own assumptions, and that's it. 




 No they weren't. All an executive order is is a directive from the CEO (the President) to his employees (executive branch government employees). Nothing nefarious.

On the immigration issue, I'm not certain but I bet he's exercising prosecutorial discretion to tell U.S. Attorneys to stand down on certain deportations. And prosecutorial discretion is not a radical concept either.

Edit: For the downvoter...  An [Executive Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) apparently is not what you think it is. 




 Totally nothing to see here folks! 

You forgot your source: the Republican-led committee.

And again, why are you assuming the worst motive? Everything you wanted to be true about this conspiracy has failed to materialize. So why can't you accept the fact that you might also be wrong on this as well?

Is it because you've made up your mind and want to attack the President, facts be damned? 




 Yes, they do. When a government employee does something in their official capacity, they are generally held to whatever government standard is applicable.

And it has nothing to do with a chain of command to me as a taxpayer. It has to do with the government being required to follow certain rules.

Short of security concerns, the government generally cannot prevent the press from reporting on its activities. That may (or may not) be applicable here.

But the fact that they are government employees is extremely relevant. 




 Conflicting reports don't mean you have to sit on your hands and not make an assessment about what happened. That's what they did. No conspiracy. Get. Over. It.

And I'm relying on Republican-led committee reports. You are the one who refuses to change your mind in light of a massive amount of evidence suggesting you should. 




 Or they were just making their best assessment at the time given the information available.

Look, y'all have beaten this Benghazi horse to death and found nothing to support your crazy conspiracy theories. At this point, why insist on assuming the worst possible motive? Seven committee investigations now strongly suggest doing so is unreasonable. 




 I agree he's talking tough, but I'm skeptical whether he will follow through.

And Congress is undoubtedly more powerful than the President legislatively but that doesn't mean Congress should legislate in bad faith or that the President is powerless. If they try shenanigans (such as tacking a law to refund Obamacare onto a bill to fund the government) he needs to call their bluff. 




 Did you even read the article? The committee found that there were conflicting intelligence reports about the cause of the attack. 




 No matter how many times Benghazi is proven to not have been a scandal, you'll never let it go, will you?

Too much invested in it, I suppose. 




 While true, you will always run up against things like the First Amendment when dealing with the government.

They are customers, but they're also government employees. 




 So when you said we elect people based solely on merit, you meant "but only in the last few decades"? Doesn't seem as lofty with that qualifier (particularly because the same can be said with regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.) 




 As a liberal Democrat, I agree. Defense always loses.

Obama needs to respond with force. Start pounding the GOP in the media NOW and don't stop. Call their bluff and stand firm: your bad-faith legislation will be veto'd and you will shut the federal government down. 




 Isn't that the point? NOT to act like the psycho murderer? 




 You probably could have received the same deal, but you wouldn't have known to request it. One of the primary advantages of hiring an attorney is that you are hiring someone who is very familiar with the system and how to navigate it. 




 "Augusta was recognized in an annual survey by the Center for Digital Government, a California-based national research and advisory institute on information technology policies and best practices." 









 How on earth can you make such a statement based off one anonymous internet post?

You went from zero to drama queen... 




 You don't think gender plays a role in who we elect as President? Forty-four consecutive males is not statistically likely if the contests are truly blind to gender as you suggest. 




 Civil law judges are considered less powerful than common law judges. The roots of the French civil law system include a reaction to the powerful judges prior to the French Revolution who protected the aristocracy.

Importantly, civil judges generally cannot invalidate legislation. This alone makes common law judges much more powerful. 




 Is it what I'm thinking of? Overgrown and looking like something out of Walking Dead? 




 The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.

Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.

I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.

I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.

As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.

Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.

Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.

I love it here, and can back that up quite easily. 




 Do you mind being specific (as to "a lot to complain about" and "doesn't compare to many other cities this size")?

The tone of this post and your original one are quite different. If you agree about Augusta being an objectively nice place to live, why would you pity someone who is moving here? 









 Try Auben Realty for housing. They are local and do a great job.

For live music, Sky City will likely be your venue. Whiskey Bar, Stillwater, Craft   Vine, and Bee's Knees are a few of the great bars downtown (off the top of my head).

As for touristy stuff, there's the canal and the river. I personally love all things canal but you're arriving in the winter so it won't really be accessible for a few months. 




 OP, don't listen to folks like this. Augusta has a large melancholy band of pessimists that poop on everything about Augusta.

The area is objectively nice: good climate, good economy, cheap standard of living, access to outdoor activities, plenty of restaurants, etc.

Plus we just built the first new nuclear reactors in the country and are now the home of the U.S. Army's Cyber Command (fun tech development).

Welcome and I hope you enjoy our city! 




 If it's a jobs program, let's call it what it is. 




 I pretty much agree with your entire analysis but question where the line is. First Amendment freedom of speech is a political and legal right, and it should be.

Private freedom of speech can't be political or legal, or you quickly run into enforcement problems with the First Amendment.

So is it social pressure? That's seem to be all that it can be. And that is almost by definition lacking in consensus. But if there is consensus, like: Black people are worse than white people simply because they are black, can't a position win?

We value the free market of ideas *in search of the truth*. If it leads us to that truth, why tolerate the falsehood? 




 I disagree. The will of the people - as a whole - is best expressed during a Presidential election because everyone gets to vote for the candidates. There are 435 House races and 33/34 Senate races during each midterm election; it is hard to determine whether voters in those races were voting for or against any person other than those in each race (such as the President).

The recent election was certainly a Republican win. But it did not represent the will of the people as far as the President's policies are concerned nearly as well as the 2012 election did. 




  Freedom of Speech, as an idea, ... almost certainly covers any kind of institutional or mob-based attacks against speech

Source? At least in the United States, it refers almost exclusively to government attacks against speech.

Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech? Wouldn't that then be a violation of my First Amendment rights if the government stifles my speech to protect the speech of another? 




  Freedom of speech is a concept which can be extended to anyone trying to suppress speech.

Is it though? At least in America, it almost exclusively refers to the First Amendment version, i.e., no *government* interference.

I'm not really aware of any generally accepted concept of free speech that holds everyone should be allowed to say anything without repercussions from private individuals.

(Same edit from another post in this thread) Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech?

 Adding my anecdotal experience: smoked on and off for 15 years and have been smoke free for 3 thanks to e-cigs (don't smoke those either). 




 The veto power doesn't make him a king. But it does represent something of a People's Veto in the sense that the President is the only federal elected official who is accountable to every U.S. citizen.

Congress can't really claim to represent the will of the country like the President can. 




 The mortgage modification process is a joke in its entirety. The shenanigans aren't limited to Ocwen. 




 Didn't he basically ignore the multiplier notice though? I don't think Uber fleeced him, he just didn't pay attention. 




 Fairly certain I've ridden a dirt bike there. Weird/awesome place. 




 The President is also the only one in the federal government essentially elected by the entire country. 




 67? No way. 




 That's like saying if you are pro-Second Amendment, you are pro-forcing-people-to-become-gun-makers. In reality, there will likely *never* be a shortage of doctors or gun makers to that extent as long as a functioning society exists (because of market forces).

Edit: Another and perhaps better example would be attorneys. We guarantee due process of law, so if there is ever a shortage of attorneys, I guess we'd have to force people to go to law school. 




 OP is gay. Probably not friendzoned. 




 *LITraly 




 For the way I use Keep for work, this will actually change so much. No longer will reminders be an everyone or no one thing. 




 I feel like I'm from the future. 




 Story? 




 Nice try, NSA. 




 I said both are acceptable, which the article does imply ("some writers"). Either way, if enough people use it (e.g., ain't), it's correct. 




 ? They ruled it constitutional *as a tax*. 




 Both are [acceptable](http://www.grammarbook.com/numbers/numbers.asp) (Rule 11). 




 This problem is a lot like losing your contacts because you lost your phone: easily and completely avoidable. 




 I understand the sentiment but please don't lose patience with *supporters* of marriage equality. They only have to keep beating this dead horse because a good many people still continue to fight the advancement of civil rights. 




 Unisys 









 And with (1) you get to blame government red tape/growth. 




 the only reason Augusta even matters.

Hold up now. Ft. Gordon (pre-NSA/Cyber Command), SRS, Plant Vogtle, and the Augusta National might disagree. And James Brown. 




 I get all excited when I receive an actual letter from someone I personally know. These days they're more often than not "Thank You" cards but I still like 'em. 




 No, that doesn't help at all.

The comment you replied to has been deleted. What were you referring to here:

I am defending the Constitution of the United States of America and the fact that it sets forth requirements for voters.
Im sorry you dont like the Constitution.

 




 Ran across this last night and thought it was kinda interesting. 









 Where is this in the Constitution? 




 The U.S. Army is basing its Cyber Command in Augusta. Cool tech shit is happening. Ex., Unisys just announced a 700-person IT call center.

 [Brett Lee Clark](http://www.brettleeclark.com) does an excellent job. Not sure about cost though. 




 Until most businesses publish a contact email address *and* monitor it daily, the fax will have a place. 




 So is it finally happening? Are batteries improving? 




 Students or student teachers? 




 I apparently like Kentucky. 




 Why have the camera app on the home row on a Moto X? 




 I like this idea. 




 How many light years away is this though? We are looking into the past. 




 SCOTUS here we come... how could they deny cert now? 




 Is this the first circuit split? 




 The county clerks likely took an oath to uphold the U.S. and state constitutions so if any particular clerk wanted to issue licenses, they probably could. 




 The only real salient point is jurisdiction. A federal district judge in one state doesn't have jurisdiction over any other state.

Federal appellate judges have jurisdiction over multiple states, and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all states. 




 Why not just move to another country where taxes don't exist? Somalia might be a good choice.

Or do you enjoy that violence funded peace and security provided by the U.S. military via tax dollars too much? 




 A sizeable percentage of Americans actually probably would, though. 




 But the savings will accrue to the private landlord by way of a tax exemption. It's a direct diversion of taxpayer money to a private company.

If you're for privatization, fine. But private, nonprofit companies should pay taxes. 




 Be prepared. I've been practicing for 7 years and still get nervous (and older attorneys all tell me the same thing). Use your nerves as a weapon against being unprepared. You can stutter and fumble as long as you are prepared.

Other than that - practice. It simply comes with doing it over and over again. 




 If there's one vote that shows that voters had no idea what they were doing (with regard to this particular vote), it's:

**Georgia Referendum 1 - College Tax Exempt: 73% yes; 27% no**

What ideology supports extending state tax breaks to private companies? Certainly not the conservative one. 




 I think these are rare throughout the entire country. The Wikipedia entry states the first North American diverging diamond opened in June 2009.

Neat. Can't wait to try it out. 




 Dressage... haven't heard that term since November 2012. 




 Yep.

Hold on, everyone. Augusta 2020 will look a lot different than Augusta 2010. 




 Same here. Loyal since the start, and try to persuade others to use it. Very fine example of crowd-sourcing. 




 Not just his. 




 A realization that hardens every attorney. 




 /u/Stricker2054 essentially said:

Hydraulic pressure is hard to beat if hydraulic pressure exists at a level to make it hard to beat.

Edit: You may be trying to figure out if it is subtle or not - in which case I just might be unobservant. 




 I think this is what is called a difference of opinion. 




 Maybe Book Exchange on Bobby Jones (if they're still open). 




 Wow, the sentence is a very subtle tautology. Great example of saying something without saying anything. 




 Beetlejuice! 




 This makes me very happy for some reason. 




 Yes, I think they are real people in Columbia County (a post lists their names but I'm not going to link to it).

It's creepy to me because of the heavily implied "order" to vote for Republicans if you live in Columbia County. Also that the county is some sort of monolithic voting block. 




 I know at least one other person who doesn't support the minimum wage being increased to $10.10 because then they would be making minimum wage, and I honestly just don't get the mentality.

Do you want people to barely make enough money to live just so you make more than someone? 




 Man ain't that the truth. 









 GA here. "Punch buggy, no punch backs" always and forever. 




 Government intervention (likely by way of higher taxes on businesses and high earners) seems inevitable with automation.

Society will crumble if a few hundred people own all the robots and don't have to pay anyone. 




 There's a quarry off Riverwatch near I-20. 




 Quarry? 




 Tell the bigots to put their principles over money and ditch the iPhone. Then watch how many don't. 




  Will update post in ten years.

I've calendared this. Better fucking deliver, OP. 




 I know you're joking but serious question: Did Hitler ever serve in any armed forces (and in a combat role)?

In other words, did Hitler fight for his country? 




 My reply is that I prefer shitting and fucking in privacy. There are plenty of things that we want to be kept private for completely valid reasons.
