 Sorry but I don't think it would work. Think of the group Pussy Riot out of Russia. I hear that on news outlets regularly and the anchors say it without hesitation. 









 Meh. Probably a 4.
Two days ago I was laid off a month shy of my 2 year anniversary with the company and Im pretty deeply in debt from medical bills.
BUT I have a wonderful husband with a solid job that can briefly support us while I find another job. 




 Lol that is pretty weird, but hey whatever works!! I'm up for giving it a try.
Trying on jeans and standing in front of the mirror are two things that I do from time to time and they work in a really unfortunate way. 
The night I posted this my husband was working late and I did miss him, so maybe there's some truth to that. I'll let him know it's his fault ASAP. 




 You're right, one little slip up is not going to make me lose all my progress. In the past I always overreated to things like this in the past and gave up. I'm working on that.  




 Thank you, that's great advice!! I actually did spend some time on the living room floor doing double sit ups and push ups to feel better about it. I also logged it like you said, and it turns out it didn't negatively impact my day nearly as bad as I feared. I guess I just overreated. Tomorrow is a new day! 




 That makes so much sense, thank you for the advice! I'm definitely the type of person to go down the road and get a treat at the gas station if I remove everything from the house. 




 I'm having the hardest time with cravings after eating well all day. I've been logging everything I eat and following my macros on MFP. Today at lunch I even got a free chocolate chip cookie the size of my hand, and I resisted eating it and ate only my planned meal.

Later in the afternoon I started to break down and went to find the cookie where I left it. Luckily my coworker threw it away, preventing me from eating it. But as soon as I got home from work, the hunt began. I found some peanut butter chocolate leftover from Christmas and even ate some chocolate sprinkles out of desperation. All the while reading articles online about how to overcome sugar and carb addictions. I didn't put the candy down, I finished every bite while reading about portion control and overcoming cravings.

I'm afraid of logging what I just did to find out how much I threw off my day. It would have been my best day this week, but I completely screwed it up. What can I do to control and overcome these intense cravings? 




 Sorry for the late reply I tried to figure out how to find players on the website and I couldn't. Also I'm still very new to reddit and I have no idea how to PM but feel free to inbox me!! 




 I joined Chris   Heidi Powell ' s diet bet that official begins today, Jan 5th. You bet $30 that you can lose 4% of your body weight in 30 days. All the winners split the pot. 
If anyone is participating I'd love to follow you on the website throughout the month! 




 This is actually exactly what I'm needing right now. No judgement, just support. Someone who knows how this feels. 




 Fonts. Fucking fonts  




 "The best way to get over someone old is to get under someone new!"
No. Just...no. Deal with your shit, learn something from it, and try again later. 




 The day my best friend told me he was moving out of our house, I wish I would have talked him out of it. He killed himself in his new apartment leas than a month later. Turned out he planned it pretty far in advance but I feel like I could have saved his life if I had tried harder to make him stay. 




 Louisiana accents are never right. 
True Blood is like nails on a fucking chalk board in terms of bad accents, and north Louisiana looks nothing like that.  




 Constantly pointing out how much he hated drama, couldn't stand liars, and absolutely hated cheaters. I was young and stupid, he was older and hot so I believed him. He turned out to be all of that and so much worse. Cheating, lying, drug abuse, etc. 
I've learned that if someone has to constantly point out how upstanding their character is, the exact opposite is most likely the truth. Good character speaks for itself and doesn't need constant verbal reinforcement.
