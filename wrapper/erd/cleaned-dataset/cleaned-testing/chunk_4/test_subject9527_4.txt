 I just finished watching Racing Stripes and I realized that Hollywood makes a lot of these movies. They must be super cheap to produce. Anyway, have at it. I know nothing about this except for the critically acclaimed Snow Buddies saga, Babe and its sequel and the Air Bud franchise. Shit, I might be missing some good ones that I've seen.  
















































































































































 why?

I'm super excited. After the really unsatisfying initial release, this is a huge treat. There were bootlegs floating around on the internet but it's nice to finally have a legit release.

Excellent movie, excellent gun play, reminded me of John Woo except tighter, more grit and far more paced for straight action. But how did Eva Longoria even manage to find this one? Is she gonna be a producer on the next Continental film?

 Why would anyone want this film dedicated to them?

why did they keep doing the same "I'm about to walk out of the room oh shit i made a noise" trick 12 times?

So this baby stayed in the cabinet all night and part of the day and NEVER made a sound? Does no one go to bathrooms in bus stations? I've been to bathrooms in bus stations and it's like a urine donation center where they pay 5 dollars for a half gallon of your pee. 

If Michael Myers house is curse why did someone sell it to a new family? Who are these people? Why do they keep a shit broke down car on the lawn? Do they want it to look like a halloween house? The dad said he doesn't like halloween.

Why is the mom so naive? Like her kid keeps running away from her. Can't she see that this kid is a lost cause? He probably wants to get offed. 

What does the annoying blonde kid everyone hated have to do with Michael Myers? He's not blood releated. They don't make mention of this shit other than saying that he gets nightmares. But the baby is related to Michael Myers. What the fuck is this mythology?

What did the legion of the tipped hat do to get Michael Myers to have a kid? Did someone jerk off Michael Myers? Is Michael Myers a horny guy? Because he doesn't give any signs of it. 

Why does the legion of the tipped hat seem in cahootz with Michael Myers, but at the end Mr. Myers kills them? What was the point of them anyways? They were fufilling some half assed made up prophecy that i'm still not sure what the goal was, but they don't make sense.

What's the green goo? This addition made no sense. Why is there green goo? There's one insert shot of a bunch of letters. Is this Green Goo concentrated letters? Did scientists discover the alphabet is real? Why has this not been shared with the world? People would love to see real life letters. Sesame Street would be so cool.

Why is Michael Myers so fucking overpowered? I get he's a cereal killer, but this guy has fucking transportation power, but he can only walk. This makes no sense. How did he get these powers? Isn't Michael Myers just some large ass idiot with a high pain tolerance and a killer streak? Why is this not enough? Why does he need to be Halloween Goku? 

Why is Paul Rudd in this movie? I don't get his presence. He puts these family idiots in more peril second only to the main lady who's just a danger to herself. What's so important about the teenage kid? He's annoying. Let him go.

Why is this called the curse of michael myers? Michael Myers is just a dumb killing idiot machine. The curse is by the cult of the tipped hat. What does this have to do with ancient letters? Those letters never appear again after they are mentioned. 

Why even bother making number 6 if you don't have a script? This shit made no sense. Why does the lady not just drive till she runs out of gas back to town? Why did she stop at the bus station?  


































 I tried everything to get him to watch anything other than the 8 or 9 Marvel movies. I tried breaking his arms, I tried showing him other movies where I edited the Marvel logo in to trick him into thinking that MArvel produces Orson Wells and Carol Reed movies, I even tried to take him to a hypnotherapist to get him to see that Marvel movies aren't the best thing ever made. It turns out my son is leaving with my DVD of Batttman Vs Superman. Should I be worried? He said he wants to fornicate passionatly with the DVD and that there's nothing wrong with a relationship between a DVD and himself. 

My son has also decided to sexually identify as a DVD player and I told him you can't do that because it's all about imax and blu ray 8k you'd be behind the times and I'd have to disown you can't you idenify as a blu ray player at the least or a pc and he said no because he likes consols better and I said I have to disown you son. I don't know what to do. Is Battman captain of the Marvel team? I just can't figure a way to get to my son fifi. 









 Why are there no subtitles for Eddie Redmayne. He speaks like he's trying not to get caught pissing off in church.

Does NO ONE live in Chicago? I get the whole "we got alien CGI artists who can fix this to hide our presence" but during that whole dogfight apparently only three people live in the city. 

Why bees? How did this not get established in the prolouge?

Why is Eddie Abraxis so careful to not kill other human beings sometimes but sends his goons to kill three guys just ramblin' around a Chicago bridge? This dudes track record seems inconsistent. 

Why did Queen Kunis know about the telescope, exact make and model of the one stolen from the house in the beginning, was being sold on ebay? Her mom didn't tell her this stuff, or at least it's not established. 

Why did Channing Tatum break character when Mila Kunis offered to dress his wound with a tampon? 

Why is Mila Kunis in this movie? Why does everyone look like they are from Farscape? Is this a Farscape movie?

Why does Mila Kunis' cousin keep saying "Only English?" Does he know he's in a movie? Are CGI subtitles expensive? 

Why is there a romantic comedy in the middle of a space opera? I feel like Tim Gunn would feel these clash and would be poking at this movie saying "MAKE IT WORK."

How did Channing Tatum Master Chief that ship shirtless, in space, and without a suit? Only Master Chief can travel in a slipspace rupture outside of a ship. 














 Best prequel to Insidious possible. Was great to learn Lin Shaye's origin as a evangelical fighting against the Knights in Satan's Service. The camera work was also pretty awesome. Lots of movement, not a static shot in the whole movie.  




 Why does this guy make 3 mustache jokes within the first six minutes of the movie? Is this his thing? Is the mustache Mortdecai?

 














 What are these levels for creatures? Why mention that they have levels if you're not going to mention them again?

Why did Ben Barnes love interest admit everything villainous she's doing to Barnes' face and the dude didn't go, "Wait wut you're spying on us?"

Why did Jeff Bridges sound like he had fallen and had not been able to get up for such a long time?

If Ben Barnes is a witch why doesn't he have cool powers like everyone else? Is he a big dud witch? 

Why did Antje Traute sound like she was phonetically reading her lines off a cue card? I know she can speak fluently.

Why was Ben Barnes dad such a push over and what happened to the pig catching Barnes was supposed to do? They're in a small fenced area, how hard is it to catch one?

Does that big Ogre man have like super fast legs because he moves slow as fuck but he manages to find these dudes where ever they are in no time?

What's the deal with Pendle mountain? Is it a mountain? It doesn't seem like anyone has trouble finding Mother Malkin's hideout. It doesn't even seem like it takes long to get there at all? Can Pendle Mountain really be a mountain or a hill?

Why is [Marco Beltrami's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDhvQzcSes) better than anything in Seventh Son?

Why does Dijon Honeysue seem so overpowered and smart for the first hour and a half, but then turns into a big dolt in the final fight? 

Why did Malkin think there was going to be a sequel?

EDIT: Since making this post I have some additional questions.

Why is this not a Marvel movie? 

Why does Mother Malkin need that gumball crackerjack toy neckless when she and her crew are already ridiculously over powered?

Jeff Bridges has one week to train Ben Barnes, but this dude Barnes seems like he's pretty much a boss with fighting shit? What's the point of training? 

Why did JEff Bridges keep a demonic knight in his house if he knew that that shit would be dangerous?

Why is this movie so geographically fucked? I mean it looks like this shit has vast expanses between shit, but they seem to get everywhere really quickly? Do these dudes got nike j's or some shit?

And on the journey, they got one week, but it seems like they go past one week? Why one week? Mother Malkin seems like did a fine job without one week to fuck up shit? Why is Jeff Bridges so bad at his job?

What is Mother Malkin's skill set? Why does she have some sort of power to do interior decorating? Where do you get that power with all that shit?
