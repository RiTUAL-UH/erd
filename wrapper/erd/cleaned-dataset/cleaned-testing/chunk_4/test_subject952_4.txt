 Not unless you are on the same xbox. That fits up to four players. 




 You can get a three month sub. 20 bucks. Besides, you need a lot of people for hunger games, and you can't play it w/ out a map to play on. So to play hunger games on Xbox, you have to be famous on YouTube or something anyway 




 You can only play with people on a different xbox than you if you have a membership. 

However, you can play in a world with someone if they are on the same xbox as you (split screen) 




 I'll be on in a few minutes. I have to use my kinect, since I can't find my regular headset, so I might sound weird. Gt: jade sueta 




 Hmm. I only have about 60'friends but I'll try the internet thing in the morning. Ps. How do you reset your internet? I'm an idiot.

Edit: I now only have 46 friends and I reset my internet connection, it still doesn't work.. 




 Amen 




 What do mean "max to about 50" (sorry, I know nothing about anything) 




 Not that it matters or anything, but I'm a girl:)

 Like storyline. It takes a while to play through. ( I think ) 




 I have seen two library's, and spider spawners in front of a stronghold, but never a spawner in a stronghold. 




 I'm on mobile, but if you go on YouTube and look up stampy's lovely world, click on one of the videos. He build a bunch of different things every episode and they are pretty awesome. 




 I might be free tomorrow I'll help ya then. 




 Let's plays are always fun. Especially with 2 people. Like stampylongnose and Iballisticsquid are my favorite mine craft you tubers. They are really funny, and kid friendly, too.  




 Going into sixth grade or seventh? (Middle school starts in seventh grade where I live), and I'm also going into middle school this year. 




 GT: Jade Sueta. You can add me I'm too lazy. 




 Aww I just had to get off. I'll be back on in a few days though! 




 Am I too late? :D 




 Whenever I try to play with someone, it tells me to log in. But then it loads for a while and says " you have lost your connection to EA nation." Even when I first enter the game and press start, the first thing that pops up at the bottom is "you have lost connection to EA nation," has anyone else had this problem? 




 That would be awesome? What's your gamertag? 




 Xbox. 




 Yes sorry I forgot to clarify!  




 Does anyone go on this subreddit anymore? I'm looking for people to skate with, since none of my friends have this game. GT: Jade Sueta.  




 Wow. I'm glad you never got an abortion. I wish you and your children the best. 




 Do you regret it? We're you ever considering abortion? 




 Yes.  




 If only there was a solution to being called mainstream....... 




 The list is the same as everyone I have asked. Ever. 




 Interesting. What's your favorite drink then? 




 If I were to go to England, and do my best accent, would you be able to tell I was from America?  




 favorite song? 




 Favorite color?
Coffee or Tea? 
Favorite food?
Would you rather cut off your leg or cut of your dominant arm. 




 Sorry, I had to go. Try to be on tomorrow. I'll have a mic then. 




 Oh haha I should have figured. "Shane" anigans. I'll try to get on for a while. 




 My GT is Jade Sueta. 




 Will you be on in 3 hours by any chance? 




 Photograph. Or maybe Don't. Or Runaway.  




 I think the option for more than 8 players is ridiculous. It would lag so bad, even with good internet connection.  




 Well, my step mom keeps calling him ed sheerian and she already said "no listening to Ed sheerian when your family is talking to you." But I have no idea who Ed Sheerian is so I'm just gonna listen to Ed Sheeran instead. 




 I'm not really obsessed with him as a person. All I really know about him is he is a twenty-three year old singer from England. 




 Yes, actually. When P!nk's Truth About Love came out, I would listen to it more than a normal person would. But still, it was not to the same extent that this album's obsession has caused. 




 My family is starting to get mad at me for not paying attention to them. I just love his new album so much I feel I HAVE to listen to it. 




 Actually, this really isn't the Stampy we know and love. We love the child friendly, upbeat, joyous Stampy that never curses. 




 If you don't like it don't watch it. Simple as that. 




 Princess Consuela Banana Hammock. 




 My cousins are 8, 4, and 6 I think. There about 7 other people in the theater so it was nice except a kid kept kicking the back of my seat( I don't even know why they were there the entire theater was empty almost) I think they liked it. The four year old kept shouting( IM TIRED! IS IT OVER YET??) which I kinda wanted to say myself. I only liked it because the robots cute. 




 The robot was really cute, but it felt like the movie was over in five minutes. It was going really slow, then a bunch of action for like 20 seconds, then it being slow again. I spent about 1 hour watching pieces of metal forming a spaceship in the air. 









 To be happy and do what you want with your life. Don't waste your life doing things for other people, because at the end of the day, it's only you. Yolo. Don't waste it. 




 Guns.  




 I don't have skype.  




 Oh, I do to!  I think I'm gonna go to bed,  batman! I'll talk to you tomorrow night I guess. 




 I don't really care to be a comedian, but my lifetime goal is to be an actress. I am so excited to enter 7th grade this year so I can join Drama!  




 Black ops 2 is my favorite call of duty game.
Minecraft is my favorite arcade game.
Halo reach is my favorite Halo game. 
I also recommend Skate 3 and Naughty Bear!  




 Probably my obsession with humor. Whenever I hear someone laugh I want to make them laugh more and find out the joke and everything about it. I love making people laugh, so here's a joke!  

Why was the baby strawberry sad?
His parents were in a jam!



Okay, that was a bad one, but I need some time!  




 Yes! I feel like I have to go play xbox and find a way to politely excuse myself from the people that created me. And that's great that nothing has happened from the energy drinks. Just be careful!  




 My underwear. Accidental wedgies are the worst. 




 I would kill to be in your spot right now. I love talking to people over the internet, but it is totally different in real life. Except for family and best friends, I would be down to live as  a bat! Have you ever gotten ill  because of the amount of energy drinks you drink? Or has it ever affected you? 




 Look up Nigahiga's YouTube video "Dear Ryan, the chicken or the egg". I think the chicken came first. 




 This is actually REALLY interesting incase you didn't know. I would love to know more, but the problem is I don't know what to ask!  Do you ever get lonely since you have little social contact? 




 I concur! That's about where I am :) and I'm assuming you turned out fine :D I'm obsessed with books, which I wouldn't really consider geeky 




 What kind of kid were you in middle school 




 What time do you normally go to sleep in the morning/ wake up at night? 




 Where are you most ticklish? 




 Coke or Pepsi? 




 Well can't you  reverse it by doing the same thing with your new schedule so it will flip again? Then you won't need sleeping pills or anything. Just a thought!  




 I wanted people to know I was a girl when I had my old xbox live account. I just kinda kept with it.
