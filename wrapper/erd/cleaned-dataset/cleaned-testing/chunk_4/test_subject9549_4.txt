 I've never heard of that before. Perhaps I'll look into it.  




 I have IBS-C, and I get really bad cramps and when I "go" it's just awful. I spent a lot of days in the hospital as a kid because I would get so backed up and impacted. I, too, have described the pain like giving birth. In fact, I often joke that child birth should be a breeze for me considering I've been dealing with this pain all my life. 

The fact that you have black stool is a bit concerning. It could be something as simple as something in your diet, but it could indicate something serious if there is blood in your stool. You could have an irritable bowel disorder such as Crohn's. 

You should definitely see a doctor, particularly a gastroenterologist. I know it can be embarrassing and scary - I used to have the same feelings. I would always lie to my primary doctor about my bowel troubles because I didn't want to deal with it. This led to a shitty (ha, pun not intended...) childhood - I didn't go to sleepovers, hang out with friends much, or really date anyone because of my problems. I kept myself sheltered. However, with some support, I finally buckled down and finally saw a specialist. Mentally, I feel so much better knowing I have a diagnoses - someone affirmed that I wasn't just making my stomach issues up. Physically, I feel better because I'm having less flares, and now I have more control over my life since I'm not always having bowel issues. 

So, yeah, definitely recommend going to a doctor. Hopefully /r/IBS will give you the support you need. 

I wish you well :) 




 ...and I put the coat on her! 




 That's what I thought... Highly frowned upon at least.  




 Wow, thank you very much. I am trying to be more proactive, and I refuse to give up this time. I have started a migraine log and I'm trying to be as thorough as possible. Thanks again for your input. I'll try searching for other (and hopefully better) doctors.  




 I went to a doctor about a month after my concussion, and she told me my headaches were from taking too much medicine and not from the accident. She refused to put me on anything. I was only taking Advil a couple times of week, if that . 




 He didn't offer any free samples, just told me to try my mom's first. It was so weird. My husband about lost it when he said pregnancy was a treatment lol. 

This guy is supposed to be a migraine specialist. People gave him good reviews on HealthGrade, but he just seemed a bit whacky to me.

I must admit that I was not very prepared for the appointment. I randomly decided to make this appointment one day, and when I called they said "oh, we had a cancellation so we can get you in tomorrow morning!" which means I had less than 24 hours to prepare. I'll definitely be more prepared next time. 

Thank you so much for your input.  




 This was the first time I've ever seen this neurologist. I haven't had much treatment in the past - I've only ever been prescribed two types of preventatives and the Relpax. 

And no, I've never thought about that option before... What exactly is a neuropsychologist?  




 I've lived in Kentucky my whole life, I don't know how to properly pronounce Louisville, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.  




 I have an INFJ personality type, which is supposedly less than 1% of the population.

Btw, I am extremely ashamed this is the first thing that came to my mind.  




 Fack - Eminem. I like Eminem, but this is quite possibly one of the most ridiculous songs to ever be recorded.

 I tried changing my password to GameofThrones but the error told me it contains too many dead characters.  




 Damn. Now I wish I would've sent him one of our Marauder's Map wedding invites. Needless to say I'm so jealous! Congratulations!!!! 




 The lyrics for "By the Way" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers are "con job, boot strap." The first time I heard the song it sounded like he said "Cunt job, boob cat."  




 It's never stated for sure who that's supposed to be. However, if you google search Professor Aurora Sinstra this picture shows up. Additionally, according to Harry Potter Wikipedia, Sinistra has dark skin. It seems a lot of people believe it's her.  




 Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth. 

Edit: also, Heath Ledger as the Joker.  




 Sarah Jessica Parker - Horse. Also see "equestrian."
