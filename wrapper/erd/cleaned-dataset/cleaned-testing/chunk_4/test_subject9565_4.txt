 walk to remember  




 INMO I left the movie saying the effects were phenomenal. There is more to a movie then special effects. Gravity sweeped a lot of awards but I think also why 12 years a slave won because of the story itself.  




 Creative title  




 American Hustle an overhyped film that did not reach the expectations from all the buzz it was getting. 




 crazy stupid love 




 Salmon Fishing in the Yemen 




 I loved it. The music was also great as well.  




 Thank you. After hearing positive feedback yesterday, I told my parents after my dad told me that the chemo isn't working. It was not easy, but now I feel a lot better getting it off my chest.   




 Thank you, I needed this. I'm planning to tell my parents soon. Cross my fingers and hope it goes well. 




 This all means a lot, thank you 




 Thank you! 




 So ever since November, I have not been the same. My dad cancer has spread even more and it made me in a darker place that I thought I would never be in. I get up every morning with nothing to really look forward too. The only thing that gets me excited is movies and TV shows which is really sad but honestly the truth. I used to love Skiing and I just went for a few days, but its not the same as it used to be. I told my social worker what I have been feeling down and thinking suicidal thoughs which come and go away, but now she is scared for me. Which makes it worse. She wants me to go book an appt with the doctor and she wants me to tell my parents. My parents know nothing, they think I'm a happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh, but when I get home and go into my room its a whole other thing. A part of me just thinks its my head talking and I may not actually be depressed but i have no idea. I just don't want to be judged you know.  




 So again another friend took me go to see Endless Love. I saw the trailer and I didn't really want to see it as well it didn't do so well on Rotten Tomatoes. The only movie I really want to go see is Veronica Mars, but any how it is not a bad movie. Obviously, it is no where as good as the Notebook or Walk To Remember. It was a cute, romantic movie and the scene where the main female character gets in a car accident scared the living crap out of me. Has anyone seen the 1981 one with Brooke Shields?  




 Great show!  




 crossing my fingers! 




 Be careful because he may just want a friends with benefits thing.  




 It's nice to see that more people are starting to recognize Elizabeth Olsen. 
If you like her, you should watch Liberal Arts and I saw the premiere of "In Secret'' at TIFF. She put on an impressive performance.  




 LOL yes 




 Of course, we all knew what was going to happen. But the movie could of been done better. It was so obvious what was going to happen in Titanic, but the movie was 100% times better than Pompeii.  









 Veronica Mars  




 So my friends made me see Pompeii in 3D. The film in my opinion was a huge miss and I will forget I even watched this movie because nothing stood out in the movie. It is so obvious what was going to happen. Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington star in this flop movie. The effects and the music were good, but the acting and the storyline was lacking. And I just realized that the poster for Pompeii that is on IMDb is actually from the last scene of the movie. So you don't even need to watch the movie you can just look at the poster and you know what will happen. Kiefer Sutherland accent was terrible and he should stick to what he knows which is playing Jack Bauer and shooting people with a gun. What did you think of the movie? 




 50/50 




 Agreed! 




 Ben Affleck/Jennifer Lopez for Gigi (KIDDING) 




 Okay, so I try to watch as many as I can because I find if I don't watch any at all the award shows are boring. Plus there are some really good movies out there. I have seen every movie that has won main awards and I have seen 80% of all best picture noms. So I look at the Golden Globes or Oscar nominee list and I just check off the ones I've seen. Blue Jasmine is a movie you do not want to miss. 




 Congrats!!! Being nominated for an Oscar is incredible  




 I always look at Rotten Tomatoes, because it shows combined with users and critics if the movie is good or not. It does affect the way you watch the film because if you go on a site that says the movie rating is low you will have low expectations of the movie and may not be motivated to watch it, but its the same with good ratings such as American Hustle. American Hustle got great ratings and I was so excited about it, but when I watched it I was bummed because I had such a high expectations of the film because of the cast, director and the great reviews. When I watched it, it did not reach up to its expectations. It's good to know if the movie is worth watching with the ratings, but don't take it too strongly all the time because sometimes a movie that is rotten is actually one of my favourite movies. So it all depends on the individual.  




 Kristen Bell in Frozen (don't judge), I had no idea that this girl got singing skills  




 I can see how he can be a villain, but also see as a hero. He is a hero in a way because he helps Iris out. But he is more of a villain, INMO. Yes he saves Foster's character, but I wouldn't call him a hero.  




 Channing Tatum- overrated, he's easy on the eyes, but other than that I think that's why he's only casted in movie roles.
Miles Teller- underrated- Spectacular Now, and apparently his performance in Whiplash stands out as well. 




 Hard to have one, when there is so many.
Bradley Cooper- Sliver Linings Playbook
JGL- 50/50
 




 I don't like Girls HBO show 




 So I just got into House of Lies. Honest truth, there is so much better TV material out there. This is not the best or the worst. It's the entertaining, it takes a while to get into the series. I would watch a few more to decide  if you want to continue on or not because it does get more interesting as eps goes on. Kristen Bell INMO kills it by far then the rest of the cast. There so many great lines in the show worth watching. I say give it one more try 




 Go house of lies  




 Brody from Homeland  




 Easy A, Pitch Perfect (saw four times in the movie theatre), 50/50, sliver linings playbook 




 This is a little different but Jessica Chastain went from a nobody to a somebody with the success of The Help, Zero Dark Thirty etc. 

Robert Downey Jr. 

Maybe Sandra Bullock   




 Did not like the Butler. 
Sandra Bullock performance in the Blind Slide was alright, I did not think it was Oscar worthy.
Emma Stone needs to stick to comedy
