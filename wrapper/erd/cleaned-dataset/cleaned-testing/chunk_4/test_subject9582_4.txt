 Yes, he just kept him around for his savagery. 




 A painting contractor was speaking with a woman about a job. In the first room, she said she would like a pale blue. The contractor wrote this down and went to the window, opened it, and yelled out "GREEN SIDE UP!" In the second room, she told the painter she would like it painted in a soft yellow. He wrote this on his pad, walked to the window, opened it, and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady was somewhat curious but she said nothing. In the third room, she said she would like it painted a warm rose color. The painter wrote this down, walked to the window, opened it and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady then asked him, "Why do you keep yelling 'green side up'?"
"I'm sorry," came the reply.
"But I have a crew of blondes laying sod across the street." 




 Not all of his supporters were branded with the mark either, Greyback for example. 




 Sentient.. you keep using this word, I do not think it means what you think it means.

They cannot talk, and sentient means you are aware that you are alive. (are dementors alive?) 

Picture a wasp nest for dementors. There is almost a pheromone of fear that is sent out that attracts them all that they would seek to feed on. 




 I used to have a white rat. Very cunning creatures they are. 




 The lion knows what I'm talking about. 




 Not all of us. 




 I will start with the Wizenagamot, (OotP, Fudge) when it's spelled Wizengamot. (wIzen-gamot) If I'm not mistaken. 




 I can think of a few, I want to hear yours. 




 Curious that question. 

Perhaps she drank enough to sate the circumstances until her death?

One needs an hour per dose, and maybe Barty Sr. procured enough to last a few days until she died?

That would be horrible drinking nothing but PP for days. 




 That's funny, not seen that before.

Happy cake day /u/jmg83. 




 Well, that would be up to the Wizengamot to decide, right? 




 Veritaserum is not allowed in wizard courts because it can be fooled if the recipient truly believes what they are saying. Same reason polygraphs are not admittable evidence in muggle court, they can be fooled. 









 I took the pottermore quiz three times. Two Ravenclaw, and one Slytherin. I'm comfy where I am. 




 Edit to your previous comment:

Yea, they sent Dawlish after Augusta, LOL. Big mistake there. 




 Augusta: Where's Neville?

Harry: He's fighting.

Augusta: Naturally, I must join him.

I also missed the battle of the astronomy tower in HBP. That could have been so exciting. 




 I KNOW! That was the first big battle we got to see, and damn if it wasn't glorious! Neville deserved so much more respect and screen time. 




 No, Neville probably made the most progress throughout book 5, and he was a badass at the BotM, I wish we could have gotten to see it all.

"Dubbledore!" 









 Maggie Smith- given, Richard Harris- RIP, and I'm going on a limb here and say Emma Thompson. I've always loved her as an actress, and she was the perfect Trelawney.

Evanna Lynch for honorable mention.

 Or the extra 15 it took you to reply? 




 Dag nabbit!
 




 Albus Dumbledore explains that it is unwise to make a horcrux from a living thing (Nagini) because all you have to do is destroy the container beyond repair, and it isn't hard to kill something alive.

Harry was not a *true* horcrux anyway, they require an enchantment/ritual to make and he did not do that in 1981. When Riddle used his blood in the graveyard, that kept Harry alive as long as Voldemort was because he used Lily's blood and her sacrifice, so it worked as sort of an anti-horcrux for Harry. 




 Especially in GoF. 




 Before the ministry fell, there was no taboo. I am under the impression that the taboo was instated after the ministry fell so the DEs could find members of the Order. When the trio were at Tottenham in the coffee shop, Hermione says Voldemort, and that's how Rowle and Dolohov found them. 

Ron found out about the taboo after he had left the other two in the Forest of Dean. 




 Indeed. 




 No, the DEs attacked the wedding because they had just killed Scrimgeour, and all the protective enchantments the ministry had put on the Burrow were no more. 




 the young bull says, "I'm going to run down this hill and fuck one of those cows in the valley."

The old bull says, "I'm going to walk down and fuck them all." 




 Thank you, I'm watching the episode now.
 









 I'll probably get down voted to Kronos for this, but as all of the best have been cited, I'll offer this bit: 

"What I am about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it is a gut feeling. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do." 




  "Of my friend, I can only say this: Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most ...human."

I posted this when Nimoy died. 




 His arms open, his sails unfurled. 




 I was born in the Chinese year of the dragon, the only fictional animal in the Eastern zodiac. I have a dragon tattooed on my forearm.

I was also born under Libra in the Western zodiac, the only non living representation.

TL;DR: I am a strange one. 




 Nothing. It's a spell to unlock doors. 




 That depiction of my wand is damn near spot on. Thank you /u/obversa 




 Cheers Spooky. 




 First use of a Colin Hay song also, if I'm not mistaken. 




 A woman came home just in time to find her husband in bed with another woman. With superhuman strength borne of fury, she dragged her husband down the stairs to the garage and put his penis in a vise. She then secured it tightly and removed the handle. Next she picked up a hacksaw. The husband terrified, screamed, "Stop! Stop! You're not going to......to....cut it off are you?!" The wife, with a gleam of revenge in her eye, said, "Nope. You are. I'm going to set the garage on fire." 




 I'm American mate, I doubt I could add to this discussion. I commented so I could see the future posts. 




 Books first.. Always. 




 Has been for almost seven years, dude. 




 [Me too](http://i.imgur.com/3n468q7.jpg) 




 I like what that guy said. 




 Because Harry is not a smart man. 




 There are worse things than death, Tom. 




 Paging /u/DrFreud 




 A very thirsty man goes into a bar.
As he waits to get the bartender's attention, a regular sitting next to him calls out, "I'll have another waterloo."
The bartender gives the regular a tall ice cold drink and asks the newcomer what he would like. The thirsty man points to the man next to him and says, "I guess I'll have what he's having, a waterloo."
So the bartender brings the newcomer a tall ice cold drink. The man takes a long deep drink and calls out, "HEY! This isn't any good. It tastes just like water!"
The regular bar patron sitting next to him says, "It is water. That's all I drink," He turns to the bartender and says, "Right Lou?" 




 Why isn't lake Titicaca filled with boobs and poop? 




 The ring was cursed and caused Albus' death. After he broke the stone, he knew that he wasn't worthy. It's all explained in the *King's Cross* chapter. 




 IDK, but I do know that Harry was against killing. 




 Harry knew that he was the master of the elder wand, and that he would win the battle. 




  Voldemort has no remorse and is incapable of emotions like caring and love

Correct, how many death eaters did he whack at Malfoy Manor after Harry and Co. escaped? 




 I would agree that Severus was a better wizard than the marauders.

You have to realize that it wasn't just The four Gryffindor boys picking on Snape all the time, Snape took his shots at them whenever he could. Remember the bit in OotP when Harry was talking to Lupin in the fire at 12 GP? 




 Pardon my assumption. 




 Oh wow. I would look like an ass if their were hidden points for them somewhere, eh?

One point... 









 No, she was a strong snake he found in Albania. Still it is extremely unwise to make a horcrux from a living, sentient, being. 




 Only because he made her a horcrux. 




 I answered your question. 




 As of 00:00 EDT we Claws were up four points. Yea, we won. 




 Tom Riddle cared for no one. All he wanted around him were people he could use.

But to answer your question, I would say Bellatrix. He actually became angry when Molly killed her. 




 Perhaps Harry is giving him praise that Albus feels is undeserved? Is that your point? 

I had never thought of it like that, but I can see it now. Take my upvote. 









 Yea, Colin wasn't of age either to stay for the BoH. 




 I'm with you. Not to mention the shuffling of the timeline. Harry got the Firebolt for Christmas, and it had to be stripped down. He didn't get it at the end of the year. 




 Dennis was also only a fifth year, yet he snuck back in to the Battle of Hogwarts.

Honestly, I think Dennis Creevy is a Gryffindor that I would love to learn more about. That kid had nuts of solid steel.

Edit: I don't remember, and I'm not about to look it up. I could be wrong. 




 I had not put that together. I wish Columbus could have directed all of them. 




 No. 




 Yes, ABC Fam includes all of the deleted scenes. We even got to see Petunia telling Harry about losing a sister before she left 4 PD. 




 Dumbledore's greatest power. Love. When Lily Evans cast herself between Harry and Voldemort that night, it protected Harry. When Riddle tried to kill Harry, the spell rebounded and destroyed his body leaving him nothing more than a spirit. The remaining bit of his soul as a result of killing Lily latched on to the only living thing it could find which was Harry. Horcruxes require intent...

The damn cat was probably hiding in the basement.

 Ride the train both ways because it's a different experience both times. 

If you would like some real input, there is a WWOHP Wednesdays here where we share pics and discuss what to do there.
 




 that the student's wandlight tribute to Dumbledore removed the dark mark.
 




 Yea, Bagman brought them to the pitch, and asked them if they knew what it was going to be. Krum mumbled, "maze." 




 No he's not. He's a puppet of the Koch brothers. 




 That was when I was a teen to my twenties. Then I discovered the sweet varieties of kush. 




 I used to smoke from the time I woke to the time I went to sleep. Now I just smoke one bowl a day. 




  Garlic on nails

That would make them more delicious!

 Bananas. 




 The full Scrubs theme song. 




 A four inch piece of compost after a failed BMX attempt. It slid straight into my calf muscle, and I had to go to the hospital to remove it, and take an IV of antibiotics. 




 Looks like an uncut member. 




 I like to hike in especially high places, and I am always terrified of falling. I get vertigo extremely easy, and I even have dreams about falling off cliffs. 

Not the falling really, just the sudden stop at the end. 




 Do you think it was ever possible to just touch your wand in the right place and record within ten feet/meters? I'm thinking about the charms on the WWW Umbridge charm. It was in the book something they made that had her voice. 




 Harry, Snape and Riddle all found a home they never had at Hogwarts. I think they were described in DH as 'the three lost boys.' 




 You are correct.
 




 Gooch/Kate Micucci was a comedian long before she was ever on Scrubs, and the original lyric is 'fuck you'. You're welcome to google it. 




 Hermione has butterfly bandages on her face which makes zero sense.

You're telling me Poppy couldn't heal a simple cut?

As much as I hate GoF film, Alfonso was the worst director in my opinion. 

(I used his given name instead of his surname because I don't know how to do the accent mark over Cuaron.) 




 Yep. The beginning of OotP is 1995 I think. 




 He said I was exceptional! 




 Not to mention that The Book of Love was the absolute best song to end the series with, and then Bill is the trashman at the end. 









 Some years back I got one of those 20Q games designed as a snitch, that is age appropriate also. 




 That's just Hermione. 




 Thanks KoKo. Good morning to you.
 




 I would assume so. It's the magic of the Veela that attracts people to them. Remember the QWC when the Veela were on the pitch, and everyone was strangely attracted to them? I'm sure they could attract even the straightest of women, supposing that it was a female Veela. Or the same for male Veela really. It's just their charm. 




 Yes. Those two lines between them were also improvised, and like you said, Harris was smiling at them being super creative together.

Edit: *Let's hope Mister Potter will always be around to save the day.* 




 Kingsley was a main factor in keeping Sirius free by leaking false trails that Sirius was abroad. Long story short, I doubt Shacklebolt ever considered Sirius guilty after 1994. 




 Isaacs had read the first two books and improvised that line. I don't think it was in the script. Columbus had told him to say a gibberish spell, and that's what he came up with. Sorry I can't find a source. 




 Aside from everything else, it's just a very well written epic. I forsee HP being required reading in schools in the near future. 




 Sure as the stars above, I'd really like to fuck you. 




 Then his legs are asleep. 




 I always love Ted and Gooch's duet. 




 I woke my wife up laughing.

 I shower every second day, and wash my (long) hair every fourth.

How often do you brush it? 




 Everybody back on the bus!! 




 I would have a blue smoke dispensary called Sorcerer's Smoke.

We would have many locations throughout the wizarding world, some in muggle villages disguised as normal smoke shops.

Sorcerer's Smoke would cater to those that need a bit of relaxation in their lives, and has just recently come on to the open market.

Our claim to fame would be the many visits by the Dumbledore brothers, and a few more notable aurors in the early underground days. Sorcerer's Smoke used to be a secret on the black market before we became a bit more main stream.

When you walk into our homey shop, you will have your choice of almost fifty blue varieties to help any witch or wizard relax no matter what mood they may be in.

The walls are lined with plush couches and chairs to sink into while you enjoy your wares, so come on down to Sorcerer's Smoke, and relax after a long day!

 I see it as Lupin had just come off a transformation and as he wasn't quite endowed with gold, it was the cheapest way to get there. I also see Lupin riding the HE as a bit of a machina so She could introduce dementors and patronuses. 




 Oh yea, it's ridiculous. I pause it so I can fast forward through the commercials.
