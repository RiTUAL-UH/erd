 I think it is fairly absurd that the NIH estimate for number of postdocs working in the US has an error of 15,500 people.  Are you fucking serious? 




 Five will tie; Six is needed to break the record (currently has 503, record is 508).  I would say the SF game has to be the odds on favorite for when the record goes down. 




 I know the season has only been going four weeks and five days, but to the Seahawks O-line, it seems like nine weeks and five days. The first day seemed like a week and the second day seemed like five days and the third day seemed like a week again and the fourth day seemed like eight days and the fifth day you went on a bye week and that seemed just like a day and then you came back and later on the sixth day, in then evening, when we saw each other, that started seeming like two days, so in the evening it seemed like two days spilling over into the next day and that started seeming like four days, so at the end of the sixth day on into the seventh day, it seemed like a total of five days. And the sixth day seemed like a week and a half. I have it written down, but I can show it to you tomorrow if you want to see it.  




 Speaking of the Raiders, I will need you to beat them.  Let me explain.

At the moment, the Raiders have won 4 more games, all-time, than the Broncos (including playoffs).  In five weeks, these teams play each other.  If my math checks out, should the Raiders lose out, and the Broncos win out (until that game), my glorious Broncos will be able to overtake the Raiders for most all-time victories in the AFC West *by beating them*!

I want this very badly. 




 Whoo!  I love color-on-color uniforms!  The Broncos' Blueberries, Ravens' All-Blacks, even the stupid Chiefs All-Reds from MNF!  

I want orange pants for my boys, but will settle living vicariously through other teams until I get them. 




 I think that is a legitimate opinion.  Even an NFC championship outside of the Clink has to make em nervous.

( I feel similarly with Peyton and the Broncs; would rather not play in Cincy, Foxboro. San D would be okay.) 




 Does it say what kind?  We lost Clady to a Lisfranc last year. 




 And also we're not sissies.  




 Yup.  Trent Dilfer revealed [the secret] (http://lightlybuzzed.com/2014/10/06/vine-trent-dilfer-explains-secret-winning-nfl/) yesterday.   




 Particularly when he tries to jump the route and guesses wrong; no DB in the league can recover from something like that. 




 I think it was exactly like this (or very close to it).  Poor communication or missed communication resulted in Thomas and Clady both going in for the block. 




 Yeah, no worries.  For some reason they are very insistant on keeping separate runnings for regular season wins and all-time wins - I guess so you can compare an equal number of games from all teams (hence, why the stats you gave had both teams playing the same number of games).  I have been bitten by that bug before, so I knew to look for it.

Go Broncos and No Go Raiders!  I *really* want to have the pleasure of surpassing them in wins **in person**! 




 This is regular season wins, right?  I think the Raiders still have us in All-Time wins.

Yep:

459-397-11 (Raiders) vs 455-396-10 (Broncos). [Source] (http://www.profootballhof.com/UserFiles/file/W-L-Start-2014.pdf) (I added 3 to Broncos total and 0 to the Raiders total because they suck)

Say what you want about the Raiders ("Fuck the Raiders" is a popular choice), but even as bad as they have been these last 10+ years, they have still won more games that we have.

It looks like we are four games behind the tie, and five games behind taking the lead outright.  Hmm, we play the Raiders in 5 weeks . . .

So, if the Broncos win out and the Raiders lose out, then we could pass them in all-time wins by beating them!

I never knew I wanted this so badly until now!

 




 Very very stupid play from Julius here.  It is right at the border of being legal / illegal (what with the lure part of the rule), but I think it is clear that there was no reason for JT to throw this block - A) Clady is fully capable, B) The play develops way too fast for this to be needed, and C) He either missed his target (more likely) or deliberately tried for the knee (less likely,  I think).

I would doubt any malicious intent, but this was very poor judgment and execution.  It really sucks that the defender was injured here, on what should have been an innocuous play at those positions. 




 I know, right?  Nice manufactured narrative, mediaheads. 




 Ugh, I hate that shit.

And the records!  Just assuming Manning would hit 500, and Brady 50000.  You know people's careers can just end, right?  Holy shit shut up until things actually happen. 




 We have to make different categories for scripted and reality shows, because, "The Swan" actually happened.  




 There are a good number of Pats fans who know their NFL history, know the rulebook, and realize the difference between a lateral (which is intended) and a fumble (which is not) - and they are handling that play well, explaining everything nicely.  Good on ya.

And then there are a lot of Pats fans ignorant of NFL history, who are content to bitch and moan instead of educating themselves.  Read a book.

 




 Take care of this first drive and it is a 10 point game.  That has to be the plan. 




 You're probably about 50% to score from 1 yard out.

50%  7 points = 3.5 expected Value

You're almost100% to get the FG (sorry, Romo).

100%  3 = 3.

3.5  3.  Math says go for it. 




 They did the bye with us.  They have 12 straight weeks of games! 




 That's the spirit, horse-bro!

(I know they are also horses, I guess) 




 Well, Season 4 of *The Wire* is possibly the greatest season of television ever.

There was bound to be a little let-down.  I dig ya, though, season 5 has some weirdness. 




 He is also 14/16 on touchbacks. 




 My wife just flipped her shit hearing that.  She said someone would never say that a mother was babysitting her own kid.  




 Truf. 




 AhahahahahahahahahahhahahaHhah!   Matt Flynn looks like Peter Saarsgaard (probably one too many As)!!! 




 But if he kicks another, it is 42-13 (instead of 42-7, maybe) - so the HC can argue they kept it within 4 score on TNF against hated rival GB.

It's what scared shitty coaches do everywhere! 




 Hahahahahahaha. 




 Left out 3 TD,  0 INT.   




 Vikings bad.  Packers better.  Ponder worst. 




 She knew what this was . . . 




 Only out by 5 yards. 




 Booooooo.

I am 30 points in the hole, when Lacy was a non - entity 3/4 weeks.  Whatever.

Still gonna win. 




 I anticipate that some of the games will be good.  There's Pats/Jets next week and Chargers/Broncos week 8.  Probably a few more reasonable ones too.

But, in reality, Thursday games are a travesty.  Nix them altogether and give us two timeslots of December Saturday games after CFB goes into bowl hibernation. 




 Gif request: sad vikings fan whose ear flappy hat wasn't even purple. 




 I *really* like the matte.  I want matte. 




 DM,SF 




 This is still better. 




 Dumpster fires are at least warm. 




 Yeah, and Goodell never saw that tape, neither. 




 4 minutes left in the 2nd quarter and they are already looking for other shit to talk about. 




 Fuck you and your Matt Cooke - employing Wild!

J/K.  Excited about opening up against your boys. 




 So what are the reasonable hopes for good TNF games?  Chargers @ Broncos is week 8 or something.  




 How do you feel now, with this statement committed to Internet permanence - yet with 7 more points?  




 McKinnon Out Burger!  McKinnon Out Burger! 




 I am sure he will just keep sexual assaulting people and get on the commissioner's exempt list. 




 Powered through,  though, eh? 




 Meh, Bad, Meh, God, Undetermined.  




 Here's a fun little hobby of mine:  every time someone says, "Suck" in what is assumed to be a socially-acceptable situation, I mentally add in, "Dick" or "Cock".

You know, 'cuz that's what it really means.  As a result, I was in hysterics early on in this video.

"Following up on that, why do you say they suck [dick]?"
 




 This was *exactly* was Tebow was like for a population of our fans. 




 Line has crept up to Broncos (-8).  You can be scared if you want, but that is a really strong line.

(FWIW, I think that line is WAY too high.  But, Vegas, etc.) 




 Hating OCs is all the rage these days.  Patriots, you guys, Steelers, hell even some over in /r/denverbroncos are pissed at Gase for his two-tight end heavy game plan (which went to shit when Virgil Green got concussed), and continuing to run the ball.   




 There were a couple of Wild Cat-style plays with Tebow under McD, but you're correct that Tebow didn't start until Stidesville's interim gig. 




 I don't agree that players (or even Belichick) acting like they are above the press is the issue - the issue that Belichick (and other coaches) have always had is with lazy, unoriginal, or goading questions.  These are the real problem - not the press as an institution, but the shitty reporters who are either bad, boring, or intentionally trying to stir up controversy.

I mean, if you just coached or played in a loss, and the reporter asks something like, "Tell me about the inability of your team to pass protect tonight" - *what the fuck are you supposed to say*?  That is such a shitty, lazy question, and it should be treated with as much respect and effort that the interviewer gave to the interviewee. 

That is why I respect Belichick when he goes on one of these broken records - give him (and his players) enough respect to actually ask an insightful question, or be prepared for your bullshit answer. 




 AWW, THAT'S KINDA NICE.  AND MEAN.   




 YES!  I NOTICED THIS AND SPECIFICALLY TOLD MY WIFE THAT FOX JUST FUCKED THE STEELERS!!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU AND I CAN AGREE ON, BUT I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY WE BOTH HATE THE STEELERS. 




 "Toxic love", but yeah, you're really close. 




 No contest.

Avatar was straight-up Evil Military Man destroys native home at behest of soulless corporate white collar nobody.  Tired, cliched, stupid, insulting.  The "evil" here is comical, unimaginative, and can teach us nothing.

Ferngully was blue collar normal people just doing their jobs when they are taken for a ride by a force greater than themselves (and kinda mystical).  This is how evil is done in the real world - common folk unwittingly ascribing to evil ideas far greater than they understand.

Ferngully  Avatar.

And that's without even talking about the musical numbers. 




 . . . as a singing lizard. 




 So the relevant maths here is: 2012+18 = 2030. 




 This is exactly what happened with Shanahan in Denver, except the coach only bailed the GM out enough to be AFC West division title competitive. 




 Generally, as an enveloped virus, you're talking 10s of minutes outside of the body. 




 Largely, the thought is that an organized, first world medical system has the appropriate infrastructure and knowledge to prevent any outbreaks of epidemic proportion.   Additionally, the general populace in the US is more trusting of medical personnel and not as prone to superstition as the populace in Western Africa.

That being said, there hasn't really been an Ebola virus epidemic in a place with a very high population density,  so it is not really known if unique challenges will present themselves in that sense.

Regardless, much work is currently underway, and some of it is very promising.  Multiple strategies for treatment and prevention are looking to be very effective,  so I think that it is very likely that even in the case of an Ebola outbreak in the US, it will not be catastrophic.  




 Rise to vote, sir! 




 Tonight my wife asked if the Redskins did the tomahawk chant ( like the Seminole and Braves) and my answer was: "Nah, they're racist enough already". 




 I think 10-6 runs away with the East, and 9-7 could be good enough.  If the Pats are that team, they'd be a tough out in the WC in NE in January. 




 Ditto. 




 Edit:  obv, Ravens fans remember.

Also me, because I am a sad man. 




 Exactly; nobody remembers that the Ravens went 1-3 and fired their O.C. The December before Flacco evolved into Elite Joe and cruised to a Superbowl MVP.   




 CTE may actually destroy the NFL.  It looks bad, bad, bad. 




 What's your scotch? 




 That is the worst time management I have seen outside of a 49ers game.

Hon.  Men.  Cowboys.  




  Archer joke dude.  Relax. 




 Nonsense; just tilt your head back. 




 Read a book. 




 You, sir,  are technically correct - the best kind of correct!  




 Bold 4u.  Love it. 




 Yeah, it is almost fun at this point, seeing who gets roped in and who just chuckles to themselves. 




 I want all oranges. 




 Made Aviations for wife and I, what did I miss?

Oh . . .  




 So eyesores.  Much orange.  Wow. 




 I wish we had all All-Orange Unis. 




 Yeah, that is outstanding. 




 Ha!  At the -40 mark atm.  It's a joke, people. Multiple congratulatory posts and I get lambasted for my joke.  W/e. 




 That's because you've only watched ~20 games!

J/K.  Good game Seahawks. 




 And your* a moron.

* sic. 




 I love manufactured stats.  Stfu, idiots. 




 These concepts are not compatible. 




 I like to call him Philipe Rios. 




 So cool.  This is the game we deserved. 




 I already came. 




 Book says 2.  Wtf Fox? 




 Nobody ever likes the whistling guy.  There were these two assholes *right* by the mic on the boards of an Avalanche game last year just baking all the time and talking.  Fuck them. 




 Yeah, I might have tried for the reverse situation.  




 Good conclusion drawn from a large sample size, all of which were from both teams at full strength on neutral fields.  You're doing God's work, sir. 




 What kind of discussion even happens there in that ref huddle?  How do you pick up an offsides call?  There's two refs who are on the line - maybe one of them says everything wad fine?  Wtf wad he looking at, and why is his opinion worth more than the one who threw the flag.  Absolute bullshit. 




 Better yet:  give it Brandon Perna. 




 Your brain has swapped some concepts on you. 




 Ditto NBC and FOX 




 What a responsible opinion.  You are cool. 




 That infuriates me. 




 Anus.  Anus. 




 So I live in Madison now.  I am thinking about traveling for the opener.  Should I? 




 Do you take cash?
