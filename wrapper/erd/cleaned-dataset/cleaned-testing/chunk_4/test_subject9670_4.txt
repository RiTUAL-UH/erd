 It isn't automatic... I just type it out 




 4th paragraph

 The improvement in condenser heat transfer, which is just one step in the power-production cycle, could lead to an overall improvement in power plant efficiency of 2 to 3 percent based on figures from the Electric Power Research Institute, Preston says  enough to make a significant dent in global carbon emissions, since such plants represent the vast majority of the worlds electricity generation.  




  The engagements happen quickly, and unless you're staring at a screen 247 you'll never see them, Blount says. So we've built sound in for whenever we fire the laser. We plan on taking advantage of lots of Star Trek and Star Wars sound bites.

 x-post: /r/drought 




 it was meant as a joke 




 I kept meaning to come back and add to that... ...but i figured i'd just wait until you replied.

*since* you're a part of the the production team... I'm going to rant about this... it's as much a rant as a suggest... / a suggest as a rant

batteries.

i can understand in cell phones, certain laptop designs, etc ... ...but, extended battery packs.   

if this thing can lift 200lbs ... or even 20lbs for 2 hours...

My guess is you're using a combustion engine or fuel cell? I mean, you'd almost *have* to be.   ...which is awesome!

but, even the battery powered drones.  why not make extendable battery packs that use standard 'I bought 'em at walmart' battery pack extenders

My favorite cell phone battery extender deal is [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Energi-To-Go-Battery-Operated-Instant/dp/B000JD09P4) ... and it came out nearly a decade ago.

Why they're awesome: it's simply a case.  sure this one comes with 2 AA's (non-rechargeable) ... but I keep a 4-battery quick-charger in my car all the time (with 4 batteries in it)... and one of these.  if for whatever reason I'm *not* using my car charger, I can use this thing (hiking, fishing, camping, ... festivals, airplanes, that sort of thing.  'whatever' keeps me from being able to plug my phone in while still having me want to use it ... bike riding.)  

but, what's awesome about it is... well, how its applicable to what i'm about to say.....which, in itself, probably *isn't* applicable to your design relative to the fact that it's probably not even battery powered to begin with (which is awesome btw! ... but even with it, I can come back to it).

what's awesome about it is I can throw in more batteries.  standard, rechargeable 2800mAh AA's (or higher, just that all of mine are Energizer's 2800mAh so I'm using that as the example).    *each* cell with enough to nearly charge my 3'000mAh phone entirely up. ... and there are two of them.   if they die? I can simply swap them out with more... and have the next pair recharged in 15 minutes with the quick charger if, for whatever reason, I *don't* have a car or house charger with me.

If all my rechargeables are dead (it's happened... European tour trips and Octoberfest all day drinking binges and the such happen.. what can I say :)  ... I can just *buy* two AA's at *any* store and.. ...i'm back up   running again.

ok, the second variable with this.. that I feel is applicable.   pass-through-powering... *while* charging.

the ability to plug my phone into it, *power* the phone off of them, as *well* charge the battery at the same time.

now, apply this to the drone.

*if* the drone's battery powered (and even if it isn't, and i'll get back to this in a sec) .... and *esp* if the drone can lift... 2lbs.. let alone 200....

then it can lift extra batteries.  Why *not* make the drone just as capable?   create 'packs'.  *like* this.  I mean, I buy a remote control car, hell, even a free flashlight from Harbor Freight.. and it has a cheap piece of plastic with some metal that lets me throw 3 batteries into it that act like one... or parallel them if more voltage is needed... ..slide it in   out... and... move on with life.  a drone with similar capability would be awesome!  

let me screw one of these into the bottom where the camera screw hole is... *then* screw the camera into the bottom of *it* ... or something along those lines ... ...but, in such that I can throw on more power... quickly... and still get the other features.  ...and with standard batteries!  make the 'port' where the cable or whatever plugs into ... ...hell, *make* battery packs of certain shapes, sizes, configurations, etc ... ....*sell* them on the site... ..but also allow for 'generics' to be used.

it's the universality of it. 

and, when dealing with something that can lift 200lbs??? hell, you could throw *ten* of [these 9lb 60Ah-equivalent bad daddies on it](http://www.jegs.com/i/Lithium+Pros/403/L3420R/10002/-1?CAWELAID=1710807060 CAGPSPN=pla catargetid=230006180000848939 cadevice=c gclid=CjwKEAjwnKCrBRCm1YuPrtWW0QMSJAC-5UYkGR873uqGn2z1rT-Rpk_B9JXm7xxoMNBVRjBbbYwU8hoC1WTw_wcB) and *still* have 100lbs to spare...

....if a passthrough charge/power port is available ... like every. single. cellphone   laptop have had since ... 1990.

alright, jump back... 

lets assume all of this is completely inapplicable because you're using a fuel cell or h-c fuel... .... well, i'm going to *assume* it'd be a serial design.... fuel cells aside (for the moment), that using some sort of ICE, said ICE is powering an onboard generator... onboard generator is hooked up to capacitors... and cap's are powering the electric motors.

if the design is made in a modular fashion... the ICE could be swapped out *with* a fuel cell.  and, in turn, the fuel cell could be swapped out for batteries.   after all, it's electricity going to the caps... (and/or batteries) ... so, to make the 'core' energy source compartmentalized in a design in such that it could be 'swapped'

it'd be like dropping a generator (a standard bought-it-at-lowes depot) generator into a compartment... (on the ICE or fuel cell design... the ability to carry a second fuel tank would be awesome too!) ...  hooking up the cable.. and closing the compartment before starting it up and sending it on its way.

I suppose the point is, 'modularity of design' such as to offer versatility in what the customer wants... and, in such a way that the customer can swap it out or add on more as they see fit.

obviously something like [this](http://geeknizer.com/worlds-smallest-petrol-engine/) or [this](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2001/04/02_engin.html) are more for 'in the lab' b.s. ... but, 

well, you get the idea.  tiny ICE or fuel cells with 'expandable' tanks... that can be swapped for batteries.... combined with the ability to allow for more, larger batteries to be added on... ...in such a way as to extend time   range, as well to allow for 'fast swapping' or 'refueling' so it can get up and go again.

obviously [this one](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/the_miniature_fuel_cell) is a bit dated ... ...and [this one from 2013](http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2013/01/31/why-are-portable-fuel-cells-such-a-flop/) probably isn't much more recent...

but, in the end, it's been clearly proven that electric motors can be massive (nuclear submarines, diesel-electric hybrid trains, nuclear powered aircraft carriers, etc) ... ...and can move a LOT of weight.   and that, well, *with* diesel-electric hybrid trains *being* an example... that h-c chains can store a lot of energy in a small space, provide that energy to a conversion system (fuel cell, ICE, etc)... and that that, in turn, can produce a lot of electricity to power said motor...

the rest is just design, proper configuration, etc.

...and having the money, time, incentive, and application-necessitating to put it all together...

just as applicable to UAVs and ground-based drones, imo... as those other.   applied to agriculture?

well, again, 200lbs is awesome.  hell, 20lbs is awesome.  I work in real estate development (construction) with mom's side in ag, farm, etc ... and, both grew up on the farm as often as possible, as well am out there multiple times a week.  so, i see both worlds.  The ability to lift 200lbs?  or, hell, 100lbs... with the other 100lbs taken up by a quick-energy system (swap batteries, extra fuel tank, etc??) ...  I've carried more 50lb boxes of nails to the 3rd floor of a house across a rough construction site more times than i care to think about .... on hot humid days in downpour rain.. or where it just finished raining... ...the ability to fly shit up to the top of a house like this??   .... how many saws have we broken throwing the extension cord up 30ft and having the guy lift the saw up by the cord only for it to break at 28ft and fall... destroying a $150 dewalt???  or had a dude out in the middle of a roof that's barely held up... trying to tie it all together but needs a level to do so and had to throw one up only for him to miss, nearly fall himself, and the level fall and bust, break, and otherwise cease to function??

or, been out on the backass part of the farm, on the phone with someone at the house or in the garage or the barn .. or walkie talkie... and said 'I need that part' ... only for it to then take 30 minutes for them to get it or.. have them say 'i'm lookin' at it right here... holdin' it in my hand in fact' ... only to have to pack up, drive across a field... fuck up alignment, balancing, etc etc... get it... and then haul ass back to get whatever finished up so I can get the hell on with my day ... ...vs just telling the drone to autopilot home... get loaded up, then autopilot back to wherever the hell I am.

hell, beer delivery service for fishing!   walkin' down to the creek takes at least 10 minutes.  walkin' back up the hill at least 15-20.  carrying beer? pain in the ass!

run out of beer? fuck!   vs bust out the drone, or, just have someone at the house bust out the drone, load in the beer... and fly it to the creek :)   the farm's 200 years old, the shit on it hasn't moved in decades-to-centuries. I can program in a safe flight path.

tons of application on that. apologies for the rest of the rant.

 200lbs is crazy!  So is an hour flight time!...20lbs or not! 




 Yeah, the 'law of accelerated returns' is definitely beginning to apply itself to drones....

....but, so much of what would be awesome if developed.. ...so much of what I've rambled about (for instance), is dependent on *so* many variables outside of just the drones.

the drones are just one of the pieces tying other elements together.

but, that also means that parallelism can happen in the development... with advances happening on *multiple* fronts at once.

but, I still think it will take years-to-decades (if ever) before it's all really put together .. if ever.

but, even as most of it currently sits, *I* can see no real technological limitation to *any* of it ... even now.  sure there will be advances that will make it all the more 'effective', cheaper, widely deployable, ...widely utilizable... ...but, as it currently sits, it's more just a matter of 'putting it all together'.. ...then advancing it generation after generation.   I definitely don't see any *single* company rising to the tops... and, in fact, see a major benefit happening from multiple, independent ideas, lines of development, both working together *and* competing against one another... in such that a building off of one another takes place.    kinda-sorta like the development of Linux.

...let's just hope that *like* Linux, most of the advancements don't get *too* tied down in patent b.s.     ...that could really stifle it.

but, I also think that '$75m' is just the first of many times that to come down the line.   ... in such that, I wouldn't be surprised (though, not really sure I'd want to place a bet on it) that AgDrones won't be a $1billion+ (a year) industry by 2025-2030.   ... or, at least drones in general.  but, can't put it all just on aerial drones.  it's a lot easier to roll something across the ground than get it aloft and move it through the air ... 

but, also, energy...  h.c.-electric hybrids are going to be where it's at in my personal opinion ... and, for the most part, that means larger drones.   ... despite advancements in shrinking combustion engines down to size.   ... fuel cells could come into play too... ...but, if those haven't come out for cars yet, ... and that's already a clearly established industry .. ..then the likelihood that they'll move forward on drones first is.... ....less-than-likely.  though, maybe drones could be where that type of development *does* get deployed earlier... *then* start rolling up   out to cars??

I know I'd much rather fill up a tank with some compressed n.gas or, simply, diesel or gasoline than sit around waiting for countless batteries to charge up.  

but, the industry will definitely benefit from it even if it tech froze today and just-what's-out-there-now became more widely utilized. so...exciting times! :)

 Luke was walking with ag-droids decades ago. the concepts are nothing new.... ....the technology is finally catching up.

but... as such, I still imagine it'll take years if not decades... ....and decades to perfect itself even *if* ['the big drone companies are investing millions to create new drone startups'](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/27/8664293/skyfund-airware-drone-funding-dji-accel)

nothing talked about here is 'easy' to do... ....but, dump a few deca-million into something and you can be *damn* sure there'll be people paid to search what's already been written on the subject and consolidate it...   ....and, '10's of millions' *usually* has a habit of becoming hundreds of millions ... -then billions... ... so, the future is coming ... ....how long it takes to get here though we'll have to wait   see

  You are somewhat out of touch with the state of the art

oh, of that I have *no* doubt ... it's a 'hobby' to me... not something I super-actively keep up with.   

 John Deer makes a ground drone as a lawn mower, runs just like a roomba.

...but, if *this* is an example of 'state of the art' ... I'm up on it :P

I really think that ground-based drones are under-developed   underfunded 

I mean, look at what's happening with aerial drones.   look at what's happening with self-driving cars.  let me reword that for emphasis:  look at what's happening with one of the number 1 methods of death on the planet.   we're not just talking about, but are actually putting people into computer-controlled cars and speeding them along on pothole riddled streets with 'countless' barely-predictable variables  .... 


.....we have walking robotic 'dogs' ... ....we have self-steering tractors...  ....but we don't have a 5mph robo-drone deal that has 5 gallons of diesel fueling a generator that, in turn, powers electricity to a track-drone that goes down rows of crops taking soil samples, testing moisture content, spraying rows, mapping topography, laying irrigation lines, placing sensors, or countless other menial tasks?

I'm not 'attacking' aerial drones so much as implying that doing something in the air seems even *harder* to do than doing something on the ground ... ...and, tying the two together??

 scarecrow

this will be hilarious to see!  I've watched more than one territorial bird attack a quadcopter before.  

 draw insects away

I tied a flashlight to my drone and flew it over my backyard as a sort of 'overhead light source' while I was wrapping up stuff one night ... bugs started flying around it like crazy!

 Drones can carry quite a bit of weight. Here is a video of a quadcopter lifting a 5 gallon bottle of water (22kg).

no link.  but, unless you're feeling motivated, don't worry about it .... ...and, yeah, I have *no* doubt they can carry it.. ...it's more a matter of 'for how long?'   ....  I still think there's something to this 'tethering' deal... ground-based power source (track drone rolling around with a 5kw diesel generator with 5+ gallon fuel tank....  connected to a tether connected to a drone overhead providing it 'near-endless' energy)

 Ground drones have an advantage over aerial - they can be solar charges and sit out in the field waiting for a task based upon what the farmer directs from info that came from an aerial.

or they can be petro-fueled, or n.gas ... and be programmed to auto-drive into the barn if they get below x-gallons/cfu's of fuel.  

it's less the possibility for these and more just creating them with enough tasks to justify a probably-hefty price tag.  ...esp initially.

 separate drones for different tasks

as well, separate attachments for the *same* drone... ...for different tasks. 


I'm totally optimistic about this... ...and, I think the tech is *more* than there already .. ...it's just a matter of getting it put together, getting it put in place, and making it available.. ...in a realistic price range... for the customer.

I think the first target markets can/should/will be the 'hobby farmer' .. the millionaire doctor who owns 500 acres surrounding their 'pre-retirement farmhouse'  ... I know more than a few doctors with x-hundred acres and a gorgeous house on the outskirts ... with condos in the city.

.... and equipment that cost *way* more and that does *way* more than they could *ever* need it to do.. ...who would *love* to brag to their friends about their robodrone.. ....  if sitting in their 8th floor office downtown and being able to 'log into' their ground (or aerial) drone and drive (or fly) it around via their computer ... while making their next patient wait in the office to find out they're cancer-free ... or going to die in a few months if they don't have this $50k chemo treatment... .... well, I think they'd eat that shit up!

make it ipad controllable over the internet?  or iphone controllable?  and they can show their doctor buddies or medtech slaves the 5 acres of vineyard they (had) put up over the weekend to help them win 2018th's red ribbon in the annual wine tasting competition?

yeah... trust me, they'll eat. that. shit. up!   I went to the wine deal here last year (my buddy's a ribbon winner every year) ... a few of the vineyard booths advertising their grapes had tablets set out on the table playing videos they'd had made to show off their farm/vineyard ... included drone footage of the whole farm.   talk about a subculture that likes to brag!  ...and is tech-competitive as *fuck*!

you get the idea.. i'm *well* beyond the point of babbling at this point

  This is a GREAT with a capital G list.

was just stream-of-thought thinking about it.  I'm sure if I spend some time thinking about it I can come up with a better one. but, thanks! :)

 I just posted an answer to another that address some things.

I saw your other post after I refreshed the page.   check out the edits I did to the above post if in case I did them *after* you saw the 'first draft'

your post had some things in it I *hadn't* thought about, namely the microfertilization.

personally I see this as being *way* off, but maybe/hopefully I'm wrong.    I mean, I suppose much of it comes down to power source ... thus, how much weight a drone can carry, how complex they can become, etc ... ...i mean, I *suppose* you could have a 'big drone' flying overhead feeding supplies to a smaller drone connected via a tether   tubing system that can spray xyz directly onto a needed plant...

to take your pest thing farther... with ultrasonic, radar, and other 'imaging' approaches, I'd imagine even *insect* identification could go on ...and, subsequent   directed spraying.   so, caterpillars on your leaves? beetles going crazy?  spray 'em!    ??? 

but, I see much of that as being *really* far out .. if ever

I totally agree with you on the first steps basically being an imaging thing ... ...a carry over from the enthusiastic photographer-drone op.  

I mean, with the right regs in place, there's really no reason drones couldn't be 'suv-sized' .... on down to these smaller pocket-sized drones....    i've always been curious about a 'drone tether' ...  like, high gauge speaker wire running between a larger drone to a smaller one powering it...   or just powering drones with cables to begin with.... I mean, a microUSB 3.0 cable is pretty small, and some are much lighter than others, and those things can pump out 100w .... ....if the cable is being supported by a hydrocarbon-fueled 'mother drone' and smaller ones are simply drawing the power from them (ie, hovering *below* them vs above them) ... then 'swarms' of drones could work together (tethered or not) to cover a few different angles of it.

um...  but yeah, i'm of the opinion that it's definitely going to take an denser fuel source, and nothing's as dense as hydrocarbons... [except nuclear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials). ... so a drone with an onboard generator powering smaller one *could* make sense?   I mean, right now I think a lot of the view is on 'standard' drone sizes... but, with the right regs in place, why *not* have a 'car-sized' [drone hovering](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-hoverbike-is-basically-a-giant-quadcopter-drone) supplies overhead.   I think the idea of dumping water from above is obviously just ridiculous... but, 'swarming' software tying a few different drones together? with a 2-3 hour energy source? how is that completely unrealistic?

 Auto take of an landing is coming

I think this will be a big part... and, I'll take it farther.    I mean, my roomba can automatically take itself back to its charging station, why can't a drone use similar software and automatically land in an area that automatically connects it to a charge or refill station?    more than that, the ability to automatically pick up different fuel tanks or spray tanks....   I know on the one hand this sounds absolutely absurd but... if it can go back to a certain point automatically then land... ...and do so on a V-shaped thing that naturally 'drops' it into place in such that a 'nozzle' or something injects fuel into it (think air compressor hose or something... with the fuel being n.gas or something 'like' that) ... ....why not have another similar with a tank of fertilizer or pesticide?  

on the one hand, this sounds absurdly expensive and totally niche.  on another though... vineyards are *huge* and can make a *lot* of money.  the ability to automate a spraying of a 5'000 acre vineyard???    you say 400mph, but even 25mph or 40mph to get from a field back to a barn back out to the field again ... and while the farmer stays out in the field tending to other things until it gets back?       which brings in simple 'delivery drones Amazon-style'     have a barn with some guys in it, out in the field fixing something. run out of a $2 box of staples fixing a line and have to load your shit up in the truck, drive 10 minutes back to the barn, get it, only to drive back ... vs send the drone to the barn, guy in barn gets called/radioed in to throw in the box... and the drone flies back.   the time/energy saved in something like that is *huge*    .... something like that could eat up 20-30 minutes easy... vs take '5 minutes' for a drone... *while* the guy in the field is still doing his deal.  and the only thing *that'd* require is a drone that can carry an x-lb payload and fly a predetermined path... and back again.   throw that on a guy making $35/hr and do that just 1x a week.... let alone a few times a *day*?  and for a *few* guys out in a field making that or similar?    savings add up pretty quickly.    ...and, again, nothing more complex than an 'Amazon delivery drone' to do something like that.

 Flying between rows is not what aerial drones do well 

not *yet* ... but, with the sensors you mention above?  I think they *could*.    *why*? is another question... but, between grape rows, just check out the [vine rangers](http://www.vinerangers.com/) vid... between corn rows... obviously there isn't a *huge* cost advantage to this... but, take something like the DJ's prop guards... make them a tad more complex whereby the entire blade is surrounded.. then covered top   bottom with a light weight screen... ...i'm not sure how this would mess with aerodynamics but... ..in such that the unit is protected... then fly it along?   ...reinforced by sensors, of course for flight path and such....


then there's the 'drone' element that *isn't* flight-based drones.  I think there's just as much potential for ground drones to do just as much...and the two working in unison feeding information back   forth... drone on the ground... potentially with much greater power supply... tethered to a drone flying directly above it?  .... going down a row or a line?  monitoring soil *and* aerial data at the same time?   obviously these could be done wirelessly... as well done at separate times and the data stitched back together, but for accuracy's sake, the ability to do both at the same time *seems* like it could drastically cut down on the cost of sensors spread throughout.   and, again, the energy-capability if it's, say, a vineyard where the rows are far enough apart that a power-tether wouldn't get hung up on leaves and such.

I know the focus is on aerial drones but.... that limits things a *lot*.

I'll check out the links. 




 Just a list?

- automation

    meaning: I want to be able to program a path... either via a map, a recorded flight that I 'train' it to do, whatever.... and then every day at preset times, it will send me a text message or app notification, I say 'go ahead' or 'delay' (in case it's raining.. and assuming it hasn't tied into local weather or something) ... ..and, basically, it'll fly along that path and record every day..  ...w/out me (really) having to do shit.

- different fuel sources than just batteries

    fuel cells, the ability to cover much wider areas (fields can get pretty big, and depending on the level of accuracy ... it may take more than a standard 20 minute path)    ....  fuel cells or something *like* that would be nice.

- automatic take off and landing... for recharging

     so if a preprogrammed flight is going to take 10 recharges to do throughout the day... it can go, do its deal, fly back to base, charge, then fly back out again and pick up where it left off (my roomba can do this)

- local 'grid' accuracy

    *like* a Roomba's 'walls' or whatever, something that lets me place sensors around the fields, the rows, etc to create markers.... be them solar powered, rfid, whatever.  the cheaper the better. 
  but, something like this to create a more accurate area so that I can more precisely lay out the physical area of the farm and paths I want covered

- sensor tie-in

    If I place sensors around the farm... moisture levels, shade coverage, that sort of thing... .... a mesh network would be nice whereby the sensors can connect to one another, and then to wifi access on the farm to get data to me.   if this isn't available... a remote farm, something like that... ...the drone can 'RFID-ping' the sensors, record the data... and bring it back in such that it'll auto-hook up to a computer or be accessible over wifi or upload the data to an online account when the drone auto-returns to the barn or house or garage or wherever

- take a vineyard as an example

   the ability to fly both above rows... as well *between* them

- take a corn field for example

   the drones would need to have their blades covered so as to *not* get tied up... yet still be effective .... and, fly *between* rows of corn to take assessment of below-canopy crop health


- more than just imaging and sound

  this one gets tricky but... heat, moisture recording, etc

    this ties more into software that isn't drone-specific, obviously, but the ability to do radar for picking up soil erosion, moisture content, etc.  


- livestock focused

    if the tags on livestock could be RFID and 'pingable' from the drones to know where they are, track movements of them, etc.  

  Lets say there are 20 animals in a field, each tagged with RFID, each with their own serial/barcode number.  A map of the field has already been made and programmed into the drone's software... drone knows to go fly a preprogrammed path along that map, counting the head (ie, pinging the tags and filling in a database).  lets say 15 of them are all in one area but 5 are separated from the herd.    ...the drone would not only 'know' which 15 are there / which 5 aren't... and would then fly the preprogrammed path for that field to 'find' the other 5...   once all 20 are found, fly back w/out wasting more time/energy on it.   if 19 are found but there's a 20th gone astray... fly the path until it finds it.  after x-minutes *not* finding it... send a notification ...  or if it's lost, out of the area, etc, send notification that it's not in the area and... well, smartphone alert making the 'shepherd' aware that one of their flock has gone missing. 


a lot of this ties into *other* sensor grids that could be set up on a farm... and, lots of other technologies beyond *just* drones *but*... the drone could play a *critical* part in enhancing this


- to act as a temporary wifi repeater ....

    so, if i have a grid set out on a farm but it's too far away from the barn or what not to download data... .. to be able to fly out and connect to it, but not just download data (or upload it) ... but also to tie that part of the grid to the drone... then the drone, in turn, to bridge to the barn or what not...

...though, this is largely silly, but it'd still be nice software to have in the drone ... given that the drone *may* be network-connected-capable so why *not* include something similar.

but, the idea is the drone could go to an area, hover for x-minutes until the data is downloaded, *know* that the data is downloaded, then move on.     obviously this is also redundant with just going out and downloading the data itself and bringing it back.



but, definitely longer flight time and more-capable energy source.  that 4hr fuel cell drone posted the other day would definitely be necessary


- irrigation monitoring

  lets say there's drip irrigation installed... the ability to fly down a line and 'see' whether or not the drips are dripping... sprays are spraying, etc.   be able to detect the moisture of the lines in such as to know it isn't just moisture on leaves but actual spray coming out... ie, to let know if there's a clogged or broken line.


those are the ones that pop up in my head.

 I just read the wikipedia on it, obviously not the same thing, but given the amount of time I have to dedicate to the subject it'll have to suffice.

Regardless, I was being sarcastic above. I'm personally of the opinion that Israel clearly *does* have nuclear weapons, and that it's both hypocritical and should be brought to the forefront of any talk with or about Israel.

Nuclear weapons are *the* weapon of mass destruction, and any   all who have them should be held accountable *for* possession of them.

It's not like we're talking about chemical weapons or daisy cutters... These things are largely designed to level *cities*...let alone entire bases or entrenched underground facilities.

It's morally   ethically irresponsible for *any* country or 'other' possessing them to *not* be forthright about such.

But, that's just my opinion and, quite frankly, it means squat in any real scheme of things relative to this.

But, to blast Iran for *potentially* developing them while *not* remaining 100% clear about their *own* situation is laughably hypocritical at best, and completely unacceptable somewhere in the middle.

 oh yeah, holding off is definitely a must.... for me at least.

like, even if this shit were available here, now, today... i'd still probably wait a bit.   ...even for Lasik (*with* wavefront/mapping) I'd still probably hang back a bit... ...unless i was like glasses 24/7 or something.  then i'd definitely get that shit tomorrow (it's 7pm now so...) ....

....but, as is, I don't even wear glasses so... 


but, on the other... yeah, i mean, if i could take my eyes now, get these put in ... ...why not?  'cause it *reads* like they could be removed pretty easily and things could heal back to normal ... thus, 'upgrades' would be allowed.

...but, in the future, I wouldn't be surprised at *all* if they had this... and combined it with like transparent monitors or lazers or something that wrote images on the retina... ....so, i could see optically what's going on ... or, if need be, it could 'record' an image, then write it on my retina in a majorly zoomed-in way .. and, not just 'zoomed-in optical frequencies' ... but pretty much anything ... Predator-style.

 like, if they can show it on a monitor, they can write it to your retina.     that shit'll be fun!   really great at parties! :P

I wouldn't be surprised if they get to the point they can put something right on the optical nerve.  I've definitely read where they're working on that.... how far along they are is 'anyone's guess' though 

but, some Jordi (sp?) shit from star trek would be pretty f'in cool too!    ... w/out that ugly ass visor, of course 




 lol.... well, *normally* ClickHole's fucking hilarious ... but, that one's actually the 'most serious' one I've ever read from them..

like, it's still a joke, but technically, mathematically, everyone of them rough-calculation works out to be true.  it still made me crack up.. but i'm pretty sure I was crying in disgust at the same time

was awesome! a real rollercoaster of emotions.  kinda like skydiving 




 [potash](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/agrium-cuts-earnings-expectations-to-bottom-of-earlier-guidance/article16425506/) is an industry 




 there was a [potash glut](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/agrium-cuts-earnings-expectations-to-bottom-of-earlier-guidance/article16425506/) going on... I imagine it'll only continue to grow with projects like this.

but ash has its own issues.  applying it directly to the soil shoots the pH way up and throws everything off.   and, though mixing it with compost works...  i highly doubt farmers are wasting the time to spread compost over a field that they're only going to grow straw in 




 hopefully sooner than that!  

as far as 'body augmentation' goes... I'd much rather get one of these than, say, a tattoo...

most of my family's had lasik (bro, sis, mom), as well a few friends.

my brother got his back in its 'earlier' days (~2000?) ... my mom   sis were 2005? 2006?

my brother was too early for it when he got his... he had to go back for one readjustment in like 2003, and then the next one he went in he got the wave front shit (wave mapping, wave front ... it goes by different 'brand names' but it's essentially all the same tech).

my sister just got the standard... *despite* me telling her to get wave mapping ... my mom went a year later and I *made* her get wave front.  like, she got an appointment at the same place my sister got hers... I called them up, researched their 'wave front' tech they were using, found a better place that was using a newer approach (read: machine) doing it... called *them* and scheduled an appointment for my mom, cancelled her other one. 

manipulated the situation such that I told my sis I'd take my mom...  picked her up day-of, drove her to this *other* place... knew she'd fight it at first... but, told her to go in, give it a chance and if she didn't like it, I'd pay for the other place's entirely...  once we got there she begrudgingly sat through waiting room deal (~15 minutes?) and what not... (god was she pissed!) ... but, after we got in there and the doc explained the differences to her between the tech they were using, etc ... she realized 1) the doc was better and 2) the tech was better.

I ended up paying for it all anyway ... just because she's my mom... ...but, my sister has since had to go back to get hers readjusted 3x and now has to wear glasses while night driving or reading anything longer than a menu... ...my mom (older) has had one readjustment.. and the doc says she has about 3-4 more to go.  my sis is 'readjusted out' and they say that even with the wave mapping, they *may* be able to only get one more readjustment in on her... but recommend holding it off for a *while* ... like, years-to-decades ... like, in case shit gets 'really bad' again 

um... my mom? can still see great and doesn't ever need glasses (despite being almost 70).

but, I suppose the point of my story, if there even is one, is... it's your freakin' eyes! only the best! if anything at all! 

luckily i'm still pretty much 20/20 (used to have slightly higher... like 20/22 in one eye, 20/23 in another... was awesome and shooting! I've slacked off in the past decade though... but I used to be able to put rounds through the same holes.. or just slightly off.. probably still could but breathing techniques and rhythm gets thrown off from 'old age') ... but, yeah, I'm prob 20/20 - 20/18 at this point.  I'll definitely get the wavefront ... and, this shit (if available) if/when/as I ever go to get my eyes 'adjusted'.

Hopefully it's out by then.  I'd have *no* qualms getting this put into my eye... even to*day* if it were available.  ...though, I'd prefer the tech to advance a bit more first.

but, the cool thing about this *vs* the other (and the two can totally be combined together from what I gather) is that *un*like lasik (wave mapping or not), this is an insert ... so, i'm going to imagine it can be 'adjusted', removed, replaced, or 'other' as tech advances and as the eye ages.     .....granted, I'm no optometrist but my grandfather passed at 89 and never needed glasses.  ... I get that a shitload of it is genetic... but also that a shitload of what happens from there is dietary or situational/conditional to how you use your eyes.  

[this  article](http://wgntv.com/2015/05/25/optometrist-claims-to-invent-lens-3x-better-than-20-20-vision/) *ends* with saying 'it could be available by 2017'  ...though, probably more like 2027  ... just in time with when I'll probably need my first Lasik'ing :) 




 It's real. I first read about it back in early-to-mid 2002.  Was in a Forbes or Fortune (I'd send a link if I could find one) piece that was covering war-tech worth investing in.

Like a lot of advanced tech being worked on at the time, it all got classified or re-classified by lil'Bush.

My guess is, before Obama gets out, one of the last things he'll do is de-classify a shitload of military tech that'll *flood* the market over the next presidential term.  Really surprised why he hasn't done it *yet* ... but, then, there actually *has* been some 'creep' over the past few months ... more so than the past few years at least  (from what I've seen).

But, yeah, this got classified because it was being used for snipers.   or, well, that's what the Fortune/Forbes article said.  ... was saying something like 20/30 vision or something for the average person (or, they can see at 30ft what the average person can see at 20... forget which side the numbers fall on) ... but the the average sniper was like 20/25  (or 25/20) ... and the olympic ones were like 20/27-20/28  (or 27/20-28/20... you get the point) ...  obviously a lot more goes into sniping than *just* eye sight but... it plays a pretty critical part.   ... and that these took *every*one who used them (with normal vision) up to 20/30... and that with certain tweaks, advancements, etc, they were looking like they could get up to 20/40 if they had the proper funding to advance the science ... ...again, it *was* a business magazine .. promoting investable companies for war-tech. so, to show not just an already-existing market for already-existing tech/product .. but a longer term investment play too with promise of future advances for ... future customers.

anyway... but yeah, it's real.   and, from what I gather, it's going to advance farther ... like, when combined with wave front and such...  ....like, tailor-made, eye specific lenses... combined with continued advances in the tech.   should get really interesting

edit: but, just google 'bionic eye' and you'll get dozens of other sites covering it 




 good article.    ...for an industry piece.

 My M8 does this... I *love* HTC's stock keyboards... they're by far the best keyboards I've used on a phone.. and I've downloaded the others to play with them. 

but, ever since they (unfortunately) updated it and removed the ES/EN key to the left of the spacebar (to toggle between english   spanish) ... and replaced it with the keyboard key on the far right... i find myself hitting that thing all the time...

...and, when I do, it pops up the Google keyboard, HTC keyboard, Swype option.

I'd *much* rather have the seemingly-useful-for-someone-who-types-in-spanish (I don't, unless I'm telling bad jokes) or otherwise never-in-the-way EN/ES button  than this freakin' annoyance.


though... my guess is, it sounds like you've swapped keyboards and I'd imagine the new keyboard you swapped it for *doesn't* have that 'keyboard' button on the far bottom right.

...this assuming that the M8 and the M9 have the same keyboards, of course.

 I use Sprint's wifi calling all the time ... all but *have* to in certain parts of my house.   ...but it has limitations.

on *both* of my phones (HTC M8 and LG G3) it drops the wifi signal constantly.  I've swapped the router.. still does it.  I also have Sprints AirRave deal ... which works only about 1/3rd of the time the wifi doesn't.

Pretty much every outgoing phone call, I have to turn off then back on the wifi-calling deal... wait for it to reconnect, *then* place my call. 

if the call goes on longer than an hour, it will drop instantly. then I have to do it all over again before I can remake the call.

granted, it only ever takes 30 seconds to reconnect but... if the other person calls me *in* that 30 seconds, I either have to *not*-answer ... wait for the wifi calling to reconnect, then call them back and claim connection issues ... ...or answer it and just avoid the parts of my house with shitty coverage.

as far as answering an incoming call.... the same: I either answer it and avoid the areas of my house with shitty coverage or.... I don't answer it, connect to wifi, then call them back... 

and, this is on both phones and I've used two different routers to do this with... so I'm guessing it's *not* the routers, as I don't (seem to) have any problems with my other devices ...  ...  and, well, the air rave deal... it works great ... ...when it works, but I actually get *better* coverage with my wifi once its up vs if i go in my basement or something the signal from the AirRave can drop to a bar or two... vs my wifi is pretty much always full-bars everywhere in my house.


I suppose my point is: yeah, wifi calling is awesome (it really is, the call quality is far superior to even the HD-quality the AirRave gets when it can) ... when it works.  but it still has a ways to go before 'perfection' ... in my experience.

...but, *that* it's still in its first-gen phones (or, now 2nd gen with the M9/G4/S6 lines coming out) ... and many carriers don't even offer it yet ... ...I suppose it's a bit premature to be *too* hard on it.

but, on a business call with it dropping like that?  it can become *quite* frustrating! 

oh, and, the obvious limitation of *both* setups (AirRave *and* wifi-calling) that you can't originate a call on wifi/airrave then leave ... ...w/out dropping the call.

also, coming into range of the wifi/AirRave doesn't mean you autoconnect to those networks...

so, definitely there, but definitely still needing some 'tweaking' to get working right.

 Clark lowered dialogue too.... ....but, imo, 2001 was a *lot* more 'profound' of a movie ... *esp* for the time... than Interstellar.

Interstellar was like 2001 for children.  if even that.

and, given the half century of scifi since... I'd really've imagined it'd cover a *lot* more ground than just a stargate to an area near a blackhole ... and then a blackhole event horizon that became a survivable '5th dimension' of infinite possibilities.

really a piss poor movie, imo.   scifi for children.  'Gravity' in deep space.  it'll date poorly, imo.  esp as the equipment used (cameras, etc) become 'main stream' over the next few years/decades.

what would've been a lot neater?  something that tried to give an idea of just. how. much. 'nothing'. there is in space.

Why go to a planet that could cost you decades when Plan A's goal is to save those on a 'dying' earth. How the gravitational forces of a black hole would crush a ship faster than a coke can at the bottom of an abyss.
How a frozen cloud wouldn't float esp with the weight of a spaceship on it...even *on* a planet with 80% the gravity of earth. How the energy needed for escape velocity couldn't be contained in a ship of that size without dumpable booster rockets...

 I know this has nothing to do directly with 'permaculture' but it was popular among lots of the same circles a few years ago and fig'd you all might find it of interest.

 I've met nearly a dozen people who's bosses give them a phone... but have apps on them that pretty much let them control everything about the phone. 

not just gps, texts, etc... not just keylogging, but they can turn on the cameras on the phone... stream if the connection is good enough, set it to record and upload if it isn't... ...turn on the mic, etc

the people say, 'the phone's free. of course i use it'.

crazy shit.   I know a few programs... like Mobile Spy and such can do similar, but I haven't messed with any personally for a few years.

We had some trucks my 'biz partner' wanted to keep track of and it was just easier to throw a $100 smartphone in the glove compartment and leave it plugged in...   could track where the truck was, thus the employees were... did gps logging, etc.   I can't remember if that version of Mobile Spy did audio and camera, but i *feel* like it did, but because the phone was in the glove compartment it didn't matter, there wasn't anything to hear really and *definitely* nothing to see...

but, my 'biz partner' has since gone batty, wife's divorced him, etc ... from the excessive paranoia the person's developed.   karma i suppose

 never noticed a problem with sun *nor* heat ... but I'd imagine both would help to dry it out faster? 




 I've used bleach before too, but rubbing alcohol seems to work just as well...and even better due to the fact I have multiple bottles scattered around my house as well keep one in my car for after hiking and such.

It doesn't smell as bad nor does the smell last as long either 




 I've had it worse... different but worse.

I'm 'deathly' allergic to poison ivy... yet I still go places such that I get it multiple times a year.

I would *never* let it get like that.  the 'cure' to poison ivy is rubbing alcohol.  as soon as it starts itching and you can tell its poison ivy, scratch the ever-living shit out of it and pour rubbing alcohol on it. ... 1) it'll never blister up like that and 2) it'll dry out and be gone in a day or two.

pop all those nasty ass blisters and alcohol the shit out of it.

 ...and, as an op, I don't disagree.  but as a 'buried' comment in response to a series of 'others'? why not?

totally understand the *not* having the time to watch a long documentary... but if you *do* find a chance, I think you'll be more interested by it than I gather you are having *not* watched it 




 it was a comment not a post... the post was different.

i'm assuming you're referring to the comment, right? and *not* the op? 




 I would've figured that it would be pretty simply deduced that what I was saying was with intent that it *would* apply to 9/11.

clearly I can't disprove the theory that it was caused by a DEM ... any more than you can prove that it *was* one. 




 I disagree... 'manipulating' the weather is different than straight changing it... and, imo, we've been doing a pretty noticeable job at doing *both* for quite some time now.

it takes a lot less energy to alter something than the system itself may actually contain; dykes, dams, wind farms, etc.

a board in flowing water can alter the system downstream quite noticeably, for instance.   I don't see it as 'creating a hurricane, tornado, 'whatever' as much as changing points along one course to lead it down another one.  It's all about creating paths of least resistance ... and that's something that I think we very much so *can* do. ...and are.

 [That's Impossible - Weather Warfare](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrcu9h_history-channel-that-s-impossible-weather-warfare_tech) 




 Don't get me wrong... I have no doubt 'scalar weapons' are capable of things like this ... and [other, wider alterations](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrcu9h_history-channel-that-s-impossible-weather-warfare_tech) to things we'd otherwise not imagine possible....


..... but, why take it there? Why not just 'assume' that there was an insurance policy on the building where the providers gave those insured a 'discount' on price if they implemented additional systems/measures that limited collateral damage?

Ex: if i have side-impact airbags, my insurance is cheaper. 

in such that, if a building is about to collapse (for 'whatever' reason... plane, earthquake, terrorist attack, tornado, 'whatever') ... instead of that building coming down in an uncontrolled manner and directly affecting other buildings that the policy would *also* have to cover...

....instead of having to risk the lives of demolitions experts going in to plant charges post-damage.... 

....just have the systems already installed to bring the building down in a controlled manner.

of course there would need to be protections against the public knowing about this... but that's nothing that a city... esp a city the size, with the complexity, and with the number of large buildings that NYC has... ...couldn't agree to do and to keep a secret within the upper political ranks, building codes, FEMA ordinances, etc.

For the sake of *not* raising a hooha over all the people that could've been 'potentially saved' as the building sit there in shambles... a decision to 'pull it' is made... *during* the heat of the attack... and, well, viola, building collapses.

from an insurance (*and* re-insurance) perspective, it was probably cheaper to do a pay out to the families of the deceased than to deal with countless *more* medical expenses... and *then* deal with payout towards those... and potential death likely associated with them.

I'm not saying that the technical capabilities to take down the WTCs... or any other building, fault line, or 'other' *doesn't* exist (I personally believe that it *does*) ... but there are simpler explanations for it.

colder in many ways ... because they're more widespread precalculated, and involve more parties.

also,... going with the idea that it *was* a conspiracy... the buildings *not* falling down *doesn't* have the same effect ... ....when you're trying to get 1) global sympathy and 2) populous support for multi-trillion dollar wars that will last well over a decade... ... an effect of that magnitude is all but necessary.   ...vs to buildings hit, f'ed up, *eventually* brought down (possibly) ... and, well, months to *years* of debate over whether or not to do so.


again... I believe it's technologically plausible that it happened the way the 'scalar weapon theory' purports... but, Occam's razor kinda leans me towards thinking thermite is the more likely cause

the top floors would just need to be designed *to* turn into dust in such that it's harder to predict where they'll fall ... vs the ones closer to the ground.
