 Google knows so much about me already, it seems futile to fight it.  You want my medical records too? Sure, why not?

g+ had that chicken and egg issue that a lot of networking products have. Nobody uses it, so there's no reason to use it.  



















 I love this show so much. 

I remember when it was announced I was like, "A Hannibal Lecter show on NBC? Wow, that's gonna suck." Boy, was I wrong. 

The show is just so horribly beautiful, it's almost unbearable sometimes. 




 Not really that spoilery. More about the general direction of S3 and some discussion of episode titles and character beats. 




 The Thirteenth Floor(1999) is pretty much the exact same premise at The Matrix, people living in a computer simulation and unaware of it. 

It's (loosely) based on a book from 1964 called Simulacron-3. I read that book twenty years ago because I had heard that it was a proto-matrix story. In it, each individual's personality is saved on a giant, rotating storage drum. It's very cool, in that retro-future kind of way. 




 Is this really so confusing? A university has the power to kick a student out, either temporarily or permanently for any number of things, including things that are not crimes.  That's the extent of their jurisdiction and their power to enforce their rulings.

Were you thinking that I was implying a university does or should have the power to send someone to prison? 




 I've heard this quite a bit and it's not that simple. 

I think that it's reasonable to say that a university can and should take action in cases where the evidence for guilt isn't quite strong enough for a criminal conviction. Furthermore, I would argue that there are actions that might not rise to the level of a criminal complaint but could and should warrant a sanction of the offending party and/or protection of the victim. You can name any number of instances outside the sexual assault spectrum where this is true.

But trying to be fair in these cases is a really difficult problem. There are political pressures from all sides. The rules of how to proceed are wildly inconsistent. The people adjudicating the process generally don't have any training or expertise and can often be quite biased. No to mention that trying to fairly figure out what two drunken college kids actually did in a darkened room with no witnesses is nearly impossible. 














 Just a little salt, please.

I don't get the ketchup thing at all. 









 He was great as mob boss Theo Tonin on Justified. 




 It would be nice if occasionally judges were asked to resign because they sentenced an offender too harshly. 









 If I get this right, you were laid off, not fired for cause? So it's no big deal.  File for your benefits and don't worry about about.

Best of luck to you. 




 How are you eligible for unemployment benefits if you are working? 














 It's a decent word, but I'm not sure how I feel about it. 




 I don't get this. If someone is in your assigned seat, tell them to get up or get the flight attendant. 

How much of a pushover do you have to be to go, "Oh well, I guess I'll give up the seat I booked" because some entitled a-hole decided they don't have to follow the rules and can just do what they want because they're so special? 









 I just love that there's a company called General Atomics. Makes me feel like I'm living in an Issac Asimov story. 




 I think that's very true. The "loser pays" idea sounds great at first blush, but it puts plaintiffs with limited financial resources at a serious disadvantage. 

The better solution for patent reform would be to hire more and better patent reviewers and subject all proposed patents to a more rigorous investigation.  
























 I always find it fun and a little mind-boggling to talk about this stuff. 

I bought my first computer in 1983 with money I saved from my paper route. As an aside, there's another thing consigned to the dustbin of history, the paper route.

I got a Commodore 64. It cost me $300. The price had just been cut from $600 and I jumped right on that. I couldn't swing the money for a floppy drive, so I got the attachment that let me save my programs on a cassette tape. Later on I'd get the money for a real disk drive and a 300 baud modem. I was living in the future. 



















 I'd call that justifiable homicide. 




 I'm not sure where you are, but federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. That's roughly four and a tenth hours for thirty bucks, not three.

Either way, the law is clear. You must be paid for all hours worked.  If you feel that you'll be fired if you speak up, it may be in your best interest to keep quiet.

Perhaps you can approach your boss and ask him what he thinks the best course of action is. Tell him that to do the job correctly takes five hours, but you're not being paid for all that time. What would he like you to do?

You can always keep a written log of all hours worked. In fact, I would suggest this. Depending on the state you're in, the labor board may make the company make you whole when you leave the job. In most states, you'd have to sue.    




 Are you on payroll (w-2) or are you a 1099 contractor? 




 I'd say I'm half kidding. There is a lot of robot research in Japan that I think is partially due to this issue.  




 Solution 3 -  Robots 









 Aasif Mandvi too. Lot of heavy hitters on this show.  




 He's such an idiot. I'm looking forward to him getting shanked in prison.

Maybe Jonathan Banks will show up and send him to Belize.  




 Nothing is going to change until we start sending people who do this to prison. 

Fines are just a cost of doing business. If people start thinking they might actually have to spend some time behind bars for fraud, they might think twice. 



















 No, I saw the article on Google News this morning and decided to post it.

Not everyone on Reddit is a karma whore. 














 Not a surprise, sad to say. The numbers were terrible, even for NBC.

I had some small hope they might keep it and perhaps retool because otherwise they'd be the only network not in the Marvel/DC superhero universe. I'm not sure what characters they got to include in the show, but they hinted about more than a few. 

The supernatural side of the DC universe could make some interesting TV. 














 It's kind of amazing to me that we have military bases named after men who broke their oaths to support and defend the Constitution and took up arms against the lawfully elected government of the United States. 









 Seems legit. 




 This is the first real movie I remember watching with my daughter and it instantly became her favorite. I think it's maybe the best movie for children ever made.

And it's almost infinitely rewatchable. It never gets old or annoying.  Something you'll appreciate as a parent because littlers love to watch the same thing over and over and over again. 














 "Yes, it's hilarious. I don't have to laugh to think it's funny" 




 Yeah, I just don't agree. 

The McNulty arc was just plain stupid. The newspaper story was boring. A lot of the characters did dumb things that I just didn't believe they would do. I really felt the hand of David Simon moving the characters around in very unnatural ways to suit the story he wanted to tell and the sledghammer of message he wanted to hit the audience with.

I never watched The Wire when it was first on. I got caught up a couple years ago when Cablevision got HBO GO and I binged the whole sixty episodes in the span of two months. So I took the show as it came and I didn't have a lot of time to chew over the episodes or get attached to the show the way a lot of people did. 

I think sometimes people get attached to great shows like The Wire and they make excuses when they end poorly.  




 I appreciate you addressing this, but at this time I still don't feel confident that I can buy a used/refurb phone from eBay or whatever and have it work. The refurb sellers like the one I bought I bought my current Ting phone from flat out state in their listings that their Sprint refurbs are not for use on Ting or similar MVNO carriers.

The whole thing is a mess and I just don't know what to do at this point except shell out  money that I don't have for a brand new phone direct from Ting.  




 My The Wire season rankings are
4
3
1
2
(big big gap)
5

Sadly, The Wire S5 is just bad (imho) for a lot of reasons. Maybe you'll like it more than I did. 




 I remember watching the old 80's Buck Rogers show using an electronic perfection game as some kind of control console. It was funny because they didn't even modify it or paint it and I had the exact same game sitting right next to me. a

Edit:

Here it is:

 Corman's movie cost a reported two million dollars to make. By making it, the studio retained the FF's movie rights.

How much do you think those rights would go for today if they were to be sold on the open market? How much would Marvel/Disney pay to get them back? 









 Some professional sports teams sneak a "state of the art" clause in their stadium deal, forcing state and local governments to fund an unending series of upgrades and updates to their arenas addition to the huge expense of building the place in the first place. 




 I try to post links about this stuff from time to time, but there doesn't seem to be much interest here on /r/sports 














 I work in a very safety-conscious environment, so I'm always thinking about how things might fail in an unsafe way. I'd worry that people might want to use this like a sous vide machine, set it up and let it cook by itself for hours or days. 

Problem being, if the Meld has a glitch or fails in some bad way, you could easily have a bad fire.

Hopefully you'll include a strong warning not to let the Meld work unattended and perhaps a physical OFF switch so it can't turn on accidentally. You might also consider having it have the ability to send an alert/alarm to the user's phone if there's an issue or malfunction.

I think this is a very neat idea and if I hadn't exceeded my toy-buying budget for the nonce, I'd pre-order one. 

Good luck! 




 Can I still use the burner with the Meld knob as a regular burner?

Also, have you thought about safety concerns? Is there some kind of auto cut off if the temp goes too high? 









 My Anova sous vide stick can adjust to different volumes of water in the cook bath fairly easily. Modern PID controllers can do all kinds of neat things and they can actually be had fairly cheaply these days.

Cheap, easy-to-use, precision temperature control is going to revolutionize the way people prepare food.  









 If you're just counting years from the start of the show, you're clearly correct about the date.

On the other hand, the events in the last episode are clearly the Viking sack of Paris that happened in 845 in the Earth Prime timeline. Not to mention that Athestan's child with Judith is almost certainly Alfred the Great, which makes it 849 AD.

Furthermore, it seems like we're seeing Rollo being set up to be Rollo/Robert of Normandy,  which is even later down the timeline.

The show is basically a Viking Saga, so things like continuity and accuracy are not high on the lift of priorities. I just wouldn't get all hung up on what year it is. Just enjoy the ride. 




 Except that that's Charles The Bald on the throne in Paris and he won't even be born until 823.

My only point is that it's silly to try and talk about what the real year is in the show. It's a mishmash. It's like a show where the main character fights along side George Washington at Yorktown and a few years later he's hanging out with President Abe Lincoln and discussing the Gettysburg Address.  




 The show plays pretty fast and  loose with the time and events.

The show begins with the Viking raid on Linsdisfarne in 793 CE, but the events happening now take place in 845 CE. The Vikings, lead by the person who may or may not have been the historical Ragnar Lothbrok, raided Paris in 845. 

Hirst basically takes people and events from the late 8th through the late 9th century and squashes them all together as he likes to make the story.  




 The article calls it a patent, but other articles I've read refer to it as a trademark. Trademarks don't expire, as far as I know, so I was unclear as to what the actual issue is.

I used intellectual property because it seemed generic enough to cover whatever it might be. 









 My wife spent a lot of her summers there, right around that time period. I told her she should get a series bible and submit a spec script. 









 It's a kickstarter film and OP likely stole and posted the trailer, since it's a "backer only" premium right now.
