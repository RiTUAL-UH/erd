 There are lots of things you can do after you've built a profitable city. 

For example, try a different profit strategy. A different layout. Gift away some of your cash to make your vision of utopia (one that's a dream to live in, but may have to rely on continuing gifts). If you're not playing with others, perhaps take on an entire region by yourself and build all the different types of specialized cities (electronic, mining, oil, tourism, gambling ...).

In a way, you can't really win with games like SimCity. It's all about showing off your creativity, what you can do to make your city different from other people's. Some of the game mechanics do limit your freedom a lot, especially if you want sustainable cities, but if you do have a ton of cash that you can gift away, then that frees up some of the things you can do. 




 I have one city with 3 processor factories and 3 CE factories (all fully upgraded), with two trade ports (one via rail, one via shipping - probably don't need both, but might as well. Had to build two ports since the rail and water connections are at opposite ends of the map - but this is good, as it provides two paths for trucks to receive/deliver materials). Can easily do 4+ million per day. I'm importing all the needed materials, even processors, as that's the best way to ensure no disruption to manufacturing (you make less, but then factories less likely to shut down a few times a day as it runs out of materials).

For this 140k population city, one half of my city is basically all these factories and trade ports, and so the traffic there is mostly just trucks going from place to place.

I can probably add another 3 or 4 CE factories before I run out of free space, and before traffic issues becomes a bottleneck. 




 I had a problem with a city where recycling was doing fine, and then the number of recyclables dropped to almost zero (about 500 or so, but the trucks never leave their garages), and garbage went way up, even though education was still 4/5. 

Had to bulldoze and rebuild the recycling center to bring recycling demand back up again. Turning it off and then on had no effect.

This was before 2.0, but I don't see many people mentioning this bug, so it probably wasn't fixed in the patch.
