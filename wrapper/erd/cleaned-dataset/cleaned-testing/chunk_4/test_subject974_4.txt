 some seriously majestic moustaches. 




 pic in 1st comment 




 thanks for all the input - appreciate it. 




 I've been starting it w/ mesquite chunks early in the am and keeping it fueled all day until ready to cook - I mean it seems damn hot enough. 




 that's basically what I was going for w/ this post. 




 you lost me here: Wash the dal, add turmeric powder and a tsp of oil and pressure cook for 3 whistles

no water? and do I neeeed a pressure cooker? 




 I have no arm hair left. 




 never seen or heard of ridge gourd 




 looks yum! 




 my tandoor: http://i.imgur.com/98fHLzg.jpg 




 recently acquired an awesome tandoori over and my naan is not sticking to the walls - or it's sticking too much to my naan pillow - it's either the dough, my tandoor's too hot, or not hot enough...I dunno, anyone have a authentic, tried and true naan recipe? thanks 




 inspiring! I may do this w/ chicken this weekend - thanks! 




 I loved it as well - I wanted to fucking slap the shit outta that kid! which I think is what they were going for... 




 $80!? 




 \m/ 




 'bout half. 




 and another...

 dude I picked up the Swallowed cassette as well and it KILLS! I can't wait for my vinyl!!! Love Skull Fist as well! NO FALSE METAL! \m/  




 picked up The White Goddess from 20buckspin a while back and am not disappointed - besides, cheese is delicious! 




 new Obituary, Sacrificio, and various bandcamp discoveries... 




 is it explorable, or is that whole runway area fenced off? 




 One of my favorite parts of the day - when I get home after work I have like an hour and 20 before the wife gets home.  I hang out in the kitchen and spin vinyl.  Just got the new Obituary yesterday and was spinning that  - which is awesome. 




 the 2 week creeper...

 there ya go - good luck!

\m/ 




 was trying to get the basic recipe in the title... 









 awesome man lemme know! \m/ 




 it is...you know that perfect bite of pancake though? the one w/ just the right amount of syrup and a little crisp of bacon at the end...it's like that, only better. 




 RECIPE: http://www.ranchogordo.com/html/rg_cook_mondavi_tostada.htm 














 I recently went in on half a pasture-raised hog w/ a friend.  I home-cured some bacon recently and holy crap I will never go store-bought again.  We should def hook up when you get up here.  \m/ 




 how did it go by the way? 




 I like your bulk salad idea - what protein are you filling the crock-pot with?  




 would love that thanks 




 wtf do you do w/ kale - gimme a good, simple recipe and I'll try it...picked up our csa after work today and guess what?  3 KINDS OF KALE!!! 




 totally....listening to Reverend as I type. \m/ 




 I dunno, I've tried all the ones I mentioned - Bloomfield is cool cuz you can opt to just go out to the farm and pick everything yourself which is really neat (http://www.bloomfieldorganics.com/upick/) - we're just finishing our Twin Palms CSA now for the season which has been great.  I think we're just gonna do farmers markets for a while and see how that goes - too much fucking KALE lately. \m/ 




 competed in strongman for years but have slowed down...less weight more volume type stuff. 




 I've been training there w/ a buddy for 11 years...Mon-Fri 13:00-14:00 




 well obviously. 




 will it be recorded - for playback tomorrow for example? sounds awesome!
\m/ 




 that's where I am yo! the CD will be MINE!!!

\m/ 




 saw your post and instantly thought of that intro - thanks!

 sweet! just ordered the vinyl edish from dark descent! can't wait! \m/ 




 Wow, one of my favorite albums of all time.  I picked this up on cassette in 1989, at Warehouse Records in the Del Monte Shopping Center in Monterey, CA.  That was back in the day when you bought a tape just cuz it had a killer cover...no other reason. \m/ 




 so many great CSA's around here. Tierra, Twin Palms Ranch, Tara Firma, Bloomfield Organics just to name a few. 




 MylesAhead is all about O-lifting, not powerlifting.  I squat   pull @ Powerhouse. \m/
