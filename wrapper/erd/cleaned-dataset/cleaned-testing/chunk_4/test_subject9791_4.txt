 They need to alert Brock and Reigns to plan out a new finish to the match. Hence they needed all three at the same time for this. The Stomp = F5 = Spear = Stomp = pin looks like it was planned with detail, and won't happen if any one of them was out of the loop 




 They need to plan the cash in sequence with all three people for the finisher ballet to work. 




 Holy shit, it's only around 2 minutes from Rollins running down the aisle to him winning the belt?

watching it live, at the time it felt like 10 minutes to me 









 Meltzer believes that Lesnar was fully informed of the new plan before he signed his new contract last Tuesday.

This I think is the most crucial part of that. It shows that the creative already had it planned, but kept it from both Seth and Reigns. The decision might even be because of Bork himself, as he might have refused a new contract if he was pinned.

Reigns and the whole Anoa'i family might have been told after Royal Rumble that he would win, but they changed heart after all the heat he is getting, which makes sense with all the dirtsheet news we are reading

Or, this is just an elaborate April Fool by Meltzer 









 Efficiency. It's not just purely down to the lower revs. A Le Mans engineer once said that any noise is just wasted energy. And with the 100kg fuel limit, engine manufacturers had to make engine as efficient as they can. 




 chicken and egg problem. They need races on the track to get money to upgrade teh fencing

 














 I don't even realise it's April 1 









 Enzo as Fry

eyepatch Carmella as Leela

Big Cass as Bender 




 I thought it's a football chant? 




 650D + 70-200 F4 + 1.4 extender. The lens has no IS, so some pics do look blurry if the panning is too fast 




 weird. Works fine for me

 It is. Genii has a working relationship with Proton to use the Lotus name, hence they will feature the logo whenever they race in Malaysia

 Turn 15. It's free entry and free roam on Friday so you can just go to anywhere and everywhere you want. Sadly I forgot to go to the turn one and only realised I could get good pictures there after i got home 




 celeb inductee and WM is in California and Ahnold is a friend of Bruno 









 You mean Reigns 




 I had it since it was first launched. And the reason was simple. I am not from the USA and for some reason the PPV is never shown in HD here. But it was smooth sailing today. And I was using a VPN, not even a direct connection 




 So we will be seeing another Taker match?  




 Because it's to plug a movie? 




 "Hey Paul, you need to go out to this Terminator theme so we can plug the new Arnold movie"

"No, I ain't doing it"

"We will let you get over Sting..."

"okay hand me the damn helmet" 




 Depends. The Rock has limited in ring abilities but he's a charming guy on the mic and entertaining, hence why even casuals loved him. 

I can see female liking Reigns, but male casuals? Not at his current level of mic ability 




 Triple Action Bed Match between Seth and J J Security? 




 Was smooth.

Ironic part? I'm not even in the country listed to get the Network, and I have to use a VPN. Even I was surprised that it stayed smooth 




 It was to plug in Ahnold's movie. And it's best for Trips to be the sacrificial goat for it rather than anybody else 




 He was just acting 




 I don't doubt Hogan. He's been pushing for another match for a while so he's sure to be fit. But Nash? Man, DDP did wonders 




 FCUK YES THIS IS AWESOME! REIGNS DID NOT WIN AND LESNAR IS NOT CHAMPION! MARKING OUT!
 




 NOTICE ME STING-SEMPAI! 




 Kane and Big Show. This feels like Royal Rumble all over again 




 This is because the HOF ran late, so they put the most illustrious name just after the middle so people could just go to sleep after it and watch Diesel the next day on repeat 




 the fact that Punk uses the dot to make sure everyone sees the original tweet means that it was not really serious in the first place.  




 Fujinami has already been inducted by Woooo! 




 PLENTY OF HOES!

Someone print a T-Shirt of this

 HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE WORM! 




 Please press F for the rest of the night 




 Whoever control that mic should get a pay raise 




 if you are a part of a twin you're highly likely would get a twin offspring as well 




 I was actually expecting to see Brooke with Bully Ray and then I remembered it was just a TNA storyline :/ 




 What's the sound like coins dropping when he downshifts? 









 He was not at ONS. It was all Dreamer and Heyman 




 Sadly El Ray is not an option to other countries, such as Asians 




 At full res, the quality is not what you would call good, say compared to /u/IncredibleThings 




 I just realised that after you mentioned it and went back to see my pics

http://i.imgur.com/sDmRs57.jpg

You're right, can't seem to see it here  




 Friday is always like this tbh due to it still a working day. The front grandstand has quite the crowd by the end of FP1 and start of FP2

 I was wondering why it was Bridgestone when I realised it's not from this year 









 I have always loved WWE's Legend of Wrestling. They usually get the people that in the know and most will yield some sort of interesting story of backstory. And they are willing to talk about other wrestling promotion in the show as well. 









 I use borderlinx to get a USA and UK mailing address. I usualy just use Hola plugin to view the network. Note that sometimes you won't be fast enough on vpn to view live shows on the network on HD, but non live shows are usually fine for me.  




 Nothing new. Basically what Brawn did for the 2009 season where he prepared everything two seasons prior and caught everyone with their pants down 




 You mean 90% of the world?

But thank you

OSW did a review on the rumble. It's more funnier and exciting when listening to the guys explaining each match 




 F 




 scan it, and get a shop to print a larger version. Don't worry if it looks blurred due to enlargement. Since if it goes on TV it will look smaller and sharper 




 During the design Tilke made sure that you can basically see half of the track from wherever you are seating, hence why the hills are abundant around the track to create a theater like natural stands 




 Bottom of the car could have hit the driver's head 




 Triple H for me was the character that suits the situation.

Need a heel for a babyface to get over? Get HHH

Need a babyface for a hell to get over? Get HHH

Need a hell for a B+ player to get over? Get HHH 



















 Mosanto Weed Killer 




 I honestly think if his engine did not develop a problem at Hungary he could have won that race 




 Yes 




 KLCC for obvious reasons (Petronas) 









 Also as long as they (Mercs) are winning or near the top, other teams would want their engines, which in turn would be profitable in the long run as well.
 




 iirc the biggest merchandise movers are the kids that would ask their parents to buy them stuffs.
 Smarks would look at the price, balk and walk away 




 Helps that he's charismatic as hell and I was surprised to know that NXT is his first wrestling stint. He looks so comfortable in the ring and with the crowd 




 She should get Snoop Dog to do her Main Roster song 




 They could make her (him) wear some generic cosplay for weekly and house shows, and get a licensed costume + song for PPVs ala Finn Balor 




 "So this is where the big boys plays huh?" 




 And it does not even have to be a diva. They could make it ala Nagashima Yuichirou.  




 Who was Mr America 




 You're right. Didn't notice that it's still 28nm. Might be they are still struggling to manufacture/fabricate 22nm chips for it to be financially viable for end users 




 The card is heavy and the reference design does not have a backplate. Wait for ASUS or MSI to manufacture one with backplate. Not only it keeps the card from sagging, it dissipate heat better too 




 I don't think you can use a VRAM the same way as you can use your onboard RAM, correct me if I'm wrong tho ^^; 




 Just woke up. Sorry. It's morning in Asia and I had a long day

- Gallery updated with some more pics, but since the NDA has long gone, you guys should have seen pictures/benchmarks floating from other sites already

- 3D Mark score for Firestrike Extreme http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/6261359

- In comparison, a GTX980 running on the same machine http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/5555099

- Card is quite hot. Nvidia should find another design to be honest. Can't wait for an MSI or ASUS version with a proper backplate 









 Sample, hence the NDA 




 DX11.2 / Win8.1 sadly. 




 I don't think Twitch would mind if it's from NVIDIA or AMD since it's mostly about gaming at the end 




 Ironically doing just that. Rendering a 6Mbps VC1 video to two pass 3Mbps H264 while running Assetto Corsa.  




 If you seen or touched the Nvidia engineering sample GTX980, it's basically the same.  




 yes 




 ironically twitch is all twitchy for me. Ustream is smoother 




 6 more hours. ;-)

They are showing the keynote live as well: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/gpu-technology-conference-2015 




 not until the NDA is over sadly. Sorry mate :/ 









 They would let a wrestler do it, if they tell Vince in advance that they are doing it. 

CM Punk did it to Cena without clearance and was reprimanded. I don't see any problem for Bork to do it if he gets the proper clearance 




 Apparently Vince thought when people points to the WM sign it looks weird so they add the play button, implying they are pressing that 




 Also while people (and even WWE) make it sounds like he inherited the business, he bought out the company from his father. 




 Hopefully I won't be a McLaren. At least Virgin fought to be Manor

That aside, not all press conference are shown or aired. For example the one after the British GP where Hamilton got his hand on the real trophy and shown it to the media was not aired. We only knew it after journalist tweeted the picture out 




 Honda CAN give them engines, just not this year, as they have an exclusive deal with McLaren. And looking back at today, Helmut Marko would rather have the Renault than the Honda 




 This is from the media press conference right? They usually never record/show this on TV. Unless FIA releases them on their youtube channel

But yeah, it's highly different from "Massa"

 Random stupid question. Was watching the qualy replay and there was a mention that Manor's old base has been sold to Haas. 

Could two teams share a base? For example, Manor rent some space from their old base/factory from Haas.  




 There should be a list of all the bumps Hebner took in his career

Bernie's not interested in sparks for 2016, hires Michael Bay to put TNT on random cars for each races 




 Ah, that means you will be able to access http://www.racematelive.com/

It's Fox Sports F1 companion site, where they stream onboard, live timing, pit lane camera, etc. Region locked to the country that they are showing F1 tho 




 Asia 




 Because I've been watching it for the last few years? 




 The irony is the BBC needs him as much as he needs the BBC. 

The reason that Top Gear works is that Top Gear buys most the cars (with taxpayer's money mind you) they feature on the show (except for special cars like from Ferrari), hence when the presenters gave some bad reviews, car companies can't retaliate. This is what makes Top Gear special, as they can basically say what they want without repercussion, something other car shows, which the cars are sponsored, can't do 




 Why not just get the old Arrows three seater? Get a paid rich kid in the third seat. That way you can have money AND have an actually good driver driving the car 




 Is the mechanic on top of the roof drunk? :D 









 True. I had a hard time finding Sin Cara's matches in the network 




 IIRC Billy Gunn and Road Dogg are also travelling with the WWE show hence they need someone that is always at the performance centre to be the head trainer 




 *Every time Corey Graves hands over the mic*

"Hey yo!" 




 Hence the NXT special you see happening this week. For a PPV, no.

They have an agreement with FSU, and it's better for the students of FSU to see and learn in FSU itself. Remember, the students are NOT learning how to be a WWE staff, but they are learning how to produce a TV show in general 




 As much as I also wants to see this, it won't happen. The Takeover special is always done at Full-Sail for the students there to learn how WWE makes a live show/PPV.

 I have question dear Mr Bork sir, does Mr Bork prefer fighting with Goat Man, or Steroid Infused Man for the gold shiny thing? 









  Scott speed

Isn't Scott an American? 




 Watching it in a cinema is awesome, especially with the 7.1 audio. 

- animation is as good as it can be, but the CGI sometime looks overdone. I love how the crowd was animated/CGI'ed. They do not look copy pasted, but looks like a crowd of individuals

- I know the manga was kind of funny. But I never expected they would keep it in the movie. Lucifer/Ral adventure was kinda weird to watch, but man it was funny

- After watching this, now I realised why Char/Casval hated Amuro. He was the original angsty, emo kid in a death machine and Amuro stole that gimmick 




 http://i.imgur.com/PbMFBfG.jpg thank god they are showing it on cinema here 









 Didn't they do this for most of their cars? I remember there was an article on the Red Bull in Hungary (I forgot which year) that they arrived expecting it to be hot, but after finding out the temp is not that high, they paneled off the cooling vents 




 because only 6 cars have cameras in them per race?
