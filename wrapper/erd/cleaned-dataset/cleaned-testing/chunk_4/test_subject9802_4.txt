 I guess what got me was the fact that, in order to look powerful, I would have to be a lesbian? Haha 




 Yeah, I don't know either...  
I was wearing tight black dress pants, a black blazer and black heels at work.  




 I've been asked by a coworker (in front of other coworkers) if I spit or swallow... No matter what my response was, it would have been incredibly awkward. I laughed and just walked away and I heard him say "she swallows..."  

At that point, I figured "fuck it" and I walked back and said "yeah, I do. I can't believe you asked me that, but whatever. I'm not ashamed." He was surprised I answered, but I'd rather come off as confident than have them make up their own stories for what I choose to do in my personal life. *shrug* 




 Yesterday, I got two...  

* I like your boobies!
* You look hot! Like a power lesbian or something...

I work in a bar, so I get a lot of weird comments and compliments from drunk people. 




 I find that it's really hard to gauge! Sometimes they're walking *just slow enough* to have it be awkward if I hold it, but have it close in their face if I don't. **Life is so hard!** 




 A Bloody Mary.  
Or, you know, going for a run and sweating it off, despite wanting to commit suicide. 




 Dr. Pepper, man..... That shit is a symphony of flavors!  
I tend to like a lot of the weird drinks. Celery Soda, Moxie, Ginger beer, Birch Beer... 




 Reddit. 
I didn't like the way the layout worked, but once I gave it a fair shot, I was hooked.  
**Edit:** Thanks to whomever gilded this comment! I feel warm and fuzzy inside :3 




 "Enjoy all of the diseases you don't have antibodies for!"  
And with that, I puff into a cloud of smoke and disappear before they kill me for being a witch. 




 I am really good at ignoring/walking away from people who annoy the crap out of me. When I'm sober, I sit there, painfully, and listen to people's incessant dribble all while looking like I'm the most interested person in the world. 




 The perfect formula for predicting the success and quality pun comment threads 




 Always. It gets awkward when they are walking really slowly and I just stand there like a fool waiting for them. Btw, I'm a girl. Politeness goes both ways! :) 




 Cocktail waitress here.... Taking drinks off of my tray when I have a large party. I have it down to a very delicate balance, damn it! 




 .... Jesus. :( 




 Bless your heart! I've been there and it's brutal. Glad to see you having fun with it! 




 I don't really work out, but I should... I really like kettlebells and I ride a bike for commuting purposes, but I mostly just try to watch what I eat, haha...  
If my non-existent baby was a girl I'd name her Wynona Ryder, hahah. Or Lucille II...  
I have a cat named [Hercules](http://i.imgur.com/NnTBvzI.jpg) whom I love very much. I would also looooove to have a pet fox or raccoon, though! 




 -professional fart noises- 




 3D printing is the way of the futuuuuure! I hear that organic matter can also be printed 3D! Wild. 




 Thank you!!!!! :D 




 Haha I'm thankful this is something I now know about 




 Smart move. I can totally relate. You go girl! 




 1: nope! I work at a bar that's underground so no one will wanna go. We are clooooosed :)  
2: only in my bedroom so I've been a hermit lately, haha...  
3: ummm... I've been fond of rye manhattans for a while now. I also really like most gin drinks. Tom Collins are my jam and pimm's cup :) 




 [I like to draw and some people think I'm good at it :)](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com/) 




 Okay! I usually default to animals. Do you have a favorite? 




 I don't think so! But if you want, I can show you my profile...  




 No, I sadly don't have a dishwasher. Melissa has got me one upped on that... I have always wondered if people often try to pee in litter boxes at crowded parties though...  
I looked nothing like an Asian baby and was confused for an Asian teen mom 




 Yes! What would you like? 




 1: George Michael  
2: the phantom contractions  
3: cloth because I hate myself...   




 Well if they could, they would chuck it not very far... Unless they were up chucking wood ;) 




 1: Dark if anything... I'm not a huge fan of sweets, though! I prefer olives :)  
2: I love scrambled eggs with cheddar and hot sauce! Fresh tomato and avocado on the side with lemon juice and salt. Simple and delicious!  
3: None because they're pussies and have no chucking abilities 




 1: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds  
2: Fuck Tom Cruise, Marry Gary Busey, Kill Mel Gibson (obvi)  
3: Hell yeah! I need to get significantly drunk to handle the crazy that entails, though... 




 OH GOD WHAT DID I MISS? 




 I like your shirt! Where did you get it?
Are you gonna tell work you quit or just not show up? That's what I did with my last job :3 









 At least there is video evidence -weeps- 




 hahahah damn it! I'm so happy there is video evidence 




 Holy shit Melissa actually exists?! 




 Yes I'm so happy you got a screencap of this! 




 likewise! :D 




 this is the funniest thing I have ever witnessed 




 Hi I am Shea, the creep that was lurking in your hangout :) 




 Spain is so fun! I happened to be in Valencia at the right time this year and got to participate in Las Fallas. Such fun! I'm a little envious you're there and I'm no longer. It's a beautiful place.

Also, you're a babe. 




 Well excuuuuuuuuse me, princess! 




 I'll post more in the comments as I continue to write this out. I just really need to get this out somewhere... I apologize for my crappy writing skills.  


Its been a long time since Ive openly written about what my life was like growing up.  A part of me has been putting it off because Im not sure how vividly I remember it but despite the amount of time Ive had to move past it, I am still affected by it somewhat regularly.  


First off, a little backstory may help:  
Before I was born, my mother was married to an Israeli man. I have an older brother who was born in 1986. I am not sure how long she had been with my father prior to that, but I was born two years later.
My mother was a model in the eighties. Nothing noteworthy, but from what I gather, she did well for herself. She was a beautiful woman and met my father through a friend of hers. My father was a wealthy businessman who owned a limousine service and invested in a few local restaurants. My father had property in NY and MA; possibly more, but I am not certain.  
In 1988, my father was arrested for drug charges that pointed to him as the leader of a Brookline cocaine ring. Based on the legal documents I could find, he had been responsible for trafficking somewhere in the realm of 350 kilos of cocaine from 1986 to 1988 and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.  


Growing up, I didnt know my father. I knew of him through idle mention, but my mother had already settled down with a new man during my infancy. As far as I was concerned, my stepfather David was whom I called daddy. Growing up, I remember him as a very good father- he was goofy, loving, supportive, etc. He was the co-owner of a motel in Old Orchard Beach, Maine where we would spend the majority of our summers. My childhood seemed pretty great in a general sense- I was provided food, shelter, and often, love. From an early age, however, my parents fought a lot. I used to be a pretty happy and outgoing toddler, but there was often fighting in the home that my brother and I would bear witness to.  
I suppose I should preface that mother is bipolar. Being the youngest and most sensitive child, I was often subjected to psychological, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my mother. Children are inherently needy; they rely on their parents to be a support system during their upbringing and, while I was provided with a lot of love and great experiences growing up, there was an insidious darkness in our home that grew steadily over time.  


To summarize what life was like growing up, here are a few memories I have, both good and bad, in as close to chronological order as my memory will allow.  

* 	My mother used to sing songs to me while running her nails through my hair as I fell asleep. I often asked her to sing me sad songs because from an early age, I was all too familiar with crying myself to sleep (and the deep comfort it brought)


*	My mother threw wonderful, extravagant Christmas parties for her friends that were always such a joy to participate in. The preparation it took prior, however, weighed on her and she often took it out on my brother and me. One vivid memory I have was of her slapping me and shoving my face into a cookie wrapper I left on my bedroom floor; she shamed me like an owner shames their dog for having an accident.


*	If I wasnt polite or if I spoke out of line, I would be smacked on the mouth and shamed into submission. My aunt recalls a time that she took me into the city during one of her visits; she said that I waited for her at the door with my little suitcase packed and refused to leave the doorway. She bought me a stuffed Pumba doll from the Disney store and when I came home, I insisted that it was okay that I had it because it was on sale and that I wasnt a burden and/or hadnt coaxed my aunt into buying me frivolous things.


* 	One time, my mother stabbed my stepdad with a steak knife. My brother, stepdad and I spent the night in a motel and he called us out of school the next day. I dont remember much, but I remember sitting in silence in his car in the rain while he thought about what to do. We returned home the next day.


*	In middle school, I remember my mother beating me and mocking/shaming me particularly bad. I was already picked on pretty bad in school and didnt want to show up puffy faced and disheveled, so I skipped school and instead hid in our family van. Since I didnt have a watch, I returned home at what I thought was an appropriate time, only to be berated further.


*	Some nights, when I couldnt sleep, my mother and I used to dance to Roy Orbison records in our pajamas until I was tired. 


*	During thunder storms, my mother allowed my brother and me to draw on all of the mirrors and windows with washable markers.


* 	My mom was amazing at sewing and often created our Halloween costumes, wedding clothes, holiday garb, etc. from scratch. The house was always decorated beautifully for holidays, and my mother made the most creative Easter baskets, threw the most fun Easter egg hunts, etc. 


	When my mother was a good mom, she was the best. When she was bad mom, she really made life a living hell. My stepdad is the kind of man that secretly needs a woman to bully or control him. I spent my whole childhood believing that it was normal for my dad to sleep on the couch downstairs. He did his best to protect me when he was home and I always idolized him as my protector and my best friend. Despite his aloof urgings, I was still subjected to consistent, sporadic shaming, beatings, mockery and threats. My own mother would get drunk nightly and call me a cunt; I was told that I was a loser, unwanted, a drama queen, etc. on a too-regular basis. The mother I loved was the living embodiment of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. For fourteen years, I familiarized my beautiful mother as the volatile monster, dormant only when she was left alone to sit in the pantry and chain smoke cigarettes and binge on Coors Light. 


	After fourteen years and countless character and body shaming, physical and psychological beatings, and having to carry my mother to bed drunk, my mother kicked my stepdad out. Loud fights, name-calling and character bashing were a nightly occurrence and my stepdad just endured the abuse like a prisoner afflicted with Stockholm syndrome. It was less than a week later that I followed; I had confessed to my therapist that my mother had beaten me pretty badly on our staircase (the first confession I outwardly made to my therapist, or anyone else, in fourteen years). I was sick of being treated like garbage, and since my stepfather was gone, the abuse only got worse. I remember so vividly the moment my therapist, Gerarda, asked me if I was certain that I wanted to make such a claim, because it would change my life forever. I told her I was, but I had no idea how much my life would change from there.

 I can't get killed because there already is a main character named Shae in the books/show. :(

Granted, my name is Shea, but it's pronounced the same. 




 How is this not getting more attention?! Damn fine. 




 [A school consists of all male, smaller fish and one female, larger fish. When she dies, the largest of the males changes gender to become the dominant fish within the school](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/08/clownfish-are-all-born-male-a-dominant-male-will-turn-female-when-the-current-female-of-the-group-dies/)

I tried to tell a guy who was wearing a shirt with a clownfish on it at a bar that it was a great way to pickup ladies... All you have to do is correlate it to the equivalent of "chicks are the better, dominant gender in some species" or some stupid shit...

ps: I am a female. I am also an ass at bars, though.
