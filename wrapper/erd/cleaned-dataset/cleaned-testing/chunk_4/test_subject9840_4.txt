 Any suggestions?   




 How old is everyone in this thread? You think now is bad? There was a time things were much much worse with our rail system... it's actually pretty good now in comparison.  




 Also I heard someone say once that the employees who are happiest are the ones who know they are learning skills and could get another job... and so they are less likely to leave their current job.  




 What did you do before and what do you do now? I have also been considering a career change. 




 They're making some interesting Big Macs. 




 My bus is always packed and it would be completely unreasonable to expect someone to get off at a particular door. You always go to the one that is closest. 

There are no real rules on buses except I think most people try to be nice to each other. It's bad enough we have to cram into a tube with 50-70 other people. We are all probably not that happy about it.  

Really the worst thing for me is when someone really stinks badly and there is nowhere else for me to move to. It's probably the only thing that will make me get off a bus and wait for the next one.  




 Yeah I've also noticed there are a lot of devs that have done a masters degree here and got a job after that.  




 Try applydirect.com.au too - I no longer apply to recruiters. For me it is a waste of time.  




 Our company is in a niche area and we hire heaps of people from overseas. Actually as an Australian I am in the minority here. If you're not in a niche then I agree it is probably difficult. A lot of people I know from the UK have already been employed by companies like pwc and then it was an internal transfer within their company to Australia. 




 One interview I went to the guy asked for my current pay and then said "oh, I thought it would be less than that" and I was on like $12 an hour. 




 Ah. Maybe my great aunt was just really weird then lol 




 If it helps, my mum's aunt was very traditional British and wanted my mum to return to England to marry her cousin. My great aunt didn't understand why that was wrong either. But at the end of the day my mum made her own decision (not incest obviously!). 

It must be frustrating but I suppose the best you can do is talk to your parents and ask them not to stereotype and  guide your daughter to help her make her own mind up about what she likes or doesn't like. 




 Me and my sister played with mud and foil tins. No we weren't poor. We just liked it. :) I feel as though kids toys are overly complicated these days. Maybe it's good to have a mix. 




 I can understand why grandparents might do that though. They grew up in a very different world. Not saying they should just that they don't see how it's insane. 




 Mine were like that too. I had each side done while awake. The first side went very well. Second side I got dry socket. Has to be among the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I drugged myself up and tried to sleep through it for a few days. 




 Did they have to shoot it? Would it be possible to just cut its horns? 




 I loooove their cakes. My favourite is the blackforest cake. David Jones at Elizabeth St also has a really good one!  




 What is your favorite way to pay tax? 




 If you need to take something with you like lunch and it's stored in the fridge, put your keys on top of it and you won't forget to take it.  




 Set aside some time by yourself with nothing planned. You can just do whatever you feel like doing at the time and live life in the present. Making plans sometimes means doing stuff you don't feel like doing just because you planned it.  




 Stretch when you first wake up in the morning. I don't mean just wave your arms about and yawn, I mean really try to stretch all the major muscles. You will feel a lot better the rest of the day. 




 Before you leave work each day write a list of things you need to do the next day. This lets you leave work at work and stop wasting time when you get to work in the morning. 




 A beautiful scenic shot taken on one of my trips with my loved ones in it. The scenery because I would miss the vast open spaces and it would remind me of a trip that I enjoyed and give me hope for more. And loved ones because it would remind me I have people worth living for and it would remind me that I'm a person who other people care about.  




 I think our service is a bit shitty though generally unless it's a top class restaurant. Even then sometimes it's hit and miss. Although I prefer not having to pay tips I think having to earn it would mean service would be better. 




 You should have the nicest stuff first. It tastes even nicer when you're properly hungry. 




 Hehe I hadn't seen this. This was great. :) 




 My mum told me when I was younger flossing was bad for your gums and I believed her. I just had $4000 worth of dental work with another $6000 needed. Floss dammit!! 




 That is a stupid rule anyway. If I care about someone I will tell them things they might not find nice but need to hear. Timing is important. It's like someone got the timing wrong once, then this rule was made up. 




 It's great you two are motivating each other. My partner and I are doing the same... though we're not ready for obstacle courses yet. And you and your partner look great. The hard work has really paid off :) 




 I feel like this too. We really had the best of both worlds. I was always on the computer but when I wasn't I was out with friends or riding my bike or at the beach. 




 I used to like going to the library and using paper, pens and books. There was a study area when I went to uni in the early 2000s which just consisted of desks with space for your books. They replaced it and now there are just computers everywhere. I used to like that the library was a place to kind of focus without the distractions that you have on a computer or laptop. 




 Tell that to the humans. 




 I'll be honest, and I am ashamed of it now - I was initially not a fan of the cycling lanes in Sydney's CBD. When they were first being built people weren't using them and I felt they didn't really go anywhere. While some of that was true in construction, it was incredibly ignorant and short-sighted. There has been such a great acceptance and uptake of those bike lanes, I wonder how I could have ever had that opinion now. 

I questioned why I felt this way and I decided to give cycling in the city a go (albeit on a weekend because I am scared of being run down by crazy cars). It was great. I don't enjoy riding on the roads but with the cycling lanes it feels a lot safer and I really could enjoy it a lot. I even started riding to work. 

I think people don't like cyclists mostly because they haven't done it, and they are ignorant and selfish. I'll admit that is exactly what I was at the time, and it was wrong. 

I have seen both bad cyclists and bad drivers, but I feel that the attitudes in Sydney at least towards the bike paths and cyclists are slowly changing. I think with more good bike paths that will help as more people start trying them out and taking it up. 

There is one thing I still have a gripe with and that is those lay-down bikes with the little flag (I think they're called Recumbent Bikes). I saw a guy nearly get run over by a truck riding one of those down through the city centre on the non-bike lanes. They're impossible for cars to see, and he's almost asking for whatever fate happens to him.   




 Wash your feet in warm water. I always feel better all over if my feet feel nice and clean. 




 I saw this on the plane and there weren't any subtitles. :(

 Where does milk come from?

He was 19. I thought he was joking and then he explained seriously he thought it was made in a factory. 

We thought we'd better not tell him where eggs come from. 




 There are ways to get cheaper tickets tho. You can get $10 Hoyts tickets through Optus. And I think Telstra does Greater Union tickets for about the same.  




 I was just there! Here's the same spot from my car:

I left North Sydney at 5:30. Decided to park and have a break and pull over at 7:30. Still not home...

I picked a bad day to drive to work! 




 That makes sense but then I was thinking about 2 core processors or 6 core. They're not square either. I think you're onto something though. It could be about how common circuitry can be shared between cores. 

I was thinking the base is square so the fan can sit on top neatly. And fans have to be round. 




 Could it be related to the temperature? It is one of the less obvious reasons for sleeping issues. [Source]( http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment). 




 My guess is that it's the way information is stored and processed. 

Binary encoding for data representation is made of bits. A bit is an on/off state which can be used to perform calculations. If you use a larger number of bits for example you can start representing numbers. For example 0101 in binary is 0x2^(3) + 1x2^(2) + 0x2^(1) + 1x2^(0) which gives you the number 5. 

Most of the time processors are built for even number 8, 16, 32, 64 bit length calculations. I think this is because the length of a byte is 8. Why is it 8 bits? It was just what was popular at the time.

Source: [here]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)

So my guess is that it grew from those origins and they stuck with the even number theme. 




 Two main reasons:
1. High Sugar 
2. High Caffeine and/or Other Stimulants


When you eat sugar, your body tries to regulate itself. It does this by causing the pancreas (an organ in your body that makes digestive enzymes to break down your food) to produce a hormone called insulin which helps your body absorb the sugar and turn it into energy or else store it for later use. When you have a lot of sugar, the pancreas tries to produce more insulin to cope. But doing this often can damage the pancreas and over time it can no longer function properly and can't produce enough insulin. Poor insulin creation or absorbtion is a condition called diabetes. If left untreated, all this extra sugar floating around in your blood causes your blood vessels to harden and this can lead to a bunch of nasty conditions like kidney failure, heart attacks, blindness, nerve damage, etc. 

Source: [here](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes?page=2)
and for more information on the 2 types of diabetes see [here](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/diabetes-insulin.html)


Sugar is also terrible for your teeth, and its presence causes the acidity in your mouth to increase as you break down the sugar. When the acidity level in your mouth increases, it eats away at the enamel of your teeth, causing tooth decay. 

Source: [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/the-mouths-guard.html?_r=0)


Not to mention if you are having a lot of sugar all the time you are likely to be eating more than your daily required intake of Calories/kilojoules and become overweight, which can lead to a number of other health issues. 


Caffeine can actually be good in small doses, as it stimulates your central nervous system and causes your heart rate to increase. It is also a diuretic (makes you need to go to the bathroom). A high heart rate can be useful when you need increased mental alertness but it can be bad if you are trying to sleep. It can also have other side effects such as headaches and vomiting if in really high doses. Large amounts of caffeine can also reduce calcium absorbtion and can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis (thin bones). 

If caffeine is not present they use other stimulants like guarana to have the same effect. 

Also when these stimulants are combined with alcohol they can mask how drunk you are, so you are likely to drink more than you might otherwise.

 Maybe it depends on what you're doing at those times. The hormone Melatonin is released at night causing you to feel sleepy, but it is affected by the amount of light. Maybe if you are in front of a light source, it is disrupting what you body expects to be its daily pattern or circadian rhythm.  




 Here is another one - I tried using lightroom also on the modified photo to add in some vignetting so the edges are darker: http://imgur.com/BdY29kZ 




 It's tough because there is so much noise in the photo I blurred it out a bit to make it less noticeable. I have tried sharpening it again but it just adds the graininess back in and it didn't look so great. See here: http://imgur.com/5c1dO9w

I just tried increasing the contrast - this might be a little bit better - it doesn't look as blurry: http://imgur.com/jrQ0XNQ

Maybe someone else on reddit can help? 




 How do you get rid of the bumps like that? I have a couple of photos of my own that I want to do that for. 




 How's this? http://imgur.com/9OMpZki 




 Are the grey clouds meant to be there or was there a spill on the photo? 




 I think that is the same here in Australia. I love Pepsi Max but I can't drink it because it makes me need to pee really badly. No other cola does that to me. I chose it at first because it was cheaper than Coke but now I'm onto caffeine free Pepsi Light. 




 Yeah it's probably a last resort option though. Turia Pitt was competing in a Marathon and she was trapped by a grass fire so she ran back through the flames. She survived though.

 I found this article kind of interesting -does any of this resonate with you?

 Your minimum wage is $7.25? Is that federal? Ours is a little higher but then our cost of living is pretty high too, especially in Sydney. 
http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/Pages/default.aspx 




 I'm not sure if it's directly related, but we often don't have the best service in Australia though. I read somewhere that it's due to changes in formal waitstaff training offerings, but having tips as an incentive must help too. 




 I wanted to save it. I mean that thing has got to be like 1000 years old. But when it started charging at us we had to put it down. :( I am sad but relieved at the same time. 


Edit: I'm sorry for the nightmares! They're actually pretty cool spiders (they kill other pesky insects), and they aren't that poisonous but I just don't like them in my bedroom anymore.

Last time I had one almost as big as this in my bedroom I let him be for 3 days. He didn't move at all so I thought it was fine. But on day 4 I came in the door and he actually charged towards me. I don't think he wanted to be friends anymore... 




 He was sitting right above my bed - actually had to get up on the bed to get him. As soon as we went in the door with the container to trap him he reared up ready for attack. I thought he might run and hide behind the picture, but as we got closer he climbed up onto the tiger picture with both front legs up ready for a fight. By the way, for reference the picture is 32cm (12.5") wide. So he must have been about 8-10cm wide including legs. One of the biggest huntsman I've ever seen.  









 [This guy](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/askville/4725073_55886428_mywrite/2100734030047620693wapafafs.jpg) 




 I try not to worry about what everyone else is doing. As long as you are doing what you want to do, and if you want these other things, then as long as you are making an effort to go get them, then hopefully things will fall into place when the time is right for you. 




 I had a collie rough growing up and I swear he understood every word when I would talk to him about all my troubles. He would come right up and nudge me and I'd hug him, and I would never feel alone as long as he was there.  




 Cool. I found it in the SAS Survival Guide (little pocket book which is great to carry around): http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295358.SAS_Survival_Guide 




 According to my survival book, you can obtain it from some plants such as the roots of hickory trees in North America or of the nipa palm in southeastern Asia. Boil the roots until all the water evaporates and black salt crystals are left.

If no direct salt sources are available then you can get it second hand through animal blood. 




 The Cronulla riots happened over 7 years ago now. I wish we could all move on from it.  




 How did you go with this? Is it still leaking? 




 It's bizarre isn't it? I know of plenty of organisations and people that still use faxes and it pretty much always surprises me.  




 We have had a lot of these in my mum's backyard lately. They have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding (I keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders I find). I kill them when I see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices. I always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies. Still, they make me feel uncomfortable.

I actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because I know they're pretty harmless but one day I walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me. That was the end of our relationship. 




 I just use white vinegar and it works really well, it's cheap and safe for the environment. Also it doesn't scrape off any layers of paint that I am aware of. 




 TIL about lava soap. We have something similar - orange scrub: http://www.septone.com.au/detail.asp?item_cat= item_number=31 page_num=2 
Smells like oranges too. 




 Well, the best water level is water. :) Gotta make sure those hedges are trimmed to perfection! When the water level goes down, it's the first thing people will notice. 




 Good thing they had their headlights on or they wouldn't have been able to see where they were going!! 




 Floodpants or a dinghy... 




 Someone needs to make a book of best-of reddit posts for deperate redditors for when there are internet outages. I'd do it but I'm busy reading reddit at the moment.  




 There's been more information on the Townsville Bulletin website and some updates are [here](http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2013/01/28/374359_news.html). The emergency services numbers have been on ABC 24 all day, but without details of where/why etc.  




 I went to a restaurant (Mad Pizza yum) yesterday and we ordered wood fired pizzas and pasta. The air con in that place wasn't working too well. We sat in there wiping off our sweat with napkins. I kept looking in the kitchen. Really felt bad for that poor guy in there with the pizza oven. But the food was good :) 




 It was in the Shire not Western Sydney and it was a long time ago. Probably in the 90's. Maybe 20 years ago now. 

There are really only two hot years I remember out of probably many - the one when my goldfish died, and the one when a whole lot of my neighbours lost their houses and were sitting in our street with their cars full of whatever they could grab as they had to abandon their homes.

Anyway - Sucks to be in Western Sydney right now!!  




 I was only a little kid and it was almost an extra room of the house with walls on 3 sides, and normally when it's not that hot the fish is fine... just not on that day. I realised about half way through the day and went to get him to bring him inside but it was too late :(  




 I wonder if jogging on a day like today would even begin to give you an idea of how hot a firefighter gets when they're fighting a bushfire. 

I mean there are firefighters out there right now - so I suppose it must feel a thousand times hotter in their suits, with the heat from an actual fire on top of the heat that is hotter than the city. Not to mention more life threatening. They deserve a lot of respect. 

* Edit - wanted to include a pic of firefighters fighting fires in Western Sydney (Penrith) today:

 No but it stopped! But soon there will be thunder and lightning and more rain... If you trust bom. 




 The hottest day I remember in Sydney before this was 44C. There might have been hotter days before or after that but I remember because it was the day I forgot about my goldfish outside on the patio and the water boiled. Rip fishy. :-(  




 I had so many people tell me that and now ten years on, I can tell you that at least for me high school was the worst years of my life and I am so damn grateful those years are over. If you're in highschool don't believe it. It might be true for some people, but it's not a blanket rule. My life is so much better now. 









 Thanks. I've done a little bit more. I don't know how much more time I would be willing to spend on it as there is a lot of work involved but perhaps someone else would like to give it a go. Here's the results of what I've done:

I can't really fix the boy's face as it would require redrawing it as there is so much missing, so I've left the tear over it. Maybe with another picture someone can help you out.

I'm also kind of new at this so I don't really know how to get rid of the green without losing too much photo quality. I did my best.

Good luck! 




 I did a bit of work on their faces but I need to go to sleep now: http://imgur.com/CIfkd
I'll see what I can do tomorrow.

Btw, the boy second from the left is going to be a little bit difficult to reconstruct because of how much of his face is missing. Do you have any other photos of him? 




 Do you have a higher resolution scan? That would be really helpful. There is quite a lot of damage to the photo. 




 haha this one made me laugh. :) 




 No problem :) Glad I could help!  




 http://i.imgur.com/gSxGv.jpg - I think this came out pretty well.

For those who are doing something on it still, this was my first attempt: http://i.imgur.com/xkY9N.jpg
I tried to reduce the white flare on the left a bit so the photo is more even. 
Then it wasn't quite even on the right, so I've used j00jy's version and created a multiply layer to even out the flare on both sides and got the above.

By the way, I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin :(  









 Yeah I like the Australian Reptile Park better cause it's less crowded and some of the animals like kangaroos and emus roam freely, and they have nicer enclosures than both the zoo and the city one, but the downside is that it's also far if you're a tourist. I really like the Galapagos tortoise, the croc enclosure and the Tassie devils there. I guess koala park or featherdale could be another option, but not sure as I haven't been there since I was a little kid. Taronga zoo is ok for Australian animals too. The koala enclosure is good as you can walk up and view them from a high platform, and they have a few small crocs. I don't remember anything about being able to hold them though. Apparently [govt regulations don't allow it anymore](http://taronga.org.au/animalencounter) . They do have a walk around section now you mention it which was pretty good. 
 




 I agree with everything you said! My ring is not 3 months salary but is so amazing. He designed it and picked the stones himself at a family jeweller. To me it is perfect. I have the most beautiful engagement ring. I've since seen ones with bigger price tags and would never trade. You know what really makes it extra beautiful is not the ring itself but what it represents and more importantly who it comes with :) That's what I think of whenever I see it... not the price tag.  




 - Taronga Zoo
- Sydney Harbour/The Rocks
- You should probably go to at least one beach (Bondi is the most touristy, Manly is where all the expats live, Coogee is another city beach option). Manly has an arts   crafts market on Sunday (http://www.ourmanly.com.au/Travel/manly-markets.aspx).
- Sydney is known for markets, depending on how much you like markets there are just so many... [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markets_in_Sydney) is not a bad list but the best for tourists (near the city) are probably Paddy's Markets near Central Station, The Rocks market, Manly Arts   Crafts and Paddington Markets. Don't get all market-ed out though. They are not all places to get a bargain - some, like the Rocks and Paddington Markets can be expensive.
- Harbour Bridge climb is an option (costs $$ but I hear it's good), or if you prefer you can just walk across it for free.
- Visit some kind of national park and go walking - There are some good ones around the city, but if you want the real bush then you need to go to a bigger one and you need a car to get there - for example The Royal National Park or Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. If you're really keen then you could also go to the Blue Mountains. There's some WW2 gunner stations at Mosman which are interesting to walk around, and have a great view. Again though, not easy to get to without a car.
- Go to some sort of wildlife park - especially if you're not from Australia. One that is easy to get to is the Reptile Park in the city next to Sydney Aquarium. They have crocs and other Australian animals there.
- While you're there you may as well go to the acquarium. It's not bad, they have penguins and stuff.
- You could do a harbour lunch cruise - try get a deal (like on ouffer or something) and it should cost you about $50 for lunch on a cruise boat.

There's probably more things I could suggest, but that's all I have off the top off my head right now. 




 I agree with the others about the salary being decent.

Off topic slightly, but related to income... Check out this page about LAFHA (Living Away From Home Allowance) - it could be useful:
http://www.lafha.com.au/Employees.aspx

There's been some changes in this year's budget in relation to it, due to people abusing the system, but I think (depending on the sort of visa you get) you can still get it. I know most people at my company have LAFHA payments, as we have a lot of staff coming from overseas due to our skills shortage. Check out the bottom of that page for more details. There's probably some more stuff on expat forums as well you could search for. 




 My cat had pretty long fur and had really bad fleas once and was running around biting random objects and jumping around like she was on fire. I had to give her a bath to get rid of some fleas and then we put her on flea medicine after that. Probably should have done that in the first place.   




 Why does the girl look so disgusted at the kitten?
