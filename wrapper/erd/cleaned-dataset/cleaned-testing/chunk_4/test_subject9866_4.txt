 Just look up "Chance The Rapper [song] Remix" and look through the results. You're bound to find something
 




 Ah, I see. Well that's cool. I personally think it would have been better w/ no drop and just like a really nice remix and warp of the vocals and all that jazz. 




 Did you find this off the A Capella remix someone posted? 




 OG just means it has "Nike Air" on the toungue.

I have no idea if they're legit or not, but that's what that means. 




 You obtained these for fucking $13. 

Wat.

 Thank you for making me laugh like a dying seal in the middle of my Math class. 




 Ah, I see. 




 Holy fucking shit XD

Do U.S. based products generally take that long to get to you? 




 Alrightie yeah, thismakes a bit of sense. Thanks for the info 




 I've seen Gel Lyte IIIs and Gel Lyte Vs, but are IVs a thing? If so, could you link a picture? 




 Is it really? I downloaded it and the title is "Long Time 2" 




 No, I mean the two different songs off #10Day. 




 I personally like the latter (Long Time II) a bit more. 




 I personally don't like the KD 7 Elites. They just look really odd to me. But, good for you man! Wear what you like 




 I'm with [Tuesday] (http://www.reddit.com/user/Tuesday), I think the Sock Darts are ugly, don't really understand the hype.

Then again, everyone has their own style, so like what you like. 




 I'm not too big a fan of the Ventilators. But, I can definitely see the appeal in them.
