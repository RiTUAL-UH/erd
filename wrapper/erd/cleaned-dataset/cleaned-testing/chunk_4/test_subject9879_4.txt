 The Frankfurt School of Finance and the UN Energy Program collaborate together as [FS-UNEP](http://fs-unep-centre.org/). It could be the resource for you. 




 An *unchecked* desire for profit is evil. Let's say you, hypothetically have a ton of nuclear fissile material. Rather than turning it in to the GOI - you want to have an open auction on it where everyone from Iran to ISIS is invited - and you will sell it to the highest bidder. Why should you be arrested? After all, as per you, you just wanted to profit, and a desire for profit is not evil. 




 Mail your program coordinator - they often send out mails to current grad students to match them up. And yes, try Craigslist but take the listings with a grain of salt.
Also, try calling up [The Apartment Store](http://www.apartmentstore.com/) or the [Vairo Village](http://locations.rentberger.com/vairovillage/). Many grad students live in apartments owned by either of these two companies, and they may be able o help you out. 




 Yeah, that same woman who destroyed HP. Even though I partially blame HP for hiring her in the first place - considering how it was open knowledge that Fiorina bombed out Bell Labs, setting American science back by decades. 




 Its a good article - but you can take Akamai as one another example of university research translating to a company. 




 I suspect timelines. Tangential to the point /u/Vertov_throwaway makes - PhD research is often more fundamental which translate to the market much further down the line, rather than an immediate breakthrough. Also corrollary: how many CS companies are actually based on novel breakthroughs? In fact most of them are succesful because they have the most polished interpretation of an already established idea. 




 How about a progressive tax - increase the rate with alcohol content? But as a liberal Indian living in the States, I have drunk more than my fair share - I am still not a hundred percent sure about loosening alcohol laws. I have seen enough shit on St. Patrick's day to change my mind on alcohol. 




 Calibri is a terrible, terrible font. At least use Palatino.  




 Try the [Boston University's LEAP program](http://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/special-programs/leap/). It gives you a Masters Degree in Biomedical, Computer Systems, Electrical, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical, Photonics, Manufacturing or Systems Engineering in three years. The program is specifically tailored for students who did their undergrad in liberal arts - so it may suit you really well.

I know several students who thrived in this program, and even went on towards PhDs in engineering at either BU or even other really prestigious STEM schools. 




 I am a bit surprised that ARL was not the target, given its much more sensitive work. 




 From personal experience - stay with an apartment company rather than an individual landlord. And also, may people sublet their apartments for the summer, or for a semester. Subletting is cheap, and you will have the time to search for a good place, if you don't mind moving again.  




 Also, interestingly apart from Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota education budgets have been slashed per capita across the nation. 

And honestly, while I knew that Louisiana was bad, I did not know that Arizona was worse. 




 A PhD, even though comes under the purview of education, with all its associated paperwork and degree - is for all purposes an apprenticeship.

It is a relic of an earlier era, one to which graduates of the modern education system often find difficulty adjusting. The modern educational system is defined by structure and standardization - while a PhD is exactly the opposite. In fact if I have to take a guess, increasing standardization across curricula will soon trickle up to the doctorate level too.

I am not raining on the OP at all, in fact academia is filled to the brim with assholes (any department which has more than 15 faculty at least has one). But I am rather commenting on how different the PhD experience is for different people - precisely because it is a multi-year apprenticeship masquerading as a degree. 









 My adviser absolutely *loves* meetings. Which translates into something like 9 hours a week in the summer. I have tried telling that meeting so much is not very productive, as I cannot get results every alternate day - but I have not been able to convince her.

Fellow subredditors, what is the optimum meeting time per week according to you? And how do you try to achieve that?
