 transtrenders can be of any kind, not specifically of non-binaries (nor that I'm saying nonbinaries are necessarily transtrenders)

there is no policing or invalidation if the case study is what it is 




 that was part/conclusion of the study. I'm not hiding facts here, she said that being a man while still a woman was hurting her.

and I'm sorry that happened to you. There's no such things as not being dysphoric enough. Just either you are or you are not. 




 are they women that are fine with being men and thus are defined as men?

because Norah still feels/felt like a woman while being disguised as a man. That's why it was hard for her. 




 okay fair enough, I do believe in androgynous and agender (although they do fit into the definition of binary) but all other non-binaries claim a 'third gender' which is what I was referring more to 














 you are just assuming homosexuality is moral, which is what this argument is trying to prove/disprove. you have circular reasoning. 




 regardless of my stance on homosexuality and I am not trying to prove/go against it, I just want to get rid of this fallacious argument.

what I mean is that people say homosexuality is found in many species, okay so what?
on the other hand people go against nature to justify gender issues??

cannibalism or eating their young ones, rape, destroying another one's genitals, fight to death, leaving disabled ones to die out, and other behavior is found in other species, does that make it okay?
(I know things like cannibalism is still practiced in certain cultures but the idea is we still view it as 'wrong') 




 sona can get too boring to play really fast (not to mention the multiple nerfs, like 30) for such a huge investment; not amount of fancy particles is going to make it more enjoyable (unless they just overhaul her kit I'm talking about in-game effects, for example remove cc with her heal and what not).

also, in my opinion: might as well not give the discount since the discount is fairly meaningless.

Ezreal doesn't get boring fast (although may the skin might since all skills are blue but w/e). and Udyr certainly has dynamics.
