 When I washed dishes for a living the head chef suggested the "pissing cow" technique. Stand with your legs as far apart as possible and you'll be a lot lower. 




 Number 14 just shrunk somebodies laundry. 




 Give the Celexa another week or so, these types of drug need to build up in your system for a while before they take effect. 

Have you explored any non-medical treatments yet? There's so much out there for you to try and everyone has something that will work for them. Don't give up hope, we're all here with you! 




 That document is brilliant, thanks for sharing! 

I actually went for the grab-bag idea in the end. I got the previous speaker to choose the next speaker's item, so that there was always a bit of time for everyone to think about the question. All-in-all I think it went down really well and I got lots of positive comments afterwards! 




 Looks like a used dog toy! 




 Similar problem with my wifi in the past, the password was "cuntbubbles".

I have no idea how it came into existence, I blame my flatmates. 




 This was fascinating, thanks for sharing! 




 Thank you so much, this is really useful! 




 Hi everyone,

Tonight I am going to be Table Topics master for my local toastmasters meeting. I have come up with a seasonal theme for this and am feeling well prepared on that front, however I am unsure how to introduce table topics to the group, particularly if there are any new members.

Does anybody have any advice or key topics I should address when introducing this portion of the meeting? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am still awaiting my Leadership manual - it is being shipped to the UK so is taking a long time to arrive.

Thanks in advance! 




 Glad to see this at the top, the very fact that the quote starts with the word "but" is a red flag.  




 Thank God you're here, to the top with you!  




 I always jerk off when I'm tired, helps me sleep. 




 I don't think anyone in the thread has said it was intentional, at least I don't think anyone was being serious.

I hope... 




 At my local club we do the CRC method - commendation, recommendation, commendation. Gives the speaker an area to improve in but sandwiches it between praise so they're motivated to do it again. 




 Last night our topics master had some pretty good ones that she actually used with her Primary School class at the start of year for ice-breaking. 

The questions we had were "If you could have any super power, what would it be?", "If you could speak another language, which would you choose and why?", "If you won the lottery, what would you spend it on?" and "Who (living or dead) would be at your dream dinner party?".

They were really fun topics to discuss and quite suitable for beginners too as they're all quite light-hearted. 




 Hey Alison_Hendrix,

I'm in a very similar position at the moment, just started a Masters degree and it scared the shit out of my when I first got here. I also used to be an overachiever and have found it a bit of a shock how much harder I have to work here!

Turning 22 is a scary age, I couldn't agree more. Everyone says your life will start to fall into place at this age but I can vouch for it not being that simple. You do have to work hard for what you want to achieve, but you CAN do it.

Take a step back from your situation at this very moment and try to stay calm. You're probably using these past couple of months to define who you are at this point in your life, and convincing yourself that you're a person who panics and can't get things done. Try to think of your life in the context of who you were before that as well. You've achieved so much already and with just a little bit of hard work you can achieve everything that you want.

Don't get too hung up on the past, focus on what you need to do in this very moment to succeed. 

Oh, and try meditation!
