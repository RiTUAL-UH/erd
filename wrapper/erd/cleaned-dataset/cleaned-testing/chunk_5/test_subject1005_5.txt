 Kevin Bacon will be joining and Victoria will be helping out today! 




 I think I know.  




 It's a terrible premise combined with terrible characters with a mix of terrible dialogue.  




 I can't believe that movie got made. Seriously.  




 I know this movie wasn't received very warmly, but I find it strange that even Coen bros fans don't place this one too high. It is in the same vein as The Big Lebowski in that it is a big much ado about nothing and characters with very familiar and strange quirks. What does R/movies think? 




 Too many. I wish kids would stick to FB and leave Reddit alone.  




 That's not the point the writer was making. But thank you for telling us something we already know.  




 "You still don't get it, do you?" 




 I seem to always get downvoted when saying ANYTHING remotely critical of this movie, but there just isn't anything special or unique about it. I agree, it's a great movie and there's nothing fundamentally I would change about it, but I feel like people (younger people in particular) see this as their Stand By Me. It is a very good movie, but really isn't something we haven't seen before. Go ahead. Downvote me.  




 I agree. It wasn't a bad movie at all, but there was nothing unique about it.  




 Another "mind blowing" fact that gets brought up is John Cazale.  




 I know folks hated it, but I loved the circlejerk r/movies did on April 1 with Leo and his hand. Def illustrates my point.  




 Any post where Starship Troopers in mentioned, a long line of posts pop-up saying "you know its satire, right?" as if they are blowing minds. What're yours?  




 The first and second Left Behind weren't bad at all (insanely better and closer to material than Nick Cage's) and Like Father, Like Son is still hilarious.  




 Alan Rickman doing his "Bill Clay" in Die Hard still throws me off. I literally have NO IDEA where the difference in his accent is supposed to be. "Ahhhh! Ahh!! You're one of them!" I'm like...we know its you, Hans.  




 Which dead trio would you like to see come back and make a movie? And what would it be about? 




 Trace Buster Buster! 




 I liked this one a lot. Completely unexpected.  




 John McClane in a battle against himself....to quit smoking.  




 I'll see this if Bill Paxton returns to talk about his small dick more and drop words like "buttermilk" again.  




 The anticipated third installment: Fun with Wick and Jane 




 This time Gary Sinese actually gets to go.  




 They should play that as a Double Feature with Judd Apatow's next movie: The is 41: Debbie dies 




 I had never even heard of this and had to look it up. Any good? 




 City Slickers 3: Come and Get Me 




 The fake sequel to a movie that explains the premise in its title 




 What other reasons? He thought Robin Williams would be a better Batman? 




 Verdict? 




 WHO THE FUCK UPVOTES THIS SHIT??
