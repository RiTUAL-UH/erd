 Like constantly walking around with a taser, or having my boyfriend accompany me? I do. The reality is. It can still happen. 




 Thank you! I'll keep all that in mind! I'll look through some of my favorite books and study up on the dialogue! 




 Thank you so much! I'll definitely try those! 




 So, I have a book lined out and ideas completed, but I have a horrible time with dialogue. I know the characters and how they are, but when they talk to one another, it seems like a bad movie or a cheesy rom-com. Any suggestions? 




 In the novel I'm writing, I plan on having the man in love with the main girl, and she kills him in the end. So many would-be da girls would throw their books across the room. I want to break that stereotype. She then goes on to rule the land without a husband or children 




 I would totally want to read something like that! 









 There was a story a lot like your's. I don't remember the name exactly, but she completely ignored its presence and it dissipated after awhile. Might try that. 




 I think that the pros just didn't like Reach and 4, so they quit because most of them came back for MCC competitions. 




 He is so beautiful! I will post a picture when I get his Christmas presents! Baby socks! Also, sorry about the deleted reply! I didn't realize I was on my boyfriend's account! 




 Sure will! :)
