 With the exception of the first 2-3 episodes the CG for Space Battleship Yamato 2199 were great. The space battles are amazing. 




 The inconsistent quality of character animation remained distracting though. At first, I thought it was the weird combo of CG and limited animation frame rate but the characters really just had robotic animation. Oh well, sacrifices had to be made to produce those awesome full animated (24 fps) action scenes.

Hopefully Polygon fixed their character animation for Ronia, the Robbers Daughter .

 The action looked good with nice camera movement. The MC and her sister's CG model looked fine but everything else was an eyesore.

The worst thing about this was those 10 minutes had zero storytelling. 









 We need more Gintama. I miss Kagura. 









 [Zankyou no Terror Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/zankyou-no-terror-episode-11.html) 




 Such a heartwarming show about friendship, growth and finding a joy in something among friends.

Even though there's an overload of cuteness (which I didn't mind) and a few sappy moments, the show didn't really depend on these to carry the characters and the story. These were just aspects that complemented the core of the show, which is the sincerity of the bond between these characters. 














 Lovely use of [eyeline match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeline_match) in this [sequence](http://imgur.com/a/M9S2k). First we see Tanaka looking out the window. The reflection of the crows makes it obvious what's he's looking at. Then it cuts to the crows themselves. Next cut is Daichi looking up at the same crows. A nice flowing continuity from one shot to another that also creates a sense of connection between the two characters.

[Haikyuu!! Episode 25 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-25.html) 




 Let's see. Saazbaum attempted to kill the person that Slaine loves the most and started a war that killed millions or maybe billions of people. Then Saazbaum learned that the princess was still alive and made his intention to kill her clear to Slaine. And yet Slaine felt compelled to save him.

There's very little between Slaine and Saazbaum that should outweigh his love for Seylum or simple logic. Yes, Saazbaum spared his life but it wasn't exactly out of mercy or that he valued him as a person. The thought process of, "Hey, I would totally kill you but I owe your father one" isn't exactly a sign of goodwill. If that was enough then Slaine isn't so bright. Well, maybe I'm discounting the effectiveness of Saazbaum's slide show presentation of his feelings. 

As heart-wrenching that episode was the lasting impression is how the clumsy writing made Slaine look like a huge idiot, which really shouldn't be the case.  




 He sure found a balanced diet. 









 [Tokyo Ghoul Episode 12 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/tokyo-ghoul-episode-12.html) 




 Probably should've done hair loss treatment and transplant earlier in the balding process like Tom Brady did so it wouldn't have been as noticeable. Well, Brady also had the advantage of wearing a helmet. 




 Haven't seen the show but I approve of using a Soil and Pimp song for the [OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQf-NkWz7Yo). We need more Soil and Pimp in anime. 




 The last two episodes adapted the most emotional parts of the manga really well. Dare I say, it did them even better since I didn't get these feel while reading the manga.

People want a second season but this might be one of those rare times that an anime original ending might be preferable. Unless you're in a mood for wishy washy romance melodrama. I certainly was at the time so I still found it entertaining  but there was a definite drop-off in quality. 




 The OVA sold well. I'm hoping that would encourage making another season.  









 I would totally watch an anime about some dude romancing a single mother. 




  This strike anyone else as being... low?  I'm guessing that the majority of the hype was due to Netflix picking it up, which doesn't really affect Japanese sales. Nonetheless, great show.

The manga is not really popular so these sales seem fine. Also the series is only sold as BDs, which is baffling. Not having it available in DVD is money left on the table.  




 The talk with Takeda and the meal were delicately well handled. They were those scenes that let the moment speak for itself and let the audience absorb what's happening.

edit: [Haikyuu!! Episode 24 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-24.html) 









 I love how moody the intro was. Kind of wish that the episode maintained that.

I think the storyboarding carried that scene. The insert shots of the glasses were timed so well with the dialogue.

[Space Dandy S2 Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/space-dandy-s2-episode-11.html) 




 That "Queen" Revy. Damn. 




 To be fair, I think fitting large amount of exposition into the story is easier done in books than a visual medium. 









 Maybe he has a doting younger sister holding back his power. 




 This show actually handles escalation quite well. Despite Tatsuya being OP as hell his feats remain exciting because they don't get flaunted that often until the right moments.

Shameless plug: [Anime Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/) 




 Your complaint has been less and less of a problem lately, at least with the shows that I've been watching. Take Akame ga Kill for example. It's a rather low budget looking show but the dialogues are handled competently.

Let's use this scene as an example: http://a.pomf.se/olnybc.webm

Shot by shot breakdown

Establishing shot  a wide shot that gives a sense of time and place. The two characters are at a dinner table and its late afternoon (sunset colored sunlight)

Medium close-up of prime minister

High angle shot behind the prime minister with the camera tilting  yes this fits your complaint about characters talking while facing away from the camera but this actually serves a purpose. The camera tilting to the prince is a visual of the dialogue flow with him at the receiving end.

Medium close-up of the prince (continuity from the tilt shot)

Medium shot of prime minister (shot reverse shot). Prince holds up a paper and PM looks at it.

Cut to an eyeline match of what the PM is looking at, which is the paper with a list on it (again this is continuity from the last shot).

Close up of PM (with some badly done shallow focus) and then prince (shot reverse shot). The close ups give a better sense of their predicament.

Re-establishing shot, slow zoom out and fade out to black.

The cinematography wasn't elaborate. It wasn't compositionally heavy, although the arc in the background was used as a framing element and the ray of light as leading lines. But, IMO it wasn't stale shot making and had a decent grasp of visual continuity.
 




 Rafael asks: 

In film, the camera is one of the most basic yet powerful tools of expression in a filmmaker's arsenal. As you are a film scholar, I'm sure you already know the power of a well-composed shot. My question is this: Anime relies a lot on static shots, largely for budgetary reasons (moving backgrounds, characters on a rotating dolly shot, etc. are hard to animate as perspective changes). There's not a lot of tracking/dolly/crane/steadicam shots in anime. Knowing how much the movement of the shot (or lack thereof) influences how the audience views a scene emotionally, how do you think has anime's reliance on static shots influenced its cinematic language? Do you think they've explored techniques in the static shot enough so that they don't have to rely so much on tracking shots to communicate the same emotions? I'm aware that there are numerous other things that affect the shot composition, but I wanted to ask about static shots specifically. 

**Moving the camera is actually something that didn't pop up much in motion picture history until relatively late. Early silent film cameras were bulky and heavy, and moving them was just too difficult. (You may have seen footage of a giant merry-go-round built for doing chase scenes in the silent era. The merry-go-round was for the actors and set, while the camera stayed on the ground.) This started to become less of a problem towards the end of the silent era, but then when talkies came the additional burden of the sound equipment and having to stay absolutely silent during shooting put a damper on adventurous camera technique. It took a long time for cinema to recover from the stiffness introduced by microphones. While cameras might have been able to shift around in place on a tripod, actually moving the camera, and the devices with which that could be done smoothly like dollies or jibs (mini-cranes for cameras) were things that had to be invented after that point, starting in the late 1930s. Hand-holding the camera was often too shaky until the Steadicam was invented, and that didn't become commonplace until the late 1980s.**

**Animation had similar limitations in that you could always move the camera, but doing so was a lot more trouble than it was usually worth. The low-budget nature of anime also meant that new inventions that made such things easier were slow in coming to Japan. Multi-plane animation techniques pioneered by Disney in the 30s and 40s (which you see as different layers of backgrounds panning across the screen at different speeds) didn't get used much in anime until the 1970s. And Japan pretty much skipped the early computer-aided drafting era of animation in the late 80s, not integrating computers into their workflows until early 2000s. So, for a very, very, very long time -- until the last decade, really -- anime creators were pretty much stuck with only the camera techniques they could draw by hand.** 

**Luckily, this worked quite well when combined with Japanese filmmaking, which leans heavily on the Yasujiro Ozu school of long, still shots, with cuts to close-ups for dramatic effect, and cuts to random little asides (a piece of litter, a glass of water -- Ozu called these "pillow shots") as a rhythmic pause, as if the life of a scene is taking a breath. The technical limitations of anime and that style of filmmaking work very well together, which is probably why the art form is so heavily influenced by it, whereas Japanese live action filmmaking has long since moved on.** 

**I think the economy with which the camera moves in anime tends to inherently give those shots more importance. A moving point of view shot happens so seldom, and the craft in which things move is so labored and clearly difficult, that it can't help but make an impression. It's similar to how body language is portrayed in anime: every twitch of a finger, every eye movement was a deliberate choice by the animators, and is important; it's never because an actor had a fly land on them or has an itch. That extra motion doesn't happen very often, so when it does, we take notice, and try to observe why it's happening. It adds meaning to a scene.** 

**There are still moving camera shots that take my breath away: hand drawn ones like the subway shoot-out in Kite, or the opening shot in The Heroic Legend of Arslan. There are moving camera shots that make me chuckle because they couldn't quite pull it off, like an early scene in Black Magic M-66 where the camera chases two people running through the woods, and the perspective of all of the passing trees gets completely screwed up. Even Paprika, which was an all-digital work, made innovative use of changing perspective in several shots, to breathtaking effect.** 

**Lately, I think some of the best, most pioneering work in terms of changing-perspective animation can be found in some of the insanely intricate swimming scenes in the current season of Free! That show is visually mind-blowing, even if all of the exposed flesh in that show does nothing for you.**

 [Shiki vs Lio alley fight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VPDTQViU3c), I thought was the best fight scene of the series and maybe one the best in anime. I actually liked the first half of that movie, too bad the second half took a nose dive. 









 I'm glad Naru's fall wasn't made into a big drama and was appropriately used to strengthened the bond between the four and as a feel good moment.

[Sally-sensei's Yosakoi](http://gfycat.com/DescriptiveDelectableBluebottlejellyfish) 




 Samurai Flamenco 




 A writer/director can come up with a safest premise that's moe-centric and panders to the otaku and still not get funding for a $500k 24 minute OVA. Let's get real, that's too expensive and not a sound investment. 




 [Mushishi Zoku Shou Special - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/mushishi-episode-11-and-12.html) 




 The reactions to Kageyama being complimentary were funny. Chemistry between the characters is the best aspect of this show.

That Oikawa flashback was awkwardly inserted. Probably would've worked if done in between sets or during a timeout. 




 I'm not even sure if they're actually adoptive siblings, or Akari just started calling him Onii-Sama because they're close childhood friends. 














 I think she's an amusing one note character. She fits the guilty pleasure vibe of the series. 




 Kind of disappointing the it's not his. I was ready to add AI and Robotics Expert to his resume.

 Don't deny it. Just accept the power of the lewd. 




 She ain't dead. That ship would be totally useless without her. Unless they turn her dead body into Aldnoah fuel. 

I feel that some of the story details in this episode like Marito's past and the state of Martian politics and society should have been revealed earlier and would've gave the story/characters a stronger foundation.  




 I've been watching some older anime lately, like Future Boy Conan, Maison Ikkoku, Utena and Touch. The voice acting were fine but they weren't some revelation exposing me to the wonders of pre-2000's voice work.

I do understand the complaints about high pitched voices but when shows have teenage girls being voiced by full grown women then of course it would sound unnatural as they try to adjust their voice to match a younger age.

[First 10 minutes of Tomino's new show, Gundam Reconguista in G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN3KN5Xlo8U). Again, the voice work is fine but nothing special. On the other hand, that Yugo Kanno OST is sounding amazing. 




 Kokutou just loves crazy. 




 Gainax animation at its peak was that epic Asuka fight scene and the The Wings of Honnamise rocket launch. 




 Another LOGH thread made the front page of /r/all a few days ago. Hopefully that got more people watching. 




 I need to catch up on some western shows anyway. 









 Eh, they just don't want to admit that they messed up on Hosada. 




 The show is hit or miss but some of the hits are really good.

This episode (S2 episode 8) isn't guitar themed but the soundtrack for it is great. Great episode by the way, even if you end up not liking the story (I didn't like it that much either), everything else was exceptional (cinematography, animation, art, etc.) and a delight to watch.

I would also recommend S2 episode 5. Probably the best episode of the series. 









 It was predictable that something bad would happen, but with characters so likable and so easy to root for the expected mishap still leaves an effect.

Sally-sensei might save the day in the next episode and perhaps change Machi's view of her.

Stay strong Naru. The Princess, The Tsundere and The Blond got your back.

 [Space Dandy S2 Episode 8 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/space-dandy-s2-episode-8.html). 









 Bob cut looks great on Senjougahara and Tsukihi. The rest look better with long hair. 




 The show's animation, character and ship designs can use a remake. The first season's character design had some mannish looking women. 




 I'm no chemist but the potassium chlorate can act as an oxidizer for the initial ignition. The oxygen in the air maintains it. Whether that initial ignition is enough to start a reaction in a Hydrogen filled atmosphere might be the question.

The head of "strike anywhere" matches contain an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate together with tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, glass and binder.  The phosphorus sulfide is easily ignited, the potassium chlorate decomposes to give oxygen, which in turn causes the phosphorus sulfide to burn more vigorously.


The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder.  The side of the box contains red phosphorus, binder and powdered glass.  The heat generated by friction when the match is struck causes a minute amount of red phosphorus to be converted to white phosphorus, which ingnites spontaneously in air.  This sets off the decomposition of potassium chlorate to give oxygen and potassium chloride.  The sulfur catches fire and ignites the wood.

http://depts.washington.edu/chem/facilserv/lecturedemo/MatchHeadReaction-UWDept.ofChemistry.html 




 This show just has a way of highlighting characters in a very gratifying way. 

Sugawara is definitely better at being a glue for the team and seeing the bigger picture but Kageyama gives them intensity and edge. Kageyama can get overwhelmed mentally while with Sugawara it's physically/athletically. I like how the show presented these differences. 




 I miss Senjougahara. This arc kept dropping her name too, tease. 




 The feels are coming? While I've really enjoyed this show, the emotional and thematic parts weren't very engaging despite being presented well. I think if the show decides to dig a bit deeper it could turn from being a good show to a great one.

It really wouldn't be that surprising if Aldonoah and Persona made A-1 money. 

Also Space Brothers and Fairy Tale are daytime anime and mostly dependent on TV ratings rather than BD/DVD sales. Considering they are/were long running shows I'm pretty sure they made A-1 money.

  Psycho-Pass has some really good songs.

[Yugo Kanno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo_Kanno) needs more love. His OST for Birdy the Mighty is also excellent. 




 I'm hoping for a Lu Gonghu vs Tatsuya showdown. 




 Finally, Asseylum does something. 

Inaho wants that Aldnoah tech that Asseylum can provide and he doesn't want to risk having Slaine get in the way of things. Although, getting that tech comes at the price of prolonging the war and more casualties but Inaho would probably see it as strategically justifiable for the sake of reaching parity with the Martians. I think Inaho will be entering Machiavellian mode.

Of course there's also Asseylum's view on things to be taken into account. The show is starting to get more interesting with all these significant factors coming into play. I hope its handled well and avoids over-simplification or being convoluted. 




 The show was Gundam-esque from the very beginning. 




 You should watch Space Battleship Yamato 2199 for the quintessential battleship badassery.  




  The only thing that I am 100% sure about is that the Martian rebel girl will try to kill the princess after she has outlasted her usefulness. She seems to have a bigger grudge than most of the Terrans and I don't blame her for that.

It's hard to sympathize with her since her father was part of a group that started this whole damn mess that killed millions of people.

 Also, people need to keep in mind that talent development is a fickle thing and having a stacked farm system doesn't guarantee long term success.

2006 D-backs farm system is probably more stacked than this Cubs farm system and only made it to the playoffs twice since then. That prospect class included Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Chris Young and Carlos Gonzalez. Although, Quentin and CarGo were used as trade pieces.

On a more positive side, for the past two seasons the hyped 2010 Royals farm system has been coming to fruition. Although Hosmer and Moustakas have been disappointing.

 Marito needs to get his shit together. That Thousand-yard stare act is getting old. He's starting to resemble Tayback from Tropic Thunder. Asseylum continues to sit on her hands and the show's excuses for it have been fairly poor. I think these two are the most frustrating parts of the show. 

We need more dead pan deliveries from Inaho. That would justify his total lack of emotion. He's also reaching Tatsuya level of tactical omniscience.

 Episodes 47-50 of Cross Game were just perfect.[](/s "Especially "that moment" in episode 47")

 If you want to be enveloped in that heartwarming, serene and fuzzy feeling then watch Aria.

 [Manga spoilers](/s "The frustrations are a big part of the hook though lol. I actually like Kikuchi better than Kou, but these new characters definitely would have been better off if they didn't exist merely for love triangle reasons. When Futaba-Kikuchi finally happened, I actually thought the mangaka might flesh-out that relationship. Nope, it's still love triangle limbo") 




 Eh. Depends on what people are looking for. If they want a serious take on romance and relationships then this ain't it. If they just want a typical soapy drama to enjoy then I think the manga delivers. 




 Naru reminded me a bit of Akari (Aria) with those sentimental remarks. 









 The Tale of Princess Kaguya and When Marnie Was There being big flops really hurt the studio. I guess films without Hayao Miyazaki's name attached to it are hard sells. If From Up on Poppy Hill and Arrietty didn't list him as a writer they probably wouldn't have made as much money, the former likely being a flop.

 Tatsuya the Magical Terminator. I enjoy how his over-poweredness keeps escalating. Such a great guilty pleasure. 




 I think the show could do a better job of presenting the actual dangers that comes with Asseylum revealing herself. As of now it just feels like she's being complacent and her indecisiveness comes across as a plot device, a contrived reason for the ongoing conflict. 

I don't mind exposition since that Mech exploding in the ocean with little explanation would've been a WTF moment but there has to be a better way to do them. These mid-fight and post-fight expositions feel like lectures.

Kidding aside, it's nice to see the industry progress albeit with some obvious growing pains.

 That Asahi spike was so gratifying. 




 The action scenes in this episode were so visually congested that it prevented them from being engaging. The camera was always too close, the insert shots were awkwardly placed and the behind the back shots completely blocked the action.

 Gotta love the match cuts done between the girls' and the boys' game. That was really done well. It expressed the theme of resiliency in two different settings while maintaining continuity. 

When it comes to the more emotional moments, this show shines at a technical level. 




 It's the nostalgia goggles. 




 I just hope he finally gets to keep a job. 




 So, when is Overtime Lovers going to get an anime adaptation.

That whole fujoshi bit reminded of [this Nichijou scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z30Y572EmCk) 




 Good episode with the exception of some awkward exposition towards the end. The enemy mech needing to have openings to receive signals and to walk could've been mentioned during prep time. That would've been enough to make the water strategy to be self explanatory.

I'm also curious about the mechanics of that energy field. The show just can't ignore the law of conservation of mass and energy. 




 Rewatched this a few weeks ago. Still hit me right in the feels.

 I love how the show made fun of itself when Hinata started doing the typical sports shonen hype speech at some random guy.

While the build up was amusing and hyped up the match I thought it took too long. Last episode was basically a build up episode, dedicating another 18 minutes to it seemed rather excessive. 




 [Looks delicious.](http://i.imgur.com/YCM7te0.jpg) 




 Watch LOGH. Believe me, it's worth the time investment.
