 I'd love to know how that went down.

 I've never laughed more than when I watched [Time Chasers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddHfau_ONSw feature=youtu.be)  









 Nope.  




 Quinn Lucas Schansman. He was Dutch-American. 




 at least this made me laugh.  




 That's one hell of a quote. 




 The side of the Pentagon that was hit was also the most vacant (because of renovations). 




 Ugh, Radiator Springs Racers is still like this. They'll be no hope for a couple of years.  




 I wish this was higher. 




 I almost just got sent home from work for laughing too hard at the 20th Century Fox one. 




 He's gorgeous but he's hard to look at for me. Poor Theon. Poor, poor Theon.

Basically 9 people were found dead on a mountain in Russia and it looked like they were running from something.  




 Nice to mole you. Meet you. Nice to meet your mole. Don't say mole. 

^I ^said ^mole. 




 I actually got excited until I saw the link. What does that say about me? 




 I don't know, what do you want to do? 




 I think your throw away just needs to subscribe to the subreddit.  




 Thank you. I'll take the custom insoles out of the shoes and try running with the factory ones. Hopefully that will make all the difference!  




 I'll try to loosen them.  




 I thought I'd need better shoes for longer runs.  




 Probably Fanboys. I watch it every time I am home sick.  




 Ah the license to breed.  




 I mean your'e not wrong.  




 That was so adorable. 




 Content for now.  




 Nothing is nothing. You don't feel anything, you're just gone. There is much worse than nothing, I promise you.  




 John Brunson.  I'll bet you and I have met. That whole thing broke my heart. 




 Was this in Chicago? If so, I knew him too.  




 Back in the day women used to take their maiden name as a middle name when they got married to better track lineage. Or so I've heard.  




 There's worse out there than that statue, we are beginning to discover. Once I have more details, you'll hear about them.  




 Some details have been changed out of necessity, including timing.

 This one scared the crap out of me but I couldn't stop reading. 




 Ths story is quite rubbish, the picture must have really contributed to it's popularity.

 I think someone may be hiding under my bed every night waiting to slash my ankles. 




 I fucking love you too. 




 His tail was much, much longer, yes. I could try and draw it but I'm a terrible artist and your own idea of what it looked like may be more interesting anyway. 




 That's the worst of it, really. If Metaraxes consumes an individual it's likely killing more than just that one person (their children etc). I suppose that's why time is more complex around him. 

You may have had one - Eyeglass's went for about $399 if I remember, but they last for like 100 hours. I always wanted a pair.  




 Their car was gone. No idea if they ever found their way out of the woods. 




 Thanks for the info. Also, some things have been changed to conceal the actual location of Deepwood. 




 This drawing is absolutely excellent  




 It is, yes.  




 Dammit this was on my bucket list.  




 Thank you! Well, to be honest I haven't spent much time on the East Coast for obvious reasons.

 [The Lost Town of Deepwood, Pennsylvania](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xn677/the_lost_town_of_deepwood_pennsylvania/) 
 
[Return to Deepwood, Pennsylvania](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29htgx/return_to_deepwood_pennsylvania/)

I padded quietly through the dimly lit gift shop, pulling the straps of my backpack tighter over my shoulders like a security blanket. When I reached the opposite door, I leaned my head against it and tried to calm my rapidly beating heart. 

Taking several deep breaths, I slid Scottss keycard through the blinking card reader and was rewarded with a green flash and another soft click. The creature was right where Id left it, as still as the statue it was pretending to be. 

I took my time wandering around the room, my eyes never leaving Jameson Scotts prize exhibit. If the demon was as satisfied and successfully warded as Scott bragged it was, than the creature either wouldnt notice or wouldnt care about my presence.  I was starting to hope he was right. 

When I finally came around to face the statue, I approached it slowly and unbuckled the velvet rope with a shaky hand. I was so close to it now that all I could see when I looked up was the underside of its gigantic head. I suddenly wondered if years of schooling would help me read the words inscribed on the statues stone platform. I bent down and started to pull up the velvet covering when I heard a quiet scrape above me, like stone on stone. It was a sound Id heard before, in the soundtrack of my nightmares.
 
 So I had been right all along, the statue wasnt dormant. It was a hollow victory. I dropped the velvet and backed away from the statue, trying to determine what had moved. Nothing had changed to my naked eye, but I know what I heard.

Bumping against the back wall, I decided to play a wild card. I needed it to move perceptibly if I wanted proof that the thing was still dangerous. I turned away from the demon and faced the wall, using an arm to brace myself. I couldnt believe I was doing this.

I pushed my chips all in. 

Do you really think Im scared of you, after all these years?" I asked quietly, my voice echoing around the room like a gunshot. "Youre just a piece of rock now. Harmless to me. 

 I held my breath and waited. Nothing.

Feeling both disappointed and relieved, I sighed and turned around, dropping the keycard as well as my jaw. Though it hadn't made a sound, the statue was now not only facing me, but leaning out, as far off its stone platform as it could. Its mouth was open and, almost imperceptibly, growing wider by the second. 

You cant leave your platform. I breathed, as much to myself as the creature. My whole body was shaking and I was quietly backing up, slowly, slowly to the door. I'd gotten what I'd come for, now it was time to leave.

It happened in the breath of a second. There was a sudden crack as the demons tail whipped through the air behind it from one side to the other, as though it were not made of stone but of flesh and blood. The glass encasing it on either side shattered, the makeshift wall behind split in two and the velvet ropes came crashing down; one of the poles sent a sigil flying across the room. 

I screamed like Id never screamed before as the creatures neck seemed to stretch across the room toward me, one of its wards no longer effective. I turned my back on it and ran for the door realizing too late that the keycard now lay under a heap of rubble. I reached the double doors and tried to jerk them open, hoping they werent locked from the other side. They were.  The creature was once again still as stone, everything but its eyes, which followed my every move, hungrily.
I beat on the door, yelling for security and wondering if I was doomed and which thought would be my last. In my hysterical panic I suddenly remembered how I had escaped this fate 13 years before. I stumbled back from the doors as much as I dared and ran at them, shoulder first.

They moved, creaked even, but ultimately laughed at my efforts. These were no rotten, decaying church doors. Crazed with fear I backed up to try again and this time just as my shoulder reached the door, it opened from the other side and I went spilling over on top of something hard  or someone. 

He rolled over and I passively registered that Id landed on an enraged Bannock. He was standing and pulling me up by the strap of my backpack before the door had even closed behind us.  

Bannock struggled to say something, trying several times, but was too angry for words. I didnt care; I threw my arms around him just happy to be on the other side of the door. 

He didnt hug me back, just froze stiff and waited for me to get off of him. When I finally pulled back, I pulled my hood down and looked him full in the face. He wore a decidedly guarded look.   

Did you see what it did? I asked, pushing hair back from my face, That thing is not dormant at all. Tell your boss that, and that it needs to be moved. Tonight, if possible.

In lieu of a response, Bannock grabbed my arm and headed toward the lobby. Since it was away from the exhibit room, I didnt care; he could take me to jail if he wanted, as long as Jameson Scott heard what happened here. Id made my point to him and lived to tell the tale. 

Or had I? I suddenly wondered.  Honestly if Id learned anything in that room, it had been that the creature hadnt forgotten me- the girl that got away. My life was a black mark on its record, an insult.  And I had gone into its lair and challenged. What did I *think* was going to happen?

Of one thing I was abruptly certain: it wouldnt stop until it had my life. The creature would burn through a hundred cities, perhaps a thousand, to claim me. It had told me all of this somehow, hadnt it?

I suddenly realized my mistake. The creature had been dormant when Id arrived in Lannenburg as itd been dormant 13 years before in Deepwood. And once again I had awoken it from a harmless slumber. How many would pay the price this time?   How many people had to die before the end? 

Finally understanding the true cost of my arrogance, I let out a muffled cry and faltered, wondering with revulsion if perhaps I should just go back and face my fate. 

Wait. I coughed, trying to ply the guards fingers from my arm.

Bannock suddenly spun me around and pinned me against a wall, his arms braced on either side of my head. My eyes snapped up at him in shock and I recoiled from what I saw there.

"What the fuck are you doing here?"

"I was, I was just-

"Why did you come back, Katie? After all these fucking years?"

My objection died in my throat. But it couldnt be. It wasnt possible. And yetsomehow it was.

My legs gave out under me, but Jamie caught me on the way down. He was older than he should have been, and stronger than I'd ever thought the skinny kid from Middlesbrough could be. But his eyes hadn't changed, and it was Jamie all the same. Even his expressions were familiar to me, I realized. What I'd first thought was seething anger was actually just barely controlled fear. Had the creature killed me after all? Was I swirling in the dark abyss with Jamie and all the others who had been taken?

"Jamie?" My voice broke over his name.

"Christ, Katie, you need to leave now and never come back. Hell, leave the country if you can. Hell never stop looking for you now."

I couldnt register what he was saying. Who wouldnt? Leave what country? Jamiehow was Jamie here? He kept me pinned there; his hold rigid, his eyes desperate and little bit pissed off.

"Jamie," I tried again, "how did you..."

"How did I know you'd come here? When has the word no ever kept you from something you wanted?"

"No, I mean how-"

"We'll take her from here, Bannock.  A voice behind him interrupted me. 

Jamie slowly turned to face the three men, only one of which I recognized.

"This one has been too much trouble. I want her gone." Jamie returned with ice in his voice.

"Mr. Scott says we're not to take orders from you anymore, Bannock. Give her here."

Jamie suddenly pushed me out of the way and I went sliding across the floor, the wind knocked out of me.  A rushing filled my ears as I tried desperately to catch my breath. When my hearing came back, Jamie was yelling at me.

 Go!

I looked back to see two men down and Jamie struggling with the third. My sneakers struggled for purchase on the slick marble floor and when they finally found it, I was up and running toward the lobby on the wings of adrenaline. I suddenly heard a sound like a book slamming onto a table. 

I spun around just as Jamie went down, clutching his shoulder. He fell on top of the man hed been struggling with  who was now unconscious.   Blood began to drip over his fingers and I went sliding across the floor as I tried to stop to double back for him. 

Jamie started to say something but passed out mid sentence. His hand dropped from his shoulder and thin tendrils of blood began to race each other down his chest.

"Well, now that is impressive," Jameson Scott stepped forward from where hed been leaning against the door. "And Im not impressed by much at my age."

I stumbled over to Jamie, but Scott stopped me with a single click of his gun. He walked over and rested a foot on Jamies chest. I froze where I was. 

"I saw you take my keycard, you know. You played the role perfectly. In fact, *everything* went according to plan. Except him. Scott kicked Jamie in the ribs but he didnt make a sound.

"What do you want?" I spat.

"Your name came up. I want you to die."

"Why?"

Scott gave a pretentious scoff. "This isn't a James Bond movie, Miss Ross, I don't need to explain myself to you."

"But you will, wont you? You want me to know how clever you are." I was playing with fire but why not? We were far beyond caution now. 

"Hmm, you're quite bright. There might have been a place for you on my staff...if things had been different."

"Don't flatter yourself. Why then? Why are you giving a demon what it wants? Didnt it kill someone you loved?"

"My daughter, actually. And why? Its my gift to a world I was born too late into. You know, I was fifty by the time the internet was invented - fifty! What sad irony then, that I was a technological genius. Oh but the universe does love its sick jokes. Do you realize Ive single-handedly guided the history of modern technology? Its true. But I reached my seventies and then my eighties, and my vision began to fail, my hands would shake, I'd forget coding. I could barely manage to read at one point.

I'd made millions, but I hadn't even started. I decided the world couldn't afford to lose me yet. So, I tracked down every piece of ancient lore I could that may help me reclaim my youth. Most of it was rubbish, of course, but I was desperate. Id almost given up  until Metaraxes found me.

I knew what he was as soon as I saw him. So I bought him and warded him using the sigils I'd read about in ancient text.  Of course, there was an expensive trial and error period; many of my staff were killed in the process. But eventually, we discovered the right sigils. The first thing I did was track down the man whose name was etched into the granite at Metaraxess feet. I presented him for sacrifice and I was rewarded.

That was six years ago. I adopted a new name and started a new company. All was going well until your name came up about four years ago. It really stumped me because Metaraxes only desires those who are connected to him, somehow. I didn't know who you were and you're far from the only Caitlin Ross in the world. I did *try* several others. Metaraxes would take them, for certain, but the name never changed. I was getting desperate.

So you can imagine how happy I am that you showed up on my doorstep.  God is telling me that he approves of my methods and that I must stay alive for the good of humanity. My company is in the middle of revolutionizing surgical robotics, for Christs sake! I will take a few lives to save a million."

Furious at his arrogance, I struggled to keep my voice level. "Don't lie to yourself, Scott, youre no hero, just an old man afraid to die."

"No, Caitlin, I'm just a man refusing to grow old. What can I say? Im determined and resilient.  I want to be young until the day I die."

"Thats not resilience, thats vanity. Vanity is what youre buying with my life. 

"Theres always a price for social change, Miss Ross. And today, the cost is you. Oh, but you look upset. Don't be afraid of death, my dear, not for such a worthy cause.

"I'm not afraid of death and I don't care about your diabolical plan, I just want you to get to the goddamn point." Jamies breathing was growing shallow and my voice dripped with animosity.

"As you wish." Scott nodded at something behind me and then there was darkness.

When I woke, I was lying on a cold marble floor, my brown mess of hair fanned out underneath me, stiff with dried blood and my wrists bound. I sat up slowly and tried to brush the hair out of my eyes. I knew where I was, there was no point in turning around to see it, but I did anyway.

It wasn't the fact that my name was engraved at the base of the statue that the velvet cloth had covered. It wasn't the wards, which had been moved from the demons feet to the doors and walls of the room. It wasn't even the fact that the demon's head was turned as to be looking directly down at me.

No, what terrified me most in that room was the man leaning against the wall, hands bound behind his back, as condemned to death as I was.

The blood on his chest had dried and he was awake; his eyes only partly open, watching me with an unreadable expression.

"You look like shit, Jamie." I said matter-of-factly as I pulled myself up to lean against the base of the statue, the only thing nearby.

"I've been busy," He said, his mouth curling up into a sarcastic smile.

"I'm sorry I killed you. Again." I tried to smile back, if only to keep the tears at bay.

"Nah, well survive this.

I admire your optimism, but look around. I rested my elbows on my knees and sunk my head into my arms.

I lived through it once before didnt I?

"Yeah about that - how?"

"About a week after you left things started disappearing around town: people, buildings, even roads. No one remembered them but me. Then one day, I woke up in an empty house. My dad and my brother were gone. So, I fled to the only place I knew was safe."

"The Damned Church."

Jamie shrugged. I figured it was the one place the demon would never go. I don't know how long I lived there, but it felt like years. I slept at the church and traveled to nearby towns to steal what I needed to live. And then, one day, the towns were gone. All of them."

As he spoke, I watched him, memorizing every detail of his face. Even when I was nothing, I hoped something was left of me, a little piece that would remember him.

"So, I decided to find the thing. My dad was gone; my mom didn't remember me, and the only person who knew who I was lived a thousand miles away. So I went from town to town until I found it. It was just there; standing in the center of town. Nobody even thought it was weird.

I was a pro at drawing sigils by then since Id spent some much time at Deepwood, and sigils have to be perfect to work, so I tried to ward it. It would take a little while, but the statue always managed to break them. Id find it a little further from its base every night. People didnt even seem to notice the statue had moved, what they did notice, however, was some kid loitering around their town.  Since I looked older, and the town was getting wary of me anyway, I joined the local police force and spent my nights on patrol downtown, keeping an eye on the thing, reapplying sigils. Occasionally, I would wake up outside and I'd know my wards had finally failed. Then I'd have to track it to a new town and start all over."

"Why didn't it just kill you?"

"I asked myself that until a few years ago when your name came up. I think it needed me - to find you. Ironically, in the end it didn't need me at all. You came anyway."

I thought about that and wondered for the first time if I actually *had* come back to prove myself sane. Had I really intended to kill it? Or prove I'd been right? Or had it actually been about Jamie all along?

"It took a long time, and a lot of towns," he continued, "but I finally figured out what I was doing wrong. A sigil will slow it down, but in order to stop it the ward needs to be blessed. And not just by anyone - by the second son of a Roman catholic, preferably from Assisi, Italy, or at least near the region. Don't ask me how I figured that out."

"So what happened to your second son from Assisi, Italy?"

"He disappeared."

"Shit." I pushed my hair back again with my bound wrists.

"Yeah. By that point I was a sheriff and Id been a city over. I came back to town to find my exit missing. The statue was gone. And that's when Jameson Scott got a hold of it."

"And that's why were you protecting him?"

"You think I was protecting *him*? No, he was transparent about his intentions from the start. I applied to be on his detail but was denied - no name, no experience. I only got on because I was able to take out all of his bodyguards in a sort of hand to hand combat trial. Guess all those trips through the police academy finally paid off."

"Agreed. How does Jameson Scott know more about that statue than we do?

 Because he had almost 80 people on his staff who did nothing but travel every corner of the globe looking for any scrap of information on Metaraxes.  We arent the first ones to live to tell the tale. Just the first to stick around.  I did all I could to keep people away from that thing. A name would be engraved on it one day, and a new name the next. It took me a long time to figure out what he was doing. And by then...your name had come up. Hes became obsessed with you and I damned sure wasnt going to let him find you."

"Well that explains why you were mad when you saw me."

"Mad? Katie, I've never been more terrified in my life. I spent years leading him down false paths only to have you present yourself like a lamb for slaughter."

"I'm sorry, Jamie. I wasted all your fucking time.  You spent 13 years trying to protect me and I spent all that time trying to forget you." 

"Well, it's no less than I wanted for you. To forget about this place, and me."

I heard the familiar stone on stone sound from above me. 

"Is there any chance of reasoning with him? Your boss, I mean?"

"Not likely," his voice was dark. "He fed his own daughter to that thing."

He what?!

"For the greater good, he said."

God, Jamie, I don't want to die. I don't want *you* to die."

"You're not going to die here, not today."

I ignored his optimism. "Why do you think it hasn't killed us yet?"

Jamie sighed. "It's trying. Scott kept a close watch over his demon but I managed to get one thing by him. That statue is sitting on a sigil the size of a mini cooper. It's not blessed - but it's big."

"You're a brilliant bastard, James Karras."

"Well, I've sure had a lot of time." I heard a clicking sound and Jamie stood up, tossing a now worthless pair of handcuffs on the floor.

He walked over and stood me up; using whatever tool he had picked his own cuffs with to free me. I heard them click but when they fell to the floor all I heard with the loud grinding of stone on stone again. It was louder and longer this time.
 
"Don't look at it, Katie. Don't look up."

"Jamie..." I breathed, terrified. Suddenly, a face appeared behind Jamie. But this time, I wasnt hypnotized by it. Jamie saw the color drain from my face and grabbed me.

"Follow me- now!" He yelled, pushed me in front of him to the giftshop door. I heard more movement from behind us and turned around while Jamie typed a long sequence of numbers into the card reader keypad. The creature had turned its head and it was watching me. It was alive, as alive as it had ever been. The statue took a step off its platform which shook the museum floor. Its movements were silent, yet fluid and flexible, like a cartoon on mute.

"Jamie..."

"Working on it!" Suddenly the key pad flashed green and the door clicked open. Jamie drew a black marker out of his pocket and drew a long line down the middle of the sigil, negating it. 

"What are you doing?!"

"Just trust me." Jamie pushed me out the door.

We slammed it behind us and tore across the giftshop to the exit. The door was locked. I turned around to tell Jamie as much but he was already hurling a table through the window. It shattered just as I saw the door on the other side of the room begin to bend as it was pushed in from the other side.

"How did you unlock that door?" I asked as we ran across the parking lot.

"Scott isn't the only one who's good with programming." Jamie yelled back. 

I followed him to a black jeep sitting at the edge of the parking lot. We jumped in just as a loud bang echoed across the asphalt, god only knew what it meant. Jamie shoved his keys in the ignition and turned the car over. The beginning chords to Highway to Hell blasted from the speakers.

"Why not?" I shrugged as I turned it up. Jamie nodded and peeled out of the parking lot. We tore through town like the devil himself was chasing us - which wasn't far from the truth.

It was early, the first rays of sunlight streaming through the trees as we hit the highway. We hadn't gone more than 5 miles when a white SUV appeared behind us. It followed at a considerable distance.

"Why aren't they overtaking us?"

"Because this is what he wants. Scott knows where we're going."

"Where *are* we going?"

"Deepwood."

"Fuck." I said as I leaned back in the chair. But I trusted Jamie, so I didn't object.  "Wont it take the creature days to make it there?" I asked, eyeing Jamie's speedometer, which was at 90. 

"It doesn't always move like that. It sometimes travels on another plane. I can't explain it. Everything changes and warps around that thing, even time. Thats why I'm about 8 years older than I should be."

He suddenly whipped off the road and headed for the treeline. The truck behind us did the same and we maneuvered randomly through the trees, though I figured Jamie knew where we were going. I held on for dear life and watched him expertly navigate the almost hostile terrain or downed trees and deep ditches. 

"How far?" I asked after ten minutes.

"6 miles but you know how time is out here." 

Did I ever. Four minutes yet somehow six miles later we bumped over a set of railroad tracks and arrived at the Damned Church, which looked smaller and more impotent than it did in my nightmares. The front door opened easily this time and I gave an involuntary shudder when I saw the Jesus statue - looking more judgmental now than ever before. The trapdoor was open.

"You lived here for years and you never closed the trap door?" 

"Believe me, I tried." Jamie grabbed my hand and guided me to the hole in the floor. "We have to go down there."

"Fuck no. I snatched my hand away.

"It's the only way this will end, Katie."

Youve got to be kidding me, I muttered as I took the first reluctant step down.

"Wait, I suddenly stopped. You said it wouldn't ever come back here."

"It would for you." 

Jamie followed behind me and took the stairs down, on shaky step at a time. Jamie followed behind me, flashlight in hand. I didnt see it until right before we reached the bottom. The demon was already here waiting for us. It stood in the same position we'd first found him in 13 years before, though this time its face was not stone. The demons eyes swept across the room in a wide arc, his tail was wrapped around the bottom of the staircase.

"If he was already down here, why couldnt we stay up there?" I whispered.

"He wasn't."

There were no wards to protect us now, and no where to run. I couldn't help thinking this was a bad plan.

"Well, he's here now, so let's go."

"We can't Katie. If we leave now, he will too."

"Well then what's your plan, Jamie?"

Jamie said nothing, just stared at the demon, who was now staring back at him. Suddenly I felt something like a tug, in the pit of my stomach. I stepped back, and then it happened again. I looked up into the creatures eyes, which had moved to mine and suddenly realized what was happening. There was another tug, harder this time, and I felt my mind, if not my body, being pulled toward the demon's head. A long black tongue jutted out to welcome me and the creatures mouth began to widen. So this was it. The nothingness.

The demons mouth was so wide I could have simply walked into it, if I had a body. The blackness started to close in on all sides, creating a sort of tunnel vision and then, in a violent jolt, I was snapped back into my body, a perfect sigil drawn on my chest in black marker. The creature screamed, an earsplitting sound, and Jamie flung me over his shoulder before I had even reestablished my bearings. We were to the top of the staircase in under a minute, the demon still emitting a deafening wail. 

"I'm sorry!" He yelled "I was sure it would come for me first!"

We burst into the nave, and Jamie, seeing our company before I did, pushed me across the alter toward the crucifixion, which I took out as I fell. I scrambled back, kicking it away from me as I did. By the time I looked up, Jameson Scott was standing in front of the trapdoor, a gun to Jamie's head. His men hung back, but looked eager to get involved at a word from their boss. 

"Get back down there, Miss Ross." 

Fuck you. My last word was drowned out by a loud cracking sound that echoed  through the little church as the spiral staircase came crashing down below. 

"Katie, don't-" Jamie caught a knee to the ribs, some of which I was pretty sure were already broken. I scrambled back further. 

"There's- there's no staircase now. There's no way to get down there."

"Oh, sure there is." Scott sneered. His hired men laughed. "You're going to die either way. At least *this* way, you'll save his life. Metaraxes is trapped down there for the time being, so its to the cellar you must go. Perhaps you shouldnt have injured him by breaking his bond *mid-feed*."

"Katie, Jamie growled. "Dont be fucking stupid. Just run.

"Fuck no, Jamie. I didn't leave you in this place then and I wont now." It was time to pay my dues. I stood up to walk to the edge of the trapdoor. Perhaps, if fate was kind, I would die when I hit the floor thirty feet below. 

I looked up at Jamie, intending my last words to be for him. I knew the moment he realized that intent. 

Jamie jerked his body forward and threw himself and Scott into the dark hole between us.

"No!" I screamed as Scotts men scattered out the door. I skid over to the side of the hole, tripping over the smaller statue on the way.

'I'm here," came a pained groan from Jamie, who was just barely clutching onto the side. Thanking every deity I knew of, I pulled him out of the hole and back into the nave. His wound was bleeding fresh blood and I knew we didn't have much time. I laid him on his back, as he started to slip in unconsciousness, applying pressure to his shoulder. A moan came from the trapdoor beside us.

"Help me. Please... I'm hurt." So Scott had survived the fall. I grimaced and pulled myself over to the edge to peer into the darkness below. I could see nothing but the creature was no longer screaming. My blood began to boil as I let Jameson Scott wail away his swan song. 

"Please...its staring at me, I can feel it. Pleasename your price, Ill pay it. Just save me"

I laughed. "Oh now, why would I do that, Mr. Scott? This is what you wanted, after all. You get to be young until the day you die." 

Suddenly the trapdoor slammed shut, Jamie standing over it, as the entire building began to shake. The edges around the door grew bright, like molten metal before darkening like a blown out flame.

"Will it hold?" I yelled to Jamie over the increasingly loud earthquake. "Is it blessed?"

"Some say by God himself."

"I'd say that counts." I said to myself as I tried to stand up on the violently shaking floor.

Jamie hoisted me up next to him and ran for the door as bit of ceiling began to cave in. The door to the church swung open of its own volition before we got there and slammed shut behind us. The church came down in a butt of dust and splintered wood. When all had settled, Jamie was barely conscious. I walked him to the car and pushed him into the passenger seat. He was out before Id shut the door. I took one last look at the pile of rubble before climbing into the drivers seat and starting the car. I followed the same train tracks home that got us out of Deepwood when we were kids. I made it to the road without ever looking back.

I can tell you exactly how long Jameson Scott lived - 4 days. By the dawn of that forth day, he, and all of his inventions, abruptly disappeared from the world. There were a few I was sad to see go, like the rise of inductive charging and EyeGlass. You would have loved EyeGlass and you probably did, honestly.  Contact lenses that were actually cameras: they put GoPro out of business. I could never afford it, but you may have had one. I miss those YouTube videos. 

Jamie spent a month recovering from his gunshot wound. After he was released from the hospital, we spent a few weeks weighing our options. In the end, we decided to hunt down people like Jameson Scott and the powers they wielded. You don't know about them, and if we have our way, you never will. Due to Jamie's time with Scott, we have some good leads. We have a lot of blood on our hands to atone for, and a lifetime to do it in. 

Deepwood is dead; only Jamie and I even know where it is, so the town dies with us. I wouldn't try to find it if I were you - Ive changed a lot of details: names of towns, names of roads. Perhaps even *when* this all happened. I won't tell you and you don't want to know, anyway.

Somewhere, out in a hundred mile sea of trees and dirt lies the demons door. It's still there, under a pile of rotting detritus that used to be a small church. The door may be found again someday, it may even be opened. But one thing is for damn sure: it sure as hell wont be because of me.

 Guilt can be a very strong and blinding motivation.  




 Yes, well, I never said I was smart. And Happy Cake Day, stranger. 




 I'm sorry, I ran out of room. I will post the rest tomorrow.  




 [The Lost Town of Deepwood](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xn677/the_lost_town_of_deepwood_pennsylvania/)

Harrisburg is an antiquated, yet charming Pennsylvanian town on the Susquehanna River with roots reaching back into the 18th century. At least, thats what the tourism brochure read. Id really have to take their word for it.  I had researched a lot of Pennsylvania townships in the last year, but this wasnt one of them.

I handed the brochure back to the tall, red faced girl behind the hotel desk. She sniffed loudly as she took it and unceremoniously slid my credit card back across the counter at me.

Thanks, I muttered.

The girl dropped a brass key on the counter which I eyed with suspicion. I hadnt seen a hotel with actual brass keys since I was a kid. I didnt know if it was my limited funds or Harrisburgs antiquated charm at work, but either way, it sent an involuntary shudder down my spine.

"Room 217. Check outs at 10. The girl said, wiping her small, watery eyes with the back of her sleeve.

I picked up my luggage and shoved off to find my room. 

Eager to be done with it, I hadnt bother to ask where to find room 217. When I finally located it on the other side of the building, I was exhausted and ready for whatever awaited me on the other side of the door. It was as youd suspect: dated, droll and dusty. I took a short shower and spread my maps out on the painfully flat yet somehow still lumpy hotel mattress.

It was strange to be back in Pennsylvania after all these years. Honestly, I was just happy it was still here. I had spent years trying to pretend I'd dreamed it all. Trying to convince myself that I'd had a very vivid psychotic breakdown and I'd never actually been to Pennsylvania at all. And I might have believed it too - if it weren't for Jamie.

He was as real to me as the face in the mirror. I couldn't have dreamed him up if I'd wanted to. And if he had been real, than so had everything else. The Damned Church, the Demon and the hell I'd brought down on Middlesbrough. How many more had died since then? I needed to see for myself. I needed to prove I wasn't crazy, even if doing it meant I would have to face the consequences of my actions - the death.  

I stared at my notes and topographical maps until my vision began to blur. Id been researching and preparing for this trip for a year and yet, here I was, in Pennsylvania, still with no real direction.

It had been thirteen years since Id stepped foot in this state and only for one of them had I considered coming back. 

Id lived only half a life for  the last decade, slowly suffocating under the heavy, pungent cloak of guilt. Usually, I could escape it in Ambien laced dreams or when I was utterly black out drunk - which is an easy order to fill when you work in a bar. But a year ago, my tricks had abruptly stopped working and it had been too long since Id come up for air. Id known it was time to go back.

I spent an hour trying to find a comfortable position on the worn-out hotel mattress. When that failed, I picked up the maps again and studied their details, though Id memorized them all. I suppose I was waiting for something to just click, some small detail Id overlooked that would suddenly make all the difference; a clue as clear as daybreak that had been in front of me all along. But none came and when I woke again it was buried under a pile of legal pads and maps and suffering a sore back.

I showered again, not trusting the comforter, and reluctantly drank the motor oil that passed for breakfast blend coffee. I packed up my research, checked out of the hotel and sat in my car watching the sun slowly brighten the populated downtown area. At least the creature hadnt made its way here; this city had a population of around 50,000. But how many other cities with similar populations were gone because of me? It wasnt something I wanted an answer to.

Since I had no other data to go on, my plan was to drive to the least populated areas and see if what wasnt there would give me a clue to what had once been. Basically, I was looking for an area that by all logic should have a city  but didnt.

I put the Ford Focus in drive and headed west out of town.
Half a day was spent driving to the middle of the state and another two days aimlessly driving around central Pennsylvania looking for something familiar; a mountain, a water tower, a road, *anything*. But it was as if Id never lived here at all.

On the fourth morning, discouraged and frustrated, I checked out of yet another shitty motel. I only had three more days before my flight back to Arizona and so far the trip had been utterly useless.

The man at the front desk took my key and gestured toward the continental breakfast of prepackaged muffins and 
horse-piss coffee.

No thanks, I grumbled.

Wheryeadded?

Huh? I raised an eyebrow at him.

Where ye headed? He repeated, more slowly. I couldnt place his accent, the closest I could get was maybe southern.

Oh, ah, I dont know.

Well, if yer eaded down the 320, gas up before ya leave town. There aint no gas stations or towns between here and Lannenburg.

Butthats like 90 miles away.

Yep, never understood it myself. People get stuck on that road all the time, blowin tires and runnin outta gas. I dont know why the government hasnt done sumthin about that.

Because theyre broke! Someone yelled from the back office.

Yep, thats it, most likely. The state aint got money for it.

Ill get gas before I go, I promised and received an approving nod in return.

I practically ran out the door. For days Id been looking for the out-of-place, the not-quite-right, the bizarre and this waswell, it was odd, at least. And it was all I had.

I gassed up before I left town and followed the signs to the 320. As promised, it was nothing but dark asphalt for miles. No exits, rest stops, signs or ever mile markers. This was it. It just had to be.

Since there was no one else on the road, I drove well under the speed limit taking in every detail. Eventually I began to notice that periodically there would a gap. Not in the foliage, but in the coloring of it. 

Every so often, a grove of trees would be duller, sicker. It was something youd only notice if you were looking for it. So the creature, as Id taken to calling it, could technically give life (in the process of filing in the hole of previous existence) but not very good life.  The fauna in these spots was  weaker and bore dull, almost muted coloring.

I continued noting these spots until I couldnt count them anymore. These had likely been cities or homes of people with lives, families, futures, all taken from them because of me. I felt the panic begin to claim the edges of my vision and quickly popped a Xanax. My panic attacks had become unbearable after Middlesbrough. I suffered from them still. The edges of my vision got hazy and I was able to relax a fraction.

At some point, I processed the presence of the dilapidated railroad tracks running parallel to the road. Id noticed them early on, but my mind had hidden the significance of this until now. They may not have been *the* tracks, but to me, it was a sign that I was on the right track (so to speak).

I was close. I had to be. And if Lannenburg was still there, that meant the creature hadnt made it that far yet.

I somehow knew - like I knew that Id once lived somewhere off this road - that the creature had been moving north. But it hadnt claimed Lannenburg yet. Why? Was it satiated? Had it left the area? Or was it just slow moving? Whatever the answer, I felt Id learn it in Lannenburg.

As I reached the outskirts of the city, I saw my first road sign since Id merged onto the 320.

*Lannenburg*

*Next 17 exits*

I decided to take the exit that would get me into the heart of downtown Lannenburg, if there was one. I hadnt researched the city of Lannenburg either, thinking it was too far north to matter. And yet, here I was.

The downtown area began to take shape off my right like the Damned Church had in the woods so long ago. But I didnt need spray paint to find my way anymore. I exited the highway and drove around the cityscape until I found a centrally located hotel that I could afford. I parked and heaved my bags out of the car, hoping they had vacancy.

They did, I was told by the overly flirty college senior behind the front desk, slinging his guitar behind his back.

Do you have wifi? I asked as he handed me the key card.

We do, but theres a $10 a day charge for the password.

Damn. I was on an extremely tight budget.

But I can give it to you for free if He let his voice trail off suggestively.

If what? I raised a skeptical eyebrow at him.

If you let me write a song about you-  he righted my credit card receipt so he could read it -Caitlin.

I sighed. Ok, yeah, fine. At this point there wasnt much Id say no to. I was going on four days of restless sleep.

He eagerly gave me the password and I retired to my room, first floor, thankfully. I took out my shitty laptop, connected to the hotels equally shitty wifi and pulled up the Wikipedia page for Lannenburg.

It was a larger city for this part of the state, around 55,000 residents, mostly due to the fact that Lannenburg hosted a state university. It was a progressive, young, educated town filled with hipsters and young professionals. Where to even begin?

I threw my notes, my phone and my GPS in my backpack and decided to start with the front desk of the motel, much to my own dread.

The college kid whod checked me in was strumming chords on his guitar and softly humming.

Excuse me.

He looked up at me and winked. Youre pretty eager, foxy lady, and I like that. But songs take time to write, even for the most talented-

Yeah, actually, I was just wondering, where can I find the university? I interrupted - suppressing an eyeroll.

"Mama, this whole city is a campus! I mean, whered you wanna go? You a new student? Ill show you around. I get off in-

No, Id like to find the, ah, the- This had been a horrible mistake. *Think of something quick, genius.* -admissions office. I need to talk to admissions.

Ah, well, thats about half a mile down Rooker Street. Thats the one-

-running in front of the building, got it, thanks.

He started to say something else, perhaps which way to go down Rooker, but I was already out the door. Not knowing what else to do  and wanting to get as far from the poor kid as possible  I picked a direction and started walking.

Even though it was May, I was still freezing. I hadnt been built for the far north and my blood had thinned out living in Arizona. With my backpack and my age I probably would have passed for any other college student on campus  if it wasnt for the hoodie I had pulled tightly around me.

I envied them all. Kids just a year or two younger than me going to classes, hanging out with their friends, making  stupid yet amusing mistakes. It could have been me, once. But I hadn't grown up like them. Even since Middlesbrough I had struggled with school and life in general. I couldn't focus, I couldn't laugh; I became a sarcastic, guilt-ridden introvert and I lost all my friends. Then my dad died and my mom started to look at me differently. I stopped talking about Middlesbrough the day I heard the word "hospital" whispered to my mother by a psychiatrist.

Even though I stopped trying to prove it had all been real, my mother never really saw me as her little girl again. I'd moved out at 18 and lived alone for years, working in an English pub, trying to forget how many people were probably dead because me - including Jamie, the knife that dug the deepest.

I walked the downtown area all day. I didnt know what I was doing, where I was going, who I should approach, or what I should ask them - I just knew I was in the right place. Id been drawn here for a reason; I felt it in my gut. This was where I was supposed to be. But for the fifth time in as many days I had to ask myself: what now?

I suppose I could have spent days wondering around Lannenburg. I could have left empty handed and never known what happened all those years ago. I could have never found him. But, as fate would have it, it only took half a day to find what I was looking for.

It was well past noon and I had stopped at a small caf to eat a sandwich. Since the restaurant was packed wall to wall with students, I went outside and leaned against the brick wall by the door.

I suppose I noticed it because it was so brightly colored. Or maybe because it was the only piece of litter I had seen all morning. Or, just maybe, it was simply because I was supposed to. But for whatever the reason, when a bright red flyer blew past my feet, I reached out to step on it.

Curious, I bent down to pick it up and read the heading:

**Tethen History Museum  Lannenburg, PA**

**Upcoming Exhibitions**

**13th-14th Century Judeo-Christian Relics and Artifacts**

Below that was a blurb about the museum, nothing too interesting. And below *that* was a description of the exhibits to be unveiled.

I skimmed down the list quickly seeing little of interest  until the very bottom.

*Statue of the Demon Metaraxes*

My mouth fell open. It was too much of a coincidence, nothing to be ignored. I checked the date on the flyer. May 2nd 2014: 3 weeks ago. I threw the rest of my sandwich in the trash and took off. Id seen the museum that morning and I knew where exactly where to find it.

It was only three blocks away and I got there in under five minutes, flew up the building steps and stumbled straight to the cashier window.

Student ID, please. The old man said, flatly.

Im not a student.

Well, you look-

How much?

Eleven dollars. I was gladly willing to pay.

I didnt stop to grab a map, instead joining a tour group already in progress. The museum, I could tell, was a veritable labyrinth and I certainly didnt want to get lost, not in here, not with that thing - if indeed, it really was what I half hoped, half dreaded it could be.

It took the longest twenty minutes of my life, but we finally came to the room Id been waiting for.

"Now behind this door is our newest exhibition on ancient Judeo-Christian artifacts. Please do not try to touch anything or you will be escorted out. These pieces are centuries old and may be damaged by the lightest touch.

*If you have behind that door what I suspect you do, than I 
highly doubt it.*

Also, please no flash photography.

My heart beat a million miles a minute as the docent opened the double doors and my group was shuffled in. I lingered toward the back, letting everyone go in front of me.
I had come thousands of miles and done months of research to find that statue, to prove I wasnt insane, yet when the time came to possibly face my nightmare, I was hesitant.
Finally I was the last and the docent had to wave me in with a polite but impatient hand.

There were about a hundred things in that room. All sorts of things, really: sculptures, paintings, pottery, even other statues. But I only had eyes for the thing in the middle.

It was larger than I remembered. Not the twelve feet I had guessed, it was actually closer to twenty. But every detail of its face and body was exactly as Id remembered, though it was positioned differently now.

In the church, all those years ago, it had seemed as if it was standing, waiting yet content. But now it was positioned as if ready to leap off the stone square that it stood upon, its tail was paused in midair, instead of wrapped idly around its legs as itd been before.

Though it was taller than Id remembered, I could at least see its face this time. It wasnt particularly scary, just an empty, stony face, far from the hungry, animated one it became when it woke.

And like the crucifixion statue in the Damned Church, it had eyes only for me.

The rest of my group took photos, oo-ing and ah-ing as they made their way around the room. I stood directly where I was, against the now closed door, going no further. The docent walked around the room, discussing notable pieces of the collection and I only moved from the door when she finally stood before the creature.

"And, finally, the jewel of this exhibition: a granite statue from the 14th century. This is a representation of Metaraxes, a lesser known demon of Christian mythology. It is unique in its size as well as its crisp detail, especially for something so old. Our conservationists are unable to discover its place of origin or creator.

I edged closer and closer to the red velvet rope. Its eyes followed my every step. The room seemed to grow hotter. 

The docent moved to the side so people could get pictures in front of the statue. Though I couldn't blame them, I barely kept from yelling. This was madness.

The stone platform on which the demon stood was covered in red velvet, which pooled at the creatures feet. It hid the words inscribed on the front of the granite stand that Jamie and I couldnt read those many years ago.

The docent droned on about nothing and I read the description plaque.

*14th Century representation of the Demon Metaraxes*

*Artist Unknown*

No shit.

And then I saw what I didnt know Id been looking for  the triangles. The symbols I would never forget, etched into the doors of the Damned Church. And once I found one, I found another and another. There were half a dozen of them. *So thats how theyre doing it.* They (whoever they were) had placed wards all around the base of the creatures stand. 

The museum not only knew what this thing was, they knew about the sigils on the doors of the Damned Church and were *using* them to trap the statue here. The revelation was like a punch to the face. Someone was aware of what this statue really was and was blatantly risking innocent lives anyway. It was insane.

In a panic, I turned to find the docent and saw her conversing politely with an elderly couple. 

Excuse me! I interrupted loudly. 

Yes? She failed to mask her irritation at my rudeness.

Where did the museum acquire this statue?

This piece is on loan from a private collection.

Whose?

It belongs to Jameson Scott. The docent, feeling the exchange was over, turned back to finish her conversation. 

Jameson Scott. I knew that name, but from where? As our group began to move out of the room I took one last look at the creature  Metaraxes  and shuddered. Its eyes had never strayed from me. I took my phone out and pulled up a Wikipedia page on Jameson Scott. I had to know who could be this stupid.

He was young  my age  but wealthy, had his own company and well known in the tech industry for multiple inventions. The words brilliant, pioneer and industry leader were scattered throughout his Wikipedia page, which had no picture. At the end of the article, under Personal Life, was a short paragraph about his interest in symbolism and ancient artifacts.

I shook my head as my group was herded into the museums gift shop. What did he want with the statue? How had he acquired it? And how did he know about the wards? None of it made sense. I wandered through the gift shop idly picking up trinkets and wondering just what to do. Should I warn the docent? The curator? Or did this Scott person know what he was doing.  Were the wards enough? Somehow, I didnt think so.

Are you going to the lecture tonight? Some one asked from behind me.

I swung around, my backpack nearly taking out a postcard stand as I did.

Oh! Sorry, I thought you were someone else. The redheaded girl turned to leave.

What lecture? I asked before she could get away.

The lecture our guide was talking about? I stared at her blankly. Jameson Scotts lecture on the exhibit?

Hes in town?

Yeah, thats what she said, the girl said, flippantly. You should go, hes really hot.

She turned to leave.

Wait- where is the lecture again?

The auditorium in the history building? Building E? She said, as if I should have known. And I guess she wasnt wrong. I was only a few years older than her and I looked like a college student. Apparently everyone thought so.

Thanks! I yelled after her as she walked off with her giggling friend.

I would definitely be there. I had a few things to say to this guy and I wasnt leaving Pennsylvania until I did.

I sat in the back of the auditorium, as was my custom. The room was filled wall to wall with people, faculty and students alike. An empty podium sat in the front and a tall, blonde haired security guard stood to its left. He had a gun on his hip and his hands were folded behind his back. Maybe he wasnt a security guard after all. I was pretty sure state campuses were gun free, which meant he was with somebody important. Jameson Scott, no doubt.

The guard stared straight ahead, his eyes boring a hole into the wall behind me. Lots of things about him made me uneasy.

The murmurs and whispers died down a moment later when a thin, attractive man walked purposefully onto the stage.

Good evening, he began. He graced the room with a smile that couldn't fool me. The emotion didnt quite reach his eyes; if anything he looked like the most stressed out and tired 25 year old I'd ever seen.

My name is Jameson Scott. I am here to speak to you tonight about a few ancient and interesting items I have collected over the years. I'm sorry, but I will not be answering questions about my company, our newest patents or my personal charities."

*Easy, Christian Gray.* I rolled my eyes.

There were a few disappointed groans from the audience but Jameson Scott smiled and directly a flirtatious wink at no one in particular. He was an alarmingly charming man.

"I have been interested in ancient relics, particularly those of religious significance, for many years. Since I was quite young, actually. A somewhat traumatic experience played the catalyst and I've been studying and collecting ever since. I'll begin with some of my more well known pieces and then move on to the more exotic. 

Scott began his lecture on a bowl from Mesopotamia that was supposed to bestow on the user unnaturally long life  as long as you drank from it only water siphoned from the bottom of the Euphrates River. He spoke extensively about several other, equally uninteresting, artifacts before finally coming to the only one I cared about  the statue.

"Please study this photo for a minute." Scott clicked to the next slide in his sideshow and the demon statue appeared against a blood-red background, as imposing and terrifying as it was in real life. A blanket of heavy, uncomfortable air descended on the room as people averted their eyes from the screen and mumbled, uncertainly. I didn't take my eyes off of it.

"This is the piece I spent most of my life trying to locate. May I introduce to you, the demon Metaraxes." He paused for a minute and clicked to the next slide, a Dante-esque depiction of Hell. 

"Metaraxes  belongs to the second hierarchy of demons, though he is virtually unknown  and this is simply because of his nature. Metaraxes doesnt kill or possess. He doesnt vie for power, bring darkness into the hearts of men or try to influence innocence.  Metaraxes eats. But he eats more than the flesh of man, he eats their homes, their histories and their souls. If you were to be eaten by Metaraxes it would be as if youd never existed at all. No one would remember you and the now empty piece of life you had carved out for yourself in the world would fill in as if you were never there. Everything that was you or ever would be you is gone.

Jameson Scott paused artfully to let his words wash over the audience; every soul in the room hanging on every syllable. I suppose it really was quite interesting, if you didnt know the heartbreaking truth of it  which I knew he *did*. For someone hailed as a genius it seemed utterly reckless of him to romanticize all this.  I crossed my arms and slumped lower in my chair. When this was over, one way or another, Jameson Scott and I would be having a conversation. 

And this is why Metaraxes is an unknown. There is no one to speak his name or his deeds, alive or dead. Or there wasnt, for many centuries."

"At some point in history, Metaraxes grew tired of being unknown and un-worshipped. He proclaimed that those who prayed to him and brought him sacrifice would not only be spared and but also given gifts of everlasting youth and resilience  that which he had stolen from others. It is believed that several ancient civilizations took him up on his offer; they sang his songs, built his temples and created beautiful artwork in his likeness - such as the one in your museum - to praise the demon and reap his gifts."

"And this would have gone on for many years until a name was called that refused to be sacrificed. Metaraxes choose his tribute selectively but eventually a name would come up of someone rich or in power and that person would maneuver out of it, or simply commit suicide. In these instances, Metaraxes would grow angry and eat the city and all the people therein, leaving no trace that he, or they, had ever existed. This would have happens many times over the centuries."

Now this was interesting. The creature could be tamed, like a pet, and as long as you gave it the treat it wanted, you would be not only saved but rewarded. 

Something else to consider is that no one ever knew how often Metaraxes called a name. Since the person would be absorbed by the demon, no one would ever remember they had existed at all. It could have been one person a year or five a day and no one would know but the demon himself.

You will find mentions of Metaraxes scattered in religious texts dating back as far as 1700 BC but this statue is rare in that it is the only known likeness of him ever to be found.

Jameson graced the many hands in the air with another tired smile and said, Im sorry but no questions, tonight. If you havent yet had a chance to see the statue of Metaraxes, I encourage you to experience it before it is shipped to New York next month.

Then, without any ceremony at all, Jameson Scott simply walked off stage and the lecture was over.  His security guard, who I realized was more likely a bodyguard, stepped forward to block several girls who jumped the stage to follow his boss. With him busy, I knew I had a chance.

As the throng of people pressed forward to the upper exits, I fell back and went out the rear. I sprinted out of the building and rounded the corner hoping to see what Id gambled was there.

And it was. Jameson Scott was climbing into the back of a white SUV when I spotted him. He glanced in my direction at the sound of his name but then shut the door and rolled down the window as the SUV began to pull away. I threw a Hail Mary.

"Your wards on that demon will never hold!" My voice echoed down the alleyway.

The brake lights came on immediately, but no one exited the car. Taking it as an invitation, I ran up to his window.

For a mere 25 years old, he sure looked like hed seen some shit. His lined, pale, yet attractive face no longer carried a tired look, but a surprised one. I bent over to catch my breath.

He didnt speak, but opened the door and scooted over. I climbed in.

Who may I have the pleasure?

Caitlin Ross, I held out a shaky hand. His surprise seemed to turn to shock.

Caitlin Ross. He said slowly, with a strange inflection of reverence.

Yes, I said, exasperated. Im Caitlin Ross. And your wards  theyre bullshit.

He didnt even bother to ask how Id known, which in turn, bothered me. He simply tapped the seat in front of him and his driver let go of the brake.

Those wards have held for six years, Miss Ross. I assure you, theyll hold.

You have no idea what youre dealing with here.

Oh, I assure you I do. There was a hard, yet sad edge to his voice that suggested  personal tragedy. I wondered if Id misjudged him after all. My apartments are only a block away. Perhaps we should speak more in my study. This isn't a conversation for anyone to overhear.

I noted the finality in his voice and, nodding, sat back in my seat. As long as I got to say what I'd come to say, I didnt care where we went. 

We were let off at the corner where several men in his personal detail were already waiting. Scott escorted me into a private entrance and private elevator with only one button marked Penthouse.

As soon as the elevator doors opened, one of his men ushered me into his cavernous study and the door was shut behind me. For whatever reason, Jameson entered from a different door a few minutes later, followed by his head bodyguard whod been at the lecture. This one didnt like me one bit, barely concealing irritation and shades of panic when he saw me. He was older, clearly over 30, with dark blonde hair and a square jaw.

Jameson sat down behind his desk while I continued to stand. He gestured to an empty seat in front of him, but I shook my head. He gave a suit yourself shrug and turned to his bodyguard, whose eyes continued to bore angry holes through me as they did everything else he looked at. This was quickly becoming enemy territory.

Scotch for me, Bannock. Anything for you, Caitlin?

Ah, no thanks... I mumbled as the guard  Bannock  raked his hair back from his forehead in exasperation, I assumed at Scotts familiar use of my first name. *Im no threat to your boss, buddy, if anything he is a threat to everyone else.*

I returned his icy glare, never wavering until his lips grew into a thin line and he curtly nodded to Jameson and left the room.

First, Scott begin, I want to establish-

Do you have any idea what youre doing? I asked, suspending all platitudes.

Jameson leaned back cautiously in his chair, giving me a casual go-on gesture.

Why would you bring that thing to a populated city? Why would you put it on display for all to see and touch? What sort of arrogance allows you to think that you could control it with a few poorly copied sigils?

He had made no move during my short outburst other than to tent his fingers and stroke his jaw with his thumb.

Which question would you like me to answer first?

Just then the one called Bannock opened the door with a little too much force and brought his great lord and master a scotch. He turned to stand beside Jamesons desk, which seemed a natural and familiar spot for him.

You may go, Eric. Jameson clipped without so much as looking at him. The guard didnt move and I continued to stare daggers at him. We engaged in our own little personal, silent standoff. He, like the statue, had eyes only for me, and they were filled with rage and fire.

He can stay, I ground out, finally. Let him know I'm not afraid of him. If he was grateful for my help, he didnt show it.

As you wish. Your question?

I slid my eyes reluctantly back to Jameson. How did you get it?

I bought it from the government.

The government had it? I asked, incredulously.

The state of Pennsylvania. It appeared on government land, in the middle of nowhere, according to the surveyor who found it. They shipped it off to PSU who dated and appraised it and then they put it up for auction.

They just *sold* it to the highest bidder?

Yes and why not? Its just a piece of granite to them and they needed the money. The state of Pennsylvania is suffering its own financial crisis. Though I suppose thats what happens when in essence 20% of the state just stops paying their taxes. Its a curious thing.

I winced. He didnt need to elaborate.

Why did you buy it? I demanded.

Because I have personal history with Metaraxes. He has taken from me.

Hes taken from me, too, but I'm not parading him around in public, risking peoples lives, their *souls* according to you.

If you listened to my lecture, you would know why I do that.

I remained silent. Jameson sighed and leaned forward.

Youre right, Caitlin. The wards wont hold him, not forever, and we don't know what will. The only reason theyre holding now is because Im *giving* him what he wants.

I scoffed. You assume that being exhibited in a museum satisfies the creatures desire for worship? And you're willing to stake people's lives on that?

"I am. That creature has not moved a millimeter since he came into my care. I've employed teams of symboligists and demonologists to research, test and advise me on the safest course of action. And for our efforts, the statue has remained dormant."

"Yes, but it's not dead. You're going to kill someone, someday."

Jameson sprung up from his desk and was in front of me before I even had a chance to take a step back. His bodyguard took an almost involuntary step toward him but it was too late. Jameson was only inches from me and much more intimidating at eye level. Bannock seemed uneasy and ready to pounce if I tried anything. I didnt.

What would you have me do, Caitlin? Would you like to take custody of it? What would you do with it? Tell me, and I'll consider it."

Destroy it! 

He gave a sad, desperate bark of laughter. Dont you think I tried that? Dont you think the first thing I did when I acquired it was try to kill it? I tried to incinerate it, hit it with a wrecking ball, I even ran it over with a tank. It wont be destroyed by any tools of man. And, believe me, Caitlin, I paid dearly for my attempts,  almost everything I love is gone."

"Then I'd put it back where it came from." If the church was even still there and *if* I could find it.

"No one can do that." He laughed.

"Who did it kill? Who that you loved?" I don't know why I cared so much, but I couldn't let it go. I had to know.

Scott took a step back but held his ground. 

"She was...she..." He trailed off.

And just how did you escape the creature when it came for *you*? 

This question hit him physically,  like a bullet. He leaned back against the desk,  suddenly weaker, defeated and less imposing. Bannock visibly relaxed, his hand sliding off the handle of the gun I hadnt noticed was still holstered in his belt.

That is a story for another time.

"Fine. But I wasnt backing down.  Then why you? Why are you the person who is qualified to own the statue?

Because I've seen it's face. My fate is bound to it as surely as yours.

Jameson Scott rubbed his face in genuine exhaustion. If he hadn't been speaking the truth, than he was a damn good actor. He looked up at me, finally, from hooded eyes that burned with some intense, unnamed emotion.

"And who did it take from you?"

"Jamie." I had nothing to hide and I wouldn't disrespect Jamie by hiding the truth. I raised my chin a little higher and crossed my arms. Scott's expression had turned milder, almost pensive and a sad smile graced his handsome face. The tension in the room abated, though Bannock was looking at me intently, his expression unchanged since the moment he'd walked into the room. 

When Scott didn't reply, I decided it was now or never.

I want to see it.

No," he replied, quietly.

Alone.

No! This time both Jameson and Bannock had spoken at the same time. I'd known he wouldnt let me go - hed never let me near the statue again. Id assumed this before I'd even met him, which is why Id swiped the museum keycard off his desk as soon as Id had the opportunity.

Why not? I asked him, anyway.

Because he knows you.

And you know he could break the wards if he wanted to.

No, he could never get past the wards. They are perfectly drawn and blessed as they should be. But I wont risk your life. Jameson Scott suddenly seemed battle-weary, so much older than his 25 years.

Dont even try it, Caitlin,  he will take you if you do, and the only one who will ever remember you...is me. His plea was multilayered, intricately woven with threads of both deceit and familiarity. Once again, I was put ill at ease. There was only one more thing I wanted from this room.

Who did it take from you and how?  Tell me that and Ill leave Lannenburg in the morning and never come back. It was lie, but I was curious.

Jamesons eyes shifted to mine, perhaps to gauge if I meant what I said. He must have believed me, because his gaze drifted to the window and he answered my question.

I took her from myself. It was an unsatisfying answer.

Now leave, commanded his bodyguard before Id had a chance to reply. Jameson stared at me as I took a step back from the desk. His eyes were again pregnant with an emotion I couldnt name, but it tread a line between longing and insanity.  Perhaps desperate desire, perhaps insane desperation. Perhaps something in between.

I will walk her out. Bannock bit as I made my escape out the door. *God, anyone but him.*

No, I need you here, Andrews will see her out. The door closed behind me and I heard no more.

Andrews turned out to be an older man with a bald head and a white beard. He met me at the elevator and escorted me all the way to the ground floor, saying little.

Do you need a ride somewhere? He asked as we stepped out into the street.

No, I can walk. He said no more, just turned around and let the private door shut behind him.  Nice of him to ask, at least.

As I walked back to the museum, I had time to wonder just what in the hell I was doing. Why didn't I listen to Scott and just leave? What did I hope to gain by seeing that thing again? Couldnt I just trust that he seemed to have everything under control? Scott had the resources, the money, the people, and, most importantly, the motivation. He had lost someone too, after all, someone he loved, though how that had come to pass was not clear. 

But I knew I had to see it again. Perhaps I could prove to him just how dangerous that thing was, regardless of the precautions he was taking. I needed to convince him to take the statue off display before more people died. It was madness, having it here. He was exposing innocent people, to a *demon* on a reckless gamble. If I could make the statue move just an inch or two, maybe even a turn of it's head, it was be on the museum security tapes and I could prove the thing wasn't truly dormant. I read him as a pragmatic, reasonable man - he would remove the exhibit at once. I trusted that much, didn't I? 

Once again I pulled up Jameson Scotts Wikipedia page. All I knew was that he was  a pioneer in the tech industry, rich as a Rothschild and interested in 14th century Judeo-Christian artifacts. It didnt fit. It just didnt. ...unless Jameson Scott was telling the truth.

But even if he being honest about his past, Scott was still lying to me about something. Like everything else in the last week, I would have to trust my gut.

I arrived at the museum and walked around the giant building looking for the gift shop. At that moment I knew two things: the statues room was next to the gift shop  and museums usually had nighttime security.

I slid Jamesons card through the reader next to the door and a light flashed green while the door emitted a soft click. I pushed it open and peered into the empty giftshop. Dim overheard lights gave the room an eerie and foreboding glow. 

The room reminded me of another room from over ten years ago, a nave, darkened by dirty windows and a muted, setting sun. I was younger then, more innocent, and Id had Jamie then.

What I wouldn't give to have him with me, now.  What would he say? Would he trust Scott? Would he attempt to stir the creature for the greater good? Or would he say I was stupid for risking my life? Jameson was convinced the wards would hold. Would Jamie have been, too?

Whatever happened, I hope I didnt fail him.

 I'm working on it right now. 




 Too soon 




 I have all the information you've requested as I've recently returned from a trip there. Update soon. 




 I would bet on it!  




 If you want Batman, get it now. It seems to be the hot item. 




 I wonder what this means for the Sunday Hall H line.

 Actually, [trial by combat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_combat) predates Game of Thrones and has real world historical origins.

Also, the above user was making a Hunger Games reference.  




 My baby goat broke it's neck and I was 18 and home alone and had to put her down myself. It was the most awful thing I've ever done and it haunts me to this day.  




 I you ever feel bad about yourself, just remember that if you were a fictional character people would love you for all the flaws, quirks and mannerisms that you hate. 




 It sounds like no one is currently living there (rusted spoon, perfectly laid out sleeping bags). So there are either bodies for OP to find or something just as bad. 

Keep us updated on the story, this is getting good. 




 Thank you! 




 That was excellent. And mentally scarring. 




 Is this a series?

If not, did the previous owners seal themselves inside a concrete tomb? To what end? 

It more sounds to me like they wanted the (tomb? shelter?) sealed tight so they had a shitty carport that "looked out of place" built over it. 

Explain if I'm wrong, I may have the dumb. 




 Dude... That ending was nauseating yet satisfying.  




 Like /u/wdalphin said, read other stories! Sometimes you'll think of a way better ending to something you're reading and just build from there. 




 There's nothing for it, you just have to write it and post it. Trust me, I know how unnerving it is which is why I only post about half of what I actually write. But you just gotta do it, son.

 




 I wish I could think of something this awesome to get for my dad.

 I heard a kid went blind once from soap poisoning.  




 I think the title has more to do with it than most people realize. When I post I try to pick something short yet provocative. 

 




 I live in Phoenix and this happens a few times every summer. It's heartbreaking.  




 A+
