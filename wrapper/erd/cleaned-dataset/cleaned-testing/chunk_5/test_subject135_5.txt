The original Christians were Jews, full stop. 




 While what the hotel did was really wrong, suing is a bit over the top. They should give him an apology, a refund, and a free stay at the hotel for a week. 




 Hitchhiker's. Because it's short, sweet, and almost always on point. 

Discworld has been going on for so long that at this point there are more books that I didn't like than I did like. 




 We've moved my office a bunch of times. The movers were all Irish. From Ireland. 




 Everything that's been said already is correct, but colonel is an exceptionally strange case.

1540s, coronell, from Middle French coronel (16c.), modified by dissimilation from Italian colonnella "commander of a column of soldiers at the head of a regiment," from compagna colonella "little column company," from Latin columna "pillar" (see column). English spelling modified 1580s in learned writing to conform with the Italian form (via translations of Italian military manuals), and pronunciations with "r" and "l" coexisted 17c.-18c., but the earlier pronunciation prevailed. Spanish coronel, from Italian, shows a similar evolution by dissimilation.

 I can't think of a single series I've been glad to have finished. Wheel of Time, Dark Tower, Harry Potter, regretted them one and all. Even Hitchhikers got progressively worse and I certainly regret bothering with the books that Douglas Adams didn't write.

Asian-American friends.  




 I don't know what goes through their minds, never having done it, but I'd rather someone speak up and then have to apologize if they've made a mistake rather than letting people getting away with taken parking space they're not entitled to. 




 Yeah! Nobody should ever stand up for anybody else's rights. Nobody should ever stand up to assholes or bullies. I can't imagine what goes through anybody's mind when they try to help people. It's ridiculous. 




 I don't know where you live but I literally went card shopping three hours ago and hardly any of them have ribbons or bows. 

And if some of them do, it's just a style fad. The way some cards have audio cards inside and play a song or a sound when you open them. Or the way some of them pop up. Or the way some of the are like three feet tall. It doesn't have any particular significance. 




 Technically both phrases mean both things.

This seems like a good explanation for why one means spouse and the other means parent.

 You're asking two different questions. Your body knows when you've had enough water because the cells that need the water are filled, and your thirst goes away.

But what inhibits you from drinking more? Nothing. You can drink water until you die and nothing in your body will physically stop you from doing it.  




 Nobody owns the rights to Bible stories so they can make Moses whatever race they want. The same goes for historical events. Nobody owns history. 

As for anime, Asians don't care about racism the way Americans do; they couldn't care less what race of actor you cast in the adaptations. 




 If you have a market-rate apartment (not rent stabilized or rent controlled), they can increase the rent however much they want. There are no legal restrictions. 

But it's not arbitrary. They need to balance making a profit against the likelihood that someone will pay the increased rent. If they raise it too high above other comparable apartments in the area, you might move and nobody else will rent it. If they raise it too little, they won't feel they're making enough money. 

Most likely they will raise it $100 a month or thereabouts. 




 A Noahide is allowed, but not required or obligated, to mark the significance of the  Seventh Day in some ways.

http://asknoah.org/essay/the-seventh-day

So if they don't observe it they're not really missing anything they're obligated to do.  









  For the religious Jews, their calendar is the right one, and everyone else is observing the wrong holy day.

Not true. Non-Jews have no obligation to observe Saturday or any other day as the Sabbath. If they follow a religion with a different Sabbath day, there's nothing wrong with that. 

Here's how Christianity's Sunday Sabbath developed:

 Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender, men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component).

 Fifty Shades of Grey is the only "spin-off" of Twilight that I can think of  that has been especially successful. And it didn't do it by mimicking Twilight the way Charlie Bone mimicked Harry Potter. So no, I didn't respond to the wrong comment. I disagreed that the reason why Charlie Bone wasn't successful and Harry Potter was had anything to do with the series growing as its audience did. 




 It helps, but I didn't think it's the worst thing in the world if you don't. Even though they do sometimes reference things that happened in previous books, they're not strictly a continuing story so it's not hard to follow along. 




 Charlie Bone was too similar to Harry Potter, that's why it didn't take off. 50 Shades of Grey is extremely different from Twilight.

Name five. I can't think of any off the top of my head.  




 As was already pointed out, SparkNotes and the like already exist. It is perfectly legal. 




 It definitely doesn't need decorations. Chairs are a good idea though since you'll probably have women in heels and older people who would appreciate being able to sit down. 




 There is no doubt that cops are better than they were, say, 50 years ago, it's just getting more attention now. The Rodney King incident happened 24 years ago; the Watts riots were incited by a police brutality incident 50 years ago.

In "the olden days" people were better at covering things up, that's all.

 today I read a fact that the mental condition and stress levels of teenagers is close to that of mental patients in the 1950s.

This is a widely misused quote/statistic. It was originally reported in the 1980s, then a meta-analysis was done in 2000 about studies done through 1993. I can't find anything more recent. But even if anxiety has only gone up since 1993, it's part of a continuing trend, not something that is distinctly new about the 21st century.

The only reason why things seem more prevalent than they used to be is because of the Internet and more of a willingness to admit things like depression, especially among boys.  




 Pandora's explanation:

Free Pandora accounts permit 6 skips per hour per station, for up to 24 total skips per day across all stations. The daily skip limit helps us prevent having to pay royalties on songs that are not being heard.

Upgrading to Pandora One increases your 24-hour skip limit, but does not remove the skip limit entirely. You can learn more about Pandora One here.

A skip is considered to be a skipped song, a Thumbs-down rating, or choosing "I'm tired of this track" in the menu of the music player.

Licensing is one of the most expensive aspects of providing the service, and we must pay the full royalties for a song, even if it only plays for a few seconds.

 If you wrote them, why not? 




  One for example I found by looking at the "What's New" feed at Internet Archive - they add a few thousand new books a day, all very old and very obscure. One day I just decided to read one. No had ever reviewed it on Amazon, Goodreads or anywhere else on Google search. I was the first person in the age of the Internet to post anything about it. The last review of the book was from 1912 when it was published. 

What book was it? 




 Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. So many old/Christian terms I'd never heard of.  




 Boring or execrable writing. And forget halfway through, I'll put a book down on page one if I dislike it that much.  




 You have to link to the llama post directly, otherwise it'll be gone and nobody's going to scroll through a Tumblr blog just to find the post you're talking about.

That said, is it his llama? Do you think he might lend it to someone for a few hours? Asking for a friend.  




 Depends on the person. 




  I never knew that there were romance novels from the male perspective. 

Me either. The only thing I can think of that comes close is lad lit, the male version of chick lit.

Though last week I read Graveyard of Memories by Barry Eisler (a thriller) and there was a romance in it from a male point of view. It was just as unrealistic as any romance from a woman's point of view.  




 Never up until now. I'm planning on reading the Hobbit and there are so many editions. The problem is that Tolkien actually revised the book after it was published and I want to read the last revision, but the book descriptions don't always make it clear which version the printing is of.  




 They are just sluts. No need for any qualifications. That's why I have no problem with this word. It's a behavior men and women engage in and both can be described that way and both are disgusting. 

I finished the Unbearable Lightness of Being this week and the main character admitted to sleeping with over 200 women. He is a slut, period. That's not a D I'd want to go anywhere near. 




 Would you rather have an ice cream scooped out with a clean ice cream scooper or one that was used on every other flavor and never washed?  




 Caleb Carr has written a number of books.

I just finished the River of Souls by Robert McCammon today. I basically had to force myself to read it and I really wish I hadn't bothered -- it didn't pay off in any way in the end. It felt like a bridge book to the next one and the writing was so dull.  




 So you mean "what book you discovered by accident." And yet, even when I'm looking for new books to read, anything I come across can arguably be called "by accident" since I wasn't specifically searching for *that* book. You can't search for a book that you don't know exists. 




 I thought it was a great book, best one they "forced" me to read in high school.  




 For example, you can't say that a person watches movies well. That just doesn't make sense. (Which isn't the same as saying they have bad taste in the movies.)

 We have plenty of machines that can listen to a person's heart or lungs. But that's the problem -- they're machines. They're not cheap or fast or portable. Stethoscopes are basically perfectly suited for their purpose. 




 The book itself is about 80 pages, so if an edition is longer, it means there's an introduction and other helpful material. But those both look like crappy editions. Get a copy from a reputable publisher like Penguin or Dover.  




 They don't care about other people's babies, only their own. 




 Right. How doesn't this have more upvotes? Being anti-vax is predicated on the deeply delusional belief that their child will be fine no matter what. Every anti-vax parent whose kid got sick with something they should have been vaccinated against very quickly does a complete u-turn on the subject. 




 That's physically impossible. If the cable network is out, your phone is not connected to anything. You're talking about a local power outage only. 




 A real landline is useful in emergencies when the power goes out. 

ITT: People who think a phone bundled with their cable is a landline. It's not. When the Internet (or power) goes out, so does the phone. 




 Nobody's perfect. But I'm not seeing how saying al hamichya is in any way analogous to having sex.  




 You're one person. I was once on a program on a kibbutz for a few weeks. The shul was literally right there, the weather was beautiful (in other words, no good excuses for not going). By the end of the program, out of 20 people, only two were still going to shacharit. So you're one of the two. But the other 18 are the normal ones. 




 Only if you're in kollel. Otherwise, just having to get early to get to minyan before work is a heroic feat. 




 Nobody's perfect, but remembering to say al hamichya is hardly impressive. A better example might be going to minyan three times a day every day. If you do that, that's impressive. 




  Are all singles "equal" (for lack of a better word)?

For this particular conversation: Yes.

What I mean is, does a divorced woman have the same status as a single woman? 

See above. 




 Yes, that's the halachic ideal, so is saying al hamicha after eating some oreos. And how many times have you done that?

Every time? I don't understand this point.  




 Again, my point was that some wigs make the wearer look overly attractive

You are absolutely correct and even some rabbis that allow wigs frown on or speak out against these overly sexy creations. Looking good is perfectly tznius; looking sexy isn't. Looking sexy is absolutely forbidden.  




 The Outsiders (S. E. Hinton). I watched the movie once when I was a teen and once when I was older, thinking a little distance from the book would make me not hate it, but nope, still thought it was terrible. 




 Too long, overhyped. 




 Thanks, but how is being crucified defeating the dark lord of the underworld? Isn't that he died for people's sins? (Not a Christian, not overly familiar with the NT or Christian theology.) 




 Where is that in the Bible? New Testament? 




 Or Wizard's Hall by Jane Yolen. Interesting that the Books of Magic and Wizard's Hall came out within a year of each other. Clearly this was an idea that was percolating and Rowling caught the bug too, only it took her seven more years to put her book out.

In 1991, the author Jane Yolen released a book called Wizard's Hall, to which the Harry Potter series bears a resemblance. The main protagonist, Henry (also called Thornmallow), is a young boy who joins a magical school for young wizards.[74] At the school "he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard."[75] However, Yolen has stated that "I'm pretty sure she never read my book," attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes.[76] In an interview with the magazine Newsweek, Yolen said, "I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to cut me a very large check, I would cash it."[77] Yolen stopped reading Harry Potter after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of Harry Potter, calling it "fantasy fast food".[77][78]

 Something you might keep in mind that lately there's been a huge backlash against creative writing courses, particularly MFA degrees. I don't remember their exact argument, but it's easy enough to Google. 




 I certainly didn't understand the difference at that age.

Were you were even taught the difference? Nowadays they have "bad touch" lectures in schools. When I was a kid we didn't. We got the rape lectures in high school but child abuse was a taboo topic. 




 I think children of capable of understanding the concept of "bad touch" versus "I find this really annoying but I'm willing to put up with it because old person." 

I saw your comment below in the thread and at least where I'm from, boys are much more likely to get their cheeks pinched than girls. It's a different dynamic than you (and possibly) OP is describing. So if the touching comes off as creepy it would be better to tell to stop, but pinching, while not fun, is clearly harmless.  




 Would you be interested in a critique of the entire novel? 




 I once took a creative writing course (adult ed, not college) and I found it completely unhelpful. Each week we focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g., character, plot, description) and we had to read a short story that illustrated this technique, write a little in class and do a homework assignment. Maybe because one week per technique wasn't enough or maybe because I'm not the kind of person who can produce a story on demand, but I felt this was completely unhelpful.

Though I did eventually develop a story idea that has a ton of potential and I've been writing about it ever since, so at least I had that going for me.  




 That I lived with my parents. Too embarrassing. (Thankfully it's not the case anymore.) 









 It doesn't just taste bad, it smells bad too. 




 It depends what sort of community you live in. Where I live, this is very typical old-person behavior. And actually, it's worse than touching or patting, it's usually cheek-pinching, and kids hate it. But at the same time, I do feel like it's the sort of thing you just have to put up with.  




 Thanks, putting it on my list! 




 This is completely untrue. Popcorn is actually quite healthy and has tons of nutritional value. It is an excellent snack.

And the facts speak for themselves: a single portion of popcorn contains more antioxidants than all the fruit and veg most people eat in a day, as noted in a study by Scranton University. Antioxidants keep molecules harmful to cells in check, and are present in many fresh fruits and vegetables. Popcorn also has a large amount of vitamins; folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamins B, A, E, and K, as well as being a source of iron, potassium, zinc, and polyphenols which contain the antioxidants to fight off cancers and cardiovascular health problems.

 This article is a mess. 

The reason why relationships can't be based on explicit exchange is because hardly anybody can handle the truth about themselves or anybody else. Not too many people are going to be honest about their failings as a friend or partner, and in any event, most people are willing to put up with their loved one's failings even to the extent that they put up with abusers.

But it's also because in every relationship, there's always somebody who loves/gives/does more and somebody who loves/gives/does less because there are no two people who are exactly alike and are in exactly the same circumstances. 




 Books similar to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series? 




  4 wisdom tooth. 4. Can't be taken out because they are mostly horizontal.

Why does their being horizontal mean that they can't be taken out? 




 Different reasons. 

Fat doesn't conduct heat well, so while it does insulate your body, it feels colder to the touch. So wherever you have larger fat stores, those parts will feel colder. 

Another thing is that your hands and feet are more likely to have poorer blood circulation than the rest of your body so they're more likely to feel cold.  




 How would you know these sounds are happening in real life unless they're waking you up? That means that at the time they're happening, you're actually minimally awake and shaking off the dream you just had and it feels like the sounds are part of the dream, but really you're just hearing them IRL. 




 There were tons of crappy books being published one hundred years ago. You're confusing 1908 with 1708.  




 While theoretically I agree with you, practically speaking, have you ever read Rowell? I had such high hopes for Fangirl and was sorely disappointed.

I'm not sure what world you live in that anyone has ever lauded him as a great writer. Ever. 




 Read Ender's Shadow instead. So much better than Ender's Game. 




 That's what I did with Wheel of Time. So what I did was read two pages per day and took over a year to finish each book. That way I didn't really waste any precious time on it, but still finished it. Regretted starting the series in the first place, but didn't entirely regret finishing it. 




 Yeah, so this map is interesting but not entirely accurate, since there's a third category.

 Death and the Flower by Koji Suzuki. I've liked his horror novels and figured even though it wasn't horror, I'd probably like this too. Nope. Couldn't get through it.  




 Generally speaking, it's because your parents are supposed to be teaching you life skills, while school is supposed to be teaching you academic subjects so you can be a knowledgeable person and as preparation for a future job.

 Why do the 2/3 go under the B/D/E while the 1 goes over them? It makes it looks like there's some significance to that, but there isn't.  









 I know a couple just like this and my sense is that the wife doesn't really care about their finances because she doesn't think they'll ever really need that much money, like a downpayment for a house, and she's really too young to begin to understand the concept of retirement, so she figures, so what if we live paycheck to paycheck and enjoy ourselves, life is going to be like this forever.

It might be helpful to sit down and work out what your long-term goals are, including buying a house, paying for your kids' college education, and having a decent income in retirement. Then maybe she'll understand why saving is a lot more important than she realizes. 




 Seriously? I feel like there's been a massive change from 2000 to now. The rise of the SJW, the fact that everybody on the Internet is stealing from everybody else, the massive amounts of pessimism about the future, etc.

 You really think that anybody who named their kid Isidore had any idea what it meant? Though it is an interesting question how such an ugly name like Isidore became popular. Similarly Morris, Ira, and Irving. 




  if you have rule out any name associated with a saint, that's a lot of names. 

Yes, that's right. Traditionally Jews gave their children Hebrew names and then at some point they added Yiddish names, which tended to be translations of the Hebrew name. Like Tzipporah-Feigie, which both mean bird. And then when English names came around, they tended to give English translations of the Hebrew names like Rivka-Rebecca. 

I've known Jewish people with Gaelic names and all kinds of European names, so it's odd that Nicholas specifically would be off the table.

Nicholas isn't off the table. Like I said, if you eat ham and cheese, it really doesn't matter that much what you name your kids.  




 I have a couple of friends who have Fridays off for different reasons and the way it works is that Thursday night is for shopping and Friday is for preparing for the Sabbath. They never use those times for leisure activities. (One is single and the other is married with children, so you can't even say that it's the fault of their situations. Their situations could not be more different.) 

If I were offered the option of having off on Friday but not Sunday, I would not take the offer.

And for secular people, they'd adjust to having Sunday off instead of Friday pretty easily. Considering that hundreds of millions of people around the world have off on Sunday, it's not like this is some kind of impossible thing to deal with.  




 Since you posted this 18 hours ago, I'm going to assume you're not a Sabbath-observer. As a Sabbath-observer, having Friday off does not make more sense. While it's nice to be able to have the whole day to prepare for the Sabbath, that's exactly the problem. The only thing you can do (especially in the winter) is have time to prepare for the Sabbath. So if you want to go to the beach in the summer or hang out with some friends or go to a concert on Saturday night, you're not going to be able to do that.

Having Sunday off works better regardless of whether you're a Sabbath observer or not. 




 You should be thinking about the meaning of the prayers that you're saying. And if you can't do that, just concentrate on the words themselves and blank out your mind to all other thoughts. 




 Google "university press" and look at their websites. As a clinical psychologist, you must subscribe to journals...? Look into those...? 




 It's a name that's strongly associated with Christianity. So any Jew who really cares about being Jewish and transmitting the tradition to the next generation would not give their child that name. Anybody who's a ham-and-cheese Jew will do whatever they want.

From the Greek name  (Nikolaos) which meant "victory of the people" from Greek  (nike) "victory" and  (laos) "people". Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Anatolia who, according to legend, saved the daughters of a poor man from lives of prostitution. He is the patron saint of children, sailors and merchants, as well as Greece and Russia. He formed the basis for the figure known as Santa Claus (created in the 19th century from Dutch Sinterklaas), the bringer of Christmas presents.

Due to the renown of the saint, this name has been widely used in the Christian world. It has been common in England since the 12th century, though it became a bit less popular after the Protestant Reformation. The name has been borne by five popes and two czars of Russia.

 Sounds like your best bet would to try to work for an academic or general non-fiction publisher that puts out either scholarly or popular non-fiction psychology titles. With your background, it will be extremely hard to get hired as a general editor or book reviewer.

That's lucky -- I've encountered a lot of bad behavior.  




 Thanks.

Though you do realize that these are not comparable to what people are typically complain about? The slow walker. The person who suddenly stops at the top of the train steps. The person who thinks that the whole world needs to hear them going through the ring tones on their phone. The person who falls into an open manhole because they weren't paying attention, etc.
