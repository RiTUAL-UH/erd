 And that's an awesome thing. Let me get this straight. It's awesome that these were reported for Apple to fix and spend time on instead of being abused by the finders. An operating system has to harbor a huge deal of running software, so I would expect operating systems to have more bugs and vulnerabilities than anything else.

But now instead of hearing that vulnerabilities are being attacked, they are being reported and addressed. And Lettie honest. We would all rather the next big update will be closing up these holes as well as performance improvements instead of mindless additions of new features adding more bugs to the list. 




 That would be so cool if it worked the way it were supposed to. 




 That 102%. 




 Deck size according to the official rules.

The size of your main deck should be anywhere from 40 to 60. Your extra deck should be between 0 and 15 cards. Your side deck should be between 0 and 15 cards.

People who tell you it *has* to be 40 are likely just suggesting that 40 is optimal. 




 That's why he's saying it should be an *option*. I'm sorry, do you not know what that word means? 









 I might just be grasping at straws here, but I doubt my sister won't make the news like I did. For those of you who dont know, I left links to my previous posts right here:

I'll definitely give her credit. She's braver than I am. Insane actually. She's staying overnight in the hospital while the doctors tend to her stab wonds. Just inches away from the heart.

She found my bookmark while I was away at therapy. Im doing much better by the way, thanks for wondering. It was yesterday at therapy she invaded my bookmarks and found it. She could see it clear as day. At least according to her. When I try to see it again, I get another 404 error message. As if the page isn't found or doesn't want to be. Or it's pretending to be hidden. Here's the bookmark link I told you about:

cipherthecipherfor.schl.com/hotline/cipher#underground.

Go ahead, try it yourself. I wouldn't recommend it to be brutally honest.

Early this morning, she told me at the hospital how happy she was feeling to know people cared. When I asked her to go on, she shifted to a story about her friend who had hung herself last Thanksgiving.

She was convinced by the cipher that she could reach her dead friend with the cipher. Then, a bit more quickly than I was, she was convinced that suicide was the path to her friend. As she stabbed herself, she supposedly thought of the wound as a reunion wound. Sound cheesy? It's my little sister. I don't understand half of the things that come out of her.

I cant imagine how she and I could have such poor judgment. The human mind is a sick thing, and some great minds may think alike, but it almost seems like a coinsidence. I deleted that bookmark and even deleted my entire browser history to make sure I never find this cipher again. At least not on accident. I already regret leaving it here.

Although, I do feel a thirst to know a bit more. But, I'm hoping it will all work out in therapy. 




 Yeah. I do. Funny you should reply today. I was about to post an update. 









 Imagine having hype even though there were only 14 characters. It was still rather awesome. The game feels so much better compared to then. 




 Well, who made these entitled jerks the title police?

I mod and made subs with only 900 subscribers that regularly get posts to reach 25-30 upvotes. Proportionally, that's just sad. 




 There's nothing wrong with posting it here. You should be allowed to edit the vine and clip or delete different shots of it. I'm not sure how. Haven't used to app to actually upload anything that needed editing in weeks. 




 Returning to their roots? Lol. This sounds cool. 




 It wasn't really a depression. It was more like a sudden impulse that took over my life. And now the results just won't let me move on. Everyone's afraid that I'll attempt suicide again if they don't keep an eye on me. The only real alone time I get is practically when I shower. 




 Well, this is a strange question to answer. Japanese cards are for the OCG, while most other languages are part of the TCG. Now, you may use foreign cards as long as you have a separate copy of the card (outside of your deck). This offers an immediate credible translation to prevent cheating or dishonesty.

However, if you're in the TCG, you CANNOT use OCG cards in your deck under any circumstances. This goes both ways. If Japanese cards were allowed in the TCG, they would probably be a lot more.

These are the rules for large sanctioned events. Your locals may handle it differently depending on a number of factors. I would first ask your judges, then make sure any opponents you face don't mind. But, always have an English copy ready. 




 Thanks. Don't be surprised if you get something tomorrow. I have been talking with the same people for way too long. It's driving me back up a wall. 




 Holy shit. Way to go Kaspersky. 




 It's actually not mechanically impossible. Two monsters with the same attack battling doesn't ebd in 0 damage, it sends in no damage. It's a weird concept.

Think of it this way, damage has to be felt in a value. The value of 0 cannot be delt. When we say no damage, it means there technically is no value to deal to either player.

Two more interesting bits is that a direct attack if 0 atk also doesn't set a value for damage. Also, two monsters attacking with 0 atk doesn't destroy either monster. 




 ... I'm not kidding. My friends actually believe Nintendo bought P:M. 




 There's a rumor in my small community that Nintendo bought Project M and is halting its development and that no new versions will ever come out. How the hell did this rumor happen? I immediately checked here and on the game's page and found nothing hinting that it was true.

I even had one guy tell me since no new versions were coming that he wanted his money back (that was used to buy a flash drive and SD card, I didn't sell him P:M) because no new versions were coming out.

Where the hell could this rumor be coming from? 




  "When I first showed off the new Zelda game on the Wii U, it seemed everyone was very excited and started proclaiming that a Zelda game had at last become open world! Zelda games have always allowed you to roam and explore a huge world.

 "What's changed now is that the hardware has progressed to the point that you can now explore this vast world seamlessly; the underpinning of the game hasn't changed."

I can't wait for people to misinterpret this and say stuff like, "Oh, that means we're not getting the game we wanted. We're getting the same shitty linear game from last time." 




 Gerudo Desert in TP didn't have a lot in it. And never a lot of things at the same time. 




 Hair cleaner is sort of the same way. Most of this "cleaner" shit that promises better looking skin or hair is actually mostly comprised of stuff that can't actually do anything for us. 




 I really wish "leaks" would finally just be seen as a fucking joke on the internet. Isn't there anyone else who never takes a leak seriously? 




 Okay. Just making sure I understood!

Thanks  




 Have you ever heard of a slow news day? I attempted suicide and told the story a few days ago, there's the link to it in case you want to read about that.

http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/

Now my local news station is hooked on my suicide attempt. Local channels have been buzzing the feed with how I starved for twelve days. How will people treat me when I leave my house? Will they see me the same? In one hand, I hold anticipation of the pity and uplifting comments I might get. The other simply holds dread for the ones that will look at me differently. As if I'm a freak that don't belong.

But I sort of feel that way. The last thing I need is for people to treat me like a complete satanist. If you couldn't tell, the town is highly superstitious. It makes me more than just glad that they didn't tell the town my reasoning for attempting. I faked the answer anyway. The real reason would sound absurd to them.

My chosen method of deteriorating my inner being was supposedly the biggest reason they are covering this. Supposedly nobody else tries to starve themselves to death. Please, do not call me asking if you can order me a pizza.

My friends are throwing an "alive party" for me next weekend. Kind of can't wait for that. Then again, I sort of don't want to go. I dread the possible mockery and a huge buffet of food being shoved down my throat through a funnel.

My therapist is calling me every four hours to make sure I have something to eat. My parents have been cooking every day now. Sure, eating sodium noodles is better than nothing, but I almost died of starvation. They don't want me dying from what I eat. How ironic that would be. Am I using that word right?

So I started looking at that cipher again. Yeah, I wouldn't be posting here if this wasn't about something weird going on. Let me correct myself. I tried looking at the cipher. The url I found it out doesn't work anymore. It worked the entire time I was suicidal. Can anyone else see if it works? Just as a warning, if you're afraid of the stranger parts of the web, I wouldn't want you to look.

cipherthecipherfor.schl.com/hotline/cipher#underground.

I took it straight from my bookmarks, so It should be correct. I even tried adding http://www. before it.

I'm just wondering if its just me of it its being taken down. 




 dank? 




 I don't doubt it. I have a friend with an LG TV. Probably the sexiest definition I've ever seen. 




 1. Make good vines. Don't skimp out on the production quality. There are many tiny things you can do to make your vine look a little better. If you're doing a voice-over in particular, don't do it in a setting where you see black bars running up and down the screen. Get a good view of the screen and don't make it sound like you're afraid of waking people up. If someone screams, make them scream instead of a fucking little whisper scream.

  There's a particular voiceover I've watched probably more than 100 times myself.

2. Make vines that do loop. This sounds obvious, but it's actually a really good method. I've probably put in more than 40 loops in the "What's that" "Amnesia Spray" vine I saw. It's a simple loop, but it works.

3. Follow others. This sounds like a cheap tactic, but people do look into the following list of funny viners to see who they think is also funny and/or talented. And they look in the followed by list to see others that are into the same type of vines. So follow people who do vines similar to yours. Every once in a while, you can unfollow and refollow to put yourself at the top of the list for more exposure. It's not illegal, it's not hacking, and it's much more ethical than following channels that follow you just because you're following them (follow 4 follow channels).

4. If you cheat and use Vine Client or some other method of uploading edited vines, use a better camera than your phone. And learn/obtain better editing software if you can. It's simple, but it goes a long way.

5. Send your vines to your friends. Yeah, I'm serious. I have friends who skip my vines unless I tell them that I uploaded a new one. And most of the time, your friends' followers are your followers. So make sure they revine any vines that they really like from your page. 




 Well, if LG rolled with the good ideas and implemented them in their own unique and innovative way, that would be awesome. Sadly, it's less likely to happen. 




 You sound like an elitist piece of shit too. I've never fucking played the game. But I never will. I'll never fucking play a game that conditions me to want to play all day and tells me I'm not allowed to. That's pretty much the definition of shitty business practices. 




 I'm guessing Apple is tired of Samsung's shit. 




 Forgive me, but I've never heard of a game of solitaire that costs you extra money to play more than 3 times in 1 day. And solitaire decides where all cards are at the start instead of deciding what card is which as you reveal them. Yeah, solitaire is Unwinnable sometimes, but that isn't the creator's fault. That's more of a fault of the game's design that cannot be changed. But Candy Shit Does have a design than can be changed. They COULD make it so the game could detect un-winnable boards and tweak the RNG. But they don't. They would fucking love for you to get 10 unwinnable boards so you decide to pay 5 dollars to play an extra round that day. 




 And if I remember, the game market crashed once partly due to advertising and box art that were way too realistic and far beyond what the games actually looked like. People became so fucking tired of ads and box arts lying to them. 




 This is just pathetic. It's a ducking RNG puzzle that sometimes might not even spawn a winnable state. It just preys on poor pathetic loser phone owners who really have nothing better to do than be too frustrated with RN-Jesus to even care about their wallet. 




 The shape and size of the port is standardized. What's in the cord technically isn't. 




 I don't really support the micro USB being a standard thing. Not all cords are created equal. And, unfortunately, when you mix and match cords to devices, you could end up with cords that don't work any more or too much power being related to a device causing potential harm. This is likely more to do with Nintendo protecting their system. Believe it or not, I've lost electronic devices to using cords from 3rd parties or other devices. 




 How much do you want for it? 




 How much did you get that for? And how much do you want for it? 




 Luckily, I have more than 6 SD cards. So I can just install this on a spare. Wish me luck. 




 That's nice. I've been at this for since Melee. And even I haven't achieved a 100% L-cancel rate. 




 Please read the rules. 




 As supposed to Super Mario Bros where you went right and jumped over obstacles? It doesn't get much more linear than that. 




 She saved kittens. This is now my favorite good girl Gina meme. 




 The seller has informed us that you started demanding progress on the card only 12 hours after you paid. Users sending out over the weekend is a common thing. Sellers taking 1-2 days to send is also a common thing. Active traders often make as many deals as they can in those days so they can make a single trip to the post office.

If you needed your card(s) urgently, you should have made that clear beforehand and have been willing to cover for shipping.

I'm sorry, but your feedback is void. /u/hgxarcher will not be held accountable. 




 Every character already has Powershielding which provides a way to counter something providing 0 shield stun. Yeah, powershielding is rarely used and is frame perfect, but Smash is filled with rare events and frame-tight abilities.

And I'm not quick to put "gimmick" onto something. I know I get frustrated whenever any character is given something cool, everyone rushes to call it some sort of game-ruining gimmick or some sort of gimmick the character relies on. So far, I have yet to see anyone actually rely on a character's new ability.

Now, despite all of that, this mechanic looks extremely defensive and seems to encourage defensive gameplay. Part of the goal of Project M is to create a game where offensive is more favorable than defensive. I don't see how this parry being implemented across the cast would favor the game becoming a fast-based offensive game. 




 If it were true, then the scalpers win. 




 I assume either one of them got caught cheating, or one of them doesn't trust the other not to cheat. In either case. that relationship is heading to a halt. 




 Some of you will know me for the post that almost nobody could read. Here's a link in case you don't know what I'm talking about.

http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/

Don't worry, I'm not posting anything like that again. I've learned my lesson, and it drove me near to death's cold hand.

I tried starving myself to death. Alone, isolated, and hungry, I collapsed from hunger 12 days into the fast. I was absolutely prepared to die, but I woke up mere hours later in the hospital. I gave my family an extreme heart attack. They asked why I did it, and I told them the whole story.

A few weeks ago, I met a girl online. It was through her older sister. On YouTube, she left a comment on one of my videos saying it made her day and that she had been contemplating suicide as well. Two days later, she decided against it.

It wasn't just chatting with me. She liked the company she had at home which also convinced her, and it included her sister. When the girl and I were talking on Skype, she had to step away. Her little sister filled in for her. She and I shared pictures and decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend after just an hour of chatting.

She stayed on social media for as long as she could just to see if I would log on. I would go on just to talk to her. But, suddenly, she just vanished from social media. Her older sister said she had committed suicide herself. A knife through the stomach. Bled to death.

Despite telling my family all of this, I conveniently left out the part about writing a cipher and trying to reach her through a public message. Who the hell would believe that? I don't even believe she heard me anymore.

I was told all my life that people who commit suicide neither go to heaven nor hell. Somewhere different. A special limbo of unforgiving nothingness I guess. I wanted to say a proper goodbye.

I found a cipher online. If I encrypted a letter to her and posted it somewhere public, she would get the message as soon as someone could decipher it. The rules were simple. People had to see it publicly and I couldn't tell anyone is was a cipher, I couldn't tell anyone to decipher it, and I couldn't give anyone the solution. The last rule is I could only post it to one website and only once on that website.

I posted to reddit. Other sites were no good since I had no friends to see it, and they wouldn't care. And then they would know about my online relationship. The creepypasta subreddit was perfect. I would have someone decipher it and not think I was serious.

But I still wanted to see her. My poor logic clouded my better judgment. The foggy road led to one place for all suicides. All suicides lead to Rome? If I was dead, I was going to see her. That's how it worked in the way I thought about it. But I'm not brave enough to plunge a knife through my heart or jump off a building.

And now my memory of the cipher feels fuzzy. Everytime I think about it, I seem to remember it less, and it causes me to feel desperate to see her. Ill be in therapy for a while to get over this. This bottle inside me needed to be open. 









 That's what you get when you try to upscale from 240p to 5k. 




 Unless it was your unmarried virgin uncle. 




 Jigglypuff. They never took puff seriously until I started playing with her. Heck, I even have a few friends that still don't take her seriously and just think I'm showing off by winning with a "trash character". The more they practice, the more they get frustrated that they somehow cannot beat me even when I use what they think is a bad character.

It kind of helps that one of them is so predictable, I can always call when he's about to dash attack. 




 Hazy Flame Ghostrick Frogs 




 Why? to announce another fetch-quest filled free-world RPG? 




 All is fair in love and war. And this is a competition between those who are accepted to compete. And if you bring the best deck, are the best player, and played the best that day, then you haven't done anything unfair.

If you'd really like to make some of them feel better, just help them when they ask for it. Give advice, hand out some cards you don't want/need, and just get along with them all around.

If my locals was full of shit players, you'd bet I'd be doing this. 




 It's just regular headphones with a cheaply manufactured chip that runs sound through the equalizer. Headphones are hardware. Beats isn't. 




 Well, I knew quite a few of these. Pretty much the only one I didn't know what effect of Fire arrows on gossip stones. 




 They own beats. Which isn't a hardware technology. Beats is a proprietary equalizer setting. That's right, an equalizer setting. So, if you knew the settings it used, you could go into the equalizer of any music player and have it for free. But nobody will know because it's hidden away by dr dre. 




 They basically admitted to doing what we all thought Kinnect on Xbox one was going to do. 




 There used to be something like that implemented at /r/YGOSales. It was combined with the eBay thread. Suffice to say, the quick-trade feature was never taken advantage of. Would be doubtful that any more than you would want to take advantage of it on /r/YGOBinders. 




 Well, make it hard to get out, but easy to deal with. So let's say it was a level 5. This basically means most search cards will not be able to grab it. Not to mention it needs to be tribute summoned or special summoned by a different card's effect.

Now let's assume this card has to be balanced around the assumption that your opponent has no hand traps. What's the most born damage you see a burn player deal on the first hand. It's around 2000. But, if you assume this player will be abusing equip cards, you have to factor Mage power and United we stand which could potentially give this card about 1500 attack on the first turn on a good first hand. Or a lot more if you play lavals and rekindling. (On that note, don't make this a FIRE monster with 200 DEF.)

So if you take that 2000 and take away the 1500, I'd say it would have to have 500 or less attack. 




 I see way too many people make this mistake. If you're going to take the time to write a story or tell a story, make sure you don't give away any twists, especially the ending, in your title. You want to draw people in, not essentially tell them what's up so they can move on. You lose views and upvotes this way.

**Examples**

Title: I Live Along

The Twist: There's someone or something living with the author that he or she's afraid of.

Title: I Looked In The Mirror

The Twist: something involving a mirror world

Title: I Keep Getting Called

The Twist: The caller is someone he knows or knew from the afterlife or just someone torturing him for no good reason.

Title: This is a True Story

The Twist: It's not.

 Good. They don't deserve that money with the way they do their fucked up business. 




 That design is wrong. Go look at the file used in game. There is no line there.

 Okay, I had been trying to defend it saying that it's an easy way of getting videos monetized since it's almost impossible through Google unless you have documents proving it's your video.

But this is just leaps and bounds over that line from questionable to bullshit. 




 Last time I did on this subreddit, everyone accused me of being a dick to the community. 




 In Smash 4, that would have done 18%. Lol. 




 Throw them off a boat. 




 Mango entered a 3.5 PM tourney? Which tourney? I'd like to see that. 




 My girlfriend plays Zelda. Pretty damn good too. She spent hours just trying to get down her tricks in 3.02. And yet, she's the only one I don't see whining about her new tools. 




 Edgeguard better maybe. 




 A lot of people say it is bad for P:M because it supposedly nerfed everyone to the point that only the Melee top tiers are viable. I simply don't see it. When characters win and top multiple tournaments, there's two factors going into it. The first is how good the character actually is compared to the rest of the cast. The other is the high amount of representation that these "Melee top tiers" get just because the playstyle from Melee somewhat transfers over well. This would be true for Fox, C. Falcon... and nobody else. I can't think of another Melee top tier that I see dominating tournaments.

Think about it. Nobody really knew how good Mewtwo was in 3.02 until EmuKiller showed everyone how far Mewtwo's new design could be developed. Until then, Mewtwo was severely lacking in representation. Afterwards, Mewtwo flocked all over with Mewtwo making headway in many tournaments.

People love to cry out that the spacies and other top tiers are immune to nerfs. But if you, just for one example, f***ing read Fox's change log, his upsmash was severely reduced, likely leaving Pikachu to have the absolute best upsmash out of the Melee veterans.

But a whole lot of changes, not necessarily nerfs, were done to each character so that ONLY PEOPLE WITH IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE of the game would pull off combos above 3-4 hits. But guess what, the people who know their characters the most and in the most numbers just happen to be f***ing Melee top tiers. They already have an intimate knowledge of how their character can generally pull off combos while the rest of the cast has to play catch up with their combo game. In 3.02, there were a lot of changes to make sure that certain moves easily converted into other moves for semi-easy combos. Now, all of that work has basically been reversed along with universal standards that ended up nerfing every character.

This is the first patch where characters weren't developed in a vaccuum but all studied and tweaked until they all  met the project goal. And since that included nerfs, everyone just wants to fucking cry that Melee top tiers are good because they're immune to nerfs. But they're not immune to nerfs. They simply already fit inside a Melee environment by fitting every point of the project goal.

This isn't a game meant to make the Melee veterans suck. So forget it if that's what you're expecting (that goes for anyone). Project M 3.5 is a great patch. If you want to whine that you can no longer beat your friend who keeps playing that spacie, get the f*** over it. Get better. And to quote Isai, "Don't get hit." 




 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is Apple trying to be google? Does Apple want google's action? 




 Let's do it America. I'd totally put bacon on my money! 




 You mind posting screenshots showing the refund *and* that you told him that before he left the feedback? 




 It's be quite a bit for shipping. You cool with that? 




 Can you explain your behavior pretending you know nothing about feedback? Care to explain why we don't seem to have any request to verify your thread? You have 24 hours to respond. 




 Gasp, a brony that watches spongebob. 




 Wasn't this common for too long? Companies able to pay Adblock, and if Adblock sees that the ads don't harm or intrude on the experience in the website then Asblock would block those?

I thought this was already a thing. 




 I'm really trying to get rid of as much as possible at the same time. 




 Wait, so they have the best running back at 1 yard away. Wouldn't running it seem like the obvious choice? When it comes to trying to work around what your opponent is doing, would t passing it in seem like a clever idea? 




 I couldn't imagine every character getting this. It looks so gimmicky, and the game is already a crouch-cancelling war at low %. I do think Yoshi would be a great candidate for this, especially since it also adds air-parrying. I would love to see how that affects Yoshi as a character. 




 That sounds right up my ally. 




 And? The total value of this stuff comes out to ~$115, and I won't charge the WHOLE value of shipping. I never do. 




 Easy mode? I don't see you learning 40 matchups. 




 [Here's what's for sale](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)

Shipping would be charged AFTER I shipped and have a receipt showing how much it costs. You would only pay $80 up front. If you want, I can send 1 portion for $50, then the rest for $30 after, then we'll see how much shipping was after.

But, seriously, I need the money, and I don't need these cards anymore. 




 Wait, so you had to post this because you probably couldn't get to a computer. Yet, this is being documented and posted supposedly after you've had therapy sessions and police search through your room. You must have had access to a computer between then and now somehow. And you have a smartphone. Couldn't you have posted this with that?

Anyway, never minding the somewhat apparent logical error, I hope you figure out what's going on as safely as possible. Can you hire a private investigator? 




 Okay, let's get another point out of the way, because many users here don't seem to have a certain concept through their thick-ass skulls.

KONAMI PREFERS TO SLIM DOWN THEIR BANLIST, NOT MAKE IT BIGGER!!!

So if keeping one card banned (broken or not) allows us to keep 2 or more cards that are much more generic and less powerful completely off the banlist, KONAMI will do that.

Stratos being banned allows so many other cards to be at 3.

So combined with the fact that HEROs have enough search, your argument that "you can't summon him more than once" is shit, because you can summon him about as many ways as you can summon Deneb.

And Stratos has exceptionally high attack power for being so damn powerful in his effects. 




 If it turns out it's a text message, I would offer them an ultimatum. If they don't want to hand over their phone, they must read the last 15 messages in the conversation.

If they're receiving a call, they can put it to speaker phone so we can all hear what's too important to wait until after class, or they hand it over.

Yes, I would be the hugest dick as a teacher. 




 Because maybe some people don't like to be public or whore out for attention when they donate to charity.
