 All gnomes are double agents. 




 If you make something grand share the codepen url. 




 I've read git isn't really the best for [binary files](https://robinwinslow.co.uk/2013/06/11/dont-ever-commit-binary-files-to-git/). If you're looking for something more for backing up your work check out [extended version history](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/113) in dropbox. Other services like google drive might have something similar though I haven't looked. 




 If you're interested in animating read up on [SMIL](http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/smil-animation.html#animationNS-AnimationModel) 




 Here is some light reading for those sleepless nights http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ 









 I can see how it's misleading now thanks, I think I updated the article in a way that makes my intentions more clear. 




 A good place for me (and many designers) to start is by tinkering with the code that makes the stuff run. You can [play with the examples in the article on codepen](http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/OPpbbR) without making an account or spending time setting up a dev environment.
 




 Yeah view it here: http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/OPpbbR

Ironically enough, the medium.com publishing platform doesn't support .svg files at this time (or embedding codepens), the animation at the top is actually a gif :) 














 What are your pros and cons with polymer so far? I've been anticipating playing with it. 



















 The way I learned how to do it was by drawing curved shapes in a vector drawing program (sketch, illustrator etc) and exporting to SVG to take the code apart. 

After that I began reading the w3 spec recencyeffect posted to learn all the hidden goodies.  




 It's for a section in a larger piece for a web based project. The entire piece will be [animated](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html) in code.  I never thought I would do pixel art in a vector program until recently, though I believe hexels is vector based but I haven't used it in a while.  




 I suppose I formed a bad habit early and never thought to do it any differently. I'm glad I finally took the time though :) 




 What is the most frustrating thing about working with IE8? 




 I have never had a reason to use more than one background image until now. I fear there are thousands of small things like this I'll never have a need to know. 









 Thanks my secret is proper hydration. 




 Thanks, I updated the markdown title. 









 Thanks for this, I may try something similar for a star twinkle animation and it's useful to have samples to reference. 




     $img-path: "../../img/";
 
    body {
      background: url(#{$img-path}astronaut-ryan.svg) no-repeat fixed 0 0;
    } 









 Trade Dev time for whichever current hobby consumes the most of your time. If you play video games for a few hours everynight try spending that time on your portfolio during the week and "cheating" on the weekends when you can resume the hobby for a nice break.  




 You just blew my mind as well. 









 Wow, that's amazing. I have a lot of polishing left to do on my current animations apparently. 




 Maybe try making the gradient greyscale and then applying a lumosity blending mode to it http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/transparency-blending-modes.html#about_blending_modes 




 Think of it as the opportunity to do an art project in a week. Make a website advertising your favorite super hero's services. 




 I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you want advice on how to create more things for a portfolio? So you want critiques on what you've already done?
