Hi, Addy. Its Caleb. Ive got more information about that thing you were asking about. Hey, did you know that if you want to out-drive a tornado, you just have to drive 70 miles per hour? I know, its so interesting. I am a [well](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/) of useless knowledge. Oh, before I go, I was wondering what youre doing Friday. The roommates and I want to break in the new place with a party. I dont know if youll be in town around then, so just- [BEEEP].

Hey man, just thought Id check up on you. Its Caleb. You never responded to my last message - I dont know if your phones being a dick or youve just been too busy, but yeah. A bunch of people at the party said they hadnt heard from you for a long time. Amanda said she stopped by your place but you didnt answer the door and your car was gone. Is everything okay? Get back to me whenever.

Addy, where are you? Its been a few months. Jason and the rest of the crew said they were worried. Although, they could just be trying to get me off your trail. Seriously, though, if youre really trying to avoid me for whatever reason, Ill stop calling after this. I just want to make sure everythings okay. Ill be in Laughlin for the next week, so I wont be around my phone a whole lot. Just let me know. Im sor- [BEEEP]

I came into town today and saw your missing poster. They chose a nice picture, but it wasnt one you liked. Something you were tagged in a while back. [] I dont know why Im still leaving messages. It sort of makes me feel like theres still a chance youre alive. I miss you. Come back.
