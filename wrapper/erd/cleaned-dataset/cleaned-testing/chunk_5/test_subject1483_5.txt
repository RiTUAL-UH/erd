 And I'm just sitting here with a 16MB connection. Asshole. 




 So how is this fallout series?? Any good as the hype?? Never played any of them. 




 And it's about time too! I thought dragons were way bigger. 




 Why don't you call yourself a Glartist? 




 Seriously whats the point?? I really do not get it. The point of digital is not having to go to the shop. If I go to the shop I'll buy the disc since you know it actually gives you something to show for it. 




 You're paying for the internet anyway, a few free loaders won't magically make it more expensive. If so you're doing the internet wrong. 




 I have a bird that lives outside my house. Let's call him a "special bird". He chirps all fucking night long, as soon as the sun goes down this motherfucker opens his beak and does shut it until the sun comes back up. 




 I partied till the end. Yen was not happy, fuck that bitch. 




 If she's good looking, then I completely understand. 




 That guy on the right sure has a huge melon. 




 Okay this makes sense now. As a guy I couldn't imagine the the victims reaching out to the bully. It's normally the other way round for us. 




 Wow what a dick, destroying the family from the inside. Bullying level 9000. 




 You forgot that your clock will start moving backwards. 




 ohhhhhh so that's what I have. I knew I wasn't normal. 




 ..you forgot poop. There's poop sometimes. 




 You are right, now it all makes sense. 




 Woah Woahh, I'm not having that type of language around here. It's called African American Forest Cake..And I'll see what I can do, it's not nigger season but maybe the supermarket will have some. 




 Don't tarnish Jesus's' with OP filth!! 




 ofc there's cake, what's a birthday party without cake!?..I'm guessing it's the same except without cake but we have cake so don't worry. There's no clan though, unless you want to start one. We can call ourselves the crimson duo and stop all the bad guys in our neighbourhood. Although my neighbourhood and your neighbourhood are different neighbourhoods so one of us will have move. Unless we can convince our respected towns to change the names of the street our neighbourhoods are on to Crimson street. Then we can both fight crime in Crimson Street but none of us will have to move. but first lets have that cake...it's a crimson cake. 

 nbsp;

Hope that clears it up for you!
 




 No! I will never feel bad for Roach. She is a **dick**. She has left me stranded countless amount of times. Fucking un-loyal lasagne filler.


Edit: Changed Roach's sex. 




 Aha!! Gotcha now. There was never any clan!! Now you **have** to come to my birthday party!!! **MUAHAHAHAHAAH** ...I'm a genius! 




 All we ask from you is your willingness to help the clan on their ultimate goal for a better tomorrow


^^^^^and ^^^^^the ^^^^^soul ^^^^^of ^^^^^your ^^^^^first ^^^^^born ^^^^^child.


Come, join us. We have cake!! 




 My fair guess is that they have moved on to the Witcher 3. This game was awesome but it never felt like something you could play for months on end [IMO ofc]. 




 My pleasure! 


Bonus tip: Also works when your sailing and have monsters hanging off the side of your boat.  




 I hope in the next anchor man he loses his job and needs to take up Ice Hockey commentator as a job. I'd watch that. 




 "ewww you got cooties, gay!!!"  




 Well maybe I was trying to place and underlying message in this meme saying the female of any species is "Roach like". I mean I wasn't...but it could've been. 




 Welcome brother to the crimson clan
!! (P.S if that's not the name for reds I'll be really unhappy.) 




 A win is a win."*we* *lie*, *we* *cheat*, *we* *steal!!*" RIP Eddie.G 




 Apmayune fools, pshhttt!! 




 I got a comment on a post I made on /r/gaming because of this post. As a result I ended up coming just in time to save the button and land myself a red flair. You're welcome grey army, I sacrificed myself for you!! 




 This is my first time here in a few weeks. The only reason I came back was because of a random comment on a post I made in /r/gaming which only read but /r/button. 


So I decided to click it and come to have a gander at how things are going. As soon as the page opened it was at around 20secs so I decided to unlock the button just in case. 


Thanks /u/Jafas2000 you glorious bastard! 




 You beautiful glorious bastard. I just got a 0.something click thanks to your reminder. As soon as I clicked the link the clock was at 20 so I decided to unlock the button just in case. I love you man! 




 Still not worse than my fuck up. I killed the blonde bitch, don't even remember her name and because if that you automatically fail a quest near the end of the game. I'm going to have to replay this game ...there goes another few weeks of my life. 




 Shoot them with your crossbow. One hit kill underwater. 




 You're right it does only show the "hold" option but like you said it should be obvious seeing as they are the only two modes of transport in the game. 




 Amazing scene through out. I'm guessing everyone went all the way in this one and got dressed to call the lodge. 




 Really guys?? It says so on the bottom right of your screen whilst playing. I don't want to be a dick here but if that got past by you, you are going to have a hard time playing the game. Detail is key. Happy hunting!! 




 Original pic came from /u/gmaknz [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/386t2v/dammit_roach_look_at_the_camera/) 









 That's an actual character in the game. Vernon Roche. It's a bit weird the used the same name twice. 




 This side-quest is quite funny. My favourite part was waking him up. He gets up with that thousand yard stare and flips you the bird. 




 OP's mom when she rolled over. 




 ....fuck. 




 Love how you really committed to the whole Witcher thing. Had to zoom in to read that text. 




 Smart baby. 




 You misspelled boredom and frustration. 









 looks like it was struck by lightning. 




 First post I've seen about my home town on the front page and it's about inter-species "sexual assault". Nice. 




 I still have all three in my inventory in case of impromptu masquerade ball. 




 That's not what society says. 




 You know a good way to avoid microtransactions?


 **STOP PLAYING THESE RETARDED MOBILE GAMES, THAT IS ALL THEY ARE FOR!** 




 The game was a well built game, incredible gun play, good visuals, nice classes and interesting weapons but the non-existent story was too much to just let it slide. They built this entire amazing universe from scratch and told us little to nothing about it. 




 Yrden is key! I wasn't too fond of it at the beginning and thought is was one of the more useless signs, boy was I wrong. Fought a Cyclops yesterday and Yarden was a life saver. 




 That's amazing work, Kudos!! 




 The Rock of.... 




 Yup, still have this baby and the pirate ship somewhere in storage, good times! 




 However, both the Xbox One and Playstation 4 editions of the game are now behind the PC version of The Witcher 3, which is currently live with Update 1.04.

 nbsp;

I hate when articles have no idea what they're writing about. Yes PC has had one more update than console has, but that's because there was a problem with the PC version that console versions didn't have. 




 I feel you man, I had to go to my [only child] cousins house to play with stuff like this. 




 Pandas, and good riddance. Free loading good for nothings. 




 How did he even manage to pee with a camera on him a friend standing right behind him and a stick up his butt?? I can't pee when there's someone in the same room! 




 www.southpark.cc.com works for me like it always has. Don't know what OP's talking about. 




 "GwG!?"... () ^^^Y^^^^a^^^^^y  ...*clicks*..() 




 I wasn't scared of snakes. Now I think I'm scared of snakes. Thanks. 




 I chose the other path, Baron dies and now I have the sidequest failed. Apparently you can still pick the cards up form somewhere. There's a post near the front about it. 




 I love reading posts like these after getting bombarded for being a console gamer xD 




 I'm here with you buddy! 




 I'm on level 17 at the moment and my next story quest is Skellige. I still haven't gone over though due to the fact that I want to finish all sidequests etc in Velen and Novigrad. My fear is that I'm going to end up way to high level for the actual story missions. Should I continue clearing Velen and Novigrad or should leave them for later and go to Skellige. What do you guys suggest? 




 Yea but you still end up failing that side quest, damn. 




 You're clearly doing something wrong. Where are you storing you controllers? Do you leave them facing up? 




 Doesn't matter if you're black or white. 




 Firstly, welcome back!! now onto the matter at hand.


Games: I don't know what type of games you like but I suggest Witcher 3 [obviously] and Dying light. With those two games you have a solid month of gaming ahead of you. Also Sunset Overdrive if you like the outlandish type of games. EA Access is also a really good idea to get, 20 a year and you have access to all the games in the vault (currently includes FIFA 15, NFL 15, NHL 15, NBA Live 15, BF4, Plants V Zombies and a few others) plus 10% discount on all EA digital purchases.


Accessories:Adapter for headset if your using a third party headset, plug and play kit **and** thumb grip for the analogues (I cannot stress enough how much better this makes the controller).


Happy gaming! 




 **MILF!!**. No but seriously keep up the good work, looking great! 




 Mental picture is now complete and what a glorious sight it is!!


 Full blown bear man in a drunken crying rage in the middle of a probably very echoy train station, wailing like a Wookie "WHY GOD WHY!? TAKE ME INSTEAD!!! *sniff* *sniff* All in a matter of a few seconds.


 My mornings been made, thanks!! 




 I believe the word you're searching for is **REKT!** 




 I know right, it's multiple choice for a reason. 




 ^N^^E^^^V^^^^E^^^^^R^^^^^^! 




 ^^RUN ^^YOU ^^FOOL!!! ^^^It's ^^^not ^^^safe ^^^here!! ^^^^Also ^^^^thanks, ^^^^I ^^^^agree ^^^^people ^^^^take ^^^^stuff ^^^^too ^^^^seriously ^^^^lately.  




 The title was enough warning for me.....or so I thought. FUCK. 




 Everyone has different heroes. 




 Just drop yourself really hard on your neck and you too could spend the next 4-5 years trying to walk again. 




 This kid shows promise, but lets not put all our eggs into one basket. 




 [deleted, because I'm a moron sometimes] 




 That's absolute gold, must have been amazing to witness as a bystander. Glad your adventure turned out ok :) 




 Wow. Getting downvoted because of a joke comment, lighten up assholes!!

 nbsp;

Edit: Forgot to answer your question. No I have not read the books, but that has nothing to do with what I said. I'm not arguing the fact that Geralt is an established character with a lot of history. What I'm saying is the way I play with Geralt is different. Am I not allowed to play the way I wish to play? Because I'm pretty sure that this is the reason for the game being multiple choice with many different outcomes, so that the player can play the way he/she desires. 




 If the pay's good the hours are short and I can play a lot of games in between, sign me up!! 




 Evil and brilliant, [I like it a lot.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/28GLa9T2CtI/maxresdefault.jpg)

NPC - " look at his eyes, his whore mother must've laid with a stray cat!"


^Or ^something ^very ^close ^to ^this, ^^I ^^was ^^^high.


I then proceeded to chop his head off...Nobody calls my cat a stray. 




 Awesome thanks!


This just goes to prove though that the map needs a bit of tweaking. That's clearly a merchant symbol. Loving the game though! 




 If you could stop popping to the top of the page whilst I'm trying to view the video that would be greeeaaattt. 




 People do want them back. We've just been over this same topic too many times on all the posts about the upcoming Call.of.Titanfall/AW Ops 3. 




 Well yeah but the one's inside city's tend to pay more, I've got stuff multiple items worth 200 crowns (not that I bought for that amount but what it says in the stats) and blacksmiths in villages only offer from 50-80. 




 but that 100% thoughh!! I ended up doing it twice, both on 360 and one. You could say I have a bit of a problem. I'm glad though that this time around the nuclear waste wasn't needed for the 100%. Fuck me that took forever and with no sea life in the last gen it was the dullest hour of gaming I've had in my life, but then again 100%. 




 I do remember Hatorri saying some one was controlling all the base materials he needs for crafting armour. Perhaps I have to complete the sidequest and take this guy out before other blacksmiths show up. That's the only reason, apart from IGN maps being wrong, that I can think of. Still a few levels away from being able to even attempted that quest though. 




 These new mods are really getting out of hand. 




 He's not the only blacksmith in Novigrad that's the thing, there are others that I've used and they appear on this [map](http://www.ign.com/maps/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/velen-novigrad) but for some reason they do not appear on my map. Maybe my game has bugged out a bit?? Not sure what to think tbh. 




 Really?? well that sucks. He isn't even a blacksmith in my game yet he's still making dumplings.  




 There a dwarf and a wife willing to craft really good armour for you if you get the tools for them. Unfortunately I cannot remember where or if he was a master but a little Google search might help. Good luck. 




 Is Gwent really that good?? I just find it way to be a lot of time wasting. There's already enough to do in the game without having to worry about my card collection at the same time. It's just a bit too much for my liking. 




 FTFY: Well


Not the direction I was heading in buddy. Just saying my version of Geralt does things a bit differently to the "real" version. 




 We should all get together and make a company where we make money by browsing Reddit;

 nbsp;

Step 1: get together


Step 2: Give company a kick ass name


Step 3: ???????


Step 4: All the pancakes we can eat aka profit. 




 Geralt really isn't the type of guy to just murder anything that's a monster.


My version of Geralt and you version of Geralt are veryyyy different.

 nbsp;

Edit: To make it clear, I'm not arguing with the real history or Geralt. Thats just not how I play with him. My Geralt cuts the head off anything monster shaped (i.e All the downvoters moms). 




 Team Triss ftw! tricked that hoe bag into staying yesterday. 




 Seriously, we're already looking at the next game?? Come on guys enjoy what was just given to us before looking for your next fix you bunch of crack whores. 




 I don't know if it's just me but a lot of the stuff (i.e merchants, blacksmiths, barbers etc) just do not appear on the map. Only when I'm near them do they appear and as you can imagine it's not very helpful.


Is there a map I have to pick up to update mine or what am I missing?


My map looks too bare especially Novigrad the biggest city in the game has one blacksmith showing in the whole of it, which to top off, is Hattori who is unusable unless you do his sidequest at level 20 something. 




 I'm currently at one level over my story quest but thing is I have a tonne of sidequests etc to do before I move onto this main quest. I see myself having to up the difficulty because it's just gonna get to the point where im one hit killing nearly everything. 




 A chat?? I would get straight fired. Yesterday I spent the entirety of the day browsing Reddit. I think I may have a problem. 




 ..it does. 




 The only thing I hate about Novigrad is the blooming map. For me it doesn't show where any of the merchants, blacksmiths etc are, only when I get near them do they appear then disappear soon after. Apart from that 10/10. 




 All that comes to mind is, fucking cunts.
