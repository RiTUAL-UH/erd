 Offer to do something she wants. or a fetish.
only fair. 




 I'd rather share my opinion about the multitude of threads talking about the banning of FPH.
 




 Yes, 100%. My depression was based on not knowing how to communicate, cope, express myself, because of my upbringing. And other things of course (genetics, imbalance). But yes, that's why I started to use. Some others here may say they didn't start because of this, but continued to use because of depression. Slippery slope. Fuck depression.

Edit: opiates have been 10x better for my depression than SSRIs/SNRIs. 




 This happens all the time. They just changed the packaging. One is newer than the other.

 To rebuild again and learn from this. To realize the compassion and similarities in others. To try and find the "highs" in life. To meet me.  




 I had one, and we fell in love. Now we don't talk and really would like someone that is in the same boat as me. They should have a depression dating site. 




 Yes, there is more risk vaginally, but I would of course make them wear condoms, which obv is still risky (this whole situation isn't ever going to happen), but does cut down. I honestly feel BJs are more personal and I would be able to have sex with a gross guy but I probably would not be able to give a gross guy a BJ. 




 Doesn't matter either way, imo. I think you're safe with just the shirt. 




 I'm F and yeah, it's a turn on because it means he's going to eat me out which is literally the best thing in the entire WORLDDDD. 




 I don't even understand what your job or company is... 




 come on down im broke 




 $300 vag  sex, $600 BJ. 




 Well black is sleek but who cares? I like the white too.  




 Good for you, not just for realizing you have a problem, but for getting your wife involved and putting things on the table.  




 Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences. 

What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes.

Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above.

And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc.

This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things. 




 shia labeouf, jennifer aniston, Fat Amy, Leonardo Decaprio, Florence and the Machine... 




 wow. Just wow.


wow. 




 Draw Lucille Ball on top of a pogo stick, hopping on the stomach of a 400 lb man with an afro that is simultaneously playing the violin. 




 Um, probably people believing in me, telling me i'm talented, "the best", interesting, funny, etc. Encouraging me to make something of my life, I like those people and their energy.  




 Please don't tell me I'm not depressed because I'm not acting the same way you were when depressed. Ye, I'm clinically depressed and have been since my diagnosis 1.5 years ago. I'm both bored and disinterested in my job, because I'm bored and disinterested with every component in my life. I feel no joy or interest in anything and this is certainly not y first time taking a mental health day. 




 this is really hot, actually. 




 Oxford, England. 




 THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.

Seriously, I was you 6 months ago. Taking opiates because it was the only thing that worked. Some people get depressed and suicidal because of the pills, I was depressed and took the pills to stop the depression. It got out of control and I had to stop. Now I'm on antidepressants that barely help. They suck. Opiates are much better but I'm constantly debating if it's worth the risk. 

Kratom is legal and similar to opiates for me, in terms of motivation and interest. 




 Tell him and make your life YOUR life.  




 WOW! I've been researching ECT because meds just don't seem to be helping. What's your timeline look like as far as first med tried and last? I've gone through prozac, cymbalta, lexapro, and then wellbutrin and another one I can't remember. Getting discouraged, I hate going to my doctor and having to tell him "Nope, still want to die." I hope he doesn't give up on me or get frustrated. 




 Oh my god, so many feels. 




 I've been meaning to check that out, thanks for the reminder. 




 Education systems. 




 Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job!

At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!

I'm sure some people hate it, however, and these people are probably those that hate their job, menu, or products.

 hands are to cold, my meds don't give me any feeling down there.

 baggy jeans. You don't have to wear skinny, tight jeans, but wear something that fits your body. Also, sneakers are something that bother me. Obviously, you can wear sneakers, but theres a certain type that screams "grandpa" or "dad" that creeps me out. 




 Construction or enter a trade. Work somewhere with room to grow, ex hotel. Take a career aptitude test.

Why don't you like your jobs? Rather than saying they suck, think of the specifics, and then generalize them. For example, I found I can't handle a job/company that doesn't allow creative freedom. 




 Thanks. A lot of information here. I should post in this sub more often because you're all terribly helpful.

I'll start by looking at my manuel. There's nothing specific I want to know, I just feel stupid when a guy pops the good to take a look, and I would have no idea where to start. 




 Original borrow of $150, pay $55 for 3 installments. Great borrower, very honest and trustworthy. Fully paid on time! 




 I'm a female but don't know anything. I could probably change a tire but I want to know what connects to what, what parts look like, etc. I feel there should be a minimum that we put men able to fix, but I think that should go for everyone. 




 Too much attention, feels like I'm showing off and the center of the universe which I don't like. Preconceived expectations about how you're SUPPOSED to celebrate, but never do anything exciting. And dislike of another year passing (usually in relation to feelings about not being successful/in a good place vs. what you think you should be at that age).

 pineapple upside down cake!!!! 




 Go on a site that switches letters around in a word or phrase to make a new word or phrase with the same letter. I can't remember what they're called right now... 




 Awesome! That's is exactly what I'm looking for! 




 Clitoris and your tounge. Kissing.  




 All parties need to get off before you leave 




 Honestly, if you like her is suggest waiting until dating. Things might get funny with sex, it happened to me.

Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.

I despise guys that leave after they cum after 2 minutes. Nothing more disrespectful. 




 Call people up for sex 




 This is why I've never visited old teachers.. 




 Nerve, Heavy Gloom, and How you are.

They all blend in and as of right now, they all sound SO similar. However, it's a really great album to listen to while doing something. Really pumped up and enjoyable. 




 Thank you!! I applied for the open nccc's open! 




 I want to do something similar, have a business degree though. What's your official job title and can others get in like you? 




 Stories of reddit stepping in and saving lives. There's been a few, one I remember about a runaway abused wife.

In a most shocking post, someone posted a video of a guy being decapitated and sliced all over, all his limbs off and then just beating the shit out of him. Really gruesome. 




 Are the nccc'a the 10 month, full paid rooming thing I was looking at? 




 Close you eyes and pucker up for a kiss. Now you know that answer. 




 Love and be loved. Be free and help others gain strength. 




 vagina, butt, mouth. we got this under control. 




 I haven't worked in a market but have worked at a place that does samples. The worst is people that just want something free and pick it up and keep walking. Or anyone that seems as if they're definitely not going to buy anything. If you take a sample, expect to stay for 30 seconds and let me tell you about the product. If you want to try all of them because you want to try something new and potentially buy, I have no problems with you. 




 We're on the right track! I'll do something like this. 




 Ill probably just text him to fuck the shit out of me.

And yeah, I guess people do t user stand my question ? 




 human life - happiness, fulfillment
human race - simultaneously finding happiness while embracing others and helping them on their quest for happiness 




 Probably not 




 Mierda is shit? Wasn't that girl from tangled named mierda?
