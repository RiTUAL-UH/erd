 That's true, although it is suggested that  bloodtypes omit certain markers which a mosquito can detect: 
Blood-type markers are chemicals released by people of a specific blood type  so if someone with AB blood emitted a marker, it would be different than that released by B. One study found persons with Type O blood suffered more mosquito landings because of the odorant markers they emit than any other blood type, making their juices a hot commodity for blood banks, as well as Asian Tiger Mosquitoes, which carry West Nile Virus. Not only were Type Os more likely to be landed on, but the study found that for any blood type, people who secreted a chemical marker about their blood type through their skin (both blood type and secretor status are determined by genes) were bitten much more than non-secretors; 24 percent in the case of the Type Os. Other researchers estimate about 15 percent of the population, based on their genes, dont emit chemical markers of their blood type through their skin and saliva, so something else has to be calling the mosquitoes to them.

 The bowl should probably be heated to body temperature, to mimic the warmth of the human body.

 We got kampers in the netherlands, which is pretty much the same as White trash in the states. For a very funny, over the top illustration of their behaviour watch New Kids nitro http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2043932/
Or turbo: http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2043932/
i hope there's a version with english subtitles, but both movies are definitely a good laugh
