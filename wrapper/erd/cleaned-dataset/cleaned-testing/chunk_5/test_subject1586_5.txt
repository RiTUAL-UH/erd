 "Now that's what I call a sticky situation!" 




 Called it. Hit the Bricks. The whole "Me first" mentality was the opposite of *Playing like a Brown*. He has been consistently negative and he can get glad in the same pants he got mad in.  He can just do it somewhere else. 




 I didn't have a red one, all I could afford was a BIIIIG yellow one. 




 Nice try, *Johnny*. 




 Let's look at someone comparable to Gordon: Megatron. They have this figured out with Megatron:

*"If you were watching ESPN Sport Science last October, you saw what a freak of nature Calvin Johnson actually is. Between his 6'5" height and his 6'10" wingspan, he has an 8'8" standing reach. Add in a 45" vertical jump and you've got a guy that can cover over 4,000 cubic feet, all from a standing position. Add it up: Calvin covers an incredible area, more than an average two-car garage."*

Well Gordon is 3 inches shorter with a 36" jump and a 6'8" wingspan. I would put that somewhere closer to 3500 cubic feet total access to teh ball when thrown to him. He totally will have more chances to catch the ball than the 5'10" receiver corps. 

ALGEBRAIC!

And Hoyer fucking rules. Today included. *Snoogins* 




 What's up with Johnny's scary little hand? 




 For the sake of argument would you say, perhaps, Browns? 




 Either way would be good. 




 Where did you find that picture? 




 I trust Farmer. Dumpeda-bump-bump-buM-bUM-BUM. 




 They have all the Twitter accounts of the teammates, reporters, and coaches that represent the Texans. That's a cool resource, especially for people new to the fan-base. 




 We might start getting to draft for depth and development......*mind blown* 




 Browns fan,  here. O'Brien is 6-2 in weather under 40
*EDIT: O'Brien just had to be different with his name spelling. Fixed* 




 Just ordered me a Haden Jersey. Also got a Cribbs jersey a few weeks ago, and my first jersey was a gift from a friend. A retooled Hillis jersey that my boy stenciled my last name on. He even made the stencil in the exact font of the Browns Font. Where are you buying it from? 




 Brown face mask is cool. Grey uniforms is so ugly.....so, so, ugly.

*EDIT: It's official color designation is "Seal Brown"?*

 




 Please Gods, No. Please dont make our Uni's grey.
 




 I think this is the most likely scenario.  




 Respectfully,  why is it so bad?  




 I'm so glad to read this! I have been saying the same thing for a while. WE are America's Team. There are so many people that don't like the Cowboys that calling them America's Team is completely inaccurate. Everyone in football is happier when the Browns do well.THAT should be the hallmark that garners such a nickname.  




 Boobs for Browns is an r/Browns institution. We should never talk bad about it, and we should promote it during every NFL subreddit members drive from here until forever. 




 Mike Freeman is an asshat. He hasnt been saying any of those things all season. I even got in a fight with him on twitter this summer about how damaging his type of journalism can be to the mentality of a team that is struggling. *rant over* 




 Frakkin' brilliant. Thank you SO MUCH! 




 I used to live in Atlanta. It's like going to the Panthers sub and finding out they are rooting for the Ravens to win.  




 It was a sketch that had a machine that made you smart. Someone goes into it and they reverse it to make the person stupid, and they come out as a Steelers fan. I have looked for 3 years and cant find it. This is the only place I can think that might be able to do so. 




 I was just commenting about how much nicer our header is than the Steelers, Bengals, and Ravens.
 




 Holy shit, I know the redhead kneeling down in front of the dude in the purple shirt. I went to Highschool with her. I bet she knocks the fire out of people. 




 Yeah. I have always considered the Bengals to be like playing our brothers. Sometimes we hate each other, and sometimes we have mad respect, but at the end of the day I never throw your name in when I say Fuck the Steelers and Fuck the Ravens. One more time to go, boys!
 




 1st place at game 10?!??!?!?! **WE DEY!!** 




 **MOTHERFUCKING N**
 




 Wow. Browns are in there a bunch.  









 If you have a Hoyerection lasting more than 4 games, please enjoy it.
 




 The completion to Hawkins that he made as he was getting destroyed by the Bucs D? That was outstanding.  




 That puts his total to 4 on the year in 8 appearances.
 




 Lou Groza and Phil Dawson. The Toe, and The Other Toe. He is the second highest scorer in CLE history. The Automatic. *EDIT: Content* 




 Give that man a Dog Bone for his collar! 




 Today at 6pm Pacific Time, Pierre Claveloux Pete Pathfinder Davis was taken across the veil. He was surrounded by loved ones, and went peacefully in his bed. Today, on our most holy day, when the barrier between the Worlds was at its thinnest, and on the 35th anniversary of the founding of his lifes work, The Aquarian Tabernacle Church; our Grandmother Hekate, Patron Goddess of our Order came across and brought home with her one of her most devoted sons. Founder of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, Panegyria Magazine, Spiral Scouts, The Pagan Information Network, and Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary, Petes contribution to Wicca, and Pagan rights can never be overstated. From prison ministries, to Veterans rights, and his ability to standardize our faith through the Government, Petes legacy, and the freedoms enjoyed from his actions will be felt throughout the duration of Wicca on Earth.

Pete Pathfinder: Born on Ostara, 1937. Crossed into the Summerlands on Samhain, 2014.

Please hold your phone calls until Nov. 2nd and give the family and church time to grieve. If you would like to post your condolences for the time being, please go to: [The ATC Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ATCIntl)  




 At least someone really gets what it means to have to rely on Brandon Weedon. 




 I agree with "/u/tits" in the messages. 




 CC all day. Was totally safe. 




 Sorry! I used [Top Seller Jersey](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1066076) 




 http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0 initiative_id= SearchText=cleveland+browns+jersey 




 I totally wear an XXL. I have a 38in waist, and really broad shoulders,  and weigh in at 225lbs. Mine fits really well.  Not too big,  not too small. Goldilocks.

 I upset some folks by posting something from my twitter account earlier, about Joe Haden being my favorite #23 over Lebron. (which made some people get really upset. said it messed with the integrity of the sub to post from personal twitter accounts) Then they assured me the downvoting would end when I removed the post (which is a little like a reddit gestapo) that it was only because of the twitter association. So now I post this, and the downvoting continues. Browns fans use the down vote as a punishment, as well as an opinion. *shrug* It's okay. I'm stoked for my new jersey and I love the Browns :) *EDIT: As proven by the the post below about not wanting knock off jersey posts, even though every other post about people getting Browns gear at a good deal has been uproaringly upvoted*
 




 Growing up in Kent, all the crime that came into town was from Akron. Yes, its a depressed and yucky place. I have lived in Atlanta (which is far more dangerous) and Seattle (way higher homeless population) and I do have a bruised opinion of Akron. It does not sway my opinion about LeBron, but this article on this Family Foundation is. 




 No, I do know what I'm talking about. "His mere presence is estimated to be worth $500 million a year" That's not for schools. That's private sector earnings. Some taxes might make it to the schools, but that's not the same.  I did find something about the Lebron Family Foundation that I will read up on. Thank you for making me dig deeper. I dont want to dislike him. I just havent seen anything that makes me feel differently. Maybe this will.
 




 It's not his fault that they had them. He was 15. It's the responsibility of us all to make it easier for those coming up behind us. You say he does a ton for Akron. Tell me so I can change my opinion.  




 Everything is awesome. It is a little old, and there is some yellowing on the edges of the lettering, but it's a 2012. Every other thing about it is great. My only complaint is that Washington has some rule about not letting money be put into escrow when ordering from overseas, and so I had to get it mailed to Georgia, and then have them send it to me in WA. Totally buying a Haden jersey next. 









 Shitlord. Nice.
 




 Your entitlement about policing the websites allowed to be x/posted from is killing me. 




 We should downvote the content, not the site. People use the downvote in this sub as a weapon. We just got in trouble for going to other subs and using the downvote as a weapon. So, I wont post any more from my twitter. I also wont agree with the outlook. 




 I'm not stunned.  




 It was all local media reports. St Vincent was not the school he was in district for. He got a scholarship to attend. And the school he was supposed to attend had an expose done on them where they found they were still using text books from the 50's and they showed these holes in the ceilings of the class rooms with black mold in them. Akron is a cesspool. I can understand him wanting to never help out the scummiest town I have ever been in, I just think it's wrong of him. He's part of that scum, even if he did float to the top. Kent for Life. *EDIT: Sorry I dont remember the exact reports from 15 years ago.* 




 Really? Because every post about Hoyers lack of skill reads JUST LIKE THAT to me. So weird.  




 I repeat from my "twitter post": There is no rule about posting from your twitter, facebook, tumblr, or anything else. Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct.  




 I never link to my twitter. Maybe twice in the history of being on reddit. I use twitter to talk to famous people who have twitter, because I can link my post right into their feed. I wanted to show that I had told both LeBron and Haden my feelings. There is no rule about posting from your twitter, facebook, tumblr, or anything else. Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct. 




 If that's how you want to hear what I said, then bully on you. 
 




 Also that /u/rsipp512 would rather hear about all the topics we cover day in and day out, than to hear anything new or an opinion that might be from a fans personal media. Unless it's his perspective, and his media, I'm sure. Himz an enforcer. So I am complying and posting the same thing. Just like everyone else all over the web. Hoyer v Manziel conjecture. 24/7
 




 This is the problem. Browns fans refusing to hear what is right in front of them. Obviously we need way more posts about this to help you understand. 




 I disliked him before he went pro. I am from Kent, OH. I watched LeBron grow up on my local television networks. I constantly heard the reports about him getting Escalades paid for by the school he was being scholarshipped into, while the school he left was using books from the 1950's and kids were being removed with black mold sickness. I've never heard article one about him putting his money back into those school districts. Maybe if he used his money to help the people that he left behind, then I would have a change of heart. Coming back to CLE and promising a championship is like going to the sun and promising cotton candy. It's no given that it is going to happen. He stepped all over the people that manicured him and removed him from poverty, and now he is back, and It's all chill? I just need more from him. I need him to use his leg up to create a new standard for the kids coming from the same place he did. If he has done that, and I missed it, (I do live in Washington now) I am all about changing my tune. I just think he's kind of a selfish brat. 




 This is a reddit for all things Browns. My opinion about Haden falls under that category. I'll try to post about Hoyer conjecture in the future to keep things normal. 




 Lol. 




 I do not like LeBron. Hadens the only 23 for me. 




 Yeah! Downvotes for Joe Haden!  




 A typical overdose from cocaine: There is a membrane between your nasal cavity and your brain. This bit of flesh keeps your brain fluids in your head. Eventually,  its different for everybody, cocaine will eat through that lining, all the goo from your brain will fall out of your nose, and you'll die. You know in the movies where someone does a line and their nose starts bleeding uncontrollably and they die? That's pretty close. 




 Haden. Nice. upvote for you, sir. 




 You, **FIEND!!!!** *NOOOOOOOOoooooooooooOOOoooo!!!!* I'm upvoting you on principal.  




 I have called "Moving the Chains" on SiriusXM and told them this idea. They pretty much blew me off, but I still think that it's a good idea. I think bringing in as many of the old Browns players that want to mentor and work with the team as possible is a goodt idea. I realize some people cant teach, or coach, and that it is a totally different skill set than being a player. I also think it will bring the energy of "Play Life a Brown" further into fruition when these young players begin finding some new favorite players in the Browns of Old. Wanting to prove yourself in front of people you respect is a great motivator. *EDIT: And Thank You* 




 I dont know about your downvotes. I do know that it's equally important to consider WHEN you say something, as WHY you say something. That being said, McCoy  Weeden. You are correct. Upvote for you. 




 Considering two of those TD's involved GREAT hands, I'm glad to know all of our receivers are that clutch. 




 I would be all over Cribbs as an Assistant Special Teams Coach 




 I can get behind that, mostly.  I don't see him as a game manager, *EDIT: I think he's an outright good QB*,  but I think a sample size of a whole season will tell us a lot.  




 At what point does it become a well educated following? 




 Yes. This. This rings with all the truth. I feel like a grok it now. Thank you. *EDIT: Gold for you, sir. This has plagued me for too long* 




 I understand it has something to do with the long rebuild of the Browns, but where did it start and what are the details around it. I want to understand. 




 McCoy  Weeden 




 McCoy is SO MUCH better than Weeden. 




 *"The Cleveland Browns beat the lowly Oakland Raiders to move to 4-3, which in itself is a massive accomplishment.*

*That's not meant to crap on the Browns, but the coaching staff in Cleveland is doing an amazing job coaching up the talent on the roster. Brian Hoyer at quarterback, no Alex Mack, a rotating backfield, no Josh Gordon and yet they're competitive in a loaded AFC North. Let's get Mike Pettine and Kyle Shanahan on some Coach/Assistant Coach of the Year ballots.*

*The rest of the season won't be easy, given the schedule and talent issues, but I'm past betting against this team. ***The Browns are one of the NFL's grittiest teams***, and winning ugly, cold, muddy football games in November and December seems very realistic."* 









 Nice try, Johnny. 




 **A** 




 Im not acting like you hurt my feelings. Im pointing out that you are agressive. I reallynliked Colt McCoy, and if you looked at my messages from the game the other night, my friend was keeping me up to date on the game, because hes one of my favorite Browns QBs. No need to be grumpy. 




 I never minimized his health. Your anger is pushing you to make assumptions. I said his dad was the nail in the coffin. You are arguing that Colts injury is what made us cut him, and THAT seems highly unlikely that a concussion will cause a team to let you go. A raging parent that you wouldn't have to deal with had the person not been on your team? That makes sense. Oh, and [this from 2012.](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/05/03/report-brad-mccoys-comments-sealed-colts-fate-in-cleveland/) Blessings on you and Go Browns! 




 I'm sorry. It seems like you dont want to have a civil discussion. I am sorry that this is how people have treated you, and that you feel that it is okay to be so aggressive when you perceive that people are wrong. Is this how they treated you when you made a mistake as a child? I can imagine. Parents and adults can be really cruel. Lots of people have played through a concussion, and plenty of peoples parents havent come into the locker room like it was a Texas High School and yelled at the coaches. We have lawyers for that sort of thing in the pros. Again, I'm sorry for your need to be so mean, and Go Browns! 




 I saw him get knocked out, and then his dad came in and yelled at the staff about taking care of his boy, and then Colt stayed Benched, and then we traded him. I am all about learning more if there is more. 




 Awesome. I'm not wholly sold on the debunking, but I'm not wholly sold on the validation of existence, either. I havent had a chance to study about it because, obviously, I had the wrong name. Thank you! 




 She has food allergies and the kitchen has never taken them into consideration like I did, before. For 20 years she spent hundreds of dollars for a weekend and couldnt eat the food she had paid for. 




 Blew my mind. 




 I think Colt McCoy's daddy ruined his career in Cleveland. 




 OH! I see what you mean. I said I braised them with salt and pepper. Yes, I SEARED them with salt and pepper, then mirapoix, then braised them in Wine and Apple Juice. Thank you for pointing that out to me.
 




 I was instructed to sear it in the pan, make a maripoix, and then re-add the meat and fill just about halfway up with liquid (wine and apple juice for this one), and then bake. Sorry if I was unclear! 




 On the entire weekend, for 120 people, I spent right around $2k, which was $2.5k less than the previous year.  




 RODS!! Yes. Thank you. 
 




 Everyone can celebrate with me! We had a blast and it was in part because of this wonderful sub! Thank you all, and Karma for all the wonderful encouragement!
 




 Okay, First off I will disappoint everyone, but hopefully I will make up for it with the story. I didn't get pictures. I was so busy this weekend that I got 10 hours of sleep from Thursday to Sunday, and 5 of them came from Saturday to Sunday. I have [this picture](http://imgur.com/8GIvVbZ) that I took. It shows the concept, but I tried to upload it before the event, and my phone wouldn't let me. My menu was really simple. I'll tell you the entire production for the final nights feast. 

We had what I named Harvest Feast Pork (not very original, but it went with the theme)  I took my trimmed, 2-3 inch cubed pieces of pork leg, and braised them with salt an pepper. Then I added used olive oil, and garlic instead of onion in my mirapoix (so celery, carrot, and garlic). To deglaze I used white wine (chardonnay) and apple juice. I then added a rosemary/parsley bouquet garni. I put it in at 350 for 4 hours. When the meat came out, I used corn starch as a thickener.  Earlier in the day, my morning crew had peeled, cored, and sliced into quarters, 5 bags of apples and pears. I then panned them, covered them in cinnamon, and made a slurry of apple juice, water, cinnamon, and sugar. I poured that over the top and set to cook it for 2 1/2 hours at 350. I also learned how to use convection ovens this weekend (that was cool) and I made near to 90 squash that we served in quarters. I had also made a "Hobbit Stew" earlier and put up in the freezer for the feast. It was a homemade Veggie stock (carrots, celery, leek, garlic, ginger, rosemary, thyme, parsley) and then I used it as the base for turnips, parsnips, rutabagas, yellow/purple/red potatoes, sweet potatoes, purple yams, and Asian yams which I served a ladle of to everyone. Then corn on the cob cooked in water with a little sugar and apple juice, as well as pretzel rolls were the sides. It was an amazing feast. We had pumpkin pie (store bought) to accompany everything and southern style sweet tea to beat the band. 

We had 2 other dinners that were made in the same exact way except they were beef, and the bouquet garni was rosemary, and then thyme on the second one.  It was wonderful and I could never have done it without you. I will scour the pictures coming out from the event and see if anyone took pictures of their food. Since that is all instagram seems to be used for, I am hoping it is inevitable that I can find some. Thank you again and I am a life long follower of /r/cooking from here on out!

 




 Yeah. My main goal is to find the video. 




 So you have the video?  




 Thank you for  all your help with my dilema. (huge chunks of meat needing to be cooked for many people) Someone literally cried because they had never had such good food in the 20 years they had been attending the event. Thank you /r/cooking, you rock. 




 They were called "Tubes" in the video, and they were caught on a Nat Geo documentary (I think) about base jumping into a giant hole in a jungle somewhere. They were caught on the video, but were unseen by the divers. Anyone? 




 I'm an everyday, off the internet witch, who does very little in the actual pagan community. I'm just out of my element, here. Sorry guys.  




 I just called to get Cable set up in my business, and the lady I talked to was a in Cleveland, so I of course said "Go Browns!" and she said "Hell yeah 'Go Browns'!". After an hour long call that was 40 minutes of Browns fandom, she gave me an extra 10$ off my package! "You're a Browns fan, so I'm going to do what I can to help you out". The world she is a-changin'. :) 




 Most pit bull breeds are smaller than a golden retriever.  None are big enough to be what you're describing.  




 AND you called me a twat. What is that? LOL. We call folks derogatory names in this sub? Or is that just how you roll? Is that how you "engage" folks?
 




 You did exactly that, earlier. You crossed your arms, stuck out your tonge, and told me I had "unmitigated hubris". I'm not talking to the mods, I am talking to the person who doesnt know me who told me to take it to /r/nativeamericanspiritualists when they arent even PAGAN! I'm not gonna drop my d ^k on the table and tell you my lineage or my degrees, but I has 'em, Jack. I'm wondering why you are here? Why are you preying on /r/pagans? Do you have a lot of friends here? You get a lot of upvotes for telling pagans they should shoot, or run over Coyotes that they see?  




 /r/heathen says what? Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a peach. Seriously, though. Why are you here? To tell Pagans they are stupid? I'm totally engaging you now. I'm engaging you on the fact that you are a square hanging out with circles and yelling about our number of degrees. LOL 




 Wait a minute....You're a Heathen?!?!?! LOLOLOL You're whole argument is invalid. I thought some pagan was being a jerk to me and being an antagonist, now I see it's nothing more than a heathen, acting normal. /r/heathen kick you out? You dont understand us. I totally get it now. You are excused for your ignorance, but I do wonder why you're monopolizing /r/pagan? Seriously, did /r/heathens kick you out? Happy Samhain, sir. LOL
 




 You're an antagonist.  




 The fact that I was raised Native American Spiritualist is enough for me. You win, though. This subreddit is not for me. 




 I find your lack of faith and your trash talk arrogant and off-putting. It's a bad look for r/pagans to take a post from someone who is like "I dont know if I'm pagan, but this was the only place I felt safe to share my magical experience" and then tell them not everything is magic, and it's probably a rabid coyote and not anything worth anything. 
 




 I think maybe you meant to be in r/skeptics. This is r/pagan. *EDIT: Also, Everything IS remarkable and significant. Life just rolls like that. MORE EDIT: It's important to live an examined life where you realize that the world creates itself in your image, everyday. I once read a great sentence: "Religion isn't just what you think about things, it's what you do about things, and how you do it". This is what it means to understand your spiritual path, and to understand that the universe is creating itself for you every moment.*
  




 This was the correct place to post. Goddess speaks to us through her messengers. It takes living a deliberate life,  actively believing in the magic around you, to hear the messages of the divine.  Coyote is totally on the payroll and carries a strong message when you cross paths.  




 It plays on the fact that they are part of the Dawg Pound, and it plays on the idea of the "Ground and Pound" in MMA fighting. They just pound the hell out of everyone with their Ground game. And thank you :) 




 The Ground Pound 




 I personally was taught that every time you see an animal in such a manner, that it is deliberate. Maybe you need to focus on someone trying to trick you, or maybe Coyote is telling you to learn how to take a joke, or to be aware of your surroundings? It could also be telling you that you need to sing with those that are of your same kind. It DID lead you here. Just sayin'.
