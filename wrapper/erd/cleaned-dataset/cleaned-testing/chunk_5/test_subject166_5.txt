Most agencies have their own guidelines and format that you can follow.  My experience is not recent, however, so I'm not sure where the RFPs (request for proposals) are posted these days.  Contact the agency that might cover the area you are interested in developing.  Ask them! 




 What's new? 




 Good comment.
 




 I believe these businesses were paying higher wages when Clinton was President because there was not enough supply of low-wage workers. 









 She works for me. 




 It would be 50 years or more before another bill would be done.  Dems have been trying to do this since Roosevelt. 




 They have to do SOMETHING.  They don't know how to govern, but they need to fill the schedule. 














 What is it with these folks?  They are crazy, unprincipaled. 














 Democrats don't hate Obama.   They actually like him but are disappointed that he hasn't taken on the system more. 














 That's how it was then too.  Only Woodward and Bernstein were reporting on it, and even then, news was thin prior to the 72 election.  It only started coming out AFTER he was reelected. 




 Seriously, I have wondered about that for years. 




 I threw up in someone's car once.   I wanted to apologize the next day, but couldn't remember who was there.  Never found out, and no one every mentioned it to me. 




 I was watching c-span and was shocked to hear him quote something he must have heard from Fox News - and it was wrong!  If you are not going to use the constitution, at least use facts! 




 I knew someone who used to do it, and got a new car every year.  She was very methodical and followed up regularly with her clients. 




 It means its time to tax the rich.
 




 I agree! 









 I didn't look at the article but worked as a employment counselor in a poor neighbors before. Only jobs at that time were mom and pop businesses, poor transportation, and the cost of bus fares and time it takes to getting anywhere.  I used to ask people their priority - close to home or higher hourly pay. Most preferred closer to home due to time. 




 I picked one up once decades ago.  He was carrying a large paper sack.  When he got out of the car, he reached in the bag and gave me a plastic baggie filled with grass.  I don't give strangers rides anymore, but it was a great memory. 




  I was taught in kinergarden to look both wars before I walk. People don't do that anymore. They feel like they own the road. It is scary nonetheless for everyone. 




 My grandfather worked for Great Northern Railroad for 50 years. And yikes, I was born in Seattle a year after this photo was taken... 




 This happened in Nevada too.  They didn't press charges against the company or the  employees. 














 We fought a war over state's rights too, and won. I keep hearing about state's rights. I'm cheating though. Didn't read the article. 














 So gross. 




 Let the public pay the salaries of employees? 




 I realized it, but it was too late to edit... I'm embarassed also.  Nothing worse than getting someone's name wrong. 









 Also, I remember the dirty look he gave Nancy Pelosi - Don't remember now if it was for illegal activities of GWB or the war, but it was searing, and I think caused her to change her answer. 




 If you don't have insurance, try health centers of Nevada. Located at Cambridge Comm Center. I haven't been there, but started a similar clinic years ago.   It is nonprofit, fed subsidized. They will accept insurance however. Very close to unlv. 









 Looks better than the door that I use as a top. 




 It is past time that we admit it:  The government subsidizes wages of large corporations through SNAP, medicaid and other forms of services.  We say it is for the poor, but it corporations paid a decent wage, then these services wouldn't be needed. 














 I would probably take the round the world cruise that takes a year or so and stops if every major port. 




 Don't you love how these legislatures care for their own people. Sounds like a voter registration opportunity to me. 









 Yes. I'm now 64 yrs old. Even though I have been married for over 40 yrs, I never had a friend with similar interests, including my spouse. Would like to plan, design and work on projects that could be fun and meaningful.  I have ideas at different times, but everyone is just busy doing their own thing and isn't interested.  









 I saw it a few years ago on tv.  Interesting. 




 I agree with that! 









 Now, if all these folks would register and ensure to vote..... 




 Actually, if they had recounted, Gore would have won Florida.  The Supreme Court stopped the vote.  Gore also had more votes nationwide, but lost due to delegate count (excluding Florida).  




 A can of tuna, a can of mushroom soup and cooked noodles topped with shreaded cheese and baked. 




 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood by Eric Burton I believe, or maybe Still haven't found what I'm looking for by Bono. 
























 My city had two bond issues one year on the ballot, one for schools and one for prisons.  I was shocked when the prison bond went through but schools failed. How short-sighted and sad.@ 




 That's why they call it conservative Sundays regarding tv. 




 Wow.  I heard they liked beer.  I put some out and only one showed up.  Never heard about watermelon. 




 Didn't they get retroactive immunity for this once already????? 




 I think it was a tv show hosted by Alfred Hitchcock.  A boy grew mushrooms in his basement.   They ended up taking over his body.  Very scary.  




 Conspicuous consumption. 




 Thank you. 




 The head of the IRS is a republican appointed by Bush.  You could built a good conspiracy theory here! 




 I just wish it was more consumer oriented. 









 Take me wlth you.
 




 Me too.
 




 Zion is about 3 hrs out of Las Vegas.  The Zions Narrows is an 18 mile hike down the river.  While I've walked a ways up the river, the full hike is on my short list.  It is beautiful there.  They only allow so many people in the canyon however, so you need to make arrangements first with the Park. 




 Where is this? 




 If those 1.5 million residents vote, the state will turn blue.  It's heading that way anyway. 




 Fun. 




 Sick huh? 




 Desert Bloom.  Although there are photos of old Vegas including LVHS, I heard it wasn't filmed here.  And no one mentions Viva Las Vegas! 









 I hate to tell you, but most people want to work.  It's hard for a lot of people to work when it's not enough to pay their rent. 




 Not really. It just told them what they want to believe, even if wrong. 









 After a few years, I decided to get serious, and I got to be pretty good.  I practiced with set shots including spot shots, draw and follow.  The other key for me was to be able to see through three shots, so I played a lot of three-ball just trying to make three shots in a row.  If you can continually make three shots, you can run out. 




 That looks pretty good!  Wish I had one right now. 




 I feel the same way.   




 For those of you who like this, there is a facebook site: Las Vegas, The Good ol' days.  A lot of old timers put photos, film and other comments on the page. 




 NPR did a piece on this, and some of the songs were hilarious.  A bunch of people played the Rightious Bros "You've Lost that Loving Feeling" at their wedding! 




 Me too. 




 Also, public housing stopped being built and HUD started contracting out Section 8 housing to investors owning multiple houses.  I remember seeing a story in my town where a man was renting a house to his girlfriend, and HUD was paying the rent. 




 Not far enough, 




 The initial story showed a homeless guy being sent to Sacramento, CA.  In the follow-up story, it showed him now living with his sister in Sacramento which is a better option than staying in a mental health hospital.  He literally was sent to family. 




 Not really. 




 I know, a California for-profit hospital. 




 wow. 




 Yes, and state employees have taken about a 20% pay and benefit cut in the last 4 years, and it doesn't look like the legislature will do anything to help it in the next two years.  State employees were already lowest on the totem pole with city and county workers. 




 I watched Anthony Bourdain there last night on CNN. I've been dreaming about it all day.  Then I see your photos.  Great pics! 




 Good for this boy.  When I saw the article title, I was hoping it was the young boy was was abducted by the Chinese as he was identified as being the next Dali Lama.   




 Partly it's like crying wolf.  We're tired of hearing of their continual outrage over something - anything.  I think Obama's right on this one:  there is no there there. 




 The NAACP was singled out; I just didn't hear about it until this week. 




 You're right.  It drives me crazy.  I've talked with some of these folks.  They are entitled, it's the other ones who are scamming the system.  It's insane. 




 The intent was different too.  Nixon saw it as a way to get rid of the bureaucracy. 




 You make good points and I do worry about Dems a lot too.  But,  the parties are not comparable in craziness.   




 I would just tax the Walton family since they earn 40% of all income in a year in the US.  Taxes used to be 90% in the US in the 50's ; 83% in England in 1980.  If it keeps going the way it is, no one will have any income at all to shop at Wal-Mart. 




 Thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  I saw a book on c-span today that was addressing these very issues...http://www.truth-out.org/article/item/1388:gar-alperovitz-the-prehistory-of-the-next-possible-progressive-era
This is a Truthout article on his book and thoughts about the subject.  He was talking today about coops, but he said long term we need to define the type of democracy we want. 




 No necessarily, but you you would have the freedom to find your purpose without having to worry about the necessities.   




 Exactly.  I don't think we have a choice. 




 There is an old town in Nevada also -  St. Thomas - that was covered during the filling of Lake Mead that is now being exposed. 




 Depressing huh? 




 That was what Cheney said. 




 When did you win your Nobel prize for economics? 




 It seems hopeless. 




 Good summation. 




 I can't believe she is still around and given credibility by the right.  I see her occassionally on C-Span.  Amazing. 




 You are not paying close enough attention.  I rarely hear Dems make the crazy type of statements that you hear 10 times a day from Republicans.  Check this article out that I just saw on reddit http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dz4tl
or listen to Rachel on MSNBC.  Is she biased?  You bet.  But she can back her stuff up with facts. 




 I just made a comment on another article about thier craziness is that we need to treat them as a cult and de-program them.  Then I see this article.... 




 We need to start treating them as a cult, and that they members need to be de-programed. 




 It's not too new.  It was proposed by Nixon. 




 I wish we could vote these guys out, but we can't seem to do it.
 




 I like Bugliosi, but Thom Hartmann has a good book which makes a strong case for the mafia. 









 Close.  Charleston and Main.  I don't remember anyone swimming it it though!  Great photo. 




 I've never heard of this university. 









 Thank you for your thoughtful response.  We read too little of this. 




 This link needs to be made in the science subreddit.  People there might be as interested as us. 




 I wasn't making reference to you. 




 I'm at the same place you are.  It's tough to live like this.  I don't know how people do it.  We can't give up though. 




 Wow. Thanks for the post. And since I missed the previous post, I'm glad you did this.
