 No. The only two episodes that I know of that Gail the Snail is in are The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention and the last episodes of season 9, which is I think The Gang Squashes Their Beefs. She first appeared in season 5. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is in season 2 I think. 




 No that's The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is the one where Mac bangs Dennis' mom and then Dennis tries to sleep with all the moms to retaliate. 




 I have some personal favorites but I'm a die-hard fan and I tend to like even the ones that no one enjoys but these episodes are what I always hear from my friends.
1. The Gang Dances Their Asses Off
2. Dennis and Dee Go On Welfare
3. Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom 




 He does this thing where like, he doesn't exist. It's hilarious you have to be there to get it. 




 Beavis and Butthead. Imagine Butthead commenting on the video for Wrecking Ball 




 LOST. 




 It's the coolest thing, ever. 




 No because I overeat for the most part. And this is assuming I live in a country where a large number of people are hungry so it's not like transporting the food is an issue.
