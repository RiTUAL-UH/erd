 I'm not certain. I'll see what I can find when I get home and I'll PM you the details 




 You could always move to Switzerland :P 




 Am I the only one bothered by the fact that the stanchions and lifelines are flat on the deck?

 I'm here to offer knowledge about the US Coast Guard :)

 It's a train car... of beer. 









 That was fantastic! 




 lmao. I laughed harder at that than I should have. 




 So let it goooooo!!!! 




 Clearly not!  




 I know ours (USCG) harkens back to the days of the Revenue Cutter Service. I pulled this from [uscg.mil](http://www.uscg.mil):

The Revenue Marine and the Revenue Cutter Service , as it was known variously throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as cutters.  The term is English in origin and refers to a specific type of vessel, namely, "a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail." (Peter Kemp, editor, The Oxford Companion to Ships   the Sea; London: Oxford University Press, 1976; pp. 221-222.)   The Royal Navy's definition of a cutter was a small warship capable of carrying 8 to 12 cannons.*** 

By general usage, the term cutter came to define any vessel of Great Britain's Royal Customs Service and the term was adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine.  Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its largest vessels as cutters (today a cutter is any Coast Guard vessel over 65-feet in length).

And the little addition as denoted by "***":

***BMC Joseph Noecker, USCG (Ret.) in an email to the Historian's Office, noted: ". . .cutters in the British man-of-war designations had 8 to 12 guns/cannon. . . Hull numbers [were] one way of calling a ship via radio.  Much the same as an aircrafts' tail number is used today.  By international agreement all U.S. radio call signs begin with A, K, N or W.  Army (and later Air Force) used A, Navy and private aircraft use N.  That, among other reasonings, may have been the reason for the W."

 It's all good. Still an amazing game. 




 Indeed! 




 Cards Against Humanity with all possible expansions and packs. It offers so much in the way of variety and usually leaves people [in stitches](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/in+stitches). 




 Jenny? 




 Or the Emperor let himself go! 




 I was watching The Living Daylights (James Bond Film) and she was featured in the opening scene. 









 I love what you've done to abuniverse! This is an incredible transformation and I can't wait to place some orders in the future!     




 I keep mine well trimmed. I don't like shaving as it itches like mad a day after. I use the sideburn bit on my electric razor to trim everything. I will shave my balls with shaving cream and a razor in the shower though. 




 I readjust and tuck it downwards a bit. I also usually wet my diaper shortly thereafter and it helps reduce said boner. 




 Those look amazing! I felt myself starting to slip into littlespace just looking at them! WANT!

Also, you're rather adorable in your Snuggies XD 




 Here's a thread about them: http://defence.pk/threads/ccg-2901-and-ccg-2501.346531/.

Former Coastie here and I love seeing various Coast Guard (or Coastguard) ships of the world. 




 The internal politics of the management. My manager doesn't answer to any of the GMs in the area, but they don't like him. So they take it out on us.  




 They sort of remind me of Gremlins...
