 But don't call it a "default."

Under Gov. Walker, Wisconsin went from a $760M surplus in 2013 to a $283M deficit this coming year. 









 Awesome, this was the explanation I was seeking. 




 Does the spherical or squared off ends indicate one type over another? 




 I see rectangular ones rounded ones with square ends, and tubular ones with square ends. The rectangular ones obviously carry dry goods but what about the other ones? 




 That's like saying brain surgeons are better than heart surgeons. Each of the racing sports are quite separate disciplines though they use much of the same principles. Rallye is fantastic and the drivers are challenged by very different conditions and have to interact with their navigator but they race against the clock. In F1, precision is key and the variation comes in having to adapt the best line to react to what the other drivers immediately around you are doing. 

Whichever they race, it takes thousands of hours of practice in that discipline to be competitive. Mika Hakkinen has been racing on a track since he was a kid, starting with kart racing. 




 Hey, welcome to adulthood! 




 Aww, you're so C*_6_*H*_12_*O*_6_*. 




 Fair nuff. 




 I didn't start it. Read over the damn thread.

One thing my father taught me, and I'll teach you now:  Don't throw the first punch, but throw the second punch with everything you got.

Now, go be a man. 




 Hey fag, read this:  The minimum practical application range for salt is a pavement temperature of 15-20F and above.

You seriously are an idiot. Do you want the phone numbers for the Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado departments of transportation?

Christ, why do I put up with idiots? 




 Here's a google of ['road salt temperature'](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=road%20salt%20temperature). Read Google's answer. No DOT will dump tons of road salt at -6F just to watch it take hours and hours to turn it to slush which will re-freeze during the next precip. 




 If the high was only 0 Fahrenheit, salt can't be used because it's not effective. They use sand at that point. 




 Hydraulic fluid is used in control systems much like brake cables on your bicycle. Instead of cables, hydraulic fluid is used. When you push on the brakes in your car, the brake lines filled with hydraulic fluid transmits that pressure to the brake calipers at the wheel.

Hydraulic fluid can leak, causing you to lose pressure. Or you can get air bubbles in the hoses. Air is very compressible so it absorbs the pressure and makes the hydraulic system less effective. Hydraulic fluid also absorbs water. If enough is absorbed, the metal parts of the system begin to rust and can stick or bind. 




 Water is fairly transparent in the visible spectrum of light but it loves UV and absorbs lots of it. It absorbs UV at 10X visible wavelengths, if I recall. On a clear cold day there isn't as much water in the air absorbing the UV so more reaches the ground where it can get absorbed by the water on the surface. That water reaches a higher energy state and vaporizes. 




 Just because you have a 6 Mbps dsl speed on your copper line doesn't mean you are actually getting that. You are sharing the connection with your neighbors. Also, your download and upload speeds are very different. With a T1, you get the full 1.5Mbps, both up and down.

The price is high because typically a T1/PRI is leased to a customer who absolutely needs guaranteed capacity and reliability. 




 Cancer cells grow and divide rapidly. It takes a lot of fuel to do that. Cancer cells literally starve you, or rather they starve your good cells where the cancer is growing. If/when the cancer metastasizes and starts spreading, your body slowly shuts down as the cells that perform vital functions die. You don't die from cancer, you die from liver failure, heart failure, starvation, etc. 




 Coding a new crowd-sourced micro-loan website focused on clean water, skill building and giving matriarchs of sub-sahara african tribal families the economic opportunities to create sustainable small businesses. And doing it in Ruby on Rails.

Just kidding. I'm on reddit. 




 Lie detectors should probably be called truth detectors. They're better at detecting who is telling the truth than who is telling lies. 




 This is where economics textbooks let you down, my friend. L.L. Bean has been around for over 100 years. If they want to be around another 100 years then it's not good PR to raise your prices during massive winter storms.  




 Insurance companies are providing a service and taking on risk. Why shouldn't they be profitable? If insurance companies can be profitable while helping slow the rise of health care costs then isn't that good? They are private corporations that are competing against each other so hopefully they are being forced to constantly strive to provide better service at lower cost. They are also a force that helps control cost increases from pharmaceutical, medical equipment companies, doctors and hospitals that also want to be profitable. In my state there are also options from an ACA-marketplace insurance provider that is a non-profit. County health services are taxpayer funded and have no competition. They get the same budget regardless of how well they're meeting the needs of the community. I have a problem with that. 

It's certainly a complex issue but what we were doing hasn't been working too well. The idea of the ACA has been around for a long time and I'm willing to see if it produces results. 




 When you reach 65 or older, medicare becomes available for you. 




 But it's not limited to life threatening care. It has become the defacto doctor's office visit for everything from colds to head lice and I suspect it is the same for your county's emergency room, regardless of their official policy. These costs are a big burden for hospitals. The ACA has already resulted more people now have insurance than at any other time that the statistic has been measured. This will directly correlate to fewer emergency room visits, more preventive care doctors office visits. 




 The ACA says that insurers can not use pre-existing conditions to determine whether you can be covered and the premium cost. They can use age and whether you are a smoker.  




 Premiums have been going up by a lot every single year. For example, between 2009 and 2010--this is prior to the ACA rollout--the national average increase was 6.5%.

Under the ACA the premium increases between 2014 and 2015 were net zero nationally. Some states saw increases, other states saw decreases.

 You benefit from the same totalitarian government which has mandated to health care providers that if you visit the emergency room, they must provide life-saving care to you regardless of your ability to pay. This is health care that is not free. In fact, it's quite expensive and somebody has to pay for it.

How do you feel about that mandate? 




 Like everything else, currency responds to supply and demand.  




 Tighter winding produces bulkier cable and uses more copper. Copper is very costly right now. Plus, to be truly Cat6, the installer needs to terminate with shielded connectors and use shielded patch panels, which are costly and time consuming. 




 The list is just how I think money should be allocated. I'd rather take $50 from the money spent on skis to buy a $75 pair of gloves instead of a $25 pair.

Growing up, my fingers were practically frostbitten on some days. Now that I have some disposable income, I splurge on gloves and I find that it helps me stay more comfortable so I can ski longer and get more enjoyment.  




 Because they want to be the next place where Microsoft and Comcast builds tech support call centers. 




 Batteries, motor and magnet in the handle. 




 It's not meant to be the order that you buy things, but the relative importance you should consider when allocating how much money to spend on each thing. Splurge on things at the top of the list, at the expense of things at the bottom. 




 Except that if you're in the states you can't buy a new Defender. The 20 year old used ones go for minimum $25K. 




 The Series I/II/III are in the direct lineage leading to the Defender 90/110. 




 Wow. I did not know this. When it is resurrected next year I'm sure it won't be the same. 




 Your skis respond to the input from your legs and feet. If your feet move around inside your boot, it can't properly control your skis. You'll be wasting a lot of energy trying to control skis that are wandering. On steeper runs, things happen faster and there's less room for mistakes. In bumps and crud it's absolutely critical that you can instantly adjust your skis to the varying terrain. 




 I don't disagree with you at all. I ride motorcycles, bike and ski, always with a helmet. A lot of people think helmets reduce concussions but there just isn't much evidence to support that. I think it's important people know the limitations of the helmet. 




 That's a football study regarding a certain design. That design may eventually make it into snow sports but I'm talking about the recent evidence on ski helmets that are in use today.

Here's one:
The helmet does a very good job at protecting against skull lacerations and skull fractures, but it doesnt seem to have much effect on concussions or T.B.I.s, Shealy said, referring to traumatic brain injuries. Jasper Shealy, a professor emeritus at Rochester Institute of Technology, has been studying snow-sports-related injuries at Sugarbush resort in Vermont for more than 30 years.

From a recent [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/sports/on-slopes-rise-in-helmet-use-but-no-decline-in-brain-injuries.html). 




 That's pretty awesome DIY waterproofing 




 Where does grass fit on this list? 




 Yeah definitely, and I can't imagine skiing without one now. Helmets prevent a lot of kinds of head injuries but statistically they don't reduce the chance of concussions. :( 




 Patrollers still wear overalls but it seems to have fallen out of favor with everyone else. 




 Oh my hell. 




 A fitter can put some bolsters around your ankle area to get a tighter grip, or you can go with Intuition liners. That's really important! How the hell are you able to ski bumps if your heel is lifting in your boots???!!!!? 




 Part of enjoying what you do is feeling good when you're doing it. Foot complaints are probably #1 and it really holds people back from enjoying skiing. I think it's one of the reasons snowboarding has taken off. If you're starting out and know that you like skiing, invest in good boots that are appropriate for your level and get the liners fitted. You can even move some liners to new boots as you get better, as long as they aren't too compressed. Footbeds are also important if you have weird arches like I do. 




 I don't disagree with that. You should spend more than $20 on goggles but honestly I don't see (literally) much difference between $50 and $150 other than $150 buys you some sweet looking ones. I just put them below jacket because I think it's important to have a nice weatherproof shell with adjustable ventilation to handle lots of different changes in condition. But goggles could easily go above the shell. 




 Helmets don't do anything to prevent concussions. If you were going to get one you would have gotten one, helmet or not. It saved you from a nasty contusion, likely. 




 People's priorities are way off when it comes to where the money goes for ski equipment. 

Common priorities:

1. Jacket/Pants
2. Goggles
3. Skis
4. Gloves
5. Boots

It should be:

1. Boots
2. Gloves
3. Skis
4. Jacket/Pants
5. Goggles

With shitty skis and great fitting boots you can still ski anything. With great skis and shitty fitting boots, you won't be able to ski anything more than blue. 




 If you're talking about dealerships, a lot of their customers are repeat buyers who have developed a trusted relationship. I can walk into my Ducati dealership and test ride a $25,000 motorcycle. 




 Exercise strengthens bones by placing more stress on them. Asians typically walk a lot more than Americans. 




 The first computers had a very small amount of code called a bootstrapper that looked for software from an input/output device such as a punch card reader and load that directly into memory and start performing the loaded instructions. Thus the operating system could be coded into those punch cards. 




 There are only a few species that we know of which are self-aware like humans. The common test is the mirror test, where an odorless colored dot is placed somewhere they can't see on themselves but can in a mirror. A self-aware animal will react differently in the presence of the dot than without it.

Dogs and cats don't show much signs of being self-aware and I suppose that extends to their shadows. 




 Where does pillow appear on Maszlow's hierarchy? 




 There are a lot of reasons for them to--air pollution, especially in-cabin pollution to name one--but it's government. There is no incentive for government bureaucrats to update their bus design requirements and huge disincentives not to. In other words, nobody in government has ever lost their job by maintaining the status quo, no matter how ineffective and inefficient it is. 




 I'm not sure it so much crappy design as a necessary design. I'd hate to have my shirt pocket get filled with ink. Perhaps it's an unsolvable design problem?

 I am a business owner. I had an employee tell me that he saw a friend with a flat tire on the freeway and pulled over to help her change it because he had my floor jack in his car (which he had borrowed from me a few months prior).

 Most people know not to throw paper towels, tampons and pads into the toilet so it's not a big issue. These "flushable" wipes are marketed as being toilet-disposable. It's a godsend for parents. I'm guilty. Unfortunately, I now know they do not break down as easily as toilet paper. It's a major problem, especially in areas with older waste treatment facilities. I think you'll eventually see that term banned from their packaging unless the companies actually make them more degradable. 









 To get a sense of what is going to happen under extreme drought conditions, you can look at what is going on in Syria. In only 5 years of severe drought, from 2006 to 2011, millions of Syrians who subsist on farming lost close to 100% of their crops. This drove millions into the cities for work, creating social stress and unrest. Combine that with an oppressive regime and you get conditions that create groups like ISIS which has threatened the fragile region.

 Pull enough length to slice across the entire diameter of the cake. After slicing, pull the line out of the cake horizontally, not up. Don't reuse that length. Use new fishing line for the next cut, and so on. This keeps each cut completely perfect. 









 Yeah, hard to condense a book down to one paragraph. :)

The reason why I included all the other things is because Diamond's premise is that they were sequential events. There is a lot more as well, domestication of animals as a reliable source of protein was huge. A population density high enough for rapid sharing of innovations, abundant sources of fresh water and water routes for trade, etc. But of course other cultures had that too. Europe was unique in that all of those things occurred on one continent. 




 Jared Diamond wrote a fantastic book about this called "Guns, Germs and Steel." 

Basically:  Europe was a wide continent (more latitude than longitude), which is important when you're dealing with climate and agriculture. As humans migrated across latitude they can bring the same seeds and make the same crops. This helped them succeed quickly. They made a lot of war, which led to a lot of innovation such as bronze and steel, maritime, etc. They endured a lot of disease and pestilence which allowed them to become fairly immune and carry disease to the Americas which wiped out the natives. 




 It came from a story about Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt. He was on a hunting trip and as was customary, chasers cornered and tied up a bear to a tree for Roosevelt to shoot. Roosevelt said it was unsportsmanlike and didn't shoot the bear. Word spread around and a toy company made a stuffed toy bear. It became a very popular toy because of the popularity of the story.

 So what did your President do when he understood the toll that violent fanaticism took on individual lives? He used that sentiment to start a war that destroyed a country which had absolutely nothing to do with that attack and he did it with all of the support of the American Congress and the citizens.

Perhaps the point is belabored to you but I doubt most Americans have any idea what is going on outside their own city, let alone the world. This memorialization is trivial. Aside from the rescue personnel, what did the rest of the 3,000 people do that day? They went to work. The fact that they had no control over when and how they died is not a reason to spend vast amounts of money, time and resources to memorialize them. These 3,000 deaths is just as tragic as all of the innocent deaths in Iraq that resulted from American imperialism--deaths that still happen daily. People in Iraq die while going to work, every day. They get blown up and they leave behind survivors who grieve just as much as you Americans. Does any American give a shit? Not a single synapse in the United States is wasted on such a thought. The only time American fuck would be given is if a dollar could be earned doing so. American aid? For every $100 sent to Iraq, $95 came back to the United States in the form of lucrative contracts. Murica! Fuck Yeah! Your politicians build these memorials that you can bow to so it's easier for them to fuck you up the ass.

Not only is this memorial trivial, it's dangerous. You Americans have a history of using such memorials to launch wars, not only in 2012 but you also had "Remember the Alamo," used to launch an imperial expansionist land-grab war against Mexico. The world doesn't trust America and there shall be no apology offered for that.

Lastly, the fact that you Americans want to memorialize people who merely went to the office is the sort of American exceptionalism that people elsewhere find particular disgust in. If you check the pinterest and twitter streams around the world I bet you'll find a lot of photos of foreigners at this memorial giving the ol' thumbs up. 




 It sounds like you suddenly realized the answer. Congratulations. 




 You've hit the question that is at the heart of the matter. Why is government needed as the foundation of capitalism? What is the weakness of capitalism that you need government to correct? If you answer that question then you have answered OP. 




 There are 300,000 to 1,000,000 additional victims of 9/11 in Iraq that the New York Times forgot about. 




 Yikes! 




 Metal doesn't fatigue and weaken unless flexed beyond a certain limit. If the aircraft is well designed and you don't fly through extreme storm conditions, it can fly a really long time with regular maintenance. 




 Bacteria will turn milk bad very quickly at room temps. Cheese and yogurt is "bad" milk that we humans love. We introduce certain bacteria that produce flavors we like. They consume the lactose sugars before the bad bacteria has a chance to, and they often create acidic environments that inhibit that bad bacteria in the first place.

Meringue is egg white. I believe that bacteria feed mostly on the yolk so by taking the yolk out, the meringue has a longer room temp life. Not sure on this. 




 Why have government? 




 it wasn't meant to be a comprehensive history textbook. It was meant to show that there is another side to the story. Growing up in the United States and studying within the public school curriculum up through high school, you won't ever see "the other side." Zinn obviously meant for his book to prod people to question rather than accept. That's the kind of growth that college also provides to young adults. 




 I surely hope you don't think hypothetical questions are irrelevant. Political philosophers throughout the written history of mankind have been discussing hypothetical and unreal forms of government. I'm sorry if you don't see the value in doing so.

Regardless, I was addressing "freedom therefore capitalism." My point is that you don't want the kind of pure capitalism that would appear in a completely free state. There are problems in pure capitalism that must be redressed through creating a regulated competitive market and governed by an authority to which we give power to punish. No regulatory body will be perfect because there will never be a set of regulations that are perfect. Regulations, by their nature, are restrictions of freedom which we grudgingly accept to varying degrees. They will hurt some and help others.

jefferey1313 accepts both premises--pure capitalism has problems, government regulations have problems--but could not accept the conclusion that the system isn't perfect. The only way he can do that is by believing that there is a set of perfect regulations that can be administered by a perfectly functional governing body.

TL;DR: Is capitalism problem-free? On one extreme, pure capitalism  isn't desired by most people. So we agree there are problems. Now it's just a matter of drawing the line to balance regulation and liberty. 




 And around in a circle we go. You conveniently want to avoid talking about true freedom in an unregulated capitalist market, then you say that such a thing would cure the patent issue. Are you trying to have it both ways?

Do you want regulated competition? That means government.

Do you want unregulated capitalism? That's freedom, my friend. But that also means that if you come up with a better mouse trap, somebody (somebody with, say, more capital) can copy it and put you out of business tomorrow.

My point is this.  Your conundrum illustrates this weakness of capitalism:  An unregulated market will foster unfair competition. Regulated competition will restrict capitalism. 




 I guess I got caught up on the "freedom" part.

Anyways, I think you can give more credit to some people, maybe not all, but at least some. There is a /r/TIL today that discussed how Albuterol--an old asthma drug--was repatented and now costs over $100 per inhaler. Before, it was $15.

People also have issues with corporate greed trumping civility. Enron is a good example. Their tactics of purchasing a small amount of electricity allocation then reselling it back to localities at astronomical prices when the system was maxxed out and there were rolling blackouts was considered to be the ultimate in greed. Their tactics forced the electricity utilities to cut power in the middle of summer, raise prices sky high, forcing some people to choose between dying from heat exposure or not eating. 

Wealth is a great motivator. Nobody denies that. Bu there are also many examples of greedy, anti-social behavior due to capitalism.
