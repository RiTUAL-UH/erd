 well, the Union aren't doing so well. I could switch the captain choice. Who should I pick?

 Have economists explained the benefits and cons of the TPP? I really want to know since obviously most economists would say that TPP is a good thing economically. 




 I use Bing.

 You can look in the conservative mindset and think "Why is this Kansas's Governor doing the thing for the benefit of conservatives?" and for what reason? 




 Just pretending to be a conservative 




 Thanks for the help! :D I didn't know how to do that as well. 




 I am assuming this will encourage people to attend private schools or get vouchers or go to charter schools to get "better" eduction, right? Also, it will prevent public unions from stealing taxpayer money? 




 Isn't this bribery?  




 I forgot to include imports of slave labor and natural resources, but mainly we produced our own texiles from cotton grown in the south and produced manufacturing up in the north.  




 You do realize the USA was a protectionist country up until WW2. The Republican Party used to support heavy tariffs and the Democratic Party used to support reduced tariffs. Our growth in capital resulted from the education system and innovation by Americans with some access to knowledge from European technology.  




 I think Konami might make that rule change sometime in the future to promote new dueling tactics. After all, GX characters followed that concept.  




 What are the economists thoughts on the trans pacific partnership? 




 Politics And ideologies can be ironic. Example: conservatives pro global trade yet nationalist. How?

 This is what happens with citizens United and a first past the post voting susten 




 Revenues naturally increase due to population growth. 




 Foreign Companies are growing the nations to serve their objective and sell them for the benefit of other countries. The goods produced aren't really used by the people in Africa themselves. They can use some of their wages to purchase some of the goods, but there isn't the full gains of trade. This method will take a long time for countries to actually develop into developed countries, but it still works. Hence, why the world's economy gets better each day throughout human history. It just depends on the rate of growth. 




 But... Protectionism is bad economic policy, right? According to simple economics, protectionism prevents competition, does not increase welfare, and doesn't improve the lives relative to when a country actually trades. 




 Roids 




 There is a video segment on Vice New's YouTube channel that looks into the pipeline industry's self regulation and the government's inability to regulate them. 




 Revenues will be increasing in the future due to the tax cuts ;)

Praise the Laffer Curve! 




 He isn't really overrated....

 You have 3 fusion sages and 3 poly? Fusion sage is basically an upstart..... 




 It is understandable from an economist point of view. Another interesting look is how free-trade functions between China and Hong Kong.

There are similaritities between how they interact and how the US interacts with other countries. 




 I agree with the top point. Anything can cause a recession or depression, while policies are enacted in the extremes in a short period of time. 

For the second point, Are you suggesting that current path of America's trade policy should continue without any reforms or changes? 




 America built an economy up until World War 2 with heavy tariffs, growing unions, and lots of exports. 

You can argue on either end of the spectrum. It seems like the problem is the trade deficit. It is not protectionism vs free-trade. A little more protectionism could reduce the deficit and in return increase exports. 




 America was a protectionist country until World War 2. During that time, we built an incredible economy. Not saying alll free-trade and protectionism is bad, but some protectionism and some trade is good.  




 The whole irony is that while we debate whether burger flippers are worth $15, we seem to believe that manufacturing labor should be worth less than $1 because without it.....most of our goods would be more expensive.  




 Colorado's Defense does better when O'Neill and Moor are on the field. 




 Should people transfer out David Villa for BWP/Keane/Zardes/Wondolowski/Torres or Saborio in anticipation of round 8 and maybe round 9?  




 Ahh... the ignorant traditionalist Americans again... 




 Hm... I got Sam for this week..... but.... Should I also get Felipe? 




 I am glad that I captained Jacobson. lol 




 How exactly do we debunk the claims that free-trade always good for the economy from most economists?   




 roid cards if any :) 




 Oh the puns.... 




 There is some evidence, but it is still a theory. This is economics. You can't go far to extreme on either end. Also it is possible to shift demand and supply to get some outcomes. 




 A fully automated society will probably need basic income.  




 The minimum wage is still a price floor though. You could raise it to $15 min wage and reduce the labor supply and it wouldn't really create a lot of deadweight loss of the demand is inelastic. demand for labor is inelastic when businesses have to take the market wage and can't automate as quickly. 




 Small Businesses will probably take the new labor market wage because they can't buy capital initially because it would be too expensive to automate. 




 Raising the minimum wage still doesn't address the issue of why companies are making so much money off of an uncompetitive markets. they will continue outsourcing and automating these jobs. They will do in a faster rate if we do raise it now. 




 Anarchy! Because minorities should always rebel on majority rules. No. You face off in a court system. 




 Wouldn't it makes sense to reduce outsourcing incentivized first and increase competition in the markets so companies don't get as much profit to automate as quickly. Since we have an increase in small businesses, those businesses can't buy capital as fast as big businesses. Also a reduction in the labor supply by reducing the amount of new immigrant labor and an increase in unionization would push up wages as well. These should all go into effect before the min wage actually increases. 




 It will eventually balance out. Once western conference players hit the transfer market, they will most likely go to eastern conference. 




 if all nations abolished trade barriers, would all the world prices be at equilibrium? 




 When are we going to debate the merits of this on the media? 




 I would go with Kamara, since Agudelo could sometimes not start, since Charlie Davis is a good sub at the moment.  




 LOL It meant it has 2 letter ds 




 it is a sandwich  




 i can't make it pass the 5th episode but I you like yugioh a lot, it is a good extra series to watch. A bonus is hat the main character isn't dominant so it is unique in its own way. 




 yes. if you haven't watched it, it is one of the best. 




 I say yes, if you are getting rid of him long term.

 Not exactly. In Canada and UK, they have first past the post system with many parties. It is just that power is centralized to Parliament with proportion and majority rules that encourages more parties, but there is still the spoiler effect. 




 Mostly due to the fact that we allowed politicians to accept free-trade deals with countries not on similar living standards as us. 




 My defense is Hernandez (NYCFC), Harrington, and Ramos. Midfielders are Ishizaki, Sam, Jacobson, and Finlay. Forwards are Arrieta, Villa, and Rivero. I am leaning on Ousted because it wouldn't make sense to have Arrieta and Deric starting. 

Bench: Villarreal, Sjoberg 




 I say yes, if you have DGW players on your starting lineup. DGW players will probably make up the difference of -4. 




 Cardcar D 




 Nekroz is so weak. 




 Why would people captain defenders if one goal by the opposing team cause no clean sheets and defenders don't have manny opportunities to score goals? 




 Fluffals 




 Both have the same outcome, but I would say swinging strikes is better. Called strikes is basically a batter trying to get a ball or just confused by the pitch. swinging strikes are basically batter knowing where to hit but the pitch had some movement. Fouling balls for strikes is better than both.  




 Statistics are part of sports. All major sports teams use them. 




 Why do they have 2 performapals for vote? Are they trying to split the vote? DDD? The tcg has no support for it, so why do we need it? Beast eyes and Tiger are good for a vote.  




 Yugioh wouldn't be around much if people don't get access or have the chance to play decks. More competition = the better the community and support for the game as a whole. 




 The only viable way of using roids is mixing them with cybers, machinas, and rank 4s at the moment.  




 YES! ROID SUPPORT! 




 I would say that Montreal need a better goalkeeping than defenders. Though, the defense could be better. 




 Don't forget Shane O'Neill 




 That changes deck builds if people are unwilling to have 3 upstarts  




 Yet conservatives keep promoting that mass transit riders must pay more in fares to find the systems. 




 pot of greed 




 Imagine the traffic if all of those were shut down due to low funds. 




 Even small town USA needs the trains to deliver goods to other places and highways to get places. 




 Shouldn't John Boehner have found the money by now for transportation and the Highway Trust Fund? Reference: John Oliver :) 




 today's meta has so many cards on the field that I think mirror force outclasses dprison. 




 Why not? A strong military means a strong AMERICA! 




 Double standard much? :)

 Since protection of national security is important, we should make it mandatory for all citizens to be in the army like how Switzerland does it. :) 




 Yes. By the way, I am left-leaning in politics.  




 Wouldn't the easiest solution be making college mandatory for all the citizens if it is so "important"? 




 if Rivero says he has some injury, then I guess morales. Though, morales could get some yellow or red card.... Ouch..... 




 I could try that because finlay might not start 2 games but it is worth the shot. 




 I wanted to transfer out Neagle because he price dropped by $0.1 and he hasn't produced as I wanted since the beginning of the season. Molino is also in the same category as Neagle. You recommend transferring in a good defender over a midfielder?  




 Starting:

Goalkeeper: Ousted

Defenders: Ramos(Orlando), Opara(SKC), Harrington (COL)

Midfielders: Ishizaki(LA), Jacobson(NYCFC), Neagle(SEA), Morales(VAN), Molino(Orlando)

Forwards:
Villa(NYCFC), Rivero(VAN)

Bench: Deric, Arrieta, Villarreal, Bedell, Peay, Robinson
 




 Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.  

In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.  




 He leans more socialist than the rest because he wants a single-payer healthcare system.  




 Steve Grossman was the best candidate. he isn't martha and he isn't too socialist like Berwick. 




 Remember the section on the gas tax. The easiest solution is raising the gas tax but people are against it in its full concept because they want really cheap gas prices. 




 Because Baker and the State House Would have cut even more spending without raising any taxes to balance the budget.  




 the repeal of the auto tax increase basically decreased the MBTA's expected future revenues by a few % points and some millions. 




 The easiest fix would be raising the gas tax. It will #1 fund road repairs and other infrastructure needs. #2 discourage excessive driving, so more riders will ride the T for more revenues.  




 I usually go on Saturdays. :) 




 Well, Steve Clark, Parkhurst, Pogatetz, Grana, and Finlay have played mroe than 200 minutes, so they are safe bets. If I had to chose a player, it would be Finlay because he has done well last season. You could do Steve Clark, but people are hoping on Vancouevr attack to do well, so it might backfire.  




 We need more political parties ranging from the fringes to the moderates to the libertarians to the populists.  




 Hitters have been taking drugs since the beginning of baseball.  




 Imagine Montreal vs Toronto or Boston or New York? 




 I recommend getting qliphorts sooner or later because the prices are falling and have the potential to rebound if the meta still allows them to function. 




 If they are working under the table for cash, then they are "working" techically to live a life instead of soly relying on welfare. Of course, these are Americans working under the table, yet somehow illegal immigrants can't work under the table for cash. 




 You do realize that strikeout rates have increased, game time length has increased, less homeruns, less hits, etc has been happening since the past 2 decades. We had more runs/homeruns/hits per game and shorter game length 2+ decades ago, so something needs to be addressed.  




 The easiest option is to buy players from teams with DGW. They will score more points than the average, so their price should rise. Then, you can resell them in the next round.
