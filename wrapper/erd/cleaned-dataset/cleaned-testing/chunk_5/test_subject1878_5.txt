 Yeah, whenever I hear/see Irrawaddy I hear Kahn's chant.  




 Lol, not sure how "one" became "joke" but oh well. 

And it's a King of the Hill reference. 




 Yay! I was worried no joke would get the reference... 


















































































































 Because it gives the reader the context as to why this is an important study? 

If there weren't a concerted effort to push a false narrative that warming stopped, then a study showing otherwise wouldn't have any relevance.  




 A scientist should hope that people stop saying something that's incorrect. 

Right? Or do you think they should be happy about misinformation and the repetition of debunked myths? 




 ...did you really just use the "it's cold where I am right now, therefore global warming isn't real" argument? 
 




 Yeah maybe just don't be a pedant. 

I work with climate scientists on a daily basis. They use the terms interchangeably unless referring to specific issues. 

And regardless, editors, not scientists, write headlines. 
 




 But then it appears as if someone's been quoted, not that it's just part of the article. Personal opinion isn't ever allowed, so I don't see why people would think it's that and not a quote from the story, which is standard practice... 




 Scientists shouldn't hope that false things aren't repeated?  














 Yeah, my fanboys are dedicated.  












































 It's not my opinion, it's the conclusion of the coverage, and it provides the context as to why the research is important. Rebutting false hypotheses is a core part of science, isn't it?

 haha yeah I guess.

I mean, no, I did it on purpose to make it shittier.  




 wut u sayin bout me mum?  




 I've found that their stuff with moving parts (like a dresser) doesn't hold up, but the bigger stuff like bookcases and TV stands do. I've had an Ikea bookcase since 2006 that's still going strong! 




 Because it's only fair that those who create the problem help those that didn't? 

They're referring to adapting to the changes, not reducing emissions from developing nations.

Sorry, I saw it cited it by name and journal, forgot to grab the link when I got out of the subway 




 /r/reversedgifs: never not amusing.  




 Since when are subsidies and tax credits not policy?! Are there some sort of non-taxpayer subsidies being discussed here?? 




 The part about the billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies? And tax credits? Development plans and tax revenue for governments? Government contracts? Pretty much the whole thing, if you actually read it.  




 No, it's like blaming the manufacturers.

 Yes, I know technically dinosaurs evolved into birds, but they didn't survive in trees and they aren't still dinosaurs so don't give me any of that "this post is correct" nonsense!

 Now THAT is a manly orange patch! 




 Yes, and anatomy.  




 Lol nice (though probably doesn't need to be said twice!)  




 They're very rare though, as male badgers have a habit of consuming their mate post-coitus.

 Sometimes the easy jokes are the best!  




 Seriously, I have little patience for shit talkers, doubly so ones who have never submitted anything... 




 Why not both? 




 Oooh, then /r/ShittyAnimalFactsComments!  




 Considering they can survive a nuclear holocaust, not sure that's a sensible bar to set... 




 I love it when sloths try and say hi!  




 Clearly it's got you concerned! Though I think pigeons will be alright, they're pretty resilient and adaptive.  




 My goal is for wikipedia to one day list "Slowbear" as a colloquial name for sloths. We can do it, reddit!
