 Thank you very much for not making the top half Socially Awesome. 




 Does anyone else eating the filling first and eat the crust later? Just me? 




 Those Mexican Microwaves.... 




 It has been and always will be Biddlers Trick. Such an unsung effect that is perfect in my eyes.

 No she didn't.

 Look... closelier.... 




 "Hold that face... I gotta get my iPhone..." 




 This post was Font-astic.  




 I also use the Aviary iPhone app. 




 One of them? 1/2 of them. 
 




 Thanks for your reply sneaky. I have 3 litter boxes, one in each cage and one for outside pen play. 




 Thank you for your reply! You clean your litter every night? Wow that's new, and something I will consider doing. Currently on a 1.5 week schedule. 




 Thanks for sharing. I'll be right there with you once I get out of this school, man.

 Genius. 









 Not even the Nashville filter can save this one. 




 That's a really funny video! Thank you for sharing, or else I would never have seen it. Looks like I wasn't the first to have this idea... but what ideas are ever original to us? 
Hahaha, getting way too fucking lofty at 4:45AM....  




 Great title.... 




 I respect you. It's so easy sometimes, so cheap.... 









 As a fellow Asian, I imagined this to be more like "My blood type is B+, so you can imagine how pissed off my parents were when they found out." 




 Waited for Bert.... 




 Nice try, Chris Brown. 




 So apparently complimenting girls makes you Socially Awesome now... 




 This is something a lot of parents should be doing all the time that my mother did for me:
My mom is a very popular lady amongst her peers and at her workplace. So, whenever she would take me around her friends, family members I hadn't met yet, or people she ran into at the store, she'd always make sure I fully introduced myself and started even just some small talk with the person(s). Instead of "This is my son Michael" she'd turn to me and say "Michael, would you like to introduce yourself?" Really simple. I'd generally reply with "Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Michael. Shellani's son" to which her friends would usually laugh... haha. It's funny to think about now. But really, I see too many shy ass kids around as kids and as teenagers and adults I deal with every day. Could've benefitted from what I did.  




 Great title. 




 Okay well I'm glad you tried. A nice technique to try when speaking to GR (something you may already have tried) is stating at the end that this really upsets you because you really an innocently messed up then asking if there is anything more they could do for you. I'm sure they'll try to offer another solution, but alternatively I can't say I'd be terribly surprised with the amount of fake claims they receive. Just be genuine and innocent as possible when dealing with GR.   




 Thank you very much for not making the top half "Socially Awesome" 




 I love Basil, but I have no doubt he's gonna fuck that carpet right up. Be careful! :) 




 I am a Cast Member at Disneyland and the NUMBER ONE thing you need to do is email Guest Relations at Disneyland and explain to them your situation. Do not tell them you bought this ticket from some random dude since that's not permitted. You may instead imply that you were gifted it... They will help you out. We work to make sure guests are happy and not to put people SOL.  




 Yeah... that's enough Internet for today. 




 Great title.  









 Pic unrelated... or is it? 




 Instagram makes you make pictures squares though...


Still hot. 




 I work at BTM.
We are closing to first and foremost change the operating system. Right now we run on a computer system currently. We have a pretty sophisticated system, but it requires a lot of upkeep and is rivaled by the system of Indiana Jones, which spaces their vehicles automatically, preventing backups.
Second, because we are already going down for a year, we are taking this time to change the 30+ year old track. Same ride, better track/brake system.
Third, we are extending the exit platform to accommodate more people/wheelchairs. 
Fourth, we are improving show effects and in turn, replacing lost show effects such as potentially the return of the earthquake ending, or I have heard rumor that it may be much different...
Fifth, behind the scenes stuff like adding phone systems to backstage areas and on stage areas that need them.

Hope this helped. 




 At least it wasn't Zach Braff
