 Maybe I have. But yeah it's a pointless question considering the movie isn't out yet 




 I have a feeling the performance will be great, but the movie will get 50/50 reviews. Plus the director isn't known for making Oscar bait films, and if Nightcrawler didn't nab him at least a nomination, i don't  see how this will. 




 Hirsch wasn't nominated for Into the Wild 




 Promiseland was very meh 




 Spot on
 




 We've made quite a few moves improving our defense this off season, which is great, but the only problem is last year, while defense was a major concern, our offense was pretty abysmal. Obviously the team isn't going to be perfected in one off season, plus McCloughan still needs time to gather talent, but barring a breakout from RG3 (please!) were not going very far (which is expected already). 









 So what do you say to somebody you hate? 




 It's a perfectly made film, but an okay movie. 




 I don't know if this counts, but when Bruce Dern finally gets to drive the truck in Nebraska I got pretty emotional. 




 Mom's Spaghetti 




 THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING SAY SO! 




 ....huh well alright 




 I saw both and still wanted Keaton to win, I thought they were both great, but mostly wanted Keaton to win cause he was the only one not based on a real person 




 You got it 




 What the fuck does the Sound of music have to do with anything Oscar related last year. 




 Ummmm 




 Other way around bro 




 A movie that comes to mind is R.I.P.D, Bridges and Reynolds were pretty awful together even though I like both actors. 




 THE PRESIDENT SHALL NOT BE THE SHINIEST OF TWO TURDS 




 And, scene 




 Dolla* 




 I'm so happy for guys and for Brady. Hope your sub welcomes non-patriot fans to celebrate! 




 Russell's next completion is going to be to a Seahawk?
 




 Russell's next completion is going to be to a Patriot 




 I'm interested what the QB situation is going to be. I don't just want RGIII to get the job without showing that he is indeed our best chance at winning. I think he's our best option right now, but if Cousins shows he's the superior option, let him play, if not Rg3 can prove himself. 




 Not his best, but still one of my favorites is The Aviator. Great performance by Leo and defiantly was of his more underrated gems. 









 *peanut butter and jealous 




 Lol......I don't get it

Edit: Fuck maybe I should read the title next time I'm in a thread 




 Andy Serkis was wayyy better in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Lord of the Rings than Dawn, this certainly wasn't the movie to win him the Oscar. 




 Huh I feel there is one more classic movie not on that list..... Speaking of which I could go for some orange juice right about now
