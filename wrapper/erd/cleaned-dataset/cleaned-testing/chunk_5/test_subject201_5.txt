 I think we got them at wal-mart. The brand is Chuck-It. They last forever and are a smaller size so they fit in our small dogs mouths better. You can also get bigger ones. There awesome. They never seem to loose these ones out off all there other toys they have. 




 same here. My two Jacks each have one and they are the only ones still standing. This one is the same way, she will put the ball on any part of my body so she knows I can feel it. She likes to put it up against my lower back when I'm sitting because she knows it drives me crazy and I will keep throwing it. It amazes me how smart this breed is! 




 I'm so happy that she had a positive effect on your evening. They say having a pet (or in this case an adorable picture) can lower stress levels, blood pressure and related illnesses. I hope tomorrow goes smother for you! Deep breaths.. 



















 I actually posted a few picks of splatter from this in the Art Sub. and everyone was so fucking mean to me. Calling me an idiot, gay, my 2 year old can paint better than this. just mean shit. Thanks for the kind words. 




 your pretty close. I try to keep my good gear away from stuff like this so it dosnt get ruined. 




 Never took a video of that. I really should have but the snow is mostly gone where I live and Its back to being a regular bandit again anyways.

 upvote for puppies at the end.
 




 Hes putting in a VW 




 From Plans. I believe its a sonex 2 seater. 




 Yes I believe so. Its come a long way since these pics were taken. I just haven't seen him for awhile. 














 Thats a fuckin samsquamch 




 Maybe that has to do with what kind of opiates you use. I know different types have different itch levels (with me at least). May I ask what you use primarily?  




 That actually sounds like it would do the trick. You have a dog im guessing? or did your teeth itch too one night? 




 I broke my head cherry at a bed bath and beyond... There. I said it. 




 Mines called a bear claw. It puts rolling on the floor and itching your back on a corner to shame. 




 well, I was entertained. 




 Yea for sure. The jeweler that cut it off said to wait a few weeks until her finger is normal again. Then she can have it fixed and sized.  




 That's a great story. Sad she didn't get to wear a ring for so long. That's what my wife's ring is made out of, white gold. Damn that thing was expensive but I love her and I think its her all time favorite thing. She is sad she has to wait a few weeks for the swelling to go down before she can get it fixed and sized. She defiantly couldn't wait 40 years haha.  




 It is REALLY dull but its so dull that it is perfectly flat because its basically been sanded down overtime moving over mirrors. Even with new razors it leaves little streaks where the new razor isn't perfectly flat. 









 I shall name it... The bat razor. Making lines and fighting crimes. 









 Heres an update! We ended up going to the jewely store today. Got the ring cut off professionally and it can now be repaired and sized. [HERES](http://i.imgur.com/72R5CHd.jpg) a pic of the ring. And one of her [FINGER](http://i.imgur.com/VeWTRWW.jpg)

 Who does this 30 minute shipping? Amazon? Are you telling me you can buy stuff online and have it shipped to your house in under and hour? teach me! Tell me! I bet its expensive tho 




 Yea that's what were going to do. Unless the swelling doesn't go down in the next hour I will be taking her to the ER. 




 If they cut the ring off at the ER do you think the ring can still be sized and come out of it looking fine? or does it really screw it up. She has 3 expensive rings soldered together and She wont do anything that will screw up the ring permanently unlessl she was gonna loose a finger or something. Its not bad like that tho.
 




 Well the swelling went down yesterday after we tried just pulling it off with dish soap. The swelling went down that night then tonight we tried the Floss trick and that almost worked but it made her finger swell up even worse. But we will take your advice tho. If it goes numb, looses feeling, or stays swelled we will go to the ER. Thanks for the help! 




 This is actually what caused her finger to swell like it is. We thought the trick looked like it would work awesome but didn't work that great. Now her finger is swelled like in the picture. Were gonna wait to do anything until the swelling goes down 




 We will go to the jewerly store tomorrow and see if they can do it first before I buy a cutter on amazon. Its not like this happens enough to need to own one. Thanks for the info tho! 




 This is what we will most likely end up doing. She needs it re-sized anyway. Her finger has feeling and is fine but thats the kind of advice I wanted. Thanks 




 she is not loosing feeling, we tried yesturday and it got swollen then too.  




 Yea no luck. Its swollen because we tried the trick with dental floss and it didnt work.
