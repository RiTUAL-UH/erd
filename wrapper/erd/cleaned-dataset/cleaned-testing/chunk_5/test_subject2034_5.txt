 Turner Classic Movies screened Soylent Green last night, and I watched it on the DVR this morning. For anyone who has not seen it, it is a dystopian film made in 1973, starring Charlton Heston and in his final performance, Edward G. Robinson. The setting is New York City in 2042, a decaying megalopolis of 40 million impoverished inhabitants, who endure near starvation, heat waves, failing infrastructure and a corrupt leadership. They have so plundered and toxified the planet that the oceans plankton is dying. Those who believe in the Techno-cornucopia have often ridiculed the prophecy of this iconic film. While Manhattan may not resemble this scenario in the coming years, it does seem prescient of the Karachi or Kinshasa of the near future. As in the film, our desperate leaders are herding the worlds peasant farmers into such mega-slums, this being the most expedient means of boosting food production. Their concentration also enhances political control  a rural insurgency has great advantages over an urban one. A claim has emerged that only through intense urbanization can we lower the per capita ecological footprint of humanity, but this is just another cynical, ideological fraud.

And do remember: Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
 




 Back in 1995, Joel E. Cohen, a mathematical biologist, published How Many People Can the Earth Support?, a survey of the estimates for the global carrying capacity of humanity. I recall there were a couple of dozen estimates, ranging from one billion to a hundred billion inhabitants, but that median value was about six billion. That was close to the total population of that time, and it does appear that we have spent the intervening decades in overshoot and may see a dramatic crash in this century. As for the faring into space, I fear that opportunity may have past. I dug old paperback from out from a bookshelf, a 1989 reprint of Gerard K-ONeals The High Frontier, Human Colonies in Space. A physicist at Princeton, ONeal presented a pathway to a self-sustaining space civilization, his answer to the Limits to Growth paradigm. Though his blueprint seemed feasible with the technology of 1976, alas, we can no longer put a man on the moon, and several approaching deadlines may converge before we can recover that capability. 




 Sparrows peck at me, and I must respond. Information technology has cut deeps ruts in the American economy. IT is essential for the management of long supply chains, and as much as Amazon, Walmart is dependent upon it. Both have driven price destruction in consumer goods and driven the manufacture of such offshore. In a lengthy conflict with China, we would have to surrender for lack of underpants. Yes, high sparrow, I am another hard luck, Enemy of the Future. Allow me a few questions, so you might edify my aging brain. What is your measure of efficiency? For the overall economy, the great, promised gains in productivity have yet to appear, and a lower price may sloughed off greater costs to the community or environment  for the definition of an externality, see the entire nation of China. We once viewed gypsy cabbing or renting a spare bedroom to a stranger as acts of financial desperation, rather than a quest for efficiency, and for all of their cost destruction, how many of these digitizing companies are showing a commensurate profit? What is unskilled labor? The current claim is that managerial and professional classes will feel the most impact from automation and digitization (and do you consider all entertainers to be unskilled?), with janitors, manicurists and dog walkers spared into the more distant, robotic future. Trainable labor  in your Utopia, will no one require training? Yes, information (buzzword) is in infinite supply, which only means that most of that buzzing confusion has no value. Who designed this economy, or does it evolve, and what discrepancies have economists ever resolved?

My real concern is that we are accelerating the obsolescence of tangible things in this grubbing quest for digital efficiency. In a world where all resources are diminishing (sorry, even a terabyte of information may not fill an empty stomach), constructs of bricks and mortar, or flesh and blood, may not be so easy to replace once they have been discarded.

 




 I must agree. The article quotes from David Roberts recent Vox piece (The awful truth) that slowing the accumulation of greenhouse gases would require an utterly unprecedented level of global mobilization and coordination, sustained over decades. Well, the present global leadership can only coordinate on a single project, one they have diligently pursued for decades  to engineer a complete collapse of the financial system. That approaching failure offers a dim and slim pathway to human survival. Any financial collapse will lead to sharp fall in trade, employment and perceived wealth. Should the plutocratic elites fail to restore a quick prosperity, their flocks of citizen-consumers may stampede and trample them under. A long and violent period of chaos could permit a novel form of government to arise and assume the keys to power. However egalitarian or inclusive, this must be a militant and totalitarian movement, capable of doing whatever is necessary to kick hapless humanity along the hard path to survival.
Please, can anyone offer a more peaceful, democratic and voluntary solution to our existential crisis?

 




 Is there a point at which creative destruction becomes simply destructive? Joseph Schumpeter theorized in times when technological advances could deliver great gains in quality-of-life to the broadest population. Much of this accelerating digital disruption seems only the churn the economy without any significant social gains. Does Uber raise the earning potential of cabbies? Has the public gained a better access to dependable, hired transportation? Those questions are unresolved, with the only certainty being that Uber is transferring the grossly inflated value of taxicab medallions to speculative price of its traded stock. Schumpeter mused on creative destruction while most of the physical resources of this planet remained in a potential state  those opportunities are closing at an exponential rate. As we continue to shutter factories, vacate shopping malls, and expose the skill sets of swathes of the working population to a near instantaneous devaluation, how much irreplaceable capital, both fixed and human, are we destroying in pursuit of digital disruption? 




 I agree with shroom. It appears that socialism has been the pathway to the most radical form of capitalism, that is, state builds means of production (always as great social cost), then the neo-capitalist ruling class assumes personal ownership. This has occurred in all Communist countries, in other developing countries, and in developed countries (UK is good example). Marxism has been stood on its head! 




 Perhaps the most convincing marker for the beginning of the Anthropocene will be a lengthy postponement in the return of the glaciers. Over the past 900,000, wide spread glaciations have occurred in a fairly regular cycle: Over its current Ice Age, the Northern Hemisphere typically has a sheath of ice for 100,000 years, with intervals of melting that can be as brief as ten millennia. We would expect this present interglacial to be nearing its end, in the absence of the greenhouse warming our civilizations have produced. The paleo-climatologist William Ruddiman proposed there is evidence that we have already done so. 

For the lay public, he presented his hypothesis in a short 2005 book titled Plows, Plagues and Petroleum. He drew attention to the correlation between the historic rise in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane, respectively, by the cutting and burning of forests for agriculture and the domestication of rice, (the flooded paddies produce significant methane). Under the Plow, the Earth remained relatively warm into medieval times.

The article under comment cites the Orbis spike, a significant drop in atmospheric carbon seen after 1492. This resulted from the regrowth of forests in the Western Hemispheric, following the collapse of the Indigenous civilizations from Old World diseases. Ruddiman made the same attribution, but coupled it to the prior devastation visited on Eurasian civilizations by the Black Death  there too, forests retook idled croplands and pastures. By lowering the concentration of greenhouse gasses, Ruddiman contended these Plagues fostered a lowering of global temperatures, the Little Ice Age. Evidence of a nascent glaciation appeared in the region of Hudson Bay.

Finally, Petroleum arrived, and warming abruptly resumed. Ruddiman expected that we would burn all readily accessible fossil fuels, which could abort the return of the Ice until the nadir of the Milankovich orbital cycles. The impact on the geological record will be indisputable. Of course, if that occurs, we should not expect the survival of geologists to note it.
