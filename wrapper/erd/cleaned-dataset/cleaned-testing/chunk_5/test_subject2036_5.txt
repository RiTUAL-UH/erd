 Then watch netflix and cuddle with your dog! And don't say you are a burden. You are not a burden. You are good enough. You don't owe anyone anything. You can get groceries or job hunt when you feel up to it but you are going through a really rough time and you are completely justified in just taking a time out. Does someone with an awful fever say they are a burden when they are lying at home? No. Depression and anxiety are mental diseases. Therefore if you are suffering from them, you are no more being a "burden" than you would be if you had the flu or a broken leg. 

You have to understand that it's not your fault that this has happened to you and you should NEVER feel guilty about not doing mundane tasks because you feel this way. It doesn't matter what anyone else says you should do. Concentrate on the over-riding problem at hand rather than tasks like shopping or job hunting which take an infinitely less priority than your well-being.  




 I think you need to take a day off just to relax. Hide under some blankets and watch a tv show/film that you like, meditate, take a hot bath, just do anything that you know will relax you. When your fiance gets home tell him how you've been feeling and ask him to be with you. You don't have to talk about it or anything but I think you could use the company. It's rough being alone at times like this. I hope I've made you feel at least a little bit better. :)  




 No problem. What do you like doing to relax? Any tv shows or books you're into at the moment? 




 And tell me how it goes. 




 That's okay. If you can, go grab a big glass of water and drink all of it. After that, fill it again and come back to the computer. You should absolutely call your parents if you feel terrible. The fact that they are on vacation shouldn't stop you from doing that. If they knew you were feeling bad they would want you to tell them.  




 Do you have any friends or family you could call right now to talk to and tell them how you feel? If you keep stuff like this bottled up to yourself it can literally drive you insane and it doesn't need to be that difficult. It feels so good to talk about it. Literally call someone who you know will listen, and just let it out. Cry if you need to. Get someone to come round and just open up. If you feel comfortable, talk to your fiance but if not thats fine. If you have no one to talk to, I'm not going anywhere. 




 Okay. Firstly, you have to understand that the state you are in right now is not permanent. You haven't slipped in to a point of no return where you can never feel good again because that simply isn't how depression and anxiety work. This is merely a phase and you will get through it. Its really good that you have already tried to conquer these issues by seeing a psychiatrist so well done! I can't imagine how tough it has been for you this past week but it is going to be okay! have you told your psychiatrist about how you've been feeling recently and is there a way you can get in to contact with them now? 




 It's more than likely that you are just suffering from anxiety. Feeling disorientated and things like that are text book symptoms of becoming over-stressed. Have you ever been to a doctor to talk about how you feel? Are you on meds or anything? 




 That really sucks man :( Im sorry to hear about all that stuff. But first things first. Things like your house being dirty do not matter at the moment. Discard any worry about things like that. Prioritise your mental well-being. So have you felt dizzy for a while or is this a recent thing? 




 Kali. That's a really nice name. So whats the problem? Why are you feeling so down at the moment?  




 Hey! Thanks so much for responding to me. I really wanna talk to you. I wanna make you feel better. My names Isaac, what's yours?
