 I've noticed a lot of posts along the lines of "Don't be this guy" and a post of a member of the master race being a jerk/keeping peasants from ascending.

I think we should get a post flair for this as it seems to be becoming more and more prevalent.

Anyone agree with me?. 




 And what's the oldest one still in use? 




 Nothing wastes water like american fat-asses!  




 No. 




 Now I'm slightly cleaner. 




 Lets play a game. Do this against someone threatening you. And see how many holes you can get and how many limbs you can lose. 




 Well, you gotta make a "byeah"-ing sound. You really have go "byeah" from deep in your byeah. 




 Shhhhh. Don't tell him. 









 Just because something is subjective doesn't mean it isn't bullshit. 




 I'll just sit over here.... Thinking daggerfall is the best TES game.... 









 He's so beautiful *sniff* ^notice ^me ^senpai.... 









 "Welcome to the dancing dojo!" 




 No martial arts are created equal. You're right. But even the "worst" martial art could beat the "best" art depending on the practitioner. I put that rule in there because I didn't want the comment section to devolve into squabbling about how "My art is so much better than your art!"

I will reword that rule though to exclude bullshido arts from that rule. 



















 Just wanna say man, thanks for serving in the military, we're all thankful.  




 No. there's definitely a difference in ranks. Just because they both get shit jobs doesn't mean they are the same. 









 Alright. This is what I got.

Hoo boy, the ability to warp the powers of most super heroes would mean I could simply make them into normal humans. I believe this power would also let me increase my own strength; meaning i'd probably just make myself incredibly strong and make my enemies weaker than myself. I imagine it'd be a bit like a soul suck ability.

This is pretty boring. I'm not sure if i'd use it in a battle honestly. It may be useful to give myself some sort of HUD. An optical overlay with stuff like a tracking system would be useful for mid-combat.

This would be pretty fun. Finish off my opponents this way. If I were to decrease my enemies strength and raise my own then this would probably be my way of manually fighting them. I'd not be able to resist shouting "Ahtatatatata" while I did it though.

I that with the first power alone I could oneshot beings like superman. Against god-like beings it may be more difficult but presumably I could use my powers on them too.

 I just don't see what you mean. If you need an example of early story telling look up ZORK, The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, Adventure, Day of thr tentacle, or any other early text based game. Many of them came out before the NES era.

Or look at the sierra games, they also focused quite a bit on story and many came out before the first super mario bros.

All I'm saying is that story has always been a major part of gaming. 




 And which game suddenly started caring about story that all other games before it lacked? 




 That's an excellent point. I suppose I should change my answer to include whatever was the first game to include saving to whatever they used when such a game came out.

But the reason I picked legend of zelda and battery saving as my example was because it's semi-well known that zelda introduced battery saving and was more relate-ible for most people in the thread. 




 Battery saving. Before they put batteries in cartridges it was impossible to save any data and you had to use something like a password system. With the introduction the first legend of zelda all that changed. It saved your progress and meant games could go from one repetitive task capable of repeating infinitely and meant for a single round to be over in one sitting to large, epic games.

Do you think stuff like skyrim, deus ex, civ, or bioshock could exist without saving? 




 I don't mean martial arts that grant super speed, strength, sense, Etc. But rather are there any martial arts that use pressure points as their main way of combat? I know many martial arts use pressure points but only at the more advanced level and as more of a side to the main technique. But are there any martial arts that use pressure point almost exclusively? 




 Oh shit! sorry man. This is why I shouldn't assume stuff. 




 The real way to do this is VM one of the older windows versions and then run it in that. 




 What's it like? Not having killed six million jews? 




 Funfact: This was me learning of the new rules.
