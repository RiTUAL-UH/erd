 He's said he's going to graduate in June and no information has come to light refuting that, so at this point yeah.
 




 Except he's graduating in June. So he is eligible to go to the draft after next season. 




 Hope like hell he gets in the Hall. He's deserving. 




 They have to pay him, they don't have to play him. In theory they could've DFA'd him. 

There was an understanding that Josh would not be welcomed back to the team, so they spent that time trying to work it out. This is how it eventually got worked out. 




 It's not the organization's fault, but their response was "Screw you for relapsing, you can't play." It was not at all an assessment of his ability to play. It was Arte saying "You will not play for us anymore." 




 How long do you think it would take him to put out each serialized part? Gotta be like at least 9 months. 




 I see what you're saying, absolutely. I just view it as a telescoping serialization, rather than the end of serialization. Although I buy your argument. 

As a whole, you could look at the increasing popularity of series of novels as the next step in serialization. Where before we split up the same (long) book into parts, now we break up the same long series into novels.

In terms of a serialized novel, it'd have to be long enough to support the serialization, but I could imagine a scenario in which it works. I could definitely imagine something like the next Song of Ice and Fire book being serialized to great acclaim, if GRRM decided he wanted to (which there's no way in hell he will). 




 Extended spring training is considered an insult, compared to a rehab stint in the minors. At least, that's how Hamilton took it. In his eyes he's been ready to play. 




 Angels refused to let him play. He wanted to play. 




 Baseball players get paid to play. You pay them varying amounts based on the level you hope they produce at, but they get paid to play. 




 I disagree that Netflix and Hulu means the end of serialization. I'd argue the exact opposite. Netflix IS the new serialization. Look at how they release all their original content: a season at a time. Which people watch in rapid succession and then wait eagerly for the next one.

That's serialization. 




 *Infinite Jest* did that for me 




 [Tongariro by Milorad Pejic.](https://www.guernicamag.com/poetry/tongariro/)

Wish he was more widely available in English. 




 Haha I did, don't worry. You didn't say anything substantively different, unless you mean it's your opinion that Arte shouldn't be involved in player transactions. Which doesn't change the fact that that's not at all what happened here, and it's foolish to pretend like it did.  




 Angels weren't going to get anything for Hamilton because everyone knew how badly Arte wanted him gone. We had absolutely no leverage. 




 Arte is the only reason we signed Hamilton, and he's the only reason we traded him for nothing. Arte and his ego.

So no, we can't leave Arte up in the owner's box. This conversation begins and ends with him. 




 He didn't want to go to extended spring training. I haven't heard about him refusing to go on a rehab assignment in the minors..source? 




 He worked his ass off, it didn't work out. He definitely could've been a productive member of our team this year. Worth the money? Almost assuredly not. But we ran him out of town cuz our feelings got hurt that he wasn't performing. 




 I particularly enjoy the part of all this where Angels fans like to pretend Hamilton wasn't hurt all last year.

Never been so ashamed to be an Angels fan in my life. Our organization treated him horribly. 




 Major Major Major Major is amazing. 




 *Tiny Beautiful Things* really pulled me out of a bad time. 




 I'm really excited for *Slade House* by David Mitchell. Wasn't expecting new work from him so quickly. 




 Wilde was an arrogant asshat for much of his life, but you should check out *De Profundis*. He wrote it after he'd been brought low by life, and it's an incredible read. 

http://upword.com/wilde/de_profundis.html 




 His BABIP was high in part because he was crushing the ball, but yeah, it was gonna come down. I mean the dude was hitting well over .400, it would've been bananas if he didn't. 




 Beginning of last season, before he injured his thumb, he was looking really really good. 




 This. This this this this. This is honestly the lowest point of Angels fandom for me, ever. 




 Not novels strictly speaking, but a lot of Hemingway's short fiction and nonfiction is really good. *Death in the Afternoon*, *A Moveable Feast* (although you could argue that this is fictionalized) are both really good in my opinion. 




 "The time seems simpler than today, but mostly because the past always seems simpler when its wars are done." -*The Boys of Summer* by Roger Kahn

Oh I could do this all day. 




 In that vein, I find his nonfiction to be wonderful. *A Man Without A Country* and *Palm Sunday* are both great, quick, whimsical reads. 




 Basically Fitzgerald's stuff that's not Gatsby 




 That was after this: http://m.mlb.com/video/v33537087/cwslaa-trout-ties-game-with-grand-slam-off-sale

Yes I was just looking for a reason to watch it again. 




 That was the second thing I realized. 




 So stoked to watch him play this year. Oklahoma can be really really good. 




 Hahaha I was about to text this to you and then I read the username. 




 I think it was a risk we needed to take. This was Howie's last year under contract, and we'd made it clear that we weren't going to resign him. Heaney, on the other hand, is a high-ceiling starting pitching prospect, which is by far the weakest position in the organization. He broke camp in AAA, but he will be in the majors before too long if he keeps progressing. We just have options in the rotation for the first time in a long time, which is awesome for us.

Howie was a fan favorite, and it sucked to see him go, but Heaney has a chance to be a key rotation cog for years. With Weaver and Wilson starting to be on the way out, Heaney will get a shot. 




 I wish I knew. We've had some terrible BABIP and RISP luck, but the offense will come around. But the middle of our bullpen has been awful, and our rotation has been very, very meh. We just got back Richards from his knee injury, so hopefully he can adjust and settle in. Shoemaker had his first bad start in forever on Monday, and now he's on the bereavement list. Wilson has shown flashes of pretty good and really bad. Weaver had his first solid outing of the year last night, but the bullpen took it and set it on fire.

Basically, I think we'll be fine if we can get the pen sorted out. We have most of what was a really good bullpen last year, and I think our rotation can surprise people. Just not clicking yet. We tend to do this in April. Last year was our best April in awhile, and we finished the month at .500. 




 Their salaries are very much lower than what rookies make in other leagues, but with the bonuses, the money is there, and for a larger pool of players than in the other sports. Good on you for waiting to research to respond though, there's always things that we don't know and that's a good look.

The Harris poll methodology is a good representation of the current state of affairs, but no one under age 30 was polled. Where the NBA is making big gains is in the younger demographics. Those will take awhile to show up throughout the rest of the population, but in terms of predictors of future success, being popular with the under-30 demographic is a pretty strong one.

And the Bleacher Report thing doesn't have anything that shows a decline in popularity. It's just a think piece about what that dude thinks is wrong with today's NBA. 




 You mean lowest 




 Bryce Dejean-Jones was kinda bad last year. 




 Well let's pick apart just a couple of the things you said wrong.

Baseball is the only professional sport in America where you can make millions of dollars directly out of high school. High school kids get drafted in the top of the first round and sign for multimillion dollar bonuses often. Of the first 74 players picked last year, 2 didn't sign (including the number 1 overall pick, cuz he turned down a $5 million bonus after it was reduced from $6.5 million as a result of his physical); so out of the 72 that did, only 9 did not receive a 7 figure bonus. And the lowest of the bonuses was $546,100. So it's actually the quickest "get rich quick sport".

NBA popularity has not fallen off the table; it's rapidly rising in popularity. I really have no idea where you're drawing that conclusion from. Baseball is still more popular, but the NBA is coming.

 




 1984. 




 It was decently hard hit. Still close to him. Not a bad play, just not showing off any spectacular range. 




 Into the Wild shows both sides in an honest way. Which is why I think that book causes so much controversy between people who come down on one side or the other. It's like, nah man, the wonder of these things here is the tension between them. 




 Downvote the man all you want, he's right. That ball was not very far away. 




 Brendan Ryan was the best. 









 Jon Krakauer is awesome. He really drives at the intersection between modern humanity and nature in a lot of his writing I think.

John Muir's writing is incredible too. *My First Summer in the Sierras* in particular comes to mind. 




 Glad someone said this. Book is infuriating. 




 Yeah I feel like the only one out there! The weird thing about it is that I'm a really generous reader usually (I don't dislike much). I feel like I seriously just had to have missed the entire thing haha. 




 *To Kill A Mockingbird* for me. That book just never came alive to me, I really don't know what it was. I will eventually give it another shot and see if I was just in a bad mood when I initially read it. 




 Roster struggling last year? We had the best record in baseball.

Look I want us to win as much as the next guy. But deep breaths. It's been 13 games. Not even 10% of the season. 




 That commitment is conditional; the consequences of breaking that commitment are that he doesn't get a scholarship to attend Buffalo and play basketball there anymore. That's it. That's all. End of story. 

Lol that's a false comparison. Evans is doing nothing that many other players whose coaches left are doing. I agree that he hasn't necessarily handled it the best by tweeting about it, but no one in this situation has.

The precedent in this extremely-precedented situation is to block conference opponents and out-of-conference rivals, if any. That is the de-facto reasonable limitation, as determined by **the rest of the country**. By blocking more than that, you are being unreasonable, by definition. Especially considering the schools you blocked are his best options, and the places he is most likely to transfer to: where the coach he considers a father figure now works, and the two schools closest to his home.

I'd have preferred if Hurley stayed at Buffalo; I was excited to see what you guys could do with him going forward. But it happened, and acting like this in the aftermath is childish.  




 It's gotta be particularly egregious. That slide is akin to a dude realizing right after he did it that it was not the right play. Gets a yellow all the time. 




 This was my thought. I didn't realize no one knew who he was 




 Takeout slide was intentional, but not the injury, which is what you're mad about. 




 That was a yellow card slide, not a red. 




 Yost was quoting/paraphrasing Herrera when he said that. Yost says that's what Herrera was saying in the post-ejection shenanigans while he was pointing at his head. Yost wasn't offering that as his own thoughts on the matter.  




 I stand corrected in saying that he was there because of Hurley. However, Hurley did coach the two seasons he played for you, and he has referred to him publicly as a father figure.

Just because the rules allow you to do it doesn't mean it's fair at all. I'm having a hard time grasping the idea that someone actually believes that because the NCAA says it's okay, there's obviously nothing wrong with it.

He implied that, but until he has some evidence, that's all he's doing.

I know, I'm glad they lifted the blocks. Cuz it's inane to think that you should be able to control someone else's life in this manner. Sadly, the only reason they lifted the blocks is because they realized how bad it looks, not because they actually feel they were in the wrong. 




 The comments on that youtube video...like I know it's youtube comments but I still can't fathom those responses. 




 See the assumption there is that you control the player, and it's faulty as hell. The player does not have to do what you want him to. You are not "handing [Hurley] our second best player". Evans gets to decide what's best for him, not you. You do not control him, and it's petty, immature, and flat out wrong to try and block him from pursuing what he feels is his next best step. Chances are, he was only at Buffalo because of Hurley anyway. So when he leaves, you just get to control him? Bullshit. 




 Nah cuz the Angels hat only has the A on it. The A's hat has the AS that you need to start ASSHAT. If the A's and Angels switched (woo let's do that yes!), it would spell ASHAST 




 No. This was already a silly situation before that happened. Lawrie was out of line, made a dangerous slide, and got beaned for it. It happens, Lawrie was fine with it, tried to apologize for it (but did or didn't depending on who you believe). It should've been done there.

It's making a big deal out of Cain getting hit in the foot that started the merry go round again. 

I get that you guys are angry about getting hit by so many pitches, but it's really, really not about you. There seems to be this weird narrative that everyone is beaning you because they don't respect you. That's just not true. There is no concerted effort by the rest of the league to bean your team.

I'm not saying you can't be angry; you should be frustrated. It's been terrible luck. But y'all need to realize that no one cares if you feel disrespected, 'cause that's something that's entirely in your own heads. What people do care about, though, is throwing high-90s fastballs behind people's heads. 




 Thanks for sharing the link 




 I found a lot of really interesting parallels between *On The Road* and *Fight Club*, which I know sounds like the most obnoxious combo of all time to a lot of you. I'd read both before, was revisiting, and in conversation with each other you can pick up on a lot of subtext that tends to fly below the radar. 




 Those kids are just as much at risk now. 




 Also, Alan Lightman would be a good person to check out. 




 Anything by Oliver Sacks. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* is a good place to start. 




 He was definitively out. You can see the glove hit Castellanos' foot. 




 I'd donate. 




 I feel the same way about being active during the day. Just started an office job and not sure I'm cut out for it. Thanks! 




 He's technically not disagreeing there haha. If anything he's agreeing. 




 Yeah I'm fine with the way it went down. Winslow is obviously amazing, and I wouldn't have had a problem with his inclusion, but there is a case to be made for leaving him off. Obviously to the voters, it was a compelling one. 




 Echoes of the 2011 ALCS 




 Where is Finnegan in that mix? The pen? 




 How'd you get into lifting freight? What do you think of it? 




 Seriously, I do this all the time.

Best find would have to be Kenzaburo Oe *Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness* because I'd never have expected to be able to find that book anywhere in San Diego, let alone at the Goodwill.

Either that, or the time I found an Environmental Ethics textbook I'd used in one of my courses a couple years back, bought for a dollar, then took to the campus bookstore and resold for 30 haha. 




 The day that happens, you be sure and let me know. 




 Race consciousness is different from racial discrimination. But that's something a lot of America doesn't understand at the moment. 




 Far be it from me. Statistics show that this team only wins World Series Championships when we suck in April. So I'm on the short-term Tank Train 




 Yankees do the same thing by getting a bunch of lefty mashers to take advantage of the short porch in right. Angels do the same thing by getting a bunch of fly ball pitchers whose stuff will play well in big old Angels Stadium. 




 We've won 2 out of 3 series lol, we just happened to get swept in the one we lost. 




 Also, Joyce 2-for-3 with 2 BBs..that's more like it. 




 Ah gotcha. Good to know 




 Didn't realize the game was only 7 innings long. They do that at lower levels? 




 Hits with RISP? I don't know what to do with this 




 Congrats to both of you! /u/stuckinthepow too. It's a big deal to finish 




 When Hector's not walking people he's a whole nother animal 




 I love Thoreau, but I think that quote is just indicative of how this isn't some new phenomenon; people have been saying the same thing in slightly different terms forever. 




 Seemed like he was getting quite a few downvotes before the edit. 




 Yeah, his edit is kinda obnoxious, but he doesn't deserve to be downvoted off his original comment IMO. 









 I would think your word would be "Father", but I guess not haha
