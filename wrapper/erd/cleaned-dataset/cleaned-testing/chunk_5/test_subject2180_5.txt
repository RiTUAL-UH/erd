 Yeah sorry once again that was not clear. The "you" was in reference to Reddit admins and have no morality was in reference  to their policies on censoring in how ironic it was that the ceo of reddit would give coon town a pass because they don't brigade but support the banning of FPH. 

I'm really sorry if you misconstrued my post as an attack on you, i did not remotely mean it to be directed at you, it was horribly worded but if you continue to be a disrespectful individual i will be very clear so you will understand when i am directing vitriol at you. I suggest you calm down before you get more upset in this conversation turns from misunderstanding to a extremely negative exchange. Have a nice day.  




 Sorry i was being rhetorical in reference to Reddit and it's moderators/admins being idiots. In the pedophile reference was to a front page post about Germany providing therapy to pedophiles in how the entire comment section was a bunch of pity post saying how pedo's were not bad people and got a bad rep in some other crap, basically a circle jerk of pedo supporters. In no i was not referring to you personally stating this, i was referring to how the new ceo of reddit officially gave them a pass.

  




 Alright can you point me to some of these NGO's?

Well Kurdistan is not in existence yet, we're effectively referring to Iraqi Kurdistan and only Iraqi Kurdistan. You can't declare them as the only representatives of the Kurdish people, theirs PKK,PDKI,PUK,Gorran Movement,Yekiti,azadi,pyd etc all of which have their own various ideals.

Even bloody KIU is pretty moderate in their views to an Islamic kurdistan. True but theirs a much better chance of him getting released then in say Iran, Gaza or the gulf. Listen i understand the Kurd's are not perfect, neither is america but they're open to dialogue and change. There are progressive elements that can bring about this change.  




 Ha i think it balances it out. Besides if we're going into all the f'ed up crap Christians did to jews throughout the centuries their would not be enough payback in the world. Lets just keep it simple and forgive.  




 Starwars republic commando, say what you will about consoles but that was one of the most graphically beautiful games i have ever played. One of the best looking in that generation and funnest game play experience i ever had. Nothing beat taking over a confederate ship and firing upon another with the hacked cannons while fighting off super battle-droids. PLUS I MUST FIND SEV!!! 




 Welp  either people are blind or the comments maybe collapse after being deleted? hold on let me try in screenshot something for you.  




 Not just sample bias i'm aware theirs even a sizable number of kurds fighting for isis. I believe the commander who laid siege to kobani was a kurd, but i'm an american my view is effeminately colored by my own personal experiences and a generally held view by most Zionist and supporters of Israel along with the news stories and other tidbits i hear coming from kurds. 

But i'm more then willing to hear more information concerning them. Not going to lie i have a romanticized opinion of the kurds, it's hard not to like the underdog perspective. I read the yousef post, you have allot of links i will try to read more of them later(also no offense but i'm not exactly a fan of al jazeera, while some of their articles are pretty informative the bias kills, granted all media is bias so better to read between the lines other people might reject them just for being al jazeera )

While i disagree with them for arresting the guy heavily he is not being executed. In honestly that's my criteria when it comes to rather or not a country is really embracing of democratic ideals. I know that it's horrid to arrest someone for their religious beliefs or not holding anyway but compared to other examples of those who blasphemy islam i think this is a pretty moderate approach that hopefully will be utterly reverse with more people writing in. 

Also to be clear i mean't the kurdish people, not the government or the political parties, the kurds are in a transition phase so their government may not be the best or even ok i believe in the people theirs a higher chance at secularism then other parts of the region. 
 




 Aww they screwed up then. Allot of east Jerusalem Arabs did the same hoping that when Palestine came into being they would just be able take up that citizenship. I read a story as the peace process has stalled a number of east Jerusalemites have begun taking up a offer by israel to become citizens, in part to make sure if they leave Jerusalem they won't lose residency. 

If abbas and netanyahu can ever get their heads out of their collective ass and get some kind of plan to restart talks, it would be hilarious if abbass seeds israel full ownership of jerusalem. It would be like the people waiting for dukenukem for all those years just to be dissapointed but hopefully it works out. Splitting a city between 2 countries is a recipe for war.  




 Nah i get you. I'm a fan of rommel, but too many people confuse nazi with regular while trying to dispel the myth that every German was a nazi. It's always funny when someone tries to post a thoughtful comment about how not all nazi's hated jews or tried to exterminate them when that was their sole purpose, but yeah i'm in the same boat.

It's hard because either you come off sounding like you're excusing the nazi party or trying to justify it.  




 Indeed that's why he is paying it forward to other Christians.  




 20% of israel is actually arab and all have citizenship. Not sure about the Armenians though, but i believe so i'm just taking this off the top of my head but i remember kanye west and kim kardashian baptizing their daughter in a Armenian church so their population must be sizable. If so they probably have citizenship but i will look into it, ask some of my Jewish friends.

Edit: syriac's interesting... god there was something i read awhile back about Christians in Israel moving away from the Arab identity to become something else but i can't remember the name they decided on but the orthodox church in Israel made it official. Is their like something negative associated with being Assyrian like their is with arab in israel? the Assyrians i've met are pretty prideful.  




 I know the Kurd's are religious, yes it's a generalized statement but from the kurds i have talked to and met, many of them hold progressive views. While they of course have their own issues and stigma's compared to other parts of the region they're very secular. Another group of note would of course be turks but they're too nationalistic even in the face of bad leadership. 

 




 interesting factoid, in yeah i've heard of the Assyrian quarter before. Always amazed where people end up, like the circassians being in israel. Have you got any numbers on how many Assyrians are left?  




 Nazi refers almost exclusively to those being card holding members of the nazi political party and held ideological views similar to that of hitler. regular germans were not nazi's, while i'm sure like with mussolini their were/are a few germans who probably remiss fondly about how Hitler made the trains run on time they would still not be considered apart  of the nazi party or a Nazi, you should differentiate. Many Germans would take this extremely offensive.  




  I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.
 He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them also, the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.
 Also he is repaying a debt to those Christians who saved his life when he was a child. He's paying it forward

 This is uplifting not /r/worldnews

If you want to go on rants go to /r/rants have fun. This has nothing to do with your hatred of Israel.  




 Thanks for the clarifications. I always assumed due to the ruins and the simple fact that most assyrians still lived in syria that it was just the remnant of their former empire in their heartland much like turkey would be the remnant of the ottoman empire. 

Edit: was not blaming this on arabs, i assumed that arabs who are the majority, since most islamized people in the middle-east are arab or self identify as arab even if they're actually berber like libyans still consider themselves arab. Also are we referring to just homeland? because i referring to all their territory historically.

He is not a super hero, he's not saying he does not give a fuck but he just can't help them all and stretching himself out would only negatively effect those he can actually help. Alawites have syria protecting them, assad is an alawite and shia have southern iraq. Christians have no allies and no friends coming to help them, no rescue.  




 It did actually. The prophet (PBUH) was actually married to a christian woman and that was his first wife.  




 Indeed. Good news though they have a assyrian channel on public broadcasting in chicago, i watch it sometimes.  




 No such thing as brave and rebellious nazi's you're referring to either the Wehrmacht(regular army of germany) or regular germans who were not members of the nazi party.   




 Not exactly. Assyrians are an ethnic group deriving from the ancient assyrian empire which controlled all of iraq, syria,lebanon and other parts of the region. Syria is basically the homeland of assyrians, i believe syria derives from Assyrian. Most syrians are muslim arabs who arrived during the islamic crusades. Assyrians have been there since the beginning but they're now a minority.  




 Bethel thank you, i really don't think people understand this, he's helping those being most persecuted right now. He has to keep them limited and focused.  




 Yeah i avoid them. Their like SRS mixed with circle jerk. But they stick to their own caves and i stick to the front page so never  the two shall meet. 




 Yeah the mods are doing good. Just scroll down, click on hidden comments and you will see plenty of deleted ones.  




 Unfortunately we have children on the thread and that's why we cannot have nice things yousef.  




 Once again this man is focusing on helping christians who personally helped him. I'm sure on the ground he does not have people sorting christians and non christians into seperate lines in then leaving them behind, he's simply focused on providing the most help he can while at the same time repaying those who saved his life, christians in the region are a minority much like jews were in europe, he cannot save all the muslims, trying to would be beyond his means.

It's like this, if you were living in ww2 in you knew where a death camp was, would you grab a gun and try to liberate it or help the little jewish girl you saw wandering the streets. He has recognized his limits and is focusing on doing as much good as he can with the resources he has, this is the same reason why i don't jump on the us when people say they could of bombed German rail lines to stop the trains delivering jews. I'm not in this mans shoes, we do not know what issues he's facing so we should withhold judgement.  




 Indeed. Maybe we should plug up that /r/gameofthrones leak? 




 So off topic anybody seen the movie pay it forward?  




 Israel secular democratic statehood which provides  humanitarian relief to even their enemies, admits the family of terrorist organizations like hamas and fatah into their territory for treatment as recently as last year. Has caused less casualties in 40 years of war with a entire region then the us and most western powers in one decade of a invasion with a third world country, saved beta israelites(ethiopian jews) throughout the 80's and 90's. Provides humanitarian relief to the world being the first in Haiti after the earth quake, helps African governments suffering from Islamic guerrilla's.

Is the only country where Arab citizens can and do vote frequently, has a supreme court, has a arab supreme court justice, Israeli Arab parties make up a third of their government. Their free speech laws are so supportive that press like haaretz that criticizes the Israeli government and organizations like btselem are frequently cited by Israeli detractors. Israel is the leading country in tech,medical and social media innovations frequently dubbed the silicon valley of the middle-east. 

In i believe was one of the first countries to apply practical military technologies to defensive purposes such as with the iron dome missile defense shield But besides that i guess you can state it as a negative, all those poor children that have been killed, the genocide, apartheid and horrid starvation that cause those obesity rates which put gazans/west banks in the top ten of most obese people in the world. But eh i'm just a Zionist shill....  




 He's actually a german. Who has lived in england i'm assuming his whole life since that's where the kinder-transports ended up. 




 Replace the word debt with duty or obligation. Or just recognize debt unlike how we view something as a mandatory thing that we must pay back regardless of how we feel, the way it is stated in the article is more of a personal choice or moral code. I don't want to whittle this down to religion but theirs a tenet in the Jewish faith that states:

"Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.  Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9; Yerushalmi Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 37a."

had to google this. Despite my name religion is not my strong-suit ha but i have always found this very uplifting. I believe the Koran also has a similar passage. 
 




 Yeah the mods are here now. Scroll down to all the deleted comments. Their were a atleast a dozen or more mentioning Jewish stereotypes like all of them being bankers, making jokes about how jews never pay back debts because the're cheap or greedy etc or just one off random attacks on the man saying he is anti-muslim because he is focused on helping Christians first in some really transparent attempts to justify writing negative statements. Normally i'm all for Reddit being critical of people but i read the article a few times in jesus outside of the guy being Jewish theirs nothing to criticize the man for.

If you really feel so strongly that he(a man who is actually doing something for the people) is not doing enough they could easily find a few charities who donate and help with the refugee situation.  




 lolz sorry was trying to be a little humorous failed. Let me delete tha.t  




 Alright to all the people who are hating on this man or believing he is an islamophobe for not helping Christians either you're not reading the article or clearly taking his words out of context to purposefully attack this man. He is helping christians because it was Quakers and other christian denominations like them who funded the kinder-transports( imagine underground railroad for jews that helped thousands of Jewish children escape Nazi Germany and who later adopted the children helping raise many of them who were to become orphans as hitler's final solution became implemented) which he was extremely fortunate to have been on.
