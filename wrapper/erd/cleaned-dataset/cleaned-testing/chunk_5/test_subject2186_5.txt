 This is a question that greatly interests me (specifically, nitrogen loading during dives)!  Hopefully I can give you an adequate answer, as I only recently started to dive into the appropriate literature. 

All vertebrates have a reflex known as the diving response which conserves oxygen stores but it is more developed in diving air-breathing vertebrates (whales, seals, turtles, penguins, etc.).  This reflex is manifested as peripheral vasoconstriction (reduced blood flow to muscles) and bradycardia (reduced heart-rate).  Also, deeper- and longer-diving species have an increased body mass, decreased relative lung size, increased blood volume, and increased myoglobin (oxygen-binding protein found in muscle tissue) concentration, suggesting these are dive-related adaptations.

 That might be a good way to go, thanks! 




 Thanks!  




 Thanks!  I've been considering going that route and I'm glad to hear it seems to be beneficial. 




 I'm interested in lifting, but haven't done so since I did it a few times for sports my freshman year of high school (7 years ago), so I have no idea how to even get into it (routine, technique, etc.).  Do you guys have any suggestions?  I've been going to the RPAC and doing cardio stuff 2-3 times a week for about a year, but I'd love to do something else! 




 Also, there are at least two distinct grey whale populations in the North Pacific.  They both feed around Alaska in the warmer months, but when it's gets colder, one group moves down to Baja and the other moves toward Japan to breed. Since this one (or two?) was found in Baja, I don't think it's mother ever went close enough to Fukushima to be affected by the radiation leak. 




 I saw an interview with one of the helicopter pilots a couple years ago in which he said it's against maritime law for aircraft to drop things onto ships.  I imagine that would apply to drones as well. 




 I've heard that 70% of the money SeaWorld makes comes directly from the captivity of orcas, so that would be an interesting question to look in to - whether or not they could afford their rescue and rehab programs without the orcas.  Even so, is the good that SeaWorld does outweighed by the problems associated with captivity?  Would people care more/less and provide more/less money to conservation if there was no SeaWorld?  It's hard to say either way. 




 Actually, [the United States hasn't whaled since 1927.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_the_United_States)  There was a huge uproar from locals when SeaWorld caught orcas in 1976 in Puget Sound (note, 50 years after the end of industrial whaling), so much so that the [state of Washington made it illegal to capture whales in their waters.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/cron.html)   However, I will give you that the capture of orcas in the 1960s and 1970s did change national public perception of orcas - prior to that, they were feared (much like great white sharks) and were even used as target practice by the navy.

Another thing is that these whales are not domesticated.  In fact, I would argue there are not enough captive whales to ever have domesticated population.  The wild whales that were caught were not caught because of their personalities, they were caught solely because they were the smallest.  Domestication takes many generations, much more than the 1-3 generation whales that are currently in captivity.  And the fact that orcas are much more intelligent than any domesticated animals, rivaling human cognition, now makes the prospect that much more difficult.

Also, SeaWorld has an orca in it's collection that was taken from the wild in 2010.  She is currently at a park in the Canary Islands called Loro Parque, but all the whales there are considered loans from SeaWorld.

Saying SeaWorld dedicates themselves to education, research, and conservation is also a stretch.  They provide a lot of misinformation or complete falsities about ocras, in particular (you can find videos on YouTube of the staff saying things to people that the people know are false).  They do have a research branch and do fund projects, and they also provide their orcas for research on general anatomy and physiology, but a majority of their research is based on animal husbandry.  They also participate in strandings and other animal rescues, but that's about the extent of their conservation efforts.  SeaWorld is a business, so they're dedicated to making money, which is perfectly acceptable to me and I have no issue with that.  They care about keeping the animals they have healthy, getting more animals (either through breeding or through animals that they rescue), and getting people in the door.  Most people go the SeaWorld for excitement, which is why you see more rides there than you do interactive climate models.

Now, there are a ton of issues associated with releasing the whales, which I [answer in detail here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/marinebiology/comments/1thxi6/marine_biologists_of_reddit_could_sea_worlds/ce8cq7s)  Another wrinkle I didn't mention before is that a majority of the whales have worn out teeth that have been drilled out and need to be flushed regularly to avoid infection - so that would also cause an issue with release.

I do think that people who go to SeaWorld enjoy the anthropomorphic relationship presented during the shows.  However, I don't think that people change their lifestyle habits in order to reduce their impact on wild orcas.  People go to SeaWorld to feel good, not really to think about the uncertain future of some of most beautiful and intelligent species on Earth.

There is no easy (or probably best) answer to where to go as a society in terms of captivity for large, intelligent animals, but I'm glad that we are having the discussion. 




 Very interesting and multifaceted question.  I will try to hit the major points of it and will use a comment I wrote about a similar question I answered about a week ago to broaden it.  I'm also going to try to correct some misconceptions you write, but please try not to take them with any hard feelings!

 there are two sides to every story

This is correct, and as an avid supporter of the movie Blackfish, I feel it is important to note that it is an activist film.  I've studied the captivity issue for about as long as the director of the movie has, but unfortunately some of the information is presented in a biased or false manner.  For example, the scientist that studies the whales around Puget Sound said that a wild orca whale has never harmed a person, but wikipedia [has a list of what could be considered attacks, including one on a surfer that was extremely severe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans)  Also the movie doesn't explain that, Tilly was caught with another young whale, and both were kept in a giant tank in a hangar-like building in Europe and trained there through punishment before he could be moved to Canada.  I believe I read this in the book, [Death at SeaWrold by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/), but I which the movie would have talked about this more because I believe this early trauma was just as important as that he received at Sealand of the Pacific.  It may direct some of the public hatred away from the captive parks themselves, but I think it would make the movie feel less biased.  Although I think the backlash the captive industry is receiving is justified, I had a sour taste in my mouth from these two instances in the film the first time I watched it.

If you are interested in the topic of captivity, I would suggest you look into Death at SeaWorld, as well as the documentary, [A Fall From Freedom](http://vimeo.com/40600148), and the Frontline special, [A Whale of a Business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fZ2dMdtu8)

 He now sits in a seperated tank and is cordoned off from everyone else

According to SeaWorld, he was kept alone because he was afraid of the tanks that had the new safety floors installed, but they have been trying to acclimate him to them.  I don't know if this is true or not since I haven't been there in about a decade, but I hope the trainers wouldn't let him be isolated for something he did almost 4 years ago.

 starving the animals of food to perform so that they can be fed

They don't starve the animals at SeaWorld since they need the animals to be healthy.  They do something they call positive reinforcement.  Essentially, the whales do something the trainers like and the whales get something they like.  The whales get fed outside of shows (I've seen this myself), but it wouldn't surprise me (as stated in Blackfish) if the meals are cut before important shows to make the whales more likely to perform.  I've been at shows where one or two of the whales aren't interested in performing, so I know that the whales don't feel it's completely necessary for their survival that they go through with every single performance.  This is my own personal opinion, but I would equate the shows with a set of weights in a prison yard - it's mostly something to keep the whales somewhat occupied during their barren, under-stimulated existences.

 why can't we just end the captivity and performing of these wild animals? I understand that it is a huge revenue stream

You answered your own question.  SeaWorld is a huge business, which is why these animals are still performing.  If people didn't go to see cetaceans in captivity, the captive industry would grind to a halt.  However, this would lead to the discussion of what to do with the animals, which is actually very complicated.  I'd say that it would be impossible to release all of the captive killer whales (not to mention the other captive marine mammals) and expect them all to survive.  I think the whales that were born in the wild would have an easier time adjusting back to that kind of lifestyle than would the captive-born whales that had never experienced a natural environment. I'm sure you could train all of them to hunt though, at least enough to get by.  Also, the price would be astronomical.  Keiko was a challenge and he was 1 whale, I can't imagine funding and organize the release of the almost 30 orca owned by SeaWorld (or the 54 total in captivity worldwide).

What would be even more challenging would be to determine where to release captive-born whales (34 of the 54 worldwide). SeaWorld's wild whales came from 2 different parts of the world - the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and the North Atlantic (Iceland). They have also recently been getting sperm from an orca named Kshamenk, who resides at Mundo Marino and was captured off the coast of Argentina. Orca have very distinct cultures, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, there are 4 distinct "cultures" - Northern Residents, Southern Residents, Transients, and Offshores - that rarely interact and never interbreed. These "cultures" each have their own unique forms of communication, known as dialects. The North Atlantic population is less studied than the Pacific Northwest population, but I assume there are also distinct "cultures" in that population.

Keiko was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod. I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation. Springer, a Southern Resident whale in the Pacific Northwest who was orphaned and rehabilitated in a sea pen, was adopted by her aunt's pod, so it's possible that a whale like Lolita at the Miami Seaquarium could be taken in by a pod if she were released, since she was captured from a Southern Resident pod.
Back to the captive-born whales. Many of them are genetic mixtures of Pacific Northwest, North Atlantic, and now Southern Atlantic whales. This means that it's possible wild whales could reject them based on morphology alone. Not to mention how incestual the genetic lines are in the SeaWorld whales, which makes it difficult to decide how to define what a family group is amongst the captive whales and how to divide them between release locations.

I would be interested in finding out how the whales communicate at the parks now. If the captive-born ones seem to be using a dialect similar to any one particular group that was passed down to them by the older wild-caught whales, maybe they could be released in the area where that dialect originates. That's assuming that the whales haven't come up with their own crude captive (possibly even park-specific) dialect(s). If they did that, you could make the case of releasing them all together in one spot, but that probably wouldn't be the best idea since some of the captive whales seem to show high levels of aggression towards one another. Also, there probably aren't many places that have a local ecology that could handle such an influx of apex predators.
Plus, the released whales would probably act like Keiko and seek out human interaction, which would be especially bad for them if they were to congregate in a high-traffic, highly populated area.


 Why can't we just release them back into the wild and if people want to see them go on Whale Watching tours, visit a national park, or just go out to that animal's natural habitat and observe them being them, rather than performing some mundane trick for your enjoyment.

These are much better options in my opinion, but are not perfect.  Whale watching can be rather hit-or-miss when it comes to seeing the whales or dolphins you want to see, and you rarely (if ever) get as close to the animals as you do in captive facilities.  Captivity gives the public this sense of bonding with the animals, even though it's completely fabricated and unrealistic.  Visiting natural habitats also has it's problems.  For example, there is an issue with the amount of pollution in the Galapagos Islands (which are considered a nature reserve) from the sheer number of tourists that visit the area annually.  I'm hoping that as technology improves, we'll have things like simulators or maybe ROVs or something awesome that hasn't even been thought of yet that can bring more people the joys of the natural world around us without imposing the problems of more people on the wilderness.



But anyway, in terms of captivity, I think the best route for us to take is to focus on the young, recently captured whales, like Morgan from the Netherlands who was captured in 2010, Narnia from Russia who was captured in 2012, or the 7 whales captured in Russia in September and October of 2013.  If any whales were able to be successfully released, it would most likely be these whales.

Let me know if you're interested in more information on this subject, I'd be more than happy to either elaborate or provide you with some direction on where to look!  I'd apologize for the wall of text, but this topic is a passion of mine and I think it needs to be explained as thoroughly as possible! 




 Possibly.

The North Atlantic population is less studied than the Pacific Northwest population, but I assume there are also distinct "cultures" in that population.

Keiko (Free Willy) was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod.  I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation.

So, if by survive you mean not die immediately of starvation then probably, but if you mean live like a normal wild whale then the answer is almost definitely not. 




 Very true.  I'm not sure how to find these financing figures, but it would be interesting to see how for-profit zoos and aqauriums compare to SeaWorld.
