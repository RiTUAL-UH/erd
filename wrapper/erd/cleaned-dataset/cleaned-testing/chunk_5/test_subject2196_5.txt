 Thank you, that is incredibly helpful. I am going to try to arrange a meeting right now. 




 He was trying to force me to stay past my clock out time, when I am in a good mood I will volunteer time to help clean up and do more work, they will have me burn off the overtime later as a result. If he had actually asked me, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal. 




 Thank you for the response, luckily there were a few people around, including my fellow IMS co-worker, so I should be covered as far as witnesses go.
