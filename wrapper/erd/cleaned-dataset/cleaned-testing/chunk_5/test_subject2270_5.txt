 hahaha!  yup, nothing like a kick to the dick.  a friend of mine goes to that college now and i really want to find that prof to tell him the whole story, it really bothers me. 




 i didn't want it to be the focus of the story or paint transgender folk as creepy or wrong, but it was what it was.
well, i didn't learn a single thing because i go down by the river still all the time.  haven't had a single problem.  not going to live in fear because of one random weirdo.
