 Yeah, I don't really deserves to be whitewashed into a 'worst episode ever' hole. at least it took some dramatic risks. 




 I *Think* the general trend is that the more sci-fi guys REALLY hated it and the more 'broad strokes' kind of guys liked it. I *think*. 




 well I *liked* it. 




 Still doesn't change the fact she cloned big boss multiple times without him asking, after specifically saying it was against her moral code in mgs3, creating the rift that ended up driving the patriots apart, as well as drive gray fox crazy enough to kill her. She could well be 'forced into it by zero' or something, but I think that's less interesting than having her do it of her own volition. Her betrayal probably struck Big boss the hardest. He'd expect EVA or ocelot or zero to betray him, they're spies after all, but the kind hearted medic who was obsessed with movies? 




 Ideally, I think he should only appear in some sort of 1970's style flashback sequence. Para medic would probably be a better fit for having an actual confrontation with Big boss, seeing as she was essentially snakes best friend, and a lot of people's favorite character in 3, and she's pretty much the most morally bankrupt member of the patriots. 




 All the patriots in the same room. Think of the tension of Para-medic, sigint, zero, snake, ocelot and EVA being together. 




 Heck yeah I'm interested! 




 It's got a lot to do with how homogenized main male leads are, the only real roles troy baker and Nolan north can't do are the more 'japanese' style leads. (generally the higher pitched voices and stuff) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'd personally like to see more variety in main characters in the games industry than 'white, middle aged male' or 'British white middle aged male'  




 Are you using a +15 weapon? I manages to kill him in 5 hits with the BSS +15. Alternatively, two hand a weapon, attack once and back off whenever he attempts an attack. (unless he does a butt stomp, keep close for that attack) The only easier boss for me was pinwheel.

Oh, and if you want to level up, go to the painted world and kill the phalanx, and if you want to skip the fight entirely, feed 30 humanity to quelaags sister. 




 Yep, and unlike Kaathe of Fraamt, velka doesn't dick you around, she just gives you supplies and help to carry out the job. 




 There's actually three main forces manipulating the CU in the game: Fraamt, Kaathe, and Velka. Velka's goal is just to get you to kill the Gods, probably with the occult weapons she basically hands you, and she's the only one who ALWAYS succeeds at her goal. 




 The stray demon is all about dodging and mobility. Two hand your weapon, run up, attack, and then back off when he does the power wave. He's been the hardest boss so far for me too. 




 Yeah, There's also some pretty cool metric remixes on the deluxe version of the 'fantasies' album, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-gVPGULgw) 




 Xenoblade chronicles did that.In fact, It's about climbing from one giant dead machine god to the other, evil giant dead machine god. 




 Don't worry bout it man! 




 Yeah, that song got me into metric [pretty much all their songs are that good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtd8ArvH_s) 




 Uh, I dunno, those spandex are pretty intimidating... 




 Gah, was I the only one who thought this episode was a great time to re-introduce the [Raston warrior robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQVtmYfLtk) AKA the silver ranger AKA crap ultraman? I mean, It would be better than the spider demon we got. 




 but there's a new one, and I remember reading about it being a 'buddy' rank on this reddit 




 Weren't 'buddy' ranks shown on the analyzer though? 




 Well, like a lot of hollywood films, ASM had a whole bundle of writers and rewrites, the most direct culprit of all the 'crap parts' in modern movies is Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman though. 




 Have you been to the painted world or undead asylum? You get a tonne of stuff and levels from there if you're having trouble 




 You can go wherever now. Go to the dukes archives if you want to do DLC, go to new londo if you want to +15 weapons, and go to the catacombs if you want the easiest time. 




 I was in the same boat a couple days ago, but instead of solaire I summoned a giantdad. I took down smough first too! 




 Young fatman. 




 TBH, after mgs2's story, you can't really blame people. 




 It's because TPP is based on Moby dick, which, as you probably know, is all about DICKS, hence the title, and the part where it describes how you can turn a whale dick into a coat or whatever. Therefore, TPP is all about the D, hence DD,or 'double dickin', and quiet being a 'naked sniper' because she's chico and something something reasons. 




 He's just doing it to throw us off the scent, hence why a dog was just introduced, he's saying "You'll have to sniff out the fact that quiet is chico" The dogs eyepatch represents the communities blindness to the fact that quiet is Chico, whilst the other eye represents the true fans who KNOW she's chico. The dog is also called DD, and what do you think quietes breast size is? Coincidence? UNLIKELY! 




 Couldn't kaz function identically to big boss as seen in the trailers, I mean, he has a missing arm too, so all the prostetics could be used no? 









 There's actually a weapon XI in the comics, so he's not even an original character! 




 SO I'm assuming you got platinum this recently to get into the bloodborne Alpha? If not, congratulations! You're now eligible for the bloodborne alpha!  




 If I remember correctly, that room was found, but the trigger wasn't discovered until revealed by the devs. I also think that the code for AA was a lot more complicated than the code for Dark souls. 




 Not really, a month's usually when marketing campaigns start up 




 Yeah, that's the joke, zoey was semi referencing the multiversity 'DC worlds' chart. 




 I thin the real question is where do captain carrot and the amazing zoo crew com into this? They've been out of continuity for so long, they need a comeback. 




 Hey man, I'm also on my first playthrough, lvl 44 and in in exactly the same place. I might PM you, although I won't be able to do mic chat or anything. 




 It could be a version of her warped by the space-time continuum, or something like that. Still, as I said, it seems unlikely that the writers will add existential dread into the show. 




 well there isn't really any evidence for that theory other than a couple lines of dialogue. You have to go through a lot of logical loops to think a kid would reasonably act like that. 




 So my theory for the 'monster' of this episode is that it's actually some sort of time distorted version of Clara. Think about it. She's been scattered through time, every time, every place the doctor goes or thinks about going. We've already seen it go wrong with dalek!Clara, don't you think a universal constant obsessed with the Doctor would create some, y'know issues for the universe.

However, I doubt we'll ever get a real reveal. My above theory is too dark and grand for them to follow through, but it's neat to think about! 




 Hey, I'm playing the game for the first time and I happened to sparta kick a guy off the stairs in that area. How long ago did it happen for you? 




 Yeah, platinum games is japanese, but the makers of dead rising are canadian I think. 




 Actually, this game was made by western devs, just published at capcom. 




 oh really? I don't know much about TRPG's, but I assumed it was simple because it can be adapted so easily. Guess not. 




 I was just thinking this. I think the only one people haven't suggested yet is GURPS, which facilitates these sort of 'simple, generic TRPG' games found on yogsquest. 




 It might be GURPS, or at least, that seems most facilitating to 'generic space fantasy' 




 Yeah, but it was published by DC, so it's a DC graphic novel, the original intent of the book doesn't come into it. If you want to be **really** anal, you can also point out that their was a question/watchmen crossover, so watchmen still is technically in DC comics 'mainline continuity'. 




 But it was **published** by DC. 




 I literally did this 5 minutes ago. I was super excited and then I realized why I don't play horror games. 




 You should really get the HD collection if you liked 4. MGS2 is really weird and peace walker is pretty arcadey but MGS3 is a big candidate for the best stealth game and story ever made.  




 everybody has a different favorite zelda game, mainly because they're meant to be games you play in your early teens. This squabbling happens on every thread on every forum, nobody will every define the 'best' zelda game because it doesn't exist. 




 I'm pretty sure a lot of the female POWS are good at intel, it's just intel units are some of the easiest to grind in the game, and there aren't that many B-A rank POWS, so you tend to ignore the fairly decent female intel units the game spawns in the mid game. 




 Or you can just be any other hero in the marvel universe that's more powerful than taskmaster, I love im', but man is that guy a punching bag. 




 Action movies are meant to be about aberrant cases, they're not meant to be about mediocre tales filled with mediocre people. 




 Well the writer of that movie did Just direct the summers biggest blockbuster so it's pretty justified. 




 Yep, I'm looking forward to the inevitable moon knight movie. 




 The problem lies with the properties that FOX and SONY basically accidentally bought. Deadpool, galactus, the skrulls and various other characters that first appeared in fantastic 4,x-men or spiderman were bought by fluke, and now marvel's run out of every A-lister other than ms Marvel.

 On the other hand, if Marvel had the X-men rights a deadpool movie would have been made years ago. 









 Hey man have you ever thought of doing Civ V videos? Maybe commentary over yogscast ones? Because you have a real knack for it. 




 Although pixar have yet to produce a really good movie since 2010, which is a pretty big problem for the company. 




 That first APC is the first boss you face, so is the most memorable and likely capture. Therefore, since it always produces alligator he's the most memorable soldier, and the most likely that EVERY player has other than the only other unique, Kojima. Since Kojima was already in GZ, hopefully some of the peace walker codenames come back, such as alligator and thresher shark. 




 I thought Alligator was the first one to always drop out of the APC though? maybe that's why, he's pretty much the most 'canon' soldier you find in the field other than kojima 




 I think you misspelled Thresher shark. 




 Hey, do you mind pointing me to the where the alligator meme came from? I've seen it referenced multiple times on the subreddit and tv tropes, but after google searching I've yet to see the origins of Alligator being the most famous MSF soldier. 




 Although, to be fair it was originally Donald Blake becoming Thor, so it does have a bit of precedence. 




 I get where your coming from, I truly do, and I HOPE Ant man is a good or great film, and that Edgar Wrights vision carries over,however, I think the complaints are way more justified than you make them out to be.


1) Joss whedon is in no way comparable to Reed. Joss Whedon worked on the scripts for X-men, Toy story and the x-men comics. He also wrote and directed multiple Emmy award winning shows that had directorially strong moments. ('Hush' comes to mind) He also made Serenity, which, commercial success or not, was one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the past decade. It's dumb to have doubts about Joss Whedon, it's not to have doubts about Peyton Reed, whose made multiple Bad, mediocre, and more importantly generically directed movies.


2) Favreau also made multiple great movies, I don't get why people keep bringing Elf up, It was a great Christmas movie. Alan Taylor directed episodes of the most critically acclaimed fantasy TV show of all time.The Russo's are slightly more comparable but didn't take over from an amazing Action director like, say, Tarantino.


3) I think the most valid comparison is actually another studio. Darren Aranofsky was originally set to direct the wolverine. But got replaced at the last minute due to 'directorial differences.' You can logically apply all the same arguments to FOX, they hadn't gotten it wrong yet, (x-men 3 and origins wolverine are comparable to the incredible hulk and Iron man 2) James Marigold has directed stuff before etc. etc. posthumously, don't you think people saying Aranofsky would've done a better job were correct? This stuff has precedence, it's not completely out of leftfield.


Small aside: Edgar's work is hardly obscure stuff, ESPECIALLY as we have to compare it to British films rather than American films. The cornetto trilogy has been hugely critically successful, and was one of the most commercially successful franchises in British cinema. Even Scott pilgrim didn't lose money and became a cult hit on DVD.


In conclusion. The Edgar Wright fiasco is way more rational that going "wah wah, Gal Godot is too skinny" 




 How are they changing the character? Thor isn't literally changing genders, he's just temporarily become de-powered, whilst someone else takes up the mantel. He's not even leaving the comic! Completely changing the character is like when in the 80's Thor became a frog and solved animal problems for 6 issues, and that is seen by many as the greatest Thor story ever told. 

Comics are about non static characters, 12 come out every year after all, so they **have** to change things up to keep interest up. The harry potter comparison doesn't really work, but actually did happen. In the last two Harry potter books, J.K Rowling not only killed Dumbledore, but set the last book entirely outside of Hogwarts, because good characters grow and change and face adversity, rather than remain static. 




 Whilst I agree with you over the fanboys being fanboys stuff, there's a significant difference between complaining about Joss Whedon (who had already directed two great films, serenity and cabin in the woods) and worrying about Ant man now that Wright's left. Edgar Wright is probably the best action comedy director or the last decade. It's reasonable to assume that Peyton Reed will not fill his directorial shoes, it's am similar situation to the Star trek 3 Roberto Orci thing: There's actual evidence that those people will do a worse job. 




 Why? What is so upsetting about a temporary change during a story arc? It's just whining about writers wanting to tell any sort of interesting narrative. If beta Ray bill or frog Thor were introduced today, people would be up in arms, despite those being two of the best Thor stories. 




 It's because apparently fanboys can't fathom an actor and a character looking different. It's pretty objectifying behavior honestly, and I'm SERIOUSLY surprised nobodies complained about Dwayne Johnson playing Shazam when the character is white. 




 I bought it on Itunes, can I get in on this sweet deal or do I have to use methods other than Itunes to listen in? 




 The cycle is being repeated with the Gal Godot/ Jesse Eisenberg stuff, lambasting people for hypothetical performances. The worst part is that the asshole fanboy always gets to say the last word. If Gal Godot is great, they'll either say 'well she put in a surprisingly competent performance' or they turn up their noses and say 'well, Gal godot did an ok performance but such and such would've been better IMO' but if Gal Godot does a bad performance, fanboys get to say 'see, I was right all along, my fatalistic attitude happened to align somewhat with reality, aren't I the BEST?' 




 Deadpool's really popular actually. He's been in a tonne of games (MVC, marvel ultimate alliance, was a main character in that marvel MMO, was a main character in lego marvel, had his own game that was popular with lets players) been featured in a couple of cartoons and is generally incredibly popular in the under 30/ geek market. He's also one of the bestselling marvel characters, and is prominent in the marvel universe (he's basically the new wolverine, popping up in other peoples comics. I'd definitely say he's the most popular marvel hero with no movie, and if FOX didn't get the rights by fluke, marvel would have made a deadpool movie already. 




 Actually, deadpool is probably the most popular marvel character without a movie. He's definitely A-list and has been in a lot of videogames/cartoons. 




 Funnily enough, I just got the game and, despite the fact I was attempting to fight the Taurus demon at level 9 as a thief, the ascent never bothered me at all, and I had to do it 6-8 times because I was apparently underleveled for the demon. Eventually beat it by going human for the first time and requesting assistance (but not before having to kick a PVP guy off a cliff, again at level 9) what a game! 




 A triple A studio that closed a a year later... 




 So I'm just notifying those unaware right now, but r/games currently has two fairly enlightening threads about the yogscast right now. One talks of the recent Totalbiscuit video outlining problems with the yogscasts new business model 


(http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2arhv6/totalbiscuit_outlines_a_number_of_issues_with_the/)


and another talks of the apparent abandonment of the yogventures game 

(http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2apng1/yogscast_cheat_backers_for_567000_on/)

I realize that this is essentially a link to other reddit posts, but since this is a subreddit dedicated entirely to the yogscast, I think it's important that you're kept notified of the 'current affairs' so to speak. Lewis has also been VERY active on this, so if you have any queries about yogventures or the promos, now might be the best time to say them. 




 Interesting thing about the movie is how it was heavily influenced by the fandom, and in particular fanfiction. Elements like Charlotte and sakuya/kyoko shipping are big in the fandom, as are 'happy endings' so I highly reccomend checking out the madoka magica entry on TV tropes to catch all the nods. 




 Hey, if the EU is non canon doesn't that technically mean that they can 'reveal' Boba fett in empire was a girl again? 




 Eh, It's debatable. It BECOMES part of the narrative, but you can really easily not watch it if you think Ep 12 was the perfect ending. Part of the magic of rebellion is that ep 12 essentially left no loose ends, so it makes you feel like a bastard for requesting a arbitrary (and deliberately) contrived 'continuation' of the story, despite the fact it's over. 




 I would actually say to only watch rebellion if you want more madoka magica content. It's a better film if you approach it with the mentality that you're actively watching to get more content with the characters, rather than assuming it's part of the pre-existing narrative. Rebellion also makes more sense if you read Madoka magica's TV tropes page (after watching the main series) because rebellion also makes lots of references to the fandom.  




 I first heard it from an n64 OOC preview. Death mountain was THE scaleable mountain. 




 Hey, If you like KLK, and want to get more into anime, particularly anime with strong female characters, I recommend you do what I did and watch Madoka magica and Black lagoon. Both have really incredible characters, visuals, narratives and action. Seriously, Madoka magica is 4 hours long yet is my favourite TV show of all time. 




 Actually, the recent deadpool series has had some pretty heavy moments. The negative aspects of deadpool mainly come from the Daniel way run. 




 I think Squirrel girl has little fucks to give about anything black bolt can do to her. 




 Wow. why are you on a film subreddit if you're so ignorant about film in general? 




 Nope, not true. People don't talk about *a fantastic fear of everything* people don't talk about *how to lose friends and alienate people.* nobody was going to see Ant man for Paul Rudd alone, people were hyped about Wright and his fantastic direction. Being dismissive of a good director is being dismissive of film as a craft by Proxy. 




 Shaun of the Dead is not a 'niche' film. It was one of the most successful British films of the decade and is seen as iconic by tonnes of directors, from Tarantino to Romero. It is not niche if it's always brought up in discussion with 28 days later, the walking dead etc. as part of the 'new wave of zombie media. 




 YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole! and YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole! And YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole.... 









 Will magical girl shows ever be the same after revolutionary girl Utena? 




 I never said she was well know outside of comics circles hence the remark about C/D list heroes, frankly, I'm surprised you haven't heard of her, given that you've heard of world war hulk/ Electra (who is pretty b/c-list in comic terms) I don't know why you assumed that I wasn't talking about A-list in comic book terms when you specifically indicated you were talking in comic book terms by bring up World war Hulk. 




 I would say so, Electra has been dead for decades, the fantastic four haven't really been relevant to the big teamups/ they're not really a flagship, and Black widow isn't necessarily 'heroic' although all those characters barring electra are A-list anyway, so it doesn't really matter. Ms. Marvel is a big deal, and she'll become a bigger deal when she gets her own movie. 




 In my mind, 'list' standing is defined by relevance to the actual universe/cross pollination. Carol Danvers is a primary member of the Avengers, Marvel's premier superhero team,and has been for ages therefore, I posit that she's A-list. I would also argue that her DC equivalent, wonder-woman, has never been a massively popular character amongst fans, at least when compared to say, Batman, wolverine or deadpool, yet is branded A-list. 




 She was in world war Hulk with spider-man and stuff, a lot of superheroes were defeated off panel in that mini. Going by that logic ghost rider, who actually BEAT hulk in a fight would be A-list. She's been on the avengers for the past 30 years, and she's widely viewed as the most notable female marvel superhero outside of the x-men, she's A-list. 




 A couple of months ago, Peter parker had been dead for a year with Doctor Octopus controlling his body a *lot* of wierd stuff happens in comics 




 She's A-list in comic terms, but pretty C/D-list in terms of cartoon appearances and the like. Comic's operate on different levels to other media in terms of recognizable characters, for example, probably the most popular marvel hero for fans is actually deadpool. 




 Actually, now there are two Ms Marvels, Carol Danvers has been pretty relevant to marvel since the 80's, (she has been on the avengers for ages, making her A-list in comic book terms) but recently, she became captain marvel and the ms marvel mantle passed on to a new girl, who's comic has only reached issue 4. She's notable for being the most mainstream Muslim superhero, and that comic may also potentially get adapted. 




 I'll replace Paul Rudd. 




 Yeah, that was meant to be Bill, but it's difficult to say how much focus was intended given that that sequence had an entirely different production team. Perhaps the 4-hour cut goes into more detail, what with it having an extended anime sequence. 




 Actually, Iron man has a pretty decent array of technological/magical villains, but because most of the tech villains overlap with captain america and magic hasn't been established in the MCU yet, you're left with a lot of rivals (that were done pretty poorly)  




 aren't they making that movie? It's called the expendabelles?
