 There is no such thing as "Reverse Discrimination", yes sometime black, hispanic or asian people discriminate against white people, but that is simply discrimination, not "Reverse Discrimination". The opposite of discrimination would be when someone doesn't discriminate against anyone. There is no such thing as reverse racism or reverse prejudice either. Using terms like "reverse discrimination" supports the racist myth that only white people can discriminate or be prejudice.

 It isn't unions that are stealing workers pay, it's chief executives who take home $1,000 for every $1 dollar earned by their average worker and donating ten times that average worker's salary to some union-busting political PACs.

Absolutely, we did two deployments, Higbie said. We did one in 2007 and in 2009. We did this foreign international defense over there, and its not effective. They dont have the accountability, and the understanding, and the actual fortitude to fight an enemy like ISIS whos dedicated. Theyre willing to die for this cause.

 I do not believe that corporations are people, but my Senators (Sessions   Shelby) do.

 The problem with the narrative that the Independent is trying to spin here is that there is actually ["wide support for striking ISIS"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/09/National-Politics/Polling/release_361.xml) amongst the U.S. public.  




 When did the WMD's become **THE** reason we take military action against someone? A Country can be a threat without WMD's.

 No minimum wage, no food stamps, no welfare, no social security back then and this was how some people lived. And yet some people today would have you believe that people only need entitlements because they have become addicted to them.

 What I never see explained in these type of stories is how common burglars and carjackers know that there has been an increase in the amount of concealed carry permits being issued and therefore a greater chance that their potential victim may be armed, do they go down to the sheriff's office and ask? And if the lowest rungs of the criminal element aren't aware that there are more people with guns, then how is it a deterrent?
