 Did they run that double move for this throw? 




 Honestly if you told me before hand the game was going to be this close I would have been ok with it. Obviously I wanted a win, screw off everyone who wanted the vikes to lose. You aren't true Viking fans. Teddy made some rookie mistakes, but wasn't awful. Running game never found rhythm. Defense looked great until they ran out of steam. 

It was a fun game to watch, Skol Vikings.
