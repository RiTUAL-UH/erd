 Thank you Mongo and Nadelus for your contributions and insights.
I think people are judging Robocop 2014 too harshly on it being a remake for two reasons:  nostalgia and the "ickiness" of the term "remake". 

In fact - I think we agree in that this Robocop stays true to the "soul" of the original in that it takes a great premise of Frankenstein/Man/Machine and also injects commentary of America.  Verhoeven with glorious hyperbole and Padilha with political conscience (both of them satire).  Verhoeven presents an America of 80's excess.  Padilha includes one that is 00's "dark and gritty".  

I think Verhoeven's works better because of less studio interference - but we don't live in a MUST LOVE/MUST HATE all caps paradigm.
