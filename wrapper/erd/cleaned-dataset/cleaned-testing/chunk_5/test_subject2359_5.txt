 No, those all exist.  Unless you mean one sub that combines them, which probably also exists. 




 "Allahu Akbar, you bitches!"

Just to watch Republican heads explode. 




 It's also got Prowlers on deck, so probably pre-2015. 




 No, a lack of precipitation is why California is in drought.  No policy causes that. 




  until the Emancipation Proclamation, the American Civil War had nothing directly to do with slavery.

The declarations of secession of various Confederate states, as well as statements by the leaders of the Confederacy, strongly prove otherwise. 




  Did anyone else get Desert Storm trading cards when they were a kid? 

I have almost the entire Topps set somewhere around here.
 




  The Falklands Conflict was a horrible, aggregious war, carried out by an imperialistic, jingoistic, conservative blight on this world. 

That's a pretty accurate description of the Argentine junta, yes. 




 There was some real weird shit Michelle Bachmann said about the Census a few years back. 




 1031 comments and only 374 karma. This is the biggest deficit I ever saw

Meh.

That annoyed me a bit. 




  Looks like the KV was on a bridge that was collapsed/taken out?

Yeah, I was thinking a bomb got dropped next to it. 




 The Sonoma/Napa Valleys are *not* located in the San Joaquin Valley. 




 Source?  It sounds really familiar, like "The 900 Days" by Salisbury. 




 You can always tell the *Forrestal*s by the elevator at the front of the angled flight deck. 




 Hume, CA, isn't really a town.  It's a Christian summer camp. 




  The other alarming thing is it sets a precedent for future presidents.

The precedent was set by *previous* Presidents.
 




 It very much is, actually. 




 3% fraud   abuse rate is not rampant.

That's "taking home office supplies" level of a nothingburger. 




  either by becoming so advanced that they would be capable of feats of stellar engineering on a massive scale,

Which ignores the fact that we wouldn't have seen the results yet, if they were far enough away.  A civilization twenty million light-years away could've turned their entire galaxy into a Dyson sphere nineteen million years ago, and we wouldn't know. 




  Oregon....do not waste your money on these.

Oregon makes good bars. 




  I'm sure a Stihl is better but you will pay a lot more for one.

And they last forever.  My 038 is more than 25 years old, and runs like new, even after heavy use every year (I live in a place where wood heat is pretty much standard, and have fallen hundreds of trees with it). 




 "Lifeblood" implies possession of a heart. 




 That is, maybe at Herculaneum or Pompeii, more modern archaeology uncovers something like "first editions" of the works of the more famous Greek and Roman philosophers or historians, and it's been found that the transcribed versions that became famous again in the Renaissance were not the same. 




 Those are on the way from ICE - the first will be called "Dancer's Lament." 




  The gun control folks want guns outlawed, but won't be taken seriously if they speak to their true intentions. 

Wow, a mind-reader.

Why are you wasting time on reddit when you could be using your powers of telepathy for greater good? 




 Anyone know of the evolution of the use of the word "discovered"?  I'm reading the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, and he uses the word in the sense of *revealing* by a party, rather than *finding out*.  That is, someone letting others in on a secret is referred to as "discovered to them," or "he discovered that fact" meaning he told someone else. 




  covering them would clearly produce massive ratings, and yet they have remained silent.

Yeah, we haven't heard anything about any of those.  Not at great length, endlessly, over and over. 




 So ... you can prove he said it? 




 "Excuse me sir, is this a god dam?" 




 1. No.

2. Putin would have to fall out of power.  He's the primary driver of Russian-NATO antagonism at the moment (not that he doesn't have plenty of enablers working for him). 




 What I do for a living (landscaping) wouldn't be particularly useful, but my general skillset would be, at least for keeping *me* alive.   




 It's snowing right now (I'm in the mountains these days), which is nice, but I was facetiously referring to the quality.  Tap water in the Valley is horrific. 




  Living in a country where crystal clear pure water literally flows out of the pipes

So you've clearly never lived in the Central Valley. 




 eBay is pretty hit-or-miss.

Honestly, if you don't really need the money, just donate them a local library - I dropped off about 200 or so (mostly history) books last time I changed towns, to save space. 




 /r/TheRedPill.

Just horrible, horrible people. 




 When it stops being a useful tool. 




 Why *wouldn't* they?  That's sort of the point. 




 Hey, look, *ad hominem* attacks.  What a surprise.

But then I thought, hey, everyone knows that.

It sounded like you didn't, which given the ignorance very prevalent on Reddit I took at face value.  And there aren't a *few* exceptions, there are many - let's add perjury, false identification, false presentation, and false police reports for example. 




  The First Amendment blocks the government from imposing consequences on you as a result of your speech.

No, it doesn't.   You can be punished for inciting panic, hate speech, slander, libel, etc. 




  Should a government institution have the leeway to break off association with someone due to the content of their speech?

... yes.  The answer is yes.

Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequence. 




  We all know what this is about nonetheless. 

We do?

Because I figure it's either the glassy-eyed (literally) loner in the center back, or the screwed-up perspective of the table, with illogical vanishing lines. 




 Beaver dam. 




 If they just work the night shift, they'll be fine.

 Why?  Because someone else did something good? 




  Could be one of the worst metrics that I have seen. 

Look at the site. 




 It should be slightly fuzzy and in B W, to reflect someone carefully adjusting the settings on an analog TV with a cable box trying to watch Cinemax.

I was a fucking wizard at that. 




  I don't care to or need to list any similarities in the agreement,

That's what I thought. 




  not once looking at the similarities. 

Because there aren't any.

Go ahead, go ahead and point out all the similarities between the agreement at Munich and the one with Iran.  List them.  Show us.  Actually prove something.

You can't, of course. 




  You can try to differentiate the difference between Obama placating Iran and Chamberlain placating Nazis all you want. 

Yes, I can differentiate, because they are *completely different* - Iran doesn't gain any territory, no one else gives up any territory without even having a say, Iran isn't a first-rate power that threatens to conquer its neighbors.

You, on the other hand, have no argument.  You have no substance. You have no point. 




  Obama is doing nothing but pulling a Neville Chamberlain. 

Thanks for proving your ignorance about what happened in 1938.  It has absolutely no parallels with the current situation. 




  And it's good to you because Obama

... is being a responsible world leader and dealing with problems through even-handed diplomacy instead of Friedman-esque "Suck on this!" bullshit.

and Iraq war,

Yes, it's nice to have a President who doesn't push for stupid shit that destabilizes the entire region.

and Palin.

... continues to be a moron, and a star of the Republican party.  Which says a lot, now doesn't it? 




 Because Obama, and Munich, and Benghazi. 




 Iraq?  Afghanistan?  Don't know if you'd heard, but we had a bit of a dust-up in both of them not too long back. 




  What does it look like when America declares total war on a country and slams their army into them as hard and fast as they can.

There are two recent examples. 




 Him and Fela stand in front of it and talk about it.

I'd say that qualifies. 




  And we're throwing it away.

No, we're replacing an old ship with newer ships. 




  I dont even know exactly what a taco is

I just feel really bad for you right now. 




 Back in the late '90s, during my Usenet days.  We were all part of a Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time) group, and had regional meetups - the ones I went to were in Berkeley and San Francisco. 




 None of those seem very portable. 




 The *de Gaulle* is actually notorious for having been built poorly, at least in parts.  For example, you generally want the flight deck of an aircraft carrier to be long enough to operate the aircraft you plan to deploy on it.  Also, you usually don't want the propellers to fall off. 




 You happen to know what supply ship that is in the background? 




 "Turbulent Skies" by  T. A. Heppenheimer goes into the basics, and I'd recommend it simply as a great history of (American) commercial aviation up until the late '90s. 




 Look at the graphic. 




 No, the Israelis were spying on the U.S. for Republicans, most of whom may as well renounce their American citizenship in favor of Israeli citizenship at this point. 




 I'd be fine with adding the *Izumo*s, but not the *Hyuga*s, as I haven't seen any sign their decks could withstand the heat from any STOVL aircraft.

I mean, if you're going to include the *Thai*-tanic, and the Italian and Spanish jump-jet carriers, you may as well include the *America*. 




 No, I was definitely speechless when that ended. 




 The U.S. has 10 aircraft carriers, not 20.

The *Wasps* and *Americas* are functionally light carriers, as they can carry a full load of AV-8Bs or F-35s when needed, and will usually carry at least a half-dozen or so. 




 God Save the Quenn!

I also wouldn't mind seeing this updated to separate the Nimitz/Fords, and the Americas/Wasps, which really shouldn't be grouped like this. 




 Placing them both centerline - one in front of the VLS and one behind, or both behind and superfiring - would do the same, while not resulting in one turret masking the other. 




 Brandon Lloyd refuses to obey gravity:

 That's not a framing nail.  Framing is done with 16s, not with oversized bright finishing nails. 




 I'm not really sold on that turret layout. 




 Best trailer ever - the music just matched the visuals so well. 




 I'll always associate them with "The Matrix" - "Dissolved Girl" is the song playing while Neo is sleeping in front of his computer during his first scene. 




 The late '90s were a mini-Golden Age for that - Seven, Saving Private Ryan, The Matrix ... all movies that just left you floored when the credits rolled. 




  Weather is great right now.

It's snowing here in Chester ... it won't last, but still. 




 It never really ended. 




 Bed, pillows, touch-sensitive lamp, whiteboard, custom built .45 and extra mag, bag of pretzels, bottle of beer, bunch of shit in my drawers like crossword puzzles, bottle of Pelikan ink, thesaurus, some old Wolverine comics (c. 1989), and 7.62mm ammo. 




 algemeiner.com: Telling Americans to be more loyal to Israel than America since whenever the fuck it was founded. 




 It isn't.  So, I drink instead. 




 Yeah, just like you when you were younger, and the middle-aged then thought what you were watching was shit.

Congratulations, you've perpetuated the cycle. 




 Yeah, but you could always sell them at some point.

 Lindsay Lohan, at about age 19.

Then cocaine apparently happened. 




 Praline and dick. 




 Especially because he feels pleasure while thinking this before dying - deep down, he knows B. is better than him, and is happy thinking about what R. and company is about to run into. 




 As a formerly religious atheist, I *can* go to church.  Nothing's stopping me.  And there's nothing I miss about not doing so. 




  He would be alive if he took his arrest like a man. 

So resisting arrest is now a death sentence.

Nice to know you'd have fit right in Nazi Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union. 




 Man, don't bother - it's the weekend, and it's /r/news.  All the Teabaggers are home from their jobs working the deep fryer, and are anxiously defending the latest Fox bullshit while reassuring themselves they'd be a millionaire if it wasn't for all of *Those People*. 




  do you know how they treat illegals in CA that are pulled over? they basically just let them go.

 Richard III was, for all his misbegotten, Shakespearean reputation as some kind of vile cripple, actually something of a badass on the battlefield.  His last charge against Henry (the future) VII being demonstrative - he had a battleaxe, and he knew how to use it.

 But it's got to be done right - Southern-style biscuits (preferably buttermilk), and pork sausage gravy made with milk and ground white pepper. 




 Yeah, but you have to keep doing it as it cooks, not just once.  Keep chopping away and stirring with the spatula.  It's not a hamburger, you don't just turn the meat once.  Also, using water is over-rated.  I just use the meat, no water.

And maybe use higher heat. 




 flipping it all once

There's your problem.

You're supposed to break it up as it cooks (usually with the edge of a spatula), until it's nice and crumbled. 




 Pretty sure fridges are artificial. 




  Nobody I've met from outside of Texas has a clue what chicken fried steak is

Sooo ... you haven't met many people from outside of Texas.

It's a really common dish throughout the country.
 




 VDH is such a goddamned fucking tool.

*Of course* the drought is the fault of liberal environmentalists ... just *because*.  Oh, and illegal immigrants.  Never mind that 80% of California's water use is agricultural (heavily fueled by said immigrants) or industrial (including fracking), it's all the damned Commies and wetbacks.

Should've stuck with Ancient Greek history, you neocon racist asshole. 




 Maybe she's just ugly and desperate. 




 Cheap beer. 




   How can you look at this in a bad light?

Because Obama. 




 Trust me, you stopped short.  Thankfully.
