 Its my real name. I was new to Reddit. I realize now how stupid my choice was. 




 My brother broke his neck a few years ago and has not cut his bright red hair since. Then he put dreadlocks in it.

So when people ask how he is going I put on a really sad voice and demeanor and say 

"Oh man, it's  been really hard on the whole family but we are getting through it together. Living with someone disabled isn't easy but its something I've had accept. My brother is a cripple: He's a white dude with dreads."

They laugh and I don;t have to go through the fucking story again.
