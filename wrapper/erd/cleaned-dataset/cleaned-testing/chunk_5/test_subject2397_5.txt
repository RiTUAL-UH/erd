 Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want to come back from this? - 

What's that supposed to mean? - 

Architecture is killing you, Ted, and it's killing us to watch it killing you.
You're like that goat with the washcloth.
You want it so bad, and every time the world tries to take it away from you, you keep grabbing it.
But you know what? It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

 Because I have to be an architect.
That's That's the plan.

Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on being a TV reporter.

Found it 




 I'd say that was only because of Zoe though and her motives, not him not enjoying the building process 




 She basically tells Ted to quit as an architect and just give up on everything he's worked for, saying it's killing him and killing them watching it kill him. She also compared his career to the rag that the goat was eating saying "why do you even want it so badly". To me it just seemed so anti-himym advice.

I don't really like Ted's answer though saying "that's the plan". It's not just the plan to him it's what he loves doing and I wish he had said that instead 




 Ambulence rides are like 6 grand though aren't they? Unless I'm dying of anaphylactic shock I'll just drive myself 




 I guess it could be a little ironic since in one episode Lily tells him it's a made up word 




 Patton is also rated PG from what I remember. I've never heard so many swear words in my life 




 In Mother Russia fedora tips you 




 I think that was the first time, and Barney does it in a later episode as well 




 My possible theory is that it's them pronouncing her name wrong, to me Scherb(o)tsky sounds much more correct and I don't think Robin ever pronounces it with an A sound 




 I have the green hemp shoes and the soles wore through in like 3 months, which is unusual for adidas I don't know what happened but I was sad 




 Trains are crazy. Not to be the physics nerd here but the amount of mass a train has even with little speed it still exerts an insane amount of force 




 I thought it was cool, but I guess it was more cool actually being there 









 I can look more like Kurt Cobain! 




 Kinda looked like that! Also sorry for the terrible quality 




 Preferably the SEM for this situation 









 My friend said it great, in LoTR they made every single orc, the most copy pasteable thing imaginable, to look different and therefore awesome 




 Sorry for the late reply but yeah like the other person said it's just not likely, especially if they were both goth to your point 




 That is very cool. It's also super foggy right now so fitting 




 Been to WI a few times my self, on a scale of amazing to orgasmic how great is frozen custard? 




 You forgot this / 




 Wasn't Lily a goth chick from high school all the way through freshman year of college? Not saying it couldn't happen but to me it seems a bit of a clash, I guess it's for a joke though 




 The booster and the cars with the metal bottoms not that plastic. Gives them way more momentum 




 It's really no wonder Ted is hung up on Robin forever. They live together and Robin basically puts him in a state of perpetual jealousy, or rather they put each other in that state. Sure ex's can be friends but not like that 




 It definitely has some of my fav episodes: sexless inkeeper, playbook, last cigarette, girls vs. suits, etc. I thought it was good as well 




 In WA it's like 9.50 now so very different across states 




 Never done Greyhound but Megabus is definitely the way to go. It was comfier than my plane ride 




 Aint nothing like a Liz Lemon party cuz a Liz Lemon party is mandatory

edit:thanks for the fix it's been awhile 




 The amount of history and lore that came from this is actually amazing. In those few weeks books were written, memes were created, and much time was wasted typing "up" or "down" 




 I played Slime volleyball with my roomate last month ha. I still got it 




 Hans Gruber, international bandit 




 Had you said blinds I would've been freaked out 









 No but his mom is always a special 




 This would be more creepy if he wasn't so loveable  




 We can build one in Tacoma. Oh wait.. 




 Terrorists last word's are "begosh" 









 I believe there's a song about this 




 I thought it was kinda funny. Maybe I'm just missing the show more than I thought though 




 True. I think a big reason I'm making a bigger deal of it is because I've hung out with OG katelin a couple times this semester ( in college) so probably remembering it more than usual 




 It does seem to be pretty common. Thanks 




 That is very true, I think you're right 




 She's my friend's girl's friend and we may all go on this double date thing this Friday. Is it weird that she has the same name? Well I know it's weird but more like is this a deal breaker?
---   

Also I've met like 5 girls with this name in the last year so I've pretty much given up on trying to meet a girl with a different name

TL;DR Thanks guys
 




 The girl I may take out on a date has the same name as my last. Weird? 




 Didn't expect to cry today but umm.. okay. :( 




 Am I doing this right? 




 Not asking this girl out because I was leaving for college like 5 months later. Shoulda gone through with it 




 Marshal is decent looking ( I think? I'm a guy) and a lawyer. Plus funk band

Lily is pretty hot, kindergarten teacher, and hot dog eating champ 




 I find tinsel distracting 




 He also betted Marshal off 




 Is that Spokane, Washington? I always wondered b/c I live by Spokane and it's a big city but didn't really think anyone outside of WA would know about it 




 Well she had very recently moved to NY at that time so yeah guessing they were friends but not yet really good friends yet  




 I'm hardly an expert on this but I believe this is why you will suddenly get the urge to poop. Your internal sphincter will get a signal and relax enough for it to exit 




 And just to mention the external one is voluntary but there's an internal sphincter that is smooth muscle and beyond conscious control 




 I suppose but how about when the majority of people worked in factories, or the Great Depression where people barely even had jobs. Then they worked at least 40 hrs a week and barely got paid for it 




 I always have at least 2 lab tests on Dead Week. Makes it a serious time crunch 




 I keep seeing this on Reddit but really what generation had this luxury? It's pretty much been hard work for America right from the beginning 









 Well apparently OPs other repost 5 hrs ago wasn't successful enough so he brought out the big reposting guns 




 If you're thinking about Owen I like using there computers alot more than Holland Terrell. the seats are way comfier and they are always open 




 Local bounty hunter. Doin the King's dirty work 




 Started selling Kirby vacuums. I did quit only like 2 weeks in b/c I knowingly went in to it thinking it was a scam but it still was a bad experience 




 Immunology. Not only is the material very expansive and detailed, the professor is also insanely hard. The tests are 100 points except for the final which is 200 and they are very tricky mult. choice and lots of in-depth application short answer questions. It's a very interesting class but damn it's difficult 




 Usually really happy/fun but occasionally mellow/down. Sort of depends on what I was thinking about that day 




 My biggest complaint was that it had the worst search function of all time 




 That's the worst part. Slutty graphic tee's for junior high schoolers 




 I know when Ted was in Barney's dressing room Lily comes in asking for Ted that Robin needs him. I can't remember if she said best man or not though 




 You would have to say Thank you for browsing random 




 The depression under your nose is known as the Philtrum 




 Where do the hoes go?? 




 How bout when people out of state drive on our roads? Do they then have to pay? 




 Sort of like the Styx concert
 




 And Spike learns you can't fix everything by kicking it 




 The year I owned a Ruckus was the best of my life. I owned those open roads. 30 mph at a time 




 My day always starts off with 3 eggs in a breakfast burrito with Pepper jack. Best breakfast ever 




 I'll have to see. Usually nurses and the like love me because my veins pop out a lot 




 That would be an impressive resume if she could actually do all those things 




 Same here! Although last time I donated I got really faint and my arm hurt for days. It also took a really long time, like I saw people come and go in the time I donated. I should try again though.  




 I tried it last Halloween. I don't really like sugary drinks but it definitely tasted like a tootsie roll 




 That's just ResNet (happened in Stephenson). With deadweek here I'm sure you can expect more of it in the next 2 weeks 




 Sports games + Finals 




 The style reminds me of a TF2 character 




 Except what's in those what appear to be locked drawers at the bottom? 




 I've noticed in my travels that if you are anything more East than like Chicago people will assume D.C., but for us Seattelites most people around here assume the state 




 Like Pepperoni only sexy 




 Hey, Reel Big Fish and Streetlight Manifesto will always be on my ipod 




 I feel like skinny jeans will always be a thing. At least for me I have pretty skinny legs so they are just better fitting 




 Who told you to put the balm on? 




 I just chug water before going to bed. Works every time 




 Boot up the computer and ask /r/askreddit what to do 




 Live in Seattle and work in a pharmacy. Either in a hospital there or at a retail place 




 For one turn off your phone, even one text can get your mind distracted for minutes. Also (IMO) studying can be a lot like working out. It's hard to focus at home with so many distractions and going to the library to study is the equivalent of going to a gym 




 Best of Van Halen. Panama is such a kick ass song 




 Don't feel bad about driving slow, especially down hills. It is much more manageable even if you start to slide 




 In WA it's half that.. but I'm sure it's quite different in NY 




 And why did I continue to watch it till the end? 




  It's just too much money for what you get

Definitely this.  I walk everywhere nowadays and these kinds of shoes just don't hold up anymore. I still buy them though.. Good insoles are important though 




 Ochem lab. Most people did not take the "slowly pour" instructions seriously with conc. H2SO4 and the vials basically erupted when people poured the stuff in. One person got serious burns on their arm 




 There are a lot of houses on Greek row that could potentially be awesome if they weren't so run down 




 /r/beertrade 




 the other half is in Iceland. According to pics anyways... 




 Brings back the horrible memories of after-school care in the lunch room for me 




 Hot water plus a cold beer and some alone time. At least for me 




 I love how you drew the fracture in with it. Good anatomy! 




 I don't know who you are but that's blasphemy 




 I've pretty much always hated Lily. But yeah the worst part is the writers acting like her actions are justified. She always does terrible things and at the end of the episode they try to spin it on some way that makes it alright. And yet, hardly anything she does is right. 




 blues Brothers will always be my favorite movie. It's hilarious, its got blues music throughout, and more talented actors then you can shake a stick at 




 And why does Irfanview not have 1366x768 as a default picture resize option? Or Gimp2 as well..
