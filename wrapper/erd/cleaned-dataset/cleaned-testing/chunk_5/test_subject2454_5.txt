 What'cha gon'd do wit all dat gold?  All dat gold inside your...fold? 




 So perfectly looped.  Seamless. 




 This is terribly inefficient.  




 Keep swallowing alcohol until your brain erases the memory of such a horrific incident. 




 Possibly government survey reasons.  Or oversight. 




 YEAH, BUT YOU STILL CAN'T EXPLAIN THE TIDES!!!! 




 I know Machida lost one of those fights bad.  Like I think the first one was when Bones tried to murder him.  Not sure about the second one.  Maybe that was the decision loss to Phil? 




 Oh my god.  What if Jones seriously gets poked in the eye by some retarded fan who hates him or something? 




 Double cock block! 




 Yeah, but let's see what it looks like with the Dick Motta years.  "Dick Motta! Yeah we got him!" "Jason and Jimmy!  Yeah we got em!"  "Jamal Mashburn! Yeah we got him!"

 Constitutional rights violated all over the map, and you think his comment is a joke? 




 Let's not forget the CEO's extremely cringey "Every man must care for his own soul" post after the fappening fiasco.  He didn't have the balls to just say that he didn't like the bad publicity (which would be completely understandable), but he had to go an make a moral argument, which was weakened by the fact that he allowed the sub to remain for as long as he did, enjoying the benefits of the increased site traffic. 




 Of course it has 




 Oh boy, someone's in trouble now! 




 ahh yes, who can forget /r/cutefemalecorpses 




 Lol, the admins were definitely not quick on the ban.  They let that shit slide as long as they were getting clicks and ad revenue, but once Anderson Cooper did his story, and that one guy (violet something?) was doxxed, they swept in on their fake moral high horse. 




 Type in "boobies" 




 Sell it to Hollywood for further inaccuracies. 



















 I want a Jagr sitcom 




 Could we please get a British referee? 




 That would have to be marketed by the greatest geniuses of our time.  Like, Hawking level marketers. 




 Here is a breakdown from urser /u/twewy

[Dude, that opener + combo was a work of art.
Right feint, left ready, sees the guard go up, shoves the left in there, follows it up a combo to make sure he can't afford to put his guard down, right hook, left hook, right uppercut, left -- just kidding! Right hook. Change it up, make your opponent frustrated and impatient.
Tattoo man wants to look, he wants to peek, you don't take six hits blind with nothing to show for it. Ben waits for the peek, and shoves another left in there, this time an uppercut, following with an opportune right hook to take advantage of the weakened guard as it moves inward, over compensating for the uppercut that was just received.
Tattoo man realizes his mistake, and solidifies his guard again -- but wait, we've seen this pattern before! You don't win fights in a ball guarding all day!
Ben's been building this guy up. Tattoo man hasn't gotten a single SWING out, let alone a solid hit. Ben knows he'll want to make a move soon, so he pauses, just for half a second. Where previously he had driven half a dozen punches in to make sure no room was given, he waits this time. Ben knows the timing perfectly. Tattoo man takes the bait, there, the guard is dropping, right arm is swinging back, this is going to be big, but fatally slow to start! Ben's faster, he already sees how this will play out. Duck and weave, quick left disrupts the knock out haymaker, veers it off course, and the motion he's practiced thousands of times puts him under now-wild right. Tattoo man hits air, can't adjust his momentum, he's vulnerable, he's open! Bam, right hook straight into the jaw, lights out. Insurance left misses, target's already down.
TL;DR Ben's a cold-hearted, calculating bastard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2xzs0z/how_acting_tough_can_get_you_knocked_out_in_20/cp50xkj) 




 Hit the lawyer. 














 Thank you.  I fucking hate it when people tell us about something really interesting or unique like this, and then leave the imagery to our shitty imaginations. 




 maybe 




 Rob Marinovich. 




 Meh.  Xtreme Coture is way overrated.  They're not exactly a championship making team.  Gray Maynard is the best they've got.  While that's a pretty awesome fighter right there, there are much better teams out there for her [Meisha] to train with. 




 well then 




 Well, it's not NOT true. 




 He's super cereal, guys. 




 I don't understand the compulsion that people have to come into the comments of a picture like this and try to make crass jokes.  Even if Reddit is full of dumbass teenagers, this is a new level of stupid. 




 hilarious 




 A lady will only get the title whan she deserves it

Wow, that's the stupidest fucking thing I've read on the internet, and I just read those tweets in this post. 




 FRY's?  Like a proper Fry's Electronics?  Cause the one in Torrance sucks ass.  It's a small shitty warehouse type building and doesn't have half the inventory of a normal Fry's. 




 You asked to see me after class, coach? 




 are you hiring?

 10th round?  What a reach! 




 Yeah, I have no problem paying Tony, considering what a sewer tank this thing would be without him. 




 I can't remember the exact explanation, but possibly something to do with hive mind voting patterns. 




 Reddit has built in downvotes.  Nothing will EVER have 100% popularity as a result of this.  Even if 7000 people upvoted and 0 people downvoted, reddit would show that 10,000 people upvoted and 3000 downvoted. 




 People apparently not understanding that different women have different bodies, and they're not all supposed to look the same.

 Military kill history doesn't mean shit in combat sports.  There have been a lot of soldiers/marines come and go in the UFC.  How many became champions?

The only one who has close to a shot is Tim Kennedy, and even that is dubious at best. 




 This is some Chael Sonnen level shit.

 No need to get all ethnic with beef. 




 Damn.  I never thought of it like that. 









 sonofabitch!

poor bleach is just so confusing 




 I would rather they develop Moncrief.  A lot of teams are turning away from developing in house talent in favor of spending big money on name guys.  Think of how much money the colts could save and spend elsewhere by not getting Marshall.

Is Moncrief not the long term future of that WR corp? 




 Hahaha that's why it so funny lol haha lol. Get it? 




 Seriously though, this sounds atrocious. 




 I thought it was gonna be one of those ironically titles game gifs where the opposite happens. Then, he pulled off a perfect fucking flip, just as the title suggests. I believe in nothing. 




 That's just dumb. You're always gonna leave the end of the loaf toasted, so when you want toast later, one side will be super hard and the other will be properly toasted.

 I think Muhammad Ali originally said that about Don King.

 I see that now 




 why would you want to shake sense into that?  let it just keep going. 




 yup.  90% dudes trying to get laid. 




 so everything is ok, then? 




 oh look, no pictures of the fucking crop circles 




 Wasn't there a scene like this in the movie "The Dreamers?"  Where Eva Green's character and her brother nakedly chase around a third guy who has a picture of her in his boxers, and they catch him, and the brother holds him down and Eva takes down his boxers to reveal his dick with the picture underneath it?

Right?  Remember that scene?

 What about our schools, and like, such as, the Iraq? 




 No, just ineptly understaffed. 









 Are you comparing extremely talented actresses to standup comedians like Any Schumer, Sarah Silverman, and Joan Rivers?  Because I don't think that Fey and Pohler could do what Rivers could do. 









 probably why no one has ever heard of him 




 There is zero editorializing here. I literally copy/pasted everything word for word. 














 Probably not, because they don't do that.

 Thanks, Captain 




 There's no question in my mind that if Palhares dove for that leg and got a hold of it, Jones would do something dirty or borderline dirty to get out of it, and then throw his palms up like he's completely innocent and didn't know he violated a rule.

Hammil GOAT. 




 Were Lesnar and Carwin even tested?  Or were the NSAC and UFC too afraid of the obvious results? 




 EVERYBODY is pretty sure Hendricks is on the juice. 




 This is what happened. 




 It's precisely BECAUSE it's not funny that it will reach the front page. 




 In that case, rules don't apply.

 Damn, I didn't Jon Jones went into rehab, and immediately signed out and walked right out to his bentley.  That shit is kind of hilariously gangster. 




 I'd fuck a man that looked like that.
