 "Come play with us" :D what is the name of that hotel?! :) 




 Ha, ha I hated frozen. My twin absolutely loved it so all I ever heard was let it go and it just made me hate the film, also my niece watches it on repeat. I can't escape the evil!! :p 




 It's amazing to think that life is being created right now. I know we've never met but we don't have to its just a great thing that you, a stranger over the internet - - to me anyway, is going to have a kid and you can watch them grow and be there for them. Congratulations again 




 I enjoyed that film, it was nice to watch. I also really liked the message :) 




 I think mulan is mine to. She is such a strong character and I love how she manages to break few  of what's expected of her so she can be happy. 




 I love the lion king I remember the first time I ever watched it. What a great movie. 




 Oh I love Aladdin!! I love how Aladdin and Jasmine both have troubles yet they fix each other's, he gives her a sense of freedom and she gives him the freedom to live comfortably (no more poverty). Plus they both love each other which is great. 




 Well I'm taking part in /r/nofap so I could handle the masterbation part, I'm pretty young so I haven't had sex yet but as long as I could still have kids I would take the money but I would donate a lot of it since money doesn't buy happiness, I would however leave enough for me and my family to lead a comfortable life. 









 Come back here when your child is born and let us all know if you have a boy or a girl :) (if you want too :) ) 




 Ha, ha :D  




 Thats good, hopefully things will only get better for you. 




 That's terrible, I'm sorry you felt the need to do that. I hope everything's ok now? 




 That's great to hear! I'm sorry about your husband but at least things are good now :) 




 You're welcome, everyone's important, even if they don't know it. 




 Your welcome :) 




 Like I've said to a few people already I'm sorry you felt that you had to do it in the first place but know that there are people that care about you. I hope everything turns out ok. 




 I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but if you need someone to talk to I'm here.  




 I hope things do/did get better for you, I hope you got/get the help you deserve and I can tell, from that one sentence you love your parents. They love you too and if you ever need any help ask them. Things can change in an instant and they might be the ones to make that change. I hope things are good for you now and if they aren't I hope they get better. 




 I'm sorry that you felt like you had to do it in the first place and I hope that things in your life take a turn for the better. 




 I don't know what you've went through that made you feel like death was the only way out but you have people that love and care for you deeply. Please if you ever come close to it again, ask them for help. It might seem difficult, whatever is happening to you but you can beat it. 




 You might not be religious but you'll be in my prayers. I'm not qualified in anyway but if you ever need anyone to talk to my pm box is always open. You don't even have to say your name but one talk can change everything. 




 It's nice to hear that things are better for you. Hopefully you won't have to go through anything like that again. I hope things keep getting better and better for you. 




 I'm happy to hear that, stay strong.  




 I'm sorry you went through it to begin with, I hope things get better for you. You shouldn't have to adapt. You might not be religious but I'll say a prayer for you today. 




 Don't blame yourself. Maybe some help would've stopped it from happening but from what you said it sounds like stuff was already really messed up for him. 




 I hope everything's ok for you now.  




 How are things for you now? 




 I'm sorry that you had to go through whatever you went through to begin with but at least you're here now. 




 God bless, congratulations on becoming a dad. I hope you two have a smooth pregnancy and you have a happy, healthy boy or girl :) 




 Same sex school? That's too bad you should try going into a nearby town. 




 Ha, ha I get that with the amiibos :) 

Well I guess to start you should buy a starter pack. I take it you're getting 2.0? If you are then I reccomend either the avengers starter pack or the merida and stitch toy box pack. Then you can buy other characters. 

You probably already know this but you can get power discs which give you new toys, paints etc and some are rare so there's a lot to trade and collect. 

You can buy characters from the first game and they work just fine on 2.0 but don't buy any playsets from the first one since they don't work on 2.0

Most stores that sell characters do deals on them. For example the ASDA (I'm in Scotland) near me sells 2 for 15 and they sell packs like the girl power pack which gives you violet, rapunzel and vanellope for 13, so look out for deals and also check eBay and Amazon etc. Some characters there are overpriced, like Elsa for example in store she costs 10, online she costs between 20-50. You can get really good deals online though, for example you can get some older characters for 3 when they normally cost 10. 

If you have any questions just ask. 




 Thanks :) 




 Hey sorry I'm all out, I've given them all away :( 




 Your welcome :) 




 Sorry I'm all out now but I'll make another post when I get new characters 




 Hi, I'm going to give you the code :) 




 Hey I'll message you maleificent :) 









 Scotland - I find family very important, even though I argue with my brothers and sisters I love them more than life itself.
 




 Can you link them please? 




 I really want aladdins flying carpet and I'm willing to give 5 power discs for it. 




 Hey, don't mention it, I don't use them since I don't play it on ios or pc so I may as well give them to people who can get some use out of them. Like I said though I might not be able to find them all but if I fin maleificent or venom they're yours :) 




 Here's hopping. They're pretty good at delivering what people want. A lot of people wanted Aladdin and Jasmine and we got them. 




 Awesome!! :D 




 It would be great to have star wars imagine the possibilities, we could make our own star wars worlds!! 




 Hey I've edited the post, can you give it a read since so many people want stitch and merida I'm going to pick someone at random.  Yeah that's what I bought when I got the game

 I love Alice!! Have you ever played Alice: madness returns? 




 Is it normal for parents to freak out like that where you live? Don't worry you're not in any trouble she's over reacting. I'm from Scotland and whenever I start dating my parents just say things like 

"Ooooh do you kiss her?"

And stuff like that in joking voices, I've only had two girlfriends but they're really cool about it, I mean they joke about it and stuff but when they've met them they've been great, friendly and not at all embarassing. Plus they only do those joke voices for a few days. 

Anyway good luck keep us posted. 




 I think a fuppa is a weird way of saying pubes? If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.  




 I agree they already have a ton of gravity falls themed items so we should be able to act as some characters. 




 Oh he'd be great 




 No problem, hope you enjoy it :) 




 I know me too but I wish they would ad  more story, I know a lot of kids play it but it's mainly older people so they could make some more stories for the playsets. I would love to see Alice. 




 No problem :) 




 Yeah no problem, it also comes with rapunzel :) 




 Ok no problem :) 




 No problem :) 




 Hey no problem I'll message you now :) 




 Ok no problem, I'll message you now :) 




 I would love to see Mulan, lilo, maybe in some shape aeriel they could make underwater worlds which could let normal characters have breath metres and let characters like aeriel, or nemo explore under the sea.  




 Hey, I'd love to help out but I have a three week study period comming up soon so I will only be able to write once or twice a week, is that ok? 




 I might have to find a couple but here, in my hand I have: 

* ~~vanellope, rapunzel and violet (one card, only takes one of your codes away so you can pick another)~~

* ~~Aladdin~~

* ~~Jasmine~~

* ~~Falcon~~

* ~~Maleificent~~

* ~~Gamora/Star Lord~~

* ~~Merida/Stitch~~

I have more and I'll add them when I find them :)


EDIT 1: I'm glad I've been able to give some away, I've crossed out the ones I've given away. I was going to do this on a first come first serve bases but since so many people want stitch and merida I'll pick someone at random tonight. When I find them I should have maleificent, venom, hulk, gamora and around 4 more but I can't promise those ones since I'm not exactly sure where I've sat them but if I find them during the week I'll make a new post. I hope the codes I've given away so far are being enjoyed, I'll keep you all posted :)

Edit 2: I've given away every code I can find now, sorry if you never got one. I hope you all enjoy the codes that I've given. If I find any more I'll make a new post, sorry again if you never got one. 




 I have both, they really are great games. I did enjoy the playsets but to be  honest the missions are fun but not amazing. You can unlock some awesome things and do some really cool stuff but some times they are pretty repetitive. I think the incredibles, lone ranger and toy story playsets were the best and you can get most pretty cheap on Amazon. For the second one the playsets give some awesome maps like New York city.

I suggest you buy 2.0 since you can pretty much buy everything from 1.0 for the toy box with game currency (sparks), don't worry you don't pay for them you collect them. Plus the characters from 1.0 and the power discs can all be used in 2.0. Some of the best characters in my opinion are:


Violet (incredibles) she can go invisible and has some nice moves and force fields


Maleificent - when you get her wings she is amazing, her magic is strong but slightly slow which is a disadvantage but she is a great character


Stitch - he can't fly which is too bad because I've become so used to that but he can climb on walls, roll around in a ball and he is just an awesome character


Vanellope - she is unique because she can glitch around she says some funny stuff but I might be bias since I loved the movie


Alladin and Jasmine - both can jump pretty high, both look great and have decent voice acting, both have good projectile attacks and alladin can get a second costume if you buy the power disc


Merida - definitely bias here but I'm scottish like her which makes me absolutely love her 


Spiderman - I love his web swinging and wall climbing


Dash - his running is fun but a bit hard to control sometimes

Elsa - she can freeze enemies and is surprisingly strong 

I like basically every character except for the cars so I could go on for ever but a few honourable mentions go to 

Mrs incredible

Rapunzel

Gamora

Tinkerbell

Iron man

And hulk 









 Oh that makes a lot of sense, thank you I've been wondering about this for a while now. 









 I drink a lot of milk 




 ***F***ight ***A***gainst ***P***orn ***Z***ombies 




 Right now it's 20.14 




 I don't know if it'll be your thing but check out clean bandit, their songs: real love and rather be are both very good. They're not trance music but it's worth a listen. 




 Awesome!! I wouldn't call that doodling though. You have real talent.  




 Who is he? 




 Actually we now know who he was, he turned out to be a polish man. 




 1).  I kind of hope he does but I'm happy that they never took away ricks hand.

2). I agree  it could be a while but I'm excited for when we finally do.

3). I loved Carol and Daryl going to get Beth but the premier an  midseason finale were both amazing. 









 Thanks this actually helps. The main reasons I want to do it are that I love history and I would love to be able to inspire people, get to know them and like you said see them learn.  




 I suggest you wear black or grey dress trousers and a white shirt (maybe a tie) and some leather shoes. 









 Thank you I'll go there now. 




 Here everyone is paid the same. For example a male doctor would be paid the same as a female doctor and a male chef would be paid the same as a female chef, presuming of course they were at the same level in their career.  




 Wow sorry about your brother.  




 Here there are equal amounts of all teachers to be honest. Say for example there were five English teachers then there would be five-ish (although some subjects might need a few more if a lot of students tend to take it like biology and chemistry) for maths, Spanish, history, modern studies, music etc.  









 Actually they were always very anti-semetic. The people who created the KKK were bitter that the south had lost the civil war and that the slaves had been freed. So they made their robes and tried to scare recently freed slaves by telling them that they were the ghosts of dead generals from the war. As time went on they gained and lost popularity but they were at their height of power in the 1920's. Kkk parades were a common sight and they had thousands of members over the US. There was one incident in a small town, I can't remember the name right now, where almost every white man was a member of the klan and as such they could commit any form of racial crime without consequences since even law men had become members, this made life hell For pretty much anyone that wasn't a white Christian. 




 Do you enjoy what you do? I love history (I'm 15) and I've aced every test. I'm seriously considering going to university and training to become a history teacher. I have a few questions, if you could answer any I'd be so grateful:


* Do you enjoy it?


* What grades do you need to get into a university? (I know every one is different but what did you take? Also I'm in Scotland, UK so that will likely make a difference).


* Have you ever had a student that you truely liked (inspired you/you inspired them) or one that you just hated?


Anything else you could tell me about your job would be great!! thank you

 You too :) 




 No, don't worry about it. Edging is when you fap but don't orgasm but people on here who say they edge also say it normally leads to them having to reset their counter. 




 Hi, I'm 15 too!! :) (almost 16) and I've had a few good streaks but I left for a while and I came back yesterday. For me it made me more active (which was weird since I'm an indoor gamer type person), I felt more confident, procrastinated less and I'm just happier in general. Again I was a bit socially awkward. After I stopped I swore to myself that I would keep doing these things and so far I have. Even though it was hard I've forced myself to only game at weekends cause it was taking up too much of my time and study during weekdays, also I go out with my friends a lot more now, I used to only go out once in a blue moon. It is difficult and I don't know if we "need" a sexual release but going without one was fine with me (even though it was hard at times). If you do happen to fap don't get down on yourself, just learn from it and start again. Also if you decide that you don't want to do nofap just don't watch porn. Seriously if you think about it, its just filmed prostitution and you're watching other people have sex, finally read some of the horror stories on here, some guys watched so much porn that they ended up with erectile dysfunction. Good luck in your decision. 




 Oh I should mention thay I think it's total crap but my sister keeps saying it's not a porno and I want to settle an argument. 




 Post on /r/books 




 Yeah we have a different education system. 




 Thanks that's actually a big help. 




 Oh I like that I hope the op picks that one. 




 Hi, I'm from Scotland and I will be going into fifth year after the summer. When I leave School I want to go to university and train to become a history teacher and I was wondering what qualifications I would need to do this. I understand that I'd need history, maths, English etc. I'm doing fairly well in all of my subjects, besides maths. In all of them I am NAT 5 but in maths I'm NAT 4. Will this be enough to get me into a university to train since history doesn't really require maths. So basically I'm asking:

* What qualifications do I need

And

* Is a NAT 4 award in maths enough or do I need to continue it?

Please help, anything is appreciated. 




 They said 1 though :( 




 Kim Kardashian!! 




 Yeah I have halo. I'll send you my gamertag but I won't be online till at least Saturday or Friday because I have exams all week. 




 I normally put sugar on it and oh my god!! Try it chocolate porridge is amazing!!! 




 Do you put anything on it like salt, sugar or maple syrup and have you ever tried chocolate porridge? 




 Here it's 7.30pm exactly and I'm dreaming of it :) 




 Mmmm I actually can't wait till tomorrow now, I really want porridge. 




 I normally always eat cereal with a glass of milk or orange juice. If not that then I have porridge or a piece and sausage or egg and toast or a fry up. Most commonly cereal or porridge though. Oh and I live in Scotland. 




 Aaaw even though the surprise was ruined your having another kid!! :D Good for both of you, congratulations. 




 Well yeah but I mean like simple physical pain. Obviously crying if you seriously injure yourself is different. 




 Depends. If you cry when you get physically hurt e.g falling it's a sign of weakness. Cry emotionally e.g after the death of a loved one and it's a sign of humanity, love and strength. 




 I don't get it. It's just a picture of a door 




 I don't care about al Gore and who he influenced I make up my own decisions and I understand the science behind. 









 I'm nit American I only know who al Gore is through reddit. That guy has done nothing to influence me. 




 I never heard that it would happen in any of those years. It's just a fact maybe if you wouldn't be so ignorant and researched the science behind it you would understand. 




 It's hardly bullshit. 




 Humans simply because it would be better for the entire world. Wings = less planes = Less CO emissions = healthier earth. (I know the  should be down the bottom but I'm on my tablet and can't put it there).  




 Like Pac man, flappy bird, racing games and tons more. 




 Teacher, life guard or gynecologist.
