 how did you find this? 




 apathy? 




 HAHAHAHA 














 Its going to be slow 




 They would literally remove all impetus I have for using third-party apps if they made it easier to input events into the calendar.

Apps like Fantastical do a MARVELOUS job with this and I don't see whats so complicated about going ahead and doing it in house. Is such a thing patented? 

If you're not sure what I mean, look here: https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone 




 Notes is meant to be basic...no one told you to toss evernote...but for most people this will do 




 Only because I'm going to IMMEDIATELY start using it.  







































 is this before or after killing a platoon of people? 









 Racism isn't limited to nooses and the N-word 



















 I mean, even the Reminders app took a hit now because I needed an easy check-list, not just hand-deleting lists

I can't imagine CLEAR sticking around much longer either.  




 Evernote just died.

I probably won't need any of these task apps I just downloaded either 




 iOS 9 was huge 




 the cop tossed her around WHEN SHE WAS WALKING AWAY

His feelings got hurt and he had to make an example. He's trash 




  (Fucking Osama was in Langley!!)

Theres no proof of this.  




 You know what? I don't even care.  
























 the only people who ran were the ones he pulled a gun on 




 A wannabe zimmerman 




 Not even pepper spray 




 Theres only 3 cops. You expect them to harass EVERYONE? 




 Precisely. She WAS leaving and the cop just had to make an example out of someone.  




 He's the ranking officer too 




 Go to hell 




 You're armed with a baton, taser, and gun...   You go straight for the gun. 









 This guy was the ranking officer on the scene too. Just insane. 




 which one?

Read the story dumbass

These kids were invited to the pool party and all had passes. 

Everyone detained was black 




 Definitely a gun. That yellow thing that stayed on his belt was the taser 




 which is why no one who wasn't black wasn't arrested or detained?

 i'm interested to see this being true or not because according to this twitter account https://twitter.com/k1dmars it was HIS party and he lives in the area.  




 Eh...military plays by different rules 




 inexcusable behavior by the cops 




 When he pulled the gun out around 3:10...wow

No excuse for that. None. 
 




 I needed this.  




 MARTA was supposed to go down past Griffin 














 its still cool to me that this is even possible. 




 Still hungry by noon 




 Look at MARTA and tell me NIMBY isn't a problem 





























 OK. So where are the suspects? 




 Pakistan, ladies and gentlemen  









 Well how many would you expect? 




  When we evolved the genes necessary to speak complex language, that was just protein creation at the base of it

Yeah, you don't understand genes 




 it IS legal though 




 Great Episode 




 This is these people's proudest day of their kids and you can't think of anything better than than threatening them under the law for a joyous outburst.

I wish there was a hell for you to go to for even REMOTELY suggesting any use of law enforcement.

You're the worst type of person. 




 Its a goddamn graduation.

Go to hell 









 People hate Obama, but the good thing is that you know he's smart enough to never even think this would be a remotely good thing to say. He's not an idiot.  




 I've experienced this in the lab personally (am a male) 



















 Turns out metadata is good for something 




 Look on his Youtube channel. He is a KNOWN troll:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVUWVqBhcBe3jMK0eYjG-wg 




 Its as christian as the followers want to make it. 

Its not my money 














 Just asking people not to cheer.

People always cheer at ceremonies. Bringing the law into this is flatout insanity. 

That principal needs his ass kicked.  




 Prison?

I'm not religious by any stretch, but none of this is illegal. 




 Jesus prefers seabass over salmon 




 Is he really? 

I mean what about everyone in the congregation who gives him that money?  




 What always never made sense to me was why he never went for a lesser or used jet 




 I'm in the wrong business 









 To even involve the legal system is bullshit and you know it.  




 ARREST warrants?

Man get the hell out of here. I hope a cop beats you for chewing gum.  









 I guess you weren't alive during the New Deal 














 This is UNREAL 




 Shipping is next.

Do it Elon 




 Its like UStream for your iphone 




 Of course it was 




 Rather Ice Man 




 This was AWESOME 




 The hammer just got DRIZZOPED! 




 FI-fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu 




 Its really a major middle finger to skeptics  



















  we are 51 states 

 #3232;_ #3232;
 




 Its amazing how things slowed up once the Cold War "ended"

Asia is lapping us 









 why not? 




 Its because most of reddit is white. 




 Most of Reddits white college aged population? Of course not.

/s 









 There were a lot of people who laughed at his comment. He's not alone 














 OUTLOOK 





























  He would be entitled to time served no matter what

Not necessarily. 

And he CLEARLY played a role in obstruction in a major case doing what he did. Thats not something worth moderate punishment 




 Except he IS more or less a white supremacist. 




 how's life under that rock? 









 He gets time served 




 #IF YOU'RE TIRED OF HAVING THE FIFA PRESIDENT ALL ALWAYS AT THE FRONT...DANCING IN ALL YOUR VIDEOS....TAKING ALL YOUR MONEY...


#**...COME TO ~~Death Row~~  UEFA!!!** 




 Do you know how hard it is to shoot at someones legs?

Within 20-30 feet, people with blades are deadly 














 $1000 is a steal 




 $1000 to meet with a former first lady and secretary of state? Thats a bargain 




 What did people expect? 




 I read the whole WIRED story, the DPR assassination transcripts, and watched the documentary.

He really tried to kill those people. 




 or you could type it before hand then paste it 







































 That isn't proof of a biological link in the manner you've stated.  









 First of all, you imply that sexuality and gender identity are choices:
 They are not.


Has this been *demonstrably* proven?? 




 DAFUQ?! 









 Why A.Q. Khan is alive, i'll never know. 




 Or not...

It could be an effort to change the perception leaving the country in the media.

I mean, suppression of NK's abilities works well in maintaining the narrative.
 









 Thanks U.N.! 














 someone from /r/Libertarian  will do this now 




 if you're client facing, then yes. 



















 Not completely apparently. Some cold air definitely froze my legs that day. 




 Be warned...sometimes those doors aren't SUPER tightly sealed.

Once I damn near froze my toes off and when I woke up I seriously though I had frostbite 









 Evil. Pure. Evil. 




 AND it spreads awareness. Him doing it on his own doesn't help to even improve the general PR and enthusiasm towards the campaign 




  That's pretty much the exact conclusion I came to. There's a system in place (no matter how imperfect) to affect change in our society. He flagrantly disregarded it (and made a rather handsome profit at the same time).

Sooooooo how do you feel about Snowden and/or Manning?
 




 LIFE. 

Remember that.

LIFE 




 Better than dying of starvation?  




 his first wife was his high school teacher I believe 









 What does transparency have to do with this? 




 She's a successful comedian...its kinda accepted theres no young ones outside of a handful  




 Never forget it 




 because like 4-5 countries have claims there 




 Never
 




 MY GOD! 




 I see what you did there 




 Redman still being scolded at 40 years old.

Its so hard to like this guy.  









 even if its a private organization? 




 What was actually illegal here? Was it tax evasion? 









 not anymore 




 Hussein is corrupt too 














 Its kinda hard to have an organization like international soccer and it NOT be corrupt.

some of the places where business is done, corruption is de rigueur
