 Hey, thanks for the answer! I guess with hindsight I should have added that I know what you are saying, and I am proud that people like you exist. My post could be used as a good proxy to see how many investors here are ACTUALLY investors like Graham explained in II.

My analysis reports that I do for the companies I research are around/above 2000 words, and the formula is just a footnote in my analysis. My analysis is completely based on the analysis put forward in II, and I would want to reassure you I do not depend on this formula; usually, by the time I reach it, I already have a constructive opinion of the value of the company anyways. 

However, I would be very interested indeed on building this formula properly, and would love it if you could help me.

Thanks again for the answer and link though, maybe even more helpful than what I expected. Have a good day! :) 




 Hey r/investing!
This is a simple question from a simple person. In the formula (for those unaware:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham_formula), one of the key elements is the "growth rate". 
My question is, what exactly is this growth rate of? Revenue? Earnings? Something else?

My second question links to the first one. Where does one find / How does one predict the growth rate in the next 7 to 10 years?

Thank you very much for the help!  




 From my recent trip to Hong Kong. 









 If I did mistakes, please tell me so :p 




 For those that are not aware of the video game Civilization 5: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V

Order is similar to communism
Freedom is similar to democracy
Autocratic is similar dictatorship/Fascism 









 I completely agree. I just seem to think the same thing in half the posts and here you are writing it. If it makes you fell any better, people did this in the 1920s too, only the technology got faster. That's why I humbly believe personal finances ought to be a subject taught in high schools with proper exams. But maybe I'm wrong. 




 I wonder what you think when you write this. 




 What do YOU, ladies and gentlemen, think about GE right now? 




 Thank you 3

 Thanks. I did do some mistakes however :( 




 I agree with you. I think the word "empire" is very broad, just like "country". Is a colonial empire, like the British, the same as a 'grand' empire like the Roman, Persian, Ottoman or Mughal empires? Certainly not. But I also believe there is a third type of empire, lets call them 'tsunami empires' (because 1) sounds cool and 2) I think its a good analogy). 

In my humble opinion, I believe the 'tsunami empires' ought to also be considered equals like the ones above. Napoleon, Alexander and Genghis Khan all created real empires that invaded enormous territories, with legacies resonating throughout history. 

I agree with your post, the French empire was extremely different from the Roman Empire (and others), but I believe it still was one, the same way Russia and the Vatican are both countries, even though arguably with slight differences.

Do all of these empires even hold one common similarity? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#All_empires_at_their_greatest_extent

PS. Napoleon did win wars. Out of the 7 coalitions, France won the first 5. Each of them was a separate war, with interluding times of peace, and each of them not started by France. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-19

He also did hold on to the conquests. The empire itself was governed in a very efficient way, and unlike Ottoman Empire, where its regions broke away from it, Napoleons empire fell apart due to foreign invasion. Example: After the first coalition, France established puppet states "sister republics". In the second coalition (war), the allies attempted to take away France's conquests; conquests Napoleon successfully held - winning the war of the second coalition.

Hope I managed to counter-argue in an efficient and unbiased manner. However, being french, I might be biased :P 




 Thanks. First post 3 




 Drew this while playing ETW (turns are long)

First map: Pre-Napoleonic Europe
Second map: The rise of the French empire till its zenith in 1812. Each colour corresponds for the coalition wars.
Third map: Europe at the France's zenith. 

Feel free to comment, criticize and complain, I would want to know any feedback.

PS. Imagine how easy it would be to "name every country in europe" in 1812 :p 









 Over powered. Invade Mughal too easily. No real enemies after that. 




 I believe u/Elos's response has been very well written as well as thought through. The blame of the war is on all nations, and arguing for the blame of a specific country can be easily done as all of them were guilty of many things, which I assume you know.

However, as Elos and (I assume) everyone else agrees, the guilt is not spread evenly. When analysing the start of the war, the "gunpowder" and the "spark" are two different multitudes of factors, and analysing only one or the other is a disservice to the actual events.

The "spark" can be clearly blamed on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which Elos elaborately explained. But the blame is also on Russia, with its incompetent Tsar and government. Germany too is to blame for supporting A-H's aggressive foreign policy. But the narrative 'assassination = war' is simply put: wrong, as Elos again explained. To add to that, it took over a month between the assassination and the start of the war. The Archduke was a moderate, and was deeply unpopular in the A-H elite. It was, again as Elos said, the ultimatum that commenced the war.

The blame for the "powder" can be blamed on even more nations, throughout history 
(I mean, one can blame the Louis XIV for being a douche, which resulted in the kings being douches, which resulted in the French revolution, which resulted in Europe attacking France which resulted in Napoleon invading Europe, which resulted in the unity of Germany, which resulted in Austria being weak, which resulted in them becoming allies, which resuted in WW1, which resulted in WW2, which resulted in the Cold War, which resulted in the space race, which...)
but generally speaking, Germany has contributed to the most "powder". Not as much as the treaty of Versailles imposed, but did contribute the most. 




 An example. The IS attempted mass conversion, and according to some, genocide of the Yezidi people (the brown area between Iraq and Syria). Presently, the vast majority of the Yezidi have fled to nearby Turkey, Kurds, or other areas of Iraq/Syria. This may be interesting to you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinjar_massacre.

This is just an example, and as u/Tollaneer and others would explain, the IS is attempting 'religious cleansing'. 




 The US had a larger population. But the size of the economy is not all. There's a time lag for economic power to translate into cultural, political, military, technological power.

Assume China's economy becomes larger than that of the US (it is in PPP). It will take decades for the US to lose its military, political, etc. dominant position.

Even though the US was larger, technological innovations still happened in the EU3. Germany had still the largest army, France arguably best medicine, UK most political clout, etc.

Hope this helped. 




 For those who don't know, Paris, Lyon, French Guyana and Martinique didn't participate because they merged the department and region, and therefore will participate only in the region.

Marseilles, even though larger than Lyon, is not when only Marseilles proper is considered, which is why it is not with Paris and Lyon in the "big league of cities". Greater Marseilles is spread out across departmental borders.

 Wtf happened to botswana 




 Every time it passed. Because I repeal it every time. :) 




 Hey r/civ!

Im sure this question could be interesting for many of you. By best I mean most historically accurate, large, fun to play with. Thanks in advance!
