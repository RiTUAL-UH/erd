 I have that cup....and the entire set!!

Cute hedgehog, too! :-) 




 Seeing how it's KU's colors. Yours fits rather well.  




 Never knew this form of art existed. It's amazing and beautiful!  




 I was so excited when I bought my new phone and failed to read through the details. From now on, I won't be talked in to purchasing it. I might actually point out how much of a scam it is to the store employee. 

Mailed my phone to Cell Phone Repair (CPR) store. Hopefully the estimate won't be too much. It of course broke AFTER I got back from the city that has the store. Unfortunately, I do not want to make that 1.5 hr drive again. A sh*t load of construction + college students = a bad time. 

It's a Google Nexus 5. :-) 




 The answer is yes, but more so no. 

Via a close-friend who is a former Orthodox Jew. 

Shmuley Boteach is such a schmuck. He just wants to sell Orthodox Judaism in a way that looks hip and cool and to make Orthodox Judaism seem less like...Orthodox Judaism. What he doesn't say is that you have to ritually wash your hands before and after sex, the man has to recite certain psalms before entering the woman, and that it is *best* to be covered with a sheet or blanket, which means that you kind of have to do it in missionary otherwise a sheet will slip off, and why would you do it a different way if you could do it the *better* way? The man also has to wear his kippah during sex. Now, Shmuley isn't Chassidic, but we were Lubavitch, which means the woman has to keep her hair covered during sex. Oh, and sure, the "niddah" period during the period and for an additional week leads to lust, but don't you sometimes want to hug each other? You can't share the same bed during that time? The woman can't even SIT on the man's bed during that time so as to not arouse him. You cannot pass things directly to each other and you have to put something on the table when you sit together to serve as a reminder that you cannot touch or pass things to each other. You cannot even pass a baby to each other. Sure, *sets it next to my hand on counter*, then I pick it up.

Edit: forgot a few words.

 There comes a point when smoking too much can revert your problems with PTSD. I had that happen and had to stop smoking. 




 Husband yelling at wife for never doing anything right. Wife gets up, crying, and leaves. Husband and daughter remain at table. Husband then decides to call and yell at his wife. 

I sat there trying not to notice, but they were seated directly across from our table and in my line of view. My Dad asked why I didn't speak up and say something, I was the only one at the table who heard the commotion; I didn't want to piss off the Husband and receive an unnecessary bitching. Felt so sorry for their daughter. Unfortunately she might be used to it.

This was at a fancy restaurant in Plano, TX.

 




 That's what I worry about happening.  




 I agree. But furthering an understanding and appreciation in art, at a young age, wouldn't be a bad thing.  




 TL;DR - too much THC with no experience is likely to make you sick. 

Does not necessarily mean the brownies/cookies were laced with other drugs.  




 She makes an excellent point, aside from the modern critique.

 Through 23andMe I started to question whether the individual I came to know as my Dad was in fact my biological father. Turns out I was right. I never brought it up to my parents because we were going through enough stress at the time. 

Mid-August, my Mom finally came clean with the information. She was legally responsible in telling us (as stated in court documents) and withheld this information from us for over a decade. The documents permitted her to release the information once we (myself and my siblings - two older brothers) reached 18 years of age. I am the youngest and now 27. I laughed when my Mom brought out the legal papers. She asked why and I told her I had figured it out months ago. She was upset I never mentioned it to her, and I wish I hadn't waited. 

I know who he is, know where he lives. I even know and have is phone number. I've called at least once a day for the past few weeks, but no one answers and the call goes straight to voice mail. I wonder if they have caller ID and decide not to answer (so I often call with an unknown number) or his wife deletes my number (which is screwed up seeing how she's a licensed psychologist - yes, I've done my research). Either way, I have had no luck.

One thing I really find unnerving is ~~that~~ the fact I always wish I had a sister. Turns out I have two older half-sisters and one half-brother. I had a third older half-sister but she passed away in 1983. My middle name was in honor of her. 

Would it be wrong for ~~my~~ me to leave a message on their answering machine or messaging him over Facebook? I want to meet him. Based on what my Mom has shared, we have a lot in common; and what I have discovered through my own research.  As a kid, I always brought up ideas and concepts that my Mom thought were stupid and I finally understand why - it's something he would have thought or been in favor of doing. 

I saw him once, but didn't know who he was. I was 18 years-old and out to eat at Panera with my Mom. After bringing the food back to the table I told her that a table of older men kept staring at me. I do not recall her reply, but once they left the restaurant, she informed me it was him.  




 10-15 minutes and small lawn vs. paying someone $50/week to mow. 




 I've had this happen several times. You stand no chance of finding it because they wash off during a car wash and fall down through the drain. Do what /u/SCUDSMcKenzie suggests and buy a new one.  




 I disagree. Went to this location twice and felt even worse after leaving. That's when I decided to pay the price and see Gina.

Give this place a try since it's cheap, but know there are better options in Lawrence.  




 I highly suggest Gina! Went to her for over a year to treat vertigo problems. Unlike Ad Astra, she's certified through the state. Last I heard, Ad Astra was not. 
 
For pricing, she might accept your insurance or provide some sort of payment options. You'll have to discuss that with her. 

 




 Their company runs ~~though~~ through Etsy (sorry Etsy) and has thousands of good reviews. They must be lies I tell you....LIES!!!!!!  




 Fortunately, on behalf of the company, I have chosen to omit their name. 

edit: punctuation  




 She must not have wanted to admit to poor service by her company, so she decided the 'God + Babies = Whatever point she had in mind.'  




 Touch mi amigo. 




 Her comment undermines the whole point of "God". 




 No worries about taking it personally. I found it so unprofessional that I decided it was worth sharing.

It's surprising (and sad) to see that the email isn't written in a professional manner; never mind the religious-based information. 

Edit: I added a semicolon.  




 Unfortunately she's one of the people in charge of the company.

edit: word 




 Here was my review for the product:

Ordered this product OVER A MONTH AGO and have yet to receive it. Have also contacted the company TWICE and no one has replied.

 They must be been on their way to something else....Not sure what if it wasn't the chase. As the OP stated, the fire was already taken care of.

With all the new inexperienced drivers in town, I was expecting a crash. Too many darn one-way roads.... 




 Wondered what all that noise was about. I live near 6th street and heard a lot of law enforcement drive by.  









 Our cat does all of those. It means she wants treats. Luckily for her she's adorable and we always fall for it.
 




 I always have the two during my morning routine of breakfast and Star Trek. :-) 




 I drink this most mornings and often without feeling tired before hand. As soon as I finish drinking it, I feel like I could sleep a few hours. This even happens after drinking English Morning Tea. I stopped drinking the tea for a while because it started making me sick, even with a full stomach. 

Perhaps I have a different reaction to caffeine. Either way, it is quite annoying.

edit: Removed a word. 




 Thanks for the tip. We actually use all three, depending on which we choose to buy when we restock after running out. I'll definitely choose one of the two next time! 









 My parents hid the fact we were all adopted by our Dad because our biological father wasn't married to our Mom and we would have been a burden to his family (wealthy and prominent in the community). He paid our child support but I never knew of him - in being more than just a past relationship with our Mom.

I found this out last Sunday. I'm 27, have two older siblings, and am now aware that I have four half-siblings.  














 Luckily it's located right up beside the house. So a lawn mower didn't find it, but our dogs sure did. For now we're trying to make sure they leave the bunnies alone. Unfortunately there are a lot of hunting dogs in the neighborhood.  














 Really? Visited KState and KU for a journalism conference back in high school. I always liked KU after my first trip to Lawrence. 




 We'll make it seem like we're not killing you ever-so-slowly by giving you this amazing view as you eat. Enjoy suckers!!!! 




 Please tell me they left honeycomb in at least one jar.

 Book: 'The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread'


I bake French Bread instead of buying sandwich bread and I've baked English Muffins, too. Still trying to decide on what to make next, but I'll definitely enjoy it no matter what it is! :-)

 Thank you and they taste great!  









 Forgot to include Burrito King. Great deals, delicious food, and open until 3am.  









 Half moon 




 Taking a picture wasn't easy because the moon would move out of view within a few minutes. Plus lining the camera up with the viewfinder made it even more difficult. 




 Equipment:

SkyQuest 8" scope and 25mm  Orion Sirius plossl

 Sorry for the wait , but I'll ask when I see him later this afternoon! 




 Yes it is!!! It's a half moon! Can't wait to take a picture of a full moon.

 Have you cut open a tube afterwards to see if there's anything left? I get the feeling that some makeup might be stuck to the sides of the tube. 

Either way, that's a great idea. Thanks for sharing!  




 Did you even read the story? His wife did everything possible to not get him deported; but even that didn't work. Now he's banned from entering the US, returning to the life he had lived for 20 years, for 10 years. Sorry, but that's f*cked up. There are more than enough illegal immigrants who could be deported, not someone who has made a life for himself and someone else.  




 Should have posted this yesterday but anyway here's the container. 

http://www.imgur.com/dl8yQXV.jpeg

 




 Welcome! :-) 




 Great opportunity to make a ring! That is if you know how to weld... 




 Unfortunately that wouldn't work. The container isn't the type where you can do that. For now, it's stored in a zip loc bag and should last me close to a month.  




 Or for people who suffer from amnesia. 

Not sure which types would benefit the most by using a cell phone, but it's the thought that counts.

edit: typos and such 




 Might try using a sharp pair of scissors and cut off the end. Or a steak knife. They'll cut through just about anything as long as they're sharp.
 




 Haha, I posted the picture on /r/pics (they weren't friendly so I deleted the post) and someone thought the same thing!  




 I've never tried that, but I wouldn't be surprised. Also, cutting the container(s) open might not be as easy.  




 I deleted the post but I have it stored in a zip-loc bag. Hopefully that will work. :-/ 




 That's a great idea!!! I'll see if I can find any later this week!  




 The container looks flat due to how I held it so I could show what was left. Luckily the sides fold in and it will keep that from happening.  




 Plan to store it in a zip-loc bag. Hopefully that will keep it from drying out.  









 Not to mention it's flat and boring (except in the NE).

Plan to move to Southern California, with my boyfriend, within the next year and say sayonara to Kansas. 




 The Koch brothers will definitely keep it all to themselves.  









 Everyone should definitely buy The Forest. Killing cannibals has never been so much fun.  




 Thank you! I've missed fishing. My step-dad sold my fishing gear once I moved out and off to college. Spending that day at the lake (more so reservoir) with my boyfriend and his dad was so much fun! We've decided to turn it into a weekly adventure (have 7-8 locations to choose from).

Bama as in Alabama? Sounds more exciting that KS...haha.
 









 That I cannot answer. Today was the second time I've gone fishing in over a decade. Someone else might be able to answer your question. :-) 




 In KS (at least where we live) you're allowed 5/ day. 

Also caught a Catfish and a Perch. My boyfriend caught a Drum fish; never heard of that one before today. 














 Disney Stores.....

If not, they're located in most malls.

They sell clothes, toys, music, movies and other Disney trinkets.

The one I went to has a small theater area playing nothing but Frozen. 

 




 You're kidding, right?  




 Stay out of Disney Stores. They have that video and song playing nonstop. 




 Remember when you had to have a college email address to sign up for Facebook? Those were the days. 




 I'll admit their outfits are nice and all, but I love the dress of the lady at the 3rd link in your list. Even after looking through all the competing dresses, it still remained my top choice.
