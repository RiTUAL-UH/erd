 I want to build up leg strength so I feel the stress of running less on the knee joints. 









 yea we all did, it's on the internet 




 Wealth worship 




 Yea for real 




 Kill Bill, any scene. 

Constantine, when a perfect circle song plays in that club.

 




 That weird sphere of water was amazing. 




 The Stranger by Albert Camus 




 Mysteries of Pittsburgh by Michael Chabon. Made him famous. 




 Thank you, Wolf Hall sounds like what I want. 




 Any books told through the eyes of a right hand man? It could be about crime, kingdoms, politics, anything.  




 People aren't as interested in dinosaurs anymore. I'm with you on that. JW wont pass $300 million in America. $800 worldwide total. 




 Nah. T shirt selling is the laziest form of entrepreneurship.
American Apparel is the one making money here 




 Not unless you live in a Nielsen home!

Unknown to many, but ratings are actually based on sample sizes, basically a small amount of Americans supposedly representing the larger population have boxes in their home that document viewing habits. If you don't have this box, or report by telephone, nothing you watch at home counts. 




 Booooooo 




 I'm watching Armageddon right now and its just really long montage so far. First came the "Destruction montage" then the "exposition montage" the "recruiting montage" and now the "training montage".


I'm going to turn my tv off  




 I would 




 AC was a job I was hoping to get. Air traffic in the civilian world is something that is never going to stop, so jobs always available. 




 Superbowl half time show when Katy sang 'Fireworks' everybody I was with just started quoting 'The Interview' it was kinda annoying 




 Definitely. Song only exist because of that movie basically 




 Neverwhwre by Neil Gaiman. Best book he has written. London underground, fantasy elements. 




 It doesn't. Back in 1999 did you have Netflix? Or any on demand service? The industry is different now. 




 Fuck inflation in regards to box office. All effect it has is negated by the fact that there were less movies and less ways to watch movies back in the day. Saying that Gone With The Wind would have grossed $1 billion in today's dollars is wrong because it only broke records back in the day cause it played for years and it was one of very few movies available to watch. 




 I'm watching Horns right now, the Joe Hill novel adaption, and the Pixies "Where is my mind" just came on. It completely took me out of the movie because of how well it ended Fight Club.


What songs should never be used again? 




 Honestly I finished it today and would like some of my time back. The first 400 pages were great but the last third was a chore. 




 I love immersing myself into the mad men world at least once a year. Seen every season at least three times. Show gets better everytime.  




 Go for it dude. I realized three years after graduating high school that I wanted to do it, so I did. Now I'm just waiting to ship out. I wish i would have straight after high school though. 




 Yup. Escapism is beautiful because it doesn't matter who you are when you read something, you can be a rich man or a poor man but the book is the book. All it needs is to be read. 




 If anything why not just go for a non clearance requiring job?  




 Wouldnt the college loan be the largest issue? 




 That's so fucking cool that I expect Hollywood to copy this video in a movie soon. 




 What type of job would you like, and what type of base would you like? 




 This one isn't by Justin Lin, its by James Wan the Saw director. 




 You know in the movies when the bad guy plays games with the good guy? (Die Hard With a Vengeance, Skyfall, Dark Knight) any good books like this? 




 I've looked into that and what I've read shows that the program is mostly for nukes, I'm not going in as nuke. 




 I'm going to be starting up my active duty enlisted contract in three months. I have an associates degree currently and was wondering if after I serve my four years I can use my G.I Bill to do two more years of college, get my Bachelors, and then apply for OCS?


I'm going Navy enlisted, but I'd go officer in any branch. I'm 22 years old, so i'd be 26 at seperation, and 28 at bachelors graduation.

 The books doubled in page count after PoA.  




 They change the title in other regions? 




 And Harry Potter of course. Fantastic series. 




 Shit, can you even stomach the plane ride to Great Lakes? 




 Daddy I want a pony!! 




 Both of those are my favorites. 




 Can you explain this concept to me as if I was a five year old? 




 Shit, come to think of it, never have read a Compton book. 




 Currently taking a meteorology class and I realize that its a very interestingnsubject . Any fiction out there that deals with weather? Maybe hard conditions, or the stir of meteorologists? Thank you. 




 I dont know and i dont care. The Sun also Rises was the best book I read last year. Farewell to arms was tragically great as well 




 Because he saved soldiers from his side 




 I second your suggestion.
Might still be on sale at bn.com for $2.99 




 Nope, R rated Cody Banks looking film with an unknown actor as the protag.  Definite bomb. Dredd numbers for sure. 




 A prophet 









 Part of the reason? Its most of the reason. Most effective ad campaign I've ever seen. The trailer itself felt like a short film. 




 That's weird

I graduated at 18 and in summer months and they never said anything about it. 




 So when it bombs they're gonna blame the rating instead of the everything else. 




 I hate fantasy epics or "true" epics, like LOTR, Mummy films, Seventh Son, Troy, Hercules, Kingdom of Heaven.


When most of the people that die are random soldiers its hard to care. 




 "well if you insist Fox" 




 No one ever told me about how intensely absurd the minds inner monologue is during psychedelics.


I felt as if my thoughts weren't my own, and its really hard to describe past that. 




 Fuck YES!

I love when entertainment makes me feel. 









 It wouldn't be a reality show, it would be a scripted workplace comedy, like The Office or Parks and Rec. 




 I'd be willing to receive one of those copies
