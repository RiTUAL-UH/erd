 Your reply was pointless.... 




 Is it that strange to want to talk about a future? Plenty of people so nowadays... 




 OH is other half...but thanks anyway  




 Make myself less depressed, and a lot more happy.  




 Yes, I like to know everything before I get myself into a deep, serious relationship. I'm not too bothered about announcing it to people, but I'd like myself and my partner to know where we are heading and if it is the right direction.  




 We've been together for longer than 3 months :) I understand how that may be annoying! 




 Other half...sorry will make it clearer
