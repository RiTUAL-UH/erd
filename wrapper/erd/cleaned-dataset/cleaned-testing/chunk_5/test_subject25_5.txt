 I really like the new youtube streaming channel but will games still be saved on twitch?
I would like to see things like Eurotruck where there is copyrighted music saved to both Youtube and Twitch.On Twitch copyrighted music is much more lenient and then  people on mobile can still watch non music edition on Youtube .
