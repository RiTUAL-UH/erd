 Chemistry. I love chemistry to no end and our teacher's a lot of fun. Or band, I like band too because it's band.

End alphabetism now 




 Holy cow I love this picture. When I first glanced at the title, I thought it said "Detroit smuggles harder" and I rolled my eyes but then clicked on the picture and reread the title and I have one of my new favorite posts, I love this a lot 




 THIS IS THE FIRST THING ON THIS SUB TO MAKE ME VERBALLY SAY "AWW" IN A LONG TIME OH MY GOD I CAN'T HANDLE THIS 




 I LOVE this kind of pixel art. I wish more game developers that tried to do pixel art didn't do a horrible job at it. 




 Orange juice, I'd rather not feel like I'm drinking piss with a bunch of sugar in it 




 It's like, the love/hate relationship you have with your best friend. You jokingly tell them they're horrible and you hate them but you actually love them a lot. 




 Because we hate the same things and we can act like lesbians together. Also she's gross and horrible and I hate her but she's my best friend and I love her so much 




 "Sorry I love my family" oh my god 




 I was actually discussing with my friend whether or not that happened yet. I guess my question is answered. Oh jeez. 




 Not only do I hate the taste, I hate the feeling of being intoxicated. I was with 2 friends last summer and we decided to get drunk (it was my first time drinking, not theirs) and I HATED being drunk. I could just feel things spill out of my mouth and I cried and lost control of myself and it's one of the worst things I've ever felt. So, yeah. Never again. 




 July 3rd. Overshadowed by fireworks and hot dogs every year. Sigh. 




 Landlocked Blues - Bright Eyes 




 It's been ENDLESS Brand New and Bright Eyes and Bob Dylan lately. 




 "Goodnight. You have scary friends, for the record" 




 Mm, just stay up all day then you'll be able to sleep at like, 8 :D 




 Poison Oak by Bright Eyes. The entire song. Every single chord and lyric in that song can make me weep. Easily one of my top 5 favorites of all time. 




 My state championship robotics competition next weekend :) also I'm on spring break now so no school next week and sleeping until 2 pm 




 I'm sure it's pretty common. I've definitely done it a couple times. I know it's kind of a not super great thing to do, but we want you to realize you did something that upset us and we don't want to have to spell it out for you. It's kind of childish and unnecessary but I think most girls do it.  




 Oh yeah, I'm definitely working on it. A few weeks ago I was talking to my ex who I'm still on kinda good terms with, we were sort of talking about getting back together for a while. Then he was obviously upset at something and it was coming off as him being mad at me and I was trying so hard to pry it out of him and it ended up in a HUGE argument. So learned my lesson a bit there. 




 Yeah, honestly I need to get better at that. I ask people not to do that to me, but in a relationship if I can tell something is wrong it is so hard for me not to pry. I get worried it's about me, and I just don't like seeing my SO upset. So I will bug them and bug them and it actually drives a wedge in between friendships and stuff. I don't do it in a malicious or mean way, I'm just genuinely concerned and don't want my SO to be upset, but I just come on a little bit strong. 




 That's actually kind of condescending and would probably just make me more upset if I didn't want to talk. 




 The Promise - Reel Big Fish. One of my favorite covers of anything ever. It's right up with Iron and Wine's cover of Such Great Heights. 




 The beginning of that actually sounds so condescending tbb 




 I think I found one of my new favorite pictures. 




 Best of You - Foo Fighters 




 I know it's not something people can just "get over" because it's an actual personality trait. But I am really introverted and I feel like it holds me back a lot. Like, I'm in robotics and marching band and sometimes I feel so alone and like I'm an outcast, then I realize it's my own fault. I'm terrified to talk to people, and when I do it's incredibly awkward. I have friends that I can be myself around, but lately I've been pushing them all away. I never feel like hanging out or texting them. I just want to sit in my room alone and listen to music or read all the time, and I know that's not how I should be spending my time. I should be out having fun with my friends, but I just don't feel like it. I know I'll never be perfect at socializing and having friends, but I really need ways to stop the antisocial and extremely introverted tendencies I have. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so done with being alone all the time because I don't know how to socialize. 




 I'm a girl and about 5'5" and it's a pretty good height I think 




 annamarie225

I'm from michigan and i like dogs and self loathing and sleeping and robots and music.  









 Mostly B's. I lose so much motivation this time of year, and I usually hold myself to a really high standard and am usually a straight-A student. So I'm pretty down about that. 




 Oh I can't dance at ALL, but it was kind of fun when I was tripping over his feet and we laughed. Idk, that was one of my favorite parts tbh. P.S. It's okay I broke up with him 




 Brand New, Bon Iver, The Tallest Man on Earth, Neutral Milk Hotel, Bright Eyes, Bob Dylan, Panic at the Disco, Shigeto, Jason Mraz, and Paramore. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting, but that's a lot of them. 




 It depends on what she's into, but my (now ex) boyfriend wanted to take me to homecoming really badly this year but I was really opposed to it, as I hate big dances and large gatherings of hormone-filled teenagers in the same room. So we just agreed that we would go out for a nice dinner then go back to his house. He knew I always liked just cuddling on the couch watching a movie better than going out somewhere. Then when he drove me home from dinner he went in the house first and told me to wait a second and that he would text me when I could come in, because he had a surprise. Then when I came in there was this song playing that we always listened to together and he was wearing a nice suit and he just grabbed me and started dancing with me. It was super nice and made me feel like I wasn't missing out. If your girlfriend is into cheesy romantic stuff like that then she might like being surprised with her own little "mini-prom" from you. Really though, it takes the right kind of person to enjoy it. 




 I know this is said all the time, but I hate how when women sleep with lots of people, she's a slut. But when men sleep with lots of people, he's considered cool and his male peers think more highly of them a lot of the time. 




 Miley Cyrus, not gonna lie. 




 Ohh yeah, it was pretty bad. Me and a few other people on the team said it was because the wrong team was losing. But ah well, we ended up winning anyway, even though that was a pretty infuriating rematch, lol. By the way, we love 573 :3 3 




 That happened to us at Southfield! It's the worst feeling. 




 I can't even imagine that frustration, omg. 




 Did you end up replaying the match? 




 I wish I had a video of the lights coming loose. At the end of the day, the red alliance ended up winning, but at this point in finals we had one loss against a powerhouse alliance, and were pretty excited to have almost won, and I think the fact that we replayed it when there were 6 seconds left was a little bit unnecessary.  




 At the Waterford competition, during the second final match, [part of the LED strip came off of the high goal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danielernst/13521802593/in/set-72157643084658745/) when the red alliance was ahead by a good 40 points, with **6 seconds** left on the clock. Understandably, they had to restart the match. Needless to say, we were all pretty mad. Has this happened anywhere else? 




 That actually looks a LOT like my ex boyfriend and I think it might be him... 




 I'm more of an algebra kinda gal 




 Sitting in geometry. Just took a test. Woo. 




 Jk I'm done being a freak now. What's up? 




 i am me. or am i you? who knows. maybe you aren't supposed to know. shhh. 




 ay what is u 




 That pretty much just made my day. 




 I didn't, I didn't watch the Grammys  




 Not gonna lie, I used to be on the bandwagon that she sucked, but I love her now to no end. 




 Really? That's one of my favorites on the album 




 annamarie225, 15/f

Books, marching band, movies, robotics, science, music 




 Oh he was terrified. It was fantastic. 




 And this all happened when he was in 8th grade and I was in 9th grade so he was telling all his friends that he was about to date a high schooler and thought he was hot shit oh my God. 




 My favorite is when my friend and I were sending each other creepy lyrics and I meant to send him "I SEE GOD IN BIRDS AND SATAN IN LONG WORDS" but I accidentally sent it to someone else with no context. 




 The one time they come to my state, it's $300. 




 This guy was also talking to me one time and he's like "I have a... you know what" and I legitimately didn't know, so he's like "Hold on" and printed out "BONER" on a sticker from his label maker. 




 There's this kid on my robotics team got the nickname Harry Pooter last year. That's not a typo. I don't know how he got it, but I don't like him so it doesn't matter. 




 I am. Trombone in jazz and euph in concert and marching :3 




 Well personally I'm against it. I had an ex who ended up in a coma and kept waking up for a few minutes at a time (it was bizarre, he was dead about 5 times). And every time he woke up, he said he wanted to die. He woke up for good, and he has some issues now but he's almost back to normal. When he was telling me about it, he said that if assisted suicide was an option, he would have jumped on it in a second just because he was in pain and was upset just at the time. He still has depression and isn't in the best state, but he isn't suicidal anymore. He said he's so glad that he didn't end up dying. Miracles like that happen. 




 Oh God is Funnyjunk still a thing? I thought it was a lot of fun when I was like 13 omfg 




 I was on Skype with this kid that liked me, and he was showing me this label maker he got and I'm like "Oh cool" and acted like I cared because he was really excited over this label maker. Then he called me back on Skype the next day and fucking everything in his room is covered in stickers of my name. Like, he must have printed out at least 250 stickers of my name. 




 Wounded Healer by Watsky 




 Try Watsky. My favorite from him is Wounded Healer. Too lazy to get a link 




 Well I was going to major in chemistry and minor in some kind of business or management. But chemistry is what I'm passionate about and my first business choice research or teaching. It's not like it's the only thing I'd learn. But I know what you mean, chemical engineering probably would be a better option. It's something I'll have to consider. 




 I'm currently a sophomore in high school, but if I play my cards right, I'll be able to graduate as a junior. I realized how much I needed to begin looking at colleges. I want to be a chemist for sure, so my mom told me that MTU is a good school for students studying the sciences, but I had it in my head that it was based mainly on engineering. MTU has been one of my top choices since I started researching colleges more, but my question is how much they focus on the sciences, mainly chemistry. Thank you! 




 Thank, I sure hope so! Lol 




 I'm a sophomore and just got my first college email. It was from Marquette university. It finally hot me I need to start actually thinking abut my future ;-;
