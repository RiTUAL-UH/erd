 Thanks for the downvotes.  




 Maybe, or maybe it was the frank and to the point response of someone with a clouded and biased perspective. Did you read the link?  




 People are charged and convicted for everything and anything, left and right. We currently have more people incarcerated in the US than any other country in human history. 

You're obviously biased. This type of reluctance to prosecute is universal in cases involving the police. In states that require a grand jury indictment, the prosecutor purposefully includes evidence that casts doubt on the guilt of the offending police. A prosecutor would never, ever, in a million years, do this in a grand jury hearing involving a nonLEO. Prosecutors rely heavily on police departments to bring charges against offenders. They're part of the same team. They're not going to hold the police accountable anymore than they'd hold themselves accountable. They already have judges, prosecutors, grand juries, and the entire system on their side with everything they do, no matter how depraved. They don't need you on this sub sucking them off.

I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. These men recklessly killed an innocent child. If we're to have any faith in our criminal justice system or the rule of law in this county, it's imperative that they are tried and convicted.  




 Eternal life after death is not the same as someone coming back to life after dying.

Tell that to the hundreds of millions of true believers. 

It's really not my fault that you couldn't tell a clear joke.

I explicitly asked you if you were joking. It's your fault that you assured me that you were "Not at all.". 

 




 I'm not saying any of this. 

Atheism is not an organized belief system by any definition. If you're a Christian, you're still an atheist in the fact that you do not believe in Thor, Kali, or any one of the other millions of gods that mankind has imagined throughout history. 

There is undeniably a Christian majority in the US, and I just described how they vote. Don't like it? Fine, but that doesn't make it less true.  




 There are those who honestly believe that they will granted eternal life upon their death. Don't test the levels of ridiculousness that others can reach when it comes to their belief systems. 

And again, I straight up asked you before pursuing my point. You had the opportunity to make it clear that you were joking. I can't think of any better context than that.  




 Did you remove the offending link? Maybe put in an edit explaining as much? I'm not going anywhere near those links without some type of assurance.  




 Really? So when they vote for candidates who demonize the poor, minorities, and immigrants they're considering the scripture? When they vote against healthcare reform they're considering the scripture?  




 That all depends on what one considers a state's right to be.  




 [It's Supply Side Jesus!] (https://youtu.be/Gc-LJ_3VbUA)  




 So you're arguing that what is perceived to be a failure or incompetence within the system should restore faith in said system? And what exactly do you mean by failing to execute people? My state executes inmates quite regularly.  




 Then you should have said as much when I asked you if you were being sarcastic. [Sarcasm does not translate well when conversing with strangers over the internet.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)  




 How about plain old fucking innocent?

[Cameron Todd Willingham (January 9, 1968  February 17, 2004) was an American man who was convicted of murdering his three young children by arson at the family home in Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham#Post-execution_attention)  




 But, yet murder rates are unaffected. Is it possible that yours is a bullshit and/or meaningless statistic?  




 Am I joking? 

What's semi-permanent about death? 

For instance, hair dye is labeled "semi-permanent" because you can cut the dyed hair and eventually your hair will grow out as your natural color. 

Have I missed something about executions? Is there some process by which the state can restore life when it finds that it's made a "mistake".  




 Yeah, at least I'd know and at least I'd be comfortable in the fact that my animals and therefore food was treated humanely and allowed to live a healthy life.  




 You must have figured out some way of restoring life to the innocent people who have been and will continue to be unjustly executed.  




 It's not just private prisons. The whole justice system is biased as in relies on the proceeds from keeping people in  the system in order to cover payrolls and other costs.  




 Ah, the human tax that supports the justice system. The number or percentage of innocent folks that must be unjustly incarcerated or executed in order to have a "just society". The argument that causes brain cancer.  




 The difference is that people were writing about Khan and his doings during the period in which he was alive. In order for it to be an apt comparison, there would have to be no writing about him at all until after his death (which also wasn't recorded). 

I'm not interested in musings and whatnot. I'd like hard evidence like someone who wasn't illiterate having actually spoken to the man and recording his experience, or maybe some secondary sources like certification or tax records.  




 So you've discovered a way to restore life to a man or woman who has been unjustly executed?  




 So murderers can take lives, but they shouldn't have their lives taken away from them?

Maybe you should read the last line again. You seem confused. 

Nobody should have the right to legally murder someone, taking away one's greatest freedom - to live.

Murder is always wrong and the government shouldn't be murdering people. 

 




 Being put to death is semi-permanent,

Is this sarcasm?  




 I have a question. Where was god in SC, when nine of his followers were worshipping HIM in his own house?  




 Personally, I wouldn't be as worried about organic as much as I am about them being able to move around outside and being properly processed. If I had enough property outside of town i wouod already have a coop.  




 I'm going to catch that dog just so I can give it tap water.  




 Yeah but just because he was written about until after his death doesn't mean he didn't exist. 

You're not wrong, but that's still not evidence of his existence, which is what I was talking about. Personally I don't care if he existed or not being that I'm not a believer. I just don't cotton to "historical facts" which have no objective evidence supporting them. 

Pretty sure that same logic would need to be applied to genghis khan if we're being consistent.

Is this true? Did no one write about Genghis Khan while he was alive? I'm going to look that up. But undeniably there are countless cases of evidence of his existence including the DNA of his descendants. 

Edit: On second thought your claim about Genghis Khan is obviously bullshit. The man who began a campaign to conquer the world was written about extensively by enemies and allies. 


 




 Got it. I imagine it's possible that one might locate a local farmer as a source of feed at a more reasonable rate, but otherwise, I can see how it would be difficult to provide organic feed all of the time.  




 Like I said, dipshit, I'm thirty-four. You're not insulting me. You're just making mlre of an ass of your cop apologist self. Go somewhere that people can stand the presence of a kid killer's apologist. Like I said PnS is perfect for you.  




 Go to PnS. There are plenty of steroid shriveled police balls for you to suck on over there. They'll be happy to take your things from you and rape your loved ones, which apparently is what you want. So go fuck yourself.  




 This is who you have patrolling your communities armed to the teeth.  




 Sometimes ~~people~~ police do bad things that there simply are not criminal charges for.


FTFY. 
 




 Oh, okay so now you're suggesting that protocol when dealing with a **potential** gunman is to speed as close as possible and shoot without even really looking at the suspect first. I wasn't aware that the police were being trained to operate as death squads. 

I will not "chill it". I'm not fourteen, I'm thirty-four. This is a clear case of two officers, on video recklessly shooting a child, and letting him die in the grass and snow. If you want to defend these monsters go to PnS. You'll be greeted with open arms by the other murderers and robbers. I'm sure they'll even let you buy them a beer or wash their cruisers.  




 That's all very convenient for these officers, when we have teenagers serving life sentences for being involved in a burglary where one of their accomplices was shot by the homeowner. It seems to me that 85% to 95% of the time, the prosecutor gets the charges and the convictions they want. When the police kill a child in cold blood; "It's too difficult." 




 No first I said "fuck you" and described you as a "bootlicker" and as scum, then you called me an asshole to which I responded in kind. 

There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say. 

How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge. 
 




 You're a complete dipshit. The fact that you're even mentioning risk assessment here illustrates how biased you are. The police did not assess the risk involved in this situation. Risk assessment doesn't include positioning oneself as close as possible without first assessing the risk. 

You need to understand things dont work like they do in movies. 

Right. Tell that to these two gung-ho Dirty Harry wannabes. Don't tell me that. I'm the one arguing that police should follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone involved. 

You're a police apologist and you're here defending the indefensible. Will you be singing the same song when the police kill someone you love? You make me sick.  




 I think the evidence speaks for itself. The police abandoned protocol, recklessly sped as close to the suspect as physically possible, and proceeded to shot him multiple times. They then failed to render aid and treated his child sister like a violent criminal. There are plenty of charges that would be appropriate as well as the charge of murder. They're scum for what they did. You're* scum for defending them.  




 There are* other laws that could apply here. Criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, accomplice to murder before and after the fact. If the DA figures out a way to avoid charging them, it's not going to be because of a lack of things to charge them with.  




 Ohio is an open carry state. So it wouldn't necessarily have been illegal even if the gun was real. The police could have pulled up to the curb and used their PA to order the boy to drop the weapon and get on the gound. Instead they flew in as close as possible to surprise him and began shooting him before the car even came to a complete stop. They then refused to render aid to him as he lay gasping on the ground. They manhandled and handcuffed his younger sister and threw her in a police cruiser. 

Everything about this case is fucked. Both of the officers involved should be stripped naked and publicly flogged before being thrown in prison for the rest of their lives. They're scum for their murderous insolence. You're scum for defending them.  




 Well, in this case he wouldn't have been killed. The kid wasn't even holding the air pistol. They just murdered him because they wanted to kill a black guy. They have to be held accountable.  




 You're the asshole defending two ruthless murderers. As you may be able to tell from my comments here, I think your opinion is shit and could not care less about* what you think of me. Your lack of judgment on this very obvious brutal murder makes it clear that you have nothing useful to say.  




 Yes they're criminals. They murdered a twelve-year-old boy in cold blood. This isn't rocket science. Or do you feel safe with these jack booted thugs patrolling the neighborhood your kids play in?  




 Fuck that. They obviously didn't follow the rules to the point of recklessness and someone got killed. They deserve to be tried. If you can't get that through your thick scull then there are plenty of other subs that would love to hear your valueless opinion.  




 Fuck you. Those cops executed that kid. This is one of the most egregious examples of police brutality, but what do you know, along comes bootlicker here to defend the murderous thugs. We have every right as tax paying citizens to demand that the police follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone around.  




 Yes I have. Oddly, no one had to die.  




 Does that include cases where the officer knowingly puts himself in that situation? Ohio is an open carry state. There's no excuse for what they did here.  




 You charge them both for not following procedure, ignoring the law and the safety of the community, and murdering a twelve year old boy. 

Edit: I'd like to point out that 

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

So OP is at the very least, being disingenuous about there not being a legal basis for criminal charges in this case. This is one of the reasons why it favors the police to drag these things out as long as possible. People forget the facts and the narrative can be skewed in the court of public opinion. 
 




 It's not misleading. There still isn't any justice for Tamir Rice and his loved ones.  




 Latest? This happened long before Freddie Gray was murdered.  









 That's very true. Historians generally agree that there was a man named Yeshua. It doesn't mean that there's solid evidence. I've heard this argument hundreds of times, but I've never seen any convincing evidence. No one wrote about him during the period he would have been alive.  




 Yep. Most of the racists left the Democratic party after the Civil Rights movement.  




 Came here to say that Captain D's is far superior. Fuck Long John Silvers.  




 Yeah, fuck best buy!  




 Sounds like an interesting and depressing class.  




 Yeah. It kind of illustrates how meaningless that award is, doesn't it.  




 East Cape Girardeau is barely even a town. It's more like a couple of trailer parks and a strip club.

 There's much more to it than that. Read The Trial of Henry Kissingser. The guy's a fucking scumbag.

 No, Hard Candy is about a young girl who resorts to vigilante justice against the child predators who killed her friend.  




 Can you explain. My grandma raised chickens until all of her kids grew and moved out. I don't remember anything about it being expensive and sure cleaning chickens is work, but I wouldn't say it's the worst thing in the world. If it was expensive I can't imagine my grandparents would have had anything to do with it.  




 Not necessarily. You do have the option of raising your own chickens for meat and eggs.  




 Fuck everything about this. Sounds like another department that should be disbanded.  




 This shouldn't have been deleted. This isn't exclusively political.  




 That's sad. They can't properly celebrate murder with a memorial to the victim around.  




 How the hell does shipping meat thousands of miles away for processing and then returning it save any money?  




 You're a drooling idiot.  




 It may have something to do with the municipality. Walmart gets a lot of money for development and tax breaks from. local communities. I imagine that that some cities want to see a certain number of positions in return for their investments.  




 Employers have every right to prohibit their employees from even using tobacco products. You don't have to be a police officer. You can choose to find work in a different industry.  




 No, your job should prohibit you from using steroids and most mind altering chemicals.  




 Summary execution.  




 Right, without the government there would be multiple providers. Except that's not true at all. Without government there would be one provider still and we would not have the internet. 

 




 What the hell are you talking about?  




 No, it's definitely [corporatism] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism) responsible here.

We don't have that in this country. We have many industries that aren't properly regulated in this and many other areas. We've allowed the ruling class to rule both the economy and the political process.  




 I like what you have to say. I see no reason why a combination of software and hardware can't do better than 80%. That's a disturbing number considering that there are laser corrective machines that basically correct ones vision to 20/20. 




 Yeah let me rephrase that.  




 You're talking about laser surgery. We were talking about laser diagnostics.  




 I would prefer it never had any public funding. I don't care what stupid people do **in their homes and churches** as long as they pay their taxes. 

Edit:added bold text.  




 Violence always begets violence. 

I would argue that fascist policies and horrific circumstances have put religious fundamentalists, who are sometimes also rapists, in power in Afghanistan . I don't know enough about Afghanistan to form the most well rounded argument. If I had to chance a guess about the current political, social, or economic situation there, I would start with the total war that has occurred there in the last forty years or so. Then i would move on to the intermittent and half-assed efforts (if even that) at rebuilding and supporting those people you hate. This dipshittery comes from mostly people you think are superior, they were the major parties from the beginning to our current untenable situation. 

[Afghanistan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Afghanistan) has a long and beautiful history that is both multicultural and worth learning about. What has happened there is truly horrific. But, it's easy to knock a place and a people because of its current situation. 

I mean the best time to assess the United States and it's cultural developments would have been in the last third of the Civil War, right?

 I dunno, you tell me.  




 The visual information that comes from your eyes is more fucked up than you think. It's not that we have too many receptors in the middle of the eye, or even the fact that we have an [actual blind spot in the middle of each eye] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)). As far as I understand it, it's the complexity of the eye's shape, the photo receptors, and how they interrelate to the brain. We unfortunately possess much of the same eye structure of that of a fish. Of course light works differently underwater* and so does pressure.  




 Explain to me OP, how this is more of a failure of the president than it is the legislature. Each time a reasonable bill is presented to properly fund any amount of reform, the GOP dominated legislature slashes and trims it* into ineffectualism. It's convenient to attack the president, but a little research will reveal to you that the bill he supported was defeated and replaced with a joke that provides one tenth of the funding as was intended.  




 Antitrust!? That's socialism!!  




 We have and continue to do so. The depth of that problem is abysmal.  




 Corporatism in action.  




 I wouldn't either, but I certainly wouldn't blame Islam solely for their fucked up behavior and beliefs, anymore than I would blame my mother and her religion for the ku klux klan.  




 No one is perfect. Hitchens was antitheistic. Islam is an easy target. In some locations Islam is the major religious threat to rationalism and secular society. But, in mine for example, Southeast Missouri, Christianity threatens secularism and rational decision making.  




 How do you figure?  




 This kind of shit is why I'm in other threads arguing against blanket incarceration.  




 If you feel it did then I'm satisfied.  




 You should know about [Poe's Law.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)

I have no love for any religion but I like people and I have a few friends who are Muslim. Seem like regular guys to me. They appreciate the secular aspect of our government and treat me, an atheist, with the same respect and dignity as anyone else.  




 I think I understand what you're getting at, though I disagree with the analogy of eating dogs as there are valid arguments against that, I think I agree with you. 

Really, I am glad they're offended. I'm offended each time a child is taught about hell and how they and everyone they love is going there if they fail to live up to "god's will". I'm offended by their often successful attempts to push religious indoctrination into science class or any other aspect of public education. I'm offended by the mutilation that was perpetrated on me and  the other **billions of defenseless children**. I'm offended by their attempts to subvert our secular government. I'm offended by their lack of humanity, tolerance, and compassion. 

If they choose to be offended by two adults who love each other and want to make it official, then shame on them. They're only showing their own asses. History will not be kind.  




 I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in an appropriate facility in this case. Maybe you should read through the thread a bit before commenting. 

Edit: Since you so cowardly deleted the comment I'll ask your question again and answer it. 

OP: "I don't disagree" is vague, do you think that this ruling might have been correct? 

I do. 

I'm not a Swede. I'm not one of the Swedish caseworkers, judges, lawyers, or jurors involved in this case. I dont know this young man who was a minor child when he committed this heinous crime. I don't know his background, his medical history, or what types of horrors or abuses he was exposed to in Somalia. I don't think that you fit any of these qualifications either. But, now that you're asking me questions again, I'll repeat myself:

Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? 

Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? 

You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  




 I've never worn contacts and probably never will. I don't mind glasses, as long as I can get a prescription as often as I need. I'm seem to be in need of a new pair as lines are starting to slant a bit. I don't understand the allure of contacts. I can't stand touching my eyes and eye infections are terrible.  




 I'm an American. Criticizing the government is what we do. How is it hypocritical to criticize my own government when it is known to be draconian in the implementation of its laws? How is it hypocrisy to appreciate another country who is taking a different approach. Maybe you're confused about the definition of hypocrisy:

hypocrisy

hpkrs/

noun

the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.

synonyms:dissimulation,false virtue,cant,posturing,affectation,speciousness,empty talk,insincerity,falseness,deceit,dishonesty,mendacity,pretense,duplicity;More

That should clear up any confusion that you're experiencing.  




 I'm assuming that you've only read the two posts that you've responded to. Shame on you. I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in some sort of youth correctional facility. But either way, it's not our decision to make. 

I have a couple of questions for you? Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  




 Cool, thanks.  




 I dunno. Ask /u/abortionaut. He seems to be all for it. I'm sure he'd take a page or two from the works of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich.  




 I'm not sure what you're getting at. I personally think this kid should have to do a couple of years in juvenile or some kind of Center for youth offenders. But it's not my decision to make. 

What happened to that girl is terrible and the offender needs to be dealt with. I'm assuming you're an American by your vengeful attitude and you posting this shitty article that mentions Anders Breivik as if he was somehow relevant to this case. Perhaps you can put your thirst for blood aside and consider the long term consequences of incarceration and what goals are ultimately meant to be achieved.  




 Fine points. I agree that education needs to be the foundation if we're going to effect any real change in the US. More needs to be done to eliminate the root causes of poverty itself, which are manifold. I know a lot of conservatives like to cite welfare programs as creating a culture of dependency, but I think that's disingenuous. 

We have for several decades, fostered a very lucrative black market for several plants and compounds that we know will always command a certain level of demand. Instead of allowing criminal individuals and organizations to profit from these markets we should decriminalize, legalize, and heavily regulate even the most illicit substances. (It's ironic that the federal government still views cannabis as one of the most dangerous compounds known to mankind) A good example of the effects of sufficient regulation and taxation would be the [trend of teen smoking] (http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/substance-abuse/tobacco/trends.html) over the last forty years or so. 

I know this may sound simplistic initially, but it can be done. And yes, I'm talking about the legalization and heavy regulation of stuff like heroin and meth. You may or may not know that in much of the country we already give addicts methadone and other analogues to heroin in very strict and supervised environments. Methadone is not demonstrably safer or less addictive than pharmaceutical heroin. Hell, methamphetamine is a prescribable medication under US law, and we prescribe Adderall and other amphetamines to children (which I do not advocate. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of our draconian drug laws) 

If all of these things were reasonably and inexpensively obtainable under rationally controlled and supervised conditions, it would render black markets unprofitable. In the meanwhile, we can actually address the problems by requiring counseling and offering treatment to addicts. Dismantling the drug cartels and offering a safe and controlled environment for addicts takes them out of their comfort zones. I can't imagine many people saying to themselves "I've never had it so, I'd like to go down to the clinic and try some heroin or crack". But, I'd prefer that if they felt that strongly about it, they had access to a clinic with mandatory counseling and safe conditions rather than being fodder for pimps and other types of undesirables in flop houses and whatnot. Prohibiting drugs puts drugs in the hands of criminals. I hear this argument in regards to gun legislation all of the time but rarely do I hear a rational proposition for dealing with our country's drug problems. 

 




 I'm not sure what you're getting at, but what does race have to do with this?  




 I don't disagree, but there was no murder in this case.  




 Where in the text does it say that we have an inalienable right to own and bear assault rifles or even pistols?  We have a Supreme Court to interpret the text of the constitution. I'm not accusing you personally of this, but I think it's odd how some find it convenient to forget the way the system works when they're faced with a ruling that they disagree with. 

All of this hullabaloo about gay marriage is extremely odd to me considering how it literally affects no one but LGBT people and their immediate families. This has absolutely no effect on Christians, their churches, or their closely held beliefs.  




 Let's hope she finds a better job in a substantially less hateful environment.  




 We do. And we have a longstanding court defined by that document to interpret those rights. They've ruled some fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered in the protections enumerated by the constitution.  




 Christian conservatives and other prolifers.  




 He* grew up in New Madrid, MO. That's just down the road from here. My grandparents lived there for a time when I was young.  




 It seems kinda sad. I know they were violent criminals, but I didn't realize that they would be denied a proper grave this way. Not that I'm saying it's wrong. It's just surprising.  




 I've experienced some of that. The last time I got a new prescription, I hadn't been wearing glasses for a few months because they were broken. When I received the new pair my tablet appeared to be a slight trapezoid instead of perfect rectangle for a couple of weeks. I had to be careful going up and down stairs. Thanks for the info, Doc.  




 Nor should marriage lose its privileged state. The sanctions and privileges afforded to married couples are there to support social stability, family planning, and child rearing. I can't think of a single reason these things shouldn't be available to gay couples as well as straight couples. It's good for families.  




 If it's an issue of a personal inalienable right, which the right to marry the person of choice certainly is, it's not up to the state whether it should be allowed or not.  




 Marriage is a legal term. It's been one for quite some time.  




 No you're right /u/abortionaut. We should look at statistics on crime and race, ignore all other socioeconomic factors at play, round up the offending ethnicities, and put them in camps and deport them. /s

Edit:grammar  




 I'm glad it offends him. He like everyone else, needs to learn that we as Americans do not have a right to not be offended by things, and especially not the freedom of others.  




 Which is right up Rand Paul's alley.  




 That's nonsense. Race doesn't make a person more likely to commit crimes.  




 So they give out that information to visitors?  




 I have astigmatism and slight nearsightedness and it seems like they can never get my glasses right. I put up with it and just wear them. My wife is the same way. Would I be better off just asking for this procedure? Is it expensive?  




 Looking back at your comments, I'm curious as to why you chose to focus on that study while ignoring the definition of recidivism provided at the top of the page in question. 

Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that resulted in rearrest, reconviction or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release.

Is it because this very relevant definition hurts your argument, and the study works as a fantastic distraction from that fact?  




 Who said anything about giving anyone a pass? I'm saying that it's wrong to suggest that someone is a criminal because of their religious background. Not that it's okay to assume* that everyone who is religious is a criminal or to give anyone a pass. I guess I could link to the strawman Wikipedia article here if I wanted to be a condescending jerk.  




 Did you even read the article?  




 Excellent article. Priceless photo of Trump.  




 What's conservative or short sighted about opposing an ideology that is inherently anti-women and anti-gay? 

You mean like Christianity? 

 




 Are you suggesting that there is racial profiling being perpetuated against white folks?  




 It's not exactly accurate. It isn't a person's race that makes them commit crimes.  




 Interesting post. I was surprised to learn that these graves don't even have names on their markers. I understand the purpose in burying them in this manner, but shouldn't the families still allowed to locate and visit their deceased loved ones?  




 I don't disagree that culture is part of it. But it's difficult to tackle the problems presented by cultural backgrounds without first addressing poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors. It's not like one can strip a person of their cultural background nor should they. There are absolutely aspects of some cultures that are harmful to women and other minorities. It's a difficult problem to address. I guess the idea is that once a person or group is appropriately educated and raised from poverty, these other issues should take care of themselves. I don't disagree that there is a certain amount of assimilation that can and should be expected from immigrants entering a country.  




 It's not relevant as I am an American and have every right to expect to have a say in the functions of my Democratic Republic. I'm not saying that you can't have an opinion about Sweden. I'm saying that it's unqualified and valueless so don't expect anyone to listen to it or care. You have no authority there. Not even a vote. 

You have no reason to label me a hypocrite. 

And I will continue to live in the US and vote in every election cycle, thank you very much.  




 Why would I be arguing about Saudi Arabia? How is that relevant to this discussion? 

I'm comforted by* the fact that you have no authority on* any of these topics and cannot enact your draconian will upon others. 

You didn't address the fact that here in the US, we frequently toss juvenile offenders into adult prisons where they are habitually beaten, raped and otherwise abused for much of their adult lives. I'm assuming that this fact doesn't bother you. 

Please don't talk to me about morality or what is just.  




 This "man" was a 17 year old juvenile offender.  




 Again, you're missing the point. Without a control group, like people who received community service and probation, such research only shows part of the pictures. 

Also this study has no effect on the definition of the term. An offender doesn't have to have spent time in prison in order to be considered a repeat offender. That's just obvious.  




 It may not be common knowledge, but those suffering from mental illness are statistically no more likely than the general population to commit acts of violence. The truth is that* the mentally ill are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. 

I don't think anyone would argue that this crime is excused by whatever psychological issues he may be experiencing, but there's no question that such things should be considered during sentencing.  




 That's one study. Not all research on recidivism would only follow exprisoners. That would be a mistake as there would be nothing to compare the recidivism rates of prisoners vs other types of punishment.  




 recidivism


\ri-si-d-vi-zm\noun

:a tendency to relapse into a previous condition or mode of behavior;especially:relapse into criminal behavio


http://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/pages/welcome.aspx

It's generally used to describe a return to criminal behavior. Obviously we shouldn't be returning people to prison who haven't done anything wrong, right?  




 I am American and I firmly believe our system is worse than backward. It's completely counterproductive and criminal in and of itself. Our penal system has a long track record of making criminals more depraved and incapable or rehabilitation. 

Sure just punishment is warranted, but you could hardly argue that throwing juveniles into adult prison to be abused, beaten, and raped to be "just punishment" without some serious cognitive dissonance. What's the point in punishing offenders in a way that denies their humanity and violates our own? It doesn't change the past, and the end result is an offender who's more fucked up psychologically and less capable of functioning and participating in society.  




 The duty is to all of society, not only the immediate victim. Yes prison is usually necessary in the case of rape. I wouldn't argue with that point. I will argue that's it's not your place or mine to decide what judges, juries, and lawyers should do with a juvenile offender in their own sovereign state. If Sweden prefers the focuses of their criminal justice system to be on providing aid to victims, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism  then that's their right.  




 If anything, recidivism rates should be higher in a system where only the most serious criminals end up in prison in the first place.


I'm not convinced that Sweden has such a system. This offender was a juvenile under their legal definition. For better or worse this is why he avoided prison time. And why would they be higher? Recidivism is about reoffending not about returning to prison.  




 If you're not willing to rely on facts or provide any sources, why do you insist on being involved in this discussion?  




 You're assuming so much with your statements. First and foremost, you're assuming that you have the knowledge, understanding, and authority to be making decisions about what should be done to this juvenile offender in a foreign country. Because he's an immigrant you're assuming that he's not a citizen. 

I don't disagree that a sexual offender deserves prison time. But I don't assume to be qualified or justified in telling a foreign sovereign state how to handle its internal affairs.  




 I don't disagree that there should be a focus on protecting the innocent. But it's not up to you or I to decide whether this juvenile offender is likely to reoffend or not. What are they going to keep him in prison for the rest of his life? That doesn't seem appropriate or necessary. 

Also, your comment violates rule 2 in the sidebar which I politely invite you to read.  




 From the way I understand it, Breivik will most likely be in prison for the rest of his life. That 21 year sentence is the "punishment" for his crimes, but the way his sentence works is that the state can choose to keep him behind bars if he's deemed to still be a threat to society. 

Edit: It's worth pointing out that Breivik and his crimes were in Norway.
