 Dude you had Red Bulls flair a few months ago. 




 They are on the verge of being relegated from the 2.Bundesliga and Bobby Wood hasn't been successful there himself. 




 This is what I was referring to, thanks.  




 If you run racist promos on someone, you better not go over.  




 I'd be happy if the local affiliates picked up the local team's game each round.  




 I don't see where you saw that at all. And that last sentence of yours seems to be reminiscent of predisposed bias.  




 You're my new favorite poster. 




 TEAMS WITH STADIUMS NAMED AFTER TOYOTA: FC DALLAS AND CHICAGO FIRE. SO THERE ARE TWO TEAMS YOU'RE TALKING SHIT ON.

 WILD THING... 




 Hey, Red Bull.

Can you hear me? I said, **hey, Red Bull!**

**YO, RED BULL!** 

Glad I got your attention. You might make some of your fans happy again if you got on this. He'd be nice slotted next to Dax McCarty. Sure, your fans will still be bad about the missing Petke, but this will help put to rest the rumors about cost-cutting and shifting all of your resources to Leipzig.  




 Luis Silva is still healthy, right? Is Conor Doyle healthy again?  




 Beeeee (or Jaaay?) 









 The movie with Al Pacino is freaking awesome, and would be loved by nearly everyone on this subreddit. Seriously, watch it.  




 You do realize it's used that way as a sectarian slur against those entities because of Shi'i connections?   




 Old Bay tastes good on everything.  
























 It's a slur/perjorative not just used by Daesh and Nusra, but also used by those prejudiced against Shi'i, who are also present in Iraq.  




 Why are you using that word? It's been quite a few centuries now.  




 Of all the countries, how did Lebanon end up with the most conservative of the costumes? Is there a cultural revolution occurring there that I'm not hearing about?

  I put green/red chile on everything as my main spice, so sometimes things feel off without it 

Bro, Indians/Pakistanis do the same thing. You might like their cuisine, as it has a few similarities with Middle Eastern cuisine and is spicy. 




 The Washington Nationals used to be the Montreal Expos, actually. 

The team that used to be the Washington Senators is now the Texas Rangers.  




 You're no longer female or an IT manager?  




 Taking a 34-year-old third stringer was the right decision over taking a someone else who is more than 10 years younger?  




 Thank you for actually answering my question.  









 It's off the hizzle f'shizzle my cupcizzle.  




 Is Ryder healthy yet?  









 I hope AJ Soares signs with Hellas Verona soon so the U.S. has another standard-bearer in Serie A.

 This would be an absolute disaster considering the new TV deal, the new teams coming into the league and the new DPs this year.  




 Daily Mail: Mastroeni's mustache has been transferred to Everton FC for a transfer fee said to be in the $6-8 million range. 

Roberto Martinez is said to be delighted with the mustache arrival: "Now I can look like one of those old-time Arab sheikhs from black and white cinema. I'm hoping that will attract the attention of some wealthy Gulf investors to Everton." 




 Hey, that's not nice to Ray Gaddis! And I don't see as much Union as I like, so is Fabinho really that bad?  




 Are you sure they don't contradict BDS? These are sponsored trips paid for by organizations which do financial as well as public relations support for the Israeli government and military. 

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BDS/comments/2r5tw1/and_the_faithwashing_continues_second_cohort_of/) is about the same issue and did not receive any sort of comment from you. The only difference with the story is that it is a history and summary of the trips along with the backlash to them. Rather than posting six or so links on the issue, I thought this would be a good sum up piece.  




 Upper eastern shore? The county wouldn't happen to rhyme with Beecil, would it?  









 If he gets US citizenship later, can't he switch then? This isn't a senior national team cap for a competitive match.

 Honestly, I never saw it spelled wrong online until I came to Reddit. It's insane.  




 Baltimore isn't getting an MLS team anytime soon :( 




 Putting a USL-Pro team in South Texas is a brilliant move. You're tapping an area with a hotbed of soccer talent that normally looks at Mexico for opportunities.

 Don't sit in the supporter's section and sit far away (as close to the opposite end as possible) and you shouldn't hear any of that.  




 How are they fitting all of this under the cap??? 




 Saddam?  




 Steve Nicol with New England too. And he did a pretty good job, aside from the lack of MLS Cups. 




 Ok, U.S. Soccer and MLS need to embrace Alianza full stop. Don't lose talent that might otherwise end up with other CONCACAF national teams or Liga MX.  




 Sometimes it causes it. And I only ever get the fish.  




 Nice backpedaling. When you use words like "savages, shithole countries, pitiful sand covered shithole, and uneducated barbaric savages," you're attacking everybody, not just the extremists, and you alienate everyone else. If someone doesn't feel like their country doesn't accept them, they'll look for acceptance elsewhere. And besides that, don't learn about religion from some news articles about tragedies. There's a billion-plus other people who don't do messed up stuff.  




 Pegida, National Front, British National Party, Party for Freedom or one of the other far-right parties in Europe? Or do you hang out on the right here in the States? Or elsewhere? Whatever the case, there's nothing you can do about immigrants or a Muslim presence. The more you ostracize them, the more you'll push them to the militants. Best to get along with them as best you can and, dare I say it, consider them your fellow citizens and natives. They will have a different color of skin than you and have different names than you. They likely will follow a different religion than you. Deal with it. Because humanity doesn't have a good track record of excluding humans because they "aren't like us." If you're in Europe, look backward about seventy-plus years. Or heck, [just three years back to this guy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) Because that's the end game of your ideology.  




 Donetsk isn't even playing in Donetsk right now. There's been quite an exodus from the Ukranian League since the separatism.

shithole countries
if these immigrant savages don't like how things run over there, they can fuck off back to their pitiful, sand-covered shithole.
uneducated, barbaric savages.

Bigoted xenophobe confirmed. Attitudes like yours are repulsive and in many ways are more of a recruiting tool than any takfiri website.  




 Cahill may be on international duty a lot, and if you guys play with two strikers he might be needed.  




 He's remarked quite publicly that he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with Jurgen. Plus, they are both two former forwards with big egos.  




 I can't see Jurgen being okay with a move to Qatar, or even Greece, the one time haven of Eddie Johnson and Freddy Adu. Even Russia these days is probably unfriendly to American citizens, let alone those who play for the national team.  




 Qatar? Greece? Ukraine? 

Who would mess with any of those countries for soccer right now?  




 Ba dum tish 




 This was actually a legit reason for RBNY to back out.  




 Meanwhile, Ethan Finlay was not called into the U.S. camp. A little hope for you guys.  




 This is the best thing to do. While spreading cartoons may make you feel like such a great Free Speech Warrior^TM , these websites are the main recruiting and propaganda tool for these groups. One of the reasons that journalists are executed by them is that they don't see the point when they put out their own videos.  




 Two years ago, [Petke] made a birthday video for my seven year old son wishing him a happy birthday and telling him to keep practicing playing soccer and maybe one day, he would play for him, Ader recalls. Talk about youth development! To have the coach who the kids watch every game say something like that  it really changed his life. Now he is nine and playing soccer everyday, five days a week. I know that role model was key part of it. I am forever grateful to that and for that.


Why did they fire Petke again?  




 To be fair, Mix hasn't exactly been acting coherent on Twitter lately.  




 Don't the Red Bulls have a discovery claim on him? 




 Some of the teams pay their players, which is why it's semipro.  




 The trapped migrant workers aren't lucky enough to live in houses. They have shantytowns, tenements and trailers. These would be the middle-class, somewhat better off white collar and service workers.  









 Monkey logic, indeed.  




 **Submission Statement:**

The article by Teju Cole looks at some of the underlying issues behind the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including the magazine's history of provocation on ethnic, religious and racial lines. It also points out double standards on the deaths of innocents in other places, as well as on free speech itself.  














   Contrary to outsiders view of Israeli society Israelis actually don't particularly like military campaigns because it means calling on the reserves. 

Does not compute with what you just said.  




 In the first few games called up under Klinsmann, he played really well. Assisted on two goals in two different games against Mexico. Perhaps Klinsmann thinks he can still build on that.  




 Set up the goal in Klinsmann's first game in charge, set up the goal in our first victory in Mexico... yup pretty good track record.

Of the three players involved in that first goal (**EDIT**: changed from game) under Klinsmann (Agudelo, Shea and Rogers), only Shea is left standing, oddly.  




 Andrew Wooten is an American who is playing far better in the 2.Bundesliga.  




 Maybe he's going with a five man backline and wants D-Mid type CBs.  




 What's wrong with him playing for Canada? We've stolen quite a few already (looks like Akindele too) from them, so if they get one or two to switch from the U.S., I'm not going to stress.  




 Why is it that every military campaign has something like 80-90 percent approval among the Israeli public?  




 Nobody ever really had anything bad to say about him from that team.  




 [You didn't know he got hair plugs?](http://i31.tinypic.com/x575dv.jpg) 




 Believe it a not, Muslim is actually a first name too. So he can go by that. He already has a beard.  




 Grant Wahl, the source of this thread, is part of the American press.... 




 Israel likes to schedule their military campaigns near elections. It helps with votes.  




 Kind of sad to read this, looking back. 




 They all have players' unions that have fought like hell to get decent treatment for the athletes, and also give them legal recourse in the event there are disagreements.  




 Brek Shea's one good season got him doing Adidas commercials. 

And how could you say [Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqO1fcU5hk4) isn't marketable?  




 The better question is, why aren't any of the other 18 teams doing so (excluding the Diskerud and Shea situations? 




 Before his disastrous move to Stoke and subsequent injury, Edu was ahead of Beckerman on the USMNT depth chart.  




 Who wants to bet the season ticket holders will be cherrypicked?  




 Switch the two. You have to take Chief Charisma into account after all.  




 He's the UK Muslim version of Fred Phelps.  




 In our bubbles near major cities, we don't see it, but in middle America and the south, and in conservative areas, FOX is the news network of choice. That's a lot of people.  




 If foreign clubs can pay more, MLS academies could lose their best talent.  




 There's nothing in our holy book to back up terrorism.

 J and J Security would be perfect for this.  




 They won't take the Gaxaly route? Phew, I thought that it said they won't take the Galaxy route. That would be stupid, considering the Galaxy has a nice balance of young talent and foreign stars.  




 At a time when Klinsmann is apparently recommending that young players go overseas, this does not bode well for the league keeping the talent developed in its academies.  




 Why not Berry and Valdes? Austin is still there, right?  




 No, that's Dafoe.

 Start with two through four in that order, and don't limit yourself when it comes to Islamic scholars. Sunni, Shia, etc. all should be explored. You'll have some issues if you don't know Arabic and Farsi for this, as translated works aren't as widespread as they should be.  

However, most of the world's Muslims don't speak these languages (part of the reason is a lack of education), yet they still understand many concepts both basic and not so basic. Most of the world's extremists either haven't read up or have merely seen the most extreme of sources.

After you've learned a bit from scholars and scripture, you'll be able to get a better picture of what's wrong with extremists. At least I hope so.  




 That is some of the most severe right wing propaganda that I have ever read. You're taking some kind social media activism as some kind of organized campaign by the radical left, when really it's slacktivism at worst and legitimate activism as best. Your hatred seems to be directed at "social justice," as well as any sort of left leaning ideology. 

They work hand in glove with race-baiters and use ridiculous theories to convince the uneducated that somehow someone else is responsible for their lot in life. They promote debunked Marxist and Communist economics and politics as solutions for the 'injustice' of our society. They erroneously believe confiscation and redistribution of wealth by the government (with special groups like themselves getting a cut) will solve critical fundamental flaws actually caused by poor quality education and the effective dissolution of families, particularly in the black community. And they use every opportunity to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, usually by playing the race card. Assault, defamation, harassment, innuendo, libel and lies, rumor, slander, threats and violence are their tools of the trade - manipulation of the uneducated masses to accede to their wishes (money and power) is their goal.

My God, it's like I'm reading a tea-party manifesto. 

 SJW, race-baiters, and environmentalists are really nothing more than shakedown artists. They vampire ludicrous amounts of resources but contribute nothing positive to society, and are deserving of all the derision and ridicule they get, IMHO.

Yeah, I'm going to just call you a far-right extremist. That's enough internet for me today.  




 You're completely wrong. The majority of Muslims don't act like animals. Just look at the UK, where most Muslims are fine. France has five million Muslims, the most in Europe, and this is the first terrorist attack of its kind. 

I'm just glad I live in the United States. At least the bigots don't make like difficult for us here, and we tend to be successful. In Europe, we're shoved into ghettos and poverty.  




 What's wrong with that?  




 I think the term's use as an insult is idiotic. The irony of someone campaigning for the internet would be a "warrior" coupled with the fact that they are doing so for a good cause (social justice) and the fact that some people think that's worthy of derision.  




 I've seen dozens of names both cultural and religious, from both Pakistanis, Arabs, Iranians, Afghans, etc. Perhaps it's just where you're at.  




 My whole argument is that Islam teaches NOT to kill people just for having different opinions. This isn't berating, this is arguing. I apologize if you think that's what it is. I don't know if I can convince you of that. Perhaps I can't, but I had to try. Please don't hold prejudice or violence in your heart against Islam. Muslims are full of flaws, but the ones responsible for the attack went beyond the bounds of Islam. That's all that I wanted to say.  




 No, you misunderstand. "The entire religion" doesn't subscribe to one belief because there's no central authority. His ideas are perfectly valid, and I agree. But there's a written tradition from one of the Prophet's descendants: "Don't judge the religion by its followers. Judge the followers by the religion."  




  why issue fatwas on everything disagreeable

This doesn't make sense. Avoid rulings on controversial topics?  




 It just basically said making the cartoons depicting his face or insulting him isn't allowed. It didn't come with any kind of penalty.  




 TIL my religion is apparently defined by polls.  




 There's no central leadership in Islam. So that's not valid.  




 Ironically, they are killing Muslims. 




 Reading a few news articles doesn't mean you know my religion.  




 You haven't met that many Muslims, have you? 




 Beliefs based on faith are not irrational, saying stuff like that pisses off the majority of people of faith, normal or extreme, Muslim, Christian or whatever.  




 Ah yes, even when we condemn it, we're lying! I don't care what you think. I know very well what Islam teaches, having been raised in it, and I and most other Muslims know this is wrong, and you don't get to tell me what I "actually" believe. 




 Hey, you used to have Red Bulls flair... 




 That's a myth. Muslims speak out against such things all the time but it never gets coverage. http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/muslim_voices_against_extremism_and_terrorism_part_i_fatwas/ 




 His name is Anjem Chaudary, not Armen, and he's basically the Fred Phelps of UK Muslims. He doesn't enjoy much support and every legitimate Muslim organization has condemned him.

 If I was Clint Irwin I'd be worried. This is a much safer replacement move than the completely insane Joe Nasco experiment of last year. Irwin still hasn't done anything in my opinion to lose the job, which leads me to believe Mastroeni just doesn't like him for some reason.

 That's not what I meant. Cherundolo had a solid but not spectacular career for Hannover and the USMNT. I'd be happy if Yedlin merely reached that level, but to be honest that is the minimum I expect from him. 

And the USMNT is pretty deep at RB. Fabian Johnson, Geoff Cameron and Timmy Chandler can all play there. Yedlin may end up being a marquee right midfielder or winger.
