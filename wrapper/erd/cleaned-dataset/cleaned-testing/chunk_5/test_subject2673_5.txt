 You're implying that the President is directly responsible for the treatment (not just the policies regarding treatment) of certain minorities by different agencies in the government. "Treatment" is a very personal problem as well: even if we lay rules down, will it guarantee that everyone will be treated the same in all instances of personal interactions within these agencies? In my opinion the two issues you mentioned are completely unrelated. 




 Today I listened to MD rapper Logic's new-ish mixtape: [Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever](http://www.datpiff.com/Logic-Young-Sinatra-Welcome-To-Forever-mixtape.483644.html). If you don't have time to download, check out the song [Nasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVbTkFsCc24) (YouTube link) from his mixtape. Very lyrical with a sick beat.  
  
My opinion:  
Overall the mixtape has some solid lyricism and production. There are two skits which I found pretty hilarious. One involves his dad coming into the room while he's recording, and the following exchange is pretty hilarious. He recently signed to Def Jam and is planning to release an LP soon I believe. Worth checking out. 




 150 pounds or kilos? Also the less fat you have on your body, the better shape you'll be in to pass. You can buy self-test kits from a CVS if you live near one. If you take it in the morning, make sure you wake up early, piss, and drink lots of water to dilute your piss for the test. There is a certain vitamin you can take to help cleanse but I forgot which one; it's definitely worth a google. Good luck man. 




 Hello ents,

I come to you today with a problem. The weed I have right now is a very potent unnamed indica strain. I smoke out of a triple-percolated chandelier bong. The problem is, after taking only two hits (around 0.5g) of this stuff, I get a very strong body high and begin to feel drowsy.

Do any of you have any advice on how to stay awake after getting a strong body high? Should I change my method of smoking? I also have a bowl and papers if that helps, but I prefer the bong since it's smoother.

Any advice is welcome. 




 The title is very misleading. Causation cannot be established between the reclassification of a substance and increased rates of psychosis. This is because the latter implies usage, and usage implies possession. Possession is achieved through illegal means anyway, therefore the legal reclassification of a substance bears no correlation to increased rates of psychosis. 




 Cockroaches, as long as they aren't where you live. There is nothing inherently "gross" about these bugs, but having them in your home is obviously undesirable. I once asked a friend why he thought cockroaches were gross and he replied, "They can like, survive a nuclear holocaust dude." I wasn't sure how to respond. 




 I wish I had a table of all the techniques of differentiation,  integration, and construction of power series stored in my head so I could readily apply the most effective techniques when attempting to solve problems in applied math when calculus is involved. 




 Hadn't watched a truly "sad" movie until one fateful summer night... I decided to get relatively high and watch The Notebook by myself. By the end I was bawling my eyes out. It was a very powerful emotional experience and I would recommend it to anyone with a decent understanding of interpersonal relationships. 




 Great read, it really sheds some light on how hard it is to parse C. Edge cases are awesome 




 Superbad. The characters are so believable and it's so over the top you can't stop laughing. 




 That's pretty unfortunate. I can see why you were apprehensive when shaking someone's hand. Still not sure why my comment got downvoted though, I feel like it's a relatively civil approach to the problem. 




 Strong AI 




 If I'm at work or in a formal setting, ignore it. If it's a casual or random encounter, I ask them directly why they don't feel comfortable shaking my hand. The ball is in their court at this point. 




 Says Linus is using intimidation and violence. Uses an expletive and threats of "not being a nice girl anymore".

This is very unprofessional and her concerns have been greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately, immature people who can't understand mature humor are everywhere. Dealing with it is the hard part; just recognize stupid when you see it, don't antagonize, and move on. 




 this is a gif right dude [8[ 




 Dat misleading title. Quote from the article: "Wyden said he imagines the White House is willing to reconsider the current surveillance policies in place"... This is nothing more than speculation. Move along. 




 Good old perspective projection. Well done OP. 




 w.. woah dude be careful theyre gonna fall [7] 




 this doesn't introduce any new attack vectors for malware, therefore this changes nothing 




 ITT: people's pet peeves 




 Listen to lots of your favorite music. It helps keep my mind off things, I hope it can help you too. 




 You're right. I think media outlets should have stressed the importance of providing troubled teenagers with the right kind of help instead of focusing on the age-old gun violence debate. It is a little known fact that even mentally stable people can benefit from therapy or counseling. I think the problem now is a combination of growing up in the information age as well as having to deal with stresses like school and work. Parents should be educated and made aware of certain signs that indicate their child is having a hard time. This should assist them in finding their teenager the right kind of help.  
  
When it comes to giving actual advice to parents with teenagers though, it seems like a tremendously difficult undertaking; I wouldn't even know where to begin. 




 "the terrorists"  
  
You use those words as if you're implying these people are acting as a group, which couldn't be further from reality. There are domestic as well as foreign terrorists, whose motivations range from hatred of the U.S. and its citizens to crazy, irrational reasons. I think the threat of terrorism has been overemphasized as well as blown out of proportion by the U.S. media.  
  
"Their job", I would say, is dependent on the individual terrorist's motivation. Therefore, determining "whether they have done their job" wouldn't be proving anything.

 My personal suggestions: ArsTechnica and New York Times.  
  
Already mentioned: NPR, BBC, Al Jazeera, Guardian, The Independent 




 In general, "are we better off than we would be if..."-type questions rarely seem to elicit responses that are based on more than mere conjecture. I suggest avoiding those types of questions when possible, and instead asking a more relevant, focused question such as, "What would be the implications of restricting the NSA's access to our personal information, and what role would this play in the NSA's ongoing mission of protecting America?" 




 Yeah most parents are idiots 




 The overall effectiveness of preventing unwanted surveillance using encryption is entirely dependent on the implementation of the software utilizing a myriad of cryptographic methods to secure any sensitive data involved.

eli5: If software you are using encrypts or exchanges data incorrectly, your data could be seen by other people. 




 Computer programming. Unfortunately, in the industry, managers will often throw more software engineers at a project instead of giving the existing team more time. But to be fair, managers are not always in charge of deadlines, and management style differs drastically depending on the person as well as the company. So yeah, try to code slowly folks. Doing so will help decrease the total number of bugs in the software and ensure proper functionality for release.  edit: grammar
