 From your comments below, you are asking if there is an advantage to applying to the same institution for graduate school that you attend as an undergraduate?  Sorry if I'm getting that wrong.

In some fields, the answer is no.  You are encouraged to go to a new institution for graduate school, and to still another for a postdoc or other subsequent academic job.  This allows you to be exposed to new ideas and philosophies.

However, I don't know about math specifically, so it would be a good idea to ask your academic advisor. 




 That is really cool!  I think there's some research showing that bees can also retain memories of positive/negative odors through metamorphosis.

I guess another thing this reminds me of is that as part of their efforts to read aloud to us, my parents (especially my dad) read some biographies of great scientists, and other science-related books; I can remember him reading us *Microbe Hunters* when I was in kindergarten.  I didn't necessarily understand all (or even much) of books like that when I was that young, but it meant I was already engaging with descriptions of how science works, what an experiment is, etc.  There are some really wonderful childrens' and adult science books out there.  I think part of what I remember fondly is how actively involved my parents were when reading aloud to us.  They would articulate questions that came to their minds about what they were reading, we would look up words together if one of us asked what they meant, things like that. 




 Also a summary of this research was already posted today. 




 Bees don't actually make honey for their young, they make it for adult bee consumption during the winter.  They do produce substances to feed to larvae, including royal jelly, in glands inside their heads.

Otherwise, good question!  Some birds perform premastication, chewing up food and regurgitating it for babies.  Not sure if this is what you have in mind though. 









 I have used Yurbuds for the last couple of years for running, and I love them.  I don't use them for much else, which I think has helped preserve them.  They have kind of weird shape to fit into your ears, and it takes a few times to learn how to put them in, but I find them comfortable, they allow in some ambient noise so that you can stay aware of traffic, and I haven't had any issues with cord failure or corrosion.

I can't advise about devices, since I sync music to my shuffle, but you might try putting whatever you use into a snack-sized Ziplock bag.  I've carried my phone or a shuffle in the rain in a zipped bag, and they stayed dry. 




 Those are good points.

I guess I was trying to suggest either catch-and-release for bugs (with enough time in between those two to try to figure out what you've caught, maybe do some natural history observations on where it was found, what it does in the time when you have it, where you released it.)  Keeping a field journal of what neat stuff you see and catch would be great.  I don't see a need for a kid (as opposed to a taxonomist) to kill and pin insects when we can now pretty easily take a few fun pictures and then let them go.

For keeping and rearing, I was thinking mainly of insects, actually.  I guess a good rule is, keep something as long as you can care for it appropriately.  If you can find a Monarch caterpillar, rear it to emergence as a butterfly, and then release it, you might very well be doing the Monarch population a favor!  My family caught common frogs, toads, and a couple of garter snakes, and kept them happy and healthy for years.  Wild turtles, chipmunks, ducks, etc. are probably harder to care for, will be unhappy if confined, and are better off left in the wild.  But observing these guys from afar, IDing them with a field guide, making notes on their behavior, are all good science/natural history experience.

Figuring out this distinction, when is okay or not okay to touch, is also probably a good life lesson.

Killing animals is a reality of life and research . . . if you did want to start dealing with that idea, you could do an earthworm dissection.  There are also companies from which you can order a properly preserved fish or frog.  I would wait until an age where your daughter could do this kind of thing in a meaningful way, by identifying organs and relating their structure to what they do, making drawings of what she sees, so it's a respectful use of the animal. 




 "When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, you almost never make it. And even if you do it's a hollow victory. In order to sustain the victory you have to prove yourself again and again in some other way, and again and again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone will find out. That's never the way." *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* 




 Are Calvin and Hobbes in a wagon or sled at the top of a hill? 




 Insect collection gear; nothing fancy is really needed (mesh net, small plastic containers for collecting, a few mesh and/or plastic cages should all be pretty affordable.)  Some books to help ID insects and other animals.

Especially in a rural area, there should be lots of opportunities to catch and rear small critters.  A kid can learn a lot about science and responsibility by figuring out how to keep things alive for a few days or weeks.  There are also some neat citizen science projects out there where people report animals they've seen to help monitor threatened species. 




 Actually, there are some ways that epigenetic modifications can be examined via DNA sequence (eg, bisulfite sequencing), so this area might be an opportunity to make predictions more accurate in the future by providing a record of environmental influences, rather than making these efforts futile. 




 This is a really complex task; we are still in the process of learning what functions proteins perform, what genes code for those proteins, how variations in gene sequence and other DNA sequence affect gene expression and protein function, etc.

However, this is something that forensic scientists, geneticists, and others have been working on in humans and a few other animals, with some success: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129613.600-genetic-mugshot-recreates-faces-from-nothing-but-dna.html#.VZMA8kZdq2U

In agricultural research, researchers are also working on predicting certain traits of interest from DNA sequence alone, such as milk production in cows, yield or stress tolerance in crop plants, etc. 

Adding a bit of specificity after checking my facts.  Right now for humans, we can predict skin tone pretty well, and a few other traits with some accuracy (hair and eye color, hair texture, height, facial structure as above) but far from perfectly. As I said above, these areas are actively improving.  Reference: "Forensic DNA Phenotyping: Predicting human appearance from crime scene material for investigative purposes."

So, right now, probably not for most organisms, or sort of for humans.  In the future (10-20 years) probably much better, at least for humans and organisms "of interest". 




 That is the most fun sounding strength training I've ever heard of. 









 It might be a little harder with no affiliation.  Knowledge and ideas are always good currency in academia, though.  Enthusiasm alone might not be enough, but knowledgeable enthusiasm has a much better shot.

For the PIs you've identified, look up their prior published work on their websites or at the library, wherever you need to go to get access.  Read it and think about it.  Read some related work, or relate their work to what you already know from your undergraduate courses.  When you contact them, write a succinct first letter and not a show-offy one, but use your reading to articulate to them why you find their work interesting, and how you see your own intellectual interests and goals fitting with it.

If you have any good connections to faculty from your undergraduate institution, and still feel comfortable contacting them for advice, it might be worth letting them know of your current interests and what schools/PIs you are considering.  Even if they are in a different field, they might have some social connection to one or more of the people you're considering.  They might be able to give guidance on how to get in touch with those people. 




 One reason in addition to those already mentioned is the way that tendons attach muscle to bone.  Where the tendons interface with muscle and bone, there is usually not a clear boundary; there is a region where those two tissue types blend with each other in a complex way.

If the tendon tears away from the bone during injury, which happens really often when certain types of tendons are injured, this interface can't be healed back to the way it was.  The tendon can be re-attached surgically, but that complex interface can't be duplicated.  Instead of regrowing the original tendon, scar tissue forms in that area, which is less flexible and weaker than the original tissue.  This scar tissue is more likely to snap than to bear the same range of motion and force that the original tissue could stand.
