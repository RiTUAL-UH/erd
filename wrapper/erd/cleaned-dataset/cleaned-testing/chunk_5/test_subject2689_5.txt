 Though she'd been gone for several months, I still felt my wife's presence around me at all times. Perhaps I was imagining things. The loss of a loved one can have a weird effect on a person. Regardless of how much of a skeptic you were, you find yourself humoring thoughts you never would have considered before. You start seeing signs everywhere, no matter how small. It happened to me after my wife died. I believed she came back to comfort me in my time of need.

It started with little things: signs that could have easily been dismissed. I'd notice static on the radio, misplaced objects, chairs not pushed in all the way, etc. Some nights, I could even feel her crawling next to me in bed. These were all things that would make any sane person roll their eyes at you or give you a look of pity, like they know your grief is causing you to see what you want to see. Part of me understood that, but at the same time, I wanted so badly for my wife to be haunting me. I didn't have any concrete proof. That is, not until the night the dishes washed themselves.

My wife always hated doing the dishes. It was her least favorite chore. Most nights, I was the one who took care of washing up, though I often left the dishes overnight to soak. From time to time, my wife would surprise me by taking care of the job before I got home. I'd walk in to a squeaky clean counter and a little note with I love you written in a large heart. The small gesture always brought a smile to my face, and I made extra sure to repay my wife in kind.

One night, a few months after my wife passed, I walked through the front door. The house smelled like lime.

"I'm home!", I shouted.

It's hard to break the habit. To this day, I still greet her when I come home. As expected, there was no reply. I made my way to the dining room to drop off my things. That's when I spotted the dishes neatly stacked in their rightful places. There was a note on the counter with the same message my wife always left me. A flood of emotions washed over me. I was happy and sad at the same time. Holding the note to my face, I cried. There was no denying it now: my wife's spirit was watching over me.

It kept happening over the course of the next few weeks. Each time, the note would become damp with my tears. It was so comforting to feel close to my wife again.

One day, I had a nasty flu. I called in sick from work, and took some cold medicine to help me rest. It knocked me straight out, and I spent most of the day passed-out on my bed. By the time I awoke, I could hear clanging noises coming from the kitchen. My heart skipped a beat. I knew it had to be my wife's spirit. Still a little drowsy, I bounced out of bed and made a beeline for the kitchen, wondering if I would be able to talk to her. I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around her ethereal form and tell her how much I loved her. As I rounded the corner, I saw a solid figure in the kitchen.

It wasn't my wife.

"Who the fu-", I started, starring at the scene in shock.

An old man with a thick grey beard and tattered clothes turned towards me as I spoke. He yelped, dropping the bowl in his hands. Before I could even react, he bolted towards the front door and escaped, leaving me frozen in shock. I approached the counter, only to find my wife's note waiting there for me, heart and all. It had been him all along. The realization filled me with disgust, anger, and deep sorrow. It was like losing my wife all over again. I honestly thought she'd come back for me. I took so much comfort in knowing her spirit was with me, and that man had snuffed out all hope of reuniting with her.

The very same day, I had the locks changed. Whoever the man was, I wanted to make sure he'd never get inside my home again. 

This evening, I came home to find a note on the counter and dishes clean and stacked. I don't know how he's getting in, but it's scaring the shit out of meespecially since I'm over at my mom's house for the night. 




 xD 




 And that is exactly why I haven't read it yet. Waiting for a nice, quiet moment where I can read it all in one go. 




 I definitely want to read it when I get the chance. Everyone speaks so highly of it. 




 I haven't actually read it yet (shame on me!), but everyone constantly refers to [The Spire in the Woods] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nyt4a/the_spire_in_the_woods/) as being an amazing story, so I would say it counts as a classic. 




 Unless you're claiming the person in question is burning up a hugely-populated area, you should be OK. 




 It kind of depends on what you mean by "somewhat believable".

I.e. Chicago was obliterated by an unknown military presence. It's believable in the sense that it *could* happen, but it wouldn't work on NoSleep because, well, obviously Chicago is fine.

My cat turned into a parrot and started pecking my parent's eyes out. Not super-believeable, but it only affects you and your little nucleus, so who's to say it didn't actually happen. That premise would, in theory, be OK. 




 I think the problem is that twists have turned into a gimmickwhen the intention is really just to end a story with a bang. Kind of how horror movies always have the psychokiller stand up right before the credits roll.


If done right, they'll leave the reader wanting more. Problem is that a lot of those twists are reused constantly.


PSYCH. I AM A PINEAPPLE. I WAS A PINEAPPLE ALL ALONG. You thought I was a person?! NOPE. YOU JUST GOT THE OPINION OF A TROPICAL FRUIT. 




 *Scratch scratch scratch* 




 Y'know, I was afraid that would make the twist too obvious. Looking at it now, it really doesn't. Saying "his" could be taken both ways.

*Edited because of the typo demons. 




 It should only frighten you if you have something negative to say which isn't constructive criticism. Otherwise, the person who is secretly the writer will probably just think it's funny. After all, who wouldn't want to know someone else is talking about their story? 




 I think it looks really cool. Kudos to you, o labyrinth-dweller. 




 I know someone who can take care of that for ya. :) 




 It's a little-known fact that the act of scratching releases dopamine into your system. This means that every time you scratch an itch, you're not just relieving a discomfort: you're making yourself feel better. It's no surprise, then, that some people can take it a little too far.

 nbsp;

Craig had an awful itch that needed to be scratched. His short fingernails desperately dug along flesh, hoping to alleviate the horrid sensation tinkling inside of him.

 nbsp;

*Scratch scratch scratch.*

 nbsp;

Aaaah, it felt so good.

 nbsp;

*Scratch scratch scratch.*

 nbsp;

He broke the skin. Blood began to trickle out, but his fingers had not yet reached the spot nagging him.

 nbsp;

*Scratch scratch scratch.*

 nbsp;

Dopamine seeped into his system, filling him with a pleasant sense of relief, though not enough to stop him quite yet.

 nbsp;

*Scratch scratch scratch.*

 nbsp;

No, he couldn't stop, not even after he made it through all layers of skin, and to the muscle tissue: the itch ran deeper.

 nbsp;

*Scratch scratch scratch.*

 nbsp;

He could see something white just outside of his reach. There was no going back now. The itch was so strong. He needed to scratch that white form hiding under the muscles.

 nbsp;

*Scratch scratch scratch.*

 nbsp;

His fingertips finally reached the femur's bony surface. The itch was gone, and Craig let out a sigh of relief. It felt so good. He had all the pleasure of scratching an itch, without any of the pain.

 nbsp;

Just as Craig thought he was finally done, he felt another itch right behind the eye. His bound victim thrashed and screamed in panic as Craig's bloody finger approached his face. He couldn't help it: it was an itch he needed scratching. 




 My grandma died when I was quite young. Though I was in preschool when she passed, I still distinctively remember the summers spent at her home. When I was sick, she'd sit me on her lap and sing me a peaceful lullaby. When it got too hot, we'd make fresh lemonade. On cloudless nights, we'd sneak out of the house and sit by the creek that ran through the property, looking down at the Milky Ways reflection in the water's surface. We'd spend hours by the creek, day and night, dipping our feet and watching the fish swim by. Grandma loved that creek, as well as the forest beyond its south bank.

 nbsp;

Visiting my grandparents' home in the country was the highlight of my summer, which is why I was so upset the year my parents didn't take me. I didn't understand it back then: my parents, not wanting to traumatize me, simply told me my grandma had gone away. My first thought was that I had done something wrong to make grandma leave. Bawling my eyes out, I tugged on my mom's shirt, promising I'd be a good little girl, and begged her to take me to grandma. She hugged me tightly, ran a hand through my hair, and told me it wasnt my fault.

 nbsp;

The next summer, I returned to my grandparents' rural home for a memorial service. It was only when I saw the modest tombstone that I realized grandma wasn't coming back. By then, I had somewhat grasped the concept of death, albeit in childlike fashion: grandma was in heaven, living in the clouds. I asked my mom if we could plant a tree in grandma's memory. I pictured that tree growing and growing, bean stock-style, until it reached the sky itself. I would climb it, and reunite with her. My mother turned to grandpa.

 nbsp;

"What do you think, dad?", she asked.

 nbsp;

Grandma had always wanted to be buried on the very property where she grew up. After she died, it seemed only fitting to lay her to rest by the creek that she loved so dearly. We couldn't exactly plant a tree in the yard without grandpa's approval. Fortunately, my grandfather's solemn frown turned into a broad smile. He knelt down in front of me, and placed a hand on my shoulder.

 nbsp;

"I think that's a wonderful idea, honey. What kind of tree should we plant?", replied grandpa.

 nbsp;

I knew exactly what grandma would have wanted. Of all the trees lining the forest on the other side of the creek, there was one she loved most of all. Without missing a beat, I answered.

 nbsp;

"A willow tree!", I chirped excitedly.

 nbsp;

I'm not sure whether we went to the tree nursery that same day, or a few weeks later, but we eventually purchased a willow sprout. We made a big celebration out of it. Grandpa let me break ground with a tiny plastic shovel, while mom and dad prepared a picnic. We sat under or rather, next to the twig-sized tree, and shared stories about grandma all afternoon.

 nbsp;

"You picked a good, strong willow. Grandma would be proud.", grandpa whispered to me, as we were packing up.

 nbsp;

I was overjoyed that I had not only contributed something useful, but that I had planted the tree that would eventually let me see grandma again. I couldn't wait for it to grow taller than the stars in the sky.

 nbsp;

Year after year, I returned to the countryside to spend time with my grandpa. I watched as my willow tree grew bigger, never forgetting my secret plan. Now, I'm not sure how long a willow tree usually takes to grow, but I remember being impressed every time I visited: it always seemed much taller than when I had last seen it. In the span of about five years, it blossomed from a measly little sprout, to a glorious full-sized tree. On stormy nights, I could hear the wind blowing through its growing branches, producing an otherworldly howl. It was the sweetest sound I had ever heard, bringing pleasant chills to my core. It was the kind of "creepy" sound that one would normally be afraid of, but not me. No, I loved it. I wished for wind and storms so I could hear the haunting weeps of my willow tree.

 nbsp;

A few years ago, my grandfather died of heart failure. His house and property went to my mother. My parents, being city folk themselves, didn't fancy moving away to the countryside. When they offered me the home, I gleefully accepted. The commute to work was long, but the peace and tranquility made it well worth my time. I loved to sit on the patio to watch storms on the horizon, take walks in the valley, and sit under my willow tree that guarded grandmas grave by the splendid creek.

 nbsp;

My favorite time of year was Autumn, when the world turned burgundy and orange. My willow tree stood out from the rest of the landscape, its leafs turning into yellowish shades that reminded me of hay. The crisp October air felt refreshing after the long, humid summer, and Fall showers were a welcomed relief from hours of watering the plants outside my home. Autumn felt like a new beginning, like someone repainting an old canvas to breathe life into it.

 nbsp;

One evening, I decided to bake a traditional apple pie in the rustic wood-burning oven. The sky had turned black in anticipation of another storm. Leafs were flying around all over the place and wind howled at my window like a siren call for weary sailors. A loose branch snapped against the side of the house, drawing my attention outside. I noticed a hooded man limping his way towards my home. Stumbling, he made his way to my front porch. I opened the door.

 nbsp;

"Are you okay, sir?", I asked, in a concerned tone of voice.

 nbsp;

"C-can Iccome inside?", he requested weakly.

 nbsp;

I nodded and beckoned him in. The man, using the outer wall for support, slowly made his way towards me. He looked in very poor shape, and I decided I'd offer him a slice of pie and a place to sleep. It didn't come to that, however. As soon as he walked through the threshold, the man's hand shot up, and he grabbed my ponytail. I could see blood along his bony arms. I wasnt sure whether it was his or someone elses. With his other hand, he gripped my arm so tightly that it left finger-shaped bruises. He yanked me outside, into the cold night air. I started screaming like a banshee, but on such a windy night, there was no way anyone would hear me. Besides, I was miles away from another soul.

 nbsp;

No matter how hard I fought, I couldn't break free from the stranger. Adrenaline flooded my veins, and I hoped that it would be enough to shift the balance of power back in my favor. Alas, no matter how much I kicked and punched, the stranger was stronger than I was. He dragged me all the way to my willow tree, like a barbaric cave man. He pushed me against its trunk, pinning me to it.

 nbsp;

"TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES!", he screamed at me.

 nbsp;

Sobbing profusely, I defiantly shook my head. When I refused, he struck me hard on the cheek with one hand, and ripped my skirt with the other. A gust of wind blew his hood back, but my eyes were so full of tears that I could not make out his features. Fearing for my life, I shakily began undoing my shirt. My fingertips felt numb, and I could barely manage to undo the first button on my blouse. I must have taken too long, because the man growled angrily, and reared his arm up for another slap. My cheek was still stinging from the first blow. I winced, shut my eyes tightly, and braced myself for a second hit.

 nbsp;

*CRACK! THUD!*

 nbsp;

I shrieked as I heard the sound, and it took me a few moments to figure out that I had been spared. Opening my eyes, I found the man at my feet, with a large laceration along his temple. Blood gushed out of him at a sickeningly quick pace. I looked around, trying to get my bearings.

 nbsp;

A heavy gust sent a large broken branch rolling towards me. There was something unnatural about its shape: it was thick on one end, ballooned in the middle, and narrowed back down at the other end. It looked like a snake that had just swallowed its prey. With the tip of my foot, I turned it over. There, I saw a fossilized skull encased under a layer of bark. My attackers blood could be seen along its rock-hard jawline.

 nbsp;

The roots of the willow tree, seeking the nearest source of water, had eaten my grandma, which rested between it and the creek. In the end, I got the reunion I so desperately wanted. Wind howled once more through the branches, and I finally recognized the lullaby that grandma used to sing to me. 




 Way to go Suspense!! I am throwing virtual confetti your way. : D 




 They ask permission first, and link to our social media sites. Don't worry, there's nothing shady going on. 




 I hit the "New" tab and check out a couple of recently-uploaded stories. I also check out what my favorite authors and/or buddies have posted and read those.





But I mostly like to listen to the narrations... 




 A poster of kittens above the bed should do the trick.

Except, you might wake up one night and their evil little eyes will be leering over you. Wuahahahaha. 




 I, for one, try to include a Rodriguez Jackson Lemieux in every single one of my stories. 




 As a wise person once said: "Write what you know."

I think having stories from other parts of the world would be awesome. I definitely look forward to reading yours. : ) It could also be refreshing since different cultures have differing views on horror. 




 Guess you...*reap* what you sew. HAHAHAHAHA.

Loved the story. 




 PLEASE DON'T HURT ME HERE HAVE A CARROT. 




 It's not the comments that require a 10 minute wait time, it's the posts. I.e. If you post a story on NoSleep, and immediately head over to ShowerThoughts to post something there, the system will refuse it. It's not a NoSleep thing, it's a Reddit thing.

(Also: if someone else in your home has an account and posts something, you'll have to wait 10 minutes before you can post yours, if you're connected using the same router.) 




 It was replaced by a gladiator-style battle this month. I'm not goin' to spoil it for ya, but I will say Grind is one ferocious contender. I still have tooth marks. 




 For years, I've been workin' at a pawnshop in a seedy part of town. I see all types of weirdoes here: peeping toms, drug addicts, wannabe thugs, and even known criminals. It's not hard to tell who's sellin' stolen shit to make a quick buck, but it aint my place to judge. No, I just buy an sell. Technically, I gotta hold new inventory for a month before sellin' it, in case stuff gets reported stolen. Let the cops sort through that shit, though: I've never seen one brave nough to come round these parts anyways.

 nbsp;

Ted, my favorite customer, was different from the usual scumbags. Cleanly groomed, sharply-dressed, and polite, he was the polar opposite of the trash that usually came through the squeaky alleyway door.

 nbsp;

First time he visited, he looked frazzled, and I thought was gonna piss himself in fear. I assumed he was some tourist who took a wrong turn or somethin'. In actuality, he was doin' the pawnshop circuit around town, tryin' to find rare daggers and swords. I sold him a couple nice pieces, an he rewarded me with an unexpected tip.

 nbsp;

Ted returned every couple of weeks. He'd sharpen those daggers and to buy a few new ones. I was surprised by how fast he kept dullin' his blades. Figured he was practicin' on fruit or wood. One day, I asked him about it, fully expectin' he'd give me a lame-ass answer, like he roleplayed as a ninja or somethin'. Ted looked me dead in the eyes, and, without a hint of deceit or emotion, answered:

 nbsp;

"Nothing dulls a blade faster than human flesh." 




 That's just the way I like it. 




 You're only as happy as your saddest mod, so keep your mods happy by being nice and polite to them, because they work very hard. 




 needed to enjoy eachandeverybyte.

I took far more enjoyment out of that pun than I probably should have.

Creepy story, man. 




 I never wanted to be "that guy". You know, the controlling, overbearing, and crazy jealous dude who always worries his girl's going to cheat on him? You see them on talk shows admitting to installing tracking software on their girlfriends' phones, following them around town, and isolating them from their friends and families. I didn't think I had it in me: I'm a nice, normal guy. Shana; however, brought out a bad side of me. I don't know what it was about her. She was special. She was the love of my life, and I could see myself settling down with her. At the same time, I was so paranoid that she'd cheat and leave me, that I tookdrastic measures. To put it simply, I invented a twin brother, and I had him seduce her. I mean, if she was going to cheat on me, it might as well be with me, right?

 nbsp;

Shana and I met at a pub about half a year ago. When I saw her across the room, I swear I could almost hear a choir of angels singing above her. A pick-up line at the ready, I shyly walked over to introduce myself. Her smile temporarily made me forget how to speak, and I barely managed to produce a squawking sound. She laughed lightly, making my anxiety wash away like chalk in the rain. We talked for a bit, exchanged numbers, and eventually went on a few dates. Shana was perfect: sexy, sweet, loving, ambitious, and spunky.

 nbsp;

It wasn't long before Shana moved in with me. I think that's when things started taking a turn for the worst. It was fine for the first couple of days, until I started noticing her flirting with other men behind my back, and coming home late almost every night. Every time she allegedly had to work late, I was left pacing up and down our apartment, imagining her canoodling some scumbag. I sometimes drove by her work, but I never had the balls to go in and confirm my suspicions.

 nbsp;

Eventually, I decided to sit Shana down and have a long, serious talk. And by that, I mean I fabricated an elaborate lie. I told her about my twin brother, Eric. Naturally she wanted to know why I hadn't told her about him before. Faking tears, I explained that he'd been in and out of jail. She seemed to like bad boys, so I knew that'd spark her interest. I told her a sob story about how my mom had cut him out of our family photos, how everyone thought he was a bad egg, and how I wanted to protect her from him. She consoled me, but I could see a twinkle of excitement in her eyes. My trap was set.

 nbsp;

One night, I put on a leather jacket, applied hair gel, and went out searching for Shana. I "coincidentally" bumped into her at the park where she liked to jog. I puffed my chest out proudly, taking on Eric's confident stance, and half-heartedly apologized for ramming into her. Using a slightly deeper voice and different mannerisms, I acted as though we had never met. She lit up, immediately guessing that I was my made-up twin brother. She seemed to like how bold and fearless Eric was, so I put the moves on her right then and there. She fell head over heels for me. With that, she and 'Eric' started dating in secret.

 nbsp;

Eric was the kind of guy that I had always wanted to be: slick, smooth, and assertive. He was an adrenaline junkie, and never afraid to speak his mind. He wore clothes I'd never be caught dead in: plenty of leather, tight t-shirts, rocker bracelets. He was a living, breathing stereotype, and playing his role made me feel alive. I was a quiet guy who liked to stay at home and read, but he liked to party and do crazy shit.

 nbsp;

I discovered a new side of Shana thanks to Eric, and fell in love with her all over again. It was funny to see how different our regular dates were compared to the ones with Eric. Shana was more adventurous and exciting than I could have ever imagined. As Eric, we did awesome stuff together: we went skydiving, we rented motorcycles, we went to concerts, and we tried a bunch of kinky stuff in bed.

 nbsp;

Knowing I was satisfying both Shana's sense of adventure, and her quieter, intellectual side, I was finally able to let go of my worries and paranoia. I had Shana all to myself, and it was fantastic. Life was great, and I bought a ring so I could propose to her on our anniversary this weekend. She'd probably break things off with Eric once we got engaged, so I made a commitment to myself to try and be a little more like Eric from now on.

 nbsp;

Last night, all my plans went up in smoke. Shana was working late, but she and Eric didn't have a date scheduled, so I assumed she was actually working for once. It was nice out, so I decided to pass the time by taking a nice little stroll around town. As I walked by the large windows of a quaint Italian restaurant, my world came crashing down around me: Shana was playing tonsil-hockey with another man. I watched from the street as the dark-haired stranger ran his hands up and down her back. A mix of despair and anger twirled around in my gut. Had I not been enough for her? Had Eric not been enough?! I had given her everything she could have wanted. What she couldn't do with me, she did with Eric. There was no reason for her to go outside our relationships. I had invested so much time, and STILL she was cheating on me. But that wasn't even the most disturbing part

 nbsp;

The man's eyes turned towards me as he was making out with my girl. Shana, who had her back to the window, was obscuring his face. Very slowly, he pulled away from my woman, and tilted his head towards me. A devious smirk stretched over his lips as he looked towards me. His cold and amused eyes were proclaiming victory over me. I felt my knees buckle at the incomprehensible sight before me: it was Eric. 




 Just don't tap on our windows. We writers are an easily startled breed. 




 If you're on a Mac, you can hit **ctrl-option-command 8** to invert colors. (And again to switch back.) The comments will be readable, too.


I don't know of any quick shortcuts to do it on a Windows PC, though. You kind of have to go the long way and mess with the accessibility settings. Might just want to download an add-on to your browser that lets you do it. 




 I take comments with a grain of salt. I've seen a few disturbing ones on my stories, but I just shrug them off. Some people are just trying to be funny and are hoping their comments will get them upvotes. Others just want to say something disturbing for the shits and giggles. Don't worry too much about it. 




 You can post in the third person, as long as there's a reason why the protagonist isn't the one telling the story. For example, a coworker retelling an account of what happened to his colleague prior to his death, or someone sharing a story their grandparents have told them.

 Keep up the awesome work, Yara. I enjoy your narrations very much! : ) 




 Even if you write the most original thought on the planet, someone's going to find something to compare it to. Write from your heart (or fingertips, whichever works best) and you're good to go.

Also: WELCOME TO THE FAMILY. :D 




 You have to have three lines between each paragraph, and insert the code for non-breaking spaces (as identified in your comment) in the middle line. That should work.

(I don't believe it works in the comment section, though.) 




 Like the others said, the limit is 40 000 characters.

While there's no magic formula for post length, I've personally found that an average of 1 500 words is fairly good. It's long enough to tell a story, but not so long that you get a bunch of people groaning "tl;dr" at you.

If you're breaking your story down into multiple parts, make sure your parts are about the same length, otherwise it may get flagged and deleted. 




 Holy pepperoni pizza! That looks like some kind of swamp monster. Creepy! 




 You mean to tell me you DON'T have a festive, winter-specific tie?! 




 It was all me, then. ; D 




 My evil twin brother wrote that line..? : ) 




 On the side, near the stomach area. Of course the dress covered her up. I didn't want that disgusting thing showing. 




 I always post from the same account. There's no rule against it. 




 It was supposed to be **my** special day. Everything was going to be perfect. Preparations were made, a hotel conference room was reserved, and hundreds of my Facebook followers were invited. I'd even gotten a custom-made dress for the occasion. Everything was going off without a hitch, but then, my sister ruined my life.

 nbsp;

It started during the father-daughter dance. There we were, gliding across the ballroom like ice skaters. All eyes were on me, as my beautiful gown fluttered at my feet. Suddenly, my sister started shrieking. Dad obviously hadn't medicated her enough. While everyone tried to figure out what had made the noise, the attention whore tore a hole in the side of my dress with her bare teeth. I felt a sharp pain as she convulsed and thrashed. Had she somehow bitten me!?

 nbsp;

My party guests were on-edge, all because of that selfish little bitch. She couldn't even let me have ONE freaking day to myself. She then started foaming at the mouth and mumbling incoherently. What a freaking drama queen! Her disgusting sausage-like fingers grabbed a glass off a nearby table and threw it at the crowd.

 nbsp;

By then, my friends were running scared. They shrieked in horror, drowning out the unholy noises coming from my sister's deformed mouth. A disgusting green liquid came gushing out of her lips, staining my beautiful golden dress.

 nbsp;

Once the party was officially ruined, her head dropped, she went quiet, and turned blue.

 nbsp;

I'm going in for surgery tomorrow to have her remains removed from my side before she starts to putrefy. I've been carrying around her useless malformed half-body 16 years too long. 




 I'm not sure...was yours covered in sacrificial blood..? 




 Naturally! It'd be a crime not to. 




 That's OK. Last year, I bought the entire series on DVD and watched all 52 episodes of it in a single week. 




 Hahaha that made my day!

 "I DON'T CARE IF THE STUPID COUPON EXPIRED. I WANT MY 25 CENTS OFF!!!", shouted a wrinkly old hag.

 nbsp;

Craig glanced over at a fellow cashier for some much-needed sympathy. He'd been dealing with unruly customers all day, and this lady was no exception. Why she was making a fuss about a box of cereal was beyond him.

 nbsp;

"Mam, we can't accept an expired coupon...", he tried to explain, sounding desperate.

 nbsp;

His hands were tied. He'd been told by the managers that he'd be fired if he accepted invalid coupons. His boss was strict, and, like the customers, showered him with verbal abuse if he caved into their demands. Still, after another ten minutes passed with the customer howling like a banshee, he had to call for a manager to handle the situation.

 nbsp;

The big boss came down from his comfortable office overlooking the rows of cash registers. He put on a big, fake smile as he approached the customer. He apologized to her and offered to not only accept the coupon, but give her the product for free. He did this all the time, just to make the cashiers look like the bad guys, while he walked off as a hero.

Suddenly, Craig felt something on his shoulder. The customer faded away, and he found himself on the other side of the counter, holding an expired coupon. His throat was coarse, as though he'd been yelling, and his hands were balled into fists. The cashier, Theodore, smiled.

"Thank you for shopping at Food Mart. Have a wonderful day.", he said, hoping Craig had learned his lesson. 




 Well I know the words, but I can't really speak them to you. 




 Well, fiddlesticks and fudgesicles! 




 Oh my gosh. That's pretty much the best idea ever. 




 This is *math* we're talking about. I'm going to need stick figures drawn by sharpie on a whiteboard to understand. 




 I try to, but I find myself horrendous at explaining my stories out loud, and end up stumbling over my words and making them sound like the lamest thing ever. So now, I just tell my loved ones once I post stuff and give 'em a link. 




 Say what..? 




 Maybe it should be a Writing Prompt. HA. 




 In life, everything ebbs and flows. What's popular today won't be in a few months.

I wasn't around back when NoSleep first started, but I have been making my way through the NoSleep Podcast archives, listening to the stories from 'back then'. From what I can tell, even today, there are wonderful stories crafted by incredibly talented writers.

Things will keep changing, but there will always be great quality stories for people to read. Whether they're long series or shorter posts...they make people happy, and that's what counts the most in my book. 




 ...damn. 




 Darn. Maybe I'll have to take a crack at it. 




 I hope you write it...and I hope it goes viral.

 Crud. Why didn't I think of that? 




 People are thrilled that spring is just around the corner. My colleagues are already shedding their coats, removing their winter tires, and talking about the day where theyll finally be able to wear shorts and sandals. Some are buying seeds for their gardens, others are making summer plans to visit the cottage. The days are getting longer as the sun coats the north hemisphere with warm rays of light. Its only normal for people to be happy.

 nbsp;

Not me, though. I hate spring. I hate it with every fibre of my being. You could even say that I'm terrified of it. Thats because I know the truth: I know whats hiding in the snow banks. I know what will happen when they thaw. Every day, they get lower and lower. The snow melts and streams of water leak into the street like blood from an open wound. In my nightmares, I can see dozens of hands reaching out from their snowy graves. I can imagine the agonized looks on their bluish faces. My heart pounds hard against my chest every time I walk by a snow bank, and I wonder how many of them are hidden within.

 nbsp;

As birds begin their migration home, I grow ever more anxious. I lay awake at night, thinking about what will happen when they find the bodies. I just hope I didn't leave any evidence behind. 




 Awesome!
