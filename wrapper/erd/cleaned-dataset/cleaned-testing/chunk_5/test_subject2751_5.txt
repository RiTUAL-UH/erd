 I really enjoyed this game up until the last few rounds. Then it's a repetitive motion to bash the leader because players may only win at the beginning of their turn, not the end. This draws out an extra 30 minutes. Obviously this matters less in a 2 player game.

If it wasn't for this mechanic for game end, I'm pretty sure it would be a top-250 game on bgg. 




 Pretty solid week for me:

**Roll for the Galaxy** - really enjoyed this. It flows much smoother than Race for the Galaxy as you don't need to stare at your hand often to decide which cards to keep and which to play.

**Spyfall** - quite fun after you know the majority of the available locations. Love it when people come up with creative questions.

**Witness** - mildly amusing light logic game that takes 10 minutes. 

**Cyclades** - very cool bidding+area control game that becomes intense in the last few rounds of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this.

**Lords of Xidit** - I really wanted to enjoy this more but I just can't stand it when people are AP over a simple game.

**Orleans** - my second play. Still enjoyed this but I have a feeling every time the ending of the game would be the same.

**Brass** - messed up some rules in the beginning but we eventually got it right. Very brain-burning but satisfying at the same time. Came close second, if only I chose the right railroads to build, argh! 




 Most games do it by dice. Some games, e.g. **Impulse**, resolves battles by flipping the top cards on the deck.  




 Games where 

1. Players are rewarded for planning ahead (**Terra Mystica**, **Agricola**)

2. Information is mostly open - even if you get backstabbed or blocked by other players, it should be foreseeable.

3. Replayable. Mostly comes with randomised setup.  

4. No randomised outcome generator, so every immediate outcome from a decision should be mostly predictable.

5. Feeling of progress within a game. You start out slow on resources and abilities, but you get multiple upgrades during the game.

Basically, I like a game if on my way home I think to myself, damn I should have done this and this instead of that, I was such an idiot!  




 This is neat! Instead of tracking total points, wouldn't it make more sense to score by average position? 




 Did you play in a pub in London? If yes I probably played with you and it was a great game!
In my game I was the first to build a metropolis but then spent way too much money and effort defending it, eventually losing my second island. I will try to be sneakier next time. 




 **Galaxy Trucker** - 1st half of the game: build your own spaceship in a limited time by grabbing tiles. 2nd half of the game: travel through space, getting hit by meteors, fighting off aliens, transporting goods for $. It's pretty light, chaotic, and fun. However, unlike FTL, you don't get to make too many decisions in battles/upgrading ships/recruiting crew. 




 Don't think of it as food production. Think of it as a discount for feeding at the end of each round until the end of the game. 




 I go to London on Board too, and I find that it's easier to bond with gamers with similar tastes than convert a friend to a gamer.  I prefer playing with gamers for several reasons:

1. Personal preference for games. Some interactive games (e.g. **Avalon**) probably work better when you play with friends and I'm personally not a big fan of those.

2. More opportunities to try out new games when playing with a group of gamers.

3. More opportunities to play at a competitive level (e.g. tournaments) with a group of gamers. 




 They are all great choices based on your criteria. 

**Glory to Rome** is an excellent game, but I highly doubt you can find a copy for less than $25.

I'm certain you'll enjoy **Race for the Galaxy** and **Star Realms** as you liked **San Juan** and **Dominion**. Just be aware that you directly attack each other in **Star Realms** in case that's an issue. Also, you can try out **Race for the Galaxy** for free on boardgamearena first. 




 Let's give this a go!

 I'm not sure whether it's worth it to back the kickstarted version and wait 8 months, or just buy a copy now. 

Speaking from my own experience, you will like the game if you enjoy:  
1. Pool and engine building; a main difference from other "pool-builders" is that you start off by drawing 4 tokens each round, but this ability could be upgraded to a max of 8.  
2. Indirect conflict only (race on the map, buying a building someone else wants, buying the last token etc);  
3. Feld games, i.e. not thematic, multiple ways to get victory points; and  
4. Games that are not too unforgiving. Had a bad draw? You can place say, one token to a building that requires 2 tokens. You don't activate the building this turn, but it increases your chances to fill in the remaining token later for a big turn later on.
 




 Awesome week! Tried some new games:

**Sheriff of Nottingham** - A game about smuggling goods, detecting lies, and making deals. This has become my favourite bluffing + negotiation game! There's even some euro-y elements to it. Best to play with friends.

**Archipelago** - A semi-cooperative resource management game with a brilliant market system. The 4 newbies (including me of course) were really selfish and didn't care about resolving crisis on round 3....so the rebel counter jumped from 4 to 34. The host of the game (traitor) won by the end of round 4. 

**Imperial Settlers** - I enjoyed the engine building and chain combo bits of the game but was slightly disappointed as I didn't think it lived up to its hype. First half of the game is very non-interactive. Then near the end it felt like the winner just goes to whoever was lucky enough to draw the most over powered cards from the faction deck.

**Orleans** - I had a blast playing this new bag building Euro! Everything starts out slow (1-2 actions in a round) then with careful planning you'll be getting 3-4 actions and it felt so satisfying.  Definitely hoping to play this more.

Games I've played before: **Terra Mystica**, **Mage Knight**, **Splendor** x3, **Galaxy Trucker**, **Biblios** 




 Probably not a common gripe but only my own for **Lords of Waterdeep**. I find the initial 2 quests+lords randomly dealt to a player involving too much luck. I usually go with card drafting for the initial 2 quests, then deal 2 keep 1 for lords. 




 **Splendor**. It takes about 30 seconds to setup, and 1 minute to learn the rules. Note that it is almost an abstract game with minimal social interaction, which is very different from the games that you currently play. 




 **Ingenious** is quite similar to Quirkle. Most of Knizia's games are abstract math games, examples include **Ra**, **Lost Cities** and **Kingdoms**. 




 Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards you for specialising, so focus on one-two main scoring elements. Also, remember to use rubies at the right time, e.g. getting a tunnel before building a mine/animal right before breeding/using a high level dwarf etc. Sometimes it even takes opponents by surprise.

Not sure about the balance in weapons in a 3p game, as you said, it's powerful if only one does it. If two do it, the other person can easily build a strong farm+animal engine very easily. It's usually well balanced in a 4p game.
