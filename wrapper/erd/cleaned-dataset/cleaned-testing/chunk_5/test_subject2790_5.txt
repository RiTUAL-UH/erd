 I headcanon that as First Enchanter he's always been able to perform blood magic but never done so publicly because of the (justifiable) stigma around it. By enabling Quentin he had an outlet for these practices until he hit that point at the end of the game where he saw no way out. Not defending him though because it was really messed up, and further justifies everyone's concerns about mages. 




 Are you talking about the POP figures? Because looking at your link those are Fallout 3 figurines. 

Am I missing something? 




 This manager is still in charge of our TripAdvisor page, every reply is littered with errors like this. IMHO it makes us look really unprofessional but the higher ups don't care so she's left to it. 




 Your/You're 

One of the managers at my work was tasked with our advertising for Mother's Day (UK) and displayed signs all around the pub about "treating you're mum to a Mother's Day meal." I cringed so hard the two weeks they were up. I have a problem with this sort of thing. 




 Omg yes! I'm currently at uni and have just started bringing my laptop in to take notes as it is too awkward to write anything by hand. 




 Not had slap on the ass but something similar. I work as a waitress/barmaid and this particular night was on the bar. The pub was quite quiet at this point so I was chatting to some punters. Bear in mind I'm 25 and these guys were easily in their late 40's. 

So one of the guys asks to buy me a drink, I said no as I was working but if I saw him in the pub when I was off I'd remind him. I then promised "hand on heart" that this would happen, while placing my hand over my chest. He took this as an opportunity to lean over the bar and make a grab for my chest "just to check (I) even had a heart." I leapt back and laughed it off, told him he'd just have to take my word for it and went back to work. I told my manager later what had happened and he told me to let him know if anything like that happens again.
