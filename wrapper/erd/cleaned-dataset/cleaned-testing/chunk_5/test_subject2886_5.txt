 That is very true. And I bet everyone who thinks they were raised well will find things wrong with the way other people were raised. I guess it's just the apparent reliance on technology that scares me. I feel that I was raised very well, and hope to raise my future children the same way, but I think it's pretty hard to royally screw up a child, so long as you still treat them like a human being. 




 Up vote for cats with human names. Mine are Kate and Bill, next girl (unless a ginger, who will be named after one of the Weasley ladies) will be Tallulah, three L's and an H. 




 We've had our fair share of ferals back home, he looks like he can take care of himself. Hopefully he can get into a TNR program, but he looks like he's seen some shit. 




 At older ages, it's ok, but I've seen many people hand an iPad to their two year old because they didn't want to deal with actual parenting.

Then again, I may be old school. I wasn't allowed to play video games at all growing up (I played Mario kart for the first time when I was 18), and that probably skewed my views. If I ever uttered the words "I'm bored," I was immediately put to work cleaning or working in the garden. Hell, I spent every summer from age 7 to 15 at a garden camp, and it was amazing until I was put in a junior counselor position (for some reason, everyone assumes girls love small children, who I happen to hate more than most things). 




 I'm terrified when I see parents these days just give their kids a smartphone to be entertained. I ran around in the yard, wrestled with the dogs, read books, asked my dad if I could help cook, and did all sorts of fun things that stimulated me more than candy crush ever could.

Then again, I was homeschooled 2nd-6th grade, and did ballet, so there was always a science project or a new step to practice, too. 




 Idk about German, but gendered nouns often don't make any sense. In French, the word for vagina is masculine. 




 Wine glasses, IME, are just for breaking on your kitchen floor. Lost my last one a month ago, and my vacuum is so shitty that I still get to pick pieces of broken glass out of my feet afye lunch every day. 




 That glass thing hasn't had an atm for at least a year. 




 In my experience, old animals know when it's time and will wander, as if to keep the ones who love them from seeing the body. We had a Cocker Spaniel growing up, and right around his 17th birthday, he just wandered off and we never saw him again. That was actually a lot easier for me (I was 13/14) than when we put down our other dog when I was 16. Cody the spaniel was my sister's dog, Buddha was my baby brother (he was only a year younger than me).

I already get very sad thinking about the day I will need to put my cats down, but they are both young still. 




 I've been wanting to get friends to go to brunch, cuz there's a place in town that has cheap mimosa pitchers, but no one is awake. 




 I've only met a couple niche celebrities (Julie Kent would occasionally visit my ballet studio growing up, a family friend has juggled for Cirque de Soleil, and anyone who grows up in Bloomington, Indiana has at least seen John Mellencamp [ps, he's a jerk]), but even those I've had a hard time keeping it together.

It's good to hear about famous people acting like what they are -- regular people who happen to be famous. And good on you for treating him as that, besides the photo op that must get annoying. 




 There's this store in San Francisco that literally only has infused oils, vinegar, and spices. I got a bottle of salad dressing that was lemon evoo and chili-fig balsamic last time I was out there. One of the best things I've ever tasted. 




 I went with Dead Poets Society, which if course made me sob anyway, but his first scene. "We are food for worms, lads. One day, we are all going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die." That bluntness has helped me through the hard times, oddly. 




 He may go to a new home at some point, because my dad is allergic and barely tolerates the one who adopted us several years ago, but I hope this little Nugget can stay around. I'd take him in, but my landlord is already iffy about me having two. 




 Thanks do the quick reply! I will probably just go to the drugstore to get a cheap pair of nylons for stuffing, cuz I want it to be overstuffed, and will be using scrap yarn, so will probably need to use dc or hdc to make sure I have enough. 









 I've decided to take a short break from my frantic afghan making (3.5 left to do before Xmas, at least two before graduation in May) to make myself a foot cushion.

I have terrible knees and ankles (seeing an orthopedist in a month or so to find out what's really wrong), and when I spend a day working on a project, it's those joints that hurt more than my wrists.

I'm just gonna wing the pattern, but I've never made anything stuffed before. Do I need to make sure that the stitch are especially tight so the filling won't leak out? Could I stuff it in some pantyhose and then into the pillow? One of my cats is notorious for ripping the stuffing out of any toy and trying to eat it, so I'd like to find a way to minimize that.

TL;DR: making my first stuffed object, how can I make sure the stuffing will stay inside? 




 This is terrifying! I finally finished a blanket for a friend that was supposed to be done for graduation (early May), so I'm gonna have to ship it from Indiana to Seattle/Tacoma when she moves out there in a week or so, and I was planning on using one of those USPS flat rate boxes. I guess I'll wait to buy the yarn for my next project so I can ship it with UPS or FedEx and feel more secure. 




 Is there any type of shelter? My town has a battered women's shelter,  and every year I use my Christmas scraps to make hats and scarves do the kids who live there.

Many animal shelters will also accept blankets and cat baskets. Look up the snuggles project. 




 I understand this in posts where you can't see the whole project. Recent posts that just show a baby or pet wrapped up in a blanket so you can't see what the FO looks like annoy me, but afghans or other projects that happen to have a cat in the picture are fine. For my last post, I couldn't keep my kitty off the blanket, and used her to show the scale. 




 Imma add this to my many reasons to move to Andorra. 




 Bobby pins don't do jack in my hair, but I buy them all the time. 




 I'd take it as a compliment, but I'm a very strange young woman. I pride myself on the fact that I'm a 21-year-old grandma (my chocolate chip cookies have been grandma level since I was 14), and grandmas are awesome (except that awkwardly racist one that some people have).

You have a skill that is becoming lost among the younger generations, so you're keeping a great craft alive. 




 I'd ask her. Burgundy is gorgeous, but isn't really maroon. Unless it's a surprise, maybe you could try to take her shopping with you. Or your uncle, or someone who knows her taste well. I took my mom with me to make sure the colors for my sister's afghan would be nice.

EDIT: and I plan on asking my sister for advice for my mom's.  




 Late to the game, but this organization was recommended by a person in the stitch n bitch I'm starting on my campus once classes start. If I weren't trying to cram three and a half afghans by Christmas, I'd join in as well. 




 I just finished every season of HIMYM that's on Netflix. Thankfully I had already seen the end, else I'd have to find it elsewhere online.

Afhghans and Netflix are perfect for each other. 




 I'm gonna head over to the liquor store when I can work up the heart to move the napping cat in my lap. 




 How can you get striping tape to stick like that? I've only tried once, with a liberal application of top coat, but the tape peeled off in 45 minutes.  




 My ghetto apartment doesn't even have a roll, so it has to go on the awkwardly covered radiator next to the toilet.

And somehow I'm happy living here for three years. 




 I strictly follow the 2:1 ratio, but I've heard other people say that simply cover in the rice with an inch of water also works. A lot of recipes say not to peek, ever, but it really isn't that finicky. 

Try making it a few times in small batches and it'll become second nature. 




 Cooking rice on the stove has some big scary stigma, but I do it at least weekly, and it's done by the time I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get ready. Fluff, put it in the fridge, fried rice for dinner every night. 




 Perfect brioche take 8 hours, minimum, and if you can master a 4-strand braided circle, you will win at life (or so I've been told when I do this).  My recipe is from a book called "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie," although I will always add a pinch or two of nutmeg.

Home made croissants are also impressive, and take more than 8 hours to make properly. And once you learn how to make that dough, you can make pain au chocolat, or beautiful fruit turnovers, or pretty much anything that requires puff pastry. I'm a girl, so I can vouch that saying "yeah, I made this from scratch" will get me wet, when it comes to puff pastry.  




 I used two strands throughout.

Basic pattern:

Chain 32 with two strands of the starting color (in this case, green or white)

Dc 14 rows

Tie off one of the strands and switch to the other color.

Dc 14 rows. 

Repeat.

Make the same strips, starting with a solid of the other color, sew then together.

This one is throw sized, shown on a couch with a very small kitty (Kate is only around 7 pounds,  even though she's almost 16 months old, just like my other baby, Bill). 









 This is why I always keep the lid down. Otherwise the cats wouldn't drink any other water, and my apartment is ghetto enough for the toilet to inly flush half the time. 




 And doing that thing cats do where they repeatedly poke your face the second you start stirring at all. Assholes. Adorable, lovable assholes. 




 I usually carry my groceries back in my backpack, and they both jump in the second it's opened. 




 That happened to me even during Freshman year of college, when I was blessed with never having hangovers. Now I just make sure to get a water after every drink or two, or chase with water if I make the (always horrible, terrible, no good, very bad) life choice to take shots. 




 Drunk me left a pair of glasses at a rando's house. 




 Sugar pie baby cat/ you know I love you/ I can't help myself/ I just love to snuggle you. 




 I won't have a projector or anything, but I carry my laptop with me to class anyway, so that would probably help. 




 That is a great idea! Last night, I just realized that I don't really know how to explain these things because they're second nature to me now. Maybe I could even show some of these videos from my laptop, since it will be after class anyway. 




 These aren't really classes, more getting people together to work on a common hobby. Some people have just expressed an interest in learning. It will be taking place in a lounge in the dorm where I used to live, and many people seem to be especially interested in philanthropic projects (hats for kids at the local battered women's shelter, project linus, etc). Some people already know how, and some will also be knitting (which is not my forte at all), so I may have some help there. 




 I don't go to mine often, just because I need to spend money on food more than nice yarn, but I know most of the women who work there are bistitchual.  I'll probably go there tomorrow, since I've got some things to do in town, anyway. 




 Maybe next time I go to the yarn store, I can ask the ladies there how they teach. Most of them are knitters, though. I'm not against knitting, I just vastly prefer crochet. 




 So, I've decided to start a stitch n bitch group on my campus in the fall, and have said that I will teach people the basic stitches (ch, sc, dc, etc.), but just realized that I'm not sure how to go about that.

I know I will start with simple projects, like scarves, wrist warmers, and hats in the round after a while, but I'm not sure how to describe how one does the simple stitches. I know I get confused reading patterns, and I've been crocheting for over a decade. 

Without saying things like "insert hook, yarn over, pull through, yarn over, pull through both loops," how would you describe a sc? I'm guessing these people to be complete newbs, with no experience, and I don't think I can go around the circle teaching everyone separately. 




 Nudge. Nudge nudge.
Nudge nudge nudge nudge.
Nudge.
Now your cup is on the floor. 




 Oh, I've lived here my whole life, almost 22 years. Back home, we've had some trees go down and almost hit the house, but we have a basement that's practically a bomb shelter.

My apartment is just old and ghetto with shitty windows. Last September, when we had that warning, I brought the cat I had then down to the laundry  room because I'm a wimp, especially when it comes to the safety of my babies. 




 Now I'm afraid about leaving my cats in my apartment near campus while I have lunch with the family in the far far west side. May just need to be a playdate.  




 And feeling sexy doesn't have anything to do with wanting to have sex/make babies. I often put on a full face just to go buy eggs and watch Netflix all day. I like to feel awesome, and sometimes that means I have to put in the extra effort to look awesome. 




 I only braid it when I'm making a big (2+ batch) loaf for a party and want to impress. Otherwise, loaf pans are fine because the buttery, eggy, fatty deliciousness of brioche is more important than presentation. 




 Since /u/3rdcoastwonder is a coach, I'm guessing he means something like surprise race runs. Going into practice, you warm up as you normally would, then do a time trial or two for the races you usually swim. Practice pools are usually warmer than race pools. 




 Had a professor once who noticed that a lot of the class was out sick for two weeks. He told us to take a strong shot or two of bourbon for each cup of lemon tea.

I took his class the next two semesters in a row. 




 Where do you find this? I can get Harpoon craft cider, which also tastes like aj, but I love me some cider. 




 Still less than three inches deep. 




 Sweet! Thanks, that sounds perfect, then. And as I said, freezing those thick fries/chips is incredibly easy, so I think I will be set. Thank you again! 




 Can you safely freeze fish? I figured it would lose too much, texture wise, but being encased in batter would keep it more moist.

My friends say I'm the queen of freezing (I regularly buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze individual portions), but I'm never sure about fish.

As background, I'm in Indiana, so most of the fish I get has either already been frozen and rethawed (bacteria if I freeze it again?) or really expensive.  




 Some of the fish stick recipes I've seen have you cook the sticks all the way, then only use the oven to reheat them. Maybe that could work for the batter, too?

I would just buy a bunch of fish and go to town trying to find a way, but I'm a college kid on a budget. 




 I've been told I'm really weird for this, but I even like to snack on it raw. Maybe dip it into a mix of plain Greek yogurt and various seasonings (garlic/onion powder, chili powder, etc.) like you would dip any other vegetables. 




 I have been going through the most intense fish and chips craving recently, but I don't want to keep ordering out (there's only one place in town that will deliver them, and very few that serve them to begin with).

I've found recipes for making things like fish sticks, but that doesn't have the delicious batter.

Could I flash fry the battered fish, like you would pre fry the chips, and then heat them up in the oven? I would love to make a big batch to save.

Tl;dr: is there any way to freeze a properly battered fish to have fish and chips on deck? 




 My ginge boy likes to use the shower. He's learned several phrases, but "I'm mad at you" is not one. 




 This is what snapchat is for. 




 When I was still getting over a dislocated knee, I still worked cute sundresses with my sneakers and huge, ugly knee brace. Not too bad, since I needed it, but I was given some serious shade by the more "fashion forward" girls on campus.

EDIT: I also had some trouble shaving my legs during the recovery process, so by the time the winter from hell was over, I looked like a bear. 




 I recently gained a lot of weight. I was a size six for as long as I could remember, then had some serious joint issues, so I couldn't work out at all without feeling like death for days after. I was just able to go shopping last week, and it hurt realizing that I was up to a 14. I'm tall, and it doesn't feel as bad as other things that have happened in my life, but vanity sizing like this angers me. 




 Like I said, it was the first time I dabbed. My tolerance was high enough to be able to drive after smoking a joint, I had no idea how much higher I would get. 




 Another way to make us size-14's feel bad about ourselves. 




 Kitty looks just like my big boy Guillaume!  




 Makes me remember the first time I dabbed. Did three in a row, not thinking. Had to drive an hour and a half to pick up my mom from the airport an hour later. Worst. Idea. Ever. 




 Chemicals, yes. Everything in the world is composed of chemicals. Air? H2O. But chemicals that cause cancer, unlikely.  




 Yup. In my town, you can find a shitty chillum for $10. I've smoked out of cans, plastic bottle bongs/steam rollers, hasn't killed me yet.
Edit: phone autocorrect 




 Yeah, I originally thought it was /r/beer for some random thing. 




 More short stories should be, though. We only read Huckleberry Finn, and I think this and the War Prayer are equal, if not better, social commentary that is still relevant today. 




 The War Prayer is amazing, as well. 




 Yeah, I can only watch it every few months cuz it puts me in such a bad place for days, even stone cold sober.  




 Mine seem to listen to me more when I'm speaking French. Somehow, they'll always stop whatever they're doing at "tu sais mieux que ca," but never at "you know better." 




 Haha, mine always rub on my legs right after I get out of the shower, them give me a dirty look for getting them wet. CATS! 




 Like everyone else has said, get Smithville if you can. Comcast, on top of being pure monopolistic evil, will fuck you over every have they get. My neighbors can only get AT T, I can only get Comcast. Last time I tried to call, I was put on hold for 45 minutes before my call was disconnected.  




 Mine was more than a week. A friend's  5 days before Halloween, mine the next day, Halloween, bff's on the 2nd..... then another two a week later.

Hooray for confirmed Valentine's Day babies. 




 My neighbor registered his Chihuahua as a service dog for his "separation anxiety." 




 Haha, before I moved and had a bathtub shower, my Kate would do the same. She'd sometimes even sit on the far side of the tub and just stare. 




 Exactly. And good home made bread doesn't have a great shelf life. I make brioche for myself about once a month and have to eat it in two days if I want it to be good, and it takes a shit load of eggs and butter. 




 She specified these colors. I was initially doing a houndstooth pattern, but realized it was gonna take way too long. This one is already almost two months late, since it was supposed to be for her graduation, but each strip only takes about a day. 









 Holy frick, those earrings tho! The makeup is also gorgeous, but I can't get over your earrings.  




 Hell yeah, I'll try to stop by! You're really close to my place, and I love yard sales 




 Surprised at how much I dislike Guinness. The Asahi tasted like your generic big brewery stuff, somewhere between Bud and Hamm's cola. The Midwestern Pale Ale is perfect for people like me, who generally don't like things that are super hoppy. 




 Got a mix-a-six with Baltika #9 (a favorite), Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat, Upland Wheat Ale, Guineas (which I've somehow never tried), Bell's Midwestern Pale Ale, and something foreign, Asahi "super dry" with a bunch of stuff in maybe Japanese, far from any language I speak.  









 And the picture in that pattern is the exact same one as the post.... 




 Only? Of course I clicked the link and started hyperventilating.  




 Like others have said, the Morgan-Monroe park, Brown County forest, and  McCormicks Creek are great. I also suggest the hiking trails around Lake Griffey, and (if it's available for you) Merengo Cave or Spring Mill state park. 




 You can swim in Lake Lemmon? I've tried so many times to find a place that isn't for boats, but never found one. And I've lived here my whole life 




 On top of the fact that Quebecois is one of the ugliest versions of French. Sorry not sorry to you Quebecois people. 




 I don't see how voice commands are better. I remember soending a few days with my grandmother last month, and she kept trying to find out the scores from White Sox games, and it was always faster for me to just type "white sox scores from (date)" because her phone took too long to figure out what she was saying. 

Might have had a bit to do with her Wisconsin accent, but still. 




 Even though it's summer (at least where I am), I'd suggest a soup. I'm not sure if the exact recipe, but my mother makes a great soup with kale, leeks, wild rice, and turkey.

My tip is to find meats at the store that are super in sale (for me it's usually because their sell by date is the next day), portion the chops into bags, and freeze. I can make one package of frozen chicken breasts (usually around $4) and two packages of pasta (~$2 each) last a week when I have veggies, butter/oil, spices, and a dozen eggs (~$3 here). 




 I like lemon tea with a bunch of honey. The lemon clears things up, the honey makes it stick around longer. 




 Are you on the south side? A few of my friends there have seen bikes go missing/have theirs get stolen 




 Don't be ashamed or whatever. I'm a bi girl, and while I can see how genitalia is hot in the moment, it looks fuckin' weird out of context. 




 Like everyone else has said, so sorry for your loss, but it happens to most people, and it does get better.

We had to put my dog down when he was 15 and I was 16. He had terrible arthritis, so would just lie around all day, then get seizures because he couldn't get up to eat. The last six months or so, I made sure to snuggle up in him as much as I possibly could. That was 5 years ago, and I still get sad sometimes thinking about him, but it gets better. 




 I can't comment on Little Blue's, but I got both of mine done by Giacomo at Skinquake and he's amazing. Mine are both simple, but look up his portfolio. 




 Yeah, my family always called them one-eyed egyptians. Not sure where that came from, but that's what we always called them 




 Mulberries are in season, and it's been a tradition for me to pick a bunch and make things with them.

The obvious choices for these wonderful things are pies, cobblers, scones, muffins, and other baked goods.

But I challenge you all who can get to them to make something savory with these berries.

Last year, I made a bunch of spicy Asian inspired dishes with the 2+ pounds of mulberries my friends and I picked.

Idk if challenges are actually ok, sorry if they aren't, but try, kids! Spicy berry pasta is one of my favorite things, so try it out. 




 After reading through that website (thank you!), I think I will try to get to know this kitty for a bit.

Where I grew up, there were a lot of ferals and strays, so I've learned the difference. The cat my parents currently have was a stray that took more than a year to get close to us.

This cat has only been out during the day, and has come fairly close to me. I think she's a stray, not feral, from my experience. I did call the shelter to ask what I should do, but I will wait a bit before taking her there.

I will continue to leave food out, as she seems quite skinny, and see if she becomes more used to my presence.  




 They don't have to be, although most people I know have done it. This cat may be, but that's a big reason why I want to get it to the shelter. 




 I just saw it again, and s/he looks fairly mangy close up.

My local shelter is luckily a no-kill, and I just want to find out if it's microchipped. There's some possibility, if it isn't and would be compatible, I'd bring it into my home, but I already have two. S/he seem quite skittish, probably because s/he's been outside for a while.

I am going to call my shelter to see about anything else I should do. 




 Hello! I've been seeing a tuxedo cat with no tail wandering around my apartment for a few weeks now.

S/he seems to be an adult, probably 18 months or older, black with a white stomach and face, with no tail.

I don't think anyone would let their cat roam around outside in this area (Fess and Atwater) because there's way too many cars and streets, so I'm thinking it may be lost or a stray.

If you know anyone who is missing a cat with this description, please let me know. I'm planning on asking around, and if none of my neighbors know whose it is, I will try to lure it near so I can get it to the shelter.

Update: upon closer inspection, s/he seems a little raggedy, but definitely not feral. I will be working to gain his/her trust for a while, to see if s/he truly can be socialized. It looks like s/he has been out for quite a while, but still hmu if you know anyone who has lost a similar cat. 




 There's been a tuxedo with no tail wandering around my neighborhood for a few weeks now. S/he looks fairly well taken care of, like s/he may have been a housecat, but I'm in an area surrounded by apartments, near streets, so I don't think anyone would let their cat be an outsider.

Should I leave out some food to lure her/him near so I can take her/him to the shelter? Once I can think everyone will be awake, I'm gonna go around and ask about it, but I feel so sad thinking that this beautiful cat isn't being taken care of. 




 Prescription goggle exist, but I doubt you'd wanna put them on every time you toke. 




 I decide if something is appropriate based on whether or not you can see this mole I have on my chest.... specific for me, but it's a good guide for how low-cut I can go.
