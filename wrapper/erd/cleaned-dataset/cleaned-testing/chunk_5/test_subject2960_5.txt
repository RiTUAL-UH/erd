 I'm sure I've hid behind my intelligence in the past, but don't think I'd go so far as to say I use arrogance as a coping mechanism. I always figured I was probably pretty bright, but in the past 3 years I've had both psychologists and professors (several of each) tell me that I fit the bill of someone with a gifted level of intelligence. I can make small talk but I'd prefer to have a discussion. I don't assume that others are stupid or boring and am usually up for talking to just about anybody. That being said, I don't think its a stretch to think that a lot of people's interactions are pretty superficial.

I can also say that I really don't think most of the things you mentioned bother me, I'm comfortable in a crowd (I never have to withdraw or become overwhelmed) don't have any problems with loud noises or bright lights, Sometimes interruptions and disappointment can irritate me, but that's rarely and usually when I'm tired, hungry, or something else is impairing my judgement. 




 Hi /r/aspergers lately I've been going through a bout of depression and have been seeing a therapist. A few weeks ago I mentioned that I think I might have aspergers and he agreed that I do have "some" traits. The thing is there are a lot of things that seem so fundamental to the diagnosis that I don't seem to have. For example, I've never been over stimulated by sound, crowds, bright light, I have above average emotional recognition ( had this tested), I don't have any particular order of doing things and am very flexible as far as my daily routine is concerned, I'm not usually clumsy and apart from when I was growing never had any trouble, I don't speak in a monotone ( though I do sometimes raise my voice when excited), and I've been told that I have a very expressive face, people can read how I'm feeling easily.

At the same time, I've always had problems with social interaction. Extended eye contact feels intense and uncomfortable, I've always had a large vocabulary and constantly have to "dumb it down" for small talk, if I don't I sound pretentious. Sometimes a conversation will catch me off guard and I'll stumble over my thoughts (probably the worst part.) I also feel much more comfortable talking about weighty topics like literature, art, music, philosophy, history, politics, and science then I do talking about people and what I did on the weekend. I have an awful knack for steering conversations in the direction of these topics and can sometimes be pretty argumentative. I haven't had myself tested but my therapist and psychiatrist both agree that I probably have an IQ considerably above average. When I was younger I had a very hard time getting along with other kids because I didn't want to talk about sports and games I wanted to talk about big concept stuff. In addition I sometimes smile when people are crying around me, I'm good at comforting people but I have an instant smile response that I've never understood.

I think the thing that is probably most in line with the aspergers diagnosis is my obsessive compulsive tendencies. I'll get obsessed for a period of time about some concept or another and be stuck on it. These obsessions can cause me a lot of pain and when they were really bad would take over my life. Mostly they involve obsessing over philosophy and the meaning of my life. I have a few other past obsessions as well, for example I know a lot about Star Wars and its extended universe from when I was a kid/ teenager, probably more then anyone else I know. I'm not so interested in it now but I was when I was younger. When I was younger I had a huge interest in history and could describe a rough timeline of colonial north america, the world wars, and the rise and fall of the soviet union by the time I was 12. When I'm drunk or really tired I sometimes make irrelevant, or comments which the people around me might not understand referring to the knowledge I have about world affairs, philosophy, art, literature, etc.

I have had episodes of frustration and anxiety in the past, but this could have just as easily been a symptom of depression as aspergers. These episodes of frustration haven't gone a way particularly but often were the result of disappointment or (when I was younger) social rejection. 

Anyway if you've read this far, let me know what you think. 




 Yeah I know, overall it was probably a positive that they know how I'm doing now and that there are other people in their lives dealing with the same problems. That being said, I feel like I need to learn to hold back a little bit, I don't like getting into the habit of having these sorts of conversations because they tend to get put off most people. I find I'm only really like this with people like my parents and my close friends but I've had people distance themselves from me after these kind of conversations in the past. 




 I used to open up to people who I probably shouldn't have but have since gotten a lot better. I think I still have trouble letting conversations sort of get away from me, where I'm talking about subjects that might not be appropriate in a given situation. I'm especially cautious of the relationship between me and my close friends just becoming a commiseration group, or that I'll say too much and not realize it. 




 Recently I spent a week living with some close friends and am having a lot of trouble with how I acted while with them. It wasn't very long into the visit that me and my two close friends started talking about the very personal stuff that's happening in our lives. I'm suffering from depression, and during a conversation that my friend brought up I told them that I'd been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. They then told me that they were dealing with similar issues and were seeking help. The thing is, that this was more or less our conversation topic for the remainder of the week while I was there. I feel like I was a little too open with my friends and that I may have said too much. I mean we had a full blown conversation about suicide while out at a bar (while pretty drunk) and I don't know what to feel about that. 




 I feel like every time I'm out with people I end up being too jokey, or too loud, or too eager to keep the conversation going. I don't know how this happens, but it always seems as though I'm joking around or participating more actively in conversation than those around me, silence amongst a big group just freaks me out a little so I feel like I almost need a to keep a running commentary going (not quite but sort of). How do I change my conversation style so that it encourages others to keep conversations going or joke around. How do I check myself when I'm running the conversation a bit too much? 




 Yes exactly, "Oh why did you tell your friends what happened?" maybe because you did the worst thing you could possibly have done to me and you deserve to be chastised by people who used to care about you. If you cheat on somebody you're a traitor and that's the worst there is regardless of gender. 




 Honestly, fresh wounds burn deep. Of course you aren't over the breakup if it happened the other day or the other week or what have you; a few years and then yeah you're dealing with some issues, but being bitter in the short term after a breakup is obvious. 




 I'll put on my nerd cap for a moment and user a tolkien analogy. After frodo spent so much time with the ring and after being stabbed by an evil blade he recovered but every year he'd become I'll and melancholy afterward. Some things never heal all the way. 

I feel that for those if us who get better from depression the wound heals but there'll always be a scar. We'll always remember what it was like to be depressed, so it never totally leaves us.

Just my take 




 She's the only complaint I've had. 




 yeah, at least I can be confident about that (she isn't the only one who's told me this)

edit: I've had others make a comment about size, not complaints.  




 Let me count the list of things my ex said to me in a single breakup conversation.

- I only stayed with you because I was afraid of being alone.

- There's someone else, I cheated on you.

- I don't think I've ever been attracted to you.

- My parents think you're lazy and don't think you're good enough (translate: I think you're lazy and aren't good enough) 

- Sex with you always hurt, sex with other guy doesn't

- I don't know why you're so beaten up, I'm not going to lose any sleep over this.

- You were my best friend


Great things to hear from the closest person in your life especially when dealing with depression.  




 Oh, this one I know. 




 In my personal experience, I had huge level of existential anxiety before my current depression. I'd say that I went through an "existential crisis" that was on and off for about half a year, the depression really started when I began applying it to my life. 

All that being said, I'm sure that it can happen the other way too.  




 For the past few weeks I've been feeling better about myself, I was starting to feel I might actually have some worth or someway out of feeling horrible. Then this week was my ex girlfriend's birthday. She left me for a tall, handsome, talented, socially comptant engineer. All I've been thinking about is how unappealing I am, every horrible thing that I can think of about me. I'm short, scrawny, have acne, am socially awkward, insecure, argumentative, anxious, needy and boring. I basically have every unattractive characteristic there is. 
       I screwed up everything to the point where she was the only thing making me happy anymore. Things were looking good at the beginning of last year, then I went and messed everything up. We were even planning to move in together sometime this year, now I'm more alone then I've ever been.

I though I was feeling better, I thought i was moving past this and putting that relationship to rest. That's obviously not the case. 




 I have an awful time carrying on conversations via text messaging. If I'm not planning on meeting up with someone the whole conversation usually just goes absolutely nowhere. I find it limiting and almost impossible to have a decent conversation over any kind of instant messaging. Its seems to me that other INFJs might have similar difficulties and am curious what you have to say. 




 My depression fluctuates between insomnia and fatigue. At the moment I'm experiencing quite a bit of fatigue, sometimes I don't even notice how exhausted I am, but I can fall asleep at almost anytime and anywhere, it's not really helpful while in school. 




 I haven't written a poem or piece of prose in weeks, I keep meaning to perform at my local poetry nights, but I just don't have anything coming to me. Not to mention I haven't touched my sketch books in almost  a month. So yes It makes me feel creatively suffocated.
 




 I think I'd have liked to have been born in the late 19th century/ early 20tu and have been living my prime in the 1920's.  




 Sorry didn't mean to imply that this doesn't happen for women also, just from what I've read that behaviour appears more often in men. 




 I like it for the first few drinks, but after 3 or 4 drinks I'm all filters off and usually get a little ranty; not about anything in particular but I do sort of go off on tangents. In the morning I usually feel a little embarrassed about some of the stuff I talked about, I don't like letting those filters down. 




 Everything I've read on the subject has said this. It's not every male. if you'd like to show me otherwise please do. 




 Yeah I think it's one of the biggest things that should be discussed in the depression community. I walked around j for months absolutely frustrated and resentful, then had a month or two with a very bad temper.  It's definitely a bit of a different beast and I think it would help a lot of guys dealing with depression to know that male depression can differ from female depression pretty drastically. Males are far more likely to become consumed in work/school and try to distract themselves by running themselves ragged. Males are also much more likely to channel their depression into anger than necessarily despair. 




 Have to say I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions of depression. Depression, as depicted in the media is much more similar to the symptoms of female depression, male depression can be quite a bit different. 




 Every time someone writes a comment like this I feel that it's more about the commenter than the O.P.. Don't get me wrong, I see where you are coming from, but the way you worded your response seems very personal.. 




 I've been trying to surround myself with down to earth, well grounded people. I've been trying my best not to distract myself all the time, but escapism does offer itself easily as a way to distract me from anxiety/depression. I will out right admit that these thoughts consume me the most when I'm alone, especially when I don't have a lot of people around (I.E. friends go home from college.) My mind just tends to wander in this direction every time.

I have to disagree that the answer is simply "doing things" when nearly everyone around me is steeped in things that make my perceptions painfully evident. I've considered the possibility that I may have arbitrarily skewed the framework of my perception to fit anxieties that I'm having, but most evidence would suggest otherwise.

I interact with very few people on the internet so I think your comments on meeting people here are a little misplaced. Though, I have been working on meeting new people who do not share my hangups and it seems to be helping my situation to a degree.

Thanks for the reply. 




 I feel like "drinking the kool aid" is what it's going to have to come down to , either that or become a complete pariah. I just find that this conclusion doesn't completely satisfy me and its depressing that the way I perceive things will only cause me pain. 
      What you described, the whole investigation into semiotics and postmodernism, is almost exactly what I was getting at. To sort of paraphrase Nietzsche I feel like I'm wrestling with monsters. I don't fault people around me for not choosing to do the same. In fact I feel that this problem is the root of my depression, even though it is probably one of those questions that does not have an answer. 




 I've been having severe anxiety about my life for the past 2 years. Basically along the lines of how I conduct myself, how I spend my time, wether I'm living a life that is worthwhile and productive. Sometimes in the last 2 years it's been to the point that I wasn't going outside much and spent a lot of time reading.

My biggest issue was that I was having a great deal of anxiety regarding the media and how it affects people. After reading books like 1984, and to a greater extent Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, I became really fixated on how the media I consume affects my mind. I know this sounds paranoid, believe me many times I've felt I was losing my mind with how anxious I was, but many, many very well respected and intelligent people have written about exactly what I'm talking about. People have written whole books in fact

ex: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death]

I now get very anxious about what I read, watch, listen to, and generally participate in. I've become very aware of which popular news papers are directed at which audience and its not a very difficult thing to do. Writing style, content, advertisements are all indicative of the sort of people that the publication is being directed to.

In general I feel like I'm being shoehorned into a specific consumption and that my life is full of distraction. I feel as though me and everyone around me are being distracted which prevents us from reaching our full potential. 

I've tried so many times to get out of this thought loop but I fail every time. I can't stop feeling anxious about it, I'm so afraid that I've wasted my life and that I'll never reach my potential because I'll always be driven to distract myself. The worst part is that every person speak to about this, college professors, my therapist, all agree that my observations have a great deal of truth to them, so I can't be completely deluded.

I wish I could stop thinking about it but I can't, I wish I could go back to not thinking about what I consume and just live a life of ignorance. I don't know, does this sound as off the wall to you as it sometimes does to me? Is my anxiety founded or am I walking a thin line of falling into an even darker arena than anxiety? I don't know I just can't seem to escape these thoughts, they're so fundamental to my life and how I'm going to live. 




 Laying in my old car with my ex, in the middle of winter at night. We'd driven to an camp ground that was empty for the winter and were parked next to a lake surrounded by trees. We were just looking at the stars. I've never seen stars like that before. 

 




 despairing, angry, overly emotional. I was feeling fairly numb and I'd do anything to feel something so I acted fairly extreme, if I felt anger I just sort of went with it. The rest of the time I was just ice cold cynical and negative, about everything. I had some pretty serious anxiety and angst going on as well. 

Since I've been on the medication I've felt like I have more of a floor to stand on and that there's less chance the bottom will fall out of my life. I feel a little hesitant to say this but it might be that I have a little bit more hope these days.
