 He reminds me of Kerrigan with stronger 1v1 and weaker ults. Insane duelist but very awkward in a team fight.

Basically, he's going to kill you, unless something kills him first. 

































































































































 The dude took her 45% Iowa lead to 19% in 2 months, has received donations from 5 times as many people as Hillary, and can't find a venue large enough to hold all of his supporters. And yeah, she's got more money but he's running a much leaner, grass roots campaign. Really the only thing she has on him is billionaires, and with the type of campaign that he's running, that might not even be much of an issue.

Don't count him out yet. 




 How fast do your private police and firemen respond, and what does your premium cost? 




 As an American, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren seem like two great politicians and a breath of fresh air.

 




  I wish there were more candidates with his integrity.

FTFY. We need more people like him on both/all sides of the isle. 




 Thanks for posting this!

I think [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016) might be a better link for primary election dates, though. Unless I'm mistaken, the one you linked only hast the dates from 2012. 




 For the people, *by* the people. 




 The fact that you think that a few lines in The Old Testament account for "everything that God says", while disregarding practically everything that Jesus says, tells me that I probably shouldn't even be responding to you... 




 I'd imagine that's why he's running in the primary... 




 What would you say those faults are? What makes him the "least awful" as opposed to "the best"? 




 He's technically a "democratic socialist". It's probably more fair to say that he's a populist more than a socialist.

It's kind of nuanced, so if you want to know what he believes, this interview covers his positions really well:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo 




 People are excited about a good, honest man with a real shot of becoming president.

That doesn't really happen all that often. 




  He's obviously going to raise taxes like crazy to pay for these ridiculous programs - he just hasn't been pushed to admit it yet.

He "admits" it constantly. If you've ever heard him speak, he repeatedly says he's going to raise taxes on super rich to help the 99%.

His response to pretty much anything he's ever been asked is one of the following:

* We need to raise taxes on the rich.
* If you want to know Hillary's position on that, don't ask me, ask her.

 Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders. 




 This is the first time that I've considered a write-in as well. I always wondered what the point was. Now I know. 




 I agree, and your username is awesome. 









 Is the issue the "Republicans for Bernie - Republicans for Bernie"? Honestly just a copy and paste mistake, but I'd like to know for when I repost it. 




 Only if you disagree with him. This interview gives you some good insight into his positions:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo 




 That's probably why nobody's saying that. 

















































  EDIT: Ugh, give your $3.99 to Bernie. No one should be giving anyone gold on this subreddit, donate it to the campaign instead and tell the OP a "hey I donated $3.99 on your behalf."

hey I donated $10.00 on your behalf ;)

I wasn't the one that gilded you, just to be clear. 




  Please. The House isn't switching before the 2020 census, when districts get redrawn, at the earliest. The Senate, if the candidate has some coat tails, can flip.

That's fair. 










































































 Or the best. 




 If enough people show up to elect Bernie, they'll almost definitely also put a congress that'll work with him in place. The reason that the people are much more liberal than the government is that old people vote and young people don't. But Bernie definitely has enough young people fired up that they'd actually show up on election day.

 Welcome! Very glad to have you aboard.

Mind sharing your feelings on why you switched? I'm particularly interested to hear which issues were most significant for you, and why you feel Bernie's stance on them is a better fit for you (and America).

Thanks. 




 Agreed on all points. I wish Sanders would be more vocal about it, though. I wonder if he's trying to show campaign platform restraint by not running on too many things. It's the only reason I can think of why he's not speaking out for more for legalization. 




 Depends on your perspective. Here's [my opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3brr5m/bernie_sanders_is_an_american_politician_who_has/csp4ek0). 




  You seriously think that less than 1% of the public would quit working, if they were able to make as much or more than they do now but without working?

I think exactly that, yes. 




 I disagree. I'm rather confident that 99% of the population would agree that $12k per year is not enough, and would work towards more. 









 Believe it or not, paying people to do nothing is a large and immediate disincentive.

If someone guaranteed you a paycheck of $1,000 per month, you wouldn't quit your job and do nothing, and neither would 99% of the rest of the population. 






















































 Yeah, for this to work in the US it'd have to be something like $800 to $1,500 per month, similar to [what they're trying in The Netherlands](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/07/01/3676097/utrecht-universal-basic-income/). 




 It's a good thing basic income doesn't disincentivize productivity, then. In fact, it's been shown to increase productivity. 




 You can still advertise your meeting. Just duplicate the /r/Dayton post in this sub (and don't ask for upvotes). 




 Worked for me. Got the same message and restarted twice. I got in on the third try.

Thanks for posting this. I wouldn't have tried the restarts otherwise. Oh and BoE is the map. Bonus! 







































 Yeah, I found them incredibly mundane as well. 




 I think it's an official thing. 























































































































 That looks fantastic! Nicely done. 




 I was about 20 minutes into a game yesterday before realizing that I didn't have Prog Rock. They moved it and I just looked at the icon, not the text.

On the plus side, I had plenty of mana! 




  It's funny how the ragers always are the worst players on a team, without exception.

FTFY 
























 They're supposedly re-editing it to be chronological. I'll probably give it another try then, but I gotta say, I am not looking forward to it. 




 He just keeps outdoing himself. #FeelTheBern 






















































 That's odd. Why would they go straight from 3 to 5? That'd be like making an Indiana Jones 5...

If anyone needs me, I'll be in denial. 




 I'm like 10 episodes in. I just can't stomach anymore. It stretched everything out way too long, it wasn't funny, and it wasn't Arrested Development.

If 10 of 15 episodes isn't enough to get an idea of the season, I guess I'm just missing out. 




 This interview sums it up rather nicely:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo 




 Integrity. It costs. 




 It is a good thing when the norm of your profession is to use/abuse it for personal gain, not to mention that it's a lot easier to represent people when you understand the lives that they lead. 




 Ha, I totally didn't notice that. Good catch. 




 Here's a great interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo

Or if you just want to get pumped, here's 3 minutes of moving remarks:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ 




 Thank you for posting this. I think it's very important. Bernie is running a positive campaign, and I think we, as a sub, should emulate that. 




 Yeah, wish I could go :( 









 It's actually very significant.

It shows that in a time when people consider politicians to be greedy and entirely self serving, Sanders hasn't used very powerful position for personal gain. By politician standards (especially by senator standards), he's downright poor.

It also shows that while most politicians are very much out of touch with the lives of ordinary people, Bernie's modest lifestyle shows that he knows exactly what the lives of his constituents are really like.

Looking at all of his extremely populist positions, it's obvious that he's for the people, but this demonstrates that he is also *of* the people. 




 Oh, I was looking [here](http://www.heroesnexus.com/heroes/26-brightwing). Must not be updated. 









 I can't make this one, but I think it's wise to keep the date as is. We can add another one at a later date if there's enough interest. 




 I can't make it on the 11th (family plans) but I'd definitely be interested in future meetups.

Thanks for organizing this! 




 West Chester here. I'd be interested! 





























 Me too. I went digging for it after I saw that he reported $200k in income this year. I thought for sure he'd have at least a few million to his name, since he's been a senator for so long. Nope. Practically poor in politician terms.

The guy is not only for the people, he's *of* the people. 









 I haven't played the new BW yet. How do you give an ally spell shield? 




 Also, let us toggle the mount on and off on the play screen, too, so we can get a better idea what our skin/tint/mount combo looks like. 




 Yeah, though I get that impression just listening to the guy speak. He's nothing short of incredible. 




 Add an extra space between each one if you want them on individual lines. Or use bullet points.

Thanks for adding this! 




 I don't think it's ridiculous to get excited the possibility that a great man with unchanging convictions who cares about and prioritizes the needs of the people becoming the president of the united states.

I don't find anything ridiculous about that at all. 




 I think he's got a real chance, especially because cries like this have lessened dramatically. Just a few weeks ago you'd hear "He's amazing but he'll never win!" dozens of times per day. This is only the second time that I've heard it in probably over a week.

Overcoming that was a really major hurdle, and he got past it pretty quickly. He's flying up in the polls (they look better every day), he's getting insane turnouts at his rallies, he's raising good amounts of money (from people, not corporations or SuperPACs), and most importantly, he's clearly the best person for the job.

I think we're actually going to win this thing. And by "we" I mean America. 




 2,577 Chicago Police Hours Spent on Cannabis Arrests Just in the Last 30 Wasted

Much better. 




 He uses them every match. Or do you think he could look like a ridiculous, whimsical owl without them? 




 Only the government. The American people are actually much more liberal than the government, but old people vote and young people don't, so we end up with representatives that are significantly more conservative than those they're (supposed to be) representing.
