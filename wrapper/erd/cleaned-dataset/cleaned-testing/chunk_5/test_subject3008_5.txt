 Shit. I thought I posted ymm.2004 Chrysler Sebring 




 Yeah. That is a hard thing to deal with. 




 Just give it a try. It's easy....well once you get past cursing at an inanimate object. 




 Or Blu-ray player that is Wi-Fi enabled 




 Could you name some of those fields of work? This is a new topic for me. 




 Thanks for the reply. My brother Paul loves corn (or he at least loves saying it.) So yeah...I assumed you were him for obvious reasons. 




 I agree with the tipping thing. If you live in USA and you don't receive absolute terrible service, tip something. Even bad (not absolute terrible) service deserves 7%. If you don't tip because you can't afford it, then you can't afford to go out.
The other things in your comment are things I do not care to have an opinion on. 




 I wrote a comment about this once before. I don't feel like retrieving it so either you can accept that or go look at my comments. 




 I love to work. I'd work 24 hours a day if it were humanly possible. I believe everyone should work (getting paid obviously) every spare minute. I had 2 full time jobs (40 hours a week each) and I wasn't getting enough work. People laugh at me and think it's weird but I can't help it. 




 Paul? 




 Sleepless in Mississippi 




 This one is less a "life hack" and more just using available technology to my advantage. I use my Samsung Wi-Fi connected smart tv to stream my digital media from my pc. No need to burn dvds or connect extra devices via USB (phone, USB drive, portable hdd, or other such devices.) I just obtain media and enjoy. ;-) 




 Do the same with Pringles. Same concept. 




 Damn. Of course. I really need to get on that going back into the Army thing I've been meaning to do. They'll pay for my education. 




 I did that on an application for a job yesterday. While being interviewed. Yes, I was being interviewed *before* I completed my application. I'm that good

 Those were my only purpose for going to kfc 




 Personally, I found their imitation of the big Mac to be better. Quite an improvement. 




 Rice krispies treats cereal is still here. MS, U.S. 




 That almost reminds me of those elf cookies that are elf shaped with fudge in the middle. I sadly can eat the whole container in  an hour 




 I can't seem to get my wife to understand this. 




 I agree with you on that. That's fact for a lot of things. If you pay $5 for x item and replace it 3 times a year. You just spent $15 plus tax and the gas to make multiple trips to the store or shipping fees on the internet on the "cheaper" product. If you go ahead and buy the $20 version of the same product, you'll save more on the long run. I spend more on my tv, computer, hdmi cables, car parts, etc because they'll last significantly longer and usually have protection plans. 




 That ridiculous neck wear? Or so I believe that's what it is from the way it's worn out here. 




 How and where? Where do I sign up? 




 I agree. This link explains a lot. http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/07/what-does-a-gigabyte-of-internet-service-really-cost-a-look-at-the-worst-case-scenario/ 




 Arrr motherfuckin rrrrr 




 I think that may be my problem... 




 Ummm.... it's impossible to lie on the internet duh. Which brings me to the topic of my million dollar super computer that I solely use for offline checkers. 




 I stopped the DVD when he was killed. I refuse to watch any further. My wife still watches. 




 1. If you truly want something you'll work hard for it. If you don't feel like working for it, you don't want/need it.
2. Take pride in what you do, regardless of what that may be. Even if it seems "menial". Have a great deal of self respect when doing it. The only person's opinion (that matters) about you doing a "menial" job, is yours.
3. When you're young and see adults being successful, don't expect to just become a successful adult. Don't get discouraged just because you aren't filling those shoes. That/those adult(s) didn't start that way. Hard work was a big part of it. Quitting because you didn't get there quick enough is pathetic. 




 6'3, blonde hair, blue eyes, deep voice, and just overall attractive. Also, my Irish alcohol tolerance. 




 I can grow a grand, thick, full beard. My problem is it feels like copper wire. I have this theory that if I were to pull enough hairs out I could wire my car with high powered speakers. 




 So that explains it... 




 Same here. Is pretty convenient when some asshole decides to hit and run. 




 Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet. 




 Mine is like that but more like 7.5 to 8 inches when fully erect. 




 This is quite the usual occurrence for me. Everyone thinks it's magic. I just tell them it's simple really. When they ask for further details, I give them the details and they roll their eyes and decide they didn't want to know. I might just adopt the "it's magic" line. 




 I was driving my car as usual this morning without any issues. I went around town and didn't have any problems. I came back to my apartment and drove to the apartment's dumpsters to clean my car out. When I went to leave the dumpsters and get back on the road, I started to back out and my car suddenly stopped like something was behind the tires. I got out of my car and checked thoroughly behind each tire. Nothing was in my way do I tried again. No luck. I drove forward at an angle and tried again. Still nothing. I kept changing angles and still nothing. I finally got away from the dumpster and parked by my apartment. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong but I'm getting no where. It also stops suddenly if I put it in neutral. In neutral, my car should start to go in reverse due to the slope in the parking spaces here. If anyone could give feedback I'd really appreciate it.

The engine is 2.4L 4cyl DOHC 16V SMPI
Transmission: 4  speed automatic.

 Let me get a job appy. 




 Or
Marijuana: *cough* *choke* (in a restrained voice) "That's good grass" 




 Marijuana: ... pass it on. 




 Justin? 




 As my previous comment. I feel your pain. I'm also a guy in this situation. 




 This doesn't work with my wife. For as long as I've known her she always has been quiet when I legitimately ask her what's wrong. I've never told her shit like "you're being too emotional" etc.
Edit: Also, she is the one that makes me feel like my concerns aren't rational or logical. Like how I feel about something isn't significant enough. 




 I'm experiencing the same thing but with my wife next to me. 




 There are a lot of repeat comments here. I would bring a handful of coins dated post 1994. Before anyone mentions fake coins. There are people whose job it is to verify coins and there legitimacy of said coins. 




 I love Forrest Gump and the shawshank redemption. I've never seen pulp fiction. Though if I were to watch a third movie from that year, I'd go for the lion king. 




 Middle school for me was the same 6th 7th and 8th. That wouldn't have been such a bad paper to write. 




 Okay. Fair enough. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I just know this sub is the only one that seemed appropriate enough. 




 Why such harsh words? 




 I usually can edit my posts but... reference the last bit of the topic. 4 am so on... Shoes are simple swap out for the desired pair and either hide old shoes under rack or in the box and pot the box under many boxes especially boxes of expensive shoes. These are purchased less often = more time to make the shoes "yours". Make them look used enough. Also, if your Wal-Mart employs careless people, bonus. Have two pairs of jeans, one wrapped inside the other. Change into one pair, wrap old jeans in the other new ones. Hide like with the shoes.
Put on a jacket/hoodie after removing the tags but do it around zero cameras. Walk around like it's yours.

This method is brought to you as the wardrobe method.


Again, reference the grammar section of the main topic post for this comment also. 




 A friend of mine does a lot of shoplifting and gaining things in a not so legal manner.

My friend, let's call him Bob.
Bob uses multiple methods to get things he wants and can't afford or doesn't wanna pay for. These things include Blu-ray players, pc software, portable hard drives, cell phone cases/other accessories, and other things such as these.

The shoplifting is done at Wal-Mart.
If it's small enough to fit in his pants pocket then obviously... if it's a little big for pants or coat pocket but still small enough, his wife puts it in her purse. Oh, did I mention he's married and he and his wife work together? Well let me mention it. Bob's married and he and his wife work together. If it's still too big for her purse then they use what they call the mark down method (mdm). The mdm is finalized at self checkout. By the way, Bob's wife's purse is actually a subtle looking diaper bag so plenty of space and lots of pockets. Anyway. The mdm as mentioned earlier has two ways of being done. Either they locate an item that is 1. Significantly cheaper than the targeted item. 2. Has a bar code sticker that can easily be peeled. If both requirements are met, they peel the bar code sticker off the cheaper item and cover the target's bar code sticker. They've used this first example of mdm for things like vacuums (Dyson) all the way to counter top appliances like blenders and crock pots.
Mdm#2: For large in size but slightly cheaper items they still can't afford/refuse to pay for. Usually food items/extra groceries. Bob and his wife locate and memorize a large enough produce item and memorize its plu code or the go to banana (4011). The rest of this method is self explanatory. (Self checkout with the volume muted).

You know the little plastic boxes that hold smaller easier but more costly products such as large capacity flash memory devices? The ones that usually hang from the wire rack and have the grey lid. You know, the clear hard plastic ones that usually contain video games or pc software or whatever! Well the alarm thing by the doors at the Wal-Mart here are crap. There are two sets of alarm things due to the entrance being so wide. Well if the product is carried just right in between both sets, it won't go off. Bob and his wife have gotten out with butt tons of merchandise this way. As long as it fits in her purse, out the door it goes.

If my grammar sucks, oh well. It's 4 am and I refuse to sleep because I haven't experienced sleep paralysis in a few days and just read a thread on /r/askreddit about it. 




 Higher education costs should be based on personal income. Just as federal student aid is income based. So should the cost of education. If I'm only financially eligible for x amount with a Fed grant, then I'm only capable of paying y amount. "Y" being a small percentage (if any) of what's left after federal aid. I should only be expected to pay what I can afford to pay.
