 *cough cough Running Red* 




 Oh god, I always forget another modpack exists with the same initials. It really messes me up sometimes .

Running Red? 




 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 




 Woot! No more buggy extension code! \o/ 




 205.5, if the Steam counter is to be trusted 




 My last item I needed was Meat Boy. It seems dumb, but every single time I was getting Bandage Girl instead. When I finally got all of Meat Boy (basically RNG, even if you had Book of Revelations, because the Meat Boy/Bandage Girl thing.). It unlocked the three (Platinum God, Real Platinum God, and Meat Boy) at once. So there ya go.

Being based off of Victor Frankenstein, the man who created the monster. (Common Misconception: The monster is never given a name, and is not called Frankenstein. That's the monster's creator.) 




 I stopped learning when I was able to play in class with the Vita 




 * Devil/Angel Rooms never spawn on the First Floor, however,
* The Goat Head ("He Accepts Your Offering") will force a Devil/Angel Room to spawn, no matter the floor
* Not taking damage on the floor increases the chance of a Devil/Angel Room spawning
* The Evil/Sin stat increases the chance of Devil Rooms
* The Faith stat increases the chance of Angel Rooms
* Making a deal with the Devil greatly lowers the chance of an Angel Room spawning, and will increase the chance of Devil Rooms 




 All you can do is praise to RNGesus it doesn't happen again 




 You can reach the Cathedral or Sheol after the Mom's Heart fight by getting a Devil or Angel room on that floor. Otherwise, you'll be forced into the chest.

However, after you've beaten Mom 10 times, whenever you go back down there again, you'll face off against It Lives!!! rather than Mom's Heart. After killing It Lives!!!, you'll be given the option to go to either the Cathedral or Sheol, every time you get that far. 




 I miss the textures. 




  **"Chub dislikes smoke!"**

This is a reference to how, when a bomb is placed while Chub is charging, he'll consume it and it'll explode within him. This is also a reference to Legend of Zelda, as a similar boss disliked smoke and was killed in the same manner (credit to /u/Aksh0le )

 **"Rooms may yield more than you expect - Experimentation is key"**
 **"A dark market lies under your feet"**

These refer to what's beneath the carpets Zelda-esque sleeping rooms and some rocks, as these trapdoors can sometimes lead to the Black Market rooms.

 **"The walls will harden over time - Time is the essence"**

This refers to how the Boss Rush Room only appears in the wall if you beat Mom in less than 20 minutes, else the wall will "harden" and you won't be able to access it.

 **"A piece of paper is your guide"**

This hints at the Missing Poster and the Mysterious Paper, which, when you die in a Sacrifice Room, will give you a piece of the puzzle to unlocking The Lost.

 **"Deny his gifts to attain your reward"**

This refers to how you have to forgo the offerings of the Devil Room in order for Angel Rooms to appear later.

 **"Sleeping gatekeepers will need to be awoken with a loud sound"**

This refers to how one must blow up the Angels in the Angel Rooms in order to fight them to attain the Key Pieces. I feel as though the Devils don't blow up like the Angels because Satan doesn't want you to fight him, as there's still a small chance he'll lose. Every offering he gives, although some make you stronger, also potentially make you weaker for the final battle against him.

 **"Some doors require a blessing - Carry them with you"**

This refers to how the Key Pieces, the blessings from the Angel Room, are needed to open the doors to the Mega-Satan boss. 














 I think it would be amazing to have someone write reviews on modpacks, mods, and does interviews, and whatnot. That's all we would need to make ModMyMC a full news outlet.

Several people (including yours truly .) have expressed interest in doing something like that. It wouldn't be restricted to just Feed the Beast, but could include AT Launcher, and Technic, and those doing interviews could speak with people prominent in the modding community. I personally would love to see something like this, but I don't  know if anyone else is.
