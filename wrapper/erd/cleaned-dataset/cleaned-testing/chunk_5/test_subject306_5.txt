 Yasuda is a fine choice, and priced reasonably 




 It's not all about BPA, and the fact your falling for that shit shows your all about the hype.  Harbs and Balke don't give a fuck about that, they're drafting off what gives the ball club the best competitive edge and need.  Your basically questioning the brain trust of a organization that has light years of knowledge and experience over your amateur thought process.  Get over it

 Mark Jackson isn't making the proper adjustments and its evident by watching our players trying to adjust since All-Star break.  The whole league knows our approach.

 seriously, the fine Brady had to pay for his slide was less than Gore.  Makes no fuckin sense 




 How ass backwards is your rules that the fine for Frank Gore (not wearing proper socks) was more than Brady's slide?  It makes no sense, and it shows you trying to bully a system and it's players.  No wonder you're rating is so low

 Feel bad for what?  Eating foods you normally don't get a chance to eat?   




 [You can prepare chicken in such a way that will kill off disease while leaving the flesh cold and uncooked.  In Japan, this is called toriwasa.  The idea is to cook all the of outward facing meat fibers to kill of disease that may have made contact.  Since these diseases dont penetrate into the flesh, deep frying or poaching for just a few minutes will kill off disease.](http://tonguecheek.com/2010/05/ask-a-chef-can-you-eat-raw-chicken/comment-page-1/)

 




 The [fun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sR0mrUU9bs) starts at the 2:24 mark.  Again, when your culture has been around for 2000+ years, basics such as produce and livestock are a completely different ball game than here in the US.  The knee jerk reactions are evident as to how naive you view world foods.   




 This is cultural, and perhaps even a difference in physiology.  Being Japanese, it's been in our society for hundreds of years.  Bodies respond differently.  I hear what you're saying, but I didn't even flinch for a second when this was offered.  Perhaps this [article](http://www.facingtherisingsun.com/japan-travel-tips-eating/raw-chicken-sashimi-torisashi-toriwasa) might shed light on this matter.   




 It's totally fresh unlike any kind of product here in the state's.   The chicken was raised local,  and killed that day.  Pretty common to find this stuff  









 Pretty neat to see identical runs against the Packers.  The kid is a straight up gamer, and he's ours!! 




 Plus we impose our will against the finesse teams.  I think this game will be decided early who controls the tempo 




 Were you a 80's kid?  I was, and this stuff was only being sold in the asian markets.   




 Whitmans all the way 




 Don Julio 1942, a little pricey but amazing 




 Can it be eaten sashimi style?  And cheers to the collarbone, looks amazing! 




 Can anyone suggest their tried and true methods for a boneless prime rib?  I^ve only cooked with bone in using 500 degree high heat for the first 10-12 min, then lowering the heat to 225-250.  Sorta worried that boneless will cook way faster, and a over cooked rib roast is sad for Xmas.  Im hoping reddit has some suggestions.  BTW, its a 1.6 kg rib approx 3.5 lbs.

 No disregard to Harbaugh, but Bellichick is a genius  




 And, to get to the Superbowl, there's a high probability that we have to play the Giants, and it could be in NY.  I hope the Giants don't become our arch enemy like the Cowbows were in the 80's.  Those were painful Championship games 




 Same thought process.  If Harbs was able get Alex to play above his potential, imagine what he can do with Kaep.   




 Coffee, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, white pepper, cumin, onion powder, paprika, season salt.  

Next time, try mixing a little apple cider vinegar with the juice

 Hey fellow Dub fans, my wife and I are headed to catch our beloved Warriors and wanted to make a sign for tnt's game.  A buddy of mine suggested Mark Jackson's catch phrase, "Mama, there goes that man!" 

Any other suggestions?   




 There's gotta be some weird correlation between sexual conquest at a real early age, and then not getting some during the peak years (17-22).  

You sound just like my friend, who almost got laid at summer camp when he was 9.  Fast forward to 18, and was getting no love.  He's now happily married at 35.

 I can already feel my Sat morning hangover coming with the mention of good beers and bourbon.   




 It's bittersweet to many I'm sure, and if I was a native BK'ner I'd have mixed feelings.  It's kinda 2 sided.  Stoked that there would be a NBA team, but pissed having to deal with the loss of neighborhood along with mad traffic and a increase in price for everything. 




 No it's all about Guy's American Kitchen

 Yes all around.  No offense to the bacon lovers, but these days I see a pic with the caption "who doesn't love bacon?!?!"  and it's just a glistening strip.   




 Look dip shit, you discovered Reddit, good for fucking you.  No go behave little boy or at least act respectful, bc this is amateur.   




 And this is why at times Reddit content goes to shit, and punk ass kids come on here thinking it's hilarious.  I'll be honest I've only been a member for 2 years, but it's changed alot, usually with immature fucks such as the post above.   




 Wonder if this is the same Ippudo as NYC.  Thanks for recs, if you're ever make your way to NY, PM me and I can return the favor.   




 You can try and join a tailgate, or your close by some awesome taqueria's.  Pick yourself up some burritos and beers and just chill.  Tacolicious is kinda close by 




 Love me some Chinese banquet food.  You can tell they went deluxe with the Shark Fin. 




 There was also a subtle reference in Something About Mary, the scene when him and Cameron Diaz are chilling sitting on top of a car talking passing a doob.  I wouldn't be surprised at all 




 You must be the boy that always got picked last in sports, and pretty much last in every category possible.  Congrats on finding Reddit and being a fucking loser on here as well.   




 My wife are I are doing a Japan tour, and have 2 days to kill in Kyoto.  Our hotel is at the Gojosagaru Horikawa Dori, Shimogyo.  Any recommendations would help.  We're both Japanese so language will not be a issue.   




 If we could swing a trade with the chiefs for safety Eric Berry, it would be a win win for both 




 Plus his rotation is terrible.  He's been playing Steph, Klay and Jack all at the same time, a la Nellieball at the end of games.  Sometimes it pays off, but it's starting to become a predictable trend 




 If you have a asian grocery nearby, you can make this at home, its easy and more fun than going to a resto.   




 Are you a fan or a hater?   




 Exactly this.  We've forgiven Alex many times in the past for mistakes, yet the moment Colin makes one he gets crucified.  Let's see how the kid bounces back from this 




 yeah bc monday morning/arm chair qb's such as yourself are guru's when it comes to football.   




 Not only this, let's at least give Kaep a chance to see how he responds to  a loss.  We've given Alex many chances prior, it's only fair to give Colin this same standard.   




 The 2 coaches that I fear are Fisher and Coughlin.   




 The road to the Super Bowl goes thru the Giants.  There's a good chance we play them again.   




 By any chance is your father a hemophiliac?

 That's why he took a year off and chilled out.  Unless you got facts about his financials you know the deal.  No source, no cred 




 if you're trying to stir the pot, you succeeded.  i'm calling you out because you have no basis for your post.  can you back up your claim, or are you just giving a opinion?  

no one has to keep moss satisfied, and if you've been reading the papers, moss has been a true veteran.  he's even suggesting plays that aren't designed for him. we're all fans with amateur opinions, but don't bring a useless claim.  what you just stated isn't a legit concern.   




 Come on knock on our door 




 To the Chiefs for Eric Berry would be super nice 




 Not even close dude 




 and your also a fan with a amatuer opinion with no basis whatsoever 




 Said this in another thread.  There's gonna be a 60-70 yd Kaep to Moss bomb coming soon 




 Thanks, it was a year.  I appreciate the answer, if you have any other info please pass it on!   




 hoisin with blue cheese, bold!   




 Throwing 3 int's is hardly spectacular.  And that injured finger excuse doesnt jive.  The fan boys have been making that excuse, not him.

2 years ago in NYC, I was busted for smoking a joint on the street. The court decided to offer an A.C.D (Adjournment of contemplation dismissal) if I didnt get into trouble after a year. My case would then be sealed.
Fast forward to present day, I'm applying for a job in pharma and was curious as to what will show on my background check. My guess was that since the case was sealed, it would not show, but wanted to see if Redditors out here had any insight to this. Any help would do

 wow you think of that all by yourself?   i see you always trolling the Kaep supporters, get off it.  We get your love for Alex and all, but you seem to talk this nonense bullshit.  

I said this another thread, whatever happens in the playoffs, whether we go all the way or lose 1st round, don't come around here saying "Told you Kaep sucks, or Alex wouldn't have lost"  bullshit

 The road to the Superbowl goes thru the Giants.  Alex played em 2x, and failed.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt from last years's depleted receiving core, but this year he has weapons.  

If Harb was able to get a player with a low ceiling and get him to max out, how far can he take a player with a much greater potential?  Our coaching staff was so clever and amazing with Alex, just imagine what they have in store for Kaep.  They've been game planning for Kaep, they will put him in situations to succeed.   




 Unknown entity?  Our coaching staff watches and scrutinizes these 2 players everyday for the past 2 years, they know the exact weakness and strengths of both.  Now while Kaep might not have the stats all Alex lovers love to spew, he's opening up the playbook Harbs designed to have.  

I got 5 on it saying we'll see a bomb to Moss in the next few weeks, and we'll see different plays we haven't seen all season because we've had to cater to Alex so much.   




 Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.  

However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.   




 He's a little bitch.  Man up and confront, no need to blast people on FB.   




 This dude is a little bitch.  Man up and confront them in person, he's got video.  It's like he wants the attention on FB 




 Mitsuwa hands down is the best in the greater NY area.   




 Oyster sauce is a must. Depending on the type of stir fry, fish sauce is also handy.  And don't be afraid of a tiny bit of sugar, these are all strong salty.   




 Sorry Kenka is junior varsity.  It's mainly izakaya, and those kind of spots don't focus on noodles.  Their draw is the greasy bar food I.e yakitori, pork belly, fried chicken  




 Not sure what ramen joint you had in Japan, but standard tonkotsu is white milky. My exp at Minca didn't have the look or taste of tonkotsu 




 The only drawback is the bar hopping scene on the east side is bleh.   




 couchsurfer, or find a sublet on craigslist 




 You're looking at a 1hr 30-2 hr wait for Ippudo, as well as forking over 17.00 for a bowl.  My wife and I are both fans of Hide-Chan's Hakata Tonkotsu.  It reminds us of ramen joints in Japn 




 Too thick of a broth IMO.  I haven't been to Jin, but have heard good things.  If you haven't had Hide-Chan yet, highly recommend.   




 Redditor for 10 months.  Explains alot.   




 It's not the end, it's a phase.  Explain that from here on out, the decisions she makes is on her.  You did your part, all you can hope for is that she is grateful and can return the favor one day 




 Exactly this, every Alex debate has to have #'s and %s.  Now while that might look sexy to Alexsexuals, we look way more dynamic with kaep.  Even VD raved about how much more zip the ball has when it comes out of kaeps hands.  

Ill give some benefit of the doubt to Alex last year bc of the depleted receiving core, but no excuse for this years giants game.  3 int's, and that's with suped up WR's.  I think our play book was at half max bc we had to cater to Alex.  People forget how dope our coaching staff is that put Alex in situations to succeed.  Guarantee Randy Moss is gonna have 70 yd bomb from Colin soon.   




 So all you guys think Harbs and the staff aren't competent enough to game plan against that?  Because essentially, when you're dissing kaep saying defenses will know how to game plan, we won't be able counter attack.  Please explain 




 And the same argument can be made for Brady, so don't categorize all the time  




 Don't even bother, the Alexsexuals love down voting any mention or praise of kaep.
