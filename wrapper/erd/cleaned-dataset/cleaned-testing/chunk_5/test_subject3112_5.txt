 I honestly don't know how to pick a name for what I'm feeling.  I'm certain I'm straight gray-a (I feel pretty much no sexual attraction, but I can feel romantically attracted), either that or my libido is just perfectly shot.  But I feel fine with the thought of never having sex-- or do I?  

This is going to sound perfectly ordinary, but I only get off to gay porn or fanfic.  The part that I ponder over is why I feel like I would be better off as a gay dude.  I'm not transexual-- at least I don't think I am.  Aren't they usually pretty sure about it?  I never minded being a girl.  

One thing of note is I find pregnancy personally abhorrent; the thought of *myself* being pregnant literally fills me with disgust.  I think it might be considered a phobia of sorts.  I don't think it is the cause of my asexuality, but it might be a contributor.  Even before all of that realization though, I never had an interest in dating while I was still in junior high/high school.  I couldn't understand why girls oogled at guys, I thought, 'sure that guy looks attractive, but why are you losing your shit over it?'  I literally gave no fucks.  It was only later after my second boyfriend, I realized I cannot feel sexual attraction (if I have, it was very temporary), and that I am probably asexual due to the fact that I just get disgusted with myself when it comes to the sex part.  I messed around with non penetration stuff, but ultimately it got to the point where it felt disgusting.  And I never actually felt connected when I was involved sexually with my boyfriend, despite how I felt toward him romantically.  Like, I removed myself mentally from the situation pretty much while it was happening.

Then I started thinking, and I just realized: you know, I'm pretty, but I've never really felt comfortable in my own skin, and not by an 'I'm ugly' standpoint, but mentally.  I just... don't feel like I belong in my body.  It's not overwhelming or persistent, I don't even feel like I would be strictly *male*, just... that I don't feel like either gender?  Male is the best fit maybe, but I don't mind being female.  It's just, there's this quiet and unnerving sort of feeling that something is wrong.  It's been there even since I was a little kid.  I don't mind being asexual and never having sex, but the part I do mind is likely being alone forever because of that.  

I dunno, am I weird?  Sorry for this unstructured rambling.  Feel free to ask questions if anything has confused you.  I wouldn't think any of you are weird ever, it's just that experiencing this for myself is so very confusing and stressful and sad at the worst of times...   




 Fuck, if the [notice board](http://www.neopets.com/noticeboard.phtml) was still in working order I'd tell you to spend a couple mil to put up a notice at the top.  IMO that would be the best way to get someone's attention at this point  xD  But that's incredibly unconventional and silly.  What else is there to do?  It'd be better than a ticket, since it's not on-site related and Rico S. just closes them anyway...
