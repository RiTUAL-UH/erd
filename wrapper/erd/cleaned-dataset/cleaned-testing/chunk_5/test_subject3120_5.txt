 I would avoid it.  Consider that most stores need to make at least a 25% mark up to cover overhead costs...they are probably selling it at slightly over their cost (around $150), the distributor (who also needs to make at least 25%) probably paid about $75 for it (plus shipping and import fees).   




 not free...someone had to pay for that.  they probably got credit from the manufacturer 




 Pretty cool...the only problem with this is there's no option to search by new releases or by year released

 OP did you read the redacted report?  Nothing in there about Obama 









 Here's the report:

 Heroin is made from poppies which grow in Afghanistan.  Here's a website that describes how it is made: http://opiophilia.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-heroin-is-made.html

You can't have heroin without poppies.  Sure you make make similar drugs in the laboratory, but they are very expensive and require government subsidies to support production and distribution.

Would it make sense to go to the places where poppies are grown and destroy the farms that grow them?  That or regulate their production and sale? 









 I'm wondering why nobody has dealt with the source?  Poppies?  Poppy farms?  




 weird.  It opened for me.

 Gosh...don't know what to say.  I suppose it depends on where and how you use it.  I've found it very useful for conversations with my darling wife and her family.  I don't use it often in public, except when dealing with service (restaurants, taxis, stewards, shop keepers).  Mostly when we're in Korea my wife does the shopping though. 




 when people already fervently believe that the world economy is controlled by lizard people  actual lizard people  do you really need to spend the time proving that they cant detect when theyre being mocked? 




 Time to switch to Android 




 Oh lookie!  Gloat is at it again! 









 It's pathetic.  You'd think they would come up with something more interesting to say 














 asshole 




 I hope they ban you.  Not only are you a moron, but you're an english one too 




 The anti-vaxxers are everywhere 














 fuck you and the horse you rode in on 




 um, I was?  leaving this shitty subreddit anyway 




 because it's a challenge for wow veterans 









 There's nothing new in wow actually. 




 Hmm...I'd say there's a lot of skill involved as you can't take advantage of gear.  You have to rely on your wits and your skill. 




 mocking you for being a moron.  you probably believe in the rapture also 




 Not in my state. 




 I'm not a paid poster 




 I'm not interested in mounts, gear or "treasure".  I'm motivated by leveling perks and gold.

Once you hit 100, there's nothing more to do except farm/auction which is really boring

I can't tell you how many times I've hit 100, deleted my toon and started over. 




 I honestly don't care about flying vs no-flying.  WOD is no more exciting than any other part of WOW.  And there is plenty of flying elsewhere.  Sure it would make it easier to do everything, but then that's cheating really.

Here's a challenge for you: try to level a toon without special armor or magic items to 100!

Do it now 




 My supervisor?  Not sure what you're referring to.  Anyway, I live and work in Massachusetts.  Vaccinations are required by law for public space use and schools.

I'm sorry you don't have kids.  They change everything, especially perspective! 




 Because she's hot? 




 As a doctor and a medic, if you don't vaccinate your children you are doing more harm than good. 




 So you're saying that what Israel did before is not the past now?  Doesn't make sense.

Anyway what do you care what Israel is doing? 




 Why would you post something like this on TIL?  It's obviously not confirmed by anyone or anything, so it goes against the rules of that subreddit 




 Dunno...something like this I suppose http://www.schs.ws/schs2/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/map_native_american.gif 




 Whale watching or go to the beach and walk the length of it (can take several hours - bring a knapsack for things you collect and some water).

Mass Audubon also has a reservation in Wellfleet that's pretty awesome...nice trails for hiking, a boardwalk, also a beach area.

Not a lot of "shopping" to do per se, unless you're into cheap knicknacks you can buy just about anywhere

 I played with my youngest daughter for the last 7 years.  She's married and has a 2 year old now.  I suppose I'm paying the monthly fee in case she wants to come back.

I also roll new toons once a month or so, run them up to 100 and delete them...it relaxes me 




 This morning I rolled a priest.  I'm at level 35 today.  I'm playing him naked, greeding on everything and selling.  So far, I've made 321 gold 




 Only race bait if I were baiting my own race which is kind of silly 




 My eldest son works for the commonwealth of Mass. as a civil engineer.  He said that most people are corrupt, inept and dishonest.  He said people just want to pull a pay check and go home to their video games and beer.

There's no conspiracy.  It's just that most people are lazy and self centered.  Most of the "evil" in the world is either someone being lazy (or a bunch of people institutionally lazy), or corrupt/self-centered. 




 They are fixing this in the patch.  No flying for you! 




 Psyop.  None of this is true.  it doesn't even depend on where you live any more.  The reason we're hearing more stories about bad things happening around the world is because the internet is becoming more available than ever before...that's a good thing. 




 I am half black and half mexican, so I think I can post whatever I want.  

Also, I see these people in the ER every day.  They have free insurance, are uneducated and keep coming back time after time for silly things like cuts, bruises, headaches, sniffles... 




 GLOAT, BLOAT, MOAT, STOAT,  














 What information did I post that was false?  You have to have 100 comment karma before you can vote.  That is true. 




 And the follow up: http://www.amren.com/ar/pdfs/2009/200907ar.pdf 














 There are other discussion forums online where you don't have to have karma to participate.  I just don't see the point of Voat if it's only there to compete with Reddit 




 I figured that much.  I enjoy reading your posts, though.  Please let me know when your book comes out.  You do sound a lot like Robert Steele.  I know you're not him.  I suspect you're a lot younger, possibly 1/3 of his age even.   









 Give the folks at Arcadia a call...I'm sure they will know better than anyone 




 I think these changes have been made to attract the new kind of player we're getting lately, which seems to care more about "items/gear" than game play.  I think Blizz is not catering to you and the way you play any more.  They see that this new generation of players is willing to shell out $30-$60 for items in addition to paying a monthly fee.  It's the new cash cow for Blizz.  They'll be including items in Diablo next if they haven't already.

 Honestly I don't really care.  I kill off my level 100s anyway and start over with new toons. 




 Looks like a spot near my sister-in-law's home in Seoul...within walking distance of her apartment actually.  Can't remember the name of it 




 I've read all of your comments and submissions and you don't support any of your (wild) claims with evidence or references.  Care to explain why? 




 because it made me shudder looking at it?  I get that feeling you get when you rub an eraser on something smooth like glass...druuh druuh druuh 




 Do you have evidence or proof of any of this, or are you just making shit up? 




 Reddit is not run by an evil corporation.  It's run by [Conde Nast](https://www.condenast.com/).  They own Wired among other publications.  Hardly evil. 




 Hardly.  It's just becoming more and more corporate.  Not dying at all 




 You're talking shit.  You can say anything you want on reddit.   




 You can say anything you want on reddit.  Just create your own subreddit and say away!

 Voat is useless.  "You can't vote on Voat".  I call it "Gloat" because once anybody has something evil to say about Reddit, then everybody talks about "voat" like it's some special place.  It's not.  You have to have 100 "comment karma" before you can vote.  And that's only one of the reasons why I won't use it. 




 When is all this doom supposed to happen?  And I thought you were leaving the country? 














 The nutrage lady embarrassed her family and the company, a lot of Koreans felt embarrassed also.  My wife of 29 years did not feel this woman represents Koreans in any way.  She said this kind of attitude is not how Korean women behave and should not be taken that way.

Sending her to prison for a temper tantrum was pretty silly.  









 honestly if you care so much about the way reddit used to be, why don't you create your own site and invite people to join it?  I'll join.  Just don't create some arbitrary rules limiting use of the site like GLOAT did 



















 Obviously we're in the minority.  I feel this man is full of shit and as bad as any of the others

 That that wow is so fucking boring, I've becoming a troll tank.  It's a lot more fun than I thought.  I que as a paladin tank, then create huge pulls whilst shielded.  Then when everybody wipes, I release and stand at the entrance until they kick me. 




 I remember hours of fun porting people in using my warlock.  Now that spell is useless 









 Nothing new here.  If you're into this stuff, check out Bishop Accountability http://bishopaccountability.org 




 Happy to see my senators stayed away from this (MA) 




 I don't like raids (too many people running around, no leaders, no fun) and don't see the point of achievements 




 It used to be fun to quest and do dungeon runs.  Now it's super easy to quest, the loot is mediocre and the more advanced levels only have a few dungeons.

Also, part of the fun was getting to the dungeon.  Now you can just port in, do the dungeon, and get out.  Random dungeons don't have any teamwork any more.  In fact, the tank is usually ignored by dps and often not healed any more. 

Well, I guess it's a new game.  2006 was what, 9 years ago?  There's a new generation of players now and they're not the same...don't have the same gaming ethic. 




 I listen to it because it's the only talk radio station in my area that comes through clearly on my car radio.  I think it's entertaining, sort of.  The ads crack me up.  One time they had a psychic on and were asking her questions like "can you find my wallet" and shit like that 




 I listen to him.  I think he's a joke, thus entertaining. 




 Welp, I've been playing since 2006.  I used to play with my daughter, who has moved on to Elder Scrolls.  We used to quest together and it was fun.  I never got into raiding or heirlooms or anything like that.   




 Because it really sucks right now 









 um, who the fuck cares?  reddit never was anything more than a news aggragator

 how about a tl;dr?  I'm driving 




 I think he's Robert Steele.  Their writing style is identical 




 Tried it...maybe my computer's too slow?  I found it very annoying 




 WOW has gotten cringeworthy - the lowby levels (below 70) are easy-peasey, so children are playing them.  And, yeah, they act like children.  The upper levels (70+ are yawn-inspiring.  5 dungeons per area, the quests are annoying and the loot is insipid).  Honestly don't know why I bother playing that game any more.

Guild Wars 2 is slightly better, but you can't explore the unlocked regions, there are no boats to explore the seas, and there are no mounts, so if you're into exploring, as I am, you're SOOL

 




 Where's Robert Steele when you need him? 




 Wha was the story he was working on? 




 So what?  Who the fuck cares? 









 You write like Robert Steele. Are you sure you're not him? 




 Robert Steele LOL 




 fake tits are fake 




 You sure it has nothing to do with their tiny dicks? 














 I'm too old.  I really don't care.  I've got 2 more years till retirement, then I don't plan on living much past my 80th birthday, which is in about 17 years or so...

Regardless of what has been said here, and elsewhere, I live in one of the richest parts of the country (Massachusetts) and I don't see any of this "element" discussed here near where I live.  We are quite prosperous, thank you.  And I have the grandchildren to prove it! 




 Robert, is that you? 




 reddit can bite me 




 I ignored temptation to try drugs in high school and graduated top of my class.  Was drafted to fight in Vietnam War.  Went as a medic, went to medical school up on completion of tour.  Worked at busiest hospital in Seoul in the 1970s.  Married, had 3 kids.  Still married 29 years later.  We have several grandkids
