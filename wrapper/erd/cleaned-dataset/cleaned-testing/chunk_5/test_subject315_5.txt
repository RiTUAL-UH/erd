 No. 




 Find your local MA or NA meetings and go to them. You can't do this by yourself, no addict can.  




 Fact: most people are idiots.  




 You can't handle the truth. 




 Prediction: This movie is going to bomb because people are going to think this is a superhero film and be utterly disappointed.  




 The Detroit Lions hired my middle school bully as a weight and conditioning coach. I cursed him back then and the curse shall remain with him and everything he touches until his death.  




 If you die from this...good riddance.  




 He's gonna get so laid.  




 He fucking hanged himself. He is no role model, he is a coward. 
EDIT: Was a coward 




 ewwwww 




 Southeast Michigander here. We import out water from the Toledo system so yay... 




 ....and it is totally shit. What a fucking retarded show.  




 Let's trivialize police brutality for internetz points! Fucking white kids.  




 I hate this pose. The foot looks all crunched and weird.  




 ...and I think that it would be the perfect way to end the series. I would be satisfied.  




 I feel a movie is not necessary. Didn't we play the game? 




 We feed a great deal of that "wasted" food to pigs, which in turn gives us yummy bacon.  




 And how does Robert Jordan's death factor in here? Authors are not living analogies of each other.  









 More flaunting. My point is made.  




 If you breed dogs you are a bad person for that choice. If you support dog breeders you are a bad person for that choice. Just because people are happy about what they do doesn't make them good people. My words aren't going to make the bad people go away, but I can point out your flaunting your evil in the faces of reddit users. And you really can only claim ignorance on my behalf when all the humane societies close down due to lack of homeless animals.  




 You can't type your way out of this or point your finger at anyone but yourself when you open your home to a bred dog. What you have done is a moral travesty and you support a community of evil.  




 We could spend all day Googling shit to support our sides...but the big difference lies in the fact that I don't have an immoral action to defend. This is telling in itself. You are not made a good person because some people may support you.   




 Your bred dog is the living representation of a homeless dog put to sleep for a choice you made.  




 Let me rephrase: Breeding dogs is a moral travesty. Every dog bred means another dog dead.   




 Then you are a piece of shit human being. 




 Breeding dogs for profit is a moral travesty,  period.  




 Go to hell, dog breeder. There are dogs at the humane society that need homes. 




 Yay another future-full-of-dirty-scrap-metal movie 




 yay another dude-turned-around-looking-at-shit poster 




 Nope...still old'n'nasty 




 Download the Marijuana Anonymous app and find your local meeting... do it today.  




 Fuckin nasty 




 fucking gross. Gross! 




 Read "In the Buddha's Words - An Anthology of Discourses From the Pali Canon - Bhikkhu Bodhi" 




 Blah blah blah rehash, blah blah blah clerks, blah blah blah 90's. Go away Kevin Smith, you're boring now.  




 Holy fuck she got ugly 




 Why are people so afraid to move their sleeping cats? I'm always shoving them out of the way with my foot in bed and I constantly have to push them off of tables, counter tops, and my laptop. They don't give a fuck why should you? Just move the damn cat!

Anyone who claims to be oppressed by a sleeping cat should not own a cat.  




 You might when you realize how narcissistic he is. It's a book of lies. 




 I read half of it but eventually got sick of the guy talking about himself. Very colorful descriptions of India though. Gives you some insight into their culture.  




 I agree, they are not the best. Change it! Whoever you are.... 




 So what is your end-game? In your mind can a school that does not need improvement even exist? What will make you satisfied, or is it that you're telling us we should never be satisfied with the free educational services our children receive.  




 Are you telling me what I should want? I'm a Democrat, but your liberal use of the word "improvement" leaves a lot to be desired in my case. I am a satisfied parent that takes my kids to a school I love. 
 




 Both my kids go to a Michigan charter school and I am very happy with it. So basically I hope nothing changes.  




 Oh wow I wonder if Wal-Mart can afford it.... 




 A hammer is a lethal weapon. Nails can be, too. Pull your head out of your ass.  




 Big fucKing deal 




 This is....puerile.  




 I was getting ready to rage because for some reason I expected a Delorean bastardized with Monster logos. 




 Did you turn into Yoda towards the end there?  




 Crikey! 




 Like Photoshop 




 Too bad all that beauty is wasted on lesbains. Praise jeebus! 




 Wow. Very nice 




 Wow she looks like Anne of the Thousand Days 




 My girlfriend and I attempted to watch "Olympus has Fallen" and ended up turning it off after 30 mins or so. It was just a bunch of mean people shooting screaming people (from what I remember) and it wasn't fun for us.  




 Oy, that's a heifer that is.  




 She's got a tight little body. Totally a cougar. 









 Whothafuck? 




 My Grandpa took me to see "Con Air" with Nicolas Cage. It was also my first introduction to Steve Buscemi and John Malkovich. 




 Everything mammalian is surprisingly relative in some way. For instance the average breath volume for land mammals is about 6-8 mL per kg of ideal body mass. 

EDIT:ideal
 




 But it seemed rather automatic, programmed to only move when I was shooting, like the gun's trigger was the gas pedal. It was fucking trippy.  




 So I was playing an online session and I had a pretty hefty wanted level. All of a sudden a zentorno (I think) with no driver appears out of nowhere and I am able to get in the passenger seat. It only starts moving if I actively trying to defend myself from the police using a gun from the passenger seat. And it always moves in the direction  away from the police officers and eventually I'm able to remove my wanted level...I think. I died before I was able to find out and I've never seen the ghost-getaway car again. Is this a thing?  Was I tripping? 




 Shitty potato cam lights 




 IMO Jansport's are just as flimsy you cheap, talented bastard.  




 Who? 




 Black? 




 No actually those are painted bats. Stop raping the language.  




 Shocked that an old person died or shocked that nobody has heard of this really old person? To me you should not be shocked by either considering this is a computer machine. 




 Isn't that like the risk you take if you are a military vehicle? 




 The sad part is I went into this movie totally prepared to be weirded out and this part was just too weird for me.  




 I sort of lost it when he was having virtual sex with her. It was stupid and downhill after that.  









 I'm so sick of seeing Emma Stone's pug-ugly face in movies. I'll skip this one just not to hear her talk. 




 Talk about getting fired up. 




 I'm getting a little sick of Chris Pratt. I feel like his career is the product of focus groups. 




 Those are some disgusting feet. Jesus what is wrong with you people? 




 Show us your tits already. 




 Suspend yourself in the disbelief. I think you are doing it right because you really are not supposed to like Piper all that much. Have you watched the second season?  




 Considering Japan can't have a military... 




 Just shut the fuck up already. The guy makes movies with similar artistic styles... woop de doo! 




 She's cutting the circulation off to her toes with those fucking stupid shoes.  




 Show us your tits already 




 Yeah, Texas doesn't count.  




 This bullshit simply doesnt happen in gun-friendly states. Thankfully I live in Michigan. 




 I am starting to get my 9 year old daughter into comics and she is showing an interest in drawing them as well. What would you suggest I do to stoke her creative fire?  




 The first time I ever heard about you was when I listened to LoveLines with you and Dr. Drew way back in the day. 




 LPT: buy some fucking sunglasses and use your goddamn windshield visors.  




 Jesus its a fucking trailer....would you like the whole movie? I swear people just love to spoil things for themselves.  




 I heard somewhere (im too lazy to link right now....someone do it for me please) that it was because the harsh winter killed off their usual prey of wild animals. 




 If you are a mammal, might I suggest doing daily tick checks. They are everywhere. 




 The Grand Budapest Hotel

I was amazed, I was glued to my seat, and I was very impressed with the acting. I cried when it was over knowing that something this beautiful graces the big screen only a few times during my generation.  




 Your kid is a pussy. Tell him to nut up and grow a pair. 




 Stop everything! A rich and famous person is hurt!  




 First and foremost: improve your English.  




 Eh, they's knobby. 




 Those are some weird lookin toes 




 Some of that frustration results from the fact that we feel we should be able to tell the person how to spend the money once we hand it over, like the money is still yours even though you've given it away, which is not the case. Money, once given, belongs to the recipient. You should feel happier that you made someone's day easier. And if they spend it on drugs or beer, that is their right as a human being.  




 I love how this thread turned from hating on selfish bitches to proclaiming what an awesome society we are in general by not helping those in need with a buck or two, or a handful of spare change from our pockets. Poverty is a real problem that real people suffer from. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.  




 You would need a predator to find that out.... 














 No Emily, what are you doing? You have best feet in hollywood, take off those feet ruining high heels! 




 You think that matters? Ha. 




 FUCK YEAH  




 FUCK YEAH A LIFETIME OF DEBT AND DESPAIR 




 But if we all did this then we wouldn't get to leave snappy notes for our roomates! 




 Make up your mind already so they know if you're going to hell or not. 




 Maybe don't try be like them and wear symbolic jewelry. You just validate them by trying to be like them. 




 Self-promoting bullshit. Fancy fondant-covered slabs of sugar bread are a phase of this generation,  and when the fad dies your business will most likely follow.  




 The other dude doesnt get upset...there is no cringe here, maybe just a slight misunderstanding between buddies.  




 That bird has a parasite that makes it seem so "friendly." Seriously, kill it.  




 I think that grin is a result of bad teeth or lack thereof. I agree that the dumbass cabbie is totally at fault for believing a dude with jacked-up teeth.  




 Fuck this sterotyping meme.  




 Bullshit sentence, he should be senrenced longer to max security. This sixteen-year-old PERSON held someone at gunpoint. He deserves to have the book thrown at him. Once you decide to hold someone at gunpoint, you aren't a kid anymore, you are an adult who should face all the consequences of one.  




 Ewww 




 Gross feet-ruining high heels 




 Big deal. I mean...its a really big deal.  




 More religion, more problems 









 Goddamn I feel sorry for the bloke that has to windex those 




 Do it yourself. Google Earth or something.  




 Yep, she has reached the limit. That baby face looks too creepy on her body now. 




 Wut 




 Probably some weird Asian thingy or whatnot.  




 Thanks science, for letting all the poachers in the world know where to go for a sea turtle free-for-all in international waters.  




 It's a travesty nonetheless. Comparing the two and saying one "ain't so bad" is evidence of injustice and of a society run by propoganda machines. You are getting sucked into it, pal, and are becoming part of the problem. Both ways are wrong. It is wrong to even have forum for knee-jerking verdicts until this case is decided in court but America fucked that up a long, long time ago and now we breed people who have no idea what justice really is outside of what Hollywood rams down their throats.  




 You can't compare the two ways of social injustice as being similar or different. You aren't right by being less wrong.  




 I feel like she would be more popular if her last name wasn't panty-hair.
