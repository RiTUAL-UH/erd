 It's easy to say "just go with it, get lost in the moment," whatever, but sometimes we feel self-conscious without meaning to, and get stuck there, like a centipede thinking about its feet. In those moments it'd be nice to have some ideas to fall back on. 

The insistence that you should always "just know" what do to in bed needs to die a quick and painful death. If it really worked that way, no one would need to ask for advice.

 I assumed he intended "this is more about what I as the guy like to see" in the context of "I like this because then I can tell my partner is enjoying what I'm doing, which means I'm doing it the way she likes it." At least that's what I'd have meant, because that's the whole point of the act for me. 




 "Tell me more" is way too underrated.

 "That's the lecture. Are there any speeches thinly disguised as questions?" 




 If you can't wait till morning, PCL this late probably has a couple of quiet empty corners, especially along the east wall; there's some secluded chairs back there. I saw a guy a few hours ago napping on some chairs he'd pushed together. Some of the group study rooms should be empty, too.

During the day, first choice is /u/bste2015's suggestion of the SSB's relaxation room. The study rooms at PCL may be full, but it's worth checking. 

Third floor of the Union has some comfortable chairs in a hallway by the east windows. It's not exactly private, but it's nice and quiet and nobody bothers you. 




 Awful choice of method. I have no idea why she did it that way. 




 Speaking of insecure passwords, here's a story I sent to [Computer Stupidities](http://www.rinkworks.com/stupid/) years ago. I'll just paste it here:

My workplace just switched to a Microsoft Exchange mail server. As part of the switch they went around to everyone's PC and installed MS Outlook and some other networking gizmos.

They gave everyone the same email password and put the word out that passwords wouldn't be changing for 45 days.

Everyone. Has. The. Same. Password. And everyone knows what it is.

They did this ON PURPOSE.  




 You don't know what her own pain was like. Telling someone they have to keep bearing their burden so we don't feel bad is the true selfishness. 




 Itself. 




 I used to do sports massage, and for several years I joined a team that worked with the western Missouri MS150 team at the overnight stop. It was one of my favorite things all year. Great people, great fun, great event. 




 Would have been even easier if you'd ridden the bike instead of carrying it.

Seriously, way to go. Great achievement. 




 So you can toolbar while you toolbar. 




 Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas.

You know he knows just exactly what the facts is.

 "Be yourself" is incomplete and confusing advice. A good, full version would be "Be true to yourself," which is more liberating. So if you want to talk to someone, you'd like them to feel at ease so they will engage you, and to do that, you put on a pleasant expression, for instance. You may not feel particularly good in the moment, but you truly want to enjoy their company, and thus you want them to enjoy yours. If you overdo it to the point you're just putting on a false front, that's another thing. 

Same with saying pleasant things even if you're not feeling good or charitable; you want the other person to hear what you're saying, really hear it and understand it, so you do what you can to say it in a way they'll listen to. Your instinct may be to say, for instance, "That's fucking bullshit," but you also know that the other person will just get defensive and dismiss your opinion, and that's not what you want.^1 If you say "Are you sure? What about ..." or some such, then your message will get through. You're working harder but being truer to yourself.

^1 (unless it is, in which case go for it) 




 You can benefit from the good small stuff, but not from the bad small stuff, so it holds together.  




 Sorry, my fault. 




 Not me, but at my last workplace I was told of a fellow who used a remote desktop from home to access porn through someone's computer at work. I have no idea why he went to all the trouble. But he forgot to close and delete everything when he was done, and the next day the coworker came in, turned on her computer, and screamed so loud they heard it two blocks away. The perp was fired as soon as they figured out it was him. 




 I'll be sure to say hi to your mom. 




 More like 100% in most cases. The take from the concession stand is the only money the theater makes. 

And as was mentioned earlier, they've done enough research to find the price points that maximize their profits there, and a crucial factor is that you can't go somewhere else.  




 Violence can be used for punishment and retribution, which are good things. Nudity and sex are pleasurable and rewarding, which are bad things. 




 You did dis?

...

I did dis. 




 Not all the big names do that, and TE is the biggest name and he does it every time. Just sayin'. 




 That's where I've seen him too. It's amazing how he finishes his official sets and then goes out into the campgrounds looking for more opportunities to play. 




 Here's how I once heard someone introduce him:

How many guitar players does it take to change a light bulb? Ten -- one to change the bulb and nine to say "I could do that." Unless the one changing the bulb is Tommy Emmanuel; then the other nine go home to practice. 




 There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it. 




 And then along came Jones! 




 Well surely there was *some* fuck all. 




 An apple every 8 hours keeps 3 doctors away. 




 I had a similar question, and this answered it. Thanks! 




 I sometimes say "That made a lot more sense in my head." 




 I'm not very good at boyfriending. 




 He's been around for some time, but he's not as much of a character. 




 The 2 is NOT a loser here. In fact, this particular suit is difficult to assess, because the number of spades you will lose depends on how the opponents' spades are distributed. If they each have 2, you can play the AK and collect them all and have no losers. If one opponent has Qxx, though, the Queen will take a trick, because after you win the AK the Queen will be the highest spade, and it will win one trick. (If the opponent who plays after the Jxxxx hand has QT98, then you have two losers. That's a distant possibility.)

Note that in each case, after you play the AK and, if necessary, play a third round to make them take their Queen, the rest of the spades are winners, not losers.

Remember that counting losers is only useful in a *suit* contract, because as soon as you're out of a suit, the next time the opponents play it you can win the trick by trumping. You can only do this if you have trump, though, so it's most useful to count losers in the hand with the longer trump holding.

So a loser is any card in a suit in the long-trump hand that you will have to lose before you can start trumping. So if your diamonds are Axx opposite Kxx, you know you can win the A and K, but you have to lose the third trick before you can trump their diamond plays, because you have to follow suit three times before you can use your trump.

So, sometimes (as with Axx opposite Kxx) you can count your losers in a suit right away, and sometimes (as with AKxxx opposite Jxxxx) you won't know for sure until you find out how the opps' cards are distributed. 




 I knew a pair of twins in high school, and there were subtle differences in how they dressed. I could always tell them apart if I saw them together, but if I saw just one I was never sure. 




 I call this condition CDH, and it's basically why I never took up drawing. 




 Thanks for the correction; for some reason my hazy memory was that Leo was talking to Margaret. I fixed the comment above. 




 Just an off-the-wall idea, but what if you occasionally went out to eat with the *specific intent* that he would order something healthy from the menu? It sounds as if he's in a habit where waiter+menu = crap food. Once he's said "I'll have the salmon salad" in that situation a few times, and had a tasty meal as a result, maybe it'll be easier when he's at a working lunch? Just a wild thought. 




 The seeds for compulsive overeating are often sown in childhood even if the problem doesn't manifest till later. Most parents use unhealthy foods as rewards (be a good boy/girl and you'll get ice cream), so eating junk and the endorphins that follow become associated with happy feelings.  




 Indeed. I like to quote Leo McGarry from *The West Wing* describing his alcoholism, when someone asks why even one drink is too much. "I don't want a drink. I want ten drinks."

Edit: Detail corrected. 




 It's partly the specific foods and partly the context: Using food to get those feelings unrelated to nutrition. Somewhere I saw a study that said addiction doesn't happen unless you go through all of these stages: Use, stop using, feel withdrawal, use to ease withdrawal feelings. Soon you get used to using those endorphins to deal with other kinds of stress.

I sometimes go back to something a friend told me, about someone he know who worked in an auto body shop, where they use paints that do bad things to your brain when you inhale their vapor. He'd drink heavily after work every day, and if you asked about it he'd say, "After a day with those chemicals I'm fucked up. Drinking is a fucked-up I can deal with."

Same with overeating. I've sometimes counted myself lucky that at least I eat instead of drinking to deal with stress, but that's just less bad, not good. 




 The story goes that Oswald Jacoby could look at his hand, unsorted, then put it in his shirt pocket and draw out the cards one at a time at his turn to play, without peeking. 




 There had been suspicions about this pair, so one of their opponents was watching for unusual actions. He noticed that they were coughing in ways and at times that didn't seem natural, so he made notes when they coughed until the session was over. Then some smart people figured out what the code was. Look on bridgewinners.com for Eddie Wold's post about the matter, he was the one who caught them. 




 "I'm running away from home, but I'm not allowed to cross the street." 




 I used to work for a newspaper in a metropolitan area. Once the top editor called all of us in the newsroom together to explain that times were tough and we wouldn't be getting raises on schedule, and we'd have to cut back on expenses. I stood up and asked why we had just flown five reporters and three photographers 850 miles away for a basketball game. I was pleasantly surprised how many of my fellow rank-and-filers came up later and thanked me for saying it. 




 I had to do this same thing once. Poor little snake. That was years ago, and I still tear up thinking about it. 




 Dress for the job you want ... 




 Thanks. It's a bit late for me (I'm almost a PhD in the social sciences now), but it sounds like good advice, and maybe some of the younger folks here will find it useful. Agreed about needing physical analogs for the math.  




 Reading books (including e-ink readers such as old-style Kindles) has a physically different effect on the brain from anything involving a computer or TV screen. It has to do with the areas of the brain that get stimulated by the light. 

If you're bound and determined to waste the same amount of time with hard-copy reading as you did with computer futzing, you could do it, but it won't come as naturally as chasing the electronic glow. 




 I read somewhere that White's slight advantage is just enough that with perfect play White should win. But as has been noted, the game has not been solved, so it's still speculation. 




 I've played bridge (the card game) for some time, and this is a factor when bad players play good players, *but* the good players still come out ahead overall, because the luck of the clueless comes into play less often than skill vs. skill. Put another way, a high-variance strategy (essentially, not knowing what to do) may work now and then, but not in the long run. 




 To expand on /u/ihadacatonce's answer, basically any game that includes randomness. Any card game, backgammon, etc. 

One top poker player has a complex approach based on game theory and high-level math, and he says that you could still beat him even if you don't outplay him. 




 This is basically why I didn't go into physics; I need to have some sort of physical analogy in my head for these things. (It might have helped if I'd had an explanation like yours way back in high school.) I was pretty good at the math, but the more abstract it all got, the less I wanted to continue. 




 Optometrists can; they're fully fledged medical doctors, [says here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometrist). Opthalmologists are MDs, so no question there.
