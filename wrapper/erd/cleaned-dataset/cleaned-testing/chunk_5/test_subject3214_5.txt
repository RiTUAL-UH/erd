 Thank you! She was really the main event, I was just there to make her look good :) 




 The company my girlfriend works for uses a great costume shop in town that has any kind of garment for a costume that you'd ever need. The pants had an MC Hammer-esque crotch though, so squatting down to get on the kids' eye level definitely had a risk of seam splitting.  














 It's actually in Spotsylvania, Virginia but otherwise spot on :) 




 Yea the Pittsburgh interview was when Frank planned the implosion. In Chapter 10 @8:40 Peter and Frank have a heated discussion where Peter tells Frank he isn't afraid of him anymore. The Watershed Bill failed and his people need the jobs he promised them and Frank had better fix it.

The next scene is Doug and Frank discussing accelerating their unspecified plan. Peter's confidence has been built up and they're losing control of him. It's time to put him away. This is the plan to have Rachel seduce Doug the night before a radio interview and get him drunk after being sober for so long. So Frank schedules the interview and tells Peter to be ready and to go to this gala the night before. There, Rachel works her magic at the hotel, and boom goes the dynamite. 

Killing Peter was really just a spur of the moment decision by Frank. When they're in the garage, Peter is drunkenly babbling on about needing to come clean about everything that's happened. Well Frank can't have that. Peter wasn't supposed to be a liability after he withdrew from the Governor's race, but clearly he'll always be a thorn in his side. So how do we deal with a perpetual Peter problem? You put him down. Politics.  




 More than anything it helped Frank look like he genuinely wanted Peter to win. Frank was the big name in the leadership who backed Peter from the get go and with the Majority Whip and his wife working so closely with him on this bill and getting it passed, people would think, "Oh wow, Underwood really believes in Russo. He really wants him to win." And as the New York Times reporter reminded us, Peter didn't have much experience backing legislation, so this would help with that. But when the bill failed, it made Peter look like less of the contender Frank wanted him to be. Fortunately, it wasn't that big of a bump in the plan. 

In Chapter 11, after Russo gave Doug the slip at the hotel, Frank chides Doug for taking his eye off of Peter. "There was a plan here, Doug. He explodes, he withdraws, we put him back together, then he quietly goes away." (@24:00).

Frank wanted Peter to look like a major contender and then once Frank orchestrates the implosion he can be like, "It's really such a shame, myself and the leadership really believed in him." Then the leadership is scrambling for a new option for Governor and Frank ever so conveniently has and idea: "Let's send Jim Matthews back to Pennsylvania, he could definitely win with only weeks before the election. Well now we need a new VP. Hmmmm... I wonder who we should choose..."

Plan executed. 8/10. -2 for Peter's sloppy "going away."
