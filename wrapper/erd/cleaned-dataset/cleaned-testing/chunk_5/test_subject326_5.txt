 When I had my son they had to go HUNT DOWN the doctor... an hour after my epi wore off and the nurse couldn't do anything. That sorry bald man was in the breakroom! I spent an extra hour in labor for him to eat pizza and watch tv. Whats up with these sorry doctors nowadays? honestly, OP you have all rights to be in the room with your wife. Kick his ass if he steps outta line the slightest bit! 




 Oh wow. Your writing style is amazing OP! Being from the south too (GA) I appreciate your beautiful imagery. There's nothing quite like the south. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I really do hope you can come to peace with it yourself (I know that's going to take some time). I'd like to think she found peace before that final plunge. I was almost taken by the currents at Myrtle Beach when I was 13 during a youth trip with the church. I was dragged a mile down the shoreline, and luckily I caught a break in the current (like how between two there's a calm spot?) and was able to get back to shore. I wasn't in too far, but I was just out of touching range and apparently not a strong enough swimmer for those currents. They only had yellow flags out that day. I'd hate to think what may have happened if I'd ventured out there during red flags. There were no lifeguards posted.
