 Close. Am I speaking with a fellow Fall Branchian? 




 I was waiting for you. Glad you could make it.  




 Bristol Motor Speedway is definitely an interesting sight to see in these parts.  




 Definitely worth it. Good luck to ya. Maybe one day you'll be a fellow East Tennessean. 




 Fall is definitely one of the most beautiful times of year around here.  




 I love it. I've lived in several parts of the country as my dad was in the military and when he retired we moved here.  None of the places weve lived in can compare to East Tennessee.  Depending on where you live you have the best of both city life and country life. Southern hospitality isn't a myth, everyone treats you better here. It's a great place to live. And actually I just transferred to Middle Tennessee State University last year so I'm right here outside of Nashville when school is in session. I think choosing to live between the two places would definitely depend on several factors but if you want the option to have a quiet secluded life (with a view) East Tennessee is the place. Also,  not that I'm saying your life has to be secluded in a place like East Tennessee, because it doesn't. You just have that option if you want it. Hope that helps!  




 Oh yes, you must come back when there is not a festival going on. There are so many less people and you can see the town in its true form.  




 I'll notice you by your driving first and then the Illinois license plate. 




 My favorite place in Ashville is the Biltmore Mansion. The view from the back of that place is amazing not to mention the house itself.
