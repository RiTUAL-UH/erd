 * Chrome and Firefox security i feel is almost at par with each other.  They both get owned at Pwn2Own and every other contest, so its just evolution. Multiprocess(Electrolysis) is coming to Firefox soon.    
* Chrome is quite ahead on HTML5 support true, but Google has a lot of "only works on chrome" going that will hurt the open web for the future. Google being in a more dominant position also tries to make switch which is in their favor at times (eg. recent HTML5 switch on YouTube - Media Source Extensions )  
* UI customization. Hands down. Nobody comes close to Firefox.
* I think Firefox also wins here with the support of Firefox Sync, and it is cross-platform(iOS version coming soon). But each to his own.  
* Privacy - Cant stress this enough to matter because people just DON'T want to value it; Went you get Chrome from Google, there is and always will be some form of Privacy trade off.   
Firefox is for pro-privacy and supports DO NOT TRACK tech. Chrome is just a blind NO to this question. 
Mozilla doesn't want your data but Google will surely want it some how.    
* READER MODE! :D (i love this on android now, will come soon to Desktop)  
* Extension support - I personally feel Firefox rules this (maybe the fanboy in me)  
* Firefox on Top of the [Browser GrandPrix](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534-12.html).  2013 yes - didn't find a new one :( .  
Also beat chrome out on [benchmarks](http://arewefastyet.com/) - Lower is better.  
* Personally hate the new "Works on Chrome" or "works on webkit" views. If you're a dev YOU SHOULD ensure your site works everywhere. Another reason i stick to Non-Webkit browsers.  

EDIT - Chrome is Tetsuo aka RAM hog :(  
As for "apps" on Firefox - https://marketplace.firefox.com/ 




 Button's a clean driver. Alonso gets real aggressive once he finds a sweet spot. 




 after staying in the 11th floor of a building in Pune with little-no coverage; i had enough with airtel! 




 BSNL 3g speed is good! I was kinda surprised when it touched 1000kbs while i was in Andhra. Went to a forest reserve recently and only BSNL had coverage there too. 
I like Docomo too; they have better 2g speed that the rest 




 Nope, it's a separate company, they only use the search part and ands protection layers over it so that everything is encrypted and not tracked.  




 "toll-free"*  
*-Introductory offer. Subject to market conditions 




 you dont have to go directly to google - look into https://startpage.com/ ;) 




 look into https://startpage.com/ ;) 




 Alonso should never be blamed for switching teams; its his life and he had to turn it around; being second best is nothing in this sport where winner takes it all.  
It was Frustrating as a Ferrari fan to see ferrari not deliver for many years in a row. Im now happy that Ferrari is doing something and i wish Alonso's future also brightens up 




 apple's apps and the apps using internet is a very different thing. Surprised he cant see that stark difference. 




 Flipkart maybe be run by Indians in India, but works out of Singapore  









 pipelight or the original crap flash from Adouche 




 i do understand that part; everybody is competing, i just hope some miracle happens to McLaren 




 im hoping for a reverse BrawnGP :'(
 




  I just can't see Honda get their act together. 

They've been catching up seconds; they have finally started completing a race. Its hard to play catch-up when you've been out of f1 for long. Matter of time.
 




 i think McLaren has a chance to go to the top; Ferrari was trailing far behind from the Mercs until the safety car came;  
The only champion car on the grid is the Merc and every thing else doesn't matter, Alonso saying if they(Ferrari) are not on the top, his move was fine, seems alright to me now.  

disclosure: Ferrari Fan(even though i support Alonso) 




 you need the proper Gstreamer 0.10   1.0 version codecs for h264 to work properly 




 you sir are awesome! 




 It certainly is possible, you just need the right color palette.   
Digital Painting isn't that bad with gimp. Once you get a hang of the brushes and brush settings your work flow will be smoother.   
Path tool can help you with sharp edges or strokes.  
Also use layers, definitely helps and saves time on mistakes.   

If you're trying to Make something of the face mash thing like the images you posted, know how to cut out images properly. Use layers, set warmth tones, use curves, blur and clone tool. 

Edit - combine multiple software like krita, mypaint and Gimp, you'll finish much faster  




 yup! they have to pay for this!

 i did file a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968) on this, nothing has happened so far though :(  
Still happens on my Stock 5.0.2 lollipop Moto G at times, after consistently browsing for some time. Most reproducible when i repeatedly use the search fields of some sites.(more crash prone in private browsing mode)

 




 That article is shitting people with that bunch of links 




 There's an option in the setting's to get the enter key long pressed for emojis 




 lower is better for all.  
You can choose the different systems under "Machines"  
 




 ah nope not everywhere http://arewefastyet.com/ 




 Snoop Using Linux OS;  
The foot icon belongs to GNOME - an Open-source Desktop Environment - the most common/default on most Linux distros 




 You would have like it better if you had watched it in the theater though; i saw the IMAX and non-IMAX version, and i must say IMAX is truly miles ahead. Its very immersive when you get the IMAX scenes, and the sound/music shakes up everything!   




 linux :'( 




 get ublock. its highly efficient, OSS, and light on memory compared to others 




 scrolls pretty well for me 




 its on nightly and aurora firefox 




 ah i've had this at times, reduced when i switched from a Micromax to Moto G, please do contribute to this bug with info/logcat etc. - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968 




 cough cough http://www.ghacks.net/2015/03/31/firefox-37-find-out-what-is-new/  
WebM support will be on its way soon now :) 




 yes you can https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-up-firefox-sync 




 Its coming soon! If you want to try it out get the Nightly Versions ;) 




 i like it a lot, personally.  
Its improved a *hell lot* from where it started.  
Yeah there maybe a couple of bugs here and there, but its been a good experience overall :)  
For me - uBlock, themes, Firefox Sync, privacy and a neat UI - cant ask for anything more. 









 i guess you could use "ifup"/"ifdown" 




 I feel bad for both kimi and alonso. Both of them have hard quite a rough time for a long time now.  




   no technology can locate a phone that is switched off.

NSA does this; its possible. 




 yes please do; Worst part is most Indians don't bother about Political/Law situation unless they are bought onto the their TV screens. By the time they act it will be too late. 




  My BP is rising after reading each question.  

So per minute call charges; Customer Care charges(treat you like shit too); Monthly Data Packs charges(when internet is actually cheaper tech); No HD voice calls(except DoCoMo); Poor connectivity, Roaming charges etc.  
And out of the world profit for them - OKAY  
Nil R D - OKAY  
Next - separate per app plans! - OKAY   

Same; its a monopoly draft that's been prepared.  
I really don't understand these folks. How much money do you want to eat?  
 




 yes please do! 









 Fernando Alonso resembles Che Guvera :D 




 Why don't you try some other project like pipelight or so. They run on the latest flash version. See if that helps  














 IIRC it refers to the situation in the Tie Fighter game  




 Why is this not on the Front PAGE? :O   
ITS AWESOME! 









 Ah I'm on nightly 

What im saying is without MSE, the playback with HTML5 video playback on Linux is bad, stuttering. With MSE it is better(but yeah bugs are present). 




 For me Man of steel - the mythology part was just perfect(Everything about it) _/\_  
The suit was good, cast was good, but the destruction oh god(but yeah it gives him reason).  
I felt in lacking in the depth with Supes and the Villain.  
BUT I LOVED IT :D

EDIT - Yes! im coming back to type this - HANS ZIMMER - BRILLIANT SCORE(gives you a feeling of supes anytime you listen to it)  
ok bye! 




 Does look like emoji, you'll need to get the right fonts for your particular OS. 




 i was on Infinality for a while, Switched to Freetype later.  
I wasn't able to stick to a specific rendering style for long xD 




 Still no luck:  
MIME Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2"  
DASH: no(18)  

Just to clarify, tried this out on a fresh profile.  
I only have the top 3 box's (HTMLVideoElement, H.264, WebM VP8) enabled on the YouTube HTML5 page and the rest disabled. MSE disabled by default.  
If i do enable MSE then vp9 kick's in most of the time, but it currently has A/V sync issue's among others which let the devs to disable MSE on Linux. 




  onts still seemed somewhat blurry). I didn't know about Infinality, I'll have to try it one of these days. The fact that it includes "Windows" presets seems to be promising.

yeah i think Infinality is better for your use(has Mac styles too).  
Im on Freetype though, serves me the best :) 




 chrome used a technique called *Head fake* to give you an illusion of speed.   
Undoubtedly, this has been adopted by others too.  
http://www.computerworld.com/article/2519182/desktop-apps/mozilla-designer-touts-tricks-to-give-firefox-the-illusion-of-speed.html

Edit - word 




  I can put Firefox on Linux and Windows side-by-side, and the one that hurts my eyes is not on Windows.  

Please do try out freetype-freeworld or Infinality(there's nothing better than this in the world)   
[Freetype](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/)

  ou should confirm what codec YouTube is using for the video you watch.

For me its always - avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2 and it feels horrible :'( 




 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 




 ah yes, saw this, i just wish basic support is added to gnome-release for now.
Edit - looks like very little activity there 




 sorry for your time! didnt understand properly first time. 




 oh okay, understood it wrong.
Thanks for correcting me 




 ah! dont know bout that, you'll have to stick to one 




 yup it does! :)

Edit - watch comment below 




 export chrome desktop data - Firefox  
Use Firefox sync for cross platform sync. 




 Also long press a video and 'Open with App'  and choose vlc - perfection  




 I'm not sure. I haven't reported one.  
Hoping this issue on the radar.  




 I've got gstreamer 0.1 and v1 both installed.(hopefully believe I have the right packages)  
Firefox should mention somewhere on the help what all packages are needed for a user.  

And everything is at default, YouTube html5 shows a tick mark on h264. Mse disabled.  




 h.264 is bad on Linux :(
No Smooth buffering, and playback stops at times. 




 I had something similar while closing tabs, but I had filed a bug report and it was resolved.  
Are you on the latest version of Firefox? If yes and this continues to persist better file a bug report.  




 Yup it is.  




 They have to use what apple provides, nothing much from the outside 




 Felt the same. I think because few people use Yahoo, their page-ranking system is bonkers. But its quite decent for day to day use :) 




 Second this. Should be mentioned on the Play Store itself. 




 People do use it, emoji became an article on [OMGUbuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/11/see-install-use-emoji-symbols-ubuntu-linux)  
hmm...wish i knew how its done and understand other peoples code 




 Ah im not sure if this is gonna help you, but with bumblebee installed and running, you could use "optirun -b auto nvidia-settings -c :8" to activate nvidia-settings and create specific Application Profiles.  

Other option could be to use the Nvidia proprietary drivers(incase you're still on nouveau).  
In PowerMizer set to Max Performance.  

Also check out these guides, might help you:
http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/docs/CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf  
http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Installing-Nvidia-CUDA-on-Ubuntu-14-04-for-Linux-GPU-Computing  

Hope you find a solution! 




 i think your app should be able to use GPU when needed automatically.  
Maybe if your look around you could set some parameter/command to permanently run the app with a GPU. Or the Nvidia Settings Manager could be of help.  
As far as i know the battery drains as fast as the usage. When your hooked to the power port, it just lets current pass through, nothing more i feel.   




 well since you've turned off optimus, your power consumption has shot up. Your only other way around is to disable the GPU In BIOS if it does support such a feature.  
Me currently using bumblebee and its your best shot for proper power management. I think its better than the nvidia-prime thing.  
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
 




 okay, i dont understand a thing on that page. :/  
Im gonna quietly wait for this. :'( 




 There's lots open source emoji projects like [EmojiOne](http://emojione.com/) but none have made into the Linux Desktop.    
Every other OS now has support for color emoji's and emoji input as well.  
Why's it taking so long? Emoji has gone mainstream and is used a lot these days.

EDIT - passwords are still WIP - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=589589 




 Yup Everything will be like a new firefox!  




 if you card is Optimus based, i think you should definitely use [Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/); it takes care of power management very well. 




 Yes! Create a separate profile - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles  
Now. Enjoy. 




 awesome :D 




 It is!
Maybe just check the menu and see the  settings of your addons if it's enabled  




 Synfig  




 Firefox + ublock addon will help you!  




 Firefox sync provides sync capabilities  across platforms.   
Install the hangouts plug-in. I use it, works pretty good  









 time based sort should be extended individual albums 









 Since MSE is disabled on the Linux Nightlies, i've been served video's on YouTube with the codec "avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2" but the playback is extremely choppy and stalls every now and then.  
Other than enabling MSE(which i currently avoid due to A/V sync issue); anyone know what could be the trouble or a fix for it?

EDIT - also no DASH support 




 Check these tools - http://www.nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html 




 Maybe F3 is the alternative key for you. Im not sure why Ctrl+F isnt working out, but its fine for me on my Fedora. Try checking out in Gnome Setting - Keyboard - Shortcuts 




 Giant title bar - get HTitle addon  




 Triangle - Very Unique 




 recommend you to create a fresh separate profile for nightly 




 ah well depends, sometimes the updates in Nightly are small 3-4MB or 7-10MB.  
You get the 45MB+ updates when you haven't updated for a few days time.

EDIT - yes mostly once a day, unless something of critical importance breaks(quite rare) 




 Is your system a Dell/Asus? They use something similar to that name for updates or something(if im not wrong) 




 i think you need to reset your browser:  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings  

Or create a new profile(Backup - data first!):  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles   




 i use beta, wasn't working on beta. Thank You for the info :) 




 I remember trying out Chrome when it launched, its was good then, but i continued using FF.  
After a while i started reading about all the amazing headfake techniques chrome uses(like faster animations) to make people believe its faster. Once android came, i knew Chrome would rise to a peak and so much control to a corporate wasn't good i felt.  
And NSA happened too.  

Stuck with Firefox all these years(From version 1.3 or 1.5) and i still love this browser! I hope once they launch the iOS version soon, Mozilla will get a better hold of the mobile market, and also if they launch on Windows Phone it will be a win too. 




 Had a canvas 2, i used it for 2 years, pretty good phone, even though it was big.  Somehow adjusted and got used to the size. I gave up on them when no sources were released and no further OS updates by Micromax. Also a horrible Service center experience.  

Switched to the Moto G 2ng Gen. (2014).  
Its well designed, has the same screen size of 5 inches like the Canvas 2 but the curved back, the thinner screen edge bezels, super comfortable to hold and with a feel-good material Motorola has won me over completely.  
Also Brilliant Hardware performace and Awesome reliability on Software Update and love for almost-Stock Android experience.   




 Thank God this is being addressed(Voted!), browsing unknown sites on mobile is a pain with all the ads auto opening in new tabs and random downloads.
