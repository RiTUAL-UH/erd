 Didn't see it today, but it's pretty darn common to have military helicopters flying in and out of the Pentagon. I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's any scoop to be had-just another day near the Pentagon. 




 Thanks, dcpanthersfan. I feel a bit annoyed to have been lied to, but I'm glad you saved me from calling the County Government to inquire about it and looking silly. (And I'm glad that people can go to A-SPAN for free.) 




 I was at a Giant in Arlington tonight, and a woman was panhandling asking for $2 so she could stay in a winter homeless shelter in the Courthouse neighborhood. I gave her the $2, but I'm wondering if homeless shelters really charge for people to stay there? (I've heard a panhandler near the Pentagon City Mall make that claim as well.)

I'd find it unsettling, to put it mildly, if there is really a charge to stay in local shelters, particularly when it is so cold outside. (I'd also find it strange, given that local governments around here frown upon panhandling.) 




 Ordinarily, federal workers have staggered schedules. Between gliding schedules, compressed schedules, and other changes, people get to work anywhere between 7-10ish and leave anywhere between 3:30-6:30ish.

Have everyone come in today for a handful of hours and then all leave at the same time, and you end up with the metro so full, people are at risk of being pushed onto the tracks, and complete gridlocked streets, just as the weather conditions start deteriorating.

Perhaps unscheduled telework/leave, followed by early dismissal would have cut out enough people from coming in to the office to avert a Commutageddon 2.0, but since Commutageddon in 2011, OPM has made a conscientious effort to put the safety of employees first, even if at times, they end up overreacting to a bust forecast. (See http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/commutageddon-a-year-later-would-the-same-fiasco-repeat/2012/01/26/gIQAhzgKTQ_blog.html) 




 It's like the cursed yogurt in the Simpsons. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_pqnsKWlpc t=0m30s

We'll be updating the dinosaur exhibit at the Smithsonian so it'll be scientifically accurate according to today's understanding of paleontology, instead of being a fossilized relic depicting the 1930s understanding of, well, fossilized relics. *That's good!*

It'll require the dinosaur exhibit be closed for five years. *That's bad.*

That time will allow the museum to dismantle, clean, and remount the dinosaur to be more accurate. *That's good!*

But in the process, there will inevitably be breakage and other damage to the dinosaurs. *That's bad.*

While the process is ongoing, there are still a zillion other free Smithsonian museums to explore, and there are other neat exhibits at the Natural History Museum besides fossil hall. *That's good!*

But none will satisfy the kids who are really into dinosaurs. *Can I go now?* 




 Happened to my 2011 17" Macbook Pro yesterday. Thankfully, it's still under AppleCare for another few weeks. Without warning it shutdown, and when I rebooted up, saw blue and white stripes at the Apple screen and had trouble getting past it. Apple Store is replacing the logic board. 




 *nods* That is really strange. I also went to an Apple store. (Heck, most of the independent mac retail/repair places have gone the way of the dodo, which is a real shame. There used to be a wonderful DC-area independent Apple-authorized repair shop that offered very affordable rentals for repair customers, but it went out of business a few years due to the Apple Store around the corner.) 




 Yep-you were right. It's the GPU. They'll be replacing the logic board, otherwise they would have charged me $525. I'm darn lucky it happened now instead of three weeks from now. 




 Ouch-I'm sorry to hear that! And thanks for the confirmation.

My laptop has never felt as speedy as I thought it should, for the top specs, maxed out RAM, and plenty of hard drive space left. I wonder if the logic board has always been a bit dodgy? 




 Thanks! :-) 




 I was using my 2011 17" Macbook Pro (first with Thunderbolt) and all of a sudden, it shutdown. Upon hitting the power button, I get as far as the Apple logo, but with a strange vertical blue/white lines. [Here's a picture.](http://imgur.com/Pq8qf1f  ) It did not want to progress past this at first, and it was even hesitant to shutdown when holding the power button at this point. It made a noise as if it was powering down, but didn't actually do anything for 2 or 3 tries. I was able to get into it by holding down the option button and selecting the startup drive. But clearly, something isn't right.

Thankfully, it's under AppleCare still for a few weeks, and I will take it in tomorrow, but I'm wondering what the heck this is? My googling leads me to think it might be the GPU gone bad? 




 Bad enough when civil forfeiture is done properly through legal channels. If the Gothamist's reporting on this is correct, I'm genuinely shocked and appalled at the situation. 









 Strange lawsuit. Under NY law, it is legal for women to be topless. Private property owners can prohibit it on their property, but unless there were signs posted or something of that nature, I don't understand how the building owners have a leg to stand on. 









 This point is a bit murky, I suppose. According to the linked article, BMA's records indicated that the painting in question was donated to them in 1937. Other articles seem to indicate, as you noted, that the item was on loan to the museum (but even if it was on loan, it WAS willed to the museum).

Either the museum owned it or it was willed to the museum (and she had passed before the painting was stolen). 




 This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone but the woman who claimed to have gotten it from a flea market and her lawyer. Basic first year property law: nobody can gain good title to stolen property, AKA the Irving principle.

In "The Ballad of Irving", Frank Gallop's classic parody of Lorne Green's "Ringo", the protagonist was Irving, the 142nd fastest gun in the West. One of the versus starts with "141 could draw faster than he, but Irving was looking for 143."

Well, just as with Irving, who would have been dead meat against the 141 fastest gun slingers but could take out #143, an innocent owner of stolen goods might have better title than someone coming along after them. Basic, black letter law. 









 What is the "life lesson" there? That it's okay for employers to screw employees?

 As I said, casual gamer who buys games from Amazon. I haven't been looking at GameStop until recently. 




 I'm just a casual gamer, so, I only buy a few Xbox 360 games a year. I mostly get them from Amazon.com. I recently moved to an area where there's a used game store (a national chain) within walking distance, and thought I'd check out the used price of Grand Theft Auto: V. It's around $55 for a used copy. The store is selling it new for $60. I know full well that across the street, Best Buy is selling it new for $40.

I mentioned to the clerk that they're selling it used for $55 when it's being sold new for $40 across the street, and he just shrugged and seemed uninterested. He certainly didn't make me a better offer.

Looking around, I didn't see any bargain used games. From what I saw, they were all only about $5 less than the new games they sell.

Is this standard for the used game market nowadays? Are these stores traps for the unwary, or is it just my local store? 




 Will do.

 One troubling element is just how much territory the border exception for searches covers100 miles. I've been stopped near White River Junction, Vermont by the Border Patrol for a checkpoint. Not an area I would consider being near the border, by any means.

They looked in my car, asked me and my passengers if we were all U.S. Citizens, and when we nodded, they let us go. I wonder if it would have been quite so easy if everyone in my car wasn't white. 




 I haven't seen anything as absurd as this since the Rakofsky v. Internet case. 




 Actually, I have had an issue with a cab driver driving in the wrong direction and not following my attempts at getting us in the right direction. Reported him to the cab regulators, got a refund and apology from the cab company and the cab driver was suspended. It got to the point where I became concerned for my safety with whereever the cab thought it was going, and I would have demanded to be let out, but we weren't in a great area, and either Uber didn't exist in DC yet or I hadn't heard of it and I was concerned I wouldn't be able to get another cab.

You're right, Gumburcules, DC isn't pleasantville. Getting dropped off in a random part the city isn't a great option. 




 It definitely is unpleasant, but the worst of it is the difficulty of keeping my eyes open so my eye doc can remove the lashes. In order to see the root of the lashes, the doc needs to use the light on the slit lamp. A side effect of distichia is light sensitivity.

I love my current eye doc for her patience and understanding. The first eye doc I found in DC yelled at me for having trouble keeping my eyes open as he shined a bright light in my face. Something that I understand normal people would have a hard time dealing with, and it's a lot worse with light sensitivity. *rueful look* 




 I have it too. It's irksome. Every once in a while, I have to get the double-set of lashes plucked.

 Again? This isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened at the zoo... 




  I can see hypothetical scenarios where people might suffer harm from the breach. Fraud protection replaces losses from debit or credit card fraud (if reported within a certain time period), but if a card is suddenly frozen or canceled due to fraud, it can cause economic harm and other harms to consumers who may find themselves unexpectedly temporarily unable to access funds. Not everyone has cash on hand.

I have yet to see evidence that Target was negligent, but that doesn't mean they weren't. It's early yet. 




 Presumably, any suit would be based on negligence, which in common law requires three things: (1) a duty of care; (2) a breach of said duty; and (3) damages arising from the breach of the duty of care.

I am not your lawyer. I am not giving you any legal advice other than to tell you that if you believe you have been harmed, seek a lawyer.

All I can tell you is that as a consumer who shopped at Target myself in the time period of the data breach using a debit card, at the moment, I have no cause to sue Target. First, there has been no actual harm to me as of yetthere has been no fraud on my card, I have not been blocked from using my funds, etc. Second, I have yet to see evidence that Target was negligent. They may well have been, financial data is supposed to be private afterall, but until more information is available about what the hackers did and how, and what Target could have or should have done to prevent it, it's a little early to conclude that Target was negligent. (I AM angered that for a couple of days, Target was claiming that the anonymous executive cited in the press was wrong and that no PINs were known to be compromised, and today, lo and behold, PINs are known to be compromised. That might be negligence, if people were harmed by hackers using their PINs to drain accounts in the past couple of days, but again, no such stories have hit the press as of yet.)

 **My 5 Questions:**

1. What were your favorite routines or sketches on the Smothers Brothers?
2. Were you surprised when CBS fired you? How did they notify you?
3. Who was your favorite musical act on the show?
4. What gave you the courage and willingness to put controversial, topical subjects on your show? Were you ever tempted to give in to the network's pressure? Did you ever disagree with each other on how hard to push or push back?
5. Tommy, what was it like finally receiving your much-deserved Emmy in 2008?

 I'd some some vegetarian entree ideas. 




 I just left Montgomery County after 8 years and moved to Arlington, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask away. (Plus, I'm now only 20 minutes South of where I was in Bethesda. :P)

If you PM me your email address, I can forward you a guide to DC (with some of my favorite restaurants, things to do, etc.) that I drafted a few months ago when I had 3 or 4 friends moving to the area in the same month. 




 If you're getting a Samsung, you might want to talk to the Big Screen Store people. They price match, extend the warranty, they do delivery, and I think you can pay extra for wall-mounting. 




 Was this back before DC had meters? I know that I used to have trouble getting a cab from downtown to DC to Bethesda, even though I lived 4 minutes over the DC/MD line. It's been a lot better now that they switched from the zone system. 




 Thanks! :-) 




 Thanks! I guess this is the sort of thing they might have told people on October 1st, but rather than make us come in for 15 minutes just to put up away messages and stow files, etc., my boss had my team stow our files the night before and telework on the 1st for 10 minutes, so, yay for not spending more time commuting than working the 1st day of the shutdown, but we might have missed out on some last minute instructions. :P 




 Looking at the news, it seems that there's a possibility the shutdown might be ending soon. *fingers crossed* If the shutdown does indeed end, how will workers be notified that we should go back to work/what is the time frame? Might I got to sleep at 10PM with no official word that a deal is in place, only to wake up at 10AM and log on to CNN.com to find out I should have been at work an hour and a half prior, or will there be a day in between a deal and being called back into service? 




 If I can be forgiven for making a joke without adding anything helpful or substantive to the thread, this sounds like a response to a Whose Line Is It Anyways's Scenes From a Hat prompt.

 Not a mall. The Mall. As in the park between the US Capitol and the Washington Monument. 




 The thing is that this isn't a budget cut. Washington Monument Syndrome applies to discretionary cuts. Here, federal law mandates cessation of all activities that are not directed at imminent threats to people or property. 




 No, no it's not, and it's not Washington Monument Syndrome, Cardine. Washington Monument Syndrome is a real thing, but it applies to cuts in funding to an agency that gives the agency discretion on what to cut. When agencies choose to cut visible, high-profile things in the hopes it draws public attention and leads to cuts being reversed, that's Washington Monument syndrome.

Here, what is funded and what isn't funded is NOT discretionary. It's mandated by the Anti-Deficiency Act, a federal statute that conceivably carries criminal penalties. Nobody has ever been convicted of violating the Act, but agencies have been dinged for it, and prosecution is still possible for violations.

In the event of a lapse in appropriations (AKA a government shutdown), the Act (31 U.S.C.  1342) prohibits continuing to employ personnel in excess of that authorized by law, except for emergencies involving protecting people or property.

So, under the Act, it is allowable to declare park rangers, park police, etc. essential to patrol areas to protect monuments and parks. It's allowable to use such personnel to respond to emergencies and protect people. It is not allowable to use such personnel to keep facilities open.

There was a WMATA (Metro) worker killed on Sunday in a work-related accident in one of the Metro tunnels near Union Station. Ordinarily, the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate the incident. Based on the above part of the Anti-Deficiency Act, however, the agency determined that responding to this incident did not constitute addressing an "imminent threat to the safety of human life..." If there was a known ongoing threat to human life, the NTSB could and would respond, but since the incident had happened and there was no known imminent threat, they could not.

This isn't the Presidential administration trying to inflict pain to rally support. They are following the law. 




 Gabriel Quirk! He's a really nice guy. 




 Moreover, any concession at all would mean the Republicans would demand another concession the next time this fight came up. Six weeks from now. Because the CR the Senate passed is only to fund the government for another six weeks.

Fulfilling a new Republican demand every six weeks would look little different from a Romney/Ryan presidency. There is no way in hell the President can give in to this extortion. 




 Hmm-I'll look into that. Thanks! Mind my asking what a reasonable price is these days? 




 Wow. I had not heard that they'd be dropping that much! (And I suppose I might want to save just in general to buy around the holidays when prices drop overall...) 




 OK, thanks, dr_shamus. :) 




 Is this the Quatron? http://www.costco.com/Sharp-AQUOS-60%22-Class-1080P-120Hz-Edge-Lit-LED-Smart-HDTV-LC60C6500U.product.100037851.html 




 I don't have a Blu Ray player yet, and I don't know if I'd be getting one. I have a lot of DVDs, but I haven't bought one in months, since I've been relying on HD channels or streaming via Netflix or Amazon Prime over buying physical media, so, I'm leaning towards skipping Blu Ray. 




 Hi all. I know that lots of people recommend Panasonic's plasma TVs, but unfortunately, Costco doesn't seem to carry them. I want to go with Costco so I have 90 days to return it if there is a problem, as well as for the extended warranty (Costco tacks 1 year on to the manufacturer's warranty).

This link is pretty representative of what my local Costco has: http://www.costco.com/51-inch-tvs-and-above.html

It's hard judging the quality of the screens in Costco due to the lighting conditions, and solely looking at the specs, I can't tell what's worthwhile. Any recommendations? Would the 55" Vizio (E551D-A0) be a reasonable purchase?

I'm in an apartment that gets a decent amount of sunlight. It has blinds but not blackout shades. I'd primarily be using Fios HD channels and VOD, an XBox 360 (for games), and I have an Apple TV for streaming, so, SmartTV is not essential. I don't know if 3D is particularly essential, either, as I generally prefer 2D movies in theaters. 




 It was a one month extension and it's expired. The original deadline was August 31, and it was extended to Sept. 30th. See http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/capitalcomment/local-news/dc-taxi-drivers-protest-deadline-for-credit-card-readers.php. 




 It's not exactly a vacation. I'm relieved to hear I'll be paid eventually, but that doesn't help pay bills now. Money aside, I can't take this involuntary time off to travel, despite not having seen my folks since December, because this could theoretically be resolved any day. Can't treat it as an opportunity to go galavanting when one can be due at work the morning after at any time. 




 Actually, federal employees may be exempt from the seeking work requirements. They are exempt in DC, at least. "Furloughed federal employees will not be required to obtain job search contacts if they file for unemployment benefits in the District of Columbia." http://does.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/does/page_content/attachments/FAQs-FED%20GovtShutdown%20ONLY-October%202013-FINALv2.pdf 




 What sheriffs do is neatly illustrated by the unusual duties of U.S. Marshals in Washington, DC. Because DC has no sheriff's office and it is not a state, the US Marshals Service has been assigned the functions that a sheriff's office would normally carry out. In DC, serving legal papers is done by private process servers, but if they have difficulty, it's done by US Marshals. In DC, security at the DC (non-federal) courthouse is done by US Marshals, as is prisoner transport. In DC, evictions are supervised by US Marshals. 




 Hell, in 1906, the Supreme Court itself put a sheriff on trial for contemptit was and is the only criminal trial in Supreme Court history. For those interested in this, and it is one heck of an interesting story, I strongly recommend the book "Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism" by Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips. A great read. 




 Um, what on Earth gives you the idea that nobody can arrest a sheriff or that the authority of a sheriff exceeds that of federal law enforcement? Federal law enforcement can most definitely work in a county regardless of the local sheriff's wishesyou need to reread the Supremacy Clause and the line of cases from 1796's *Ware v Hylton*, 3 Dall. 199, to 1816's *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, 14 U.S. 304, to 1859's *Albeman v. Booth*, 62 U.S. 506, to 1958's *Cooper v. Aaron*, 358 U.S. 1, to 1982's *Edgar v. MITE Corp.*, 457 U.S. 624, and there are plenty of other cases out there that make it quite clear that federal statutes trumps state laws, and federal officials exercising this authority trumps state officials.

And federal law enforcement can most certainly arrest a sheriff. Or a mayor. Or a governor. Or any other state or local official. 




 Is it powered by unicorn tears? It sounds rather suspicious to me. 




 A good question, and not one that's easy to answer. Certain parts of the ACA would go into effect regardless, but what is enforced and what is not enforced may depend on whether funding on enforcement is restricted. (AKA, defunding wouldn't stop the Act from requiring insurance companies to follow rules X, Y, and Z, but it might stop the DOJ and HHS from being able to go after insurance companies that follow those rules.) 




 Breathe. 




 Wow-thanks for the gold! :) 




 One of the things the House Republicans attached to some of their continuing resolutions was a clause that would allow employers to opt out of having their employees' health care cover anything they find objectionable. This basically transfers the religious exemption to the coverage mandates of the ACA from just religious organizations to all employers. If you are unfortunate enough to work for a zealot who thinks contraception is wrong, you wouldn't be able get contraception through your employer-based health insurance if that element of the GOP's hostage demand goes through.

(Of course, given how broadly it was worded, people working for a company controlled by a Jehovah's Witness might not be able to get a blood transfusion paid for by their employer-based health insurance. Yay Republicans.) 




 It's not that talking points are bad, it's that they lack details and nuance. The West Wing described the problem with ten word answers really well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dKvletfSo

The transcript of that speech by President Bartlett is this: "Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword. Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high? So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every once in a while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else." 




 Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid did not cover most dental care. Given how difficult it was to just get passed what the ACA does, it wouldn't have been politically possible to expand benefits to include dental care. As you put it, it's extremely costly. 




 Both. That the jobs that are furloughed are referred to as non-essential doesn't mean that they are not important, just that they don't have the potential for having an immediate impact on life or property, the way that a police officer or doctor would, or the staff that ensures Social Security checks go out. 




 I find it appalling that merely 2 weeks after federal law enforcement officers responded to the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, those officers and their colleagues remain on duty but will go unpaid until the shutdown is over. 




 And yet there are many other families of federal employee that rely on income from work performed that will not be paid until the shutdown ends.

Which is not to knock the military or suggest I don't respect and appreciate what they do. But I also respect and appreciate border patrol agents, US Marshals, the FBI, and other federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on a daily basis defending the US. They still work during the shutdown, but won't be paid until the shutdown ends. 




 Most people still have no idea what is in the ACA. That's why you have people like this guy in Kentucky happily signing up for Kynect, the health benefit exchange established by ACA, while saying "This beats Obamacare, I hope." http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/22/kentucky-obamacare_n_3801054.html 




 Democrats are refusing to compromise because they aren't being offered anything. The government operating isn't a Democratic win-it's the way things are supposed to work. It's non-partisan.

Similarly, raising the debt ceiling is also not a Democratic win. It's also non--partisan and the way things are supposed to work.

Republicans are trying to attach all sorts of elements of the Republican platform to these two items. (And note that the continuing resolution to fund the government is only for 6 weeks of funding. It is absurd to suggest Democrats should allow major changes to Obamacare or any other Republican goodie on a bill that allows for only 6 weeks of funding, even if you think that merely funding the government is somehow a Democratic win!) 




 I think it probably would have. Remember, most Members of Congress are multi-millionaires. Their congressional salary is a pittance compared to their investment income. 




 It doesn't have to be with being considered essential, since essential government employees aren't furloughed, but they also won't be paid until the shutdown ends. (They are, however, in a better position than the furloughed employees in that we have no guarantee of backpay whereas they are sure to be paid eventually.) 




 It will still be funded even it a shutdown. It will not be funded if the continuing resolutions offered by the Republican-controlled House was signed into law.

(And note that the continuing resolution is only for 6 weeks. That's right, folks. Republicans are holding government employees hostages, and get to do it all over again a mere six weeks once the shutdown ends. Yay!) 




 Yes. Economists ooh and ah or shriek when the month to month job growth/loss moves 150,000 jobs in either direction in any given month. Currently, around 800,000 government employees are furloughed. That's a pretty damn big impact on the economy. 




 The Kreeger Museum is really neat. It's the private collection (and in the former home) of a former GEICO chairman, and is a fascinating and eclectic mix. Worth the cost. 




 I'm not so sure. Neither side can afford to quickly cave, and there is no compromise that could be reach that wouldn't be seen as a cave. Unless something happens tomorrow, once a shutdown starts, I don't see it ending in just a day or two. 




 In this political climate, I don't see how we can get retroactive pay. The constituents of those pushing us into a shutdown are hardly likely to be thrilled with their Congresspeople if they let us get paid for no work (even if the lack of being able to work was not our choice). 









 In the end, most people are going to put a case on it, so you can't tell what color it is anyway. 




 I hear the line at DC area Apple Stores was huge yesterday. I got to the downtown Verizon Store at 7AM, was the 9th person in line, and an hour later, they started letting people in to the store 9 people at a time. Didn't get much easier/better than that. 




 Every federal employee has given their fingerprints to the government. Nearly every unpaid college or post-grad federal intern has given their fingerprints to the government. Every law enforcement related officer have given their fingerprints to the government. Most licensed security guards, PIs, etc. have given their fingerprints to the government. Nearly everyone working with kids, from schoolbus drivers to teachers to administrators to after school people have given their fingerprints to the government. Everyone who used the now mostly defunct Registered Traveler systems (like CLEAR) gave their fingerprints AND retina scans to the government. Every person arrested has given their fingerprints to the government. 

TL;DR point 1: Government already has a zillion fingerprints, so who give a damn if they can get more?

Point 2: Buying an iPhone 5s is optional. Using a fingerprint in lieu of a passcode on an iPhone 5s is also optional. Let people make their own choices. 




 Frederick is lovely, but if those commute times are acceptable, one might as well look at an apartment in Rockville itself. Rockville is, well, 0 minutes to Rockville, and it's also about an hour to Baltimore (more with rush hour, but you probably can schedule seeing friends around rush hour). Rockville is 15 minutes from DC and is WMATA-accessible via the Red Line.

The big "but" (no Principal Skinner jokes, please!) is that you probably won't find a townhouse for that. You can probably find a decent apartment for the 1600 range though, including pet-friendly apartments with dog parks. 




 I'll second Georgetown Bagelry. The bagels are delicious, the staff and the owner (Mary) are really nice people, and the pricing is reasonable. What's not to love?

I'm moving from Bethesda to Arlington, and easy access to Georgetown Bagelry is what I'll miss most. (Not to hijack the thread, but if anyone knows of a decent source of bagels, for the love of Pete, tell me! Tell me!) 




 Take Canal Road/M street towards the Key Bridge as an example. There's an intersection at the Whitehurst Freeway where people get stuck in the intersection all the time. Not because they are doing anything wrong, but because drivers up ahead suddenly stop and put on their turn signal to merge into the left-most lane that goes straight on Canal Road/M street, blocking the green light for the middle lane that goes right onto Key Bridge.

Someone can have two green lights in front of them, traffic moving, and all of a sudden, everyone gets stuck because of a car(s) blocking the lane. That's an example of an intersection in DC where one can get stuck in the middle of the intersection and have it not be their fault. 




 Sometimes in DC, one gets stuck blocking the intersection when traffic jams up ahead without warning. Yes, one isn't supposed to block the box. One also isn't supposed to treat a green light like a stop sign.

At least with a speeding camera or a red light camera, someone is doing something against the law that is within their control. When a police officer pulls over a crosswalk encroacher, he has theoretically observed the traffic conditions at the time. A camera aimed at crosswalk encroachers, on the other hand, can easily pick up drivers who got stuck without being at fault. 




 It would make a lot more sense to have given Harry Potter books to local homeless shelters with a high kid/adolescent population instead of throwing them in a dumpster. 




 I'd like to see a 60 minute made for TV movie version of Walter Miller's novelette The Darfstellar. (It's not long enough to make it a full Silver Screen movie.) 




 Well howdy, neighbor!

I agree. A more rationale solution is to cut class sizes, and I think alumni want them to do it to tighten admissions standards. I don't think we're at all happy about the drop in the rankings, not that rankings are the end all, be all, but the slide hasn't been good.

Still, if they aren't willing to cut classes and want to at least maintain them, a new building is a good idea, and you might as well build with extra capacity.

The buses usually will say Blue Route (Main Campus/Metro) or Red Route (WCL/Metro). The shuttle bus that goes to WCL does indeed park across the street from the Metro, whereas the Blue shuttle to Main Campus parks on the same side of the street as the stop. 




 I'm listening to it right now and enjoying it so far. :-) (One of you is apparently my neighbor in N. Bethesda-I'm currently in Bethesda!)

As a current WCL LL.M. student and WCL JD alum, I'd like to respond to what you said about WCL's new building by noting that WCL has already outgrown its current building, just in terms of finding enough classrooms. 

In my LL.M. program, I've wound up in lousy classroom spaces I never saw as a JD student-classrooms where there isn't enough room to have a laptop and casebook in front of you simultaneously without putting one in your lap, and classrooms where several students' won't be able to see either of the whiteboards in the room without turning around.

More space is needed just for the numbers as they are now. 




 Seems like a good idea. It's centrally located for a lot of commuters who'd like to pick up something from a big box store on their way home. 




 I wonder if the guy is linked to the ex-real estate broker in this Consumerist story from July 2012: http://consumerist.com/2012/07/13/colorado-family-kept-out-of-own-home-for-8-months-by-squatters-claiming-adverse-possession/ 




 Agreed. I'm a WCL JD grad and current LL.M. student there, and it's a great school with great professors. I started the J.D. program back when its rank with pretty much on part with UMD (I had gotten into both).

I am appalled at the idea of increasing the study body. I think we need to reduce the number of students from their current levels to improve our rankings and employment statistics. Increasing them seems like lunacy.

But for strong clinical programs and for the strength of our professors, I definitely agree that WCL easily contends with other area schools. 




 Tell that to Maryland Judge Robert Nalley. No, not because he has heard cases involving letting air out of a tire, because he committed the offense, plead guilty, and was hit with a $500 fine and 6 months probation. He also was suspended from his duties without pay for five days.
