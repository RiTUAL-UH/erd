 This sounds really grim. Your best bet is to find a new job because even when you get promoted, there will another issue for the next promotion. This company sounds culturally broken with poor incentives. 

The other issue is that your manager might just not be honest with you. Managers, especially in technology who don't have a ton of managerial experience, sometimes don't know how to give feedback, and so will tell employees that they are doing great work when they might not be.  This might not be the case with you, but you should try and get feedback from multiple sources. If your output is indeed double and high quality, find a new company.  




 The kindle is so much easier to read and much lighter. I am amazed OP reads eBooks on Macbook Pro. Thats really hard ergonomically. 

One option is to use the "night" options on apps. e.g. Instapaper ad others come with a "night" mode where they turn the background black and the text white. I find that a lot easier to read.  




 What about Dick? 
























 A lot of police harassment doesn't happen with speeding or traffic violations but with simple things like broken tail-lights, or expired registration tags. Sadly a self-driving car is unlikely to be a self-fixing one.  




 you mean Donald :) 




 You seem like you have a ton of solid operating experience. I would imagine that if you study finance, you could perhaps translate that into an operating role at a larger company and build a career from there. 

If you really like programming, you could get a software degree but without a lot of programming experience, it may be hard to get a great software job and your experience doesn't really back it up.

Perhaps after the finance degree you could look at a startup role where you can blend your operating and software skill sets better but with the limited info here, my take would be to get a degree in finance / econ.

 I agree. I once watched a movie about the invention of the windshield wiper (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054588/) 2 hrs of my life I won't get back. Not all heroic stories need film adaptations.  














 Avoid it but always be really nice and have a really good relationship with all the assistants. Thats the fastest way gossip spreads and they are surprisingly influential. Be really nice to everyone but especially them (which in the stress of the workplace people sometimes forget to do), and it will make your life a ton easier.   




 This list has great ideas. A few more:
quantitative modeler
Data developer
Data analytics
Marketing science
Predictive modeler

In fact searching for "data science" often leads people to the wrong results when they are in fact looking for jobs with analytics / statistics. 




 Research using sites like NYbits (not sure where you are looking for but I am sure there are similar sites in other cities). These tell you what prior rents were and complains by former tenants.

Others have captured most of the things to look for. One thing that is a game changer is a dishwasher. You'll be surprised how much easier that makes your life so if you can get a place with a dishwasher - give that props.  



















 Add peri peri salt on anything - from roasted vegetables to roast chicken. 




 Fair point. I wasn't thinking that through. 




 I can foresee a few potential changes:
1. Much more even distribution of humans across the globe as the perils of sea navigation decrease substantially. E.g. North America may have been settled by people from Africa and Asia given that the perils of travel would have been meaningfully reduced

2. Remote island archipelagos would also be meaningfully more settled

3. Titanic would have clearly been a much smaller tragedy, but more importantly, the survival of influential rich aristrocats like JJ Astor could have significantly changed recent business history

4. Coming back to #1, meaningfully more trade that started earlier could have significantly changed culture and food. E.g. ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Greece and Indus Valley may have intermingled more, and survived longer as a result creating more continuous history

Perhaps investment and innovation would be more on naval and sea-faring capabilities and less on terrestrial conquest. This could have political ramifications for sure (more colonization, less inter-country fighting in Europe), but also delay innovations like rail travel and air travel in favor of water based innovations

What I am not sure of is whether this would substantially decrease the historical advantage had by early adopters to agriculture. Would fishing really enjoy a substantial advantage is unclear to me. If it did, you could conceive a situation where coastal fishing economies could balance out the power of agricultural economies. Not sure the implications of that though.  




 You should politely respond with "I really appreciate the offer. I am very keen to take up the internship and work for you, but given that I have to move to do this internship - this will be very hard for me to do with this offer given that this will barely cover my rent". Be very polite and stick to the facts.

Be open to ideas they have. Perhaps they can help get you subsidized accommodation, or can offer you an end of summer bonus if you get an offer. Assuming this is a job you want, they might have other ways to make you whole. 

But only have this conversation if you are fairly sure you are ready to walk away if they don't budge since at the internship level, companies are usually less willing to negotiate.  




 So Annie are you ok? 




 Well there is a lot of things you can do with hands like that! 




 Game of Thrones. That way I can manage the topic four different ways:
1. You've seen the show but haven't read the books???? The books are w-aaay better
2. You've read the books but haven't seen the show???? The storyline is diverging and the show is getting really interesting. Plus boobies
3. You've read the books and seen the show? Isn't it amazing??!! Do you think the Dany will make it to Westeros? 
4. You haven't read the books or watched the show???? Here I'll tell you all about it whether you like it or not

Replace with Hunger Games / Sherlock Holmes / Ender's Game. Lather-rinse-repeat.


EDIT: I am so sorry about the spoiler earlier. I didn't even realize it at at the time. Edited to remove.   




 Exactly. and having a compelling narrative is too often misconstrued as having the right narrative. This mixes badly with peoples inherent biases when talking to someone in a position of power.  




 Not invest it. 10k invested at 5% return per year in 20 years is 25k. In 30 years its 42k. I was lazy for a long time and left any savings I had in cash and didn't even bother putting in a CD or an index-fund or anything, and on hindsight that was the worst thing I did with my money.  




 well done Asoiaf nerd! 




 :) observing your short response, I just know that you are exceedingly smart as well.
