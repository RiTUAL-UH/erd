 Edited, PS4. Sorry my bad lol 




 More like a downgrade then an upgrade 




 Looking for a new guild? Freshly made, Vindictive Vengeance awaits you. We currently reside on the NA servers on ps4 and side with the Aldmeri Dominion. We are a social/pvp guild .currently its just me, but with luck more will come. If youre interested in joining a new guild just out of the guild maker 2000 , then shoot me a message with your psn and you'll get an invite as soon as I get on. 




 Where there is supply there is likely always demand,  unless something better comes along and replaces that supply On a side note is 10k that hard to get? I made about 30-40k from 1-27. And I'm not even at the recommended level for the area where vamps and wolves spawn. Play the game, enjoy the content. Rather then complaining about something so minor. It's a skill tree and a quest. Nothing more, nothing less. I say 10k cause that was the average price on pc, money isn't hard to get, its just time consuming .
EDIT: just realized my first statement doesn't really make a lot of sense, ignore it I suppose
