 As someone who recently went through the whole college application process, that looks a lot more like a rejection letter than an acceptance. The acceptance letters are nice and shiny and professional, and they usually come in huge packets for lots of papers. The rejections are just single unflattering little envelopes.

EDIT: OP follow up, did he get in? 




 Yeah, but he'll probably charge you a ridiculous amount of money for something that should have been free and bore you the whole way through it. In the end, you'll be disappointed with the outcome and vow never to return to the field of dentistry again.

 The day the music died. Him, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens all in a matter of minutes. So sad. 




 As much as I love JFK, he really didn't do much of anything productive as a president. Anything he started either failed or fell to the wayside. And I mean literally almost everything. He also got too personally involved in the Cold War. He was a politician trying to fight a war with the wrong goals and prerogatives in mind. Someone in charge so far outside of his element made the entire conflict a rockier road than it had to be. He really should have just let the people who knew what they were doing make the big decisions. After he was assassinated, a few things he has begun were completed by his successors as he became a martyr, but for the most part, not much went through. A great man, personally one of my favorite historical figures, but a generally overrated president. 




 could have? 




 Jimi Hendrix. Died at 27 (basically founded the 27 club) of asphyxiation. Jimi Hendrix moved to Europe and formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1964. They recorded with each other for about two years all the while traveling around the continent to play with the greats. In 1966 they hit the main stream. And then, almost overnight, Jimi Hendrix became a household name. In the next four years they would play some of the most legendary concerts ever preformed and write some of the greatest songs ever recorded. Even today Hendrix's influence is clearly recognizable in modern day music. He was one of the greatest instrumentalists to ever live. And yet, he was only a mainstream success for four years. Imagine how far he could have gone otherwise. Imagine the what he could have done if he had more time. Gah, makes me sad just to think about. 




 I'm not from the US. I would definitely argue it was an American victory. In the end, the British promised to stop their attempts at native American expansion in Canada and stopped the practice of impressment on American shipping routes. In contrast, the British got almost nothing out of the war. 




 Never heard of the simple syrup thing, I need to remember to try that some time. 




 Woah what's that??

 Surrender might not be the technical term, but it's generally accepted that the British lost the war. 




 It has worked on multiple occasions. 




 Not even close though... 




 The Battle of the Red Cliffs: Emperor Cao Cao's army was exhausted after a series of forces marches and unprepared for battle. Cao Cao did not reguard this and pushed on anyways. After reaching a river, a spy in his army advised Cao Cao to chain his ships together to avoid sea sickness. Upon seeing the ships, the opposing army sent fire boats at the fleet. The ships were trapped and quickly caught fire. This battle marked the end of the Han dynasty.

 nbsp;

Battle of New Orleans: In an attempt to revive the failing British army, General Packenham decided to attack the military stronghold of New Orleans and gain control of the Mississippi River. Andrew Jackson and the American army were well prepared however, and the British were easily repelled. The American army took only a fraction of the losses of the British. To make matters worse, the war was already over. Although word had not reached Louisiana by this time, the Bitish had surrendered long before the attack had even begun.

 nbsp;

Battle of Watling Street: As the Celtic leader Boudicca lead 210,000 tribal warriors south, burning and pillaging along the way, she decided to launch a surprise attack on a small Roman outpost on Watling Street. About 10,000 soldiers were stationed there. The Roman's could literally see the attack coming from miles away and easily out maneuvered the Celts. They began by using crossbows at long range and then setting up a phalanx when the army got closer. In the end, the entire Celtic army turned and ran. The Romans only lost 400 compared to the Celts 80,000. Boudicca committed suicide and the chance of Celtic victory was all but destroyed in a single battle. 




 Not really... I don't know enough about the English language to explain why that would be wrong, but I can identify it.

 Eggnog. I tried it with on who loves it and another whos never had it. We both agreed that this is what we imagined paint tasted like. He said it was bad eggnog, but regardless it ruined it for me.  




 You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.

EDIT 2: Andddddd one more. A friend of mine last year informed me that Google Chrome won the Kentucky Derby. Yup. An internet browser won the world's most prestigious horse race. I mean I guess I get where he got that...but still. 




 Can I get a TL;DR on that? 




 0 Minute War!

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War 




 I tried to do this once. Believe it or not, a 100 pound 14 year old didn't have too much authority over a 250 pound 35 year old dad. I was honestly worried he was going to charge me. Then he took two tries to get out of his folding chair and my worry dissipated. 




 I used to ref soccer, hated dealing with this. I was at a game once where a keeper took a goal kick, only to have it immediately intercepted by the other team and shot into the open net. Goal, right? That's what I thought at least, and whistled the play dead before retrieving the ball and walking it back to the center of the field. When I was half way there the coach of the team that was scored on ran up to me and started shouting that "THE GOALIE WASN'T READY, SO THAT DOSNT COUNT! TAKE THEIR POINT AWAY!". I said that's definitely not a rule, and even if it was, if he wasn't ready he shouldn't have made the decision to start the play. These are middle school kids, they know the how the game works. He had no verbal response to that. Instead he grabbed the ball from me and punted it two or three fields away. "Go get the fucking ball, punk" he said. I calmly (and quietly, and very slowly just to piss him off) explained that the home team needed to supply the equipment for each game. Field, nets, etc. And if his team couldn't provide a vital piece of equipment, say a ball, I would have no choice but to have them forfeit the game and give the other team the win. Everyone quietly watching him walk across the entire park to get the soccer ball and bring it back was the most satisfying experience I have ever been a part of.

TL;DR: Made a very reasonable call the coach didn't like, he got mad and punted the soccer ball away and told me to go get it. I told him if he didn't get it and his team, the home team, can't provide the necessary equipment, they're team forfeits and the visitors win. He retrieved it. 




 No, you're actually very wrong.

*Insult: a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action*. Again, and actually serious this time, is English your first language? That would explain a lot. Your definition was a little misguided. It okay though, let's just try steering that brain cell in the right direction, champ. Anyhow, I have not once insulted someone because I wanted to hear them reply, what the hell kind of concept is that? If I'm insulting them, I'm clearly not a huge fan of hearing them speak, so why would I even want them to respond? You for example, I literally could not care less if you respond or not. Literally. The best part is though how you act like you're not trying to come up with some sort of comeback or response. Who was the one who began this whole thing by responding in the first place? Oh, right that would be you. "What have you been doing the whole time?"

And sorry to disappoint pal, but if you think anything you have done, or even can do, by commenting on Reddit is going to make me the least bit angry, you are more than delusional my friend. 




 Awwwwwwwwwww 




 "Man sneezes into tombstone during concert? Woah. Intriguing. Let's watch. Wait what? Is this a church? Well that would explain the tombstone. Wait, come on test_subject3655, whens the last time you saw a grave on the *inside* of a church? Well hold on now test_subject3655, this could be some weird religion where interior burials are common. If Scientology and the Church of the Button can be a thing, well I'll be damned if graveyards with a roof can't be one too. Either way, some guys gonna sneeze in one, they better get to it. 7 seconds to go. Woah, woah, woah hold up. What in the fucking dick was that? Was that an elephant? In the church? Why in the hell wouldn't the title mention the fucking church going elephant?! What is the title anyways?-Holy Jesus Christ I'm in idiot."

EDIT: Watched the video again. Couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed. 




 R+R=L(S)? 




 Please please please post a video of all of this. And then train my dog to do it. But seriously, the first part. 




 How does one exactly laugh at something while not paying attention to it? Do you even think before you type? You got that one lonely brain cell left, use it.

While under normal circumstances it's easy to understand the difference between insults and jokes, yours seem to be the solitary acceptation. I'll tell you what, how about you actually make your jokes *funny* and your insults *offensive*. That way not only will I understand them, but maybe we could even consider what your saying 'coherent'. This might seem like a lot to take in for a person like you, but one step at a time, bud. 




 I literally said out lout, "Holy fucking fuck", even though this isn't even really a theory, it want this theory to be true the most out of all of them. 




 I think if you're already in the car, its too late for you anyways. 




 Is English *your* first language? Because it's  capitalized, genius (I think I should explain that 'blast' for your benefit. I'm calling you a genius sarcastically. That means that I don't really think you're a genius, on the contrary in fact. I'm calling a very stupid person.)

I keep responding no because I care about (but not limited to) your opinion as I think you should probably know by now, but rather to educate your dumb ass. In my own humble opinion, it seems we shouldn't waste the single brain cell you have left. But if you would rather waste it, hey it's your brain cell to 'blast' if you insist upon doing so.

And are you still defending your incredibly messed up sexual assault joke? I stopped reading your little 'retort', and I use the term very lightly, about half way through but was shocked to pick back up and see that you were still at it. It was hard to believe you made a joke like that in the first place, but to sit here and watch you defend these actions... Despicable. I don't care if you find that sort of thing hilarious, but I certainly don't, and I think I speak on behalf of the majority of the general public when I say that so please stop saying things that degree of fucked up. Gosh, it really brings your character into question.

And don't try to explain your joke; it's never funny when you need to explain the joke. Come to think of it, it was never funny in the first place. 




 It really is the trouble makers that get away with the most. 




 Are you really joking about molesting people? And comparing it to an almost harmless joke (I say 'almost' for your benefit. The teacher didn't care, the students thought it was ridiculous. Literally no harm or even unpleasantness that could have come remotely close to coming out of it lasted even the length of that day) someone made on a teacher in middle school?? That's and disrespectful and fucked up on so many levels. And to think your trying to preach righteousness. Unbelievable.

And I'm not trying to prove your weak insult about a 'shit' wrong. I literally could not care less about your opinion. In fact, I'm getting a kick out of watching you still struggling to 'blast' me. ('Blast'?? Seriously? Jesus, how fucking old are you?) 




 The class would just be dying about how far he could go

I did actually. And even if it didn't, you just assumed these things. As we all know, when you assume, you make an ass of 'U and ME'. Or, in this case, just you. So being 'blasted' on basic reading skills is on you. Its funny that you blame me for what you thought was clearing it up later, and then went back to the previous un-cleared up hypothetical scenario you made up in your head. If you didn't get it the first, or second time, I'll say it a third. I nor anyone in that class, have naver made or laughed at a 'borderline stalker joke'. Are you still assuming things?? Read it again, slower this time. Good lord, just get it together. 




 I've got everything under control 




 I had Harrison, a Ford Mustang, Philip Rivers, a Dodge Charger, and 'The Sharp Dressed Car', a Nissan Z. 




 Don't really need to bother with "keys" though, do you?. Its not like you're going to get there and realize you forgot them. 




 Being put on the spot. 




 Well I would be offended, but it just seems plain silly to take egotistical internet ass holes with a superiority complex seriously. For the record, no one thought what he was saying was funny, they thought it was funny that the teacher did nothing about it. Are you honestly saying that you were never a juvenile middle/elementary school student with a slightly distorted sense of humor that probably encompassed some sort of immaturity? If you say no you either missed your entire childhood, or you're a conceited dick. If you say yes, then you should understand why a class of children would find immature things like this funny, and apparently just troll people on the internet because you have nothing better to do with your sad pathetic life. I couldn't care less about your depressing little existence though, carry on making the world a worse place for the rest of us. 




 You're asking the wrong person

 [Well, well, well, how the turn tables- . . .] (http://youtu.be/KdhSxMgpJL8)

Sorry, made me think of the that scene... 




 Um, no. I get why it was seem like that, but I was there, trust me it didn't go down like that. The class would always be dying at how far he could go just walking all over her and when he was done she would laugh along with the class like it was a tiny little joke and no big deal. In reality, he regularly crossed the line and went after her personal life and family. It was hilarious, but so, so wrong.

EDIT: Don't care so much, but why downvotes? 




 [Ahem] (http://youtu.be/JgCHJM2fT2U) 




 There was a kid who would just say some ridiculous shit to this one teacher because he knew he could get away with it and just wanted to see how far it would go. He said things like, "On Christmas Eve, I'm sneaking into you children's bedrooms (she had two infant girls) and painting myself green so I can and hold them as ornaments instead of your Christmas tree" and "In the middle of the night I'm going to climb into your husband, so that when he talks you'll hear *my voice*" (he put some great emphasis on that last part), and even "I went online to 'rentaslave.com' and ordered you a nice new pair. Oh, happy Martin Luther King Day, by the way". Just some weird fucked up shit. The most shocking part though, was her reaction. She never did anything about it. Just laughed politely and said things like, "Alright, now I think that's enough now, John" all the while still smiling courteously like he had just made some chuckle-worthy light hearted jab.

 Okay, so this one is serious. Probably going to get buried, but serious none the less. Can someone (preferably not too huge of a stoner, just to avoid bias) who lives in a state where marijuana has been legalized explain how it has changed things over there and if you're in favor of the changes? And if you partake, how the system works exactly and what it's like compared to going into say, a liquor store. It just seems like such an alien concept living in a state so anti-marijuana.

 James Spader. I like to think of my dog as an evil mastermind meticulously planning out every detail in his elaborate scheme to rid the world of that darn cat across the street. No one can scheme quite like James Spader, he's the perfect embodiment of a sami-evil puppy.

 The entire 'proof' system is not only confusing, but unnecessary. It differs from country to country. In the United States, 2 proof equals 1% alcohol. That means that vodka at say 80 proof is 40% alcohol. There is really no point at all to the system. Encouraging people to do basic math I guess?

To make matters worse, the system changes in each country. What 80 proof means in the US could easily mean something completely different in another country. But in the US, 200 proof is as high as it goes. Thats 100% alcohol. 




 Not all words, just those that are important or relevant to the story. 




 It sorta looks more like he said, "we need to have a talk about boundaries" 




 Literally the highest it could possibly be. 100% alcohol.

 Okay, fine. They contributed the slide. 




 Yeah, I was totally joking about that one... I love Newark, especially downtown, but its by no means a tourist must see. 




 It is, there is just too many people. 




 See at least three Broadway shows (if you're there long enough), the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Central Park, a few museums, the 9/11 memorial/One World Trade Center, Yankee Stadium (not to be confused with Citi Field), the Empire State Building, Bronx Zoo, USS Intrepid, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center, the United Nations Headquarters and maybe the Jacob J. Javits Center if any big thing is in town. 




 New Jersey hosted the Super Bowl last year. New York played no part in that, most people even flew into Newark. 




 You guys have the weirdest sense of humor

What?? I've lived in many places throughout my life, New Jersy among them, and let me set the record straight, the standards of comedy in New Jersey are absolutely no different from the rest of the United States. At all. On top of that, if you didn't see any nice sights, you didn't look hard enough, or at all for that matter. The Delaware Water Gap? New Jersey shoreline? Cape May? Ellis Island? For god's sake, Newark?!? The only people that say New Jersey, or any state for thay matter, is 'ugly' are the ones that are too lazy to step off the parkway (even the parkway though, pretty damn nice down south...). 




 It's English. 




 It went beyond the environment.
