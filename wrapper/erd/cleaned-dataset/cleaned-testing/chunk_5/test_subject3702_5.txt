 Hi all! 

I've been living in the portland area for about a year now and last year it didn't even cross my mind that I might be able to do some winter hunting, coming from New England.

I've heard that black trumpets come up in January? Is there anything else I could keep my eyes open for?

Thanks for any help in advance! 




 basically I was reading through the top comments and saw the discussion of whether Fight Club should or should not be mentioned. It had been mentioned there a few times. And then I sorted "controversial" and saw it a few more times. And so when I had landed on this particular comment I thought to myself "that is so brave." And then I said what was in my heart.

If what is in my heart is worth -3 karma, I'll take it. But just know, I died typing from the heart. 




 dude there was a nickolodeon episode with summer sanders (the one where people got slimed) where a girl had invented just that. 




 did you really use 2000 pounds of sugar? 




 ooh you're going to really popular in a few minutes 




 I'm giving you my karmic support simply for how absurd this sentence is.  




 who even considers the third godfather? 




 so brave 




 I could not agree fucking more. I don't know why people like this movie. It's a terrible garbage film. 




 Oh yeah! I forget about that academy award... Never got why that movie was so popular. 




 hey here's the funny thing:

A little ways up there's some dude that said around the same age his english teacher bought him booze and also sexed him up a few times. 

And all of the comments were like "LOL NICE D000dD," because, you know, it's apparently awesome when female teachers fuck their male students.  




 Lol that's so very very wrong. And HILARIOUS! 




 I laughed too much  




 As a cook, I will absolutely cook your food however you want it. But if you order a $25/30 steak well done, I will think less of whoever is behind that ticket.

It's not so much because you have tastes that are different than my own, but more of a combination of proper technique and also straight logic. 

Because let's be honest, if you're going to order that steak well done, just get a hamburger, no bun with some onions and mushrooms on top. Load it up with A1 and enjoy. 

But also because to me in my esoteric ways, ordering a steak over medium (and even medium is pushing it), is like ordering sushi quality yellowfin tuna cooked entirely through. The tuna is "supposed" to be served seared and black and blue. And arguably that's why you're eating the tuna in the first place. Otherwise, you are eating something prepared incorrectly and probably would enjoy something else more.



 




 what about when Ryan Dunn almost killed you with a golf cart? 




 b-but... That's what h4x0rs do. right? 




 oh sure, you get all the love for pointing this out... But I point out hanged vs hung and everyone shits on me. 




 I really hope this is a game 




 Sweet dude! 




 one of my favorite movies of all time! 




 great, now i have to get those color sperrys 




 wait, what? 




 huh, I've always known both kinds to be called chicken of the woods... interesting! 




 i read that in peter griffin's voice 




 hmm no rings though... could be these guys: [Armillaria tabescens](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria_tabescens.html). But idk, doesn't seem like a good fit.
 




 the picture titled "green fungus" looks like [turkey tail](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/trametes_versicolor.html) perhaps...

the one titled "what is this?" could **maybe** be [scalycap](http://www.mycokey.org/result.shtml?genSpec=Species ID=1707 showList=Result random=27669)

the picture titled "more" looks like old chicken of the woods to me [Laetiporus sulphureus](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/laetiporus_sulphureus.html) 




 could be [Scleroderma bovista](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/scleroderma_bovista.html). 




 throw it up on vimeo! 




 TL;DR heartbreak 




 wow, that description got bizarrely political in the fourth paragraph.  




 It frustrates me that this is not further up with more support. 




 I would probably go insane if I worked in this kitchen. Then I'd probably start sculpting hamburger asses. 




 lol you quit? BULLSHITTTTT 




 In my little experience with this, they are not oysters. You're looking for shelf mushrooms, which will growing out of a tree or some kind of wood, and not have a stem as these do. 




 dude! I'm stealing this so hard. 




 first as tragedy, then as farce 




 you made me tilt my head and go what the hell is-- *waitaminute* 




 I agree with you, even though I feel shitty about that. 




 idk why everyone's downvoting you... It's just your opinion. I've just personally never met somebody who classifies modest mouse as a "one hit wonder." If anything they have two hits, and a fairly thorough following.  




 allow me to attempt a translation:

That looks really good! What are you doing later, girl? 




 I was thinking the same thing. Better camera, more light and a tad bit of better presentation would make all the difference in the world. 




 soft cell 




 I've never met somebody who thinks they are one. 




 I understood this 




 that's just tuesday night 




 you just made me yell "HO SHIT!!!" and then I grabbed my ear 




 eh, he's some dude that wrote this book called Antifragile, which makes a strong case for what you're saying. 




 how many times are we going to link to this? 




 lol did you read what he said? 
the fundamental problem with this thing is that it's impossible for the Lightning plug to pass raw 1080p HDMI as they want you to think it does. It simply doesn't have enough pins. 




 ITT: some people had abusive parents, some people are pussys 




 haha, are you Nassim Taleb trolling people in a /r/programming thread? 




 Indeed. 




 You know what? Everyone is going to downvote me into oblivion for this. But just shut the fuck up with this self righteous bullshit. 

People cheat, it's been happening for a long time. I'm sick of seeing this shit on Reddit like it's some sort of black and white issue.  




 \o 




 Time to become a Buddhist Monk 




 Wait... Do you really think of the POTUS as someone who plays golf on the weekends and has downtime?

I mean, fuck. 




 oh my god. Thank you. I may have just ruined some important things by spitting beer everywhere. But it was worth it! 




 no more medicine! 




 man, I've been seeing you all over lately... Were you really a pope? 




 did you explain what you had done? Did he laugh it off? 




 you should reply:

" differently*   where* " 




 oh, you sound like such a cunt sock experiment 




 yes. 




 I said out loud to myself, "Yeah, that's right," to your comment. It doesn't make the much sense, but I'm drunk and even though I just typed then deleted a whole paragraph trying to explain it, I just want you to know that's what's up bro. 




 Diogenes would disagree. 




 pfft... Black Russian 




 Commenting to save 




 This article... Plleeaaassee. 




 An excellent question. He probably feels great about it though. 




 it's what he is! All racists with money and power are dangerous. 




 this really is excellent! 




 hell yeah bro. I play that game through every 2 years or so. 




 indeed it does. I don't think I'm ready for that much fun... 




 You can't redefine veganism to fit or support your own lifestyle choices.

Vegan/vegetarian is an ethical stance.

Yes, yes it is.

Veganism (/vignzm/) is simply an extreme form of vegetarianism which eliminates any and all animal products from the diet. It can also refer to.the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products in every manner possible

oh, and more specifically,

One of the main differences between vegan and vegetarian diets is that vegan diets exclude both eggs and dairy products...

It sounds like you might be a vegetarian. 




 Where'd you get that idea from?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism

I'd like to start making things up too.
VEGANS CAN EAT HONEY! 




 Three weeks from now: My gay retarded dog found this on his last walk. 




 hahaha, priceless! 




 I was thinking the same thing. "Oh boy, I'd end up getting drunk and hurting myself reaally bad." 




 good enough for me 




 Uh, this isn't even a funny story to me, it's become part of my life dealing with the bums down there.  




 ITT: people afraid of butterflies. *Who knew*... 




  Even though he has not proved his claim, you have also not refuted his claim.

A logical fallacy, known as an argument from ignorance.  




 which is alright, I think. 




 "YO!"
