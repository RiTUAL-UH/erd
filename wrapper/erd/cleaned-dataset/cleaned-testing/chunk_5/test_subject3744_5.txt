 When this was first posted it made me think of this exact video. The shock in the voices are just so real. The crying involved just makes you realize the shock they are going through.

 OP on youtube [just posted](http://i.imgur.com/psOncPP.png) that she is friends with the owner of the dog.

edit [found a news article](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/west-loop/dog-walker-caught-on-camera-kicking-puppy-west-loop-building)

The building's security guard, who is stationed at the entrance, noticed the beagle dog was acting odd before they entered the building's elevator, according to the property manager. At that time, the security guard watched a live video feed from the surveillance video located in the elevator on a monitor stationed near the entrance desk.

safe to say it is the right company. 




 Hard soccer pass maybe? Wouldn't surprise me if it could be enough to break a rib.

 One of my old jobs involved insurance involved repair work on cars. Was sent to a job in Compton, knocked on his door and he answered and was surprised to see me. White guy shows up to his door to replace his car stereo and the first things he does is grab a gun and put it in his waistband. He sat on the porch while i installed the fastest car stereo install ever.

 I knew the name but couldn't place it, thank you. 




 Kinda mad it isn't the whole video though, /u/GallowBoob i hated you at first but you do post some content that hasn't been seen on many subs. You do post edited content until you beat the horse dry though.

 Damnit OP i was just about to stick my pitchfork up your ass, but decided to help since you tried to redeem yourself.

 Anyone know how Morrow got the black eye? 




 who is the crowd booing? 




  they were hermetically sealed

Do you have a source for that? I searched and the best results were all on whack job conspiracy sites and it wasn't even a real source. I've worked on elevators and i hardly doubt that. 

 Black smoke , which it mostly was, is oxygen starved.

Was there black smoke in the OP video? 

I'm not going to argue, got better shit to do. 




 You sound like you don't understand how convection works. Put a shit ton of combustibles in a highrise, air flows up the elevator shafts and supplies a constant flow of oxygen to it. That is how you get such high temperatures. 




 I'll let it slide because of that boner inducing slap sound. 




 On a similar thread someone posted [this video](https://youtu.be/UvluuAIiA50) and really found it fascinating. Someone replied with a HD version but can't seem to find it.

 Overrated  




 i quit last week 




 [This map](http://i.imgur.com/8cSk8ye.jpg) shows it better than i can explain it but it isn't exactly to scale. Mainly has do with geography of the area of the LA basin. The southern most point of the california aqueduct ends at [silverwood lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Xk0Je) which feeds the high desert mainly Hesperia/Victorville. You can see the aqueduct in the top of the google map link.

The colorado aqueduct feeds into [lake Mathews](https://goo.gl/maps/qQgvj) in Riverside. You can't see the aqueduct in the supplied link because it mostly runs underground after it reaches the mountains [around here](https://goo.gl/maps/JwVJF) via the San Jacinto tunnel.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct

On the first map i link, i live in that area marked as groundwater to the east of LA. 




 i know what his problem is 




 Was just giving an example of it's location on the east side of the Rockies. Did i say anything about the water level on the google maps link? 




 Why i took the time to explain it without being a dick. I enjoy being able to ask questions in subs meant for other countries about the context. Usually everyone is really nice about it and offers a good explanation. 




  [Strontia Springs Reservoir](https://goo.gl/maps/OYk0i) 

Unfortunately it is on the wrong side of the rockies.
 




 Guy in red (runner) needs be touched by the ball before he touches the 3rd base.  Since Trout was able to touch the base and keep his foot on it before the ball touches him he is considered safe. If there was another runner on second base, the third baseman only needs to touch the base before the runner does.  




 Watched it live and couldn't believe it until like the 3rd replay. 




 Colorado river only feeds SoCal and not much of the LA area, Mainly Riverside and San Diego and parts of San Bernardino. All of the central valley gets its water from the north part of the state. 




 Only time will tell when the wall goes up to divide the rich from the poor. 




 Yes by "old stone" i meant that in the same context that i stated. OP has mentioned countless times on how he wants his landscaping and showed how he wants to enjoy his "Backyard." 

I am happy you used the term "usanians," it should be used more often in this same context. We are all the product of the same experiment. 

edit - wow i sound like a drunk asshole... someone be my friend 




 Do you have any luck with that username? 




 I'm sure it it easier to get rid of old stone in the US compared to some of the older cities with history of those kind of stones in Europe. 




 The stone was ugly as shit, love how your project turned out. 




 OP this is wonderful, once this post gets enough views the nice people  will come in and clean it up. 




 Guess my lazy ass will reach for the keyboard to thank you. I copy and paste letters sometimes because i'm to lazy to type it. 




 Why does it seem like nbc have such a boner for hawks?

 We have a global outreach instantly compared to news more than 50 years ago. 




 It is hard to like baseball, it takes a certain kind of fan to love baseball. 




 This is the reason i go to Angels games and not Dodger games, anytime i have to drive into downtown LA for NBA or MLB games it takes more than hour. I can be in my seat to an Angels/Ducks game within 30min of leaving my house. Both markets are the same distance from where i live.

 We lost one almost the same way with the fluid around the lungs, we had her drained and brought her home. The next day she was still doing ok, but the more active she became more it made the fluid worse. Third day she was having such a hard time breathing that i immediately took her to the vet and had her put down. 




 Who are the kids?

 In the other pic OP posted you can see the spindle is extended out without spacers, so it probably doesn't even come close to the bumper.

 Ya not your typical dive bar. 




 Most of the popular beers will have more than one keg attached as well. 




 No shit? If you are aggressive on the way you pursue them it is just going to make them drive even more insane. Exactly what this video shows. He could have tried to keep his distance which at the 4 minute mark he was told to do so but ignored it. Even saying traffic wasn't as bad as it actually is, if you can't safely narrow down a search area after you break off a pursuit, then you don't have enough officers that clearly are needed.

It isn't like the bank robber went in and shot the place up like north hollywood. Once he robs a bank the FBI are involved, no reason to jeopardise my family or your family to capture a guy that can get away with a few thousands dollars only to be captured in a better and easier way later. Why escalate a deadly situation even more by provoking a suspect? Up until the end a single officer was in pursuit of a vehicle and it caused more danger to the public than putting a dangerous bank robber into custody.

edit - I love how you immediately downvote because you disagree

 




 /r/thebox  




 I'm guessing the new one you are talking about is the one in the second link. 




 it's life. 




 Canadian engineer here. Believe it or not, their job page was officially named RIMjobs at one time. /facepalm 




 Am i the only one that thinks the aggressive speeds reached in traffic are more reckless than a bank robber getting away with insured money? If you have to put this many innocent people in danger to get one guy of the street, when should you say protecting the innocent is more important?


Edit - Even at the 4 minute mark the other officer says to disengage the pursuit and the main officer says copy, but continues to pursue when it gets the most dangerous.  




 Prob would if they were in the lower section. 




 I used to install alarms for 10 years, using [this](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=43) you could do what you want. The original key goes inside the box and gets hidden in the dash, then has a transmitting wire that feeds the unique keyfob up to the cylinder. You can use any kind of metal key after you set this up.

Just realized the first link is discontinued, this is the [newer version](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=44) of the same product but i have never installed one.

 still some rain in the foothills of socal currently. 




 I would agree, but it keeps trade on the world's oceans efficient.  




 Fuck them, just made it my desktop background because i love geology and it highlights the different layers. 




 Wish i could take a subway, where i live in socal it would take more than a hour to reach any stadium around here by rail.

 Went there in elementary school on a field trip, but we just went around and looked at the plants. There was no education that a elementary school kid will remember. 




 Seems to be heading that way, I wouldn't exactly say MTV picked on the kid like /u/Paradiselost541 says. It gives you an insight into his head and try to understand what he thinks. Gives people more context into what someone with a learning disability deals with and can comprehend the world they live in.

 Ex gf had a 17 year old cat that lost her vision suddenly, retinas just suddenly started giving and detached. We got rid of the bedframe to the bed and just put the box spring and mattress on the floor. The cat would sometimes forget about the drop off and walk of the end of the bed until she got used to it. She still knew where the food and litter box was and figured out how to reach the living room. Sometimes running into things getting used to it and where everything was. 




 Congrats on making me hate you. 




 The basics are understood on how it works, but can you explain why a volcano erupts on this side and then a major earthquake happens on the otherside?

 




 It really is, Can we in history and as humans imagine 300 million years? Even a billion? We still don't really understand a million years ago. We really only learned about plate tectonics in the last 50 years and we still can't explain it. 




 you're not OP... 




 Most of the good ones can't be dropped in water though.

 Yes, i believe in June our city is going to offer $2 sqft to remove lawn and to put in something better. Might do it to the side of the house that has sun all day. 




 I think inches would be dramatic... and thanks for linking the thread. 




 How much elevation change do you think could be happening?  




 Fuck the haters on your shoes and other bullshit. You are who you are and she fell in love with you. Just be glad you found someone who loves you that could care how you dress and is your best friend. Everyone else here on reddit atm are just jealous because you found love and they have not.  




 The two recommended to me were [Buffalo Grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouteloua_dactyloides) or [Zoysia grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoysia).

Currently most of my lawn is at least 4 different types, Mostly invaded by crabgrass, which  results in [this](http://i.imgur.com/C98MKpw.jpg). After renting an industrial power rake.

My whole lawn has a mixture of permanent shade and sun.

Please help...

edit - i know St Augustine is used around here a lot, will have to use the identification tool to find how what types i have currently, the shaded areas are different type than the ones in the sun. I also need to get rid of the shade that is currently there, the two trees that provide the shade are very old and termite infested. They are on the curbside, and would have to get the city to remove them.

 Someone needs a snickers. 




 You can always use a sharp knife to cut underneath it. 




 Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.

Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it. 




 Or finding something not in the same field of your degree and gaining work experience and creating a job history. Doing these will probably further your career than a degree and sitting on the side of the road making people sorry enough for you to give you a job.

 What part of the IE though and how far into LA do you have to drive for work? I live in the west side of the IE and still would spend an easily 2 hours getting home from west LA.  




 I filled a 5 gallon water bottle less than a quarter of the way and it was almost $300 bucks. 




 What kind of drill bit is this? I've never seen one with a different kind of metal in the tip of the core. Guessing it is for easy replacing the sharp starting edge of the bit?
