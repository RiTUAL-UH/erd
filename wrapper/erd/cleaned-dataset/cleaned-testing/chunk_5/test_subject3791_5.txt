 Hello. I have a recipe running which triggers every time i make a new post on my Tumblr blog. It then sends an e-mail to my Buffer account using Gmail.

Recipe works great, but it won't add the main image of my posts as an image on the e-mail it sends and instead it sends an "image not found" picture. I have to say that i'm not creating image posts, just normal text posts with an image on top.

[This is the recipe i am using](http://i.imgur.com/atcfFsF.jpg).

Any ideas? 




 Mmm, can't really stop the fan without removing the PSU from the case since it's mounted upside down and on the bottom of the case are some covers for the air (can't remove them).

But i'll try that.

EDIT: I can see the PSU fan turning from the back of the tower (on the bottom) and i think that the noise i'm hearing is synced with the fan. 




 Tapping the PSU doesn't stop the noise, it just makes it "faster" for some seconds, like it's doing some more "spins", like it's losing it's rhythm. I can't describe it correctly.

Truth is i've been also having coil whine/noises from one of my hard disks and from the GPU. I fixed the noise from the GPU by setting the fans a bit higher and the hard disk by unscrewing it a bit. 




 I see, thank you very much. Maybe i'll try my luck with an RMA, but support here in Greece is not that good (it can get extremely complicated to RMA a faulty device) and that's why i'm asking if that noise is bad news for my computer. 




 Doesn't coil whine actually sounds like whining? Like [this](http://youtu.be/HP73edpQwgc?t=2m13s)? Mine is a more buzzing one. 




 Hello. I have an Evga Supernova NEX650G Gold Power Supply 650W. During the past weeks, the PSU started making a buzzing electric sound. It's not very loud, but you are able to hear it, especially if you are near the PC/PSU.
 
I checked for loose connections, tried the computer on another socket, with and without a UPS, nothing helped. According to the BIOS, the PSU is giving the correct voltages and there has been no malfunctions. But is this sound normal?

[This is a video](https://vid.me/Sqke) i recorded on which you can hear the buzz )starting at 00:09). You can hear a similar noise [on this video](https://vid.me/qB2) (it's from another user having a similar problem with a similar PSU). 



















 151, thanks! 



















 My bad, i added a link to my Twitter account on the original post in order to prove that i also like LibreOffice (and that i'm not affiliated with MS in any way). I just fixed that and messaged the mods, i hope it will be restored. 




 Haha, yes, that's true :).

(and that's one thing i didn't like on Office 2013). 




 Since it's Microsoft's, i guess there's a n extremely small possibility to be ever available for Linux...

You may try the [web version](https://www.onenote.com/Notebooks) or the [Official Web Apps](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/07/run-microsoft-office-web-apps-ubuntu-desktop). 




 Office? Office is not an app, it's a suite of apps. Which app do you mean? 




 File-Account-Sign out and try to sign back again. 









 How many times has this been reposted? Over 25000? Over 45000? 




 From what I remember, it has a 60mb upload limit every month. But yes, I agree with you, people should use what's best for them  




 When I was using Evernote, the free version had very limited space and bandwidth. Onenote connects with your Onedrive and so you have much larger space available. 




 [Here](http://www.321download.com/LastFreeware/alphabetically.html) is the directory of available apps.

My favourite one is [Fastone Capture](http://www.321download.com/LastFreeware/page4.html#FastStone Capture), which is now a paid app.

**EDIT**: I have no affiliation with the site or the above app. 




 No. I repeat: in my opinion, YSK that Microsoft OneNote for Windows, which was a paid app and part of a costly Office suite, is now available for free, with many updates. 




 Because it's free and it's a very good app. Many people don't know that Microsoft offers such a great tool for free, since it was part of the paid Office suite just a few months ago. 




 Maybe [this](http://lifehacker.com/migrate-your-data-from-evernote-to-onenote-with-this-to-1560885406)? 














 I'm in need for a song of that kind today... :)

Edit: Added comment 









 Its not when its angled. I know what you mean, had that with a galaxy nexus. Its almost everywhere, no need for angle.

I'll repeat, Microsoft has already acknowledged the defect. 







































 According to them, it's limited.

But there are many reports online from users about this issue. Some say that they needed to exchange their Lumia 930 3-4 times until they got a good one. That's why i'm waiting before demanding an exchange, chances are that even the second one might have similar issues. 




 Microsoft confirmed the issue.

 The authorized service found nothing wrong with my phone. From what i read, there are many Lumia 920/930 with screen issues. It's up to the service if it's going to offer a replacement.

EDIT: For example, look at the replies [on this topic](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes). 




 So, after Microsoft [promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2qptfp/lumia_930_microsoft_is_working_on_a_new_update/) a software update for those buggy Lumia 930 screens, we are still waiting. This happened a month ago, and still nothing.  All they can do right now [is "feel" and "hope"](https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/560042370251505667) and tell you to [wait](https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/553279308559417345).

This is not a rage against Microsoft, since i really wanted (and still want) to like Lumia 930 very much, i really like Windows Phone and i don't/didn't want to buy an Android or iOS phone. It's just my disappointment for all those defects (screen is one of my problems, the most serious one).

I'm going to wait a few weeks more, for a fix/optimization with an update or with Windows 10. If nothing happens, i'll just request/demand a screen/phone replacement and never buy a Windows Phone again.

As i [wrote](https://twitter.com/test_subject3791gr/status/560044091522568192) on Twitter

 @LumiaHelp Sorry, you are a company, we paid much money for those phones. You don't just "feel" and "hope", you do and solve asap

Otherwise, make no promises.
