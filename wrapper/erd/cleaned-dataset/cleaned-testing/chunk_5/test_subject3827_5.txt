 Probably March, too - there's really not much coming out in those months that's big enough to beat Star Wars 




 He said no because he was concerned over how big of a deal it was, and that he was unsure if he wanted to risk making a bad movie and disappointing everyone.

Abrams is a lifelong Star Wars fan, I doubt he would turn that down because it took up too much time. 




 That Luke one was released yesterday, and it is a very obvious fake from that picture of Mark Hamill with his beard. Reverse the "leaked image," and put it next to the Hamill one. 




 Nope, that's gonna be Rogue One - why else would they choose to not have Marvel at a *comic* convention and put Star Wars instead? Something big is coming. 




 Yeah :( 




 Seriously?? Where? 




 Cleaned it up a little... Not my best work, but good enough

 Most likely from trailer 3 




 In reality, all this does is create more hype for the movie. Two screenshots that give away very little information won't make that much of a difference to them. 




 It does to the countless number of people who do care about star wars 




 No, I followed, but I have my facts, and you have your wrong opinions. That's okay. 




 Mad Max, Interstellar... 




 Too bad Star Wars is gonna be there :) 




 You know what, I don't even know why I bother.

 You have absolutely no idea what has happened in the 30 year gap between the films.

Also, what's with you using the term "mulatto?" I forget, are we living in racially segregated Alabama in the 1960s or is this 2015? 




 THERE ARE OTHER JEDIS IN THE UNIVERSE.  




 Well, you proved me wrong. I really appreciate you taking the time to find that direct quote and showing me how you were right this whole time.

:/ 




 Why not? Give me facts. Give me a quote from someone that definitively says that, "Finn is not a Jedi." Has the movie come out yet? No. Have you seen the movie? No. You have literally no way of knowing any of this. 




 Looks pretty shopped to me 




 To keep it interesting, to change things up, to make the story better, to give new and talented actors a chance to try things, to challenge the assumptions that people have about who is who, etc. Pretty simple.

You see that? That was art of Finn's costume officially shown at the official Star Wars celebration. What's that in his pocket? A lightsaber. They were *very* deliberate in what they chose to show, so there's absolutely no way that that's not a hint of some kind. 




 Exactly how I like to look at it - or decades! Only 1/20th of a decade until it comes out! 




 TL;DR - Literally nothing. 




 Well, it is actually. It's like calling Pulp Fiction a cult classic, when it's really well known, critically acclaimed, and pretty successful. 




 I think you might be one of the only people with that opinion, no offense. 




 It made enough money to qualify as successful and it got good reviews. Not exactly overshadowed. 




  fucking condescension 

A lot more condescending than what OP said. Besides, why would you need someone to prove you wrong on an opinion? Isn't that what opinions are for? 




 It has nothing to do with how good/bad of an adaptation it is, it's just a poorly written, somewhat badly acted movie. It's just not good filmmaking. 




 It's incredibly well directed. Stanley Kubrick is pretty much known for being able to direct things well. 




 We're only 6 months away from the release of Star Wars The Force Awakens! 




 Foxcatcher? 




 I don't have a picture of the page, but this is the figure:

 It has a waaayy better lineup of first party games, and it had a lot more innovative features, no matter what you say about their quality.

Not on the page it was originally posted to 




 The comment said "I can't wait for 9/11" (when Mario maker comes out), but that could be confused to mean something else  




 Just because the consoles don't sell well, doesn't mean they're bad. The Wii U is a fantastic piece of hardware, and I would take it any day over an XBone or PS4 




 I guess this is confirmation that it's real  




 What's wrong with Spielbergian? If anything I'd take that as a complement... 




 Me too :( 




 Nope, not really. Alec Guiness does not lose any of our respect after his death. 




 You still refer to King George III as King George III, even though he's dead. 




 Tarantino has nowhere near as wide of an appeal 




 Not on the same scale as Star Wars or Jurassic World or The Avengers 




 Well, I thought so. But, y'know, sarcasm is a little hard to communicate over the interwebs. A /s might help. 




 I hope that's sarcasm 




 I doubt Daisy Ridley will, but maybe John Boyega 




 He backed himself into a corner there didn't he 




 Or you could just eat one piece at a time with your hands 




 That's a little excessive. What if someone told you they didn't like the way you talked, so they just cover their ears when you open your mouth? It's stupid, and doesn't really make much sense. 




 No, I wouldn't mind having more Star Wars trilogies - it's just that you spew a constant stream of BS. 




 Can you stop? 




 Yeah, I've seen most of those - now that I think about it, Dr. Strangelove would probably work pretty well. Thanks! 




 Yeah, that's one of the ones I was thinking of. 




 Ok 




 Today was really disappointing. 




 Watch some of their other stuff. Trust me, this was their worst review in a while. 














 July 10th, when we'll most likely get it, is less than a month away - that's not far off! 




 Wait what? 




 No one is interested in low budget foreign risky science fiction action drama mystery prison break fantasy wizard films anymore

 You know you can just buy the toys if you just ask 




 Not KotOR 3 




 Possibly - it could refer to a person, as in *the* rogue one 




 STOP IT WITH THE FROSTBITE! WE GET IT! IT LOOKS GOOD! 




 But no one said the movie centered around X Wing pilots 




 What does it feel like being one of the best gamers in the world? 




 It's a rare phenomenon, that has occurred a few times in the past few months, most notably at the release of Star Wars 7 Teaser 2, Fallout 4 announcement, and Fallout 4 release date confirmation. It is expected to happen again at the gathering known as "San Diego Comic Con," where new and exciting information about games and movies alike will be unveiled. 




 Hateful 8's December/January dude 




 You're entitled to your opinion, but that doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong. If the general public likes something that you  don't, it's probably something that makes a lot of people happy and something that they can enjoy.  




 Mother 3 is coming to America! ... Eventually... Hopefully... 




 Yeah - I really hope I can see it that way someday 




 One of the only movies I can think of that's almost perfect 




 Mkay 




 Haha she can't sit through a 2 hour movie but she makes an exception for a 4 hour one :P 




 /uj Well, it's probably going to turn out to be true /uj 




 Huh, that's weird.

I think that might be an extra blaster on the side. 




 I need no sympathy 




 Could be... Looks pretty legit

 Well, I think it has a lot of redeeming qualities. It's certainly a competently made movie, and Steven Spielberg almost never fails to make an enjoyable/watchable film. I like how it mirrors a 50s sci-fi b-movie, which is a different take on what the Indiana Jones series usually is. 




 No, didn't say you ruined my day. I was just saying you were making unnecessarily rude comments to those who thought there was no reason to make a post like the one you did... 




 Well, he's a competent filmmaker, and he wanted to do it. Being friends with Spielberg was only an added benefit, I'm sure. 




 Here you go. These are just the first few that I thought of. Don't go with the assumption that every pre-1960 movie is a wacky Three Stooges-esque screwball comedy
 
Citizen Kane
Casablanca 
Paths of Glory
Ben-Hur
The Bridge on the River Kwai
The Wizard of Oz
Singin' in the Rain
12 Angry Men
Gone with the Wind
It's a Wonderful Life
Rear Window
North by Northwest
Vertigo
Metropolis
Seven Samurai
Anatomy of a Murder
Some Like it Hot
On the Waterfront
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves


 




 Oh I'm sorry we're all being such babies complaining about how you posted useless speculation regarding a movie you've seen *3 times* in 4 weeks. 




 Yeah, but you ask the question like most movies from pre-1960 are like that, which is not true.
 




 The Man Who Knew Too Much 




 No... That's not true! THATS IMPOSSIBLE! 




 Thats *your,* idiot 




 That's a bit of a stretch. 

Almost like saying, "Harrison Ford in plane crash = foreshadowing Han's death," or "Peter Mayhew old = Chewbacca dies" 




 No, Riggan also directed and wrote the adaptation of the play 




 "What pre-1960 film is still watchable?" What kind of question is that? Which ones *wouldn't* be watchable? 




 God I know - I don't know if my body will be able to handle it  




 Good point 




 Seems a little more believable than most of the stuff on here 




 So, all the millions of people that like Star Wars are neckbeards? And you expect not to get negative comments from people who disagree with your unpopular opinion? 




 Yeah - Rogue One is December 16th, 2016 and I think Episode 8 is May 26th 2017 - Anthology 2 is confirmed for 2018, and Episode 9 for 2019 




 By David Lean? On every level, David Lean's movies are almost perfect. Have you ever seen The Bridge on the River Kwai, or Lawrence of Arabia, or Doctor Zhivago? Replace that with Middle Earth. 




 Imagine how great a David Lean Star Wars or LotR movie would've been... 




 No - Netflix usually puts complete seasons of shows months after they air  




 What? Nimoy, Lee, and Brooks? I certainly hope not. I don't know if I'd be able to live with myself anymore :( 




 Shows from most major networks the next day? That's pretty good if you ask me. 




 I'm sure that's what's coming. 




 It could be a really cool comic  




 And Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation will have come out by August, so I would think Star Wars at D23 will be Rogue One 




 Episode 7 was printed on all the signs outside the studio in England and on the crew member clothing  




 Well, it's not up to the general audience and JJ Abrams to decide what's canon - the books are, and there's nothing you can do about it. It doesn't matter who cares about it, it's up to the people at the Lucasfilm Story Group. 




 I guess they don't want to spoil anything - it could mean bad reviews, but you never know.

The fan reaction has been pretty much positive though. It supposed to be the best of the sequels by far, and I can't imagine that there's anything explicitly wrong with it to make it *bad*. 




 Oh gawd it seems so far... 




 No I totally understand
