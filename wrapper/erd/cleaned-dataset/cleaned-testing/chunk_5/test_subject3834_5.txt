 So sarcastic and passive aggressive. You must have a really well-groomed vagina. You sorry saps are doing this to yourself, bitching like a bunch of children. I'm just calling it like I see it, but hey, if you want to join in the circle-jerk of useless whining, be my guest. Not mine or any other man'd fault that you feel inferior. Here's a tip though - doing this dear diary high-school shit on reddit isn't going to help you feel better about yourself or life here on planet-motherfucker. Good luck. I hope you can work through your neuroses and emotional problems. Be a real women or man, and face up to that shit. No one wants to deal with an adult child.  




 Clearly you didn't read what I wrote. It's ok though. I'm sure commiserating with your fellow hens in the sewing circle has elevated you oh so much in their eyes, and has contributed much to your well-being, never mind how pathetic this drivel sounds, and how it benefits neither sexes, nor does anything to demonstrate emotional maturity in a man. Most of you sound like chicks bitching about your so-called friends because you are too afraid to confront them, and you aren't man enough to deal with your own feelings, whatever that may entail. Frankly, it's pathetic and disgusting. Thank gosh for te anonymity of the Internet.  




 This post is retarded.  It's cancer.  What are we, a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order?  Do you guys not have balls?  Do you feel the need to hate on your fellow man to elevate yourself, as if you're some chick in the sewing circle?


I hate people who answer and thus give credence to this sort of trash, and what I hate are the obnoxious and stupid characteristics that are common in most people, sexes be damned. 




 Yep, but I hear you on the spelling/attention thing.  But even in professional fields, the standards of grammar and even things like basic sentence structure and all manners of other elements have gone to complete shit, or at least it seems that way sometimes.  Attention to details are important, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people don't pay attention, be it on their resumes, their e-mails, their text messages, or to their own goddamn life and what they are feeling and how they deal with it, period  :D


Keep up the good fight though.  I myself would allow for no more than one, two typos max on a resume ;) 




 Honestly, nothing. Men are pretty damn great. Namely, what I hate are characteristics that are common in most people, namely stupidity, willful ignorance, solopsism, and unnecessarilly catty bull-shit like this stupid post.


What I'm saying is, I hate the kind of douche-bag that would answer this, like he's some lost fucking hen who is quite low in the pecking order. The emotionally retarded and immature type of people who aren't man enough to deal with their own feelings, whatever that entails.


Honestly - what are we here?  A bunch of fucking women?


Edit:  seriously. Fuck this post.  It's cancer.  




 But there are so many, with so many nuances, that's why people specialize in just one field of it, and are hired to exploit the system and find loop-holes in said system... 




 But can't we all just get along?  Treat everyone the way you want to be treated!  Ad nauseum! 




 Either way, this is totally exciting me! 




 Awww, you didn't hire him?  But what forethought and clarity of purpose!  He would have surely been a great asset to your team! 




 Fuck yeah!  Kim is one of my fav porn stars! 




 You nailed a good few of them.  I'd add Whitney Cummings, and about most of the other American female comedians out there, among a bunch of the guys as well :D 




 You have good taste my friend.  May you be blessed by Patton Oswalt and his over-rated fat-ass being hit by Whitney Cummings plane as it crashes down from the sky. 




 I love that guy, but there was a point in one of his own specials where he even seemed to be sick or tired of working that schtick.  His broader, farther-reaching bits about humanity, social interaction, human connectivity, and the paints of being a parent are all solid and hillarious though.  Worth noting, saw him live, and with not much material on the former, he was fucking hillarious.  Probably the hardest I've ever laughed in my life :D 




 Not just that, but she's super fucking lame and her material is absolute shit...   




 He is/was a comedian? :P 




 Don't forget a lot of American female comedians as well...  they're just...not funny. 




 Eh, if popculture and Itunes have taught us anything, it's never underestimate the public's ability to gulp down copious amounts of shit-stained swill.  I wouldn't bet on it. 




 Your tub!?  That's her tub too buddy! 




 But he was doing you a favor? 




 What a great way to attract talent!  Don't mind the colorful language and boob-grabbing! 




 So many crushed dreams, so many idiots... 




 Was he qualified?  I mean, while I can appreciate cheekiness on either side of the table, it seems a lot of arbitrary standards, bias, opinions, and negative experiences and conditioning get in the way of the interview process, which sort of makes you sound like an ass-hole :D 




 Book smart?  That's just a term stupid people use to justify their lack of smarts :D 




 But look at her willingness to do dirty jobs and take on huge problems that are seemingly impossible to her!  Clearly she would have been an all-star employee!  Tell me you hired her! 




 But, if you had a sense of humor, would you have hired him?  :P 




 Cuz hell yeah for teen pregnancy and shitty, immature parents :D 




 They had their eyes on the prize!  Clearly they were a focused individual!  How could you not hire them!? 




 Dude!  How could you not have hired him?  Clearly he shows creativity and innovation when it comes to solving problems!  As for the rest?  Well, he doesn't give a fuck! 




 It sure seems there are a lot of stupid, ignorant, strange, and lazy people on the interviewee side of the table, but I'd like to hear about the idiots on the other side.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Well, I can't speak on that, but if you're posting related materials/comments in perfectly suitable posts and sub-forums, then the moderators have no business perma-banning someone.  Judging by the way they are quick to ban people for seemingly no good reason without giving said people a chance to explain anything (as if it should be needed in some of these cases), I'd say they have itchy trigger-fingers. 




 Whoa...just, whoa... on all of that D: 




 Such dedication though! 




 Project 1999 as a game is pretty great, but Honestly, whoever regulates those forums seem to be completely humorless and unaware of appropriate context and forum topics. I was banned within a few hours of posting a few comments that were completely in-line and relevant to the topics I was replying too. It seems they are power-hungry control freaks who have a hard time understanding people, language, context, etc. don't take it personally, but that forum is kinda fucking stupid :) 




 What if he really is the best - and you missed out on an opportunity to hire an amazing worker?


That being said, yes, he sounds like a dick, but I love how little nuances and things that those who are hiring choose to take offense at are so subjective and dependent on their own experiences and bias.  I wonder how many people who would be perfect fits at certain jobs and companies wind up being passed over because the hiring manager/HR/boss/whatever chose something asinine to be annoyed at, or projected their own personal issues onto the hiree  :D 




 Wow...  just wow.  Couldn't you have told them both to get off the planet period, and fired them from their sorry attempts at being human beings?  You would have done us all a great favor  :D 




 Hey, you'd be upset too if you had semen in your eye! 




 Bwahahahaha.  Simpsons did it first anyhow.  Your day:  0  Me:  1 




 That's what he gets for trying to steal your TV!

 I'd opt for less vitality and go for 15 arcane, as the hunter's tools are awesome for PvP and PvE (specially beast roar), as well as a bit more skill.  




 Perfect for costume parties, or murdering people in the early AM hours of the morning!  Absolutely frightening! 




 Yeah, I just noticed that yesterday as a matter of fact - yes they are.  From the side-views of those attack animations you can see them fairly clearly and easily.  Between that, and the wintern lanters' brains being composed of seemingly dead messengers, it seems that a lot of the nightmare creatures are somehow made out of twisted/perverted messengers, which leads me to believe the messengers are messengers of the MP or some other great one, and since the great ones seem to have different methods and goals, that the Mensis school likely experimented or flat out somehow enslaved and warped some of the messengers, somehow.

 Wow.  What a bunch of presumptuous assholes of so-called friends.  You don't need stupid people like that in your life.  That being said, stop trying to buy/impress friends in that manner. 




 Wait, what?  What bridge wolves?

 It looks like full metal alchemist meets dead space meets bloodborne? :D 




 Actually, no.  I was much more specific than you, namely in regards to maximizing the potential of the physical/arcane split weapons.  But, you're welcome.  BLEAAAAAAAAAARGHEEVOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITREGURGITATIONEBLEAAAAAAARGH! 




 24 Episodes is fine with me for any series, really.  I mean, especially the way anime tends to draw itself out and all :D

Will definitely check this out. 




 Uuuuh, what show is that?  I need to watch it! 




 Those split arcane weapons are not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, they are meant to be maxed via the +% physical and flat arcane damage gems, as their base arcane damage is super low.


That being said, it isn't awkward, you just have to have the uncanny burial blade (cuz the regular one with waning gem slot sucks), and you can take that AR upwards of 600 relatively easy, and that is with regular depth 5 chalice drops, not the more rarer, top-of-the-line rank 20 gems or abysmal gems from bosses.  The BoM are even more OP with those odd gems, because it hits like a truck, and it hits super fast.


That being said, the problem is, it is way more work and effort to do all that, rather than say, get a ludwigs which is basically OP out the gate, even with mediocre % physical gems on it.  Plus, it can be enchanted.  This is why everyone likes and uses ludwigs - because it is easy to obtain, and easy to increase the damage with little to no chalice farming or work.  It's a total bummer that certain builds and weapons in this game are so lop-sided when it comes to optimizing them and staying competitive :( 




 Riflespear is fun as shit to play with, but it is very mediocre in damage, hell, even reach, unless you are talking about the riflespear bug, which is bad to base a more permanent build around, since it will likely be fixed via patch soon enough.  I used the riflespear exclusively on my BT and SKL build characters until I obtained better weapons in late game (cuz I hate the cane), and again, while distinct and fun, the riflespear is easily outclassed in both range and damage by the axe, or ludwigs, and most anything else.  That, and if you are talking about the riflespear bug, it will likely take him awhile to get to a place to farm the correct gems to make it bugged/OP. 




 Right. And the arcane scaling on the split weapons is shit and not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, and you gimp the split weapons if you only put %physical gems on them as well.  those weapons are meant to be boosted using the gems I mentioned, as the arcane stat itself makes almost no difference on them. 

The split weapons aren't suppose to be turned into pure arcane either, because they have low base arcane damage and scaling in the first place, and wind up just as gimpy if you try to use them that way. 

Edit:  the tonitrus is optimized via elemental damage gems, which are a lot harder to farm. Or at least, more obnoxious. 


Edit 2:  to be clear, I'm trying to tell you why those split weapons are the way they are, and how an and how to properly utilize their stats.  




 Actually, the corect gems for BoM and Burial blade are the +phys % and +flat arcane.  You can make your Burial blade 600+ AR easily this way, and same thing with BoM.  That is how those should be gemmed correctly. 




 I got the perfect build for you.  It's bad-ass, sturdy, gives you access to all those tools you mentioned, and you can make several weapons ridiculously OP (though for burial blade, you need to get the uncanny version to be able to put in all +phys % gems and flat arcane damage, as the waning gem slots suck ass).  That being said, Rosmarinus wouldn't be the focus here, as you will top off at 15 arcane, though you could move the stats around, but 25 end is good to be able to use the different weapon combos out there.  Anyway, here is the awesome OP build that makes you shine for quality weapons and SKL weapons, but you could also viably use some STR weapons just for the hell of it if you didnt want to be too op:

40 Vit

25 End

25 STR

50 SKL

5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P

15 ARC


There is your 110 build if you start with Cruel Fate (has only 5 blood tinge).  You can adjust the Vit/end/SKL to your liking, but with this build and the correct weapons and gems, you can have a 650-700 AR Burial Blade, a 600 AR BoM, and a 850-950 AR Ludwig's (stupid, right?) with the phantasm shell.  Have fun!


Edit:  Thanks to my mate here on reddit who showed me how ridiculously awesome this quality build is :D

 




 He is the only truly altruistic character in the story, and he says as much, dialogue along the lines of "I only wanted to help," and something about his family telling him he was wrong.  He is just a genuinely friendly, creepy, dude. 




 Which is a shame, cuz it's a fun weapon to use.  I used it exclusively until I got the burial blade and BoM on my skill build, cuz I hate the cane  




 How many hundreds of hours did you play DaS2?  :P


Funny, for being such a terrible game, all the FROM fans still played it more than any other game out there.  The best way to put it is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, but it is not a fantastic FROM game :D 




 It looked pretty damn good on my PC.  That being said, what all the DaS2 whiners meant (even after they played the game for hundreds and thousands of hours, and ejoyed it) is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, and it was still game of the year in 2014, but it is the least souls-like of the souls games.  It is a great RPG game, just not a great FROM game :D 




 Fuck all the whiners.  They still played it more than any other game out there, they still put 100's to 1000's of hours on it, and it was still the best game of 2014, hands down.  No other game, even AAA, had the same replayability and diversity DaS2 had, especially for PvP.  I love how people will say, "it's a terrible game, I only played it for 1000 hours"...  like, really?  What the fuck dude?  


But I get what they mean.  What all the DaS2 whiners are trying to say (and the best way to put it is), DaS2 is the best RPG game of all the Souls games, but it is the least Souls-like of all the souls games, or at least, the most deficient of the souls games when it comes to all the little quirks and nuances that made the souls games great.


That being said, DaS2 easily has the best PvP and matchmaking of all the games (aside soul memory), and definitely has the best variety in terms of weapons/armor (even if it is redundant), but even that is great, as the fashion options are spectacular! 




 Hahaha.  Yep.  when I think Oedipus complex, I think of children wanting to bang their mothers... 




 LOL 




 I hope they do fix it, as I love this wepaon and find it very fun to play with it, even though without the bug, it is kinda weak compared to other weapons, it can still be pimped out quite nicely :D


That being said, like any other obviously OP or broken shit, I don't see it as a matter of will they fix it, but when will they fix it?  :D 




 Haha.  He sucked and died, in that order :D 




 The DLC in DaS was cut content that they just didn't have time to put in the original game, and that content was fantastic and worth it's entertainment dollar a hundred times over.  The DLC in DaS2 went hand-in-hand with the story, but I still think it was more of an after-thought (or at least, not like it was going to be implemented in original game), BUT, the DLC for DaS2 was the highlight of the game, with some of the best game-design and challenging bosses and some great new items and weapons.


The point is, I will buy DLC for Bloodborne in a heart-beat, whether it was intended content that was cut due to time-constraints, or an after-thought :D 




 Yeah - I hear ya on the checklist thing.  After a while it becomes mechanical, especially when you've done them on more than one character.  I actually enjoy creating my own due to the mystery of them, or trying out other people's glyphs, but the story-line chalices became redundant the second time around.  At the least, I would have enjoyed some different tile sets and lay-outs, or even more interesting would have been a wave-like enemy arena or boss challenge.  I think that would have fit just fine into the game, and really showcase the enemies as well as the player characters :D 




 So OP! 




 There is an enemy in the guide called "Izzy's admirer," though I can't remember who it was for.  I think it was an NPC hunter... 




 On my first NG ever I was able to stunlock him to death with a hunter's axe and 20 stamina.  I dont think he even had a chance to attack.  Same thing went on my BoM run.  Guy is ridiculously easy and under-powered, especially for being such a burly looking monster.  I wish he was as challenging as he looks :/ 




 Really?  I didn't know you could die to this guy?  Not trying to be a smart-ass, but I thought this was a terrible boss fight due to how easy he is.  Seriously, if you just look at him he becomes stunlocked :D
 




 I still felt bad killing her.  Even as a beast, she is kinda pretty and majestic.  Also, feel free to use "Ron the Funky Caterpillar" too :D 




 There should be a "you're gonna die," emote, or at the least, something like "careful, this aint NG" :D 




 Yep.  To me she is the Reindeer Beast of Christmas Past :D 




 Bingo. My guess is they'd need a larger amount of time to change it more than they did in making the gameplay swifter, yet still weighty. I love the game as well, and the only bad part is that the superb level design hides how short the game really is. Chalice dungeons are pretty cool, and a great feature overall, but I just wish they had time for more tile sets :D 




 Yes, for other content, not game-changing mechanics.  Don't start the blind hype-train all over again... 




 I agree for the most part, and fuck all that blind-hype-train crap people got all worked up over anyhow.  Disapointment is what happens when you have blind, unfounded expectations.  A lot of it seemed too complicated and convoluted and exclusive anyhow.


That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :( 




 What's that you say?  You miss losing more and more of your HP meter like in Dark Souls 2?  :D 




 Yep.  And that dissapointment is what people get for hopping on the blind-ass hype-train.  Don't know why people chose to believe in that shit and actually put their expectations on it in the first place :/ 




 Well, as far as I can tell, that was all speculation, and people blindly got on the hype-train, and surprise surprise when FROM didn't have some sort of in-depth transformation mechanic and covenant system, especially to the degrees that players expected it.  


And it's funny that people somehow expected these crazy covenants and transformations and blood mechanics, yet what we wound up is the most hands-off, lamest, shallow and bland covenant systemto date :/


All that being said, it's still the best game of 2015 so far, and likely will stay that way, and hey, at least Play Station 4 has one good game on it :) 




 Eh, that's what happens when people got on the speculation hype-train with no proof.  Even if those were the original ideas (which I don't think they were) it would have probably been far too ambitious, and be super hard to balance, and who needs balance when you have ludwig's holy blade anyhow? :D 




 My thoughts:  if that was indeed the case and the idea (as I thought all that was just speculation, and not actually from FROMsoft), it was probably too ambitious, and they had to simplify it quite a bit :/ 




 You're welcome.  Have fun :D 




 You can't just create any random dungeon glyph (even with all necessary materials) unless you've already created a dungeon of that specification.  So if you wanted to make a 'cursed ihyll' of a specific glyph, you first have to make a 'cursed ihyll' of your own.  


Provided you have all the materials you need, you go to a blank gravestone, use 'condust chalice ritual,' option, and make the parent dungeon.  Once that dungeon is created, then you can go to another gravestone and then you can use the 'find glyph' option or whatever it's called to look up the specific dungeon you wanted to run, and you can create it, all without having to use your own materials.


So, if you wanted to run a specific 'cursed loran' glyph, you couldnt create a 'cursed isz' dungeon and expect to access cursed loran, but if you did create a cursed isz dungeon of your own, you could access any cursed isz chalice glyph out there by looking it up the same way mentioned above via glyphs.


Lastly, supposedly if you create a parent dungeon of your own, with all offerings, you can access any and ALL combination of those offerings via glyphs.  So if you created a cursed/fettid/rotten Ihyll, you could join any ihyl glyph, even if it was only 'cursed and fettid.'


Good luck~ 




 Have you created a chalice with those specifications already (ie, cursed/fetid/rotten)?  You have to create a chalice of that type already first, and then you can pull up the glyphs that fall under it, without having to spend your own chalice materials. 




 Yeah. Tiny tonitrus us can be pretty color though, and te cheap 15 ones (shell and paw) are definitely worth it.  




 Or how complicated the races and their primarily religious emotions and other factors are :/ 




 Have you ever been to jail?  All these tough ass motherfuckers for all their street cred who act like bad-asses immediately start bitching to their baby-sitters, the deputies, saying shit like,

"I need a band-aid"


"I need to be taken out of general because I stubbed my toe"


"I need to schedule a doctor's appointment because I spilled my milk"


I dont say this to justify the negligence on behalf of the cops, but put yourself in their shoes for a second and know that they hear all these tough guys who cop to their crimes to their fellow thugs turn into instant pussies as they try to escape the consequences of their actions, and it happens everyday, all the time.  And of course, for the street-cred, they did it, but to the cops and authority figures, they are all innocent! 




 Yep. These open-minded, sheltered kids love to tell you to be open-minded and not racist from the safety of the ivory towers their parents paid for :D 




 Yep. It shows as much as its fatally-flawed idealistic, white-bred, well-funded, open minded liberal hipster yuppie bull-shit does. Respect people, for they are equal, I say from my sheltered, ivory tower that my parents paid for.  




 Racism itself is as old as man himself. Reddit is not classical. It is new, and racism is not unique to reddit... 




 We still calling them protestors?  Lets go even further PC with it and call them 'disadvantaged urban socio-economically oppressed urban societal victims.' 




 Yep. Maybe they chose that since arcane gives you more ranged attacks with the hunter's tools?  Either way. I don't like it. Optimizing builds shouldn't be so lop-sided - easy for physical, obnoxious and redundant for most everything else.  It should be equally challenging/easy/hard/redundant.  




 Ah, that's why.  I've only completed the glyphs I've done with two of the three rites.  I think I've yet to complete a depth 5 with all three rites (as I've just used them for farming regular gems and what not).


And yes, I don't prefer this method either.  Granted, a few extra points can be negligble, especially to skilled players, still having a lot of apparently base-line-needed gems for certain weapons being so far away and hard to get is stupid imo (again, thinking those %+flat arcane gems for BoM/burial blade). 




 Right.  I've read up on a lot of the posts about ranges, and it being similar to invading further upwards beyond the original DaS equation (akin to DaS2), but even then, I know there are a lot of stubborn people sticking to 50-80, but I suppose that is why a lot of us make multiple characters at multiple ranges :D


But I also have the urge to make a new character anyhow, because I enjoy creating them, and I have this really bad-ass Lemmy Kilmister character model saved that I want to employ as more of a main character, as I have thoroughly been enjoying the SKL build, but I think it would be fun to bring the STR up to 25 for additional weapon usage.  I know my other toon would be a good template, but I might just leave him where he is.  His face is kinda ugly :D 




 Right, but all the work to get that far and farm that much at chances to even get an abysmal gem, let alone one with perfect stats, for just one weapon?  Well, that is why people flock to using Ludwig's sword, because it is OP real quick with minimal investment in the game or farming, and it's bad-ass even with the base game gems.  


I'm super annoyed and dissapointed in how FROM made competitive weapon optimizing so lop-sided, and it's a total bummer that they made it so hard to maximize a lot of weapon's potential (ie, the uncanny burial blade, as the waning slot ruins the base-line model).  


I mean, I have multiple characters, and I've farmed a lot of chalices, and I have yet to see an abyssmal gem period 


Edit:  And that's not to say it shouldn't take farming/work/effort/frustration/redundancy to optimize our theoretical top-shelf OP Tonitrus that we've been discussing, but it's a lot of work to make simple/earlier game weapons shine, like the BoM and later the Burial Blade, and use it to its max :/ 




 An be a dex fag?  No whay! 




 I have a few PvP builds, and the most current/closest one I am using is similar to yours, though I had planned it to be primarily dex, but I wanted to make a quality build anyhow, so now I just feel like I could have the best of both worlds on one toon.  Anyway, Nathan Explosion is level 98, and his stats are:

45 Vit (I think, might be 44 or 46)

22 End

12 STR

50 SKL

8 BT (whatever starter stat was)

15 Arc


I mean, I could easily adjust it to make it closer to a quality build, but I think anything over 100-110 is too high, as it cuts out a lot of meta-ranges in PvP, and is frankly just unnecessary, as I enjoy focused builds where you have to sacrafice some power/expertise over others. 




 RACISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSM!  You're so racist!  Stop justifying brutal america's crooked cops purposefully oppressing the socio-economically disenfranchised urban youths!


Just kdiding.  In all seriousness, so sick of the politically-correct bull-shit and people who choose to sympathize with stupid and ignorant people.  But hey, who needs to change when you have the perfect, perpetual victim card?  Change aint a one-way street. 




 Here's another reply for you:  Bolt (and fire) scaling works off arcane, right?  Have you tried optimizing the Tonitrus on your quality build?  How do the stats and the damage look with nore STR than arcane?  If you have tested it out for max damage on that build, what's gems have you used so far, and what does the final damage output look like? 




 And now I want to build a new character based on your quality build, as it sounds like it optimizes a lot of weapons and can make for a very diverse character... but man oh man, running all those chalices again...  :( 




 My Skill build is at 98, and close to this, with a few less end, a few more vit points, and only 12 STR.  It is tempting to move him towards this quality direction and open up so many more options on who and what is my favorite character, but I really don't want to level him up any more :( 




 Yeah.  I don't think I've seen gems like that, though I could check on my main to see if he has anything remotely close, though he is mostly retired.


Anyway, I ask because I wanted to make a quality build for PvP to have access to a variety of weapons (as variety is what has always made the souls games fun as fuck), yet remain competitive - so I wanted to use ludwig's (which I never really liked that much), the cleavers, and hearing that tonitrus can be pretty bad-ass on a quality build makes me happy as well :D


But first, I need to go find me an uncanny burial blade, and then I need %/flat arcane gems with less shitty negatives, and then, another blood rock... ugh.  Sometimes I really hate how they did rocks and weapon variants in this game  




 What does the damage look like on tonitrus with the %phys/flat arcane gems?  Seems like it could really shine on a STR build.


I've been farming those flat arc gems, but so far no luck, because I keep getting the shitty -HP gems, though the few -kin/beast damage are great for PvP.


Do you use the regular burial blade with its shitty waning slot, or do you use an uncanny burial blade?  Or  As it seems it would be able to possibly pump out the most damage (2 radial and a triangle gem slot) since triangle gems come as +9% physical with the +70 flat arcane damage, whereas, it's hard to find a decent waning gem for the burial blade, or at least, so far it has been, and I have that 18% physical gem found in the main game on it.
