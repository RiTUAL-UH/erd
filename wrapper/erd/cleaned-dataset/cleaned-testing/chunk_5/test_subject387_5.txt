 what's the difference between hot sauce and spicy ketchup? 




 I heard white belts are just tossed in with the rest of the crowd and expected to survive at the same pace as everyone else in BJJ schools and that for the first few months - you don't really learn much. Is this true? If so... it really de-motivates me to try and learn BJJ. I learn better through a more organized, progressive curriculum. :/

Can anyone give me some insight? 




 If they were professional, they should have attempted to control this out-of-line cop. 




 Why didn't the other cops try to stop him from having a power trip? 









 Hey guys you just gotta think of how many times this shit happens but it's undocumented so we never hear of it. 




 Small man syndrome. 




 That roll... who the hell does he think he is - 007? 




 Did you mostly train Judo for Sport or self defense? 




 Yeah. For all he know he might've gone to practice twice a year. 




 Stretching helps a lot with soreness especially after practice. 




 They really give out free alcohol at art museums? 




 AHHHHHHHHGHHHGHGHGHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK OH MY GOD 




 Dang, you got downvoted a lot. 




 I thought Petite meant skinny/thin/slender not short? 




 The best case scenario IS the worse case scenario... in this scenario. The kid wasn't going to die if the bus moved a few inches while his foot was stuck. 




 perfect example of busty petite. 




 That's a really good analogy. So what actual importance do grades serve?  




 Really?? 




 Thank you, friend. Happy Cake Day.

 Very informative and thorough post! I agree with your points. Thanks for your contribution to the thread, friend. Best of luck in your fitness goals. 




 Me (In my head) - "WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING? WHAT HAVEN'T I BEEN DOING? I EAT MORE GODDAMN PROTEIN EVERY DAY THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR EATS BEFORE IT HIBERNATES. I'VE BEEN HITTING THE WEIGHTS LIKE I JUST STARTED A LIFE SENTENCE IN PRISON AND MY VERY SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON GETTING SWOLE. I AM A FUCKING BEAST.


(What I actually said) - "Oh you know. Diet and exercise. Gotta stay fit. Thanks for noticing."

Fucking real. Stay humble you beast. 




 Would you say Stronglifts 5x5 coupled with carefully tracking your daily calories would be a good strength/mass program? 




 How would you recommend someone looking to make "big" progress doing a cardio-based program that incorporates weights such as P90X? 




 Do you think gradual progress through upping up the weight throughout the course would've made a big difference for these people assuming their diets were just the same as whatever they ate and drank in these 90 days? 




 As in they probably just stuck to using the same weight of dumbbells throughout the whole course?  




 So, basically Cardio while eating at maintenance will not make you leaner? I figured that if you ate at maintenance and did cardio at the same time, the cardio would burn off enough calories for you to be under maintenance at the end of the day and with consistency, you should lose weight and get leaner.

Before/After results. Is P90X to blame or is it possible they didn't follow through with the program with enough intensity? For some of these people, they actually GAINED weight, Loss Muscle Mass, AND gained bodyfat rather than lose any and make any lbm gains.

EDIT: Also, how can one avoid making no progress in their body while doing P90X?

 Is there an example of this someone can show me? 




 Artemis or Huntress is Half Viet/White 




 His arms are unreasonably, irrealistically big. 




 Wow, thank you so much for your insight, bro. You're motivating me so much right now - I wanna be able to get to your size! Going to the gym right now to get an early start on the day - thanks for all the tips!  




 Understood, friend. Thanks for the insight. One question though - if I'm starting off with low weight (less than a plate) - would I have to go deeper on my form since the weight will be closer to the ground (for ex: 25s are smaller than a 45 Plate so I would have to go down deeper for it to reach the ground or to pick it up) 




 Understood, friend! And what would you say is a good ending point for a bulk? Obviously, we have to accept that the muscle gained from a bulk comes with a degree of fat, right? So is there a weight goal that I should set before I cut again? I think you might be able to offer some good insight on this since we're both about the same height. 




 Thank you for your advice! I will start focusing on eating less, doing more cardio through Martial Arts training, and starting to be consistent on a strength training program. After I see some good definition going on - I'll start working towards a bulk. 

If I may ask another stupid question - how long do you think I should give myself before I start working towards a bulk? I'm not sure how long this will take so I don't want to try to "waste" any time per se. 




 In Stronglifts 5x5, the Barbell Row form is supposed to be set so your upper body is almost completely parallel with the floor with the bar rowed to your chest. I'm more used to the traditional barbell row with the bar rowed to your stomach with your chest up and back arched like so: http://filledfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bent-over-barbell-row.png

Would it be okay to sub what I'm used to in place of Stronglifts' Barbell Row? The form just seems dangerous and difficult and I have a hard time rowing it to my chest which makes me rethink whether or not I'm doing it correctly. 




 Also, do you think continuing Strong Lifts 5x5 would be good for me? 




 Understood, thanks for all your advice so far. I really appreciate it.

I'm just afraid, since I'm already pretty skinny, if I go under maintenance - I'm going to look anorexic. Is that a possibility since I don't have much lean muscle mass? 




 What BF % would you say I'm at right now?

And do you think I should keep below a certain number in order to try and keep it as lean as possible while trying to lean bulk? 

My goal is to be a lean 140-145 (basically my current weight but lean) but does that necessarily mean that I would have to bulk up to 165 in order to get the necessary muscle mass to cut down to? 




 I'm currently starting Stronglifts 5x5. I'm kind of frustrated at my body because I wouldn't say I'm "skinny fat" yet I'm skinny and I have no cuts, no definition whatsoever. My stomach is flat without abs and my arms aren't lean. Not quite sure what I should do because I don't want to bulk because I do Martial Arts and I don't want excess weight to hinder my speed and I don't want to get smaller in order to get cut. Hopefully that makes sense. 




 Is it possible for me, as a skinny guy (5'7, 139-140 lbs), to lean out while not losing weight? I want to see definition in my abs and arms but I don't want to get smaller. 




 Will try. :)
 




 Will try. :) 




 Does it have to do with the body mechanics of the kick itself or am I just at a low level of flexibility?

I can hold and launch a Roundhouse very well above my head height but I struggle to do so with the Side Kick.

EDIT: This is my goal: http://legalpronegotiator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/High-Kick.jpg

Is it obtainable with constant flexibility training or are men naturally limited as opposed to their female counterparts when it comes to the Side Kick due to groin flexibility? 




 Tbh this. 




 Holding target loose to avoid strain on arm = kicking force throwing the arm and "hyperextending it"

Holding target tight to avoid arm being thrown when kick hits target = putting strain on forearm and makes veins pop which equal "pain"

I've never heard of such bs. 




 My friend, who doesn't do martial arts, has been helping me out with my training outside of practice. I just ask him to hold the paddle correctly as I kick it and he complains that it hurts and hyperextends his arm. He also tells me that whenever he holds it while I'm kicking - his veins start showing on his arms and it hurts him.

I can't tell if he's being serious, if I'm somehow inadvertently hitting the target incorrectly to where he's getting injured or if he's just a lousy helper. There's little kids and older adults that hold paddles** for each other and I have **never, ever** heard any of them complain that holding the paddle was hurting their arm. If the kick misfires and hits their actual hand, wrist, or arm then it's understandable. But this... I have never heard of until now.

Edit: Paddles not Padded 




 I was joking

 Oh, I definitely agree with you. Or was this a reply to roninsascha? I just thought it was very ironic that he was criticizing the kicking frequency of a Taekwondo practitioner, let alone a Red Belt. 




 Oh, hey friend. Check this video out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-1-Y4Mnro

This is the same song interpreted in dance by an advanced Taekwondo group known as the K-Tigers since if you were interested in that :) 




 Definitely not mocking them, but, in my honest opinion - that form at the beginning can be perfected by absolutely anyone with repetition. It definitely doesn't look like they had enough practice for this demonstration. 




 You didn't catch the White and Green Belts at the beginning of the video? All the kicks and forms are legitimate forms practiced in actual Taekwondo Dojangs but, for the most part - in this scenario, they were executed with bad technique. 




 This is a great answer. 




 Don't listen to that guy. lol

I'm sure you kick way more often than he does. 




 I have the same problem when I practice quick footwork on the mat. I get mat burn on my skin and sometimes it'll peel off and create blisters. When that happens I just wrap my blisters with gauze and tape so I can continue practicing while the blister can heal properly. It'll take awhile but it works for me and it'll work for you too.

As for prevention... I don't quite know the answer to that, tbh. Perhaps wearing in-door TKD shoes? 




 For a guy that's nearly a Black Belt in Taekwondo, I don't think kicking frequency is the problem. lol 




 No protection omg 




 Definitely looked like they didn't rehearsed beforehand at all before performing. :/ 









 Thank you for the explanation. 




 The super speed also comes with the super tardiness. 




 But Superboy is also half-human, not full Kryptonian.  That still applies though? 




 too soon 




 Superboy is a hybrid clone created by Cadmus as well as Red Arrow (non-hybrid though). However Red Arrow seems to age physiologically while Superboy maintains in youthful apperance throughout the timeskip. It's hinted in the series that Superboy will never appear to age.

My question is, why can Red Arrow age yet Superboy can't despite both being Cadmus clones?  




 Maybe he wasn't telling a lie but the girl wasn't actually cute.
