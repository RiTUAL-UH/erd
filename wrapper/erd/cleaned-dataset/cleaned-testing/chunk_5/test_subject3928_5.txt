 Happy Holidays!!! 




 where's the star at the end, bro? 




 Hm, good point. I figured liquor was an easy fix, but it's probably the best option. Thanks for the tip!  




 I like it.  




 I've been working as an assistant for the past year and a half and my boss and I get along great. He's gotten me really cool and thoughtful gifts for both Christmas and my birthday, but for the life of me, I can't think of a good Christmas gift for him. 

Any ideas of what I can get a family-man around 45 who loves toys and TV shows? 

 




 what a card! 









 yes.  




 I'll pay you $30 to eat it.  




 coooooool 




 lol!  




 best. 




 i sympathize
