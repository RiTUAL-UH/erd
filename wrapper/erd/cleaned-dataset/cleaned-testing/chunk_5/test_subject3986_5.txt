 IT Cosmetics celebration foundation is cruelty free! its a nice matte that looks flawless if you can buff it correctly

also, if youre willing to pay $$$ for a lip product i'd recommend either Melt Cosmetics or the new ABH liquid lipsticks :)

 [srs] met chloe at a cosplay convention and she is one of the nicest people ever, not gonna lie. she gave compliments and tips to all the fans she met and seemed pretty down to earth.  i do think she oversexualizes cartoon/movie/comic book characters, but hey, its cosplay.
