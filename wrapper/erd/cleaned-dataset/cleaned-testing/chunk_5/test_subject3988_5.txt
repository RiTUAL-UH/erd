 It takes more muscles to have your mouth open than to keep it closed!

First time that fact has actually come in useful for me..! 




  Kick yourself in the ass to get up, be positive, and look at today as a whole new day of opportunity everywhere you go! No one is going to do it for you. You are the only one in your way. So what are you waiting for?

I'm 99% sure that you are not a working psychologist, though there must be a few bad ones out there. I'm 100% sure you have never been through depression. That is absolutely not how it works.. you are telling someone who appears to have a chemical imbalance in their brain to 'snap out of it'. People with depression will struggle desperately to get out of bed, take a shower or do some work for hours. OP even tells you he struggles for two hours each day to stand up- if he could just get over that don't you think he has tried it already? 

As someone who was clinically depressed I thought I was lazy for a very long time, but it didn't make sense to me because I tried so hard  and wanted to do so badly the things that I used to do with ease. Shame on you for not admitting your ignorance and possibly making this guys struggle even worse. He needs medical help and therapy to assist that medical help, not this pseudopsychology 'just think positive!' crap. 




 As someone who has actually gone through clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder, I think it is fair to say that for most people it isn't laziness. I have had days where I have sat in front of a computer trying to will myself to work for twelve hours straight and just can't, full on wrestling matches with myself in my own head to try to get out of bed. After a while of this stuff piling up you deserve to acknowledge that you are mentally ill, give yourself a break and not be labelled lazy. I'm not sure the 'psychologist' really knows what they are talking about, no serious psychologist/psychiatrist I have seen has ever gone down that route with me.

Take some time for getting better. Keep working out. Try meditation for focus (its easy to learn a few techniques online and it helps to train you to take control over your own mind). Get into a daily routine as best you can. Most people go through 4, 5, 6 different medications to find one that works for them because everyone's brains develop differently so keep going with that. Most of all, stay positive. It will pass eventually, try not to focus on your depression too much, keep treating it and eventually this will pass no matter what shit you have to go through between now and then. Maybe you'll have to take a regular job for a short while, who cares? You will always have time to start another business in the future.
