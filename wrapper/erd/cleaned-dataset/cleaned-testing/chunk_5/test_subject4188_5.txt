 WTF is up with Lee's neck? 









 Well, will wee be seeing Riddler's bowler hat or Penguin's top hat any time soon

Also, Cat is basically like her future self but more leather needed

Ivy who I adore wears a Freddy Krueger style jumper, maybe latex will be her thing when she gets older

Not talking about Batman yet but maybe the final scene in season two will have him fall down the well to be surrounded by bats, that would be a fitting end to season two 




 They need to use less sex but more quirks, if she has some odd habits would be entertaining, maybe she goes off drink and pursues a few interests, it would be good to see her in public places doing normal things and having opinions, we need some dynamics now and less lesbian coke scenes 




 Well done lad and well said 




 Is it just me or did she kind of enjoy pummelling Barbara's head on the floor

I think also in scenes especially the Jerome episode, she did seem a bit snappy

So it's my guess that maybe she will turn bad while Barbara will turn good

She does seem secretive so will have some skeletons in the closet am sure

We have all seen Barbara's so maybe when Leslie turns sour, Babs could have redemption

I think it would be good for Babs that Leslie may do something damaging for Gordon and Babs picks up on it and does something heroic to save Gordon which could either be the making / breaking of Babs

Leslie on the other hand could have been anything before working in Arkham but nothing was said about her past, I think she will show her true colours soon, hopefully 




 Can anyone get any cuter than her, she's a perfect little puddy tat 




 Any local services that can reverse a fridge freezer door please? 




 This site doesn't show GIFs, what a bummer  




 There has been a pitch cam for months but now is the time we filmed the new scoreboard installation, we need setting up, retuning, collaborating settings and finally a Blu-ray 




 Come on guys, let's have an epic display of GIFs till the files are reopended lol 




 Come on guys, let's have an epic display of GIFs till season two arrives lol
