 Common misconception. Sure, it's not affordable for some but I went to one for like 10k a year (including a full semester in another country). Hardly anybody pays full price. 




 Pass the cream m8? I gotta wank it. 




 I was 16, and at my friends lake house. He had two incredibly hot sisters, tall, tan, and blonde. Even better, they brought friends. My friend and I had a room upstairs while all the girls were downstairs. In the middle of the night I wanted some water, so I went downstairs. Their door was cracked open as I passed so I looked inside, being the nosy teenager I was. I saw all four girls naked, scissoring eachother and I made this all up I'm so lonely fuck valentines day

 Hate it? Downvote. Keep captions away! 




 Yada yada yada he dies. 




 "Mom, what happens if I pull my eyes out?"  

"They'll turn into applesauce."  

Queue intrusive thoughts every time I got hungry... 




 Get some liquid novacaine (numbs teeth) from the drug section of your favorite supermarket and use q-tips to apply it around your anus.

You won't feel the burn. I've tried it on multiple occasions.  




 I want the game because I want a challenge!  




 What are you studying? 




 Spare a squirt? 




 I usually tab it if I want to look at multiple ones while browsing the front page.  




 You've stolen the suspense from everyone else. And for what? A little karma???  

You monster.  




 OP, this is pretty darn creative! Did you use real stones?  




 I'll trim scam you.  




 Quit watching Fox and the world will be less-uneducated.  




 I can see this without captions and people still getting the noise.  




 Oh got it! OP's BF fucked up. 




 Yeah I bet!  




 You're right, I totally missed that. Now I get it!  

Thanks for the explanation!  




 So essentially you asked her about something that the two of you have discussed...  

How is this a fuck up?  




 Then you piss all over yourself because you never have a poop without a pee. 




 If you can post a great Mol recipe that's not out of a glass bottle, do it. 




 Mine might be a little screwy, I'll check the box and it will make me do a captcha.  




 I believe he said 'redchannit" 




 hahaha "[subthread on redchanit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7faUHdlh9g#t=252)" 

reddit + 4chan 




 And users were so upset when this policy changed?

Now we hardly ever think about it. It's just normal to us. 




 The three Muslim students that were killed in the Chapel Hill shooting yesterday. Reddit barely covered them, so I thought I should, to get that sweet sweet karma.

FTFY OP 









 TIL that 'relevant' was just 'revent' before reddit.  




 Maybe it was an act of sportsmanship?   

"Let's stop racing because this other team crashed and some might be injured." 




 It looks like just a circumference marker around the pin.

There's a text box at the top that requires you to enter a captcha to submit.  

You don't actually have to submit in order to see the text.

 Have you seen FMA: Brotherhood?

 Thanks! I used the tool and found that the nearest physical location they sell it at to me is 300+ miles away. 




 Are you able to find their bread in stores? If so, where?

FTFY 




 HA! YES! No more Garfield!! 




 Thank you! 




 Where did you find a link to purchase?  




 And not to mention barbaric voter laws that prevent underrepresented citizens from casting a ballot and [gerrymandering](https://www.google.com/search?q=gerrymandering rlz=2C1KMZB_enUS0537US0537 oq=gerrymandering aqs=chrome..69i57.2149j0j7 sourceid=chrome es_sm=93 ie=UTF-8).

This will cause dehydration.  




 I'm not quite sure I get it. Would you mind explaining it to me? 




 Or a [bear](http://rippedclub.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/download-bear.jpg)? 




 Your cheers... my emotions! 









 I'd pay the most expensive escort to give me a week long BJ. 




 I'd love to do some kind of comedy work. Just try it out.  

I live in a rural area and I'm trying hard to find a job in a big city that has comedy clubs just to take a crack at it.  

Even if I suck the big one, at least I tried.  




 Climate Denier? Not welcome.  

 




 Ah social constructs...

 Does your family know that I'm going to eat you?

 Betty White, Clint Eastwood, and they're doing it on that chair that Clint was talking to a couple of years back.  




 For me it's when I drive past a car that is the exact same car as mine and I start waving and pointing and giving a 'thumbs up'!  

I can't be the only one, no? I drive (it's temporarily out-of-service) a 94 honda accord coupe DX. It's a unique experience.  




 First, I'll upvote because not one responder has.  

Second, it's not that unusual. My first time was pretty scary, I woke up in my bed but knew something wasn't right. So I was just yelling at myself in my dream "WAKE UP! WAKE UP! YOU NEED TO WAKE UP!"  

After 5 dream-minutes I woke up. It's only happened one other time since then and it was so long ago. Like 13 years ago. I never forgot it.  




 A robot that is so lifelike that people can mistake it for a real human being.   

My job requires an immense amount of relationship building and customer service.    




 [Sally Field](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000398/?ref_=tt_cl_i2), she is beautiful.

 HEY FUCK YOU PAL.

 I thought I was in /r/funny for a sec. 




 Agreed! 




 I too, watched the film. 




 You don't love the tale, you love the karma. 




 Gotcha, I should repost this every six months:

 Wow! Fuck them! 




 There are 6 billion people in the world, I can guarantee that you aren't alone in anything. 




 spacial awareness

Just like OP! 




 They sent me the same letter/email for 3 months straight.  

I never called in, I never upgraded, and the never forced me to upgrade.  
 
I believe it's just a scare tactic. And if what they did to me is similar to what they do to others, it should be illegal. 




 I have cable one too!

Don't worry, they sent me the same emails for 3 months and never did shit.

They're all bark and no bite.  




 I don't get it.  




  Portmanteau n.  

a large trunk or suitcase, typically made of stiff leather and opening into two equal parts.

or (in this context)  

**consisting of or combining two or more separable aspects or qualities.**

For all those that would like to save time.

 




 Also more urban legend: 

When they drop the worm in, if it dies before it hits the bottom it's a good bottle of mescal.  




 Nah man! People eat bugs in other countries for great reasons! They're abundant, they are a cheap source of protein, they are delicious! 




 Chapulines!

Dude, they are fucking tasty!  




 I believe it was super similar to sunflower seeds. I'd definitely eat it again! 




 On mountains high  
Where rivers flow  
Sat an old user  
With mysterious glow  
  
Could be the scotch  
Could be the gin  
Could be the shine  
Off his rear end  

It bounced down below  
To a town most quaint   
And made all the women  
Quiver and faint  

As bright as the sun  
As hot as sin  
Don't worry man  
It's just test_subject4255   




 And legend has it that they'll drop the worm in the bottle. If it dies before it hits the bottom, it's a good bottle of mescal.  




 It's a species of worm that feeds on the plant. It is just a worm, not a hallucinogen. 

There is a dish served in that area that is a bunch of the worms fried up. I've had it, it's pretty good! 




 HIMYM

 




 Eat the worm! It won't kill you.

 THAT WAS GREAT! 




 The market only works if EVERYONE is paying.  




 Have my axe.  




 Not if I can help it 




 That was rude 




 I read it all and this is exactly how I feel about it.  

When I didn't have the flair, I wanted it so bad and I got frustrated when people were getting in within a minute.  

Now that I have it, I've stopped playing. I want others to have a shot at that glorious feeling that comes after acquiring such a difficult flair.

 How do you use it?  




 Any ones with the great commercials would be preferred if that's an option.  




 CONGRATS! 




 Lose the captions!!! 




 I have this phobia where I don't ever want to smell like ass.

I bought a bidet for that reason and I'm not around it (at work, etc.) I make sure to wet some TP before pooping to get my ass clean.

 To each his own. I don't hoard flairs. 




 Eh, I just want others to have a chance.
