 My wife and I are the same but with a baby added, so work, baby, netflix in addition to mandatory grandparent visits every few days 




 I'm having a replacement phone sent to me, but I'd like to back everything up to make the transition as smooth as possible and then wipe the old one because it has to get sent back in 









 That's the ultra hybrid one I found lol 




 Do you have a link to the slim hybrid? I can't seem to find it  




 
1. Thanks I'll take extra care for that bit

2. Hmm I've never heard anyone say they had that problem with the slim armor case before. I'm not worried about bulk because it looks about the same as the supcase I already have, and I like the look of the slim armor. I'd get the ultra hybrid because I don't drop my phone but I drive a big rig so I don't want to risk it falling from that height without proper protection. 

3. I don't exactly like the look of full body skins, I was thinking something clear. I'm just worried about scuffing my phone while it's in the case because the one I'm replacing got scuffs from the supcase

Thanks for the tips 




 I loved it because it gave me more of a feeling that he was young and cold blooded versus his more sympathetic self in lotr 




 I'm getting my M8 replaced because of a cracked camera lens. Since I'm doing the advanced exchange program I will be losing my tempered glass screen protector, just the price I pay for not wanting to be without my m8 for lore than an hour. 

I currently have the supcase because I thought I would end up using the IR blaster a lot but I haven't been at all so I'm ordering the spigen slim armor case and a nilkin tempered glass protector since it also comes with one's for the camera lenses. 

That leads me into my question: what about full body skins? Even with my supcase on, dirt and dust gets inside and I have scuffs on the edges of my phone that I'd rather not have. Anyone use a full body skin in addition to a shell case? 




 Yeah I've experienced similar and heard the same. Nice people running the businesses. I deliver West of Billings though, so I don't have to deal with the grumps here. I feel like the closer you get to billings the more ornery the people get 




 TIL there's a mascot of the year thing  




 Also no truck drivers  




 Crow Agency by comparison is a cake walk. I've dealt with nicer people there than  I have in Billings.  




 And then on the southeast side is crow agency. Same exact deal. One of my old coworkers rescued a pup from there. Lured him into his delivery truck and took him to the vet to get shots and whatnot  




 I'm heights and I'm definitely only 30, just checked. I guess I'll have to call 




 I wonder if billings got the boost too  




 Aside from some wasted time, everyone won 




 I also put diesel treat in the tank every time I fuel in the cold 




 Let's get the most obvious one out of the way:
Have a fucking hammer on hand 




 The HE machines I have now seem to work fine but I don't work in a kitchen anymore so I'm not sure. I'm iffy on these HE machines though. I feel like they don't use enough water to get some really bad dirt out  




 Could have been that too. We used the old crappy machines that kept breaking down in our apartment complex  




 Ah fuck well you got me there. I wouldn't want ride a bus or train smelling like ball soup 




 You have to wear alternate clothes between your house and work? If that's so that's is bullshit.  




 It's awfully nice of your employer to provide a locker room for you to change your clothes in. Oh wait, they probably don't and you're changing into your work clothes in the bathroom. Do you change back into your "Street clothes"  after you're good and greasy after a long shift? I go home and shower before I contaminate anything else because that's disgusting and why do I need to soil two sets of clothes? For professionalism? I think you have that backwards unless you park underground and have a secret entrance where customers don't see you. Some restaurants make you walk through the front door. I think it's more professional to show up ready to work. But yeah you have fun changing in that handicap stall or better yet, the tiny stall if the handicap one is taken.  




 Maybe that's what I was missing because I used plenty of detergent and used two fabric softener things in the dryer but by the time I went to go out the pants on for work they smelled like Olive Garden still  




 I don't even work in a restaurant and I know how this feels. I work such long hours most days that I come home, shower and go straight to sweats or pajama pants. I own several pairs of regular pants but I only seem to wear the same shirt and pants because by the time I go to wear them again, they've been washed and are the first things I grab from the drawer and closet.  




 Space Frog: Space Mission 




 Five nights at lowbread's 




 I haven't looked at the app but an idea that would give them incentive to update the list is that there could be an option to enable push notifications for every time a brewery updates their list. That would guaranteed that if it isn't seen, at least someone with the app would be reminded of said brewery, instead of the off chance they visit the website or Facebook decides to show them an update on their feed 




 Yep xerq.io 




 As someone in Montana, I've never used snow tires on my Mustang and it's my only car so it gets use all winter 




 1997 Ford Mustang  




 Basically yes. All the super expensive biked are basically meant for professional athletes, the lighter the bike, the less movement resistance they have.  




 After the 500-700 range you really don't get better durability with bikes, it's all about weight of the bike  




 As someone living in Montana I actually find it difficult to tell who is a hipster and who is a redneck sometimes  




 Even better if they're just what you have on hand. They'll match the furniture by not matching anything  




 Which is weird because mason jar everything was a redneck thing  




 Ah, I was wondering what the hell kind of bridge blocks water from flowing  




 What bridge is this?  I've never heard of such a thing  




 Laziness breeds efficiency  




 Imagine the frustration of teaching them how to use the safety as well as trigger discipline.  




 And the amount being used by your company are all relatively trained with firearms. I can't imagine how much would be used training a ton of primitive people who haven't even seen a gun before  




 In all honesty any decent place you find will be fine. I've seen some shitty ass apartments with decent heat in them. My recommendation is to find a place with a stove or fireplace. Firewood is relatively inexpensive and then you only need to use the gas or electric heat as backup.  




 [Well I'm never going down to Florida ever again and it was nice never knowing you, the rest of those areas] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Amblyomma_americanum_range_map.svg/440px-Amblyomma_americanum_range_map.svg.png)  




 Yeah and 60 degrees is cold for your Santa Monica ass 




 Porn with multiple locations is pretty fancy  




 Would a regular drill press not work? I mean I can literally put any bit into the chuck 




 I almost bought the dremel press thing, but I opted for a regular drill press because I found a used one for a great deal. It also doubles as a rotary sander, and the guy included the stand with it. Takes up more space but totally worth it for the versatility. I only have a tiny space to work with so having two bigger tools in one is great  




 I notice this about every "moving to montana" post. People acting like the person is moving into the winter apocalypse. My parents got me chains for my tires years ago but I haven't used them in over 5 or 6 years because I haven't needed them, even with how bad the last few winters were. I've never worn boots unless I'm hunting, I dress in pants, a t-shirt and a decent coat and I've only recently started wearing a hat now that I've elected to shaving my hair.

Winter is doable without having extreme gear but I suppose it may be necessary for people not used to the cold weather up here since how temperature seems to be perceived is relative to what you're used to 




 But also be aware of how deep the ruts are, don't want to get high centered 




 I lived in an apartment with baseboard heaters for over two years. My electricity bill was low (even with running 2 computers continuously) and my apartment was always warm.

I had friends who didn't use their heater and used portable heaters and I hated going over there during the winter because it was too damn cold. 




 I think the most adorable tool I've ever seen was an attachment to make a dremel into a mini drill press 




 Wow this looks really cool. I like everything but I don't think the tub fits in. With all the effort you already went through with the tile, a matching tile tub would have been awesome. (probably not comfortable though)  




 This is what I do 




 No kidding, I always go and never find anything  




 Even more disgusting is the limitations set on how much of the supplies teachers can use and many end up spending out of their own pockets to provide for their students. Meanwhile millions goes to facilities and buying brand new computers every other year.  




 Yeah it seems like the Jack is slightly too big. I bought an audio cable from monoprice and it doesn't stay in my phone, but my older cables I have fit just fine 




 I was going to say Streamline Late night is most reliable but then I realized today is Wednesday and they probably unfortunately aren't running  




 I would argue that a chef is anyone who has control/collaboration/contribution to the menu. 

A cook is someone who just follows instruction without actually really knowing the cooking process like production line workers. For example, is an assembly line worker for something like a car a master mechanic who knows how to build or fix any part of that car? It's just simple tasks that can be repeated over and over quickly without any thought.  




 I wanted to start making a rubber band ball from all the asparagus that we went through but I could never get anyone else to contribute so I have up 




 Fucking kipkay videos. I used to like his short little videos but nowadays he has unnecessary intros and over half of his video is an audible ad or promoting his premium website  




 Hands down /r/unexpectedthuglife  




 Ebaumsworld also ripped it off

 Where can I find out which my state is?  




 I couldn't get into it. The longer I played the more bored I got  




 Have one for pork?  




 Seeing the consoles at that angle makes me really uncomfortable regardless of how secure it is  




 That sounds amazing. Two topics I don't generally like talking about to other people and a society where where they don't talk about them to each other 




 So basically what you're saying is that with most lodges, people who practice one of the many forms of paganism could possibly be welcome? (seriously asking)  




 Thanks. I was also looking into locking casters because I also have a small work area. My toolbox is on casters and can be moved. 

We also looked at a bench at Sam's club. Basically it's a nice big flat top with metal supports and legs. Half of my toolbox can roll underneath it, the other half I'd have to mount on a board with casters to fit it underneath. 

The pros are it would free up some workspace having the toolboxes underneath it, and it's obviously sturdier. The cons are that I'd have to drill my own bench dog holes, get my own vice to attach to it, and with the legs being metal, I might not be able to attach casters to it 




 This is definitely the way to go. You don't want to just have the wires going directly from the switch, into a hole in the wall, the  out a hole in the wall and to your device. It's probably also against code so if you were ever looking to sell you'd have to fix it anyway, might as well do it right.  




 Halo channel is one of the worst apps ever. Today I was watching spartan ops videos and after a video was over, the next episode was on the screen for me to immediately play so I played it, and the fucking audio was in Chinese or something. I went back through the unintuitive menus to select the episode again and then it was in English  




 If you want bang for your buck get inquisition as it's the longest game ever 




 I haven't done it yet as I've lived in apartments but a future project in my parents house will be just that. We did a complete remodel of one of the TV rooms and set that up for multiple cat5e cables in two areas where they could possibly hang a TV. The house has a specific design where we are able to run several lines through a pipe into the attic from the basement and from there lines were dropped and pulled down to the top floor rooms where there are existing phone or power lines. The rest of the house aside from the one that was already torn up can have lines be pushed up from the basement. In most houses you would end up needing to tear up sections of your drywall and repair them to run cables.  




 I just don't know how it can be programmed for so many variables like that. Just in my small town, there is parallel parking downtown, and some side streets have diagonal parking along the street. Then there are limitations on how far away from a corner you can be, or you can't Park in front of a fire hydrant, or there could be an alley access. Unless there is a universal parking method everywhere, I can't see the possibility of taking the human out of the equation.  




 I did that a few weeks ago. It said I'd get updates by email and I haven't even gotten anything saying it's being reviewed yet  




 So what about roads not marked or incorrectly marked roads on Google maps? Google nav always directs people the wrong way to my house because one end of my street connects to another road but is closed off by a gate only for emergency vehicles, but there's no indication of that in Google maps. And what about driveways or residential parking?  




 This is why I haven't done one here yet. I did one on a smaller website and my santa got my 6month son a new outfit, my wife a gift card to nordstrom, and for myself, a few things from my amazon wishlist, like curry powder, a doorstop alarm, a magnetic fridge newton's cradle from think geek, and a fucking rc quadrocopter 




 This is my ideal setup but I've been living in apartments so wiring isn't an option, but it's essentially how were going to wire my parent's house  




 Both will work fine honestly. It's unlikely that you'll need cat6 in the near or even far future but whoever owns the place after you might be grateful  




 I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at here 




 Where your coax line comes in for the Internet, you'll want a router. If it's a convenient location you can have a wireless router there. Then from that wire you'll want to connect to a gigabit switch and then from that switch you'll run cat5/6 to all your rooms. If you need more devices in certain rooms you can either run multiple wires or you can have a small switch in the rooms you need more wires in. Myself personally, I'd rather have a big switch and run all the wires to it rather than have 4 switches. Yes, you'll need power to the switch. Just remember: only one router. 

The common setup I hear of is having a non-wireless router where the coax comes in, and then you put one or two wireless access points throughout the house from the switch.  




 Thanks for pointing that out. I didn't know there was a standard for bench dogs 




 Yes it is  




 Thanks for the tips I'll check them out  




 So would you recommend it for that vice alone?  




 You're right. 

My problem is I'm still building my toolset and I don't have a lot of skills yet. Have a link to any plans for a good workbench for a compact place?  




 What's up with the placement of 10 of the bench dogs? They aren't aligned with the vice

 I have one of those spatulas, I like it but it gets a little sketchy with how small it is considering I make 14" pizzas  




 Those cutters are nice to have. Not as much dragging the toppings around like with a wheel. I like having a big one though, I have a small light one and I have to use it slow, unlike the big ones I uses to use at the pizza place I worked at and could cut a whole pizza in like a second 




 Care to explain for someone who has never owned it?  




 Your itty-bitty little kitty is kind of a dick 




 Goddamn that made my hair stand up 




 What is this even from?  




 I can't believe I watched that whole thing and I regret none of it  




 I agree. There's no excuse that Dragon Age Origins can have a skill wheel to access every one of my skills but not in Inquisition. The quick actions are nice for real time play but it's nice to have other less use abilities at my full disposal  




 I think it's crazy that black cats are harder to adopt. I adopted a black cat, not through a shelter, but from a family that had not been properly taking care of him. He is literally the best cat anyone could ever have 




 Looks like Kaarma is getting some karma 




 Yeah I'm pretty sure it's locally known as the Sheraton because that's what it used to be and people still call it that  




 Scheels? I think you're mistaken, that is an Underarmor store 




 I'm in this boat. My wife's family has a dish they cook during the holidays where you toss pork chops into a crockpot with several bulbs of garlic and let them marinate for an entire day in red wine vinegar and then cook them overnight. The entire house smells of garlic and vinegar for at least 2 weeks afterwards  




 Ended up picking it up. I have an older harmony remote but since having a TV, Receiver, and two consoles with CEC, I haven't had much if a use for universal remotes 




 Little Ricky has hated swaddling since month 1.5-2. Sometimes sleep sacks work if we don't put his arms through the holes but a lot of the time he gets upset that his arms aren't free so the only option sometimes is to hold your hand there and keep him from knocking the pacifier out until he drifts asleep. We contemplated getting that thing we saw on Shark Tank which is essentially like a sleep sack but with no arm holes and just extra room where the holes would be so he isn't cramped up but I'll be damned if we have to spend $40 on something like that when we could buy a yard of baby plaid for like $5 and make one ourselves. Luckily it isn't big enough of an issue to resort to that 




 They got like at least 15 morale boost points bro 




 I would argue he was the first, second, fourth, and fifth army  




 I call him Ricky Bobby because when he's trying to sleep he doesn't know what to do with his hands. They gravitate towards his face, pull his pacifier out and rub his eyes keeping him awake and subsequently making him upset that he's not asleep 









 Oddly enough it's the same as the thumbnail for the video  




 I find gas fireplaces unappealing to watch

 Man when I first heard about this I didn't have money to subscribe but I should now 




 Except this was actually a circle that was actually a portal so it is more worthy to be here than most I've seen 




 Yep, it will trickle down just like shit rolls uphill 




 Doritos Dew it right 




 Now put then between blue waffles  




 It definitely helps having a significant other that makes money. I unfortunately had to leave the industry because I wasn't making enough money with my first son on the way and a wife still finishing her degree (that won't net her a good job anyway) and we both feel that it's best to have someone be home for him until he starts school. But hey maybe I'll be able to pay off my student loans and save money for a food truck... Someday  




 It's the only fitting end for a chef 




 I usually use recipes as a base guideline  




 It was awesome. Just enough to make it not taste like regular chocolate chip cookies but it was just subtle  




 After 21 years in kitchens, how is your financial outlook? Especially after 16 different restaurants. 21 years is about 2 thirds of most everyone's careers. When do you think you'll retire?  




 Please God don't leave Android out 




 Sounds like you made a completely different recipe then lol. I also live at a higher elevation so I'll have to try your way next time 




 I made this recipe yesterday, turned out really awesome! I added some cocoa powder and cinnamon to the dry ingredients because why the fuck not 




 [This one happened about 20 minutes away from where I live last year](http://youtu.be/BmNdCH42tFE)  




 Body cameras is certainly a step in the right direction

 Lasagna  




 Oh man if I wasn't driving when I heard that I'd have been rolling on the floor. It really takes something to make me scream with laughter when I'm by myself driving  




 That podcast is the highlight of my week 




 There's a lot of new things and changed things, and when I try to look up some information, most places assume you've been playing every generation 




 Oh wow I didn't pay attention to the title and actually thought the black bit was a silhouette of a space ship 




 It was basically made because minecraft was giving the cold shoulder to Windows Mobile  




 People still pirate PC games?  




 I don't mind it really. I remember Dragon Age Origins having an awful inventory and the original mass effect was a nightmare. I can definitely see the inventory being cumbersome on PC. I can also understand where they're coming from with the random valuables dropping from enemies. It always feels tacky to me when things like demons or mabari drop gold, so selling those for gold makes sense. 

That being said, there's no excuse for not having any sort of storage in your stronghold, especially for a game that requires you to collect so many crafting materials in order to upgrade potions, armor, and weapons weapons, as well as re-equipping any potion that isn't your standard healing potion 




 Yeah, gingerbread sounds better than ground gingerbread  




 Make a kickstarter  




 I started at hard right off the bat. Haven't had much complaints about the AI at all 




 One of my favorite Christmas movies to watch  




 Thanks for the explanation. I didn't actually play the second game, just watched most of my wife's playthrough. Either way I'm not happy they ruined him 




 Thanks for doing this 




 Anders was awesome in origins. Fuck what they did to him in Dragon Age 2 




 I think something I really miss is the quick weapons toggle in Dragon Age Origins. They combined a lot of the good things about both games but a few are still gone. I liked that I could have two different sets of weapons and skills equipped to the skill buttons so I could change weapon sets mid combat. Like let's say my rogue was sitting back and shooting arrows and suddenly I'm the target, I switch to knives and fight close combat now. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I also thought origins had different arrows with different abilities you could equip. 

Another thing I miss is having access to every skill in your party via the skill wheel.  




 Tactical view is awesome as well. My only gripe about that though is that you can't move far enough away from your character 




 I find myself frustrated with many of the same things as him but I am really enjoying it. Having a lot of problems doesn't necessarily mean it isn't enjoyable  




 This was probably what I was going to do but I wanted to be concise lol. I've tried mixing in chocolate chips before and they all end up at the bottom so sprinkling is the best option  




 The first question you'd need to ask is if it's possible for him to work 50 hours per week. Overtime is becoming increasingly rare for hourly employees, employers would rather put employees on salary and make then work 60 hours per week since they don't have to pay overtime that way. 

Is 50 hours sustainable long term? The employer could say yes but then after a month or two decide to cut back.

Lastly, I feel there would have to be some compromise with your husband. It's great that you want to have more direct control over your child! But your husband is basically going to be working an extra 2 hours per day, so if he was 9-5, now he's working 9-7. I work 5 days a week but it's hours based on the work being done, basically I work until I'm done. I know what a huge difference an 8 hour day versus a 10 hour day can be. It feels like it takes longer to unwind at home and when you're finished with dinner it seems like it's bed time already. 

That all being said, I think having one parent being at home until they're old enough to be in school is the best situation. Daycares are so expensive and it seems like unless both parents have a good paying full time job, daycare isn't even worth it. My wife asked if she should go back to working but any money she'd make would go back into child care so I'd rather have her have all that bonding time with our son
