 Dang! Nice! 




 Whereat, if I may ask? 




 Judging by the comments, shaming rich people? I intended it as a means to bring awareness to the poverty America still deals with, yet often times is ignored in media (probably because it's a systemic problem that isn't very sensational). 




 If you don't mind my asking, where do you live? I feel like in the regions most struck by poverty opportunities for advancement rarely present themselves.  




 Well, yes. About thirty years ago though, minimum wage was enough to survive on.  




 Right, agreed. It would indeed have to be rich folks who inherited their money. 




 Fame? Charity? 




 Agreed. I don't recall saying anything to the contrary :) 




 Publicity? Fame? 




 Yes! I like this too! 




 Some people can't get loans? How are they going get out of the situation where the only available jobs are minimum wage? 




 That would be nice, but how many of them would want to go for a double-digit number of months without the privilege they're accustomed to?   




 Huh. Intriguing! I'll definitely check it out! 




 I don't quite think that's what we're going for here... 




 Right. Of course :) 




 I like it! 




 Oh right! Whoops :p 




 Then we take out the show and just make it reality! Viva la revolution! 




 I do believe there are people trying to support families on minimum wage. Jobs are hard to come by, so people take what they can, which is typically insufficient. Also note that the minimum wage hasn't gone up with inflation over the past 30 years.
