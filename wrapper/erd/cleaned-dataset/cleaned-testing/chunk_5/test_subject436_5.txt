 "We remove what we're required to remove by law" is CYA-speech meaning "we'll do the bare minimum to make sure we don't get sued or arrested." Clearly reddit has a ton of other subreddits that host very illegal content, and their continual survival means that the admins don't think it's worth their time to actively look for these things unless there's a hint of trouble. They could just be honest and say "we don't have the manpower to monitor everything", but they clearly went the moral rationalization route about free speech and self-governance. 




 The worse problem is the efficiency at which the fappening and its spawned subreddits were removed, but while other subreddits that link to clearly illegal shit remain online. As administrators they have access to absolutely everything on the site -- does that mean they actively don't remove illegal content until the public catches it? If the answer is yes then the site should just admit that all they are doing is CYA bullshit instead of claiming to have actual free speech principles. 




 There are plenty of things on reddit that are clearly very illegal, but the admins don't do anything to remove them. You could argue "but nobody sent in a complaint!". Reddit could easily and probably do have a program to monitor for questionable content/content to remove (how else could they remove all fappening subreddits so quickly?) but they actively choose not to apply it to other things. 




 TL;DR the only reason why we took things down was because of DMCA, but we'll try to frame it in a morally relatable way that will backfire on the community. 




 What you are basically saying and other admins on reddit have said are that the only types of content that will ever be removed from reddit are (a) ones that violate copyright, (b) child pornography, and (c) personally identifiable information. Everything else is a total free-for-all.

This is the disconnect that you have with large swaths of the reddit community. Not only are those three categories occupy such a narrow range of topics, but yishan's earlier post suggests that the discussion is more or less closed on how reddit censors content. Also, these three categories are also conveniently ones that will get you in trouble with litigation or law enforcement, which makes it seem like a total CYA move.

Please, try to understand this perspective from the community's point of view. If you are going to actively censor content, you have to do it in a less tone-deaf fashion. 




 Alternative translation: "Not our problem unless you send the correct paperwork." Seriously, it sends a really bad message that the site isn't going to be proactive. Not to mention that a DMCA takedown request only covers a vary narrow category of objectionable digital content. 




 RPG video games. Not sure when it started (probably at some point during college), but doing the whole character creation and open world thing lost its appeal. 




 Our facility has been around for a very long time. I'm pretty sure some of the bottles in the chemical room date back to the 1990s. There are many other labs with even older things.

Most reagents never go bad. 




 Chinese guy here, raised in Canada. Judging by what goes on in college, my impression is that everyone has sex but nobody talks about it. 




 What about the Tcho chocolate factory? That's a pretty neat little place to visit for an afternoon. The Exploratorium is fun and has things for all ages! 




 I didn't know about the latter point, which would make OPs statement about lack of peer review correct. Plos one has huge problems with consistency and editorial control. 




 Recently did a little road trip to jasper. Coffee from Mcds was as good as Timmy Hos. The only thing the latter has going for them is that it doesn't blatantly look like fast food but it still tastes like industrially processed food. You also have Starbucks cornering them on food too, and local donut and sandwich shops clearing up the high end. 




 Not to mention the non insignificant amount of people sympathizing with fascism in western europe. 




 or how about just boiling it? "man, this coffee is making me really jittery!" 




 It will only boost recruitment if they think they can win. People have survival instincts.

Case in point: long after FARC became anything representative of an agrarian militia and turned to kidnapping and drug smuggling, the Colombian government needed some way to neuter them. The Washington Post had a great article about how they worked with the US government to wiretap every single call coming out of purported FARC locations. Every spot was GPS and intelligence confirmed, which was followed by a American gigantic smart bomb locked for use for only that site. Immediately after were actual Colombian forces which would clean up the area.

After a few years of this FARC in shambles and bankrupt, so they had no choice but to negotiate. The same can be done with ISIS, but it requires years of solid work to strangle them of members and money. 




 Millions? Try tens of billions. The amount of money that pharma pours into drug research would make the NIH go bankrupt. 




 You make an excellent point about ancestral roots. One reasoning as to why the EU has been reluctant to scale up sanctions is because of a lack of cultural history. Most of the member states are Western Europeans who still see the old bloc not as brothers but as cheap labor. Why should they sacrifice gas prices for them? 




 Hilary Clinton made a few hints in her interviews that Obama's worldviews don't translate into what he actually implements. My thought is that he is obsessed with his "legacy" of ending the Afganistan/Iraq wars that he feels paralyzed about doing anything substantial in the Middle East. That said, even his reticence for *political* engagement is really disturbing. 




 I'm surprised this wasn't emphasized more! You could break into a lot of buildings using this trick. 




 How many cancers rely on exogenous arginine? And how hard is it to co-opt another pathway to synthesize it?  




 #3: If the photons have the same momentum in a BEC, then wouldn't it be more of an issue that you can't pack them into an infinitely small space? Or is it that they won't have a singular momentum anymore once you hit the uncertainty limit at that size range?  




 But I guess if the Uspto grants the patent then the only way to get it dismissed is for someone to litigate, right? Are there many organizations out there who will try to get rid of a patent on solely altruistic grounds? My impression is that the Uspto traditionally let companies duke it out in court rather than to be in the business of denying patents.  




 The US patent system is now first to file. Unless I'm mistaken, it probably means that they can apply and possibly get the patent even if other organizations were the first to come up with it. 




 No, they provide a lot of grants and fellowships for researchers. 




 See the other post on this thread. Roughly they do about a third on "non-overhead" expenses, which is actually not that terrible for many charities. People like to focus on the high overhead, but the thing is that as organizations get bigger and your "direct spending" from fundraising goes up, the overhead accordingly balloons. It's unavoidable.

Here's another thought for those who are harping about research. Universities take a huge chunk of money from grants too. They also call it "overhead". It varies by University, but most of them take anywhere from 30-50% of a grant that comes in. For most grant programs, this is listed as either $X in direct costs (meaning excluding overhead and the extra is basically invisible to the application), or is lumped into a total sum (meaning the actual money the researcher sees will be a fraction of it).

Overhead is basically the "cost of admission" for a lot of big organizations. Sure, it seems ridiculous, but I can't think of many nonprofits who do such wide-ranging work and with such huge spending on research and services and have razor thin overheads. 




 How does that work for kidney donors then, if removing one is so invasive? 




 The problem with the American systems was that they were designed to intercept other sophisticated missiles. If you're just intercepting a shitty Palestinian rocket then all you need is something with a very good guidance system and a payload to detonate the rocket in mid-air. A Scud or most other missiles would be totally overkill. 




 Actually, this can also be applied to the Israel/Gaza conflict. Israel feels like they can airstrike them with virtually no impunity, and Hamas feels like that if they only have a 1% chance of sending a missile through then that means they have to send even more missiles. They're expensive to make, so if the Iron Dome didn't work they certainly wouldn't be sending in 15 at a time. 




 How the fuck is this still perpetuated on the internet. Virtually all democracies are republics, meaning you -- the people!! -- elect someone to represent (as in what a republic literally means!!) you in the branches of government! If you were to draw a venn diagram then a republic is a *type of democracy*, not a cousin or an offshoot of it. 




 I've seen waaaay too many primary care physicians who don't put on a pair of gloves, wash their hands, or use the hand sanitizer. 




 I think cats have this type of behavior too. 




 We have one of those too... ours must just be super crappy. 




 I work in a lab, but never used an ultra before. How do you weight out your samples accurately when the fine balance fluctuates ~0.005g even when you close the doors around it? 




 Do you have a reasonable idea of how the general public could have stopped Bush from invading Iraq? I'm genuinely curious, because at that point he had near unanimous support from Congress which is really all that's needed. 




 Military response? That's debatable, but certainly they deserve some kind of international engagement. Nobody bats an eye because except for North Africa most of the continent is poor as shit, and they don't pose a threat to geopolitical interests. The shit that goes down in Africa is utterly disgusting, but it's also morally reprehensible that no developed country takes the time to even become engaged in what happens there. 




 The point is not whether invading was a good idea or not. That was a foregone conclusion. The problem was the follow-through. If Bush had successfully created a vibrant and peaceful Iraqi democracy then Obama wouldn't even have been elected. 




 The Iraqis/Kurds will do that on their own. It's also necessary because it builds a sense of "community" when its your own countryfolk doing the groundwork. 




 When I go to bed I usually start dreaming almost immediately when I close my eyes. Is this normal? I also require a lot of sleep before I feel actually rested -- normally 10-14 hours. 




 Yet another reason to move to MV! Not a big fan of PA after living here for two years. 




 I live in Palo Alto and the closest Pho place is at the border to Mountain View. $10+ for pho. 




 I think it's incredibly expensive to implement a data archival policy if each county is doing it themselves. But what if there was a national cloud system that departments could subscribe to? 




 Wouldn't one be more worried about farm-raised animals versus wild? The population density would be way higher which means diseases and parasites are more endemic. 




 Does that mean the melanocyte-free patches will have a much higher chance of getting skin cancer? 




 A lot of familiar names on the list, and I'm kind of shocked that some of them are under 40! They've been around a while.

 I think it has a lot to do with driver issues. I upgraded my first laptop to Vista back in the day and while the performance was fine a lot of things stopped working because of driver incompatibility (eg. sleep). Nowadays that isn't so much of an issue, although I've had to download a few things from Sony's website when installing Windows 8 to get certain power options to work.

Trackpads are just something to be careful about in the PC world. I remember going to a Best Buy and testing out one of the first ASUS ultrabooks. I couldn't believe how bad it was and how anyone would let that thing out of testing. Good trackpads do exist, but I'm not sure why a lot of PC manufacturers make bad ones. 




 Not sure what you are referring to, but with modern CPU architectures and latest products from vmware/virtualbox/Microsoft the performance penalty is small. 




 ? Virtualbox supports running both Linux and Windows at the same time. You could even hide the Linux desktop and have Linux windows mixed with your Windows ones. Why would you need to reboot? 




 Could you not run the two OSes side-by-side? Plenty of high-power laptops can support that. 




 A mid-high tier Windows PC with the same spec is built just as well as today's Macbooks. 




 I don't understand the people who claim to have issues with Windows laptops. I've owned 3 laptops since 2004 and only one has had any kind of a "catastrophic failure" (my first ASUS Pentium M tank/laptop's hinge broke after owning it for over four years, but the screen still worked perfectly). My second laptop was a Samsung and it had a rattling fan noise by 3.5 years but the only reason I got another laptop was for the compute power. Now I have a VAIO since 2012 and there have been literally zero hardware issues.

In the meantime, I know several people that have bought Macbook Airs in the past six months where either the logic board failed immediately a day after purchase or the machine hard crashes once every few weeks. 




 I thought it would be nice to enter the 21st century by replacing my qwerty Android phone with a new flagship... but all it gave me are typos! 




 I think this is a common trend as you get older. As a guy, I don't understand why women feel the need to cover themselves with makeup and fancy clothes every single day. My girlfriend doesn't wear any and dresses in jeans and a tshirt, and the fact that she's comfortable makes her positively radiant. 




 I currently use click chemistry quite a bit in the lab. It's a really cool technique and I'm glad that Sharpless isn't resting on his laurels. 




 Not sure if I agree with the hairstyle thing. My experience has been that a lot of stylists have a very biased sense of what looks good. Even ones that you'd pay to dollar for, and even between stylists at the same salon.  




 I don't understand how self-reporting is still a valid form of data collection in some psychology and public health labs. "But there's no other way to get the data!" they say. Well, maybe you shouldn't do the experiment if you're just going to get garbage and mislead others. 




 I haven't had cucumbers in my sandwich for years. You've convinced me to get my next one with them! 




 He has said in countless interviews that getting older calmed him down quite a bit. 




 If .23 BAC isn't, then it should be. Driving with that much alcohol in your system is really irresponsible, and is an understatement of the year for someone who is the chief fucking prosecutor. That said, Rick Perry definitely stepped over some legal red lines. 




 My parents have been living in Canada for 25 years. No hesitation or pauses when speaking English, but they have a thick accent. In most multi cultural contexts that's very common and is pretty much functionally fluent.  




 IANAL, but it's probably no. This is why if you are going to contest a charge, your best strategy is to work quickly and escalate as fast as you can before they start hitting you with collection agencies. I suggest sending out a tweet or a public tag on instagram that would embarrass them. 




 The sad part is that there is simply too many people for "low density" farming to feed unless you turned the entire planet into farmland. Intensive industrial farming is just objectively more efficient. Bourlag's Green Revolution saved billions of people simply because farming techniques became modernized. I don't think people really understand that when at the mercy of the weather/climate, entire societies regularly starved to death. Look at North Korea now, and Eastern Europe not even that long ago. 




 Holy shit. 




 That's if you're an amateur. 




 On the flip side, there are bacteria known to accelerate tumorigenesis! H. pylori is one that many people know about for gastric cancer, but there's been a lot of work showing that Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal but an opportunistic pathogen, can invade the colon and accelerate the growth of these tumors. What's really crazy is that this bacteria can literally invade cells and cause disregulation of cancer pathways. There was a paper a few years back where they were able to find genomic sequence belonging to this bacterium in *metastatic* sites. 




 at this point i don't even think they qualify as a rebel group. they should be counted as a quasi-state.  




 Dictatorships by nature suppress dissent and free speech, and the natural urge for agency. Is that good for society? 




 Mega Man? How about Double Dragon 3. What the fuck. 




 why can't lyft do the same in return? this happens all the time in the taxi industry 




 The 1040EZ has pretty short instructions. You literally put in entries for how much you made, how much tax was withheld, do one or two lines of arithmetic, and you're done. Actually, it's such a waste of time that I think the IRS should really be sending *you* a notice about what they think you owe/are owed. A ton of people fall into this super easy category that they could just automate the whole process. 




 I don't blame him -- getting conned makes you lose your trust in the field and can shake you pretty hard. At least he didn't commit suicide like the guy at RIKEN. He probably had a lot of academics throw shit at him as the witch hunt got pretty disgusting at times. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a "fuck this shit, not worth it" moment. 




 Interesting theory -- I particularly agree on how Dany will develop in the books. She is portrayed as such a self-righteous leader that I'm almost certain GRRM has a twist for her at the end. She is blinded by her desire to rule, much like how Stannis and others vie for the Throne. 




 Goddamn... I should move out East! 




 Where do you find plans that are $155 a month for an entire family? Is it radically different by state? Here in CA an individual silver plan on the exchange is ~$200/m BEFORE subsidy. 




 It's too bad they probably won't have battles in space in this game with this one. I loved that part in Ghosts but wished there were jetpacks. 




 ITT a shocking number of people who think they don't smell. Almost every animal on this planet, especially our closest relatives, smell funny. Why would we be the exception? 




 Efficiency is a non issue. Scientists routinely make ips lines with non integrating methods. The hard part now is making cocktails to coax differentiation.  




 This should be repeated in every thread! Most generalizations are generally worthless. However, if someone is actually interested, they will undoubtedly change their behavior around the person they like. The problem with this if you're on the receiving end is you have to get to know the other person first in order to make a call. 




 Once Kurdistan becomes a state (I think at this point it's a matter of when, not if), any US president would be tripping over themselves to have a standing force there or at least a base. They have a good amount of oil and they're not going to let a neighboring shitshow ruin it. 




 The worst is when you are a postdoc though. It's at the age when you're starting to think about marriage, children, mortgages, decent possessions, retirement funds but the pay bump is very minimal. 




 It really depends on your field. In a lot of cases, if you are not going into academia taking six or more years for a PhD will put you behind in terms of on-the-job experience as compared to someone of equivalent age. You could apply to senior scientist positions and you will have a very good background, but you will also be competing with people who know what it's like to be in industry (eg. patents, navigating a team, etc.). 

Some industries absolutely require a PhD for higher level research (eg. biotech and chemistry), but many positions in computer science it might set you back unless you plan on doing research. I would say that if you got a PhD in Physics and went into industry doing quantitative modeling in a completely unrelated field, you would for sure be at a disadvantage compared to others who are applying for the same position. 




 I think that the rest of the world sees the nuance -- the problem is in America. Combat troops in the Middle East has become such a politicized issue, and many people on both sides of the political spectrum immediately take maximalist positions: even one soldier or one bomb is too many. There is a very big opportunity here for the US to help the Kurds. Of course, it will help if the Iraqi citizen saw that they were being rescued by fellow Iraqi/Kurds, but the US can do plenty in terms of providing logistic support and supplies. Honestly, in a conflict of this scale I'm surprised that the US hasn't been supplying the Kurds since Day 1. 




 Ha! What idiots. The more they withhold money from Kurdistan, the faster they will declare independence. Honestly, tomorrow they could declare themselves to be a new country and Iraq could do nothing about it. They could then form a strategic agreement and have a US standing force, because technically it wouldn't be "combat boots in Iraq" anymore. 




 Stainless? Why not glass or Pyrex? I'm sure you can charge a pretty penny too.  




 - When you apply, the understanding is that the university will cover your tuition and stipend. It's very rare that this isn't the case and I've heard of no PhD student in the sciences who have had to pay anything out of pocket (Masters is another matter). In most departments you are expected to TA one or two semesters, but past your first year your PI will pay for you through his own grants. With regards to applying for fellowships, you are applying to graduate school fellowships in your own name. Your PI may also get you to contribute towards his or her grant proposals, which will provide funding for your stipend as well as research money. With regards to the PI funding you: you need to make sure that you are joining a lab with stable funding and that the professor is likely to be tenured if they are junior faculty.

- You should mention the specific professors in mind by name. You won't offend anyone -- in your application letter you need to talk about your research interests and this should naturally lead to some faculty at the department who will be doing something related.

- Letters of recommendation are your bread and butter, because aside from your grades there is nothing else for reviewers to judge. The applications start in the fall until December, so you need to get them lined up. You should be very aggressive in hounding professors. One of my recommenders was the head of a project course that I was part of. As long as they are in an authoritative position at the university and can speak for your laboratory efforts I think that is fair game for graduate school.

- You are definitely at a disadvantage if you are lacking in hard research experience, and your grades and letters will have to make up the difference. If you are feeling unsure I'd suggest working in a lab for a year.

- A side note, with regards to where you should apply: when I was applying for graduate school, my grades were just OK but I had a ton of research experience. I applied to a lot of schools ranging the entire gamut in terms of prestige. In the end I was rejected by virtually all of the schools except for the top tier ones. In my case (as well as for you), it is likely that middle tier schools are operating on training grants that have restrictions on who they can take in (ie. American citizens) as well as labs themselves having less funding. The top tier schools, however, have a lot more money and therefore can take in a much more diverse crowd. Keep that in mind when you are applying. 




 Canadian who got PhD in the states and doing a postdoc in the states too. Knew a lot of people from the UK who went to grad school in the US.

Some major differences:

- The PhD programs are way longer than in the UK. You can be in and out in the UK in 3 years. However, especially in biology this is not enough time to get papers for a good postdc so advantage USA. The problem is that because your stipend and tuition is being funded by your PI, he/she has no real incentive to let you graduate if you are productive. Similarly if a lab is well funded, they might "take a risk" and let you work on a long project that doesn't pan out for eight years or more! In the UK you have a lot of independence but that can range widely with American labs.

- With regards to independence, you are expected to apply for fellowships to support your funding. Many labs don't have this strict requirement, but keep in mind that you'll be spending a lot of time in your first year or two writing fellowship applications. Many of them are only applicable to Americans/Green Card holders, so you should make a list ahead of time and figure out which ones you can apply to. The ones where international people can apply to are EXTREMELY competitive, so make sure you have a polished application and the best letters of reference.

- In your statement of intent for the application, it's generally accepted that you should identify a few labs that you are interested in. However, for many schools (especially in biology PhD programs), you are not taken up immediately by any particular lab on day 1. You will typically do "rotations" around different labs to see where you will be a good fit. However, it's expected that you identify a few interesting PIs in your letter (and explain why! Read their papers!) to show that you've done some research on the school instead of just copy and pasting different applications.

- With regards to LORs, you will need to explain to your recommenders that they will have to write a "you can walk on water" letter for you. It's part of the culture, and if they can't write you one like that then you shouldn't have them writing one and drop them from your application. There is nothing worse than a lukewarm recommendation. Your recommenders should anyway be well-versed in American science to know what's necessary.

- Lab experience: I started my PhD program not too long ago (2006), and at that point it was expected that you go straight from undergrad into a PhD program and there was the expectation that you got your research experience in tandem with your undergrad education. Nowadays I see a lot more people take a year or two off to work in a lab and publish a paper, and it doesn't appear to be hurting their chances (in fact, it only helps if you have a paper). This might be a route that you want to take, especially since it will lead to a good letter of recommendation for graduate school and you will gain a lot of research experience without being thrown into the deep end on Day 1 of graduate school rotations. 




 Wow, kind of shocked at some of the comments in this subthread. Some people really hate the poor for starting families or not getting a proper education. 




 There's such a thing as "nutritional deserts" in poor communities and ghettos where childhood obesity is a bigger problem. For these places, a proper grocery store that sells this type of food is physically out of reach. You either need to drive long distances or take public transit to places that sells affordable healthy food. Also, if you are part of the working poor and are juggling shifts, there is no time to go to a proper grocery store as opposed to the corner store that sells boxed meals. 




 Ugh. And don't get me started with the Hangouts/Talk shitshow. It's like they want to reinvent the wheel every few years. 




 I agree -- unless it's something that can be realistically scaled (eg. a process engineer TODAY can envision how it can be mass produced), most academic work on this kind of thing are just fancy science projects. And this is coming from someone who has a degree in EE. 




 Speaking as a guy, I'd say life in general is pretty good. But there are many issues that, despite being extremely important, are outright ignored or dismissed. Certainly there are a lot of activist groups that advocate for women, but right now it is still seen as a social niche to be an activist for these issues that affect specifically men. 




 How long has the new Maps been out for? It doesn't make any sense for a feature that used to be there to (1) not be in the new version and (2) have Google say "we're working on that same feature". That would imply that they either literally killed the entire old codebase or that it takes them years to port something (like elevation, which presumably exists in a map database that didn't change in between versions!!!). 




 Holy shit, the bus tracker is infuriating. They had it in Gingerbread Maps for a long time and suddenly it's gone. When the new Maps came out they were like "we're working on making it feature complete." Bitch please, the code already exists. You're saying you nuked the entire old codebase? 




 Not to mention that for some reason, many restaurants and shops don't show up on search for browsing *when you're zoomed in on the location*. In the old interface you would have everything come up with a pin and a sidebar to scroll through. Not with the new Maps interface. 




 Europe got rebuilt quickly because of major assistance from the US. It's going to take way longer if not forever for Syria.  




 When i was in graduate school i had a lot of friends in middle eastern studies who traveled around Syria in the summer just a few years before the civil war. It's really sad to think about how the country has turned into a failed state so quickly and because nobody in the world really cares it's going to stay that way for a long time.  




 It's not bottomless. 




 Agreed! A local guitar shop has maybe a handful of guitars. Some of them carry really expensive vintage gear as "big ticket" items, but the rest of the entry-mid level stuff is pretty bad. Not to mention not a single local shop that I've been to has a proper soundproof room to test out an instrument in peace.

Also coffee shops: I live in the Bay Area, and there is no shortage of really shitty "local" coffee shops that claim to have great drinks and charge $3-4 for fucking drip/pourover. 




 The NCAA is basically the minor league for a lot of sports, so why shouldn't the players be compensated? Many of them are given scholarships that let them just barely get by, or are treated like de facto professional athletes with none of the benefits. Many of them never "go pro", and have to deal with injuries for the rest of their lives with no compensation or help from their alma mater. 




 I don't know if that's a fair argument though. One of the really attractive things about solar and wind are that despite its low output, you don't really have to do much once it's up. You basically get the energy "for free" from the sun. Nuclear energy still requires mining, enrichment, and building the plants themselves (I'm pro-nuclear, though). There were a lot of studies done that said although nuclear energy has a huge output, the sheer dollar amount of safety infrastructure, regulations, and bureaucracy makes it not that much more efficient.

You also have interesting advantages with solar/wind, such as decentralization of the power grid and the ability to deploy in remote/rural areas. You can easily deliver power to BFE without building extensive power lines, which is really attractive for interior USA.
 




 The weird thing about Facebook is that they have the image of being the creepy and evil company, which results in a huge base that hates them. Google on the other hand probably engages in creepy and evil activity that is much worse but is viewed much more favorably. 




 The fact that your credit history, which is made up of a ton of things, can be aggregated into a number is mind-boggling. 




 Live in PA too -- I probably see one or two Teslas on a daily basis. The Leafs are everywhere though. 




 What makes me upset is that he is so openly hypocritical, and then lies to your face. it's an extremely cynical down of governing. Even with bush we knew what he was up to upfront and voted accordingly. Obama just seems like a slimy guy after the election was over.  




 It's a matter of survival! I'm surprised so few people get this point. Israel has *literally* walled off the entire Gaza strip, preventing anyone from freely coming in or out. Aid is at a pathetic level. Infrastructure is nonexistent. The only organization that will give any semblance of food or medicine is a terrorist organization. They will kill you if you support the "other side". What else are you supposed to do? Palestinians living in Gaza literally have nothing.

A parallel case (but not quite as close in terms of severity) would be Hezbollah in Lebanon. In many cases they were the only local force providing infrastructure, security, food, medicine, etc. I have friends who described it as "they were the only ones there." It's too bad they also caused mayhem. 




 just because it's made at a restaurant didn't mean it's better. most bars and pubs have to source from suppliers like sysco if they want the prices to be that cheap, even accounting for profits from drinks. 




 just like freakonomics. for some reason people easy that stuff up.
