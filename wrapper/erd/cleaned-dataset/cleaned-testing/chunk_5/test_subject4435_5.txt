 I actually might give this a shot. Sleep doesn't come easy here. 




 This isn't how nosleep works. The rules are in the sidebar.  




 Y'all okay? 




 This is why I have a dog. She barks at everything and sure sometimes that gets annoying but I'm secure knowing nothing will ever get to me without her letting me know first. 




 Hey R4R! I'm short and often grouchy and easily creeped out, and I need friends! Maybe more than friends? But mostly just friends. Anyone local? Male or female. I like working on cars, beer, bacon, boobs, baking, books, nail polish, knitting, and my dog.  




 "Chortle" made me chortle. 




 Update soon! 




 Spill the beans OP! We can probably help you but only if we have the full story. 




 Your mom may just be sticking around to keep an eye on you and the house. How long until you turn 18? I'd move in there ASAP if I were you. Just keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary that feels threatening. 




 I really enjoy your writing. If you have more experiences, you should post them. How is your wife doing now? 




 No one ever looks for those girls. 
Queen street, Toronto? 




 Holy crap. This must be terrifying for you. 




 Best comment ever.  




 And um... "suicided?" I picture this being written in crayon by that mean kid who picks on everyone else, and his older brother let him on nosleep to scare the shit out of him. 




 It's the ring.  




 In the fall I had a feeling my ex's (who I'm still VERY weirdly close with) girlfriend was pregnant. Sure enough he told me she was. I looked at my mum that day and said "He's not gonna be a dad." I had no idea what I meant at the time but I had this feeling that something bad was going to happen. About 6 weeks later he told me she had had a miscarriage. 

Also ever since I had surgery in December I seem to be seeing things in corners and blurry places here and there and the odd shadow with no cause. Something about being put under I think. 




 Anyone else read this, hoping for the mold? 




 Same here actually. My grandad's family used to just KNOW stuff and in the last few months I've found myself KNOWING things I have no possible way of knowing. We're also prone to seeing people in places they aren't. I basically got a dog for the express purpose of letting me know when the people I see are real. 




 Happy birthday! :) You are brave and brilliant and loved. 




 Seconded. Also the reason I don't put my dog outside unsupervised. 




 I expect I'll have a baby on Friday the 13th. Hopefully the Calusari aren't hanging around. No patience for grouchy old Romanian men. 




 I'm working really hard on convincing myself they're not. I was waiting outside the recovery room for a friend after major surgery this week and kept seeing people/whatever in the hallway out of the corner of my right eye. There was no one there. It was bad. At home I'm mostly just seeing blurry spots/shadows and my cats are wild all the time. My therapy dog can't be bothered with it though I've noticed she sleeps a lot closer to me at night now. 




 Holy. Shit. Coat hanger.  




 How to freak out someone who had surgery a while ago and since sees blurry things in corners: THIS. Keep us updated OP. 




 CALL THE COPS! No one ever thinks to call the cops. 




 Thank you, captain obvious. Also, fork off.  




 Boy that was helpful. 




 This was incredible. Props OP. I don' think I blinked the whole time I was reading. 




 Business idea: open Etsy shop selling different shapes/sizes/styles of tinfoil hats. Split profits? 




 Have you ever learned more about your parents? Tell us more! 




 Death, bro. Death. 




 MORE!!! 




 Commenting before reading because was 100% listening to Jar of Hearts while scrolling /nosleep new stories. Creepy. 




 Your girlfriend's name isn't Steph is it? 




 I find passing out is almost involuntary for me after a big adrenaline rush, if that explains the sleeping at all. 




 I might never sleep again... 




 Take the cat. 




 I think they were asking if the safe contents were pictures of mob-guy's hits. I can't be positive though obviously. 




 Fantastic! So long as he's healthy, protein is protein. 




 Be careful not to overfeed poor Baxter. Too much meat can upset his stomach. ;) 




 I second the bruise thing. I have one on the top of my foot and one on the  side of my forearm and NO idea where they came from. I blame them all on the guy I hang out with but I don't think they've ever actually been his fault, they just appear. 




 Any news? How is he doing? 




 Are you in Nova Scotia? You described yourself and one of your friends EXACTLY like my best friend and his girlfriend. Her name is even Rachel and she's a ginger. 




 Mine too! 




 Hey OP. I'm a nanny and I've had a lot of strange experiences. One thing I've learned is if you want people to believe you, you need to take videos or pictures and hand them over to someone who can be objective. You could consider wall mounted baby monitors or a camcorder on a tripod, or even a cell phone video. You could also try a line of salt or brick dust at your doorway to see if she can cross it, and I would get in touch with the priest as soon as you can. Something else to consider, for someone who may be a bit more open minded, you could try contacting your local paranormal society. It seems most places have them and they can usually be contacted via facebook or a local shop. Good luck and keep us updated.  




 I swear when I was in emerg for my gall bladder, I was a little high on pain meds and saw a bubble and FREAKED OUT til the nurse explained it to me. It's a pretty widely held belief! 




 I may be. Or I may not. It all depends on your response. 




 It's... The Strangest Load I Ever Pulled. I think? Or something like that. It just sounds wrong to me.
