 The adult face on the kid is throwing me off 




 I'm more interested in the political and scientific landscape now with the Reapers gone. That why in my continued edit1, the plot starts going into Metal Gear/political intrigue territory. 




 Shep never had a kid. The person you play in ME5 is the offspring of your ME4 character (who is unrelated to Shep).

ME5 they will be about 18 years old, while ME6 they'll be in their 20s. 




 I am a Line in the Cult of Kirrahe 




 The Prophet does not care for the Batarians. The appearance they have as Batarian sympathizers is just a cover. In secret, he wishes to cause strife by hiding within Batarian territory and attacking human and Citadel trade hubs, putting pressure on the Alliance to go to war with the Batarians for "harboring" a terrorist group.

In truth, the Prophet wishes a war to happen between humanity and the weak Batarians. He sees a void of power amongst the Batarians and believes he can manipulate himself to their leadership using political intrigue and immense biotic power. He is confident his adopted son will hold the throne and eventually, make the biotic humans into a new god-like apex race, with the Batarians as their slaves
 All other races will serve or die under this new galactic order.

His long term goal is universal conquest through biotics and spacetime manipulation - he literally believes his son will be immortal as no other biotic has displayed the son's amount of power.

Of course the Prophet dies in ME4. ME5 and 6 take place decades after and follow this adopted son as he grows up and befriends your player character (who is the unexpected offspring from your ME4 love interest). The Sons are dismantled in ME4, but this adopted son becomes an extremely powerful biotic who (by the end of ME6) has the very power to move suns and create black holes
 Albeit he is unstable by the end, the two games would focus more ln the consequences of your actions in ME1-4; as offspring of your PC in ME4, how do you deal with relationships? Will you be nice or antagonistix? Join a gang with your biotic friend, or join C-Sec? It will be about choice, growing up and finding oneself. 




 Hi all, I've been replaying Mass Effect again and have thought of an idea for the next ME4-6. Let me know what you think! I had the following ideas while doing my latest playthrough.

I just finished watching Place Beyond the Pines this past week too and thought "how come we never see the consequences years down the line of our choices?" Every RPG ends when the Big Bad Guy dies. The world is saved and that's it. Dragon Age tackled it a bit in DA2 and DAI, but it feels impersonal. You never see what happens to your character, his/her friends or family. ME2 tried it a bit as well, but apart from a few "Oh, Liara is on Illium now," it is not that fleshed out. What would happen if your character conceived with a love interest? Why do we take certain things for granted in a game like ME, like "where does this crazy biotic stuff come from?" I wanted to explore themes of religion, consequence, family  hope. So I hope you will enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. I did get tired mid-writing, but I plan to write more.

**Mass Effect 4**

We pick up about 15 years after Mass Effect 3. If you chose Control, the Reapers have finished rebuilding the Relays and have secluded themselves. Otherwise, the Relays were rebuilt anyways. You can pick your own race this time around. 

Your brother (or sister, if Asari), is a C-Sec officer on the Citadel. You get word they were killed in a large biotic suicide blast that has caused severe damage to the Presidium. Your sibling was scared, and believed there was an insider working for said terrorist organization inside C-Sec, so they turned to the only person they could trust - you. 

You are brought into the Citadel and take part in the investigation, having the only viable intel from your sibling. Your first squadmate is a Drell C-Sec offer named Roven (literally making names up on the spot), and close friend to your sibling. The bombing investigation leads you to a shipping manifest for materials used to make the same biotic-fueled explosive device. The manifest comes from Omega.

Roven used to work for Aria, and believes she may know who ordered the parts. 

Before you leave the Citadel, an aging, wealthy businessman (with a dark past) named Dondarion wishes to join you to avenge the death of his two daughters and wife killed in the explosion. 

Additionally, a Roven recommends tracking down Gaven, a Salarian explosives expert who may be able to help. After fighting through baddies who have taken Gaven prisoner for betraying a criminal organization, he agrees to join the team.

The Council gives you a small, cramped and rustic frigate called the Argonaut (a drastic change from the luxurious Normandy), for your trip. You now have a mission - track what group bombed the Citadel and killed your bro/sister.

If Shep helped Aria take back Omega, you arrive to find it undergoing reconstruction and renovation. Otherwise, it's a bit more worse for wear (like in ME2), but Aria still managed to retake the station on her own after Cerberus collapsed. Aria tells you the materials likely came from a renowned bomb-maker, a Blue Suns Batarian named Yosup. You fight through waves of Blue Suns merc before finally arriving at Yosup's compound. You defeat Yosup in a boss battle. You then ask him who ordered the bomb and then can choose to kill him or turn him to Aria. No matter which option you take, a human woman arrives and frantically tells you another bomb will go off on Omega. As she speaks, a violent explosion detonates in the heart of the city. Your party manages to survive as the woman shields you in a biotic bubble. 

The woman's name is Kolinya - she is a former member of a mysterious cult called the "Sons of Shepard." She had escaped and was looking for you. Back aboard the Argonaut, Kolinya explains the Sons of Shepard are almost certainly the group behind the attack. On the outside, they are a human extremist group of Batarian sympathizers. The founder is simply referred to as "The Prophet," is a powerful biotic human who left the Systems Alliance following the Reaper War. The Prophet left the Systems Alliance territory in search of meaning and stumbled across the Batarian religion, Vhar'shan, which preaches of strength and unity from [ancient Batarian scrolls.](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Kite%27s_Nest:_Pillars_of_Strength) The Prophet began intense study and came to his own conclusions that the Reapers were an apex race, but with them out of the picture, a void became apparent.

Kolinya explains the Prophet broke off from the main Batarian sect of Vhar'shan and started his own "Sons of Shepard." The Prophet believes that the post-Reaper apex race must be biotic humans. The end goal of the Prophet's beliefs, is biotic humans can eventually control the forces of the universe and ascend to godhood. The Prophet believes Shepard ascended to godhood on the Crucible and is the first of this new apex race. The Prophet, a powerful biotic, believes he will be the second to ascend. The Sons believe that the invisible forces of the universe chose Shepard, a human, to be the first of a new godhood which will rule creation. The Sons believe that mastering these forces through biotics, will allow them to join Shepard and rule all creation. They believe biotic powers have the ability to change the very laws of nature, therefore granting them the powers of gods. The Prophet concluded that the Reapers, despite their raw power, were unmatched to that of creation itself. What is a Reaper's laser beam to a supernovae, or black hole?

Kolinya shows the party a brief glimpse of the Prophet's preaching, in which the group recites their code: "We are children of the cosmos, the apex of creation. The Earth is our mother. The stars are our family. Our thoughts belong to the cosmos and with these hands we shall shape its destiny. Glory be unto the Shepard. Amen."

**Edit/continued 1:** With Kolinya's revelation, it becomes clear who the antagonist in the game is at this point. Your party must stop the Prophet before he begins a full-scale war between Batarians and humanity.

While on Omega, you discover Aria T'Lok was killed in the blast that has left half the station completely destroyed. You gain the help of a female Quarian bounty hunter named Jeema, who seeks the bounty on whoever killed Aria. 

The game continues in this fashion for some time, your party consisting of:

Roven - male Drell C-Sec officer. Similar to Garrus, he is a romantic interest for female PC.

Kolinya - female human biotic. A cross between a Liara and Cassandra (Dragon Age) personality. She is a romantic interest for male PC.

Dondarian - male human business magnate, on a quest for vengeance. He is a former smuggler and knows Zaeed Massani quite well. Possible fling with female or male PC, but no long-term romance.

Jeema - female Quarian bounty hunter. A cross between Boba Fett and that badass Tali. She is a romantic interest for male or female PC.

Gaven - Salarian explosives expert with eccentric personality. A bit of Mordin, Han Solo and Jack Sparrow rolled into one crazy package. He is not a romantic interest.

Over the course of the game, you discover there is an upcoming conference between Systems Alliance and Batarian Parliament leadership. The Prophet plans to bomb the proceedings and blame it on human extremists, hoping to instigate a war.

Your party arrives in team to stop the Sons of Shepard from blowing up the conference. As the members of government are thanking you, another bomb detonates and kills many. You discover the bomber, a rogue Spectre named Faraday, and he is not part of the Sons of Shepard, but is a member of the secretive Systems Alliance organization called SAICOM (Systems Alliance Intelligence Command).

Faraday says bombing the conference was necessary and will be blamed on the Sons of Shepard - his superiors believe a war with the Batarians is inevitable. Humanity needs a war with the Batarians in order to restart their economy following the post-Reaper recession. Faraday explains the Batarians inhabit many resource-rich worlds, but as the Batarians lack the technology or expertise to extract much of said resources.

The overall plan was to have the Player stop the Sons of Shepard from bombing the conference, as SAICOM knew they would succeed. Faraday therefore planted a *secondary* bomb that SAICOM *blamed* on the Batarians, in order for the Citadel races to be sympathetic towards humanity.

The Prophet was a former SAICOM employee who headed a project called BioHuI, or the Biotic-Human Inquiry Project. Faraday says the Prophet was originally going to be a human martyr - the public would rally behind a kind, caring biotics teacher if they discovered a Batarian was behind the attack. But the Prophet converted to the Batarian religion and was shortly fired from SAICOM, where he vowed vengeance and took off into Batarian space. 

The player then can decide what to do with Faraday; expose the truth, which would most certainly make humanity into the galaxy's black sheep. Or the player can hide the truth, thereby avoiding potential war and accept Faraday into their crew (as SAICOM believes Faraday died in the blast). An alternative is to still hide the truth, but murder Faraday. If you accept Faraday into your crew, he agrees to change his name and live under the radar.

**Continue Edit2:**

The player is now on the run from SAICOM agents, as well as tasked by the Citadel to track down the Sons of Shepard and eliminate their enigmatic Prophet. Faraday manages to locate the Sons headquarters - a large spherical station orbiting a Batarian red supergiant star. But the Argonaut is no Normandy - approaching the base directly would be suicide. Faraday proposes that the Player, Faraday and one other crew member pose as new converts to the Sons and infiltrate through a new recruit meeting, where you will see the Prophet himself.

The Player, Faraday and Crew Member get into the Son's headquarters and are shuffled into the main room. The Prophet emerges as a talking head on a TV monitor. The Prophet points out to the crowd of the Player's treachery and a fight breaks out. You battle your way through the Sons of Shepard base. The Player comments that many of the murals and depictions on the walls depict something resembling the Christian trinity - a "father," in the form of Shepard, a "Spirit", in the form of The Prophet, and a "son," in the form of an unknown young man.

You reach the end of the station to discover the Prophet had actually died many years ago, after the Reaper War. The Prophet now is a self-aware Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to control the universe through biotics. In its possession is an infant child, presumably the "son" depicted in the murals.

The Prophet AI, knowing full well it will be terminated, explains its origins to the Player if you have a high enough charisma/renegade/whatever.

Prophet was originally a man named Paul Sutton, a powerful biotic employed to combat the Reaper threat. Sutton worked for SAICOM, and was promoted to head of the BioHuI Project with the task of unlocking biotic abilities in children (very much like Jack and Cerberus), in order to combat the Reapers. When the Crucible emerged and SAICOM no longer needed BioHuI in its current form. SAICOM modified the Project's goals - unlock human biotics to help secure human dominance in a post-Reaper political environment. SAICOM believed humanity has a great chance of advancing itself to the forefront of politics, and biotics could help with war reparations.

Sutton became disillusioned with SAICOM, saying that BioHuI Project was just a cover for SAICOM's human extremism. "They are no worse than Cerberus, no more dangerous than the Illusive Man. Just now they have no Reapers to stop them and everything to gain," the PROPHET AI explained.

SAICOM fired Sutton, but that was not enough. Sutton threatened to expose SAICOM's extreme nature, so they attempted to assassinate him through a toxin. In a desperate attempt, Sutton fled and found refuge with the Quarians and Geth. But it was too late - Sutton knew he would succumb to his poisoning and, seeking revenge against SAICOM, pleaded with the Geth to upload his mind onto a machine intelligence. The PROPHET AI was born, with the goal to destroy SAICOM.

PROPHET rapidly learned more of biotics through its vastly expanded neural AI network with the Geth. PROPHET discovered the potential of biotic abilities - they have the potential to change the structure of the universe itself. PROPHET realized that the universe itself would end, even after trillions upon trillions of years. **PROPHET explained it's end goal was to stop death all together - both for organic species and the universe itself.**

"I would establish a new covenant in this creation - a perfect symbiosis between creation and life. With everything under my perfect command there would be no death, no gnashing of teeth or endings. Our universe would be eternal and perfect."

The PROPHET manipulated (or indoctrinated...) the first Sons, using Shepard as a religious icon to gather together the meek and desperate. PROPHET then bred himself a biotic son - a vessel unto which PROPHET could control the physical realm, while PROPHET controlled the digital.

The Player is disgusted by said revelations and had to option to destroy PROPHET through a virus provided by Faraday, or convince the AI to kill itself. Regardless, PROPHET becomes no more. The Player discovers the son, crying in a nearby crib. The Player can decide what to do with the child - kill it (in which case ME4 is effectively the end of the trilogy), hand it over to Jack's academy, or adopt it in secret.

Mass Effect 4 ends with the destruction of the Sons of Shepard base and the end of the terrorist organization. You are thanked by the Citadel. Finally, you are given the choice to oust SAICOM yourself, or let Faraday do it. Regardless of this choice, the Systems Alliance becomes embroiled in political scandal and war with the Batarians still looms as a possibility.

Thus ends Mass Effect 4. 

Coming up next in oodbot's trilogy, we'll explore the consequences of your actions. 18 years after ME4, your son or daughter, whom you had with your love interest (or off-screen lover, if none chosen), will be the Player in Mass Effect 5. What happens to the biotic, tank-bred boy? Will there be war with the Batarians? What happened to SAICOM? Was PROPHET correct - can one really control mass effect itself? ...and more in **Mass Effect 5: Generations.** 




 wow, thanks! 




 The only mods he should use are the texture packs 




 I love gaming so much i dropped out of uni last year and I start game dev college next week!! 




 I always go for Liara first - best squadmate for her biotic abilities. 




 Commander Shepard, assuming he/she has survived the Star Child encounter, is now living life as a recluse with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He/She (let's just use "He" to save time) has gone off to live on his own. He has not seen his last love interest in years, nor ever fathered a child with said love interest. Shep has developed a drinking problem and (if male) has a gnarly beard because he doesn't give a shit anymore. He lives alone, reminiscing on the glory days; watching old vids, writing down his thoughts and replaying the events in his mind over and over (much like this very subreddit...).

Despite the destruction (which is the only ME3 end that allows Shep to live) of the Reapers, they still haunt his dreams every night. He remembers the death of all the people under his command; despite the trillions of people Shepard saved, he still feels immense sadness over the loss of loved ones (Miranda, Thane, those in the suicide mission, etc.).

In Mass Effect 4, set several decades after ME3, our player character is facing a new threat. He/She travels to Shepard's home - in a remote part of the galaxy - for assistance. Shepard offers some advice, but is too old and depressed to get off his/her ass to help. Shep, whos now this reclusive drunk, tells the player to give up. No matter how far they go to save the world, the world will slowly forget them and all their friends will die. All the killing and death will haunt them, so they should give up and go live a normal life and raise a family. Shep regrets being the saviour, as he feels isolated and elevated to this psuedo-demigod status where he is completely alienatesd from your average person. Most of his old squadmates have died of age, or gone off to do their own thing. He awakes every night, screaming of reapers and collectors, then cries himself back to sleep while trying to forget the next day with another bottle of scotch. Shep tells the player to forget him - he's a useless relic. He's just a man (or woman), not some invincible hero the universe has made him. 

Later, a main mission requires you to head to Eden Prime. Shepard volunteers to help - he wants to come, to finish off old demons. For one final mission, you play with the aging Shepard, as he battles valiantly through Eden Prime for whatever the particular objective is. You reach the spot where he first encountered the beacon in ME1 - where the entire series began. Your team is ambushed there. Shepard offers to stay behind, giving you time to escape. You eventually agree and escape to your ship with your two squadmates. Shepard stays where it all began and fights to the death. As he dies, he looks to see the escaping ME4 squadmates, but they've taken the form of his old crew. He smiles, then dies - peace at last 

If shep died in your ME3 playthrough...you get Garrus or some shit instead.

 




 You big stupid jellyfish 




 But why are they doing kickstarters? Did their other games not make enough money or something?

I smell bad business practices - you can't keep going from crowd-fund to crowd-fund. Learn to make a good game and set it at a profitable price point. 




 Are they doing another Kickstarter? Isn't Shadowrun Returns already a released product on Steam? 




 Because I believe in and follow Jesus Christ, I must be a science rejecting retard.

Thanks for the daily reminder, Reddit! 




 Quit being so fucking melodramatic. They're computer games. Grow up 




 Thank you Batman's Joker. 




 I think the red line indicates a type-1 civilization, or a planetary civilization that controls all the energy output of one planet. We're on the cusp of achieving this, through bio and geo-engineering. But if we don't stop our rapid over-consumption and disregard for the environment, and learn to work together, we may not make it past that red line. 




 For me it was: spend $400 on a 970 no one gives a shit. Spend another $400 on the same GPU for SLI...they perk an eyebrow then don't give a shit after 5 seconds.

You guys seriously are over-thinking all of this shit. No one fucking cares about your weekend or gaming habits. They really don't - they forget in 10 seconds unless you live with some overprotective mother (in which case, you're a teenager so who fucking cares) 




 Oh they will. OP is just a teenager who has never actually done a 5AM bar hop, and most people in this thread are also whiny little twats 




 IIT: 16 year olds who are making this into some sort of "deal." 

My bro watches 10 hours of football on Sunday. I game for 10 hours on Sunday. We both get equally chewed out by our parents for being lazy fucks, even now when we don't live with them

You guys sound so fucking whiny. 




 I got a huge panic attack when I went to Sagittarius A* the first time. I tend to stay near our home system too - I went to the edge of the universe once and completely NOPED out of there. 




 But if you met an alien you wouldnt know of they had a soul. How could you tell an alien "animal" apart from a "smart" alien? Our idea of intelligence is completly unique to our own human experience. To say whether an alien has intelligence or not is absurd at best, idiotic at worst.

What if they are a form of life beyond your human experience can comprehend? Some sort of multi-dimensional being, or a creature that communicates through a special kind of radiation? What if the very planet or stars were intelligent beings? It doesnt matter - they are beyond our capacity to understand and therefore, irrelevant to our salvation. Let God worry about the other entities out there. 




 According to the fermi paradox, an intelligent species should have evolved long ago and would have colonized much of the known universe (including earth) by now. 




 OP have you read any Stanislaw Lem? He deals with aliens in a more realistic and alien way than most sci-fi. I think your OP assumes aliens would be your typical Star Trekky or Star Warsish "humanoid" aliens, like the Klingon or Asari from Mass Effect.

Stanislaw Lem's novels treat aliens as entirely different entities - creatures so strange, so beyond our comprehenson, we cannot begin to understand, let alone empathize with them. In Lem's Solaris, the human crew finds out the alien they are studying is a planet-wide "ocean-organic," where each wave of this planetary ocean is actually a muscle contraction ( or so they hypothesize). The organism begins reading their minds and projecting their past, dead, loved ones into the world as ghostly abstractions. The crew starts going insane, but never in the book do they realize why the organism is doing this - is it communicating with them? Is this its way of speaking? Does it have goals or objectives, like a human would? What are those abstract shapes it creates with each [wave?](
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Symmetriad_3.jpg/250px-Symmetriad_3.jpg)

Lem leaves these things open ended in his novels. He is easily the master at creating truly exotic/alien life.

My point is that i don't believe the great commission extends beyond our own species. We don't preach to apes or dolphins, yet they show signs of intelligence. The organisms in Lem's novels are many millions or billions of years older than man, sgowing intelligence too, yet how can you begin to proselytize to such alien life? The core of Jesus' teaching is on love and empathy - how could I have empathy for the billion-year old, planet-encompassing nanobot alien in Lem's "The Invincible"? 




 That part took me 2 hours and killed the entire momentum of the Circle Tower quest 




 Cannot upvote this enough. Enough with the le Gaben shit - GabeN doesnt know how to do good fucking customer service. 




 Hold onto the credits and use it to buy the future modules. 




 Not enough to do SLI, but thanks for offer 




 Well they're not free, unless you got an Omega from buying a 290 GPU 




 You didn't add the 315p to 325a upgrade path for $5 




 Everything these days is too damned expensive. Look at this Bible I bought: fifteen bucks. And talk about a preachy book; everyone's a sinner. Except for this guy. 




 But they were more subtle than this.

 One more thing - how many SATA ports are there? I have a HDD, CD drive and 2 SSDs 




 Ok - so how much for it with shipping to Ontario? 




 And it comes with all screws, risers, cables, like it would be in a closed box? 




 Oh, you haven't tested it? 




 On NewEgg's site there's loads of bad reviews - are these justified? http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131833

Still looking for good 970 deals.  




 Done. PMing. 




 PMd for GPU. New Years Resolution is 2560x1440. 




 Want to latch onto OP - I too, need a 1155 MOBO, same CPU as OP. 




  I got fired, not for my lack of computer skills and repair quality, but for not selling enough. 

That sounds very odd. Our in-store technicians do shit sales, because they're in the shop all their shift, but management knows that so these guys have very low firing rate (the current main guy is 25, has been working there since he was 18). 




 I work at Staples Canada as a Tech Salesman, so Staples Business Depot (US) may be entirely different. I don't do much of the easycare (tech support) side of things, but I built my own gaming computer so I am pretty confident in my tech abilities.

But for what it's worth, Staples has given me the best job training of all my jobs thus far. I have worked as a telecom engineer, government data  inputter (wow that was exciting job), fast food, grocery stores...

Staples gives you excellent sales training, through role-plays, videos, product knowledge quizzing, etc.

I just posted my stories cause it's fun to blow off steam.

There is a Best Buy right near my store and I know a few of the guys there. They always say our customer service and training is 100x better than theirs and they would rather work here after finding out how shitty Best Buy really is behind the scenes 




  When I was in retail I actually preferred this kind of stuff. It was busy work that would help pass the time and made it easier to avoid interacting with people.

Yuppp. My thing is getting printers down from overstock. Get to rid the picker for an hour or two. 




 Staples Employee here, also work in tech. Similar stories to OP with a couple I'll add.

 Many customers think RAM is the be-all-end-all of computer hardware. The more RAM you have, the faster your computer/laptop will be, period. Some look stunned when I tell them they're 12-year-old daughter doesn't need more than 4GB of RAM (standard in any laptop now) for her school work.

 Customers paying for $2000 Macbook Pro's in cash, when you can tell they're living off government subsidy.

 Customer couldn't understand why his onboard laptop GPU wouldn't support a 1440p monitor when a) it simply did not support WQHD (I googled it), and b) he didn't even have the right port on his laptop. He was there in our store for 3 hours trying to make the fucking monitor work.

 Got yelled at by a guy who claims we sold him faulty monitor cable. Turns out he thought his DVI cable would work as an HDMI cable, as his monitor did not support DVI.

 No, we don't have that Boxing/Black Friday Doorcrasher in stock. Stop fucking whining. Get here at 7AM like everyone else.

I like to complain, but I will be honest that our store doesn't get that many idiots compared to the rest of the retail employee's I've met. 




 Only thing I'd change is get an SSD if you could afford one, otherwise looks great. Nice case 




  run triple 1440p monitors, hopefully 2 of the 27in korean ones, and one of the 34in widescreens from LG. 

Jesus.

Good luck.

 It's going to crush most modern games. 




 Yeah, we gotta try and get EasyCare Plans (ECP), applecare, laptop/tablet setups, etc.

The warranties are easy to sell on printers cause people break the damn things so often. 




 Staples worker here. Get the same kind of questions.

Today was good though - I converted a young (10 y.o.) padawan into a mechanical keyboard convert. 




 if you find a cheap one lemme know, bought another 970 myself. already own a 970 ftw. 














 egads, if only my mobo could do sli.... 




  BUY them at a store in Skyhold.

Please tell me how. I am overloaded with useless currency.

 if you do everything there is to do. 

Like collect 10 hides or return a runaway Druffalo? These are literally quests I'm encountering 20+ hours into the game.

The only activity I semi-enjoy doing is closing Rifts, since it's easy, combat-focused and rewards good Power Levels.

Let's take a look in my journal right now actually...

Kill 2 guys for Cassandra in each zone.

Kill Venatori agents for Dorian in different zones.

Visit a grave in Hinterlands for some asshole in Redcliffe Village.

Kill wolves near a farm.

Close 0/2 or 3 rifts (x2-3 for each zone).

Is this WoW or a BioWare game? I don't recall doing this mindless shit in Origins or Mass Effect. I know Mass Effect had some grindy, shitty MMO quests, but you could skip them and do the main quest right away without grinding power level. 




 No, the game requires you to get a certain "Power Level"^over^nine^thousand in order to access the next main quest. It's padded as hell with fetch quests and repetitive ~~Oblivion gates~~ [Rifts.](http://www.riftgame.com/wp-content/themes/riftgame_2013/library/images/RIFT-og.jpg)

In order to do some of the companion quests (e.g. Kill Dorian's Venatori agents), you are required to return to the gimmicky, cow-clicky War Table in order to open up more areas of the map. Fuck off BioWare, let me explore at my leisure. If an area is too hard for me, idgaf, let me die. 




 I'm on the second last main quest with 40 hours in. Don't tell me I haven't really started it.

Fucking idiots downvote me all you want; defend your overrated generic Tolkien clone that shits on Origins. 




 Because his writing while he goes "insane" is so fucking terrible. It's fanfic bad. 




 You may enjoy Pixel Piracy 




 Might want to avoid Inquisition after your first paragraph 




 I think a cool idea would be a Oregon Trail-style game where you play Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt. 




 Until the cringe-worthy final conversation 




 I never even beat Inquisition. Between the boring combat, fetch quests, empty open world, and shitty main plot, no desire to finish the game. Game of the Year, my ass. Aliens Isolation should have won.

 I just went back and have started another Mass Effect playthrough under "the man with no name...Zapp Shepard at your service." He womanizes and never prepares for anything. Looking forward to ME2.

Edit; thanks for the downvotes, ^fucking^idiots

I have 40 hours in Inquisition, more than my Origins or DA2 playthroughs. I am on the second last quest with no intention any time soon of finishing.

 Thanks for the link - the numpad is required though, since I do a lot of maths and excel stuff. I'll look around that site 




 I'd give gold if I could, well done 




 Hey we got the same ship :D I upgraded my Omega to an Avenger  




 Unless you have a peasantbox to sell, wait for the new cards coming out next year 




 I would like the Metal Gear Revengeance game

http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxilium/

Merry Boxing Day!! 




 No bring everything with you 




 I work at Staples and we have it for $30 too right now. Return the one you bought and re-buy it to get $10 back. 




 I had the 670 and upgraded to a 970 FTW for my new 1440p monitor. Its awesome, and only $420 canadian, whereas my 670 was $370

The alternative is SLI 2 670s which would be very powerful and arguably better than a single 970 for most sli-supported games 




 Those are both DVI ports. 




 Yes 




 Look at getting a 270x or 750ti 




 Does it have 2xDVI? 




 Get a third monitor or return it for something cheaper. 2 monitor gaming doesnt work as you would have the screen split in half 




 Best bang for buck is 970 - third best card on the market and only $350. 




 2xHDMI or 2xDVI 




 Unless you go big with the CPU (like some monstrous i7 or xeon) you won't see much difference. Save some money for a better GPU like a 970 




 What is your budget? 




 Get  280X for another $30-40 with the cash you save on the OS 




 You don't need that monster of a CPU. I have a i5-3570k overclocked and it was half price, along with my 970 I get 45-60fps max in Crysis or Dragon Age at 1440p. 




 Did you put them in the same color ports?  




 Bought my bro a chromecast. Mom loved it so much I got another for her iphone 




 F 




 I always buy the parts myself and my Dad says "Okay I will give you the monry back, happy birthday/christmas." 




 Is there a noticable difference between 1600 and 1866 MHz? 




 And I try to sell people my company's (Staples) full Windows clean and setup that is only 150, rather than spending $400+ on a new laptop they likely won't see a huge difference with if their old one was bought 2-3 years ago

I built my own PC 5 years ago, just upgraded GPU and another SSD, but a good Windows reinstall makes it seem like a new PC every year 




 Did you tell him he can download more ram? 




 If you find a 970 for around 350, no. The 290X is notorious for high power consumption, heat and cooling issues 




 I work at Staples in tech and have these people trying to buy i7s and 8GB ram laptops for their grandpa who uses it for email and web surfing. I explain they don't need that much, but I won't stop them from giving us more money. 




 And having the most RAM is the most important thing 




 I got a Dell XPS with the same i5 and other specs as a macbook pro but it cost $500 less. 




 Why?
