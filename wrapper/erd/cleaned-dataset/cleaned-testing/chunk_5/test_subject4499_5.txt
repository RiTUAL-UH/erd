 Thank you very much. How have I not seen this before, so awesome. 




 Hey can you link me to that amazing wallpaper? 




 What's that from? 




 Left. 




 Nope. 




 No open? 




 It's not the actual live track, just the album version dubbed over some footage. 




 Alcoholism if I remember correctly. 




 Two drips two pounds 




 Looks unofficial. I once bought a similar tool documentary back when I was naive and border line mentally retarded, and it was the worst shit ever. 









 Apparently it's a little old lady who doesn't mind at all, I was also told she has 24 hour surveillance. 

I got to wondering if she acquired the house after the show ended? Or if she owned it the entire time and have to vacate during filming? 









 It's a nice place. 




 Thanks! I'll try and come up with something. 




 Yeah I can't part with one if my opiates but I have lots of Internet high fives.

What do the dimensions have to be? 




 Few things in my basement, quickly snapped these with a fresh russet (sorry).

EDIT: I love how my contribution which is directly pertinent to the post topic was downvoted. Sigh.  




 Seconded.  




 Bleh 




 Let's send the mods flowers and see if they respond. 




 I would welcome any change my friend. 




 Was it a limited addition bottle? 









 I swear to the cosmos I was just about to edit my comment to clarify this. 




 This would actually be the most relevant theme actually. Good idea.

 What a fucking hilarious comment, Jesus Christ I almost woke my kids up. 




 He did that here in Calgary too. Pretty sure it's common. 




 I get why Alex Grey's net of being is posted up above, but I'd love to see a change. Maybe something more classic. Is there anyway I can initiate change other than submitting a bitchy self post? It would be awesome to see something from Undertow or Aenima up there.

 Sorry I do not have any. 




 Dear god that looks amazing. I've only ever lurked in this sub before, this has been the first thing to make me come out of the shadows. I definitely want to give this a try. Thank you. 




 I'm positive they would have to. 




 Thanks, I keep forgetting about that. 




 [Explanation](http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/#!/content/1.2675839) 









 Hahahaha 




 Can you imgur pictures of the items? 




 Big fan of Village Wit.  




 Looking for a good hutch/dresser stand for our living room. Have anything that fits the description? If so what are the dimensions? Thanks! 




 That's because us fliers are simply cash cows, so fuck us.  




 Season 3 Episode 16; Bart The Lover. 




 The Knife has never hit me like Fever Ray.

It suits Jesse's relapse so well AND she's the only woman on the planet who would make me consider leaving my wife (whom I'm happily married to). 




 Alright alright, point taken. 




 I am just tossing out the idea, I haven't heard anything myself. It would be awesome though. 




 Is there any word on a 20th anniversary release?

EDIT: I for one am really excited to relive some Halo 3 action. Hoping this is accurate. 




 Well I wouldn't go as far as physical, we've only made out a couple of times. 




 I can't help tit. 




 Sorry, I am a dumb. 




 That was the joke. A play on the saying "Where's your God now?"
 




 I knew I couldn't be the only one of us. 









 Very cool. Thanks. 




 Thank you! 




 WHERE'S YOUR COD NOW? 




 Sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm way out of the loop on what's going on, does this mean there will be re-mastered version of each multiplayer? Or only H2, and re-mastered campaigns of the other games? I currently have 2 babies in diapers and a job that demands 190% of my effort in life so my attention to gaming has dropped, again my apologies. 




  So, in 2020?

My inside sources are telling me 2024. 




 Yeah me too. 




 mark my words...

I'll try and remember to come back to this on album release day. 




 Thank you. 




 I've been going through the comment section of this thread here and I think the guy you wrote about is downvoting everything you write. You wrote "Thank you" and got downvoted, what the hell. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/7Tzkhim.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7Tzkhim.jpg) 




 Absolutely, I do cherish every moment at this stage. I just can't help but feel like a terrible parent every time I break away and I hear his screams with "daaaaaaad" echoing over the stairs, through the door way, or out the window. 




 I needed to hear this, thanks. 




 My oldest son is almost 22 months, and for the past little while I cannot leave his presence (use the washroom, make/take a phone call, run errands etc etc.) without him throwing an absolute nightmarish tantrum. Up until now I've more or less shrugged it off, but I've got to thinking that *maybe* it's some form of separation anxiety. Now I'm wondering if this is normal and maybe just a phase kids go through. Just wondering if any of you have advice. Thanks! 




 Yes. 




 [This is what came to my mind.](http://youtu.be/8yiqGtZXCmQ) 




 "*I'm a reasonable man, get off my case.*" 




 Industrial Children 




 Good work, love this. 




 [http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/26fwwe/please_pay_attention/](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/26fwwe/please_pay_attention/) 




 Yeah, it was my sarcastic attempt at getting the message across. Maybe in hindsight I could have used a better approach, but what is done is done now, and I'll go down with the ship. Not every post comes off as it's intended, such is text based communication. 




 I'd like to say Glass Casket are somewhat similar. Dustie and Blake play for them. 




 Haha, I've been there. It's funny to be a dick, even if no one else thinks so. 




 Yeah I hear ya. I think most people operate like that. It's a faceless world we live in. I try to keep it on the level both on the Internet and in real life, but sometimes I too feel like calling people out on their bullshit. 




 Look at the position of the picture I linked up above, unless the passenger reached over and took a picture from the drivers perspective I don't know how else to explain it. 

That was the point of my title, to get a rise. However unlike you, I don't need a separate troll account for the occasional troll. 




 Will do thanks. Can you help me understand why you think taking pictures on the highway is ok? Or why you think the person behind the wheel of a motorized vehicle should be doing ANYTHING other than paying attention to the road. Apparently common courtesy is too much to ask from you young bucks with nothing to lose.  

EDIT: I just went through your comment history, it's pretty obvious this is your troll account. I think I'll stop here haha. 




 Orly? Please tell us more. Your juvenile use of the English language tells me you're well versed on the topic. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/z0EqqdD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/z0EqqdD.jpg) 




 To feed the trolls or not, I always find the decision difficult. 









 I approve of this message. 




 Good thing you whipped out your cell phone for a quick picture. Nothing like sacrificing your life and the lives around you for several imaginary internet points. 









 Met girl.
Moved in.
Got married.
Bought house.
Bought truck.
Had two children. 




 Agreed. Nice tat. 




 That is awesome. I've always wanted to get this inked but could never come up with a nice design. I may have to draw inspiration from this if that's ok haha. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/yV4kXEC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yV4kXEC.jpg)

I'd be willing to throw in a month of gold for the best submission if that helps. Also, since this is for my work SFW would be best. Thanks in advance. 




 Whole heartedly agree with this statement. 




 Yes. The ocular orifice. Check my "edit" haha. 




 Aenima.

Edit: [Very much Aenima](http://i.imgur.com/sL1ak.jpg) 




 Haha. 




 Probably due to the over all gloomy disposition of its sound. My son is only 21 months old and we listen to "what does the fox say" 20 times a day. 




 At his age let him explore the music himself. Right now he's probably best off taking it at face value and listening solely to the music anyways. As adults here we can appreciate the fact this song is about mourning a loved one, a mother at that, hence why I thought it was appropriate for the day.  




 It's just one of those "appreciate what you have while you have it" deal.  




 I'm in Calgary, we have horrible winters here too. So many days I've been dealing with what seems like this exact scenario. 




 I saw them last year, my friend being a huge fan wanted to go so I went along. I walked out with a feeling of "meh" while he was vibrating with excitement. Different strokes for different folks I suppose. I definitely respect them, but their art just doesn't speak to me. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/VgPyFfo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VgPyFfo.jpg) 














 I've never put much thought into Edmonton as to actually form an opinion, but now I'm convinced, Edmonton is a shit hole and I hate it. 




 Thought this could be useful here.

 I have seen that, but can't remember anything about it at all. That sounds hilarious though, good times. 




 Perhaps. 




 "Rock band 'Tool' from Los Angeles, California busted in an LSD distribution operation. Will they find out the true meaning of Prison Sex? Stay tuned as the story unfolds tonight at 11." 




 No I'm good thanks. 




 No, it's definitely part of the packaging. I'm going to go with everyone else in this thread and say it's a representation of LSD. 




 That. Is. Hilarious.  




 Ok, get back to you in a bit.

EDIT: Nothing happened. 




 See I thought that, but wasn't sure. 




 I may get burned at the stake for this, but [Dlek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A4lek) as an opening act was so unexpected and original I was blown away. Especially when they broke out the laptops to help out on lateralus, it was amazing. 




 [This is when I saw Isis open](http://www.imgur.com/EXN0blO) 









 Oh my God I just busted out laughing like a fucking idiot in front of 10 people. 




 I seriously would not sleep in the same building as that thing. 









 I picture a Ned Flanders type just blindly throwing hay makers into a crowd. 




 Love this comment and your user name. We should be friends. 




 Ah I see, sorry for reacting like a dick haha. Kudos. 




 It's an x-post, so yeah, thanks though. 









 [Nope](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-44VhwSg5xw4/UYL1V2Llq2I/AAAAAAAAJ9U/Cc_5cNjCRIM/s1600/pet1.jpg)

 What do you mean by go through them? The only option I can see is rearrange or delete.

EDIT: [This guy explains it pretty well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBMyP27ACpQ) 




 I truly believe this to be a complex question as I cannot find a solid answer elsewhere on the teh internet.
