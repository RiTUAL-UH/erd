 I take him out everyday so he can run around in the yard. I also play with him at least two times a day. I try to wear him out but he's still young-ish (1.5 years) and it seems he never runs out of energy! I wish I could get another cat but that won't be feasible until next year. 




 I've been busy lately and admittedly haven't been spending enough time with my cat. He pretty much demands constant attention. Anyway, lately he has been nibbling on my arm or leg. It's like a gentle bite. I would get mad at him because I really don't like being bitten no matter how gentle. Anyway, lately now whenever he does it he'll start to get... aggressive? It's like he's playfighting but it's doesn't feel playful and I've never encouraged him to playfight with me ever before. I usually play with him with his lure toys, etc. Is he mad because he feels neglected? 




 I had two jobs where I was under qualified. The first one was when I was 21 maybe and it was as an onsite administrator assistant. It was a small company and I felt they really really did not need an assistant because I had nothing to do all day. I also had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.

Then there was the summer job I had recently. I was a coordinator of sorts. I was in charge of a dozen people from 9-5 and my job was to supervise them but also coordinate their training program. I had to make up their schedule and hire people to train them. I think 50% of the the job was knowing the right people and networking. I didn't know the right people and I had to learn quickly how to network. It was very stressful and has honestly led to my recent depression. Though I felt I could have done a thousand times better in so many ways my bosses are happy with my work so I guess it wasn't all bad. 




 He's probably in his 80s. Drinks a lot. I hear he's sober now which is surprising. But before he used to drink with his alcoholic friends on his porch and yell obscenities to the women walking by. He also passed out with a pan on his hot stove that caused a lot of smoke. He was fine and so was his house. My town gets some sick entertainment whenever they hear firetruck sirens 'cos the town is otherwise dead and nothing is going on. So quite the crowd. For awhile he didn't have proper sanitation and I'm pretty sure he used a honey bucket lined with garbage bags because those garbage bags he left for the town's garbage collectors to pick up was pretty squishy. My dad calls him the world's best neighbour. 

He did help me though when I was taking my dog out on a walk. My town lets their dogs run loose if they're not tied up year round. I make sure mine are collared and leashed when I take them out. Well a vicious dog was too interested in my dog and they were both getting aggressive with each other. World's best neighbour came to my rescue and scared the other dog off with a few rocks and kicks when I was struggling to keep my own dog in check while scaring away the other dog. 




 I think he'll just have to be happy with my company until I can get a second cat! Thanks for the advice. 




 Cats are REALLY weird. 




 For some reason I thought cats were social animals! I guess I've spent too much time with dogs to know the difference. I think I'll just stick to what I'm doing then and next year when I'm able I'll just get a second cat. Thanks for the advice and info. 




 I live in a townhouse that has a shared fenced courtyard. I recently adopted a cat and he's settled into his new home. I've started taking him out everyday with a harness and leash. At first he was scared but now seems to look forward to his daily outing into the courtyard. I just follow him wherever he goes and if he's up for it I'll play with him with one of his toys. But I've noticed that my neighbour lets her cat out everyday too. The cats notice each other but don't walk up to each other and if my cats becomes too interested in the other cat I pick him up and distract him with something else. My parents have a small dog that tries to pick fights with other dogs so I have a bad experience of introducing dogs to each other. I'm wondering if it'll be the same with my cat? Is it okay if my cat wanders towards the neighbours cat and say hello? Honestly, I just want my cat to have a playmate, he likes his new home but he's very playful and at times seems lonely. 




 The only grocery store in my town doesn't allow dogs. When I first got my dog I would walk him to the grocery store but I didn't want to leave him outside because there is a ton of stray dogs in my town so I took him into the store with me. I carried him through the aisles. Anyway, they now have a no pets allowed policy. 




 I actually had this conversation with a friend of mine. I told him didn't exactly have standards but was looking for someone who shared my values. Someone who believes in God, is a moderate Liberal and has strong family values since I do love kids and would love to have a big family one day. But I think I would also like someone who plays video games (BF4, Skyrim), doesn't mind me dragging them to the latest romcoms, and laughs at my dry-ish humour, and someone who has shelf full of books. I really don't like people who smoke or smoke up and prefer someone who is a social drinker who doesn't become dramatic once they've had a drink. Also, I'm fairly spoiled since I'm the youngest girl in my family, so someone who can accept that about me and doesn't make me feel guilty about it.

Edit: Forgot to add liking country music. It's 90% of what I listen to and I go to a lot of country concerts. 




 I like country music so whatever is on country radio. 




 Yep. Scared of driving but only because I'm pretty sure I'm the bad driver. 




 Dixie Chicks (Natalie Maines), Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood. So many really. 




 I don't mind her music but her voice is great and the only reason I buy her albums. 




 I'm not familiar with the newer Pokemon but Jigglypuff was always my favourite. 




 I have a few: Dixie Chicks, Rilo Kiley, First Aid Kit, Miranda Lambert. I have a ton more but when it comes down to it these are the singers/bands that I'll never tire of. 




 Divergent and City of Bones. The movies aren't great but they're a helluva lot better than the books. 




 YES. It drives me crazy when I hear kids/teen saying they are bored. My grandma would lecture me as a kid/teen whenever I said I was bored. My mom would lecture me as well if she heard me say anything about being bored. "Read a book then, there's a bible right there." Uh, no that's okay, I found something to do. 




 All of them. Except uniforms. That I understand. 




 Yes, this. When I worked at a movie theatre it was the people who demanded fresh popcorn when they had just been popped not 5 minutes ago. We just put them in the display to make it easier to grab. 




 I told my sister of the sin of the vertical video. I have yet to tell my mom.
