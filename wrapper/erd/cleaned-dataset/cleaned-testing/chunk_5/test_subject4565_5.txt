 My immune system is the shit. Are you telling me that I'm going to be attracted to girls who get sick all the time? 




 There are jawns everywhere. I need to make a new name.

 Kim Jong Un has. 




 I love your username. 




 It's a sad day. 




 Oh my good lord sweet baby Jesus.  




 According to the top comments, they are for a large part publicly funded, and the drug companies are pocketing the difference. Big Pharma is notoriously unethical. This is nothing that should shock people, as things like this have been happening for a very long time. Now the question should be, 'what can/should we do about it?' 




 Somebody gild this guy.

Synchronicity is real. 




 So... did they at least give him his $700,000 check back? 




 I'm approaching year 6-7 right now. Statute of limitations... almost... there... 




 The name is clever indeed. I was more thinking what are the odds that someone with that name happens to read this particular comment in this particular thread. Seems like it happens all the time.  




 That sucks. I'd send you a picture of my dick but I get the feeling you wouldn't appreciate it. 

Nobody ever appreciates it :( 




 How many Parmesans did you bring?

 You tryin to sell that couch on Craigslist? 

I got tree fitty. 




 Here's one, although this article deals mainly with the danger associated with taking too much in one dose.

It does say this, however:

Tramadol is an increasingly commonly prescribed painkiller  prescriptions have almost doubled in the past seven years, from 5.9million in 2006 to 11.1million in September 2012.

Its popularity has soared partly because its cheap  now available as a non-branded generic drug, it costs the NHS 1.99 for 100 tablets.

Fears about other painkillers have also made tramadol an attractive option.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) are linked to side-effects such as indigestion, stomach ulcers, a perforated gut.

One of these drugs, Vioxx, was withdrawn in 2005 because of a link to heart attack and stroke.

Meanwhile, another painkiller, co-proxamol, was withdrawn after concerns about it being used in suicides.

Tramadol  which also comes under brand names including Zydol and Zamadol  is a synthetic opioid drug, similar to natural opioids derived from poppy seeds, such as morphine.

Its prescribed to prevent or treat moderate to severe pain after surgery, toothache or long-term pain conditions including back pain, fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.

Tramadol is regarded by many doctors as a weaker opioid. But in fact it has the same risks of overdose as with morphine. 




 I despise Xanax and the effects it has on people. I think they should stop prescribing it altogether.   




 Adderall or K-pins cut my anxiety when I need. Although long term use and high dosage of those is not much better in terms of harm to your body. 




 Its your body, man. But I would be extremely careful with that shit. Just my two cents. Look into it yourself online. 

You have really tried everything else?  




 I'll take your finest chemical cocktail, on the rocks. 




 I heard this shit is *extremely* bad for your organs.  




 I'll allow it. 




 Please don't let this be North Korea. 




 I would beat the shit out of said best friend. 

If he's associating with that guy as a best friend, I think he has a right to know that said friend is a piece of shit. 

The truth shall set you free.  




 "I can't feel my legs, Forrest..." 




 Craigslist is great for used electronics, depending on where you're located. I would definitely supplement your ebay postings with identical posts on craigslist. Since the CL posting is free, there is no risk of loss for you. If the item sells through CL, then you remove it from eBay and vice versa.  




 "Jersey Devil, you're my only friend." 




 I love you. 




 The social is the hardest piece of necessary information to obtain these days. Everything else tends to be pretty easily accessible online.

When I stopped selling on ebay, i wasn't too disappointed as fees were increasing and final selling prices were waning. I started selling locally on Craigslist with better results, and have also recently considered opening an Etsy store because much of the stuff I deal with is vintage/antique. 

The main reason I stopped selling on eBay however was Paypal.  




 In other news... the amount of people killed yearly by falling/malfunctioning/hacked drones is about to increase. 




 Ok, now lemme get a recipe for bangin' Pot-Pesto. 




 Texas license plate: Check

Anti-Obama bumper sticker: Check

4x4 w/ steel bars over the grill and headlights for running down illegals in the desert: Check 




 With how susceptible their company/customer information is to electronic theft/hacking, I would be worried about having anything like that on file with them. Fortunately my life was not inconvenienced in the least when I deactivated my account and discontinued use of their terribly inconvenient service.  









 Get 'em, Gronk!

 Last time I tried to sign up for PayPal, they demanded a copy of my Drivers License, SOCIAL SECURITY CARD, and recent utility bill.

Who in their right mind would send this terrible company a digital copy of their SOCIAL SECURITY CARD?  




 Not sure, but looks like a Garter Snake... which is pretty much the most common and harmless of all the snake brethren.  




 It probably will be soon. 




 Also, as far as the feathers on top of the hat, do you think they could be eagle feathers? They looked quite large. I feel like that would be appropriately symbolic.  




 I actually just saw it today at a local used book store that I used to work at, while browsing. The owner goes to a lot of auctions and estate sales so they have stuff all over the place. I am probably going to go back and buy it tomorrow, because he'll probably give it to me for around $10. Either way, I will certainly snap a photo(s) of it and post some links. It's quite an interesting piece. 

The style of the crown itself was more identical to the first one you linked to.  




 Hey, thanks for that great info. In the symbol I saw, the crown was much smaller in proportion to the triangle and positioned entirely inside the triangle, at the center. That could simply be because it is older than the medal you linked to. I would say you are most likely correct and that my hat is the hat of a royal arch mason from the early 1900's. Thanks again.

 




 I think you should capitalize all the words in your title, correct? 
 




 So... you gonna eat that? 




 Bless you. 




 Are you lying, bro? 




 Am... am I pregnant? 




 As simple as this symbol seems, I can't seem to locate another example anywhere. It is that of a simple thin golden triangle with a crown in the center. The crown looks similar to that which the British use in their military insignias from WW1. 

Unfortunately I did not snap a picture of the exact logo. I would however be able to update tomorrow with one if necessary. The symbol is located front and center of the hat above the brim. The hat is in very rough condition, as it is very old. The hat manufacturer is called The M. C. Lilley Co. and they were established a few years after the civil war and are based out of Ohio USA. They are known for manufacturing military gear/uniforms as well as Masonic gear/uniforms. I could not locate the symbol, or anything similar, while using various keywords related to both subjects. 

Oddly, there are also large feathers sort of woven into the top of the hat. Not sure if that is original or was done after the fact.

Any help identifying this triangle/crown symbol would be greatly appreciated! 




 Great answer, thanks man! I will do some research with the link you provided.  




 Da fuck you lookin at nigga? 




 WTF am i looking at? I love it. 

What made these and how were they made?

I imagine this is what it looks like to smoke DMT while tripping on acid.
