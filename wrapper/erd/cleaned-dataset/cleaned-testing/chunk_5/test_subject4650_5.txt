 All depends on how far you can see.  




 Nah we just like to live dangerously. :D 




 Camera bike is indeed a 10r 




 You wouldn't change gears there though would you? I mean, you ride first for a bit before hooking second.  




 Try 'em with cream cheese, that's my tip! :D 




 Yes sir! Well spotted. 




 Lake Mountain, VIC. Get into it!  




 That's stunning slow mo! I wanna know why the extra clutch grab once the bike was already up - that's odd. Watching what happens on the throttle side is pretty scary too.  




 Lucky man. Last time a chain snapped on me it whipped up, beheaded an indicator, chainsawed the ducktail and made a bit of a mess inside the sprocket cover. I had a passenger on too, thank christ the chain guard did its job.  




 Heh heh can't be too careful eh! Anyway, I'm the guy in front on the grandpa bike.  




 I woulda spent some time making it loop better if gfycat gave you fine control. Top piece of road but!  









 Ganglebangers.  




 How about this one? 

Samsung 'Dinner Party': http://youtu.be/0ZzF2UO13T0 




 Samsung owner here - Samsung ads make my fucking skin crawl. I'm with ya.  




 Eeeeeverybodyyyy jerrrrrks... Sooooome tiiiiiiiiiiiimes..... 




 It's almost as if they want the west to go in and attack them. 




 What about those of us who think it plays directly into the hands of the enemy? It's what these pricks have been begging for all along. 




 If you go out trying to be a dick to people, and people say "you're being a dick" you shouldn't act all surprised. OP baited christians and reeled one in, of course he's being disrespectful. That was the point all along.  




 My point is whoever made the sticker knew they were being disrespectful, as did the person that stuck it on their car. There's no reason to have it if you're not baiting.  




 These days, just something some christians stick on their cars.  




 Why would you get that sticker if you weren't being disrespectful? It's a Jesus fish with a different god in it.  It's designed to be disrespectful.  




 It was a beautiful reminder of our mortality and how fleeting youth and beauty can be. I watched it on the shitter and shed a tear while wiping my butt. That was an odd experience.  




 Indeed. Could have cut down on the wank factor.  




 99% invisible steps into those areas occasionally and is otherwise pretty beaut.  




 That and it made my penis go numb.  




 Hahaha indeed! 




 No point in doing reviews if you can't find a way to have a whinge. That's why I've gotta stop doing superbikes, what the hell can your average mug like me say about those things?   









 Told me? I was official scorekeeper! 




 My brother managed 10 times in 2 hours the first time he tried ecstasy.  




 Tough luck pac-man. You're eating the brown pills today.  




 It's a joke that reveals what you think about the situation.  




 You are blaming the victim, that's exactly what you're doing. Heaps of people take naked pictures of themselves, for whatever reason, and that's their business, and if they fuck up and put it in the wrong place that's their fault. If somebody steals them from a place they believe is secure, that's another entirely. They probably had no idea that their stuff was going to the cloud. It's all automatic.  




 They're a really nice little bike. Engine from the days when you didn't have to rev the piss out of them. Would make a good stunter. Have fun!  




 Could be the other way round. Screaming kids are an excellent motivator to want to get fucked up.  




 Gorgeous road.  




 Vine needs to fuck off and die. Sweet jam though!  




 Still gives me chills. 




 I sure did. Hope the video gave y'all a giggle! http://youtu.be/VohU0IjYUCY 




 I'm just on a plane now, the captain came on and said whatever the fuck he had to say and my brother said "nobody cares, John. Drive the fucking bus." 




 Your brother can start another PS3 user account... 




 "You might say he's Kelloggian, is that a word?" is how I heard it... 




 The Easter Basket is what it's called round here.  




 Jeez, it was dragging on the ground for less than half a second and it still got cheese grated through the leather. 




 I accidentally gave it a try.

It went OK. 




 Best for fun: speed triple.  




 Fuck you, I don't have to like it. I like watching great players struggle to overcome obstacles, not have rings handed to them.  




 Absolutely stunning work. Sheer magnificence.  




 They should wheel him out and sit him in a corner somewhere to throw lobs and nail threes and be devastatingly nice to opponents.  




 No Gazey. :( 




 God yes. 




 Good for quick cheap prototyping and full color models. The results can be hardened to a pretty solid form by soaking in some sort of glue. Stuff that isn't post treated in this way can start flaking in the finicky bits. But yeah, very cheap as they use regular 80gsm paper.  




 Wow, I never realised he was no jive-talkin' wigger. 




 Holy shit, different suspension for front and rear? Where do I sign? 




 Cleveland: the new Heatles. I was ready to get behind LeBron, but superteams are just icky. 




 As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.

Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers. 




 The fountain of youth... I think that's what happens when we try to change his nappy. 









 I dunno where in the world you are, but it's generally about as much as a Panigale.  




 The EBR possibly steers and handles a touch quicker, it's very enjoyable in corners. The BMW has a more flexible and more powerful engine, but it's a total computer bike and something like 33% of them have reliability issues, is what I'm reading. They've all got their individual character that will speak to different riders.  




 But... But I wasn't! I was saying it's a better all-rounder!  




 End of the day, Erik wants to be in that top 3, and he wants to race at the highest level.  




 The SX is basically exactly the same bike with the plastics off. Same gearing, same power, same torque and yep, same clutch. Better start working your forearm muscles!  




 Well cheers mate. I did a vid on your bike too, couple years back: Ducati Multistrada 1200 S Review: http://youtu.be/zyZ64Ef-yaY 




 On the bike, it's a Sena 20S headset (SMH10 would be almost as good and cheaper), through a GP10 backpack thingy for the GoPro. Wind noise is cancelled to virtually zero, and the audio is synced straight up with the vision. You can also record intercom conversations if you're out with multiple riders.

It's a great motovlogging setup, being able to talk on the bike means I don't have to shoot nearly as much footage off the bike as I used to - so I'm less reliant on having a cameraman around!

 Haha bush mechanics FTW! 




 That's fine in theory - but I'd say looks play a big part in the majority of bike buying decisions, like it or not! 









 Cheers! I'm gonna get a sleep study done in the next couple weeks. Thanks for the feedback.
 




 Hey there - I'm sleeping like shit and starting to investigate the idea of a CPAP machine too. What do you reckon? Worth a go? Did they make you feel more rested in the mornings? 




 I'd get more distortion at 12 mm. I reckon this is a 16 mm.  




 I think you need to put him on the level of guys like Valentino Rossi and Michel Schumacher - who not only dominated their sports, they transcended them to the point where the whole world started to take notice. 




 Fair go, he led the league in a pretty significant stat category this year, as well as leading the league in dunks. I think there's a discussion to be had.  




 Looks a bit like Michael Jackson.  




 Me too - bear with me here, I might be completely off track, but imagine the ball is your bodyweight. You come down hard on the shoe. The old shoes dissipate that force and don't bounce you back up. The new shoes seem to return most of that downward force back upwards.

How is that a good thing? 




 A ball would bounce much higher on concrete than on a trampoline.  




 ...wouldn't that throw more landing shock back up through the knee? 




 How many people burned their jerseys though? 20 would seem like a high number to me.  




 He was put on this earth to make the rest of us feel lazy.  




 ...riiiiiight... 




 Deke Sharon did a version I think.  




 Prostate massage would be doubly penetrative.  




 That's certainly what I thought when I saw it. Maybe it originated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Do5Nc8yIjk 




 NO TAG FOR YOU 




 "I like motorcycles because ANUS."

Fair enough.   




 Passionate and talented writers, photographers and filmmakers are exactly the people they should be giving prime access to. This is great publicity for everyone. He's demonstrated his ability, both to create strong content and to get it seen. He should get a press pass to whatever he wants now.  




 It's a 7 footer's move, and a really hard one. Big guys get it super easy all the way into the NBA. You'd need a very rare package of size, coordination, skill and dedication to develop that shot.  




 You just drill riders into your stock triples, you don't need to get a whole new jigger!
 




 KTM motorcycles all use WP suspension - stands for White Power but I think they're fairly keen to move on from that. :) 




 Aye, and a flat bar too.  




 Fair few there I'd never seen before... Awesome! 




 Nope. But go nuts if you're worried. You'll start out pretty slow - remember you're watching some super skilled riders in these clips. You're a god damned champion if you start hitting those kinds of lean angles.  




 I often go out to an empty carpark at night and run slow circles and figure 8s with a buddy or two. It's fucking hard work but you come away feeling like a god.  




 I dunno, he looked pretty fuckin' buggered when he hit the bench!  




 Scary motherfucker.  




 Wade shits me no end, and this play is part of the reason. Gets the great dunk, then goes out of his way to turn around and step over the guy to try to create a Pippen/Iverson moment. Wanker.  




 Best bike in the whole world ever.  




 A mate stacked my bike years ago, and it had ball-marks in the tank too. I just can't think of what else could cause it...  




 Degrees cost a lot of money. All well and good to get good marks, but some people are in it to learn stuff and challenge themselves!  




 God, he looked stiff as a board to me. It looked like everything hurt.  




 Ugh. Got his money's worth, I guess... 




 Retina MBP is what I use, it's a beauty. The extra resolution is incredibly useful on a a small screen.  




 Yeah I'm not seeing that kind of nonchalant dominance out of the 2014 Draft class... At least, not yet.  




 Deng was an iron man in Chicago. He'll be a key piece if the heat do well.  




 Great collection, she can be proud! 




 Godspeed, Teabag Tornado.

 I thought the judder was Dani chucking a tanty.  




 He's one of those guys with a stupid face.  




 "This shoe is as wide as yo momma's ass.  




 Search eBay for "size 12 4E" and you can pick from all the shoes of the rainbow.

 He's a real nickelbucketpuncher, that guy, yeah.  




 The one dunk I ever got in a basketball game. I should add, it was a D-grade women's game and I was refereeing at the time. 

I'd spent several hours a day between the ages of 17 and 20 obsessed with trying to dunk. But as a 5'11 white guy the odds were stacked against me. Still, when the stars aligned I could get up there, I just couldn't quite palm the ball to get it down. A volleyball? No worries. A netball? I was throwing those down like Dr. J. Basketballs just eluded me. 

So there I am, bored out of my mind reffing this game, and one of the girls lumbers out on a "fast" break. I'm jogging behind her, the layup goes up, time slows down and my pupils dilate. 

I saw the sit - the ball was going to teeter on the front of the rim. I could just feel it. And instinct kicked in. I wasn't going to miss my chance. 

I took three quick steps and launched, grabbed the ball, and slammed it down with all my strength, shouting like a caveman. I landed triumphantly, threw my head back and hollered. 

And then I saw the confused faces of the players, blew my whistle and gave somebody a sideball. 

Best part was, as we got started again a kid on the sideline burst out in tears, wailing "no Jordans! No Jordans! "

Made my year.  




 I thought it roughly translated to "oh my god I finally got some attention, now I have no idea what to do with it. "
