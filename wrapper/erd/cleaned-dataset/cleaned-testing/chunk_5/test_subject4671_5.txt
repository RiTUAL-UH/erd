 actually you caught it iirc 




 don't worry..they now made it so no one can watch it.... 




 6pm tonight iirc 




 haha its cool...i was planning on typing it out myself 




 HAHA way to post while game still going. 




 if you watch from the mlg site there is a pull down with says "streams". Select Starcraft Blue(or if you are a gold member select premium 1/premium2) to view other matches being broadcast. If you use twitch to view I think its twitch.tv/mlgstarcraftb. If you watch from embedded player in Team Liquid select MLG Blue instead of MLG Red. 

Basically its a second stream with premier casters/games. Yesterday it was used to broadcast WCS. Today it will probably be stream end of that tourni and/or other games from MLG brackets. 




 blue stream 




 take your first maurader and pull scv's and go win with that force? Alternatively...super early 3rd 




 there is another guy who posted asking for a ride...maybe you two could swap and trade off etc? http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ynh64/mlg_raleigh_this_weekend/ 




 i think its more that the Seattle fans have been begging for a real tournament event and they thought they finally got one only to actually be getting a UMS map.

 yeah i thought about going to play (#1 rank plat what what) but i really want to be able to watch games and it seems like the live experience isn't conducive to that. :-/ and i'm not hyped about many of the participants either 




 ahh I'll also note that the Raliegh event is usually severely under-hyped...its seems most players hate attending it. I live in VA and have friends who went last year say it was very lack luster
 




 aren't the 8 open spots just the qualifiers from open bracket like normal? Or is there an additional 8 spots? 




 not really. He aid every time he has watched supernova he has gone bio first game and mech second game vs zerg. It was an intelligent prediction 




 i believe i saw MLGAdam somewhere in this thread say its 4 streams this time as opposed to the 2 last time. 




 for *two tournaments. Remember WCS NA is at the event too 




 Notes as I go through

* 2nd depot too early...should be built by scv that is building rax(heck you could even go 2nd CC before 2nd supply depot)
* it seems to me like your two gases are really late(especially since you have 150 minerals left still after you build them)
* also you said you wanted to do early pressure with helions....so why 3 rax? that's counter-intuitive. if you place 2x refinery down after expansion you can go into reactor expand pretty quickly.
* you built rax on high ground and then lowered them to low ground....just build them on low ground if you want to use them to wall off...better would be supply depot wall off.
* a scan around 6:30 would be really nice so you could no if he is all inning you or has taken a quick 3rd as you have 0 scouting
* good news: at 7 minute mark you are ahead on workers. bad news: its bc your opponent is not droning hard. lol
* ALSO. 1000 minerals floating at 7 minutes!!!!! Thats so much! Thats 2 CC's or 20 marines that you could be pushing with...
* at the 10 minute mark you still have 0 scouting...what if he has mutas? also...still floating money...also you only have 45 scv's...try to hit 50 off a 1 rax expand at 10 minute mark...also you are just starting upgrades. no bueno
* at the end your opponent is floating 2k/2k....a good zerg would kill you with that.

not trying to be harsh...just saying if you can clean up these issues you will be even better :)
 




 they showed the winner...AMD 




 I posted this replay a while ago...sounds like the +1/+1 medivac push i do thats built off of polt

http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476 




 i think he a paragraph

EDIT OH SNAP ITS MY CAKE DAY! 




 this sounds nice in theory but i don't no about practically. In the TvT i don't think my factory had started when i saw blue flame...i rushed to starport and didn't get anything out until after his harass with banshees.

I was trying to use those first helions to pick off some lings and i definitely got caught not looking at them...i failed to raise my depot in my main which is what really cost me the game(my frustration at the end was bc i kept trying to raise it and it wouldn't raise). Doesn't building a second factory mean i'm forced into mech? I HATE playing mech.  




 So in my last 6 matches I've lost all of them to early pressures/all ins or styles of build that i saw coming and I reacted to obviously poorly. For example. I was playing a TvT...saw he had 13 gas and I was playing 1 rax fe style. I scanned again around 6 minutes and saw he was doing the blue flame helion/cloaked banshee build. I built turrets in my mineral line and bunkers for my marines. I suffered some damages from the banshees because my opponent exploited the areas i din't have covered by turrets but overall i thought i was minimal....but still my build is thorzain build which masses marines which SUCK against blue flame helion as i found out when i went for a +1/+1 medivac timing ....so whats the appropriate way to respond?

Likewise, each of my last 5 games against zerg have been roach/bane or bane/ling all ins that i scout with my scan...i put up multiple bunkers in reaction(to the reactionary race yeah right) and I still can't hold any of these. 

TLDR-I need help understanding how to react to builds i see

REPLAYS:

* vs Random who ended up being zerg http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=268966

* vs terran 
http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=268967

 




 i believe i saw something about a way to stand up in such a way that lowers the naseausness from doing pushups...I believe it was something like plant feet-slowly roll up while keeping chin tucked-raise head 




 So I watched this game and I believe you are asking the wrong question. A better question you should be asking yourself is why did I lose this game? Now it seems to me that the answer you have come up with is colossus..but that is not actually the point where you lost the game. I'm going to remark on a couple of things i saw that were glaring to me

* you open with 2 rax b ut never put on aggression sacrificing economy for an army you do nothing with. Please note the filtersc 1 rax expand and try it, learn it love it.

* you make your expansion in your m ain...you can actually make that at  your natural and build 1 bunker earlier to keep yourself safe. This will kick start your economy.

* at the 15 minute mark you still didn't have 50 workers. With a 1 rax expand the goal is to 50 workers by the 10 minute mark. meaning your economy was worse

* add ons...you actually can't afford to constantly produce out of the number of barax with those add ons...this led to you cutting scv's and delaying crucial tech like medivacs

this is just general comments....here is an example of me facing a protoss and my play.
note my scv count at the 10 minute mark and when i push(roughly between 10 and 11 minutes). Don't worry about the first push i did where I pulled scv's as i did that based on scouting the early nexus and is not something you should be worried about. Note my ghost academy comes down with my 3rd and my upgrades are decent ish...


Over all look at the filtersc timing guide for vs protoss..master it...win
 :D
http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=268850 




 can you attach a specific replay? i can give you general advice but a specific game might help better analyze what YOU specifically need to do. 




 in general it looks like he built a lot of cannons and tried to mass produce colossi and in general didn't spend his money. Remember that resource score also takes into account "unspent minerals" so its not the accurate of measures...he only had 50 probes to your 70 scv's + mules..you had a better economy by far.

yes...don't focus on targeting any specific units right now(except for maybe hotkeying your vikings and using them to target colossi). i'm in high plat and i'm JUST getting to the point where i can identify when target firing is beneficial. Rely on that macro :) 




 for a large part of the beginning of the game your main is not rallied to minerals so that provided worse eco for you..just a heads up

put those units in your bunker! if he had attacked with a couple sentries/zealots(which with what you scouted to this point aka double gas) would mean death to you

he failed to use his extra minerals on gateways/zealots. bad on him

look like when you maxed you either moved commanded or targeted the colossi with you bio resulting in you getting wrecked

in the end your marco ended up winning you the game...yay! 




 hmmm i've never noticed then using own3d for an arena...which have been where i've had issues. you could be right. 




 So I tuned into the LOL arena on MLG's page and right away i notice the Own3d logo. I'm really hoping they go this route for the future SC2 tournis too as twitch's ability to provide service has been fairly lackluster to this point. 




 He forgot to attack. He let Hero build up the air attack. He should have backed up and let the infestors regain energy...oh and he also received the InControl Kiss of Death. 




 I think the general consensus is that the builds you need to know are 
all variations of the one rax expand

TvT:Thorzain Build - Covered in a Day 9 Daily
TvP:Bomber Build - Covered in a Day 9 Daily.
TvZ:3 CC helion/banshee???? I'm actually not sure on this one. I do the Polt TvZ build covered in a Day9 Daily

I'm not a huge fan of Day but he does map these builds out pretty well and they should probably be your next step. However, Don't be afraid to stick with Filters 1 rax expand and start trying to react. You should be to the point where your macro is good enough to start testing out compositions/responses 









 a replay would be preferable but honestly pure macro should win you most games in silver. Remember that vs zerg your 10 minute push is to destroy his 3rd..if he doesn't have a 3rd(and you know this by scouting/scanning) then you can take your own third and start pressuring with drops. Those upgrades seem late. My 10 minute push hits with +1/+1 




 I'm only going to comment on the TvP as I don't feel knowledgeable enough in TvT to help you there.

* 1)you placed that second supply depot way way to early. Either the scv building your rax should start it right after the rax OR that scv should build your 2nd CC when you only have one marine and after that you build your 2nd depot. not game ending but less efficient
* 2)I personnally feel like your bunker is a little late...if he marches right across the map with a stalker and zealot you're screwed.
* 3)THIS IS THE BIGGEST: IF HE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPANSION BY THE 6:30-7Minute mark(which btw is a great time to scan) YOU HAVE TO BUNKER UP.

The build works assuming your opponent is macroing too...but now you have to start learning about what you are scouting and what it means and reacting appropriately. Hope that helps :) 




 i believe it was because every MLG we were basically taking over the front page and so everyone voted to not show top /r/starcraft  stuff 




 on the medivacs one i would suspect second gas goes up right when the starport starts...maybe slightly before. It seemed like a deviation of the polt two base marine push and i know thats the timing of the second gas in that build 




 they are clapping to the beat of the song silly
 




 Yeah I'm almost to the end of my second week. It is a very good program...although i don't know if i like it as much as p90x. I feel like i'm putting some muscle and some fat...we will see 




 league? i don't want to be offering my plat advice if you are masters bc my advice is probably worthless then. 




 Dargleins Micro Trainer. learn it, live it, love it...get dat APM 




 For me I turtle until i feel like I can control the muta flock(usually means one thor in the main and enough marines/turrets to protect each base in regards to the size of his flock-ie 7 mutas = less marines than 20 mutas). As soon as i feel safe i push out onto the map. Mutas are bad in straight up fights against upgraded marines and are used for map control, the sooner you can take that map control away the better imo. Please correct me if I'm doing this wrong master/diamond players 




 front page for this subreddit there is a place to assign flair on the left hand side near the top 




 no he isn't even in New York. said so on his twitter and in this subreddit yesterday. 




 Here are two replays of me vs zerg comp(just to show the builds). I \'m trying to decide which one is better. I currently do a late push with +1/+1 but that can mean i get shutdown by fungals. The earlier push would hit before high tier tech but be much weaker imo. Does it being earlier make up for that?

Early push: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267798

Later Push:http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267799 




 TIL Having mothership is useless without archons to use for archon toilet 




 game 1 cytoplasm vs hero is good. everything else was pretty one side. apparently Sasquatch was really close to beating Alicia but that wasn't shown on stream 




 its because adebisi isn't observing :(  




 yes. i just got a steel series and xperia play ad. 




 log in to mlg site. click the live tourniment at the top. Presto premium stream! 




 Why not hot key army to 5/6/7 since then you wont have to worry about relearning the other 4 production hotkeys? 5/6/7 are close enough to all major action buttons(T-stim, S/d-siege/unsiege, D-drop units, E-EMP) that you can hit all pretty easy. I have my army on 8/9/0 and i can do these well so i suspect you can too with groups even closer! 




 what about the monthly pass? its $20 per month and for me the price is worth it. 




 protoss don't seem to be going storm first any more in plat/low diamond. Maybe once i move up but its not something i have to concern myself with currently. 




 So right now here is my approach vs each race:


vs Protoss: I want to hit an early game timing. Needs to hit before the 11 minute mark as that's when first colossi tends to come out. I went to keep upgrades going. My Ghost academy should start when i take my third. I want the protoss to attack into me in a late game engagement so that I can maintain an arc and get EMP's. Later game Planetary Fortresses to create chokes while slowly transitioning to 3/3 BattleCruisers + ghosts w/ nukes.

vs Zerg - I want to deny the 3rd as long as possible: Including Ebay blocks. I want to have some early game harass(ie helions or marines in a bunker at the opponent 3rd). I want to feint pushes(walk to zelnaga's and back to my base) to try and force units instead of drones. I want fast upgrades(double ebay). I personally try to hit a strong +1/+1 stim medivac timing. Mass drops to allow me to build economy and start pressuring multiple locations. PREVENT 4th BASE at all costs!

vs Terran: Don't die in the early game....


As you can see I don't really have a good vs terran game plan. I don't know how to react to gas first if i'm planning on fast expand etc. How are you approaching each matchup from a high level 




 haha i'm platinum now using macro style games to improve. ^.^ Maybe i just suck at all in builds lol 




 bad english..i meant 4 medivacs total. Its the ideal composition for the terran late game deathball(or so i'm told). edited my previous statement for clarity 




 i keep seeing people say this but when i was playing 3 rax was geting stomped in silver. I think you should learn macro style as it helps you more once you get in the high leagues. 




 a)no banshees ever
b)after he shows DT's u drop several mules...need those scans
c)Lets assume we want to win off of 2 bases...maybe 3. watch your money as you attack...we need to keep it low so when we win a fight in the early game we can snowball our advantage
d)UPGRADES..GET EM EARLY AND OFTEN
e)you need 4 medivacs total and 3 vikings per a colossi....you had 10 ish medi's and 5 vkings which you suicided trying to kill A colossi
f)once you do get to let game...you have to start dropping planetaries, making ghost and let the protoss attack into you...its the best way to be cost effective

EDITED for clarity 




 it seems you have trouble marcoing while attacking. You were floating a lot of money. Also you always attacked in one place with your army allowing the protoss to fight in the death ball. You want to make him split up. Think of it as zerg. If you are at 3 and main at same time...one will be damaged. These are theories of SC2 that will help you in all matchups. I'm not going to nitpick micro cuz i'm plat too. 




 if you could pretty please link a replay? Its really hard to know how to advise you with out seeing how you currently play. It might be that you are doing a build that is countered by the current meta...or something that is small. At the plat level templar first has been pretty much phased out to heavy colossi play since templar can be abuse so easy 




 yeah i can't even connect to the site. so sad :( 




 yeah i can't connect to that :( 




 either is fine...i'd prefer the premium as i pay for it. 




 6:00 am eastern and I can't connect to gomtv.net to launch the live player for the Code A stream. It just seems offline. Any one have link to launch stream or instructions on how to do so from within the player? 




 that same tourni(MLG) Tubby beat Huk right after iNcontrol lost. He just didn't get the flack 




 did you even watch the games? Naniwa showcased brilliant innovation today. 




 has 103 subscribers and isn't active lol 




 I am getting a lot of lag on twitch and i have 25MB down currently. Any one else having issues. Located in USA on EST...I'm talking about lag on 360 even.. 




 you mean something like this:

and this:
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5IWP8i6HN_vZ2F3NWhkN3lRRFN2Z2lYT0dWVFMtUQ/edit 




 i felt my drops got shut down pretty tightly. 




 how do i keep the concave while attacking? I tried to spread out but as soon as i start attacking in everything balls up. :-/


EDIT: actually even better question...what is my priority list of things to do in an engagement. I know i need to EMP, target fire Vikings, stim, and kite. What is my priority on what order i need to do those? 




 i don't...i lose even when up 11 bases to 4 









 you should look at the filtersc tutorials(located on the right hand bar). While I could critique the facts that you expand slowly, don't scout, and don't macro particularly well those don't play a big roll in bronze/silver level play. Watch the guides. Perform them and you should start winning. 
 




 i haven't down voted anyone at all. :( I'm sad someone else has

EDIT: I just went through and upvoted everyone so that everyone is back where they were before the other person downvoted. 




 the theory is..if your opponent is fast expanding, if i do an immediate CC I will not compromise my army or my infrastructure and rather that both will be immensely stronger than the normal 1 rax fe. I'll have to go through my replay tonight to see if I'm correct in thought 




 you keep the 3rd in base until its safe to move out(approx 9 minute mark)
