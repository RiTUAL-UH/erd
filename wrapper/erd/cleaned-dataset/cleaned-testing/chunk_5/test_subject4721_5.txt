 Yes, it's a porterhouse. The New York strip is the bigger cut on the right. If you look at the steak the pieces at the tip are more cooked then the pieces that are closer to the bone, that's why I like this cut for my wife and I, we can each take the pieces that we like. I didn't make this steak but the classic way is kosher salt and pepper on a hot grill over high heat for 3 to 5 minutes until a nice crust forms, flip with tongs and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or longer if you want it done more. let sit to allow the juices to redistribute and cut and serve. 









 Like everyone else, salt and pepper, dry mustard is also good or a little Old Bay Seasoning is another favorite. I also like to use the package of mixed cheese ends that you can find in most stores and deli's, they usually have a mix of american, cheddar, swiss, pepper jack and others. Make a roux, add the cubed cheeses and stir until combined, always works for me.

 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4917517 and I say fake because these books were chosen for their color and height and because of the hanging pictures you can't even get to half of them. That's why I say fake because these books will never be read and I think that's really sad.

 Just made a basic recipe with what I had in the fridge, Made a large pot of mashed potatoes with butter, salt and milk and set aside. I then sauteed some mushrooms, carrots, onions and a left over small head of broccoli with butter. Then added half a box of beef stock and three tbls of Oyster Sauce, added the leftover meat and let that reduce for a couple of minutes then poured everything into a large baking dish, covered with the mashed potatoes, dotted with butter and baked off in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes then finished for 10 minutes at 400, remove and let cool before serving. I really don't know why I didn't take pics during the making of the slow cooker pulled pork or the shepards pie. I made this ramen with the leftover pepperoni ham and cheese stuffed pork chops from my superbowl dinner http://imgur.com/a/8cdy8 




 Sweet! I made a shepards pie with my pulled pork leftovers the other day. I just love getting a few meals from one dinner, don't you? 




 Yea, I think you just need another egg. Biscotti can take a lot of abuse like albino-rhino said. It's a very forgiving cookie to practice on if you don't have a lot of experience. I would invest in a mixer, it would be entirely worth it. Check out your local estate sales, look at the pics and see if there are any mixers available. I check mine all the time for sales and stuff.  














 I know the Safe and the Fappenning were very popular posts but one of the ones I keep thinking about is the one where a woman redditer posts a spread sheet of the non sex and her reasons for refusing her husband sent her just before she went on a 10 day business trip. http://www.reddit.com/user/throwwwwaway29 I wonder what has happened since? 




 Which post has left you wondering, what was the story behind it and what happened after? 




 Nice pic! Thanks. Why not post to /r/nycfood and or /r/Brooklyn  




 One opened at 68 street at the corner at the Alpine Movie theater (which I can't believe is still open!) and became a doughnut shop, there was another across from the theater and is now an Arabic store. One foolishly opened up right across the street from them and is now a Halal place and one opened up between Ovington and 72street and lasted about 6 months. Gino's has the banks and all the doctors offices on 75, Originals has the subway and the kids from the High school on 67. 









 Try the squares at Elegante's and then decide. Original is ok pizza. 




 Thrifted the first William Zinsser book a while ago and just got to it. It was a nice read and was looking into getting his popular On Writing Well and was going to order a Kindle Edition for $8.50 and decided for no particular reason and found it later in the day and I'm sure it was NOT there yesterday! :) 









 I picked up Writing Places by William Zinsser because it looked interesting on a thrift store visit a few weeks ago and just got to it. It was a good read and I looked into finding his On Writing Well which seems to be very popular so I was going to order a Kindle edition for $8.50 but thought i would wait a bit for no particular reason. I went to my thrift store again even though I was there yesterday and lo and behold his book was on a shelf! It was NOT there the day before. SWEET! It's not an updated edition but still very readable. 









 If you can try Elegante Pizza on 5th Av bt 69 street and Ovington in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. This family has been making great pizza since the late 70's. The best squares in the state. Just good pizza, so good I know for a fact that they have closed down 4 pizzerias who were foolish enough to open within a block of them and they are the last to raise their prices. Nothing but good pizza.

 There's a guy on Tiny House Swoon (I think) who is building a home in a container on the back of an 18 wheeler and of course you know about this guy http://lifestyle.boredombash.com/man-converts-truck-into-home/ right?

 No, but it'll start charging more. It's the same with Katz, they don't make their own pastrami and soon it'll be $20 bucks or more for a sandwich. :( 




 Your absolutely correct! With so much info on reddit, pinterest and other online sources it's almost criminal what there are doing. There are so many DIY projects and so many cheap ways to create power I have no idea where these people minds are at. Again it's fine if it was just them as a couple but to subject their kids to such extremes I think it's shameful.

 I think they get searched before they go in? 




 /r/crazystairs if you please! 




 Read a recipe through at least 3 times before you even begin to assemble the misc en place. 




 A program, an app or a disk that someone can use to clean a computer to when it was factory brand new? 




 Oswald was a patsy, he actually tried to save Kennedy by warning the FBI but was ignored. 





























 I agree, but bringing little kids into the woods with no electricity? No lights other than candles when it gets pitch black at night? The guy's got no family, friends to help him build the dam house? He HAS to do it himself? As a couple ok but to be with NO communications? What happens if one of the kids fall and hurt themselves? Wait for the father to come back and walk/carry the kid to town? Crazy. 




 Maybe they should have built the house first and of course the kids are going to be at each other, what else do they have to do? 




 WOW! Incredible, thanks.
