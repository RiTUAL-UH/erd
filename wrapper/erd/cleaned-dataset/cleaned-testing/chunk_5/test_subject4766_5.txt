 Well at least he made his point.  



















 I think it's SHIELD 2.0 I think some agents from Agents of Shield may cameo at the end as well. Who else are they gonna get to run it? Would be awesome if Coulson returned for a cameo as well.  









 Good lord. That cpu cooler.  




 some people don't have room for a desktop and a desktop doesn't have the portability of a laptop.  




 can you post the temps in Celsius please? I hate trying to read temps in Fahrenheit. 









 That's what I mean. With Civil War marvel has now dug themselves into a hole they cant get out of. Now in future solo movies they'll have to come up with some crap excuse as to why Cap cant help out Black Panther or something because after Civil War fans will be questioning these things more and more.  




 After civil war everyone is going to be asking why Iron Man isn't in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or why Captain America isn't in Thor Ragnarok. I think marvel have created an in inescapable situation here with civil war where they have essentially killed their own solo films by making civil war basically avengers 2.5 and now all the fans will be wondering why certain characters wont be in other characters solo films. Is the age of the solo film done? 




 FlashForward. That cliffhanger had me in tears. still pissed they canceled it.  



















 One weeks not so bad I guess. Hopefully they do it soon and get it out of the way.  




 Anyone know if there will be any more 2 week breaks or will it be a straight run to the season finale from here? 





























 Just had a look on the receipt and I don't see anything. 




 I bought a 970 last week. How do I get my free copy of the witcher 3? 




 is it even on netflix anymore? according to https://netflixaroundtheworld.com/ its not.  




 Just curious.  














 Great. Just what we need more movies about American patriotism. Look don't get me wrong I enjoyed American Sniper but why does everyone have to jump on a bandwagon.  
























 Beautiful.  




 Maybe hes adding a bit of spider-man to it? 



















 yea by 1%  





































































 its like marvel cant seem to make up their mind how much of this movie is officially canon. They have referenced it since its release but when ever marvel talks about is past It always feels like the incredible hulk gets pushed to the side. What does r/movies think? is the incredible hulk canon in the MCU despite marvel kind of acknowleding it.  














 Any chance it will be with inside out? 














 For a second there I thought Sky was gonna leave Shield. I mean they set it up perfectly if they wanted to go down that route.  




 OP doesn't know how to enjoy movies.  




 Nightcrawler, end of watch 



















 Its really annoying since its stops other games showing as being in game.  




 Figured it out. just took a bit of tinkering in EVGA precision. got my fans at 30% and the 970 is now sitting at a nice 37C.  




 hmm if you say so. its just compared to my old gtx 660 which would sit at around 40c while browsing with the fans on this is quite hot in my books. I guess I'm just not used to the new 900 series cards and how they work.  




 yea but right now im using chrome watching a 1080p movie trailer and its sitting at 49c. seems a bit hot.  




 How do I get the fans to run? I know they don't start running till about 60c on the EVGA ACX 2.0 model. I tried playing around with precision x but its kinda confusing. I want my fans to run at a low speed 24/7. Is this possible? 




 AMC movie talk.  




 So much this! I wish the larger fan base would hurry up and figure this out. It was never about the cars or the action it was always about family.  









 No offence but you just wasted your money.  









 By this time last year we already had confirmation of season 3. But yet this year we have no word on season 4. Any ideas when we might get a confirmation? 




 Pretty high I reckon. Unless they replace him with a new character to fill his spot.  




 I was thinking Thanos needs an army right? what if he summons all the villains in the MCU to team up with him to fight the avengers. This could be anyone from Abomination to Red Skull.  Who would you have on team Thanos if this were to happen?

 




 This might be the best city builder since Sim City 4 imo. I'm having fun just watching streams. The gameplay looks incredibly engading and addicting and it looks like its got some real depth to it. Can it be Tuesday already? :D 




 In regards to Thor I was talking about Malekith. 




 It seems like Loki is the only villain marvel have seem to have gotten right in the MCU. Bucky was also a pretty decent villain in TWS so marvel do seem to be learning and hopefully they'll knock it out of the park with Ultron. But it seems like with Thor and Iron Man they struggle a lot to make engaging and interesting villains. Why is that? Are their writers just having trouble grasping the source material or are they just surrounded by yes men who have no idea wtf they're doing? 




 Cause too much water, am i rite? 




 I know that. Why do you think I'm going for the 970 . 




 Exactly.Plus I don't have $1000 to spend.  




 980s are over a $1000 here in NZ.  




 http://www.pbtech.co.nz/index.php?z=p p=VGAEVG2972 name=EVGA-GeForce-GTX970-4GB-ACX-Dual-Fan-PCI-E-3.0-Vid 




 May have the opportunity to pick one up on Tuesday. A local computer store is having a sale on 970's and its within my budget so I'm thinking of getting one. I play at 1080p so I just wanted to double check that I wont be affected by the 970 memory issues.  




 yep. And its actually a decent port.  




 I ended up torrenting it haha.  




 the torrent has leaked go try it out yourself.  




 Actually Carrie not be an intelligence officer again does kind of make sense after what happend at the end of season 4.  









 Not gonna happen for me. I'm addicted to trailers.  




 da faq. 2.5 years? so what does that mean for Quinn?  




 your not a pirate. Your just changing region. Everybody does it. lol.  




 I went to Netflix last night to watch the avengers but found out for some reason its gone and after a bit of searching I found out it left Netflix back in December. They really need to bring back expiration dates on the app itself so people know. I know we have great posters here who let us know what movies are available on VOD services each week but there needs to be something that lets us know when movies are leaving Netflix. 














 whats it like? its optimized well? 









 The OP deleted it as soon as it was announced he was ok he felt his title was mis leading once the news he was ok came out.  




 Honestly I think the podcast is better without him. I find he just yells out a bunch of random crap and I have no interest in any of his opinions but thats just me. I've also noticed that when Jesse is on TB seems to take the backseat a bit more and lets everyone else speak  but this week TB seemed to be quite happy without Jesse.  




 Yea of course.I don't care what people say I'm not gonna get rid of my Xbox one and Ps4.  














 So whats happening with the sequel? Do we know for sure that its in development? I remember reading that the sequel is expected in 2016 and that Aiden might not be the main protagonist.  









 I Amazing Spider-Man 2'd myed self. No regrets. The trailers saved me from going to the movie. so top kek to sony for that one.  









 Think for a moment about ghosts. There are two proposed types: intelligent ghosts, and memories. Then, there are time travelers, something that seems unrelated at first thought.

Intelligent ghosts are the type you can interact with, and can interact with you. Some consider them to be dangerous, and others think them friendly.

Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a childs laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.

A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well? 



















 By the time May comes around BvS will be less than 12 months out.Which is still quite early for a teaser. Trailers don't usually start releasing till about 6 months out. A few movies being the exception like Interstellar with a teaser trailer one year out.  




 This is still not enough to make me switch. I use windows as my daily driver for work so I cant really switch to Linux even if I wanted to. I wouldn't switch to it on my desktop or laptop at home ether.  




 I always assumed it was bitch? 









 MTV and Awards used in the same sentence. LMAO. what a joke.  














 Nek minute... 









 I thought I read some where that hes supposed to have a cameo along with Heimdall. yea here it is. http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/idris-elba-says-heimdall-and-loki-are-in-age-of-ultron-calls-going-from-mandela-to-thor-2-torture 









 I know that. I'm asking what is stark going to do with the scepter.  









 Wonder what this means for his Alien movie? Would contracts have been signed at this stage so the studio is obligated to let him make it or could they still cancel the project? 




 20% on rotten tomatoes, 5 reviews only 1 is positive. I know its still too early to call it but its not looking good.  




 This looks really good. Ian McKellen is gonna make a great Mr Holmes.  









 I remember reading some where about Zoe returning in a flash back or something. I guess it was just a bs rumor.  




 the star wars prequels. The internet forgets that there is an entire generation of people that actually like those movies and probably dont say anything when their favorite movies get hated on.  




 they had reshoots planned for January-Febuary so its not to far fetched to think they coud of used that time to put something together.  














 anyone got one last guess as to what they might announce? 




 hes on drugs. I mean look at his eyes he looks like hes 420 blazing it. 

http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/01/a-hulk-117758.jpg 




 I've only seen him in House of Cards. Any movies of his I should check out? 









 well if spider-man isn't in Civil War after this then something went seriously wrong. He should have more than a cameo if they are signing a deal with the directors of Civil War.  
























 "Make it better" he said lol  




 Since we know Ahsoka is alive. Where was she during revenge of the sith?  









 First couple of tv spots are already out.  









 That was a dick move on his part. He should of just done it and not drag it out, he basically tortured the poor girl. I guess they wanted to show how far Doug had fallen and how loyal he his to Frank. Still pissed me of though.  




 Not sure if its just me but games have a been pretty shit recently. just wondering what everyone is playing? 




 But I liked clones :( 




 that would be weird but a nice surprise none the less. Maybe strange uses some alternate dimension thing to bring spider-man into the MCU? 




 Its not official, but they have been right about stuff before. They called the marvel and sony spider-man deal months before it was announced.  














 When you realize you only have one episode left before you have to wait another year :( 









 Inception 









 RDJ is more likely to announce the new actor playing spider-man rather than the director of the new movie. Spider-Man will replace Iron Man as the face of the MCU come phase 4 it would only make sense that RDJ announce his replacement.  














 Paid sex is best sex.  



















 Take a break! seriously people take your 15 min break or however long you get! Get some fresh air or get something to eat. Do something just get out of that chair and put that headset down every chance you get otherwise you will go insane.  









 In Soviet Russia we be friend you.  




 Any news on when Wii U emulation might become a thing? 









 Totally agree! I fuckin loved whiplash. I would of been happy if ether American Sniper or Whiplash won over Birdman.  




 I thought American Sniper was a much better movie than Birdman. Birdman is just overly long, boring and tedious outside of Michael Keatons performance it just didnt do anything for me.  









 You guys are lucky. Back when I was younger. It took up to a year for a movie a movie to hit vhs and dvd. Now it only takes 3-4 months. For bluray and VOD. 









 Man remember when everyone thought this was for the halo movie? good times.  




 FYI. Its not my poster.  









 Thanks. I knew he slipped in the bath tub but I didn't see the lump on his arm. I was watching it pretty late so I guess  I didn't see it.  




 Since the first film took place in 2019. Would be a nice little nod to the first film.  




 Use Hola extension and change region to US.  




 Anyone care to explain this? I was a bit lost 









 Just wanted to double check here first, does the standard $7.99 sub include HD or is HD only included with the 2 screens + HD sub for $8.99?  









 Being in NZ we are a full day a head of America. So I have to wait till saturday.  the pain is real.  









 I'm a big gamer, I love all platforms but nintendo has never really done anything for me outside of Pokemon.So its weird that I've been considering picking up a Wii U but I'm not even sure why I want one. Are there any MUST have Wii U exclusives? I guess I do want to play Mario Kart 8 and theres always the off chance nintendo brings out a pokemon colosseum like game for the Wii U sometime in the future. But beyond that I just dont know really.  



















 Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War calling it now.  



















 Back when infinity war was announced their was a bit of debate whether or not infinity war was one movie just split into two or if it counted as avengers 3 and 4. Anyone know if we ever got an answer? 









 I was excited for the mods and to see what the pc community would bring to the table but Ive already played it on ps4 and now after this 3rd delay any I had for the pc version died with it.
