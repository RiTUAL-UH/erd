I'm currently working on my first big game on the PS Vita (Keeping it private until I have something pretty to show... which is looking like it'l lbe in the next two weeks or so!)  I also do miscellaneous dev stuff, like helping with some 3DS homebrew stuff, running a C++ game development Twitch Stream, game jams (when time permits), and more.  Working to use Twitter more so recently, though I just want to Tweet about stuff that matters, cause I don't think people would find my ever day thoughts as fun lol That said, once my game is public, expect lot's of Tweets as I work on development more :) 




 Pretty sure that's the "YOU STOLE MY T.A.R.D.I.S.!" expression lol 




 Gonna call it now, he's a Terminator. 

And I kind of like the idea of that lol 









 All of my brothers friends, who are 6-10 years younger than me, are now either 6ft tall, getting their drivers, or going to college soon.
