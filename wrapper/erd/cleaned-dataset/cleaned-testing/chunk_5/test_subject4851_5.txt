 You will find examples even on this thread. The Philippines and Japan come to mind. 




 :) You get bored writing and reading. And sometimes Reddit doesn't cut it. You'd be amazed at how far behind society is from current research. 




 Hint: look harder. Try looking for published research articles and not some oped 




 This had me falling off my seat!! That final pic, w.o.w.
 




 Sounds like the beach party was a 'farewell' to all her friends.
You should probably 'write' here a letter. 




 I think there's a double misunderstanding here. I assumed you were referring to the women/men finding what is rare attractive. This was my mistake as I combined your comment with someone else's. I meant that finding the 'rare' exotic and attractive is natural.

Considering women/men prey is lame with or without the mileage. But I wouldn't fault anyone for traveling far and wide to find 'love'. 




 It does. 




 You have very penetrating eyes. Pretty cool. 




 This is humbling to read. Sometimes you come across stories and experiences that remind you of just how little you 'know' about life. Thank you for sharing. 
Things like this will be helpful to know as a parent raising a female child. Not so much to protect but to be of some sensible support and compass through it all. 




 Hugs bro! 




 Nah. The male equivalent of the 'B' word. The 'stupid', i think is the equivalent of the dumb jock. No? 




 People will surprise you in a positive and negative way. I think your story is refreshing and adds to the convo.
 




 Actually it is not. It is completely natural. 




 You clearly haven't been out much.
Actually, and this is backed by many published research findings, the most highly rated male is the black male. (Asian rank number one in the female category).
Being scary is a stereo type that doesn't hold true everywhere, not even everywhere in America. Please quite with the self loathing already. 




 Haaaahahhaa! 




 This is what the video camera on your phone is meant for. :/ 




 This right here is accurate to the minute. I know, I timed it quite a few times. 




 Oh I'm not just referring to polygamy. I meant to apply the question to all marriage. 
And to be honest, beyond playing advocate and outside of the marriage debate, time to maturity has reduced I think. At least physically if not mentally.  




 I understand and agree. But who is to decide what the cut off should be and why? Not meaning you should answer, its 'food for thought.' 




 "You aren't born a polygamist. "
This is scientifically unfounded hearsay. There is actually much more evidence supporting this (statistically) than being inclined to homosexual behavior.  




 Why are you discriminating against people under 18. 
To play devils advocate here, what magically happens on the eve of the 18th birthday  that 'changes everything' and makes it okay? It is a completely arbitrary age and is only a matter of time before this too is changed. 
And 'you' having or not having a 'problem with this' is not a legal argument either. 




 Been there. Understand and appreciate your being candid.
My initial comment was a FTFY. Well, one way of looking at it is that we both agree the current 'trend' is broken since, in a healthy society, we should be appalled by any acts of cruelty and senseless violence towards any living creature. 
That the media pushes this or that idea is one thing. This however, is reddit. "We" shape the conversation as it should be. 
  




 I thought we all were. This is reddit! Every one is here because we all know and are tired of the very fact we are discussing. Yet you want to propagate it. How is that making things better?  




 Evidence suggests that it will. Does not mean that it should...  




 Stop retweeting it. You encourage it.  




 If the story about him getting divorced and losing everything were true then you have to wonder how broken our legal system is. Please Emit how it makes sense to lose a SO and all of your material wealth, for whatever reasons, is just?  




 Imagine the uproar if there was no footage. Holy shit. 

FTFY
 




 Why not just read them as actual words to avoid being confused. I never say 'i' 'e' when i type or write, i actually say 'that' 'is'.
 




 Under the letter of the law, they probably won't be held in contempt. Any reasonable judge should enforce in favor of the SCOTUS ruling. 




 Hawk eye here. AMA. 




 The power of reddit. Sounds like a He-man esq thing 




 It isn't collective shame, it is collective guilt. 




 It's an idiomatic expression in the English language. Used in a situation where there is a danger of eliminating something good or precious (baby) when we are hyper focused on eliminating something bad or useless (dirty bath water) .  




 I think /r/ManWhoSmokes was being sarcastic. 




 Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this thread. I feel that these stories need to be told. The naked truth about the ills, which we as human beings were capable of inflicting upon one another, need to be reechoed.  




 y -_- 




 A reason to doubly evaluate and re-evaluate every step, every conviction we hold. I think never being absolute about any and everything except the sun rise and sun set is a sure way to avoid falling into such deeply misguided atrocities.
