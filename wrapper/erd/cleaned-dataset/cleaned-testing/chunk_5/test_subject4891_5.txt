 When I right click, it selects each of my objects. I can't move them anywhere unless I want to move all of them. 




 I suck at character modeling. How did you get good at it? 




 Blender kicks ass at creating stuff like planes and materials. But sucks at character creation. 




   If we had a good list of links, it would be good for new users like myself. 









 I'm using AE, blender, and maya. And I don't feel like cycling through softwares. I was impressed by element 3d.  




 Great man. Thanks 




 Just wondering. I need a renderer. 




 Usertesting is pretty good. $10-15 per test. 




  Also, what other sites could I use? 




   I saw someone who did a speed modeling video where a guy modeled a gun based of an image which he had in the background really fast. He could chose a polygon and stretch it out in less than that of a second. I'm thinking he just uses keyboard shortcuts, for that's what people do in Blender speed modeling videos. So, what keyboard shortcuts do I use to do such? 




   Can I just import my models into renderman and then use muh shaders to render it out? 




 Alright. So how do you do the "sped modeling" thing? Where one is able to stretch and select polygons very fast in blender or Maya? Do you just use the keyboard? 




   I saw a video where a guy created a 3d model off of an image? How does he bring the image in? How does he change the size and select shapes of polygons so fast? A simple explanation would be great? 




   I want my reader to feel sadness and anger. But I feel like killing characters to often becomes cliched and gimmicky. What are some tips, r/ writing? 









     I've worked on a few vidya games which was pretty cool, but I was completely sapped of creativity. We used CryEngine, and I realized how similar it looked to CGI movie effects. I started comparing films to video games.
   I asked myself, "How can a film be more interesting than a video game if a video game is so interactive and keeps the player on the edge of their seat?"
     Anyway, long story short, what are some nifty writing and editing tricks to keep the film vibrant, exciting, and interesting? 









   I was thinking Christians would feel good because you know, your hurting Satan, the ultimate sinner. Yet games such as the Diablo trilogy and Darksiders have created controversy. 




 Looking for a place to download the engine used in Quake. I'm designing a retro game. 




 Does anyone know where I can download the engine used in Quake 1? 
I think it's id tech 2 or something. Anyway, I'm making a retro game, so if y'all could help me find this engine, that would be great. 




   One side of the planet would always have day light, another would always have constant darkness. 




 Okay? Where do I start? Where do I begin making an agreement with Nintendo?
Also, do you have to own a company to become a dev? 




    I think R/ Nintendo would know better than anyone else. 
I know you need to have an agreement with Nintendo, so where do I start?
 How do I acquire a devkit? How do I publish my game for the Wii U?

  Seriously. They're releasing two games in 2015. I'm worried for CryEngine.  




 Voxel farm is a Voxel engine. You make shit out of billions of tiny voxels. The more voxels, the better and more round a model can be. This is supposed to solve the problem of games not being able to render enough polygons. 
  With voxels, you can have unlimited detail, and according to Euclidean, not have to worry about hardware specs.
   So I'm trying to find an equally good Voxel engine without jew prices.

  I'm a cryengine dev, and I want to know if my tech works with Wii U. 









   Seriously. Valve doesn't know what the consumer wants. We have our standards too high. If Half-Life 3 came out, what would you want? 









   I haven't seen any good one in a while. Working on a film and need some good footage for inspiration, btw. 




 I have a quiz tommorow and I'm having much difficulty. 









 Oh! Never thought of that. Thanks for the advice!

   Do we think they will release a free non-commercial version of it, just like Pixar did with Renderman?
