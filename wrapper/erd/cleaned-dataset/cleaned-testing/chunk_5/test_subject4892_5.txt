 Has a team (other than us) ever been ranked 6th in both human polls and unranked in two computer polls this late in the season? Ridiculous. 




 How has Clemson underperformed? they're 9-1 and their only loss was to us. But VT, yeah, no argument there. 




 INORITE?

 *2-2, against the #4 team in the nation. Nice try though. 




 There are a couple that I think would be awesome to be a part of; but because I can't see who's modding it I don't know how to request admission. Is there a way to somehow do that, or am I SOL? 




 You think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's best film? 




 This is really sad and awful. How often do ambulances come on to the field? 




 9 tackles for loss on 12 run plays so far. 

Bad feeling: has. 




 FSU starting niiiice and slooooow. I'm not okay with this inside Lane Stadium on a Thursday night. 




 EJ may have underthrown both bombs so far, but to be fair, he was in the process of being tackled during both throws. 




 VT fumbles hand off. Still gets first down. Behold the power of Lane Stadium. 




 Highest rated kicker in this years class. I don't see it happening. It's okay though, we have another awesome kicker waiting in the wings. 




 When was Varajao ever selected as an all-star while he was on the team with Lebron? 




 That last outfit; do you have any idea where the parts are from? I love it to death. 




 Yep. Sexual assault =/= assault. Not to mention a lot of jurisdictions have blended the two torts together anyways so assault could have been a valid here absent the sexual nature of the offense; even though the whole point is moot because it's all American law and they're not in America. Not to mention we're all talking in colloquial definitions and not strict legal ones anyways. 




 1984 at number one made me skeptical, Lord Of the rings at #2 made me very skeptical, then I saw the hunger games and stopped taking it seriously. Then I realized 50 shades of grey was ranked above Madam Bovary and I stopped considering it a list. 




 ITT: we're getting downvoted by angry Lakers fans. 




 All of this plus one little thing- that knot looks bad because it's so small. Try going for a full windsor. 




 I'd just like to point out right now that our 7 man rotation currently comprises four shooting guards and three power forwards. 




 Hrmmm. You win this one. 




 That's one of the least specific majors you can possibly get. 




 Notice how I didn't compare them to FSU in any way, shape, or form? 




 Still. They've played 3 teams this season with winning records, and lost all 3 of those games. 




 Me too. But I still understand what a joke is. 




 I love Pale Fire, and I think that's amazing. I'm honestly shocked Lolita isn't higher up in this thread though. 




 As an FSU grad who grew up in Orlando, this man would bring more happiness to me than you can imagine. 




 Excellent. Thank you. 




 Is there any chance you have the screenshot + beaker background? 




 Meh. The Vegas over/under on their season after Harden is like 35 wins. They're up with Minnesota/Dallas on that "punchers chance for the 8th seed" level right now. 




 And even if it's acceptable, it looks bad. 




 You learned this from Mad Men. Be honest. 




 Who's projecting us to lose to Florida again? 




 To be fair. That sounds like one of the most logical reasons possible for a man to want to commit suicide.

"I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison *and* my family is going to die poor *or* I can commit suicide and they'll at least be well provided for. 




 I basically pulled all the probabilities out of my ass. 




 Do you know that, with Jonas Jerebko, Monroe, and Villanueva, he'll get 30 minutes a game? Something rookies *rarely* get, especially ones that are as raw as he is. 




 *classic* ACC style football. 




 I just did a rough calculation of our BCS title game chances. Assuming  
1) Alabama wins out, including UGA in the SECCG (%75)  
2) We win out (~60%)  
3) no team behind us is going to jump us  
4) KSU, ND, and Oregon need two losses for us to jump them.  
5) we pass USCe after our win over florida + ACC championship game

There is like a 10% chance KSU gets at least two losses and a 15% chance Oregon gets at least two losses. There's about a 12.5% chance that ND loses two more times.

If we assume (incorrectly) that all of these are independent probabilities, that puts our title chances at .75 x .6 x .1 x .15 x .125 = .085% and that's being very optimistic


:( 




 Heh, I didn't say it. I'll be rooting for you guys, the enemy of my enemy is my bro.  




 This is one of those "it's so far fetched you shouldn't even feel offended" scenarios. 




 Sagarin's overall rankings are made up of two formulas. ELO_Chess only takes into account who you've beaten and who you've lost to without regard to by how much. Then Predictor, which only takes into account margin of victory and completely disregards whether you've won or lost. The two are averaged out somehow, and comes up with his ranking, which is still a bit quirky, but pretty good for a computer. 

The BCS decided to only use the ELO_CHESS portion of his formula for their computer ranking. I don't know the reason, I think the idea *might* be to correct for the amount of human bias pollsters can put into their rankings or something. It's a very weird decision though, IMO. 




 I know, I was playing along. 




 Or Kansas State winning out. 




 Be honest though, how far down the list did you really look? 




 And when you beat South Carolina and we beat UF that will eliminate a bunch more :D 




 It should also be noted that computers completely disregard MOV (I think, if they do, then it is to a negligible amount). So for instance, Texas moved up on you guys this week, because Kansas is rated higher generally in computer polls than Colorado is. 




 Computers don't GAF about margin of victory though. 




 The fact that they are still only using Sagarin's ELO_CHESS computer has been, and always will be, goddamn retarded. 

His rankings in *Week 9* when computers are supposed to actually start making sense.

1. KSU  
2. Notre Dame  
3. Florida  
4. LSU
5. Oklahoma  
6. UGA
7. Alabama  
8. Oregon  
9. South Carolina  
10. TTU  
11. Oregon State  
12. Stanford  
13. WVU  
14. Arizona  
15. TAMU  
16. Texas
17. Washington   
18. USC
19. Nebraska
20. Iowa State  
21. Miss. State.  
22. Oklahoma State
23. Michigan  
24. Louisville  
25. UCLA  

With Florida State, Clemson, Boise State, and Louisiana Tech unranked.  




 South Carolina in 8th is hilarious. Other than that, no real complaints. 




 Dude, bleacherreport. That simulation has us behind UF in both human polls, but we're in front of them in both human polls. 




 TBH I am confused to. I don't think anyone knows for sure exactly what happened (i.e. Dwight may have said he would refuse to resign with the Rockets which was a condition of their offer, maybe our front office hated the idea of having Brooks Lopez's max contract on the books and making us better enough to hurt our rebuilding draft chances). Ultimately I am confuse as well. 




 Uhh, we resigned Jameer because we needed a starting PG, and with JRich and Dwight gone we're not worried about cap space, and they're both still serviceable players. There is nothing wrong with letting them both play out there contracts while we start acquiring young talent. 




 Then... why are you posting this in the coaches poll thread? 




 Wait. Where are you seeing these BCS rankings? 




 Right. Bounces = fumbles lost v. fumbles recovered. 




 We are the tattoos worth it? 




 Rob Hennigan wasn't involved in the trade, it was executed by the Magic's CEO/President. Also, lol at linking to the bleacherreport as proof of anything ever. 




 Nobody seems to be mentioning it, but this isn't surprising at all, nor does it mean the Thunder are losing him. It's part of the negotiation and the Thunder are probably going to up the salary + other incentives that don't count against the cap (i.e. bonuses for making all-star team, making the finals, winning 6th man again etc.), which is exactly what they did for Ibaka. 




 and they would all suck from the comparative lack of activity. 




 gyro? 




 Jeff Driskel??

He's averaging 132 passing yards and 1.14 touchdowns a game. 




 I think he's surprised they're still so high. 




 Typing this from a phone so forgive the errors and brevity-

I love this film because there's a perspective here that a lot of people seemed to miss: I see this story as told *through the lense* of the main character, a 9 year okd boy scout.

Think about the characters. The girl's parents are lawyers, so what do they do lying in bed? They talk about boring adult lawyer things. Edward Norton is shown as having an immensly crisp routine as scoutmaster, because a young boyscout would see his scoutmaster as being comparatively a robot. Notice how resourveful he is when they're travelling through the woods? He likes to see himself as a person caoable of surviving in the woods, and her as some silly girl who doesn't now how to pack or prepare for real wilderness. Notice how 'social services' is represented by a cold, mean old lady? That's exactly the kind of personification a 9 year old would have of a social services worker. Notice how innocuous the afair was represented? It's because that's what having affair is to him.

I see this not as an objective story with a caraciturized cast, but as a story told through the imaginative mind of a young boy. 




 wat 




 I'm struggling because on one hand this really isn't the spirit of truereddit; but that was a goddamn excellent relevant lyric. 




 This article was, as a whole, quite sloppy. The comparisons to Venice  were very weak as well.  




 Just out of curiosity, why? He's an incredibly talented "game managing" quarterback for a conservative play-calling offense. He's not a Geno Smith hand-cannon by any means, but he's a very solid decision maker. 




 Ha, okay. I guess you clearly have a well-painted picture of how good FSU is in your head already so I won't argue with you anymore. See you Nov. 24th. 




 Sure.

We're 6-1 with our only loss coming by one point on the road to a team who's 4-2 right now. We've beaten a team that's currently ranked (13th USA, 14th AP).

We have the 6th best scoring offense in the nation, (you can point to the fact that we've played two AA teams this year, but I'd rebut by saying one of them ended with 20 minutes left so it someone mitigates stat-inflating). We're ranked 12th in the nation in total offense (23rd passing, 16th rushing; so incredibly well balanced). Also our quarterback is currently ranked 4th in the nation in passing efficiency. 

We have the 4th best total scoring defense in the nation, allowing 11.6points/game. We're ranked 3rd in the nation in total defense; including being 5th overall in rushing defense and 3rd in passing efficiency defense. 

Our strength of schedule isn't great, sure, but it's not awful either. I'd say collectively that's a resume of a top-25 team at least. 




 Yeah; because ignoring margin of victory is **so** logical. And "we were supposed to be really good" is clearly the only argument Clemson and FSU have for being ranked in the top-25. 




 Both ACC teams received perfect .000% in the computer polls. I fucking hate the computer polls. 




 Yeah, I was looking at the AP, ah well. 




 FUCK. 




 I wanted us to move up though :( 




 NERLENS NOEL aka Dwight 2.0 aka Shaq 3.0

*the cycle continues* 




 Okay... fair. He gets no love from FM/AM though. I heard Lay Lady Lay on a country station about two weeks ago and it blew my mind, it was I think the first time I had ever heard him on air. 




 I absolutely love tax law and I'm so glad I don't have this problem. 




 Dylan definitely does not get a lot of radio play.

/someone who listens to lots of radio and is an avid Dylan fanatic. 




 So if you've determined that the anecdote had nothing to do with this thread... why did you post it? 




 That's *really* stretching 'stacked' territory. We have the quantity, we're lacking in actual quality. 




 No way on earth Magic get to 35 wins this year. 




 I've just started studying for the REG portion of the CPA, my first section. I've never filled out a tax form before, I don't know how to use excel very well, and I the Wiley book I'm reading from doesn't give me much help in the way of how to perform a search SIM.

What are the best ways to prepare for the REG exam in these areas? 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71wCKbjU8Q 




 Just out of curiosity, does anyone know generally how often callbacks lead to offers with the big-4? Or maybe any sort of literature on the subject itself? 




 Isn't it still going to be used to determine the who goes to the playoff? Or am I way wrong here. 




 Yep. Would not recommend pulling the trigger on anything like these. 




 1. Your one loss is no longer to a top-3 team

2. It took really really late in the game to pull away from GT; a very bad GT. 




 Except he completely missed Final Fantasy IV, VI, IX and X; all of which are considered to be 'classics' 




 Nice sloooow starts, all around. 




 no! 




 Clemson, come on! You are our one claim to legitimacy right now. You **CANNOT** lose this game. 




 Given the hours and pay of the legal profession, especially for younger lawyers (and excluding biglaw about the pay part), you really have to love it or it will eat you. 




 At the high school level... 

1) there are so many things so absurdly more important than Wickard for a government class; to spend 3% of the entire school year on it is a horrendous misappropriation of time

2) like you said, I doubt it's even on the radar for the AP U.S. history exam

3) Inasmuch as a high schooler who's just now learning about the governent is concerned; there is probably about 10-15 minutes worth of good substantive teaching that they could understand about it. 




 There's a very good argument that Miranda rights are prophylactic anyways. 




 Spending a week on Wickard in high school would make his class one of the worst AP high school classes in existence. 




 But then he would only win it like 40% of the time, which gives brings the expected payout of his scheme over time down to $200 per trial; which means that in the long run he only makes like 200 bucks doing this. 




 fffffffuuuuuuuu 




 I have a couple of interviews coming up this week with the big 4, and I really don't have much of an idea how to research pertinent information on a firm. I'm specifically interviewing for tax positions, and so I'd like to be able to bring up relevant facts and/or recent accomplishments.

Can someone point me in the right direction? 




 Awesome. Thanks! 




 Just about all the scores are messed up. It says FSU is 3-0 when they're 5-0. 




 Is that an ESPN manufactured controversy I hear brewing? 




 Is he the same guy that made a post consisting of nothing all his shoes and shoe-cleaning equipment, and announced that today he was going to be cleaning his giant collection of nice shoes?

If yes, all I have to say is this guy is way too proud of his curious life priorities. 




 Somewhat related- but one of the things that MFA seems lacking the most is good taste in ties. 




 That was fun while it lasted :/ 




 The name Jacksonville State gives me nightmares. Those were dark times. 




 Our lack of ability to play shut-down defense right now is really annoying. 




  I'm going to start wearing a mink fedora  

Oh god.
 I have to start dressing like an adult  

You're off on the wrong foot then
 my goal is to be as sharp as possible  

The really really wrong foot
 while never having anyone look at me thinking "what's going on with that guy's outfit?"  

Troll confirmed
