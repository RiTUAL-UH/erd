 yes, I enjoy this sort of thing as well even if I did leave the Church at 15. One of my favourites was the treasury of St. Marks in Venice. Incredibly rich, and it's interesting to contemplate that almost every object was acquired by theft. 









 I know there is a lot of tax-dodging, and many workers, especially migrant workers from the countryside, are employed in the black market. Where do the foreigners come into this ? Obviously there is something that I am in ignorance of. What countries do these people come from ? What sort of industries do they work in ? How do they pull it off. It seems the government would be hot on the trail of the lost tax money. 














 Old news granted. One thing struck me however. I guess that there are foreigners working *outside* of factories in China. Aren't a lot of them employees of multinationals ? Ho does Chinese legislation apply to them ? 
























 I guess that might sound contradictory.  






















































 Great source. There is another subreddit, r/anarchisthistoryporn , that bears a look. It is, of course, far less extensive than the Labadie collection's is. 










































































 Interesting essay. It's been a long time since I've read anything by Mattick. Without addressing the full article I have some doubts about the first part. The author seems to conflate the private views of Marx and Engels ("Progressive and reactionary nations", etc.) with the views and actions of the socialist and anarchist movement as a whole. I don't think that pre-WW1 social democratic parties acted in a way consistent with the views of Marx and Engels. 














 I'm afraid not. I believe they are from France, but beyond that I am unsure. 


































 I wouldn't be able to comment on members of police forces. I am sure it varies from time to time and place to place. As to the military I don't think there is a great difference from the normal population in general terms in countries where there is conscription. In places where there are voluntary armies I'd suspect that the greatest incentive is socioeconomic. Good idea or not a lot of people think the military is a way to "better their condition". 





























 I can hope so, though the 'lead-on' from this sort of thing certainly hasn't given birth to any great wave of 'what next' in most leftist places. 




 I certainly hope to in the last 100 years. Gives a new meaning to 'stinky goche'. 











































































































































 I recently read this, and I'm curious as to what others think'. The authors' explanation in the article  seems 'fishy'. Ammonites were in decline for some time before the K/T boundary, and I pretty well certain that no fish has ever occupied an ecological niche once occupied by ammonites. I am also doubtful that there were enough marine reptiles to account for the freeing up of niches or reducing predation pressure on fish. As to the latter the loss of reptile predation should have removed a selective pressure and led to *decreased* speciation. Finally, why do shark species remain more or less stable ?

 



























































 In 'New York Times speak' it does, and so unfortunately it does in most public discourse in the USA. How 'class' is spoken about varies from country to country and even within countries themselves. I would personally prefer the term "working class". In speaking to the average person I would truncate that to "workers' especially in the USA. The way "middle class" is used in America is quite unique. It actually seems very 'Mom and apple pie' when it comes out of the mouth of a politician, and I think it is like the use of the word "family" in a lot of cases ie without much content. I'd never use the term myself, but I am very much of a minority in this matter.

So, I actually agree with you, but the NYT is the NYT. The way in which the term is used in the USA would sound very strange in say Britain. Over there the 'Middle Class' doesn't carry the positive associations it does in NA. It is often used to describe people who in other countries would be called 'capitalists'. 




 Thanks. I've never heard that expression before, but it is a good one. 









 I don't know. I understand he is a fairly good amateur pianist. Not musician grade for sure. He won't be following in the steps of Glen Gould anytime soon, but it's still an accomplishment that I find praiseworthy. That rules out "complete". 




 I had to pick some word for the title. "Chart" seemed appropriate though I'm sure there are other words that could be used, some of them better than the one I chose. 









 If it was North America I might quip that keeping up one's clothing styles and proper vegan diet requires a fairly significant cash flow. Different thing in Greece though.

If almost certainly wasn't planned, but I would say it would have been brilliant if it was. The police, of course, are already on the highest alert possible. Starting a rumor of anarchists attacking ATM would be a work of genius. The mind boggles at the number of police officers necessary to properly protect all the ATMs in a large city. 












































 There is a more extensive [history](http://libcom.org/history-black-guards) of this subject at Libcom. That history also mentions one of the weaknesses of the Black Guards, if only to note that the Red Guards contained similar criminal elements. It was the refusal of the anarchists to disavow this minority element that gave the Bolsheviks their 'cover' for the suppression.  






















































 I'd tend to agree with you. There is a great tendency to try and define as much of normal behavior as some sort of "pathology". It keeps a very large industry humming away, and big-Pharma that people try and blame is only a minor part of it. 

I guess we are about the same age. Both my parents have been dead for some years as well. Take care, and my sympathy about their bad attitude. 



















 Sorry I messed up the link to dpac' s website. It's been corrected. In any case the event will be on Wednesday, July 8th at Downing Street. It is centred around "balls", as they say "big balls, small balls, footballs,...hairballs, beachballs, ...", a sort of festival atmosphere. Further details are under the 'Blog' section of the website, and there is a event page on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/events/1455266081436327 .

 My dear friend the late Anwar Sadat summed up people like you very well when he was describing Muhamar GaddhafiDuck. There is crazy. There is fucking crazy. Then there is "100% insane and possessed of the Devil". Keep counting your toes. You'll never know when the Illuminati may remove or add some because you are "in the know". 














 For some reason that seems to make a vague connection in my mind as well. I know there's been quite a bit written about their presence in temples there. I'm going to have a look. 















































































 OK you'll get what you want. The matter of "more than that" in terms of Zinoviev comes from a speech by Leon Trotsky against Zinoviev at the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks/Communists as quoted by John Bunyan in 'The Origin of Forced Labor in the Soviet State 1917-1921', John Hopkins Press, 1967. Bunyan quotes Trotsky as saying that Zinoviev gave a number of **99%**. This is probably exaggerated by Trotsky though it is hard to judge for reasons I will be explaining below. Leonard Shapiro in 'The Russian Revolutions of 1917: The Origins of Modern Communism', Basic Books, New York, 1984 gave the quote as **90%**. Bunyan's quotation is more reputable, but I downgraded it because Trotsky, as a representative of the extreme right of the Bolsheviks at the time, was obviously partisan.

Here's the trick. Until some historian with a rather limited field of interest manages to dig the **real** minutes of the Congress out of the Soviet archives  rather than the falsified ones presented by the USSR government we won't know the exact number for sure. The Soviet government, of course, had no reason to preserve the words of Zinoviev himself. He was murdered one day after his 'trial' as part of the 'Trial of the Sixteen' on August 24 1936 to preserve the 'proletarian power' of the torturers and their bosses with dachas on the Black Sea. You don't preserve the words of so-called 'traitors' - especially if they are right.

Now here's the important point. It is not **my** scholarship. It is the scholarship **of the world**, at least that part of the world outside of a sect degenerated into a cult. I am not an academic. I am merely an ordinary person with an interest in Russian history, and just because I know far more than a true believer doesn't mean I am an expert in any sense.

If you wish to educate yourself beyond the realm of slogans I would suggest looking at 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War 1917 -1921: An Annotated Bibliography, Chapter 18`. The title of this chapter is `Popular Hostility to Soviet Rule`, and it runs from pages 334 to 340. Pages 337 and 338 are missing in the version available on the internet. 

It is hard for me to judge if your lack of knowledge is legitimate or a sophomoric debating tactic. In any case you can educate yourself in regards to any legitimate study of the economic history of the USSR. Start with Carr`s history of same. He makes a heroic effort to discern fact from the fantasy of Soviet `statistics`. You can then consult Lenin's own works which are, more or less, publically available in terms of the debate about the NEP as well as pretty well *every* legitimate study of the period that isn't special pleading for the developing new ruling class.

As I said, it is hard for me to determine if an American sectarian in the 21st century is really under the illusion that their world of so-called 'actual numbers' of public opinion surveys ever existed in other times or places or if this is, once more, sophomoric debating. In a country as per 1921 Russia where conquered areas such as the Caucasian republics and Central Asia were under military occupation and where large areas of the country such as the Tambov area were in open rebellion and where dissent could mean death there is no American leftist "actual number". Especially as the new ruling class was nowhere as developed as it was later in 'Stalin's war against the peasants' in the early 1930s.

In a situation where there was widespread opposition to the new ruling class amongst both the working class as evidenced by the strike waves of 1921 and *especially* the dozens of peasant uprisings the Bolsheviks had to repress there are no 'actual numbers', merely the use of poison gas to exterminate peasant rebels in the forests of Tambov.

Once more there is a world of real history, not "my" history, outside of the world you have decided to enclose yourself in. In comparison to your world the Catholic Church is honest. 









 As I said you are not a moderator. Your errors have been plainly pointed out, once more to the tune of 406,000.  Are you really so childish that you think that somebody will obey your orders just because you say so. Take it to the real moderators and stop your false fronts. Your habits of deception are pretty obvious.  If you don't want to be attacked 'personally' don't play act and make false arguments just because you think they are amusing. Others have a different concept of reality ie that there *is* a reality. 














 It is, of course, **not** "rehashing the other story that it quoted as is plain from the text. It obviously added to it and presented its own perspective. The whole context as pointed out to you to the tune of the 406,000 previous references is pretty obvious, and your claim of 'originality' for the source you quoted is absurd. The facts are obvious as I have pointed out. Your claim as to originality is not connected to reality.

I have to admit you had me going for a little while. At the first I thought you were some sort of monitor of this subreddit as you seemed to imply. Just like I thought you were somebody from Oklahoma familiar with the story in question rather than an argumentative Canadian. You, of course, are not either one. I forgot the level of deception common on reddit. 

Then I checked your comment history. At the first it seemed like you were part of the Bugs Bunny Political Correctness Brigade. Then I went further and you were nothing more than an ordinary right winger. Given the mentality of both reddit  marching columns I have little doubt that you can be both at the same time.

Seems like you are just somebody who likes to argue and provoke. Trust me. It is gone when you are 25 for well over 99% of the population. 

Believe it or not there are adults in this world who take opinions seriously. Hopefully you will eventually grow into that. 





























 I checked. The 'Oklahoma's Own' article is as much an 'primary source' as the 'Alternet' one is. This has been an ongoing story that has been reported in *hundreds/thousands* of sources and dates back to 2014 or earlier. The reports of the passing of the Bill date back to February 2015. A Google search of the story shows... 407,000 hits ! I'm afraid that the 'Oklahoma's Own' story is certainly not 'primary' is any sense either temporal or in terms of content. It is very much a 'public domain' matter where 407,000 people, not all unique granted, have commented for over a year. I think you should revise your opinion. The 'Oklahoma's Own' story is only 'primary in the same sense that a report on a Presidential speech repeated in 100,000s of places is primary because it was filed 2 seconds before others. Less so actually as the story you mention was predated by tens of thousands of others.

OK you are entitled to your opinion, but in my view your opinion is 'grossly' inaccurate to the tune of hundreds of thousands. Can you point to *any* unique matter that was posted in 'Oklahoma's Own' that was not mentioned thousands of times before and which 'Alternet' can be accused of copying without attribution ?

Just as an incidental point as neither 'Alternet' nor 'Oklahoma's Own' can claim to be "original" what infinitesimal percent of news stories either in print or on the internet can claim to be truly "original" ?  I'm sure that a lot of local news actually is, but for anything outside of that I think a thousandth of a percent may be an overestimate.  









 I don't think so. First of all neither the 'Alternet' source nor the 'Oklahoma's Own' source are blogs, and I am certainly not connected with either one. Second of all the 'Alternet' source is *not a copy of the news story that appeared in Oklahoma's Own'*. It is a rewrite, and I'm sure that somebody connected to the original *could* complain about the lack of attribution. You have to understand that the audience of the two sources are not comparable at all, probably to the tune of 1000 to one. A general reader like myself is much more likely to encounter the story on 'Alternet' than elsewhere. Also, did it appear in *other* more local sources as well ? I'll try and check.

You may have cause for complaint about AlterNet's policies, and I can appreciate your concerns. Perhaps you should take it up with their editors. 














 Indeed. As I said to another commentator on a different place: I definitely would never shop in such a place myself, and neither would anyone with whom I come in contact with on a day to day basis. The clientele of such places tend to be of a higher socioeconomic status. Personally I live in what might be described as an unfashionable mid-working class neighbourhood. In the town here I live the highest proportion of customers of such places would be in the two neighbourhoods known as 'Hippy Heaven' (where good hippies go when they die) and 'Trendy Town'. I'm sure there is lesser but still a fairly high concentration out in the suburbs as well. Perhaps I get carried away with the snark at the pretentiousness of pseudo-progressives sometimes, but I have to get my little dig in now and then.

There are, by the way, labor issues connected to Whole Foods (Hole Foods ?) as well, but I can't write a manifesto for everything. 









 Ok. Sorry about the mistake. 




 It depends on what you consider anarchism to be. If you think that it involves the continuation of the commitment of the vast majority of the movement to rational thought then it is one more brick in the edifice against 'mystical belief' in some vague idea of natural. If you hold to the traditional belief of the vast majority of the movement in the exploitative nature of the market then you should be right at home with this little further tidbit. As I said, it all depends on how you conceive certain things that the worldwide movement has always held to and still holds today. I admit it is trivial, but most of the world is trivial.
