 How can trees be real if our eyes aren't real? 




 i hate "I HAVE INSOMNIA" no you dont you just didnt get much sleep the past couple of nights... 




 How much IP do you get at the end though? if it's the same as normal bots games that'd be pretty lame 









 he is actually correct i once had a friend who saw 60fps for 5 seconds and his eyeballs exploded :/ he is blind now. 




 Or 6. The number 6. Think about it six has 3 letters, 3 x 2 = an upside down 9. 9 is the prime number of 23, 23 is equal parts 2 and 3. 2 x 3 = 6. Coincidence? I think not. 




 Man, remember when this shit would show up on summoner showcase? :( those were the days 




 but do u play c8, m8? 




 yeah! exactly like i was really really exhausted and was completely done with the world, and if my bloods didnt stabilise when they did we wouldnt be having this conversation. I just hope there arent diabetics out there that are depressed and dont know why :/ it's such a simple cure 




 damn :/ Thank you though :) 




 Ive got an insane number of things happening in my life that'd depress anyone but ever since i started insulin 3 months ago my depressed rather suddenly came to an end, and i never really found out what caused it or for that matter, ended it. So i was wondering, did anyone else get depressed BEFORE finding out they got diagnosed, due to high blood sugar etc?? and did i then go once starting insulin? Just curious 




 ah TIL. Im here in the UK :P your system seems more accurate though 




 are glasses paid for by the NHS if needed? 




 can someone explain? i only recently got diagnosed and i was ignorant before . 




 I got told i had diabetes a few months after a pretty severe car crash (which is believed to be the cause) and i remember waking up on 2 occasions feeling INSANELY hungry along with shaking and other low symptoms. Is that normal? was it caused by the diabetes??? 




 my mum and sister use this one on me all the time! it drives me mad! My girlfriend has yet to do so which is pretty nice, but i hope that one day she'll pick up on the signs that im low, might save my life one day who knows xD 




 btw folks a normal person's blood sugar is meant to be around 4-7 so you can imagine how rough these guys where feeling. Diabetes sucks, I wouldnt be here if i hadnt gotten diagnosed when i did, not because of the diabetes itself but because of the depression it caused. If you're depressed, peeing a lot, drinking a lot, get cramps, etc then get it checked out you could have type 1. 




 Hey man, it's rude to talk with your mouth open. 




 I THINK HE SAID HE LOVES IT WHEN REDDIT TURNS INTO A RICH CUNT 




 I don't think that's possible, sir. 




 You need a bigger desk.
