 Berkeley. I'm sorry, but this is one of the most common errors and it's infuriating. It's Berkeley. 














 Incredible summary--thank you so much for taking the time and thought!  




 Haven't been there but my favorite in Old Town is Miner's Gems. They have a lot of very fine stuff to browse--higher prices, but higher quality.  




 The only ones that are "easy" to polish by hand are softer sedimentary rocks. You'll have quite a bit of trouble with the obsidian by hand, even with the toughest of all sandpaper. Actually, one of things that has made polishing more fun on the ones I do by hand is using diamond files. They sound expensive--it's just synthetic grit with a handle. Much quicker and more fine-tuned than sandpaper or a sanding sponge. I have many crinoid and coral fossil specimens in a softer matrix and they clean off very well with diamond files. I cleaned matrix from a garnet (garnet schist) with the diamond files well too. 
























 I agree--I've seen a few similar crinoids from northern michigan pieces I have. They often look like something far more interesting when cemented in at certain angles but that's what it is. 




 This is quite old and wouldn't work, I am imagining, for the few systems there are, which have custom languages developed already (D-Wave's systems anyway)... great find though! 









 Based on your other finds, which are all marine, I would agree that that is a large scallop. 




 Beautiful--where is this located? Generally, that is? 




 Given the low quality of the "silver" material I would guess it's glass with some additive. These are common everywhere. If someone wanted to show off a piece of even non-gem quality sapphire they wouldn't dishonor it with that mounting. 




 I have not had luck with these in a tumbler and don't recommend it. What's really fun is hand polishing these--very rewarding if you have the patience and some elbow grease to spare. 




 Agreed, lucky, lucky you....this is a dream find. 




 This is one of my favorites of any posted here. Never seen it before...doesn't look real (although I know it is). 









 Sir Terry Pratchett made one. This is a rather badass thing; digging up his own ore and working with an ancient metalworking expert. http://gizmodo.com/5643189/sir-terry-pratchetts-meteorite-sword-is-the-closest-we-get-to-excaliber 




 It looks like a highly polished stromatolite. The only strange thing is that the edges are rounded off as much as I would expect if that were the case. 









 Intel has been clear though, to their great credit, that onboarding is easier than with GPUs. Still, actual users of the first-gen Phi say that optimization is still a very long process--sometimes in the end just as long as porting code to run on GPUs. The upside is that when they do that they by default get better performance on their regular Xeons.  




 NVIDIA is afraid...in this space (at this point for this particular type of large-scale systems that MIC was drawn for). They owned the concept of accelerated large-scale compute but the addition of on-package memory, the ability to swap between coprocessor/plain Xeon is the only thing like it, and they have the x86/programming ecosystem. CUDA, OpenCL are great--NVIDIA GPUs offer way higher performance, but the ease is the real crux here.  




 Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance). 




 Yeah that likely didn't come from NC.... 









 Can you let me know what state/region this was found? 


































 See, when I see something like a sink buried in the middle of the woods posted here the "backstory alert" clangs. Those grim, grim possibilities... Or yeah, they just didn't want to pay for the trash pickup. Far less interesting story prospect. 





























 Found something similar near Apache Junction AZ some time ago and indeed it's hematite. 




 To be honest my first (grim) thought was that it might be a ceremonial object for covering grave dirt. 




 There is some serious backstory here. That's all I can say. What's on the coin? Does it burn your fingers when you touch it? *shiver* 









 "Hush a bye baby" -- my god that is a chilling discovery. And very awesome. Congrats. What country/region? 












































 Well then it's definitely from the moon! Congratulations!
