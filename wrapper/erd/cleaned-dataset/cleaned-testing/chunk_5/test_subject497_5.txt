 At first I did. I really really did. I sobbed for hours just thinking "why did I go in". I spent days on the couch wishing I could see her standing over me. 

But ultimately, I don't think I can regret going in. 

I know that Diane must have been a very pure soul to achieve something like that, almost pure enough to attain Moksha (in Hinduism, it's freedom from rebirth. An extremely perfect state. Its *way* better than rebirth, but it's hard for we who aren't very spiritually advanced yet to grasp). 

I can't help that I wish I could see her again. But I also fear that her attachment to me could hinder her on her journey.

I'm sure that when she departed, she took birth in much better circumstances than in our house, worrying about me. 
 




 Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss, and I also sometimes feel guilty that Diane and I got to, essentially, say goodbye when most people don't. 

I don't think it's a matter of you being unlucky, though. I don't think this was given to me because I deserved it, but maybe because I *needed* it due to my spiritual immaturity and weakness. I do know that Diane deserved a chance to say goodbye though.  




 That's so very sad, I can't even stand to picture my wife in that situation. I wish that coupled had gotten the last moments together Diane and I had. When I first learned learned her death was caused by an aneurysm, it seemed like something that must be incredibly rare. But now when I tell people about it, it feels like everybody knows of someone who's died this way.  




 Really? I wasn't on here back then, can you link to it? I would be interested in reading about similar situations.   




 Thank you.
