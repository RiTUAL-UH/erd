 I just felt there was very little substance to it. Very little happened. She plodded along - met Adam (who then disappeared sharpish) and plodded along some more until the finale of the book. And that was it. Not a bad book - just...I expected more from McEwan I suppose. Especially after *Sweet Tooth*. 




 I would recommend *Sweet Tooth* over *The Children Act*. I really enjoyed it, but it did again feel a bit overlong in places. No worse than Atonement. But yes, it was a really good read.  




 I found DA Origins to be the worst for this.

Also a steam game called *Legend of Grimrock*. The spiders in that are huge and they jump at you. Their bodies fill the entire screen as they lunge. They make the scariest noise and they just attack randomly so it's super difficult to expect. Also very difficult to run away. 




 Does Bloodborne count?

I've played horror games. Slender. Amnesia, etc. 

But when that damn werewolf broke out of that door three paces ahead of me I've never jumped so much at a game in my life. 




 That is perfect. Thankyou very much :) 




 50 Shades from Christian's perspective. *gag/vomits.* 




 Well played, sir :) 




 Grey 




 Mostly I'm thinking of the kind you get through the door. But email spam is also useful. Any kind of crap you don't want to receive, that isn't quite a letter, and just goes straight in the bin.

It's all for research. I promise it's not as weird a question as you might think. 




 I haven't read *Enduring Love* but I really want to. *Saturday* as well. *Atonement* was great but I felt it was a bit too long, parts were too dragged out.

Did you read *Sweet Tooth*? 




 You should read *'The Cement Garden'* by him. That's an uncomfortable read. On Chesil Beach was just awesome. 




 Doesn't the Wii U have Gamecube compatibility? Not something I've ever had to consider so I don't know... 




 It actually did! :)  




 Literature does that ;) 




 Then make it big enough. That's the point :) 




 I suppose so. But with the gameplay being so different to any other MOBA I feel like it doesn't quite fit into the genre. It looks much more interesting. And I don't really like MOBA's. 




 Thankyou for this. My life is a better place with this in it. 




 I remember when I first got my original Xbox. Way back when. I really wanted to play the first Halo game. I'd heard great things about it, but the person who sold me my xbox had lent it out, and was waiting to get it back to give it to me.

I thought I could wait, and not play my xbox till I got Halo. But I got a pile of games with it. Midtown Madness. A Rayman game. A few others. But, most interestingly of all I got a game called...

Morrowind.

I didn't know what this was. The cover was a title and a symbol. And I refused to play it, waiting for Halo. I put it off. I would go over and pick up the case and look at it. For some reason I was strangely drawn to it. There was no reason for me to like it. I was young, mostly new to gaming, never really played or heard of anything like this. Didn't know what an RPG was. After a while I thought *"Dammit, I'm just gunna play this game. I can't stop thinking about it, sod Halo"*

It. Was. Amazing. It still is to this day one of the best RPG's I've played. It changed how I viewed and played games, what stories I wrote and how I wrote them. Introduced me to the concept of games being more than racing, or platforming. 

I never did get Halo. I didn't play the first one until the MCC came out on XB1. 

Also Fable 2 on Xbox 360. The only reason I got a 360, and fuck was that an amazing game. My mom got me a really good 360 (there were about two dozen version (at an estimate guess) and I was worried I wouldn't get the right one). But my Mom pulled through and got me the best one, and my Grandma got me Fable 2. First Christmas I didn't spend with my family, I was playing Fable 2.

Also Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. My parents tricked me and my sisters and pretended we had nothing. Then unveiled it. I got Space Jam. My little sister got Casper. And my big sister got Crash Bandicoot. This was in...'96?? From that moment on I've been a gamer.

Tl;dr: Morrowind for Xbox. Fable 2 for 360. Crash Bandicoot for PS1. 




 Here is the showcase of the gameplay in action, showing you the core gameplay system, and it is just...awesome.

[Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp3NKQlJPuo)

And another video, about the game in general.

[Clickity 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiwzcurrhAY)

The first video is more exciting. Watch that first. :) 




 Not if I'm planning on having 90k by the end of the year. It's taken me too long and I need to knuckle down :(

But thanks for the encouragement :) 




 I was meant to work on my novel today too. I'm just coming up to 20,000 words in my own novel. Making piss-poor progress.

I was meant to work on my game today. I didn't. Thankfully my lead isn't too demanding just yet, and I still have time. Though I think the workload is going to smack me, and hard, when it comes. This is just for the demo. This isn't even the whole game.

Ooh! I did get to play bass. Didn't quite learn a new song but I perfected two I had been practicing and started a third.

I nearly went out a bought a ukulele for the shits and giggles - because secretly everyone wishes they could play the ukelele. Right?

About 75% less productive today than I wanted to be. I got an assignment for my *other* game today, which isn't too hard, so I hope I can chuck that out tomorrow...

*walks off grumbling about productivity* 




 Inspiration is a BS lie. If anyone worked only when they were "motivated" or "inspired", nothing would ever, ever get done. 




 Fine I'll introduce a caveat: as good as, if not somewhat better, than what most people would expect from a contemporary AAA release. No game is flawless.

But my own experience, on XB1, was, and is still, perfect. 




 I saw gameplay. I've seen the core function of the game. And that in itself looks awesome. I'm certainly skeptical because the inherent flaws are immediate, but I'm willing to give them a chance and see what they've done to sort them out. I don't trust expo demonstrations, I really don't. So I'm going to keep my eye out and see what happens, and how it expands, and, most importantly, on what they have to say about the gameplay.

Otherwise, it looks awesome. 




 The Elder Scrolls - the three main ones.

Why absolutely no nudity? I really have to ask. Because The Witcher ticks *every single one* of those boxes.  




 0.01% inspiration.

99.99% GET OFF YOUR ARSE AND DO SOME BLOODY WORK, LAD! 




 I got into the beta for TESO. That game was dead to me before it's release. I know enough to be cautious about games, and I rarely ever buy games on the day of their release. For obvious reasons.

I just want to be so excited for this game. 




 Buy a Wii u. Backwards compatibility, after all. 




 Sorry, bud =] 




 Computer Science. Will shoehorn you into programming, as a lot of science is programming languages...(as far as I know.)

Also, as pointed out, even if you don't go into gaming you'll find that with a Computer Science degree, any other job will almost definitely earn you more money.

 




 Memento.

Hey, see what I did there ;) 




 *The Virgin Suicides*, by Eugenides. And,

*On Chesil Beach*, by Ian McEwan. 

Because they are the two strongest openings to a book I have ever encountered. 




 Support the industry that you love. Flaws and all.

I think that's the crux of the argument. 




 That's a fair enough statement. 

A release date would also be nice :) 




 This is totally dependant on where you live. I live in the UK and there are caveats that allow people to not be paid - assuming that the person doing the working doesn't mind working voluntarily.

If you're american it might change state-to-state. Or anywhere else. I know the UK government does supply the info, and can be found on their website. Otherwise, any governing bodies for films should have the information somewhere. 

Either way the answer is a Google away. 




 400M into advertising. Thankyou Activision.

100M into making the game. 


(Extremely rough estimates) 




 Given the spate of absolutely abysmal releases recently (or not-so-recently), when a studio like CD Projekt Red comes along and does everything perfectly, they're praised. Rightly so, they even included a little slip inside the game thanking people for buying their game. That's how you do a game release right. 

Then on the other hand you have a game more typical of a AAA release: buggy, unfinished, poor quality. Complaining is the gamers way of striving for something better than what we have. 

TW3 proved that it can be done, and be done perfectly. It's easy to slate a bad game when a few weeks back we had one of the best releases in recent memory - and for a truly excellent game. 

As for frame rate issues for TW3. I got it on XB1 and I've hardly ran into any issues. 




 Don't blame devs, devs aren't to blame. Devs want to put out as good a game as they possibly can, but that's not up to them. It's up to the publishers. Blame the publishers. 




 You run around and shoot things. 




 Physical books. Because a library on a device can't even compare to a library on a shelf. 




 I know I am. That game looks amazing. Who else will be getting it when it comes out? 




 For two weeks every summer I used to go my Nanna and Granddads house. It was massive, absolutely huge. Had a swimming pool and a jacuzzi. They used to rent out the bottom floor to holiday-makers during the summer-period, that's how nice and big it was. There was this tree we used to climb (my siblings and many, various cousins). About 2-3 acres of garden just to run around in and play. It was amazing. Really great time.

Anyway a few years back they moved out - the place was too large to look after and my grandparents were getting on. Next thing I heard it had been knocked down and a block of flats put in. That sucks.  




 That's fair enough. Whatever works better for you. You just have to be on top of your word count and progress. And I know how slow it can be going when you aren't sure what your characters' next steps should be. 




 I wrote my first novel spontaneously. I prefer to say organically, because it grew organically as it went. 

This one I have a plan for. And I think maybe a plan is better. Certainly this second novel has more depth, and more is happening underneath. The characters come together and intertwine better than in my first one. Purely because I've got it all planned out what exactly my two main protagonists are doing. Even when they're not together I know what they've been doing in the absence. 

Haven't not completed this novel I can't support a structured plan entirely - but the way things are going, I'm happy to endorse a plan. 




 Maybe write a decent structure, and a proper plan. Then, when you only have time to write a page or two, you know exactly what you want to write for those two pages. Best advice I can give. Keep you on track. Heading in the right direction. Less turning around and rewriting and seeing what was happening, and if it makes sense and is leading in the right direction. 




 I'm making a list of things to watch/listen to/read that'll help me write when I'm not in the mood. Anything you can contribute is great. 




 Not a horror novel. Horror elements. But not in the orthodox sense.

You got a decent plan for it? A structure to follow? 




 I should have guessed that. Ah well, I answered another question for you for free :D

This novel it's about malevolent spirits. I'm heading towards a very difficult scene, that I've been slowly working my way towards sentence-by-sentence for weeks. I'm there now, just a few more details. So it's been slow progress. 

You sound like you're already aware of how bad it is to rewrite, rather than just finish. So I don't have to warn you about the pitfalls of rewriting constantly. Whatever you write you're not going to be happy with it. It's not meant to be good. It's not going to be good. It's never going to be good. Leave it be, that's how it is with everyone. It doesn't matter how many drafts you write it's still going to be the same, and you'll never like it. You have to edit it into shape. That's where it all starts to come together. When you edit it. Not when you write it. 









 Progress wise? About 25k words, aiming to finish at 90k. Nice round number :)

And yours? 




 I'm pretty much the same. Progress is super slow. Almost at a halt. 




 To keep my life on some kind of track:

* Read (this one will never end)

* Complete The Witcher 3

* Finish writing novel

* Finish work on video game x 2

* Put poetry on Figment/Reddit for feedback (done - awaiting feedback)

* Convince others to start YouTube channel with me.

* Find short story competitions and enter

* Check Shooting People [film jobs]

* Check IndieDB [indie-game jobs]

And that's it. Just do all that and my life will head in the right direction. Not. So. Easy.



 




 I'd say you could possibly come back to DA after The Witcher 3, but I just think it would be so flawed after playing TW3 - an unadulterated masterpiece.

I'm sorry to have put you off DA. It started well, but didn't hold it. I wanted to like it but couldn't, so I know what it's like to have to drop a game. Let's just say - if you do drop it - I'm saving you a few hours that will only end in heartbreak. 




 Story is better. Combat is better. Protagonist is better. Quest system and quests are better. There isn't as much variety within the biomes - and I have to give Inquisition it's due, those dragon's were impressive. But The Witcher has better gameplay, and a more polished look. There's also less time sorting through your party to see if the trousers your mage has on is as good as the one in your pack. You only have to look after Geralt; infinitely easier. The story in The Witcher holds together tighter, even when you're away from it for a while doing Witcher-y things and side quests. 

This is all The Witcher 3, Witcher 2 is somewhat different. But if you're playing 2, finish it, it's a great game. Then move sharpish onto 3. Which is an amazing game. 




 Just wanted to say thanks for this. I've come across Grist before, but not poetry. It's nice to see poetry isn't dead in England. 




 I find that games like that are so long you'll never get one or the other finished if you don't just concentrate on one. I recommend concentrating on just one. And I recommend concentrating on just The Witcher.

I'm sorry. They're such good games. 




 Don't write a strict outline. Write a basic one, a bare one. Chart down the major points, and nothing in between. This gives you absolute freedom to do anything in between. You have the main points down, and those are the turning points, you just head from to the other to the next. If a new character comes in, there's space to do that, if one dies, there's space for it. If something totally significant happens that you hadn't counted on, that's fine, just as long as you're heading to your next key point, you're on track.

Then *edit edit edit edit edit edit*. 




 Whilst I enjoyed Inquisition, I tried really hard to finish it, it just got to a point where I couldn't do it. It just wasn't working out.

I recommend saving yourself the trouble and just swapping it out for *The Witcher 3*. Which in a few hours proved better than the 40+ I put into DA before giving up. 




 What's wrong with the public domain name Loki? 




 I've got another one:

Somebody called me pretentious once. I was so outraged I spat out my latte.

Ah, coffee related humour.  




 Yours to have =] 




 Times like I wish I had played

* Any of the Mass Effect games

* Any of the Uncharted games

* any of the Just Cause games.

Iyam behind. 




 What you meant to say was: "Another greedy, money-grabbing attempt to subvert what was hitherto a decent escape from a declined, capitalistic culture too concerned with shit tv."

Mostly it's the "shameless, money-grabbing, leave no survivors (especially, ya know, art) attitude. 




 You just wanna get the specs. HD, LED are your main concerns. If you can push into 4K then why not. Sony do overall make good TV's but don't entirely discount the other good TV brands. (My kinect is covering the maker of my TV, I think it's a panasonic. I dunno I got it from Tesco). 




 So like a mo-cap suit? 

Sounds feasible. My only issue would be power, having a big ole' battery strapped to your condom-suit somewhere. 




 Ps4 I think is meant to be technically superior. But being as the only decent exclusive PS4 has is Bloodborne - a gothic, low-lit game - then eh... Killzone looked good, but I have no idea if the game is any good.

The E3 footage of Horizon looking stunning, however.

What really matters is this: graphics don't make or break a game. Now what's an amazing game? Shadow of the Colossus. Not the best looking game. But it's one of the best that will ever be made. 




 That explains the parentheses in your title =] 




 Why did the hipster burn his tongue? 

He drank coffee before it was cool. 




 Game is this? 




 Ah I really loved The Maze Runner, though it was fantastic. 

John Dies is a good book, a touch long, I thought, but actually a very good book. I got into it fairly quickly. 




 Sounds like you want an Xbox One then. 




 From your list: Evolve is a very good game, but I don't know how many people play it now. Ori is meant to be a spectacular game, but not a very long one - though it is the cheapest on your list. GTA5 might be a good shout, people will still be playing that online, and you can get a good few hours out of the campaign.

Otherwise, The Witcher 3, hands down, is the best way to go. 




 Hands down :)

Best movie of all time, imo.  




 Well, this is perfect.

That's it, I'm done. There's nothing more I can say. I few itchy word choices, but that kept the tone low and somber, rather than edgy and sick, which is what I would have gone for. 
The pace is good, the style and narrative is spot-on, absolutely perfect.

But I think the first three lines aren't as strong as the rest of the poem. I think you use those to find your voice, and it doesn't come through until the fourth line. That's my only critique. 

Thought I'd return the favour for *My Dreams are Fire* but this is kinda so perfect it belies critique.  




 Thanks, friend. I wrote this a good number of years back in an emotional rage, and only recently came to and tidied it up. So it's good to hear some positive feedback, that it isn't just a messed up piece of shit. So thanks. I'm glad to find you liked it. 

Appreciate you putting so much thought and effort into this, I really do :) 




 The Prestige. 'Cause Nolan. 




 Thanks, that was great feedback. It's always nice to hear what others think, and it was pretty awesome for me to read too. Thanks, stranger =] 




 Well I guess the only thing I would need - were I to set out on my own venture - is advice on promoting. I've promoted stories before, sometimes fairly successfully, it's just a bitch. A lot of back scratching. For someone successful it would be worth getting an insiders view. All I need is a story I can either serialise, or work into a full novel. 




 Thanks, this was great. I will rewrite it tomorrow. Seems I'm going to have to elucidate some of this vagueness. 




 Horse Armor. It doesn't matter where it started. That's where it went to shit. 




 Bray-vo! En-core! 




 Ahh, I see what you did there! hehehe. 




 Let's talk about something positive. Turn that frown upside down! Whoo! 




 Ah, it'll take a lot more than a touch of negativity to make me regret ever receiving a fantastic little orange envelope. 




 Yeah I made a thread, on the gaming subreddit too, got a fair bit of negativity. Y'know I expected some people to not agree with me, but I also expected someone to agree with me - at least a little bit. Nope. 




 It's worth it to read to expand the world, and the Underthing most of all. It is worth it for people who Rothfuss's world and writing.  




 Dopamine. 




 Yeah, I got all that. I've never seen a call for a query that doesn't include a bit of information about a book - a blurb, in essence. Everything else I have. A synopsis too. Enough to cater to individual agents requests. Just want to tidy this up, the rest, I think, is ok. 




 Trying to find a balance between vagueness and information. Don't know if that's a good idea, though. 




 Also no, this isn't all of my query. I have a cover letter too. But that's its own demon. 




 Care to lend an experienced hand (advice)? 




 It's a query letter. Part of the requirement. Just a short synopsis to describe the book, and get a feel for what it is. Blurb is just the best way to phrase it. 




 This poem is a few years old at this point and I only met you this afternoon. ^^ =D. I've always put a lot of time and editing into this so it wasn't good to start with.

Thanks =] 




 Bloody Fallout 4 first. I'm pretty sure that after that it'll be the next TES. I mean, they can just sheer off a small team to remaster Morrowind, that's all I'm asking for. 




 No, no...I didn't misspell 'fourty'. English...English spelling.

I'm going for vagueness, and I'm just trying to find the balance between information and vague. 




 Have some happiness =] 




 One, thanks for that :)

Two, yeah, blurb writing...not a talent. Trying to fit a lot of information in a short space, not easy. 




 Thankyou, and I absolutely understand what you're saying about there being too many phrases. I certainly missed that one.

You're second blurb is absolutely perfect, except I want to mention his...they're not humans, I guess the best way to say it would be homunculus - and I want to introduce that there is one of those who manages to catch up with him as well. 




 Thanks for typing back. I'm glad you enjoyed the critique. I always like it when people put back saying they were grateful rather than just telling to F-off and leave their poem alone. 

As far as the poem goes, it really was excellent, and thank you for letting me read it.  




 A game as excellent as Morrowind being the exception, of course. :) 




 I'm going to start pushing trying to publish this soon, and would really love a polished blurb to go along with the book. I would appreciate any advice, or insightfulness you have.

The novel is called Loki:

Loki is a born and bred survivor, having been chased for fourty years he is confident his abilities will keep him alive and out of their hands[*]. A shocking death and a surprise ambush from one of his old kin may just knock everything he knows out from under his feet. His pursuers are growing more and more desperate, and he might finally have to resurface to face them once and for all.

*generally don't know what to do with this. Their hands is too vague, but I'm trying to not be too specific.
 




 I'd ask you more questions but then you risk becoming my blog/serial guru. And you don't want that. 

Thanks for everything =] 




 Meaning you're getting back into it? Or not? 




 Whoa, thanks so much that's an excellent reply. Really great information. 

Also well done, impressive statistics. No longer active, why's that?

 




 I have heard of Skywind, I meant to look into and totally forgot until just this moment.  




 Anyone else agree? I would love to get a chance to play that game on Xbox One or PS4. 




 I'm sure you know, but just to warn you TSRoST is nothing like TKKC in general. Really not even similar anything between them. Just Auri. 

*adds Ready Player One to 'reading list'* 




 No problem on the feedback. And that's a great solution. 'Though' probably wasn't the best choice but I think you've found it of your own accord (certainly better than my suggestion). Awesome. :)

And you continue the alliteration - you, yours. Double-win =] 




 That's really interesting. And I knew absolutely nothing about it. Mind if I ask how one would go about starting up one of these? And maintaining it? And promoting it, how you seem to have done. 




 He's a selfish prick too preoccupied with his own survival, and too wrapped up in his own conflicts. 




 Thanks man, that's perfect =] I love it. 




 That is the best trilogy of books I've ever read. I cannot recommend a book more wholeheartedly than I recommend The Amber Spyglass. It is fantastic. Amazing. Perfect. Just...finish the trilogy. I can't put into words how good it is.
