 For those of you saying that the kid wanted it and that it's not a big deal but a sexual fantasy for teenage boys, answer me this: What happens if and when a horny and immature teenage boy doesn't use protection and knocks up this sexual predator and she decides to keep the baby?

 These South American teams are fun to watch when they play each other. I can't remember a match where they didn't attack for 90 minutes like this. I'm amazed that Mexico put out their B team and played that well. Raul Jimenez looks like a player. He hasn't played all that much for Atletico Madrid has he? If he plays like that in La Liga this season then Simeone will be a happy man. 

Edit: Yes, I know Mexico is not from South America but they play with the same kind of style and verve.
