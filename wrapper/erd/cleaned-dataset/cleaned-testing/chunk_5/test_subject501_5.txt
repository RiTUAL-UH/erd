 What? 




 I loved the cinematography. Robert Elswit is one of my favorites, he shot two of the most beautiful looking films of 2014: this and Inherent Vice. 




 With example.

Thanks!! 




 His career, oh man his career. It would've gone places. 




 Wow that's pretty neat. 




 Hello again.

Pretty much most of the films on the list, out of the ones I've seen anyway. 









 Nope, who knows maybe they'll put him in right at the last second. 




 Great movie btw 














 Can somebody tell me a little about this character? 




 AWESOME!! 




 It's playing here in Perth.  




 Please provide examples as well. Thanks! (I'm new here) 




 Also, can someone please give a better/more appropriate subreddit to post this on, thanks! 




 Deepthroatin'  




 Holy.......fuckin shit. 









 A Paul Thomas Anderson collection. 




 That is hilarious. 




 He was fired? I didn't know that. 




 My dad was telling me that when he was in Germany, he was in this souvenir shop and this american guy was trying to buy all this merchandise with American dollars. He kept arguing with the woman who wouldn't take the dollars and saying how he needs to convert the currency to Euros. The American didn't understand and kept saying (in a typical American accent) "These are American Dollars! You gotta take the dollars GODDAMN!!" 




 Maybe. But Star Wars The Force Awakens will be. I guaran-fucking-tee it. 




 I think we shouldn't have evolved so far. I mean look, we're destroying the planet! I would rather be living happily in my straw hut or in a fuckin tree and hunting for food everyday with my spear or bow and arrow than be living in this world. Honest! 




 Watch a Disney movie.  




 NSFW because I'm not sure how weird this is going to get 




 Oh thank you so much. I'm good now, It's just been a very emotional day. Thank you so much for asking :)

 Have you seen the trailer? 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics

Go down to the bottom of 'other potential projects'. I stuffed up the wording, they haven;t announced it yet, my bad. 




 Well I actually just finished watching Into the Wild. I cried my fucking heart out okay? I'm not going to explain why, just watch the film and you'll find out. That's twice I've cried today :'( 




 The Batman Arkham games? Fuck yeah 




 Ummm why all the downvotes? 




 Fuck, I forget to mension shutter island. Awesome movie! Underrated! 




 Fight Club 




 That first teaser for the last airbender had me fucking stoked.

Also the Man of Steel trailers, although MOS was not as bad as people say it was. 




 I actually held my hand in front of the screen at first. It didn't fucking help. 




 Holy fucking shit! His assistant just smiled when he fell down! Man that is some of the most unsettling shit I've ever seen.

 How violent is it? How is the action? 









 "Fine I'll do it myself" FUCK YEAH ABOUT TIME THANOS! YOU STILL HAVEN'T DONE SHIT!! 




 Yes I agree. I've never heard echoes or wings for marie, but I will check them out. 
With me, I melt away when I listen to 'Breathe' by Pink floyd as well as the rest of the album.  




 I feel the EXACT the same way you do. I have a similar first experience with this song. I was in Germany with my family visiting my grandparents, I remember getting Love of Gold for my 10th birthday (Yes, I was way a head of my age with music, books and film; I still am)  and I remember waking up at exactly 7:00 in the morning and walking into the out onto the front porch  with the CD. It was beautiful outside, the sun was rising and the snow was gently melting off the grass and trees; it was beautiful. I remember sitting down and putting the CD in the player they had on the porch. For the whole 14 minutes I was blown away, just sitting on the porch to my grandparents house, looking out across the grass and forest. I'll never forget that day, after that I would listen to the song every morning. It is unarguably one of the best songs ever written and performed. Words can't even describe it. 




 Fuckin A 









 Dont downvote this, it's pretty cool
 




 I bet the picture of the joker and this pic of bats are exact reactions to eachother. 




 Fucking love this movie, I can't even describe what it's about. I didn't even know what the fuck is going on half the time, but something tells me you're not supposed to... 




 Noooooo that annoying little kid from Hugo? Seriously?  




 OP, what's actually happened? 




 Wow, awesome video! What's your favorite of his? 




 Now THAT was an excellent fucking trailer.

Sold. 




 Hell yeah! 




 Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before. I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book.

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman. Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant.

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR - I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen

edit- of course all of you know what Arkham Asylum is! Duh! (stupid me) 




 Let's not forget that the guy who re-wrote Batman v Superman has won an academy award for best adapted screenplay (Argo) 




 The Heat I thought was pretty decent. 




 Wow, I had no idea insomnia was a remake or that the prestige was adapted from a book. 




 Roger motherfucking Deakins. The man is a god. 




 An original film. Like he always does. 




 OP, you're a hero, but you seriously need to get rid of that job and find something you actually enjoy doing. I wish you all the best. 




 I agree. David Ayer nor Zack Snyder are perfect directors, with that said they have done VERY good movies in the past. End of Watch is one of the most underrated movies of the decade and, personally, I enjoyed 300, Man of Steel (although far from perfect)and Watchmen.
I'm hoping they don't stuff up the iconic characters they are dealing with. Both films have potential to be really bad, but they also have potential to be really really good. 




 Just need a little help, I saw on the cover of Death of the family, where you can see the Joker's face, It says "Volume 2". Do I need to read Vol 1? Or any of the crossover tie-in stories?  









 FTFM 




 What

The

Actual

Fuck 




 That guy seems to be enjoying it... 




 My father once called me a "fucking little cunt" when I was about 12. 




 Just post it to imgur and link it below! Also, please explain why it's your favorite, thanks! 









 Awesome! Let me know your thoughts after! 




 How?

Wow, thanks for all the downvotes! 




 ^ 




 Well, IMO, this is the best thing Marvel have done. It is (**IMO**) better than the first. It is slightly better than Daredevil, but I think it's a little unfair to compare those two as they are completely different. 

You get to spend a lot more time with the Avengers as characters, the humor is more present and a lot better than everything Marvel have done, the action is better handled than the first, the villain is much more interesting and funnier than Loki (not to say that he was a bad villain) and there's more Avengers- Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision (ESPECIALLY Vision) make great additions to the team. It improves upon everything!

 




 I fucking loved it, one of the best films of the year already.

I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. They really fleshed out all the characters, especially Hawkeye. I was surprised that Ultron was so funny...in a dark but good way.  




 The soundtrack hits hard. It was modified by Danny Elfman and that really translates onto the screen. It's great, and they use it at the most appropriate times.    




 One, and it's fucking epic. 









 They announced that Thanos would NOT make an appearance in Age of Ultron.

Sneaky fuckers they are.  




 No I'm afraid not.

Whaaaaaaat thats so cool! I need to find this now!!

The hunt begins! 




 FINALLY! an aussie collector.

Where did you get that version of dredd? 




 Yeah, it had just never been posted on here before, which I found surprising.  




 Hahaha true true 




 This sounds like a story. It is a leak from one of the crew members?
"an acclaimed actor" are you sure it isn't DiCaprio who was fighting with the director?  




 This just may be it. 




 and PTA? what do y'all think about him? 




 Yeah apparently they can only shoot a few hours at a time because the area where they are shooting is (mostly) untouched by man. Where did you learn that he's being a dick? Do you have a source on that? 




 Yeah I was a bit surprised to learn that they were shooting in NY. I also read somewhere that they are shifting the timelines as well, so that the childrens story will be set during the 80's and the adult story will be set in the 2010s.  









 Spiderman: That's right Sony, Fuck Off! 




 What the fuck!? They're shooting the 'it' remake in New York??? WHY? WHY WHY WHY WHY. This is my favorite book! Why are they setting it in the city??????????? It wont have the same effect as if it were set in a small town! 




 This should be pretty good. I hope so. 




 Exactly like murder. Why didn't I say that? 




 It means kill. So a snuff film is basically a porno except at the end, they kill either the man or the woman. Like they genuinely kill one of the actors in the porno. Sometimes they fake it, sometimes not... 




 Oh, I was under the impression that in some point during the film the tribe just randomly attacked the crew. Man, that is a fucking weird movie. 




 Sorry about all the questions, last one!

Did the tribe go apeshit when they found out the crew were hurting animals?

I'm too pussy to look this shit up, I'm afraid I'll see what you were talking about D: 




 So this tribe, are they friendly at first? You mentioned they go ham, I thought this meant they were ok in the beginning.  














 What the actual fuck. That's not even a movie. 




 I haven't seen the film what happened with the turtle   the monkey? 




 I dunno, It's just a thought.

Maybe when you exit the womb, you gain consciousness, so at the same time the life has left your previous body, it enters your new infant baby body. 




 *reincarnation  




 NSFW just in case.
  




 Wow, your collection is fucking amazing. Some great movies there. 














 What are your thoughts on the film? 




 This film is going to be biblical.  




 well....it looks kinda....fucking terrible. 




 Wow Depp is playing a normal character for once. This looks incredible. 









 OP, do you know if this girl is in the shit w/ her parents? How did your friends sister react to it? 




 I agree. He just starred in a gritty crime drama called 'A most violent year' and now the guy is about to be in one of the biggest films of all time (Star Wars, yes I'm calling it now) AND then he'll go on to star as a villain in a superhero movie! And that's just what I know of! 




 Both of the Antagonists in those films deserved their end. 









 Well, It'll make more than Skyfall did.

I think it may be better than Skyfall, as Mendes said that this will top it. 




 I really don't know what to say. Like......fuck.... 




 Why must Scarlett Johansson be so goddamn hot?

Anyway, I'm pumped out of my mind for this. If only it wasn't produced by Dreamworks they could go for a much grittier tone, more true to the original. 




 Not an action movie but Fight Club is up there with the great 90's films. 




 That interviewer, what a fucking idiot.

I've seen him before and I've never liked him, this just cements by opinion of that prick. 




 PLOT TWIST: The cookies are....evil.

I don't fucking know, alright? 




 GHOST IN A SHELL ARRRRGHHHH YEAHHHHSSSS 




 Could you elaborate on the first sentence? 




 I forgot this was coming out. It'll probably be terrible. 




 This hurts. 




 Birdman or American Sniper?

Or Whiplash 




 2010 - Inception

2011 - Drive

2012 - Django Unchained

2013 - Prisoners

Guess anyone? 




 [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/z2ybobW.png) from the trailer sold me. The first time I saw it, I thought to myself, THAT is Star Wars.  




 Is this just for America? Are there posts like these except for australia??? 




 Without giving too much away, how was Vision? Does he kick ass? 




 I actually agree with you there, I have always found villains to be much more interesting.
