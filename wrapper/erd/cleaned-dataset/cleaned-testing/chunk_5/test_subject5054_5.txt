 I deserved that. 




 I'm not really whining about it just explaining a possible explanation. Yes other countries get shat on, the US just happens to be the biggest target with lots of skewed perceptions which are easily mocked(fat, loud, proud bible thumpers), as well as it's cultural (and geographic) isolation from the rest of the world (American football, imperial system, military expenditures/incursions, healthcare system, tipping, not showing sales tax in the price, ez cheeze, etc.).

On top of all that, it's been the preeminent world super power for the past 70 years. The USSR was close militarily during the Cold War(really a wash because of nuclear arsenals, though with conventional weapons it lagged behind), although it lacked the economy to ultimately compete;  China is currently even economically (or a little bit stronger) but lacks the military projection that allows the US to dictate a lot of policy they wouldn't otherwise have the capability to pull off.

So you've got all these factors rolled into one country that's honestly just a big, easy, slow moving target for global mockery. It can get tired,  and it's like, we're exempt from sympathy because "we're like the rich white guys complaining about persecution".

The best part? When I respond in kind I'm just an ignorant, boorish American.

Oh well, I guess it's the price you've got to pay for your country's disproportionate influence on global affairs since the end of WWII. 




 My bad homie. 




 Oh well then thanks for doing your part to assure that the site continues to pump out quality content. You're a fucking warrior, bro. 




 Could you imagine everyone else in the world constantly shitting on you? Your country's shit, your country kills babies for oil, your country is full of fat people. Imperial system? Hur hur morons!, etc.

Our pride is a defense mechanism. It started as blind patriotism after WWII, but has since morphed into a defense mechanism. 




 cheers!

 




 Whining about karma is even lamer. 




 If I wasn't friends with anyone who called everyone in my country the worst people in the world I wouldn't have as many friends as I do. Sometimes you have to educate people with wrong views (me in this case), otherwise we're just a constantly divided people fighting over our respective borders and their contents.

I actually like Scotland and have never met a bad person from there, but sometimes when you're drunk and you're challenged on your aggressive drunk comments, you double down instead of correctly accepting your mistakes. 

So here I am, apologizing for the comment I made about your country and countrymen and hoping that we can bury the hatchet in the name of friendship. 




 that's as many people as my city. 




 So... friends? 




 Not ordering enough to have left overs is what's plain wrong. 




 Scotch is good. OK, I coneeded a point, now you need to conceed a point about America.

This is the only way we can grow as people and learn to love each other :)

I'm willing to hang up the hate hat if you are.

Friends? 




 It's pretty standard but a lot of places will also do like "3 meat combo with 2 sides", that kind of thing. Still by weight though. 




 Nothing better than the left over BBQ smorgasbord sandwich the next day.  




 Is a scot really trying to play "whose country has had a greater impact on today's world" with an ignorant yank? Bro, your country peaked in 1298 after the battle of Falkirk. Your most famous cultural attach is Willy the Groundskeeper from an American TV cartoon. Golf is nice to fall asleep to on a Sunday afternoon though, I'll give you that.  




 I'm pretty sure you buy by weight at Franklins. That looks like 1/4 lb of sausage, 1 lb of brisket and 1 lb of ribs. Certainly could be a single serving but just as easily could be for 2-3 people. 

Serving size may vary* 




 My favorite pizza topping is hyperbole :P 




 I'm pretty sure I said something to the effect of "scottish people are the anglo-world's equivalent to the runt of the litter".  




 OMG! He's using a linguistic contraction that developed in a localized culture over a couple hundred years! Let's point out that he's different than me and isolate him because of it! 




 If this is something visitors are concerned about when they visit the states, perhaps it is something that visitors could spend 20 minutes researching before they arrive as to avoid any potential confusion.

I'm know I'm going to learn and respect the cultural and commercial architect of the countries I visit and I expect others to do the same in my country. 




 This is a funny comment because I simply believe that we are different, and get frustrated that the way we do things is considered the "wrong" way. I don't think either system is inherently superior, they boil down to a divergence of extremely trivial cultural developments.

I've never said "not tipping is so STUPID how are you supposed to get good service if the server doesn't have the incentive of a nice tip" nor "including taxes in the sticker price of goods can create a misunderstanding and dissonance between the actual value of goods and their taxed rate".

Meanwhile I responded to a comment saying that "the system of tipping *is* bad, and an established living wage salary without tipping is a superior system", and "america is backwards for not including taxes on their sticker prices".

I was drunk and feisty in my responses, granted. However, even if I was exhibiting the dunning-kruger effect, how were you not? 




  but some things like alcohol, cigarettes, and gas have an additional tax in some counties or cities. 

These taxes are different than sales tax (they're 'vice taxes') and are already added to the price.

For instance, NYC has a very high cigarette tax but the sticker price reflects that from the get go.
 




 lol drunk redditing comes with it's share of hazards I guess :P 




 I dunno. Drunk redditing comes with it's own hazards.

freakin cobweb. 




 Ah the old 'Second Launcher' theory. 




 Right I just think it needed to be bridged better. For instance, "if you made it past child birth your life expectancy increases x amount and if you're male and make it past 21 it increases by x amount more."

Pretty pedantic on my part but how else are you supposed to drunk reddit? 




 Thanks mate and apologies. Drunk and belligerent redditing is good value :P yelling at strangers over inane crap is kind of cathartic in doses, especially when it diverges from your usual MO. 




 "well, and my brother greg." 




 Left Hand Free is like if Alt-J and The Black Keys had a song baby. I like it. Different than their usual sound for sure. 




 The thing with bone injuries, especially ones that severe, is the mental battle as opposed to the physical one. It's gonna be a slug fest against every instinct In his body saying "stop" before he gets to full speed.  




 "You get chased out of restaurants if you don't pay it"

Sounds like a solution to your problem?

"Sales tax vary"

Wahhhh, spend 3 fucking minutes of your trip planning on learning the sales tax of the states you'll be in. Americans get grilled for not being educated towards visited countries and yet we have to deal with this bull shit. 

Fucking god damnit it's not complicated. Fucking Australians are such shit for brains. I can deal with Brits lording over us but fucking Australians? Y'all are the Arkansas of the Anglo world. Honestly Scottish people make y'all look like New Zealanders.  




 I'm extremely empathetic towards suicide and persons who see no answer but it, but suicide can definitely be a 'selfish' act. I can honestly only speak for myself but dealing with depression, accepting it and so forth, the contemplation comes when you have narrowed your field of vision to such a sliver that honestly all you can think about is yourself. "Where do *I* fit in? Who am *I* really? Am *I* really worth it?

That's the thing I think, it's not selfish in the traditional sense of 'taking an extra slice of pizza when there's not enough to go around' but in the 'wow I'm so miserably self absorbed right now'.

But then seeing it first hand and it's reverberation through the person's family and friends; no matter how low I feel, how insignificant and inconsequential, no matter how inward and introspectively down I get,  I can always count on the sudden burst of 3rd person awareness that takes
Me out of me and allows me to not be selfish. 

It's a fucking battle, between you and yourself, where a part
of you that wants to die and it's selfish enough to try to drag the whole with it.  




 I'm just drunk and in the mood to argue to be frank.  




 Ideal circumstances with a light launchee and a heavy launcher and a perfectly inflated (not too full not too empty) blob for sure. The blobs kinda small though and the launcher looks average weight and from a relatively low jump spot.

Source: I blobbed a lot  




 No I know man you just presented your reasoning in a broken way. 




 Bitching about sales tax not being including boggles my mind. Do you honestly add everything up at a grocery store and have an exact figure in your head for what you will be spending, and then if you do, what the fuck is the difficulty with doing some basic multiplication with that basic addition? Y'all just bitch to bitch because it's not what you're used to. Fuck. Seriously infuriating. Y'all act like god came down from the heavens and declared tipping wrong and we're the only ones who ignored his sacred proclamation. You pay 4 fucking times as much for a pizza in Australia verse the US and you twats still have the nerve to whine about an expected *BUT NOT REQUIRED* 15% service charge. Good god you whiney fucking cunts.  




 I think you're under thinking it.  




 10m still isn't 50' ya dumb cobweb.  




 "This is reddit, where I go to postulate." 




 While truish, 50' seems like a "I was there you shoulda seen it"
exaggeration. She looks about 30' tops. Still some serious air. 




 And yet you ingrates still fucking bitch about having to tip on the larger and less expensive meal. 




 Yah but zero is your first name day so 14th name day is 13 years old.  




 You say infant mortality is the reason then you say if you made it past 25.  




 If you made it past infancy you could expect 60-70 more years on average.  




 We beat the Titans once last season doe. It was the last time we won a game. It was almost a year ago. Lol. 




 Dream big or move to Tennessee.  




 Is it crazy that I believe we are going to win more games than we won two seasons ago?

 




 More like a death tarp. 




 I mis-read it as a combination of peanut butter, Nutella and the powder.

Just pictured a bowl of those 3 ingredients with a banana on top. Ta-da! Healthy! 




 Check out seapoint farms roasted edamame products. Great snack because a serving actually fills you up. High in protein and fiber. Wasabi flavor is good and so is lightly salted. 4.5 grams of fat, 14 grams of protein, 7 grams of fiber in 1/4 cup.  




 On the spectrum of pork products it's one of the less healthy choices however.  




 Hummus has protein but it doesn't have a ton of it. Talking like 2 grams per ounce. 




 He said healthy lol. That's like 80% fat and sugar.  




 Or it's a reaction to a helicopter getting shot at. 




 Tilt! 




 Maybe statistically but they were exposed big time when Ibaka was out.  




 My arm-chair meteorologist theory is that Ike left a huge pressure bubble in Texas and as a result storms have been unable to form or move through the area. Seems like it's starting to return to normal. 




 A story on the internet is not admissible evidence in court. 




 Right - just saying that generally there isn't any math to do at the supermarket. 




 I've only ever seen price per ounce unless it's one of those dry food stuffs self bag by weight in which case it's by pound.  




 Should probably incorporate food in there somewhere though! 




 Not that I don't think it's outrageous but how is it *illegal*? 




 When you get your confirmation from uber/lyft you get the drivers name, picture and car make/model/color though? And how would you steal a fare with lyft/ubers system?

Could see this with a taxi service, a la the bone collector though.  




 Actually, a couple years ago the Rockets were the little underdog team that everyone on /r/nba loved. The dichotomy in my interactions on this subreddit between now and then is crazy.  




 How is it entrapment? 




 In the article it mentions conservative/GOP support for uber and lyft.  




 Failing to see the irony.  




 Feel like this will hit harder at home than against it's intended targets. Russians rely on cheap imports which these sanctions will impact. Yes it will hurt the West economically but the quickest way to lose a population's support is to come between them and feeding their families.  




 Yeah I was at the last win last season. Sprained my ankle leaving the stadium. Pretty sure I cursed the team.

Sorry, everyone. 




 *puts on gun*

Actually, *pew pew pew*. 




 True but technically it was also 2-10 at one point. 




 What an awful year for Mr. McNair. 2-10 and a battle with cancer. Glad to hear his health outlook is sunny, hopefully his team follows suit.

Outside of Kraft, there aren't many owners as generous nor humble as McNair. 




 *puts on milking frock*

Actually, tipping a cow causes it's utters to plug themselves due to gravity and general cow stuff, greatly decreasing it's milk output. Though fun, this is not an effective way to milk a cow. 




 You're on the right, right?  




 *tips hat* 




 *Puts on cowboy hat*

Actually, they have both. Most rodeos are attached to livestock shows, of which cows are a big part, with the best ones often out earning the top bull riders for their owners. 




 You're brave for saying that though.  




 Yeah I don't like yellow cab drivers. They're bad at their job. Glad a better service is getting a shot at dethroning a nearly monopolized service. So, kinda the opposite of bitter. 

edit: seems like everyone else here is bitter. 




 You realize you're comparing a movie that hasn't come out to a movie that is out, which is what you were whining about in the first place, brah? 




 Putting words in his mouth. He said he thought Intersteller would be his favorite movie this year, it still is in the running but now it will be competing with GOTG.  




 You could just bookmark it. 




 Well then I guess you'll have a continuing user base once the better product wins over the majority.  




 I meant poor people.  




 Maybe they've updated it since my last use. Regardless, I didn't switch to exclusively uber/lyft because it's a worse service. 

And yes you could enter the address but I was saying that the address service wouldn't be able to find a lot of the addresses I was using. 

And from one anecdote to the other, I constantly had drivers try to swindle cash over card. Sorry bud, you're required by law to have a working credit card machine. 




 HailCab was nicer than calling for a cab but the app pales in comparison to its lyft uber counterparts. It's location service was unreliable and often wouldn't be able to find the address you entered. Compare this to uber/lyft which utilizes GPS (or you can manually enter an address) and you are automatically paired with a driver which you can see in real time in the app. Also I found that every time id ask to pay with a card on hailacab, the driver would claim I put cash even when of show them my confirmation ticket.

It's just a superior service in every way.

Source: I use(d) lyft/uber and yellow cab 4-5 times a week.  




 Or he's just one of those guys that doesn't trust "institutions".  




 A simple solution like a dedicated uber/lyft card similar to transit cards. Honestly though not many people utilize taxis anyways because they're expensive for the mile to dollar. 




 The new Spoon album is soooo good.  




 While I get where you're coming from and kids missing that long *rarely* return home alive; they *never* return home alive if they're found dead. If it's not a hoax she's dead, if it is a hoax she's *maybe* still destined for a happy ending. No matter how small the probability it's still astronomically higher than someone coming back to life. That's why I hope it's a hoax.  




 I mean, I agree, and you say that, but I wonder, how many, side bar pictures are a result of those photog,raphers 




 Nah like a figurative push in the right direction.  




 Curious why Houston is The Netherlands most popular NBA team. Can't think of any Dutch in the NBA and esp. not on the Rockets.  




 "steal" lol. same people who think that's stealing don't think piracy is stealing. 




 Menil Park and check out Rothko Chapel. Great quiet and chill spot.  




 Double Trouble is great. My rail stop is right there and I'll go grab a Drink and chill after work once a week or so. Get a Suffering Bastard.  




 Also Mercantile. Usually way less crowded, good coffee, beer, wine and other treats. Plus they have a swing inside so there's that.  




 I know :(

Ah what could have been. 




 Excuses? They're not excuses, they're reasons.  




 Still would have had to have gotten past (the spurs I think?) in the WCF. 




 Sadder than Derrick Rose tearing his ACL in the playoffs 2 seasons ago only to come back and do it again the following season?

Hope he bounces back this year, he's a humble and hungry super star. He deserves a healthy rest of his career. 




 God I fucking ***LOVED*** Von Wafer. Went so far as to name my indoor soccer team 'Von Wafer'. He came in after T-Mac went down and just fucking balled so hard.

That team had so much fucking swag it made swaggy p look like just regular p. Artest, Scola, Lowry, Wafer, Hayes, Yao, LANDRY, Fucking DEKE!, Battier.

Honestly think if T-Mac was healthy, Deke didn't end have a career ending playoff injury, and Yao was healthy (though he finished the series with the Lakers) they would have gone to the finals. Shoot I think even with just a healthy Deke in the Lakers series we could have pulled off the upset (took them to 7).

That team and the 22-win streak team the year before have a very special spot on my heart. What made me grow to truly love basketball as a fan. 




 Easier for the viewer to differentiate if each one has something decidedly unique about them (although they seemed to do that by making them all such different ethnicities).  




 Assuming he's talking about soy milk.  




 All smaller chains/independent stores are more expensive. I have a Starbucks and an independent store close to me. Independent store is 3.00$ for what costs 2.50$ at Starbucks (iced coffee). Granted the independent store is higher quality but outside of the gas station you're not gonna find a cheaper(cost) regular brewed coffee. Starts getting expensive when you order coffee milk shakes but those are expensive everywhere.  




 Mourning has been. Curiosity got the best of me. Just him, Hardaway and MJ.   




 Do the Heat have any retired numbers of their own? Alonzo Mourning? Hardaway?  




 I don't like you anymore.
