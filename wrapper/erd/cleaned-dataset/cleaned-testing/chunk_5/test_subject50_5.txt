 Fewer threats does not mean more secure 




 After working in college tech support for students, I found that Macs were not more secure, just malware writers didn't give a fuck about them because they couldn't make as much money because there weren't enough of them. That slowly changed during my time there and we had to figure out how to remove viruses on a Mac, which didn't have anti-malware like Malwarebytes 




 The short answer: no because the air is so dense that the ship would burn up. Also they don't go up as much as horizontal in the end from what I've heard

The long answer I'll leave to an aerospace engineer or someone of that expertise 




 FTL and the Binding of Isaac are 2 of my favorite, more modern ones 




 I saw that. He's been spot on with a lot of stuff lately. 




 Sounds more like a voting problem to me 




 Did RoosterTeeth's success with getting a film funded influence your decision to go this route and use IndieGoGo (at all and vs another crowdfunding source)? 




 I'd say industrial hygienists are safe (workplace safety) but that can possibly be included in HVAC as they do a lot with ventilation 




 Nadella is much better. Get users using it on any mobile device, then they need the paid for version on their computer. Which costs money, ATM. 




 Sorry, this is long, but here goes:

Recent grad here, just finished my PhD in Biosystems Engineering and found a job in industry (on the other side of the country, it's snowing. It's not supposed to snow in March.)

Anyway, I probably had a very different graduate school experience than you are having, but let me tell you about what I do. During my undergraduate time I started working with my advisor (academic) and told him I was more interested in working in industry than academia. I continued to work for him as an undergraduate for about 2 years before getting my BS. I was planning to go to graduate school. That was always part of the plan.

The work I ended up doing in his lab my senior year ended up carrying into my graduate degree and that helped me get through it a little quicker. My first year I had some crazy hours. Shitty pay, that never improved. One calendar year I received a full graduate student in engineering stipend. After that year, I settled into a rhythm a bit and got started on a new project. Which was good, as I was over the one that had carried on from undergrad.

After about 2 years on that project I was fucking done with it too. It was going nowhere. Another guy in my lab had been working on something similar for about a year before I started and his seemed to work better (from a fundamentals thing as I was working the alternative design). Finally we got enough data (we thought) to publish mine and that would represent my 3rd paper (I'm leaving one out because it was a side project that ended up working really well.) My committee decided I should graduate in the middle of June and I defended at the end of July. July sucked. A lot. All during this my advisor was very results oriented. He knew we got paid for 20 hours. He didn't care if it took us 10 hours a week of work to get something done if the results were real and what we were hoping for. Sitting around reading meaningless papers is a waste of time

I eventually found a job while working on some random stuff in my lab and helping them move from one building to the next. I was lucky, my advisor was willing and able to pay me.

The new job, me in a totally different climate, going from hot as balls to cold as fuck has been very different for me. There still are proposals, but your role in that can be as much or as little in the writing process as you want. Backing up a little, I work for a small company now that relies largely on SBIR grants and that sort of thing. The goal is to use one or more of these to get something that works to market and sell infinity and drop the mic. It scares me a little (scared me moving 1800 miles) but they're attached to a slightly larger company that's been more stable as they've been around for 30+ years. Now, at my new company, I'm expected to work 40 hours per week. Not 9-5 or whatever, just 2 weeks that average 40 hours. I have a ton of flexibility with my schedule. Meetings are expensive, especially when there are 7 PhDs present.

A few things to keep in mind:
Your advisor sounds crazy. I have a friend in BME who has an advisor a bit like yours (mostly with the random fucking e-mails). Basically you have to get across to him that you plan to do what he asks, in a reasonable time frame. Him expecting you to have work done at 11 that he asked about at 9 on a Sunday is not a reasonable time frame. If it were a weekday, sure, maybe.
2-3 meetings a day is incredibly inefficient. Do everything you can to cut that back to like once per week for 2 hours if necessary.
Why do you feel the need to keep the same hours as him? He gets paid a lot more than you do. You get paid for 20 hours/week (usually). Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that you need to get your work done to graduate, BUT without killing/burning yourself out.
In my experiences working with PhDs from industry (we got more industry backed funding than anything else), you get a bit of both worlds. You have some who absolutely dont take their work home and some who obsess over it. Both are successful.

TL;DR: Post academia can be pretty much what you want it. I had a reasonable advisor and managed to find a job that gives me flexible scheduling. Your advisors an asshat who doesnt know how to manage people. 

Start looking for a job now. Dont necessarily tell him cause he might freak out
 




 True story. Mine got boosted from 50 to 100 mbps and only cost like $60 with cox 




 too bad we can't/haven't sent a telescope/explorer with the imaging quality of Hubble out that far (or have we and they just operate differently where the one we sent takes one picture while Hubble uses lots to make this image?)

Could get better pictures that way, not that these are bad 




 I recently moved from Arizona to Ohio. It's good. This shift is meaningless, though at the moment I'd prefer "savings time" rather than standard time just because it's not quite sundown when I go home around 5.
