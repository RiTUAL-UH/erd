 Potato backwards!

 No.  I can't willingly make myself fart anytime I want.  I'm pretty sure I would shit myself if I tried. 




 Toilet paper.  It will be replaced with three sea shells... 




 A failing marriage. 









 [Hmmm...](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/70/707e91a2cf8af3bdc2382f2ab0c88bc6c3df9924f4db80ce9464956d399d5a13.jpg) 




 Good or bad. 




 I could see this continuing as a series. 




 Not too bad for your first time. I liked the alien aspect. 




 If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello". 




 Hmmm, I bet you're one of them there left Twix eatin' sum bitches... 




 They don't necessarily have to cheat the people.  Just advertise that it is part of a healthy diet, because it is half the calories of a normal package of Twix and sell it for half the price.  
  
Boom. 




 If you keep the number of Twix the same in the packaging, then you would have left Twix and lefter Twix...and right Twix and righter Twix. 
  
No need to start a civil war inside of an already raging civil war, is there? 




 If they don't call themselves "Juggalos", it's time to riot in the streets. 














 I got it now.  I posted a WP earlier today and then saw that the first reply got deleted and responded to by the bot.  
  
Here I was thinking that the first person didn't like their story after they submitted it or something. 




 Dat wink, doe. 




 [I could see that.](http://media.giphy.com/media/fJoFlIydxlfXO/giphy.gif) 














 Why is that called a farmer turn? 




 Sounds like a great driving mantra to have stenciled on my car visor. 














 Should've shot him in the knee as soon as he bought it, to give his purple heart some weight. 









 Til my mom walks down the hall...

When she sees me, starts to bawl. 




 That is so fucking strange! When I posted this question, that song was in my head. 




 That seems like a lot of pressure. 




 Maybe its ass was whipped by Winamp... 









 If you're going to be royalty, you have to learn to [shut your mouth](http://i.imgur.com/MdjmzjJ.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/MdjmzjJ.jpg).

 A little life advice for you then...don't become a K-5 teacher.  Those sick little, information-seeking, cute-when-they're-not-yours bastards will hug you as they foam at the mouth and think everything is fine.  
  
"I love you Mr. ____!"  
  
*proceeds to try and hug you*  
  
Yeah, back the fuck up. 




 "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world..." 




 I played disc golf back in college. One time at the course, I threw my disc and it came to a stop, leaning against a wooden fence post. I guess I wasn't paying much attention when I leaned over to grab it and I ended up sliding my middle finger down the grain of the post.

I ended up with a 2 inch splinter of wood being jammed up my middle fingernail...all the way. I had to go to the nearest urgent care facility to get shots in my finger and get it pulled out with tiny tweezers.

If I had any secrets that someone wanted to know at that time, I would have yelled them at the top of my lungs. 




 If someone tickles me, it makes me angry.

You wouldn't like me when I'm tickled...err...angry. 




 What if the torturer gave you an option of sugar cone or chocolate-dipped waffle cone for your eyeball afterwards? Would that help any? 







































 Oh yeah? Well, I just had sex with your girlfriend!

Since your statement was a little off, I figured the reply should be too. 




 Thor is pretty tight with Heimdall, and that dude can see EVERYTHING. 









 Maybe he's going by the DVORAK calendar layout. 




 Mom?

 All that I do, is not enough for you. 









 Yes. 









 Ok...he's never *seen* me see his trouser wonder, from down under. 




 Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew. 




 Why not? I'm too lazy to look that up. 




 Small is in the eye of the beholder.

I'm sure midgets wouldn't find it small...or maybe they would.

I've never seen your penis. 




 Just another movie of his where he would inexplicably get to mack on a beautiful actress. (Bridgette Wilson, Courtney Cox, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, Brooklyn Decker, Jennifer Aniston, etc.) 




 You know what they say...the bigger the berry, the sweeter the juice. 
























 [Gimmie a break](https://youtu.be/e4EAGiefnxc). 









 That was an amazing answer. Now, I want a monkey. 









 The scene in The Patriot when Mel Gibson's character is about to ride off to fight in a battle and he asks his daughter (who is traumatized from earlier events and hasn't spoken since) to give him just one word before he goes. She refuses, he goes to hug her, and she pulls away. As he's riding away, she stares him down and then says "Papa!". He jumps off his horse and runs to her. She says "I'll say anything, just please don't go" and hugs him.

I cry like someone has just replaced their testicles with onions and then teabagged my face for two and a half hours. 




 For every clown, there is a nightmare. 




 Asshole. 




 A person born blind. 




 That's really fucked up. Sorry. How has your life turned out? 









 ...love.
