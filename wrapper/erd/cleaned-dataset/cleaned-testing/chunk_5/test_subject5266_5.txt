 Systems that organically integrate with the world helps this.


3 traits help combat? not necessary, have 1. Its one clear system.

But maybe theres a platforming system so tie a trait to that.

Maybe there's a dialogue system - another trait.

Make them distinct and related to a single system, then design a game that really interweaves those systems.

Instead of interweaving traits in skills that stack up over one system:

E,g. Combat = int, agi, str, const etc.
Dialogue = cha, int, str, 




 Is it coming to pc? 




 Tetris music was amazing back in the day. Loved listening to it :P 




 I am so glad I had MGS4 already installed when I went to play it again today :P 




 ah ok, just saw it in the film and wondered if the lettering was deliberate 




 I made a video about this sort of topic recently and it uploaded just today! Specifically related to physical contact with NPC's (non-violent contact).

I love little details in games! Makes them so much more immersive and varied in the experience. 









 Can't wait for this on PC, I think it's really cool how much they are changing up for fans as well as new console players. 




 Just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words, I'd thank you all individually but I don't want to spam the thread. Really glad I could communicate a different way of tackling it. 




 Haha, wow, thanks I think!

 Hes a tragic villain, but becoming the monster we see hinted at in the games is still becoming a villain. Even Solid Snake didnt see himself as a hero. His father with his PMC and his vendetta against the world that fucked him doesn't make him anything remotely good.

Can't wait to see it unfold though, each game he's gotten worse and worse this is gunna be really fucking sad and horrific. Even sadder when you see what his mentor chose in peacewalker. 














 Big Boss is turning into the villain though, so it's likely his character arc will make more sense to play more lethally. There may even be forced killing missions??

I'm okay with that given we are playing a character we KNOW is a villain and the series has always said something interesting and critical about war. It's not got the jingoistic tone of say, Splinter Cell Blacklist. 









 The guy is a master of languages, I'm sure he could pick up Polish for a Witcher film. 




 He really is a great choice, I totally agree with you. Stunning actor and he's not typical American/British/Australian choices you might see for this kind of film.
