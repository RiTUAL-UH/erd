Damn, she's old. 




 How can someone not love Baymax! :D 




 Saw Big Hero 6 :D I absolutely loved it! 




 That Nexus is certainly fake. Nothing happens to a real Nexus. 




 Not Hangouts

 For me, the most refreshing drink is water :P 




 Not knowing how our Lord's name is pronounced. 




 Yes!
 




 I just used that casually, not like a sad thing :) 




 None of my friends use it... 




 DuARTe is all forgiving. 




 No. I don't. 




 Yes, I do think of it as an art... 




 He told me on /r/India once... 




 I just don't listen to it. 




 By tunes like that, I mean that it's the only one I rarely listen to... 




 I am just not interested in it... 




 There used to be a time when I did like it, but later I just lost interest... But very rarely, I do listen to soothing tunes like 'Come September'... 




 But Material is the latest, and should be loved more. 




 Ummm... I don't really think so... I attribute it more to the fact that I anever really had any interest in music, I always preferred to do something else rather than listening to music...  




 Thank God, I am not alone! 




 butters up


Don't insult Project Butter! 




 Then make it Materialification Nation! 




 I love Disney movies! 




 Something that I just don't do... I don't know why, but I never listned to it. 




 I am going to watch Tangled now on my laptop :) 




 Is music really that necessary? 




 That's even hard to imagine for me, never ecxperienced it... So, what are you planning to do now? 




  There have been droughts in areas around my city as well. And the droughts here are bad. Like, water only once a day for the villages. But the cities get a consistent water supply. 




 No, the rains are okay here... What about your place? 




 No. I don't listen to radio, and there's no elevator music here... 




 I hope rain comes here, too :D 




 At 106 even the AC feels ineffective :( 




 85 is really good :) 




 Yeah, it's kinda good here... What's the temperature at your place? 




 And that's what you've RES tagged me as well... :P 




 India... 




 That's the normal summer temperature here... 




 Yes, no music at all... 




 41C/106F :'( 




 Well... I don't listen to music, so people find me weird... 




 It's horribly hot here :( 




 I am too damn bored today... 




 But getting rarer :( 




 Yeah, Mountain Dew is refreshing, but I try to stay away from such drinks... 




 Drinking cold water. It's the best way to relax :P 




 India. Horribly hot here. 41C/106F. 




 Thanks for the info! 




 You can flash ROMs? Does the iOS bootloader allow that? 




 But you cannot flash ROMs/Kernels on a jailbroken iPhone...  




 But a rooted Android can provide much more functionality than a jailbroken iPhone... 




 Tigers! 




 BUT YOU SWITCHED TO  CYANOSHIT! 




 2 days... Not more than that... 




 Truth! 









 I feel like it's a waste of time and energy... 




 I've never watched. And I never plan to. 




 An AOSP ROM on the S6 might be better... 




 But still, it cannot match the versatility of Stock Android... 




 The skin which Samsung puts over Android...  




 TouchWiz is bad.  




 If you plan a road trip, do visit Kashmir, especially Leh. It has some stunning scenery, and challenging roads. And don't miss the Taj Mahal! 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 It would work only if the sweetener was a lollipop... 




 India. 




 So you deem yourself worthy enough to be in the same list which contains the holy Hitler? 




 But you are not an Approved Prophet! 




 Never been to any country except mine :( 




 It's Monday here :( 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 No, bratfrombrad 




 Same here! 




 No problem :) 




 Sure! I will post it ( If I don't forget :P ) 




 Yeah, the ones like "I just found this sub AMA" are getting boring... 














   You have disgraced Lord DuARTe. 




 Ladfrombrad? You mean shillfrombrad! 




 Computer games? 




 What kind of games? 




 Nothing much to do currently... :( 




 I literally haven't done anything today, so it might be cycling... 




 Truth! 




 Shitler


**HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 using WhatsCrapp and Shittyfy

**MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS** 




 Giving lesser respect to DuARTe's latest work. 




 Not renaming Holofication Nation to Materialification Nation. 




 My school has a website, but it's horrible, and hasn't ever been updated... 




 My school only has an SMS system for important messages... 




 /uj Your school has an app? Most Indian schools don't... 




 Mmmm... I don't know much about dog breeds :) 




 I probably would have a dog :) 




 There's no place in my house for pets to fit... (I dont have a balcony :(  ) 




 30 cats!!!! What's did you keep them? Did they fit in your house? Also, I have no pets :) 




 'Cause they are infected by TouchJizz... 




 XD... So, how many cats do you have? 




 I know, such timings are really bad :'( I once had to skip my science paper because of a horrible cold... 




 This year I had a bad cold before my history paper. It was bad :( 




 Yeah, I know :D I am always down with a cold :P 




 Even I am just lying in my bed right now :). Down with a cold? 




 Hey, what's up? 




 I'm from Maharashtra in India. Just finished my 10th grade exams... 




 Hi! I'm from India and I am a student.
