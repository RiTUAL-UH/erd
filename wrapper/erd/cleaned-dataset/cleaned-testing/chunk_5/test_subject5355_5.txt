 The name sounds familiar, but I can't seem to find it with a yellow layout in the early 2000s. Perhaps I used this too. 




 I read your post history and man, you sound lonely and depressed. This might sound weird, but where do you live? I'll be your friend if by sheer chance we live nearby - or at least give you an honest shot and put up with your awkwardness (for all I know you're an asshole :p).

 Why is this getting downvoted? Not only does gender effect social perception on virginity at that age, but also the statistics show that there is a difference between proportions of virgins in each gender. 









 This might also be further exacerbated by deliberately picking smarter/more studious children and adults who are less interested in general knowledge. 




 This. Oftentimes I get a little annoyed I can't remember something I know I knew a long time ago. 




 Videogame website: It was a website for videogame cheats, popular in the early 2000s. One of my main alternatives to GameFAQs. It had a yellow layout at the time and I strongly believe had "cheats" in its title.

Where's Wally: I've seen mirrors of this screamer since then, however I'm specifically looking for a webpage/site that hosted this and ALSO had a hatemail section where people sent in their grievances after having been tricked by the screamer.

 Is Dr. Phil really exploiting anyone? I think people know they aren't going to go on the show and get proper psychiatric treatment. But Phil usually sets them up with a professional at the end of the episode. They go on and air their dirty laundry and in exchange get free psychiatric help.

 I hate the slippery slope argument to be honest.

Would you be saying the same for abortions? Would you be saying the same for euthanasia? Everything is 'on a slope' already, you've got to draw it somewhere. And it most cases, it's already drawn too close to the conservative side. Let's do a little line shifting. 




 Dude, that's literally everyone. No one is going to think you have low self-esteem.

Look at any young couple: the majority of them are within the same 'attractiveness' range. It gets a bit distorted as people get older (limited options, being together for a long time and one partner letting themselves go, etc) but generally it holds true. 




 What the fuck? Why is this even upvoted? Nice figure, great tits, great ass, cute face. What is wrong with you? 




 I think part of the joke was that 'nice guys' tend to vilify attractive people. If he's good looking or works out he must be a jerk in their minds. I think it's suiting.

It adds to the comic because the whole nice guy mentality is that girls overlook nice guys for good looking jerks. But... Maybe the good looking guy is the real nice guy.

 Dude, they're subsidiaries of a larger company, they'd have completely different management, ethics, corporate culture, etc.

 It doesn't take much imagination to see how overlooking this sort of thing will lead to sex trafficking.

This is a non-issue in Australia where prostitution is perfectly legal. All it's lead to is much, much safer sex, since prostitutes need to be medically examined consistently and operate out of licensed venues.

 He said what WOULD happen, not what should happen. Let's be realistic: there is nothing wrong with the ad with the current genders or if they were switched, but the uproar would be much greater if the roles were reversed. 




 That is a global average, so it's probably bought down by underdeveloped countries. Average in the United States is 5.6 inches.

Even then, that surprises me. Not trying to brag, I'm only 6 inches, but I guess I always expected mine to be below average since I'm really short. 




 Can you provide an actual citation?

You make it sound like the male and female brains are completely distinct though. Isn't it more of a continuum. If so, where do you draw the line for 'feminine male who wishes he was a female' and 'male who actually has a female brain'?

 He provided the sperm for free.

Edit: I guess I'm getting downvoted because I wasn't clear enough. Consideration is required by both parties for a contract to be considered legally valid. Because he donated the sperm for free, it is not considered a valid contract. What he signed is not legally binding. 




 are mosquitoes pointless enough that it's okay to eradicate them anyway, if we don't have a way to eradicate just the malaria?

And the answers seem to be yes, and we don't. They spread a lot more diseases than just malaria too 




 The point he is making is we can eliminate malaria, and still address the overpopulation problem by helping to develop the rest of the world. 




 We eradicate diseases. You have no problem with curing AIDS, I'm guessing? So why not eliminate malaria too? Because that's what they're trying to do. There has not been any evidence put forward that this would have a negative consequence beyond the non-existence of a pretty weird insect. 




 Do you have any sources or anything at all to back up your claims? Any expert I've heard speak on the subject has pretty much said they have no positive impact on any ecosystem. 




  Back then, an obese lady/man was considered attractive, not because of reproduction instinct, but because it represented wealth and status.

This is outright contentious, there is no academic consensus. Yes, fat people might have been more SOUGHT after. This does not make them more ATTRACTIVE. A supermodel hanging off the arms of an 80 year old billionaire, with 50 other girls after him, isn't necessarily more sexually appealing than a normal, young guy with just five girls after him. They could be willfully overlooking how repulsive he is for the money.

I guess this comes down to the definition of attractive, but I believe we're talking physical here.

Also, as specific traits become less correlated with wealth/power (fat people and skinny people are in all classes), these things matter less. I wonder if we care more about our 'primal' attractions now than for most of recorded history. 




 and the fat chicks were the supermodels.

This is highly overstated and only arguably true for some societies in very small periods of time. More importantly though, it's the result of the implications of their fat. Fat = wealth.  It's hard to even argue that it's attraction (more like fat people being more desirable for their wealth, while their suitors pretended to find them attractive to get in good with them). There's a lot of debate around this among historians.

More on point though, as society grows and everyone has access to the same food and exercise choices, the same medicine and the quality of life increases across the board, it might become more normal to play of our basic instincts of attraction rather than societal standards. If most mind find large eyes on women attractive because of a natural response, then it's unlikely to see that disappear without some highly unpredictable shaking up of social order. 

1,000 years is a long time, but if the quality of life keeps improving and physical attributes continue to correlate less strongly with wealth/power, it's hard to see that happening.

 Small businesses want to protect their brand too. An ice cream store in my hometown had a very identifiable name and made amazing ice cream you couldn't get elsewhere. Their name was used by a competitor in one of our major cities, without permission of the owner's. When the owners went to expand into the city, they were thought to be the knockoff. They managed to force the other store to change their name eventually though. 




 Cold call electricians. If they say they can't do it, ask if there is someone they know who can or if a different profession might fill this request.

You could also call the manufacturer of the grills and ask who supplies the heat coils (they make not make their own) and then contact them and ask for a custom made one. They probably won't take small orders but it's worth a shot. 




 It's not hard to understand. What point are you trying to make? What physicists have you been speaking to that can't understand that?

 Why can't they just test the strength of the balls in the first place? Why can't the balls be supplied by the league officials instead of teams? 




 Regarding the 40% cut, do they often inflate the amount you are suing for to account for the lawyers fee, or are you just automatically 40% out of whatever you should have got if someone commits a crime against you?

For example, if I'm suing someone for damaging my car for $10,000, will I sue for $14,000 to cover lawyers fees, or do I pretty much have to accept that the moment damage is done to my car that I'm at best getting 60% of it back?

I'm not sure if you'd even need a lawyer for the car example, so if not replace it with something you would need a lawyer for. 




 The law prevents you from making any statements that would incite public panic.

The entire crux of that joke is based on the fact that he knew the listening audience would interpret it as being a dangerous gas.

Yes, it's stupid that people don't do a quick Google search to see that he's joking. But he made the joke PRECISELY knowing that they wouldn't.

It doesn't matter if it's true or not from a legal perspective: make a statement intended to incite panic  face the punishment. 




 Tax seems like the easiest to get a job in due to a ton of small Tax firms in my area, but I have been considering auditing too. Basically, I'm going to see where Grad programs take me, they tend to give you a rotation across various fields. If I don't get one, I'll probably get into Tax.

Good point about the auditing though, makes me feel a little better.

 Struggled with anxiety all through my teens and early 20s. I'm 24 and graduating midsemester. I've improved dramatically (only get specific anxiety trigger now, rather than the constant feeling of dread and unwillingness to leave my house). 

However, one thing I haven't had much area improving on is formal/professional interaction. I feel I may be a bit too laid back, and what few attempts I've had to interact professionally have always been a bit awkward (not knowing when to shake someone's hand, or wrap up a conversation, my voice gets really weak and quiet randomly in conversation's I'm not comfortable with, not good at saying stuff like "nice to meet you" because I just throw it out in random places for some reason).

I know it's weird, but I just go from 'fake it til you make it' mode that I put on in casual meeting to 'complete awkward mode' once a level of formality is introduced. Probably a fear of being judged?

Anyway, the important question: how do I get over this bump? I feel like it's my last step towards feeling good about my future. 




 Damn, never heard any of that. What a player. 




 Those are ports of recent remakes though. I'd imagine porting a Playstation game to PC all these years later would be much more difficult than porting a 3DS game that was released within the last 5 years.

 but on the side he got the best poon Hollywood had the offer.

Huh, I remember recalling in some behind the scenes Seinfeld stuff that he wasn't really involved with women during most of Seinfeld's run, then he got married towards the end. I think that's exactly what sparked the gay rumors in fact.

 In his explanation of the events, he says that that seat was reserved so it was obvious she was trying to get attention.

I think he just acknowledged her because he new if he didn't, she'd interrupt more anyway.

 Creature building also was entirely meaningless. Many were expecting it to affect things like chances of survival and actually requiring you to build a ,functional creature  




 Right. But what does quitting resolve? You just lose yourself a job. The simple fact is, to an extent, they can lie and you can either take it or quit. 




 What kind of job would help you get experience in programming though? That really feels more like something you'd learn at Uni though or by yourself, right? I'm not in IT so I'm not contradicting you, just curious.

Also is programming more specialized? Or are you just talking about very fundamental programming? 




 So if I miss the tree I go to prison? 




 My best guess: we won't find out. People speculated for months about how Sherlock killed himself and we didn't get an answer. I'm guessing we'll get the same with Moriarty. 




 I find this hard to believe, but will happily be proven wrong. My main issue with this is the fact that if it were so cheap, why doesn't a competitor just slash 5k off his car and get all the market share. Eventually other businesses would react and cars would be cheap. Product differentiation only answers part of the story, there would surely be huge markets for cheap high quality cars.

Is it possible whoever told you this failed to factor in marketing, administration, sales %, salaries, R D, etc?

An alternative to OP: it's a promotion expense or they're making money on average by getting people through the door and buying other things with their free item 




 Wait, what happened? 




 Maybe your girlfriend has a loose ass 




 That's /r/fantheories for you 




 There's also the fact that his friends were about to be shot, perhaps Sherlock just quickly wanted to make the call to Watson and save everyone ASAP. 




 So let me get this straight: you're suggesting that Moriarty, at the climax of his plan, among all the emotion and tension in the air, just suddenly goes "wait a minute, I want out lol".

And on top of that, Sherlock just willfully let's the criminal who is about to kill his friends go, despite already having a plan to fake his death that would save his friends anyway (ie. he doesn't need to co-operate with Moriarty in the first place. There is no reason for it).

I really believe Moriarty just straight up faked his death and pulled the wool over everyone's eyes the same way Sherlock did. I would not be surprised if Moffat pulls the same stunt of not explaining how he did it either.

 Correlation =/= causation, you're right. However you're being retarded if you think you can use that claim to dismiss basic reasoning. There is no definite word on why he left Twitter because Joss hasn't spoken up. And even if he did, he could very well lie in order to keep things 'cool'.

What we can do it speculate, weigh the evidence and form conclusions. It seems like he left Twitter precisely because of the backlash.

You could post that stupid picture in response to any number of commonly held beliefs about historical events or figures too, by the way. They're often based on finding evidence based on the timing of events (eg. seeing the rise of iron coinciding with the fall of the Minoan civilization has linked the two, even with no direct evidence). A smart person does not fall for the correlation = causation fallacy. A smart person also doesn't use correlation =/= causation to dismiss evidence and reasoning.

But this is all greatly overanalysing. We're talking about a man quitting Twitter. Around the time he was getting attacked, over a subject he has expressed great personal belief over. It's not a leap to conclude that those two events are linked.

 This is why we have boxing gloves.

If you're suggesting that boxes gloves aren't designed with damage the face in mind, I think you'll find you're wrong. What that common TIL often leaves out is that the gloves distribute the blow of the punch more evenly, leading to less facial damage than if the gloves were smaller. It's part of the design to not damage the face too much while also enabling you to hit the face in the first place.
