 Trying out for the next [Madagascar movie](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/you_didnt_see_anything_madagascar.gif) 




 LMAO thanks for those! 




  But I guess in the end, Ignorance is Bliss.

I agree, the instant gratification that has seeped into of all types of games these days has really tarnished the genre.  
I'm actually going back to pen and paper until (hopefully) this mess blows over.

 That escalated quickly

 While I'd like to hopium, I doubt many of the little nuances from EQ1 make it into 'next-gen' MMOs.  
Things like Languages, Sense heading, NPCs that can charm you, Spell fragment research, Tracking, mobs that try to run when they're low on health, etc. 




 Straw hat crew :) 




 Nope, didn't know you were tweeting about this. 




 Can we talk about why [Dark Elves](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/everquestnext/images/7/74/EQNConceptDEMale.jpg)  dont need horns next? /s 




 No way about it, this hasn't been good for the game/franchise.  
When they spend pretty much all of the [Landmark Live broadcast](http://www.twitch.tv/landmarkgame/v/3801401) trying to explain 'it's going to be ok', it's depressing. I've been through cuts like that, it takes time, like mourning a lost friend, to recover.

 They only waited a week before layoffs.   
I'd expect to hear what games are going to get shuttered by the end of the month. 




 But all those 2013 E3 best in show awards for EQN... 




 Also [@Tenma_EQNL mentions him](https://mobile.twitter.com/Tenma_EQNL/status/565669663737413634) 




 Everything feels so rushed compared to other take-overs I've seen or been apart of. They don't even have an official logo and their website still has SOE all over it. It doesn't leave positive feelings for the future of the studio. 




 Associate Producer for EQN 




 Eric "Felgon" Smith gone as well
