 i'm going to wild a guess and say i'm not your flavor, unless you like XY. 




 Bloc Party, Mykki Blanco, Zebra Katz, The Magic Numbers, Cazwell, Jeffree Star, pretty sure Peter Doherty (Babyshambles, The Libertines) is bi. But that could just be wishful thinking.

 I knew a drummer named Steve

We were in a band till I made leave

His exgirlfriend was in a fury

And called me in a scurry 

To tell me he liked to be called Eve

 uhhhh no. Secel lives in a protected habitat. Trust. 




 Whenever I groom a puppy, I start talking to myself, "It is **SOOO** hard to be a puppy, isn't it mamas? Life is **SOOOOOO** hard." 









 Subspecies* but yeah please! I'd love to see a source, extinction is terribly disheartening, any glimmer of hope is grand.

 .... The fire that also lit one of her dogs on fire. She ran to a liquor to try to put out the flame/gasoline/whatever. The liquor store attendant called the cops. 




 AdBlock? 




 Little backstory: So I groom dogs and have worked on countless beagles. I've heard from owners that their dogs used to be used for medical testing, and I always wondered why, why beagles. Of all dogs, why them. 

Answer? They are really nice and compact.

 ...Wut?

These look like garbage. Put your clipper on low, and train your dog proper. Use a cell phone on vibrate. A back massager. An electric tooth brush. Work up to a clipper on low without using it, just having it on. Baby steps.

Sorry to sound so harsh, but this isn't the victorian age, my dear.

Edit: I have ONCE seen these on a dog grooming group, but no one even used them. They are antiques from a bygone era.

 Odd, they seem like a hugely popular group to be on here. 



















 I can get [down](http://img.pandawhale.com/108469-homer-simpson-thats-my-fetish-CvAn.gif) with that. 




 That's dangerous, puppies eat most anything :( 




 I quit drinking and doing drugs over a year ago. I had liver failure and other stuff. For a 24 year old, I should be dead. 




 that's hot.

 I met my boyfriend on CL. He brought me a giant jar of weed. In public. In front my apartment. On the street.

I rushed him inside. And yeah we've been dating ever since. (year and 3 months or something?) I no longer smoke, but it's a funny memory. 




 OH MY GOD.

I just watched *From Hell* with Jonny Depp and feel like i have to tell everyone.

Also *Se7en*.

Neither of these are cheesy horror, but freaking weird thrillers with horror elements.

K. I'm done. 




 The worst sound is fucking styrofoam or a cardboard box rubbing against itself.

The best sound is a [puppy....for sure a puppy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvlCRbRdC30)

 I *won't* believe it's not butter. 




 Hey man, i love my Crocs for grooming dogs. It keeps my feet from getting soggy when I bathe puppies all day :D

 There's a zoo next to my apartment, so during the night, I hear [gibbons calling out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98ZpAC1PnE). I personally love it.

 I don't much care for Cher living here. Not that she did anything wrong, I just don't care for her. 




 Errgh.... Uzbekistan..... YOUR COTTON PRODUCTIVITY RATES AREN'T EVEN THAT PROFITABLE. *incoherent mumbling while storming off*  




 I love the GLBT section on Netflix, that'd be a cool idea. 









 Most of its habitat, they are extinct in most of their habitat.

You are a snarky little guy, aren't you 3 









 Bitches (female dogs) [and many other animals] will eat the dead puppies that are birthed at pregnancy. It's suggested it's to regain lost nutrients from the pregnancy.

Some times bitches will just not take to the puppy and eat the puppy dead or alive. Mastiffs have a propensity to swollen teets. If a puppy clamps down on one, she could 'disown' her puppy, prey instinct comes in to play, and she will eat her puppy. 




  most of it's habitat

see 2nd source 




 Major international news source and IUCN  Wikipedia. Most academics would agree. 




 I understand completely. I was just trying to point out that my title was still true and verified by a few sources. I think the mod just thought she was being helpful, when, just in my opinion, it wasn't needed.

edit: also? I don't think wikipedia is a great source? but whatever. 









 Ugh Horsetooth Reservoir in Fort Collins makes me so sad with all the graffiti.  




 ... do most gharials make it in to adulthood? And isn't there a monsoon season.. every year?

But again, thanks for more information from wikipedia! 




 For the 'facts' I gave, this doesn't apply. But wikipedia is always nice. Thanks.

 She was truly an inspiration to my entire family. I hope she did as well, I like to think she did. 









 He makes hundreds of thousands of dollars in makeup sponsorships and classes, also touring for his albums and promoting other artists. So yeah, to some, he's very much still a "thing". 




 I'm going to guess... this... is in the wrong sub. 









 Well said, and +666 points for the username.

Earthbath flea and tick orange shampoo, seriously, Espree is garbage compared to this stuff. It's amazing. 




 YES it's called a [miracle brush](http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Coat-Slicker-Brush-Large/dp/B000QFQFTY), buy this, it will make your life better.

Also, while you're at it, invest in a greyhound comb. It has two sides. Use the wide toothed side to find matts, which you shave out with a clipper with a #10 blade. The fine toothed side will be used to check your work. DO NOT USE THIS TO DEMATT. Also, DON'T USE SCISSORS TO DEMATT. (I yelled this, I actually yelled this).

Next, for double coated dogs, i use a [Furminator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040QQ07C/ref=amb_link_411281542_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_s=center-3 pf_rd_r=1Z56KSWBNPYGAMPQEFR2 pf_rd_t=101 pf_rd_p=1776751902 pf_rd_i=1296335011) and a [Zoom Groom](http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Zoom-Groom-Choose-color/dp/B000RGKU7K). Furminator is a blade. Don't do the same area for too long, your dog will get skin irritation. It gets out the undercoat. The zoom groom is good for top coat, and the dogs love how it feels.

Hope some of this helps.

I would also look in to mobil groomers to come to your house. You may have to drop $100, but it'll be worth it. Promise. We professionals know best. 




 Gazelle sighthounds are found all across the middle east and northern Africa. The Indian Gazelle hound,  the Saluki, the Afghan hound, even the island hounds of the Mediterranean like the Ibizan hound. Iran wouldn't surprise me as the origin of such domestication, but the greater differentiation is attributed to the northern Africans. 




 They are from Madagascar, perfect companion dogs for the hot weather with light feather like coats and reflective color. They do well on the high seas as well, probably how they got to the Malagasy and french nobility. 




 They were developed in Boulder, Colorado.

 Geriatric- elderly

I work with dogs, so we say that a lot.

And humpback whales fuck like once in a millennia times a googolplex. I imagine older humpbacks don't get much poontang.

Moral of the story, I really like my vibrator. 




 But i ask for extra shots ^and light ice ^and a dash of almond milk ^and please don't spit in it 




 Obama needs you to explore your.... health care options. Open enrollment now online! 




 God, you and my boyfriend :(

The sex drives of a geriatric humpback whales. 









 The latter is me, but with an iced Americano.... God, I should just kill myself now. 




 I've met more atheist and agnostics in MA (Marijuana Anonymous) than theists. 12-Step meetings can be about the group. 

Think about it this way. 5 people are bigger than 1 person, or higher. This group of 5 people is a bigger 'thing' than yourself. This belief in the bigger group than yourself can be powerful. Group mentality. Faith in something bigger than yourself. It isn't a God, isn't a bunch of Gods, it's a bunch of people. I have faith in a bunch of people, because collectively they are my higher power.

 As addicts, we shouldn't give advice, only relay our own personal experiences and what has worked for other people. I think for the most part, you've done a good job doing just that. 

Any who, congrats, and keep up the good work. One day at a time.
