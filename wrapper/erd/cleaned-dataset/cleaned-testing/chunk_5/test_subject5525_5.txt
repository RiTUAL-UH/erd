 That's how I'd approach it, but unless the piece had movement that required that form, I'd find a workaround. I've got good hands, but that's a bear. 




 I don't use my mic at all. Every now and again, I'll reheat veggies or steam veggies in the mic, but other than that (and a very occasional bag of popcorn) I don't use it at all.

Funny story, though. I had a small economy mic in my kitchen that probably bounced through two or three different places that we lived. We had some friends over for the weekend, and a friend of a friend broke the little latchy thingy that closes the door, rendering the microwave inoperable. By the time I got downstairs, she was already gone to the nearest big box store to replace it. I would have told her not to worry, but friends said that she was ultra upset about it, and needed to replace it.

Long story short, I now have this deluxe, high-end microwave, all programmable and shit, with the porcelain inductor element for browning, several bells and a couple of whistles, that I use to occasionally heat up leftover veggies.  




 From bottom to top, pinky-first-second-third. But that's a real tough way to play a Dm, why not play it in first position? Or, just play the barre chord? Are you learning that BOC song that's played with all the chords on the inside four?

 Whoever that is, I have a feeling that I would definitely not like hanging out with them. Sweet battlestation though, you know, minus the dildos. 




 [PickPunch](http://www.pickpunch.com/plastic-sheets.html) sells them on their website, might not be the best price, but readily available in small quantities. 




 As always, the answer here is to talk to your SO about this, in a  non-confrontational, non-accusing way.

Saying that, I wouldn't look too much into it. My wife and I have an active and exciting sex life. She is my porn star. When I get bored and surf the web for porn, I don't look for the "normal" porn, I like to check out the extreme stuff. And not always for self-release, sometimes I just like to see Japanese women peeing on seafood, or Brazilian women farting into cakes. Yes, I search this out because these are things that I don't see at home, but that doesn't mean that I want my wife to pee on an octopus, or fart with her ass full of peanut butter, or get railed by three well-endowed black fellas for that matter. 

 






















































 I don't see a blowout either, but I can see a win. UoM could take it, but they won't take it by ten, and I'm not sure that the score will go that high for either team.

 




 My B home course, [Tuscawilla Park](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98#) (Touchawilly) has recently put in a zipline course.

Love this course, extra strokes for hitting a zipliner. (I've come close a few times!) 




 We scored 24 at home against Toledo while only using a third of our playbook. Muschamp is playing against the tape. He's wily.  









 No, not really. Most of these types of laws are called "Blue Laws"; they're just holdovers from a more prudish time. Our American system of law doesn't make it as easy to repeal laws as it is to pass them, so these laws are still on the books, but not really ever enforced.

Saying that, there have been times recently where these laws were used to arrest people, most recently in Texas, where a male couple were arrested for violating state sodomy laws, but the judge threw the case out of court. 




 The first couple years are adjustment years, and that's tough because the first couple years are also the busiest and hardest couple of years. Talk with your SO, make plans to set aside a small amount of time (baby comes first, dad) for yourself. When the kid gets a little older it becomes a little easier.

I also am a musician, and had to give up the stage for fatherhood. While I miss it terribly, I now have a home recording studio, two great and curious kids that see me in the studio, making music daily, and am making plans to attempt a comeback to the stage. 

Good luck, dad. Make time for baby. Make time for SO, make time for you. That order for the next couple of years. 




 I think a phone call or two is reasonable. If he's already been contacted and has your number, I feel like the next step is his. If he wants it, he'll call you. 

If I was in your spot I'd probably hang on to it for a little while longer, but if I didn't hear from him again for a few weeks, keep the disc, toss the disc, sell the disc. 














 Yeah, that's pro level shite right there, but seriously, get a new cutting board. If you use those types of plastic cutting boards, you either have to scrape them down fairly regularly or replace them. All those scratches and cuts harbor germs, no matter how well you wash them. You can bleach soak it, but then you run the danger of not rinsing well enough.

Brown - Cooked Meat

Blue - Seafood

Yellow - Raw Chicken

Green - Veggies

**Dude. New cutting board. Now. And blue is for fish, not veggies.**

Thanks, had to get that out of my system. 




 Ok, for real. My two favorites are [Ultimateguitar.com](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) because it allows me to one-click transpose keys, and I also like [e-chords.com](http://www.e-chords.com/) for just about the same reason, though it's key based instead of step based. UG.com gives a good auto-scroll, but e-chords has multiple chord shapes, so good and bad in both.

Saying that, I almost always just google what I'm looking for, because not every site is going to have what I want, and I've just got enough experience to know which sites I prefer, and will look for them in results first. But I use what I have to to learn what song I'm looking for, even OLGA...lol, even youtube for that matter, a good source of video lessons.

Happy hunting.

 Good on her for reading well.

That said, one of the biggest problems that I have with our education system is that we treat each kid as exactly the same. Each kid at this certain point should be able to do A, B, and C, and if they don't, they're falling behind.

I don't feel that our kids are interchangeable pieces in a puzzle, and both my kids read above their level, but my older child's comprehension is terrible. So does that mean that I should be happy that he knows big words, or concerned that he doesn't remember what they mean? We can't keep shoehorning our kids into pigeonholes that we want them to fit in...

Saying all that, if she's reading that well, you're probably doing a good job at home helping...keep it up. Raising an intelligent child takes more than our manufacturing model of a school system that teaches little else than blind respect for authority and the ability to memorize useless trivia and recall it on demand.

 I was just talking about this here...also, Muschamp may be trying to load the tape, get Miami looking at a bunch of stuff they don't need to know. He sneaky. I like.  




 We're getting to a point where a lot of teams are a whole lot better than one would expect. I think that because of the increased TV coverage every year, it makes more sense to be a starter on a "bad" team than it would to be a second- or third-string on a "good" time. I enjoyed the Toledo/UF game.

Go Knights, BTW. 




 I was surprised...happy...elated....drunk...that was a good Saturday. 




 Oh come on now....I like the Bulls, I like the Golden Knights, hell I'll even watch a Miami game every now and again....and my local II school, Stetson Hatters, won a big opener....first game in almost a hundred years! 




 Heh. Yep.

 Hey hey hey. Stopping by to check out the competition.

As a Gator fan, I suppose it's expected that I give out a mighty 'GO PANTHERS!!' but I just don't have it in me.

I lived and worked in Tallahassee for a decade, and my job required my attendance at several games. I enjoyed, and still enjoy, Seminole football...just not in the last week of November, and any time that the Seminoles losing means we win something.

So for the first time this season, and perhaps only time, (depends...I think I'll be rooting for the Nation to take Clemson down!) let me give a hearty..

 Short answer is that when the punting team is the first to touch the punted ball, the ball is dead. If the receiving team is the first to touch the ball, the ball becomes live, and can be moved upfield, recovered by the other team, or, when it rolls into the endzone, touched back. 







































 Correct. They wouldn't need one of those dedicated sound cards with the connections (and bells and whistles), but if they are buying an off the shelf PC, they might want to consider a soundcard upgrade for sound quality. (Especially important for sound reproduction which makes the mixing side of home recording a whole lot easier.) 




 This happens too often. 

Collect to go menus. Rip the restaurant names off, fold up and put in a jar. No restaurant picked in two rounds, pick out of the jar. 




 Welll.....I can say that now, because frankly, I've put my dong in crazy enough times to know it's never worth it, and got lucky enough to come out the other end with a good woman. 




 First, all of your questions can be answered at [Tweakheadz Labs](http://tweakheadz.com/). Learn. Learn more. Read. Read more. Reference. Great site.

1. Two schools of thought. Dedicated computer for recording is gonna cost half a buttload, with high end sound card with dedicated recording connectors. Or, any decent off the shelf with a soundcard upgrade. (I use a PC straight out of the box, with a soundcard that cost about $200)

2. You need a DAW (recording software) and yes it must be compatible. There are many out there. Some free. Some thousands.

3. Connections depend on the interface. For an amp recording, in general would be amp - condenser mic - A/D interface. There are many other options though, check Tweak.

4. Cable control! It will get worse before it gets better, learn to tame the cables. Use cable ties, and label them.

5. Read the guide man. It probably came with paperwork. If not, google the product name and number, you can  usually find it online.

6. I've been a musician for 25+, and a home recorder for a decade. I spend more time researching than playing/recording. (To be fair, most of my troubles are in the mixdown area, learning how to engineer a decent sound out of what I just recorded.)

7. You should also check out r/wearethemusicmakers here on reddit. Pros that don't (usually) mind answering noob questions.

 Yeah, mine too, but now I get points for it! 




 Funnies: Before match play, the group comes up with a selection of scenarios. Things that can happen on the course, but are rare enough to be unique. 

Examples:

* Hit a tree on the drive, still par
* Out of bounds, in bound shot for par
* Chain out birdie, still par

It is only limited by what you want to imagine, and the group assigns points to the individual "funnies" . (You can even have bonus multipliers like hit a tree on the drive, still par for three points, tree drive and birdie, double it for six.)

Get creative. We score it by total points + strokes under par (or minus over) for total win. Put some money on it and make an interesting disc golf outing. 



















 In between Orlando and Tampa is a whole lot of woods, and a whole lot of rednecks. While stopping in any of these small towns can provide a *certain* type of entertainment, I wouldn't bring my sister with me.

Saying that, Tampa (and the metro area) is one of the larger cities in the Southeast, and offer lots of things worth doing. 

I used to live in the area, about a half hour south of Clearwater, but I live on the East Florida coast now, so some info may be dated, but I get over there often enough.

First and foremost, in St Petersburg, south of your destination after leaving the Tampa area, is the [Dali Museum](http://thedali.org/home.php). Worth the trip. (If you're going out of your way, check out [Fort Desoto](http://fortdesoto.com/) an early Spanish emplacement.

In Tampa, there are museums and galleries and historic places galore, but what stands out in my mind is [Ybor City](http://www.yborcityonline.com/), the old Cuban area of downtown. I know you already did your shopping touristy thing, but the afternoons and early evenings are for checking out the artsy little shops while you figure out which awesome restaurant you want to eat at. Stay into the evening for great music everywhere. 

Clearwater itself is kinda boring. It's got great beaches, so definitely get your feet wet, and you should also know that Clearwater is home to a large [group of Scientologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida#Scientology) who were trying to take over the world.

If you play discgolf by any chance, Clearwater is a hotbed of disc golfing activity.

Enjoy your trip. And one final note. As you come into Tampa on I-4, to merge into I-275, your most likely route, do be careful. It gets just a little insane through that area, and play your driving to NOT be in that area during rush hours.  





























 It's not exactly what you're talking about, but you should check out the doc section of [instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com/genres/130). I love this site for my Netflixing. So much better of a UI. 




 Think on this.

If you know the notes of the guitar, the scales up and down the strings, and you know the forms for F and Bm, then you know barres.

The notes on the E string, E(open) F (1) G(3) A (5) and so on right?

The full barre form of the F chord, from the bass E, is 133211, right?

So, looking at the root of the F barre, the first fret on the bass E is F, right?

So if the next step up at the third fret on the bass E is the G note, then it stands to reason that the same form that is an F when the root is on the first fret would be a G when the root is on the third fret. (3355433)

So as long as you know the notes up the E string, you know the barre forms for all of those chords. This also works for most barre variants. The Fm shape (133111) played where the root note is on the 5th fret on the bass E would be an Am. (355333)

Same theory applies to the Bm barre form that's played on the second fret on the A string.(x24432) One half step up from that root B is the C note, so that same form slid up one half step becomes a Cm. (x35543)

Does that help? 




 Get rechargeables. You will save a ridiculous amount of money this way. Also be choosy about toys. There are so many toys out there that make noise just because they can. They don't necessarily add any education/play for baby or older, they just are loud. We personally choose to stay away from most battery operated toys, preferring to let our children's imagination decide what that fire truck should sound like.

 Umm.

Reddit is an amazing source of news, current events, and social concerns. There are great minds having great discussions on subs all over this site. It truly is the front page of the internet, and an amazing tool.

Reddit is an amazing source of boobs, current beaver shots, and gay porn. There are hot chicks posting pics of their hot bods on subs all over this site. It truly is the first place I go to wank it, my amazing tool.

You did both, I think. If you proctor his time on reddit and introduce him to the right things, and don't let him on without supervision, and guide his front page customization, you might be alright. But the porn will happen anyway, and Reddit isn't the worst place to experience it. 




 Yep. You can get a lot of respectable distance out of a forehand, but kinetic chaining is how you get the real long distance; that comes from the run-up and the cross step...things that are eliminated with the forehand to a certain degree. 




 I hope so. Nice to meet another dye-er out there. We have a good group on Thursday mornings, about seven of us regulars...you could prbably beat six of us... 




 The brown spots on your skin look like a fungal infection....similar to athlete's foot. Before an expensive trip to the dermy, try showering with an anti-dandruff shampoo. Use it as a bodywash for about two weeks. If they don't clear up, you're only out the price of a bottle of head and shoulders...lol. (Experience? My dermatologist wrote me a scrip for something that looked very familiar, and then the nurse told me to try the anti-dandruff shampoo first. Never filled the scrip.) 














 That was the one that I was familiar with. 




 That's part of why I switched as well. At 41, I could feel it staining my elbow.

 It is crap. Utter crap. But, and this is important...*they're reading*.

Think about that for a second.

Even if only one of ten, hell even one of one hundred, continue to read, they will move past this crap, and hopefully become well rounded adult readers.

Isn't there anything you read as a kid/teen that you might be embarrassed to admit to?

Saying that...jesus christ, two shelves of that shit? Garbage.

 I started this game as a forehand player. I had a respectable drive forehand, hitting just short of the 300' wall, but I knew that I needed to add backhand to my game. I focused on it, and months all I could throw was about 250'.

First major thing to look at is disc selection. I dumbed my discs down. Threw midranges as my drivers until I could crank them a bit. Reason behind that is that shorter/lower speed discs are "easier" to throw; simply meaning that if you are out there trying to throw a speed 13 400' without good form, you are going to have trouble getting good throws.

Second, just focus on form. Keep throwing it right. It took me a few months, but once I could throw lower speeds closer to where I knew they should go, I went back to my drivers, and was able to send 'em out far.

One year of dedicated practice later, I can send my speed 10 beasts an easy 300-325, and getting better every time I play.

Stick with it, keep practicing, and throw the right plastic.

Good luck. 









 Hmmm, well, I've got this big bucket over here to hold all the downvotes, so....

Dubstep and its ilk are not music, it's sound. 

Well organized, well mixed, interesting sound, but not music.

 True enough. I just said *less* slant, not non-existent. Even though I've enjoyed much of Moore's docs, I don't know if any of his would be on my personal 100 best...just too slanty. 




 I've seen most of these, and I think it's a fair list.

But...

Moore's Sicko in the top 25? And not Bowling for Columbine? Sicko was decent, but BFC was done with far less slant than Sicko, and far more powerfully done.

An Inconvienent Truth barely breaking the top 100? It wasn't the best cinematic piece, but I think the importance of that doc will only increase over time.

That being said, I'm so happy to have seen most of the doc's on this list, that I'm gonna pull my Prius over and sniff my own farts for a minute or two. 




 I assume that the Gators candle is going to smell like the jeans shorts crotch of a sweaty co-ed, with a bit of cheap domestic beer thrown in, with undertones of chewin' tobaccy, and a slight hint of regret. 



















 Yeah, I play in FL, so it wasn't the best decision, but I put a big black military star on it, and it's surprisingly easy to find, midrange too, so I'm not hucking it out 300' and trying to guess where it ended up. 




 The new formulas of RIT dyes are on the shelves, and they don't work for dyeing.

Well, sort of.

I've had some luck stipling (spotting) discs with RIT dye black and getting really interesting changes on color. I stipled a white goldline River with black RIT and got blue speckles. I also made a paste of RIT black and used it on a bright green Innova champ Shark to get a military/olive green. Both of these were using the powder packs, with no water, just enough acetone to make mud. I haven't tried the liquid RIT.

I've used the Idye Poly line, without the color conditioner, and I get bright vibrant color quickly, with little to no problems.

My. Two. Cents. 



















 Yes, obvious to most of us, but I was surprised by how many folks I spoke to today had never heard of Snopes.
