 People said the same thing about the fact that Iran was on the same side as the US during the last 2 wars. On many, many occasions. They've just slipped our national consciousness. Iran seems to keep finding itself beside the US, a country the Islamic Republic's founder described as the Great Satan while Iran was part of the Axis of Evil in Bush-era rhetoric. As an example, here's an instance Iran's little known role in [Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_uprising_in_Herat). But American journalists don't tend to have long term memory, and that memory doesn't shape national narrative the way contemporary soundbites do in any case. Everybody but us, and some of our allies, is caricatured as a monolithic entity - our stated 'enemies' in particular being solely ideologically driven and pragmatic. So naturally in a year, Iran will again be on the same side and we'll again be bewildered.

It would have some validity if there was some doubt as to whether this was torture or not. There isn't. This was torture. This is not a matter of connotation and whether to call a fat guy a 'heavy set man' or 'obese'/'fat'.

 Girl marrying outside is considered apostasy in Islam and apostasy is punishable by death.

False - its not apostasy. Its considered adultery since the marriage is illegal. The punishment, in Islamic law, for the girl is 100 or so lashes if she's witnessed by four witnesses having sex with the man. You don't need to editorialize what went down with false claims to make it seem more wrong than it already is... 




 Which is the exact purpose of OPs account 









 Read the article - it gets worse. It appears grand juries have been held for 160,000+ civilian trials while only ~80 grand juries were held for cop crime cases. 




 Thank you - I'll explore more in that direction. I was limited by the data set since the USGS set completely ignores non-US quakes of these lower magnitudes if they aren't felt in 2010 onwards.

 I was tinkering with some data here (for fun):

http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/year/eqstats.php

Note that I'm aware that I'm looking at data for 23 years of a planet much much older than that so the sample size isn't even great.

Based on the number of global Earthquakes in 3 categories (magnitude 4.0+, 5.0+ and 6.0+), can we say though that there will likely be more of these noticeable Earthquakes over the next 10 years? Statistics is more of my strong suit than seismology - is this question not even valid (are past trends of Earthquakes not predictive of future events)? 

I also noticed that there seems to have been a substantial jump in the number of 4.0+ recorded Earthquakes from before 1994 to after 1994. This is in spite of the fact that ("Starting in January 2009, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center no longer locates earthquakes smaller than magnitude 4.5 outside the United States, unless we receive specific information that the earthquake was felt or caused damage."). Is this because we're using better tools now, are detecting in more places, or has there legitimately been more Earthquakes after that point consistently?

 They're not saving them out of humanity. Unlike the idiots at ISIS, they understand that captured enemies provide intel... 




 That's true, but there isn't any video or statement from their group that they're actually using the kids to fight. They're training the kids, sure, but its not much different than videos that previously surfaced of Shi'ite children in camo doing the same thing. Or white boys taking their kids out to play paintball in full camo with Osama bin Laden shooting targets.

 I like that you guys can take trolling w/ a sense of humor! 




 You seem to have good knowledge. Does this issue not interest you? I will try to Google and see if some scholars have commented on this marriage and what the views are of the various schools of thoughts on how this marriage happened, and if it happened a certain way, is it permissible for Muslims today to emulate it since it is Sunnah. 

I just know a few things - this issue doesn't particularly interest me. If the Prophet did something, and it was not exclusively for him, or it was not something initially permissible that was later abrogated to make it impermissible, than it would be good to go. But that's where fiqh comes in, along with tons of context/research.

In this case, I don't know that this nikah procedure actually went down the way OP said. From my understanding, the majority opinion in all four madhahib have witness requirements. My understanding is that witnessing is also required in the other mainstream sects (Ibadiyya and Shi'a Zaydiyya). I think the only group that allows marriage without witnesses as a majority would be Shi'a Ithna Ashariyyah (but I've never even seen a 12er quoting this story as proof for the belief). 

So for most fuqaha across the board - they clearly aren't giving credence to the riwayah OP mentioned. I can also completely understand why a Muslim man in the first 300 years would've concocted a riwayah like that since it would tend towards legitimizing adultry. All you have to do is secretly say "we're married" and you can sleep together, with none of the formalities, protection and restrictions of a proper nikah. If you get the woman pregnant, you can deny that you were ever married or did anything (no witnesses), which nullifies the principle of legal protection.  




 Are they issuing camera tickets for HOV violations or anything like that? 




 Yes. It says, [15/9](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=15 verse=9) - quite explicitly, "Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian." I.E. God protects it (albeit through human agency of what Muslims consider the best generation of mankind, the Companions of the Prophet). 




 Hey guys,

I'm gonna be up in Seattle for a while and I'll be using their 520 toll bridge. Has anybody else gone up there? Does their bridge recognize our plates? Do you get the bills in the mail? And if that is the case - is there a better way to pre-pay?

Thanks! 




 I don't know enough about the topic to comment - I was clarifying your high-level criticism of Ibn Kathir's criticism of some earlier reports in deference to other early reports / lack of reports. If you can provide me with the relevant athar, I can help validate it - but that's about it for this issue. 




 I dunno bout you but I lol'ed 




 What motivation would the early scholars have to fabricate a story like this about Allah's Apostle? Wouldn't the claims of earlier scholars hold more weight than the likes of Ibn Khatir, who were born a long time after the life of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)? 

Earlier scholars didn't fabricate stories - that's completely simplifying the issue. The issue is one of how they got their information. People like Ibn Ishaq for instance didn't have any trouble gathering stories from individuals who weren't particularly reputable in the field, and from non-Muslims. He also often failed to provide colophons. The end result? Some recorded stories without sanad that may even have found their way to later collections and aren't true, are likely not even recorded by Muslims. Early Muslim scholars don't have a motivation to fabricate stories, but when some of these historians failed to be rigorous in how they collated material, we're naturally going to get conflicting stories - some of which don't line up with those gathered from more reputable sources.

Ibn Kathir btw is not a primary source. He's not providing new information. He's literally combing through the reports by the early historians and pointing out which ones are more likely true than not. Which ones are more likely untrue than not. 




 Okay - fair enough, thank you 




 Happy to answer your question - I'd appreciate if you would now would care to provide some elucidation on mine as to how your group deals with the different Qira'at? Particularly, my question: In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. **So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word does mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?**

Firstly let me ask you this, according to your belief who will be the last prophet present on earth? Jesus or Muhammad (sa)? If it is Jesus (and we know it is) then how do you reconcile this with the Qirat last...The point I am making is if you believe in the verse as 'Last of the prophets' in every sense, then there can be no Jesus to return.

Jesus will be last on Earth. There's no resolution  needed imo .. since the ayah isn't about who the last Nabi to walk on Earth is.

The point you're making can only be made by interpolating the ayah to read something like 'khatim al anbiyya **fi dunya**' (last of the Prophets in Earth). The verse doesn't say that - it simply says, "last of the Prophets". Pretty much every early sect believes Jesus is alive and was alive (Ahlus Sunnah, Shi'a Ithna Ashariyya, Shi'a Zaydiyya, (Kharijji) Ibadiyya) - ergo he was Nabi while the Prophet was Nabi, so your analogy is wholly a strawman. Since the vast majority believes Jesus is alive, it follows that your analogy should read more like the one I provided: Man A of the Letters family has a son B, and no other children. Son B dies without having any children. Man A lives well after his son. **The last member of the Letters family was therefore A, not B, according to you?**

You don't get the desired results by analogy of what we actually believe that you would with your analogy (which doesn't fit the situation as you add additional clauses).

The verse doesn't say 'last person to *become* a prophet'.

If I say you're the last person in a family, do I need to explicitly say you're the last person to be given birth to? Or will 99% of people understand that to mean you were the last person to join that family (to be born into it) by the obvious rendering of the statement?

 I just want to add that so you don't think all I have got is one argument.

I'm sure you have other reasons to believe what you do. That's fine - I'm here though to understand specifically this topic. There are different Qira'at, how do you resolve that the ayah literally reads 'last' in one qira'a - which implies that it means 'last' in all the other Qira'a.

We don't believe this about Ahmad either so it is not relevant. 

It isn't relevant in terms of what you believe, but it is directly relevant to the analogy you presented. Your analogy would require Sunnis to believe either (a) Jesus ceased to be a Nabi at ascension or (b) he will return with new wahi to displace old wahi. Neither of which Sunnis believe, making your analogy inapplicable. 




 However, if in the future somebody declares a physical war against Islam then the Muslims

So essentially, fighting does not become permissible in your religion until somebody explicitly says "I declare war on Islam"? If they invade your country without saying that and decimate your family - defending yourself against them is not jihad than? 




 I guess it would still be parthenogenesis, but I'm thinking about species that where the female gave birth to males - so I don't see how that would be literally a clone? 




 Okay - thanks for the clarification. 




 I don't think the colonel is self-proclaiming that he's a "truly great Muslim" - I'm sure if you guys talked directly to each other, he's a fine guy. Just very Pakistani in his way of delivering a pov :) 




 Ahmadi leaders said fighting against the British occupation in India was not jihad, because the British largely offered freedom of religion to Muslims...

I appreciate the historical information - but I'm pretty sure Ahmadis believe there's a monopoly on jihad by the Amir of Ahmedis (or the amir of w/e subsect you belong to) so by extension, any jihad that the Ahmadi amir hasn't legitimized is a false jihad. Correct? 




 [Sources of Waswaas and Accountability](http://islamqa.info/en/39684) 




 You didn't answer my question regarding this - I want to know how you guys deal with the Qira'at and I'd appreciate an answer if you're knowledgeable enough about your religion to provide me with one: In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. **So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word does mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?**

That's a completely irrelevant argument because you have already begun with the premise that Z is last (because we already know it is last in the alphabet). 

Reworded just for you: Man A of the Letters family has a son B, and no other children. Son B dies without having any children. Man A lives well after his son. **The last member of the Letters family was therefore A, not B, according to you?**

There is a room, let's call it earth. J enters the room. J leaves the room. M enters the room. M leaves the room, never to return. J reenters the room. Who was the last person in the room, subject M or J?

Your analogy doesn't work - nubuwwah isn't about walking around in a room or on Earth. Nubuwwah is about receiving wahi. The statement from the Qur'an is that Muhammad is 'khatim al anbiyyah' (the last (khatim) of the (al) [people who] receive wahi (anbiyyah)). Are you saying that Sunnis believe 'Isa will come with new wahi that will displace the recorded wahi of Muhammad? If so, do you have evidence to support the assertion? Also - are you saying that though Jesus is alive, nubuwwah was lifted from him and he ceased to be a nabi while he's alive in Heaven (another logical requirement of your analogy)?

Muhammad also left the world during Isra and Miraj (or do you guys believe something else about that too?). During the night he left, people would've died who hadn't accepted Islam. Since Muhammad was not on this Earth, there was no Prophet on the Earth, so it was a period of fatrah. Will the people who died on kufr that night be held according to Islam or according to the people of fatrah - since per you, absence of a nabi on Earth is the absence of nubuwwah for that Nabi? Did Muhammad cease to be a Nabi for the night of Isra and Miraj? 




 We accept the word can mean last.

In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word **does** mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?

Bear in mind, Sunnis also believe Jesus will return. So they believe another prophet will come. Our belief breaks the seal of prophethood not even an iota more than the Sunni belief. In fact, if anything it is the Sunni belief which breaks the seal.

Man Y of the Alphabet family has a son Z, and no other children. Son Z dies without having any children. Man Y lives well after his son. The last member of the Alphabet family was therefore Y, not Z, according to you? When you draw a genealogical tree, you put Y after Z? Sounds like logical/linguistic gymnastics to me, but if that satisfies you and you're honest with yourself in saying that, then we're obviously at an impasse. 




 A rich person of the time of Abu Jafar As Sadiq sent his slave to ask him about the pleasure of finger to the woman. Abu Jafar replied and said it is permissible as long as you are using your own body parts and the woman allows it. In other words you cannot use any other tools to give pleasure to her. He was an old man so the young woman wasn't satisfied from him so he improvised. 

Source? [To clarify - do you know the primary source of the narration?] 




 You do realize that 99% of Ahmadis aren't on Reddit and that I didn't say it was 99% of Ahmadis? I simply asked a question... 




 He's saying that this Qira'a has **khatim** not khatam, which leaves no room for ambiguity. His point is that in this Qira'a there is no "alternative meaning". Is your resolution of the issue to just reject the Qira'a (which also has tawattur) or did you just misunderstand his argument? 




 They're entitled to their view so **we just made our own separate sub and myself and most the guys just keep away from here** to avoid all the arguments and creating discord.

Than what's with the spam bots that Ahmadi spam bots that hit people up by PM... 




 They're a group who believes Jesus went to India, that there was a new Prophet and that fighting against British occupation over India (when the religion was created) was conveniently a sin. 




 Aisha was never a slave. She was the daughter of Abu Bakr, a free man. 




 repressive religion represses sex

By providing boundaries and a legal process in the event that a partnership doesn't work out? Is it repressive to allow something only in the confines of a contract that has weight in a court vs allowing everybody to fuck around willy nilly and then footing the bill for their abortions, orphaned children, psychological trauma, STDs, non-working/unskilled partners and all the other results of the 'sexual freedom' direction your society is moving towards? 

Social conservatism, religious or not, doesn't exactly require religion to back it up - and its pretty strongly supported in many countries where religion isn't even as dominant anymore (China, Russia, etc.) 




  Because it's social justice. When we let people run amok, we're partially responsible for letting it happen.

The Prophet explicitly said He was not responsible *even for Muslims* living outside of his dominion. If you want to spread something to non-Muslim societies, focus on tawheed. Spreading rules/regulations is a distant second in terms of importance. 




 It would refer specifically to the Muslim community where Islam is dominant. Non-Muslim society, and minority communities in Western countries aren't what's being talked about in these sort of traditions - otherwise, as you mentioned, even in the Prophet's time, you'll run into that having been the case in many parts of the World. 




 Good luck getting that labeled as a 'terror attack' and reaching front page on any of the news subs unlike the attacks by the Palestinians. 




 I find it interesting that we look for explanations beyond the obvious for stuff like Sulayman talking to ants, Mary having a virgin birth, Isra and Miraj - at a time, when science has shown many of these things literally happening. Scientists have found ways to communicate with certain ant colonies. We've observed rare virgin births in animal species. And we can now travel at the speeds necessary to have completed Isra and Miraj. And yet, Muslims seem to have become more, rather than less, skeptical about these things being possible in the past. 




 feminism and queer studies and transgenderism 

Why? Queer/transgender studies don't always result in what the LGBTQ lobbiests want to hear (see basically anything out of John's Hopkins for instance). But we need this information to address real issues that these people experience. Simply prohibiting castration/homosexuality and ignoring isn't enough in a time when these things are becoming widely accepted, and you can't understand these issues until you talk to the people experiencing them. 




 /r/worldnews isn't representative of Reddit imo. It's a very popular sub that even the Google feeds pick up. If anything, that sub is subject likely to be [more subject to shilling](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) than any other sub on the entire site. Take that, coupled with the fact that people who frequent the sub are barraged with negative anecdotal international stories and simple people turn anecdote into statistics. 




 Yup. There is one. That Aisha was much older than is widely presumed. Several academic scholars have questioned the veracity of the claim. 

I don't know how an "academic scholar" would question the veracity of that claim, if by academic you mean a Western Historian. The argument of "truth of embarrassment" is a pretty established historical method for verifying statements (essentially that if a community is embarrassed or needs to engage in polemic about a saying it produced - that saying is true since the originator wouldn't fabricate something embarrassing/attackable about his own community/self). It's a bit of an anachronism for this topic though since Aisha's age wasn't even part of anti-Islamic polemic until modern times. Early polemic was actually critical about Muhammad's marriage to Zaynab - I'd be legitimately surprised if you can find any pre-20th century polemical criticism of Aisha's age of marriage.

I find it hard to believe that marrying a 9 year old at any point was acceptable.

Than you've got a very short term understanding of history. The very first thing OP said was "the tu quoque fallacy (pointing out that other people did it too)" - it's because there are countless examples of people in the past marrying at much younger ages than us. Arbitrary ages (18 in America, 16 in Europe and various other numbers) are based on essentially meaningless numbers. Have sex with a girl over 18 - you're good. Have sex with a girl that's 17 years and 365 days old, you're a sex offender and a pedophile. They have nothing to do with the development physically or mentally of an individual, life expectancy, etc. And they don't even compare to arbitrary (and non-arbitrary) marital restrictions of past communities. In other cultures, people were married and the marriage consummated (the married woman goes to live with the male) even before they had a period (see Biblical/Talmudic accounts of Rebbeca and Isaac as an example of 3 a year old getting married). I remember even in recent times a big hub bub about young marriages (post-Bat/Bar Mitzvah - think ages ~12-14) in Israel.

There is absolutely zero chance in my mind that the historically accepted age of 6/7 has even a 1% chance of being true. 

Then you're arguing emotionally (even if you are able to cite an academic after the fact). You need to step outside of the issue if you want to look at it objectively. The question isn't whether this is strange to us, but whether or not it is more likely true than not. And the tasheeh of certain narrations over others suggests that it is. 




 If the people will continue to sin no matter what, then the Qur'an says they will be punished after death. Killing them early doesn't save them because they have already sinned anyway. So killing them isn't merciful, it is taking away their last bit of enjoyment before an eternity of torment.

You don't know that they're going to Hell - or that they're going to Hell for eternity. All we know from the nass is that they were destroyed on Earth. Unless there is a specific statement of their eternal damnation, in Islam, you're taught not to speak of it. Statements on punishment are not immutable - the intended purpose is to warn people away from sin. If God simply said, "I encourage you not to do this" - people would take less heed than if God says, "doing this leads to Damnation" because of our nature and the effect of fear of a thing being more meaningful than a suggestion against a thing.

And even when there are statements of eternal damnation, its not necessary that the damnation will actually be "eternal" for the parties. The example is the saying that (at some point) everyone with "a mustard seed of Faith" will be pulled from the Hellfire. If they are continuously going to sin, and increase in sin, then when their life is cut short, they have less potential to sin further into the future - which in turn reduces their suffering in an afterlife (or increases their reward in case they skip Hell altogether). The children they would've had otherwise, who would've had the same influence, never exist. It is definitely a mercy to die if the alternate is that in your future, you would only have become a worse human being. It's also a mercy on future generations, that through that reminder, are vividly discouraged from engaging in sins.

Having said that, your point that Allah is not "ever-merciful" covers this, if correct. Can you supply a verse?

I can't point you to a single verse, but you have read the translation cover-to-cover I presume so you've seen countless examples where Allah acts with Justice, or Wrath. I suppose you can read "tabbat yadda Abi Lahaban wa tabb" (roughly destruction on the hands of Abu Lahab and Him) and the rest of it to the end. The entire Surah is about punishment. From beyond the Qur'an, the textual evidence is His Saying "Verily, My Mercy prevailed over My Wrath." (or preceded over, etc.) - it's evidence that mercy and wrath are mutually exclusive innately, that one precedes the other and that God can act with both.

However, I then find it difficult to accept the virtue of mercy at all. One can be merciful without being "ever-merciful", but I don't think the wrathful killing of an entire city/generation is compatible with any level of mercy.

We'll just disagree on that than. In Islam, when the life of a child is naturally taken away - that doesn't come off immediately as a mercy either with the outlook you've presented. Because how can 'death'/'destruction' be merciful? It is a fact of life - innocent children die all the time, and the Creator is also Malik over everything that happens on Earth. But the death of a child is a mercy on the child (in Islam) by automatic entrance in Heaven, the saying "the Child will open the doors to Heaven for the parents it left behind" and so forth. It's a bit simplistic to say that 'death' or 'destruction' is automatically not reconcilable with "any level of mercy" imo 




 ... I think I'll stick to paying the tribute.

 Killing them for sinning or transgressing does not seem very merciful

I was always taught that if I see an animal suffering and effectively dying, to put it out of its misery. Killing those animals was mercy. You can't take an action (like killing in this example) and attribute a good/bad, just/merciful to it, separate of the doer of the action and context in which its done. If there is a community so engrossed in sin, and God knows they will live on only to have a ridiculous bad-deed:good-deed ratio, its merciful on His part to save them from themselves.

That said, Islam doesn't teach that God is ever-merciful either. Being al-Adl (the Just) is also an attribute of God. Islamic tradition teaches that 'his mercy precedes his wrath' - but that doesn't mean He can't act with a different attribute.

 20 minutes of running doesn't involve taking it up the ass 




 Damnit, is there a proper double blind done on this topic by an accredited institution than? Don't leave us ~~hanging~~ erect... 




 But I think this question is still valid purely because we are playing with definitions. 

I don't think this is simply playing with definitions, we're talking about whether God is one way or another way. That's more than definitions for us, that's asma wa sifaat.

The key point is: If God is unbounded, how can God not exist within the creation? Otherwise God is bounded to a realm outside creation. If God is unbounded, It has to be panentheistic.

Islamically, we can't say something about God - unless that something has proof in the text - and even than, it's not quite so simple. Per textual evidence, God exists within the universe in that God can 'see' what happens, God exists in the universe in 'his knowledge', and God exists within the universe in that God has complete control over everything to a sub-atomic level, etc. In that sense, God exists 'in' the Universe. We also say that God does not exist in the Universe in that God is not a thing subject to its rules, God isn't a substance being acted on by time or events like us etc. In that sense, God exists 'outside' of the Universe.

My understanding is that you're suggesting that God exists in the universe in some other way, and since Islamic text doesn't naturally read to support something like that, I can't really comment on it one way or the other - especially since I don't know precisely what you mean by unbounded. If you're suggesting that God is a substance, and this substance pervades space/time and beyond, than we don't define God as a substance where part of God can be in space/time, and part of God is subdivided outside of space/time. That is the Islamic criticism of Pantheism as Islamic scholars confronted it. 




 This is the only online academic source that deals with the question specifically and thoroughly imo:

http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/ 




 As far as I know, we know that this is not the case at all. So basically I'm asking, why would he say that when it's not true? 

As far as you know? Let's start there - can you link to academia and what modern consensus is on this issue - if there is any consensus on it?

I believe there's a paper written on this topic in particular. Don't remember what journal. The tradition you're referring to says

            .          

It isn't necessarily saying 'whoever ejaculates first determines it' - it can be read as saying that it depends on the dominance material from one gender had over ( ) material from the other gender leading to a closer similarity to the paternal uncle (in the male scenario).

We can nit-pick wording, but at that point, we'd be criticizing people for saying the sun rises. I think the meaning and motivation behind such sayings is more important. 




  It definitely needs to be more understood. Especially since a lot of people that will use this to save a penny or two are precisely those that can't shell out for a last minute ticket to get to where they actually need to go.

I dunno that it isn't understood - most people who know about this site and this sort of stuff are generally well-informed about what they'r trying to do. I agree on the premise though, the guy behind the site should be more clear in warning people about risks associated with his tool. That said, he doesn't actually make money off of it as of yet. 




 I fly once a month at least, only occasionally for business. If I'm saving $400 on a hidden city (example - any popular route) vs the contracted flight, and I'm being rerouted once a month - I'll accept losing one budget ticket a month. And even when storms do kick in, in my experience, delays have always put me through the same cities and canceled flights were all but one time compensated with a later flight following the same multi-stop path. It's anecdotal, but at least in my case - stuff like this is beneficial. 




 He could - but this is not his actual job. Just a side thing. 




 I assumed all the price comparison sites had to have agreements and pay fees to be able to get quotes and compare them.

Actually, those price comparison sites are mostly built around ITA. Building a tool like what OP's done is not impossible, or even hard. It's a matter of simply doing it, taking the risk (and potential corporate bullying as in this case), putting up any necessary capital while you operate in the red for the first year or so, etc. etc. etc. 




 I think he intentionally broke his site due to the lawsuit atm. 




 bingo 




 It's not much of a for-profit yet - doubt it's even in the green yet... 




 Not really - he suggested that there is an automated cancellation process by airline companies in general - with no proof...

Can they cancel if you miss a stop on a multi-stop route? Sure. Will they? That part depends. If they've overbooked or sold your seat to someone else after you failed to show for the first flight - you'll be told that your booking was canceled for a no-show. If you're a regular abuser or you've been flagged for other dishonesty, again, they can pull the same shit. If you do this once or twice in 5 years while only going in one direction - you're not on anybody's radar. 




 I highly doubt any systems, let alone all 'airlines' will do this automatically - its one thing to identify and penalize a repeat offender by bans or freezing their points. It's a whole nother thing to have a carte blanche automated cancellation process that can have plenty of issues adversely affecting honest customers....

Check out flyertalk - this has been discussed many times by many different people... 




 That's one of the potential downfalls of using a service like this. At the same time however, without concrete data, there's no reason to believe this happens often enough and in such a way as to be impactful to most of the people who've been using Skiplagged (successfully) for a while now. The fact that people had been doing this for ages in the not too distant past (without the use of tools like SkipLagged) would suggest it works out more often than not. 









  Having a lot of accounts open almost always lowers your score.

It quite literally does not - I just demonstrated by analogy how extending your credit line has the exact opposite effect given the part utilization plays in score - you know, based on how credit scores *actually work*...if you can't control yourself and rack up $20,000 in debt, than it's not having credit that ruined you but your own inability to control your impulses. Just about *everybody* on /r/churning has tons of credit - and nobody there is even remotely in bad debt...

 SHIZEN - DER EWIGE JUDE 




 Not really. If you apply for a card today and another one a month later, the company you apply for your 2nd one at will know about your first one. Depending on your credit score, getting a bunch of inquiries simultaneously is actually a good strategy. Your score drops down all at once but it will pick up. Meanwhile, in theory, the companies extending credit to you only see information that's been posted to date. In my case, I apply for all the credit I want every several months since I usually get instant approvals once my credit's back in the +700s. It takes a quick drop, but goes right back up over a short period of time. Rinse and repeat. 




 Say you have 3 cards, with the maximum balance offered by each bank below:

Chase $5000
BoA $5000
Barclays $5000

You have credit available at $15,000 and you only use $5,000. If you now open another account, Amex $5000, your max available is at $20,000. You just brought your utilization down to under 30% from over 30%. Utilization plays a factor in your overall score. Hence, having more credit available is almost never a bad thing. 




 I've got a 770 with over 20 credit cards, and about 7 years of credit history. Only reason to have only 3 credit cards is if you can't control yourself to not max them all out. 




 UN: Israel please stop bombing hospitals and destroying entire apartments.

Israel: *bombs more hospitals, schools and apartments*

UN: OK. In that case, please stop owning nuclear weapons.

**Stay tuned to find out how Israel reacts. The next episode may be a shocker - don't miss!** 




 They will sue you, but if you have a good lawyer and you can make a case, you can get away with not paying the excess after the repo. You credit rating will tank (will start to get better after 7 years). 




  That's very interesting, because the end effect would be that a lender has no benefit to lend to strangers...thus there's no capital for anyone. Does that mean it's nearly impossible to move up out of your social class in that country?

Does taking on interest-bearing loans help people move out of their social class? With the exception of anecdotal risk takers and owners of businesses that became successful, it seems to keep the majority of people tied into their social class - keeping in mind that the anecdotal successful risk taker / business owner is one out of every 10 failure entrepreneurs and budding venture capitalists. 




  The type of arrangement OP describes is quite common as it complies with Sharia law.

It doesn't actually, traditional fiqh books would consider this as constituting interest since deliberately precomuting interest over the base is simply getting pegged with a fee you would not be paying if you had the capital up front. But it is common. Muslim establishments in Western societies will find a work around for every inconvenient law - and in this case, at their own expense. 




 Well, back then, i was Muslim - and heavily forbidden to use interest. So, my dad, as i was 20 at the time, spoke to the dealership for hours. Thinking we won a deal, they gave us 0% APR, BUT added all the accumulated interest to the loan. Basically, a car that was work less than $20k, was sold for $30k with 0% APR.

This has nothing to do with being Muslim and entirely to do with being an imbecile. Islam prohibits interest because of alleged exploitation associated with usury. Allowing somebody you're buying something from to convince you to pay 50% of value as an upfront added interest payment over the base price in lieu of periodic interest is just semantics, and is still interest/riya in Islam. 




 Here is a poll that's shows 51 percent of Americans have anti black views http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-poll-majority-harbor-prejudice-against-blacks. So you are saying this poll is also a direct reflection of American society because numbers not personal experience tell the truth?

That's not a survey of the number of people who consider blacks a cancer or would like to use violence to expel them. Read the questions - the 51% is anyone who exhibited racial prejudice of any kind, it was the surveyors rendering of in-explicit racism. Quite different from 52% of a sample population calling a subset of the population a cancer, with 33% calling for violence - both explicit, I can't even imagine what a measure of implied prejudice would look like over an Israeli sample....

And yes, that's an accurate and reproducible reflection of prejudice in the United States that's been tested through multiple surveyors with several samples reflective of an average accounting for wealth disparity, education and political affiliation in the United States...the survey and others like it have been reproduced with roughly the same numbers and similar questions over the last several years with mutually exclusive samples each time....

So you are saying this poll is also a direct reflection of American society because numbers not personal experience tell the truth?

Yes...because statistics and statistical extrapolation trumps mindless anecdotal extrapolation in every way...

 




  Historically, the Virgin Birth stems from

Virgin birth stories were pretty popular beyond the OT in other religions as well. It's equally possible, more so even, that rather than a misreading of Isaiah 7/14 leading to the development of a virgin birth story, there was already a virgin birth story and it was later justified by casting it on re-understanding the OT. The same way as was done for many other things like crucifixion or abolition of the laws, etc. 




 Also is there anything in the Qur'an that is similar to the Book of Revelation?

No. Also though, the book of revelations is one of the fully contested books and not even attributed to Jesus or any of his immediate disciples. Its visions/prophecies of one sect of Christians later in the era that became mainstream - and you've had several prominent figures question its canonicity (Martin Luther for example).

There are Muslim prophecies of Jesus coming back, how it will happen, and what he'll do. These are collected in different books of ahadith, but most such reports I can think of are inauthentic by Islamic standards so it'll be hard to find any scholarly work with them translated into English (unlike established hadith books). 




 The Islamic equivalent of Jzus coming back is quite literally, Jzus coming back. 




 The article doesn't have to be directly about Islam in order for it to relate to Islam or Muslims....jeez talk about being anal though... 




 I can only say from personal experience

Sure, and in my experience over the last 2 years, I've observed cruel racism by Israelis (not directed at me). I've also observed a small number of marginalized Israelis who've opposed it. Neither my experience, nor your experience, are a legitimate basis for drawing an over-arching claim about Israeli society. My experience, like your experience, is anecdotal. The studies by the Peace Index and others, demonstrating prevalent and virulent racism, however are not. 




 people looking for a better life in that area make the journey to Israel ( they bypass Egypt because they will get shot to death).

They bypass Egypt because Egypt doesn't have a great immigration policy. You can't really beat being able to call it Aliyah and getting citizenship in a high GDP country by simply claiming Jewish ancestry...

It is not about blacks https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uBFN91t2z28

A YT video of a couple of responses, that may well be cherry picked, isn't quite the same as an academic study or a widely respected poll...the author of the video above has a very specific agenda while the Peace Index is well-established... 




 Study shows that MIGRANTS are cancer

If Israel had a problem with migrants, it would have a problem with most of its population and the immediate ancestors of almost all of its population. Re-read the poll - they specifically have a problem with black migrants.... 




 It's settled - I'm moving. You guys have some of the best scenery, the [best soft drinks](http://www.urgeusa.com) before us, free high quality education, free high quality medical treatment, are only a nominal part of a nominal number of international conflicts begging repercussions in the future - somebody let me know if there's anything not to love about this place before I book my ticket and rent out my flat? 




 Beating is okay - just don't threaten to rape them. 




 Very bright people are far too clever to send rape threats. Rape is much easier with an unsuspecting target. 




 Thank you. About time someone gives us assholes some fuckin credit. 




 Can't tell if troll or proper retard... 




 *facepalmpalms* 




 Pull the tampon out of your ass hole my fabulous shining white knight friend. Trolls don't care about gender at all. If their victim hadn't been a female, than they'd make jokes about you being a fat lonely neckbeard (for example - neckbeards being gender specific to males). It's not "hate" for female gamers - it's trolling. Trolling is universal and not bound by gender restrictions. You're just an idiot. 




 Pretty refreshing to see a group of top comments written by rational, intelligent people in /r/gaming for a change. 

It's funny though. Had the right person in /r/gaming seen this thread while it was still rising, they would've posted a demeaning one-liner with epic karma and this thread would've taken an entirely different turn. Missed opportunities. 




 Yup. There's multiple sub devoted to women (and men) fucking dogs. Multiple. Subs.

  So she deserves to die for her past mistakes?

Strawman. All I did was excerpt a statement from the article. I said nothing about anyone deserving to die...but keep doing the over-dramatic white-knight junatic bit, I like it. 




 Rephrased your defense of this convicted criminal who used to exploit dying old men and women to fit the narrative of a hypothetical young Jihadi girl in ISIS

You have absolutely no details how she was involved in that ~~scam~~ movement, for all we know she wasn't informed of the full details or had a very minor role, people fall into working for ~~scams~~ terrorists all the time, ~~pyramid schemes~~ terror campaigns prey on the economically weak and naive as well, sometimes people get caught up in the wrong influences when they are young.

So that maybe you'll see how retarded it sounds to minimize her crimes as if they were nothing so you can continue to deify criminals because they choose to fight people you don't like. You lot are taking the 'enemy of my enemy' to an amazing level. 




 Make of it what you will. 









 Or did he die in 1996 like they said in 1999?

He's like Bin Laden. Only Bin Laden had a final death. This guy will come back to life for the next 20 years as needed. 




 What German newsmagazine was this? Does anybody have a proper citation given that modern journalists don't seem to give two shits? Thanks in advance. 




 [Black Immigrants] settled in a very specific place, kicking out the original inhabitants and terrorizing them. Of course they would feel that [hatred]

I hope the irony of your statement isn't lost on everybody who sees that...

But regarding this claim - that its not racism, just anger towards a specific decision made by the black immigrant community as a whole - that the pale faced European Colonists only hate black immigrants because the naughty blacks chose a poor location to settle is a bit hard to swallow... You don't [forcibly sterilize a vaste swathe of people of a particular pigment and heritage](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots.premium-1.496519) because a subset of them ruined your view. That's institutionalized discrimination, and deliberate racist control of demographics.

Keep making shit up if it helps you sleep at night. 




 never call... 




  I guess you never did any mistakes in your life...you're quite pathetic.

I've never preyed on the weak and elderly, unlike your hero. 














 People are downvoting you to hell, even though [studies show over 50% of Israelis consider blacks a Cancer](http://www.timesofisrael.com/most-israeli-jews-agree-africans-are-a-cancer/) - you can only imagine how they feel about Arabs... 




 You're either completely uninformed or deliberately providing misinformation. Haaretz has almost *no* market-share in Israel itself and is a known left wing paper. No shit you're gonna find comments by rational people. But it's not a representation of the general vibe in Israel which is what was at discussion here and what you have literally zero clue about unless you're intentionally trying to sugar-coat things.

Check the same story on websites people in Israel actually use...like ynet or even jpost.

From [JPost](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Bilingual-Hebrew-Arabic-school-in-Jerusalem-caught-in-flames-383176) version of the story:

First comment criticizes **the general vibe in Israel**: Welcome to Israel circa winter 2014-15. Racist laws , an ascendant far right that would make Le Pen blush...

Second top comment is conspiracy theory

Third top comment: I wish the media would stop carrying the lie that there is a "palestinian" people. They're just arabs that were kicked out of Egypt and Jordan for bad behaviour. It's why the rest of the arab world wants nothing to do with them and gives them no aid. You're SEEING that now. They can't be civilized, they're savages. It's why Egypt and Jordan kicked them out.

Fourth top comment: The muslim terrorists will never change. Not until they have succeeded or they are dead. Lets try to help them achieve the latter outcome. Rip the bandaid off clean. It's about time. Then we can move on.

Fifth top comment - conspiracy theory.

Etc.

And I don't remember Ynet, especially the Hebrew version of the article, being any better.
 




 And is not the first staged media event Pallywood has produced. 

Yes, just like Baruch Goldstein. Just like Irv Rubin. A bunch of false flags. It's all a giant Muslim/Arab conspiracy against peace-loving innocent Israelis. /s

Dumb Ass. 




 Might as well be a quote from the Book of Genesis 









 She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners. 




 Pretty much everything in the Guiness book of World Records? 




 out of stock :( 




 why then did Abu Baku initiate an unprovoked war of aggression and conquest against Byzantine?

Do you have proof it was unprovoked? Islam doesn't just exist in a political realm, are you suggesting that converts to Islam within Byzantine territory were allowed freedom to practice? Are you suggesting that possible self-determination of Byzantine Muslim subjects would also qualify as a 'war of aggression'? There are a lot of possible provoking factors that don't require an all-out Byzantine invasion into Mecca to justify Abu Bakr's incursions. But this isn't a history sub - you likely won't find your answer here, unless you're more going for the question of whether or not Islam allows for political expansionism absent any provocation... 




  For dhu al qarnayn we don't know who/when/where he was.

Look up classical tafasir on it. You can argue that fact about a lot of individuals in the Qur'an - but the mufasireen shed some light on some of the named individuals/places in the Qur'an, especially from outside sources.

IMO - you won't have any luck with this topic. The primary context the Qur'an and ahadith use to speak, outside of themselves, are israeliyyat, and the sayings of then contemporary Christians and pagans. It wasn't particularly necessary for Islam to discuss the status of people like Mani (not being a real prophet) or potential prophets in China and Africa in order for the basic tenants of the religion to spread to those areas, in the time of Muhammad himself. In fact, Islam did just fine in most of these areas without any specific references to the revered personages of those areas.

If you're super interested though, I'd suggest an in-depth History like Tarikh at Tabari which will cite many Muslim sources for the so-called 'history of the world' which is more likely to fill the void you're looking to fill here.

 Well - from the video itself, it looks like he's deliberately making fast gestures which don't register while when he does it slower, it seems to work. The other criticisms of the device already mean I wouldn't drop a penny on it - but this particular criticism seems a bit self-wrought to justify how much he focused on it.
