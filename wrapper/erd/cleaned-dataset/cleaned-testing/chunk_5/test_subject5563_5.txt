 So guys what is your dream track no matter how unrealistic or unfeasible it seems. Mine would be Mt Panorama at Bathurst 




 Seriously this soundtrack needs to come out right now, I can't wait until the 18th. 




 Murdoch says no. 




 I can't ever see this happening to ND since they aren't a publicly traded company. Plus after The Last of Us, Sony are most likely giving them free and creative reign over their future games.  




 My download speeds also fluctuate especially if I pause and unpause to see if it changes 




 So was the bad guy in Quantum of Solace a legit threat now? 




 Hopefully they fix the download speed issue, that's my only issue I have had post 2.0. 




 This is really good man, keen to see more of this! 




 Honestly after watching World War Z, i'm surprised that bikes aren't common sense.  




 Yep same here, it's either BMW, Merc or Audi. 




 I'm pretty sure its taken from the [Force Unleashed 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umX_8cllRc0) commercial.  




 Damn I was actually starting to like this show :/ 




 I gotta say the opening [Battle above Coruscant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWoGkrt5Upg) in Revenge of the Sith still to this day makes my jaw drop.  




 fuarrk dat music. 
 




 I feel if I owned this car that I would be way too terrified to just leave it parked on a street.  




 This post kind of reminds me of the Batman Arkham games. The amount of damage Batman does to these people, they would have to be fed through a tube for the rest of their lives. Just remember Batman doesn't kill, he just turns them into vegetables.  




 Great work. Is it common for a 335i to not come standard with navigation or the screen at least?  




 [Seeing it in this bad boy on friday](http://hugontour.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dsc02331.jpg) 




 Pretty sure that this is the least of this film's problems.  




 Well in a recent Star Wars rebels episode it is shown that a lightsabers length can be adjusted on the hilt. 




 Yeah this playlist has outstayed it's welcome. Not only did they lock it to German cars but they locked it to like 4 german cars.  




 I think it will sell well, obviously won't do the same as the last gen version but I still expect it to be one of the top selling current gen games for the year.  




 Are they releasing a stand alone film in between Ep 7 and 8? 




 You realise you just spoilt the film as well, thanks.  




 Thanks mate.  




 [Put it in H!](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78503/2672773-3570061943-tumbl.gif) 




 We really need private lobbies so we can just race friends or do proper club v club races..  




 I am not really tech savvy on the animation side of films but can you explain why it would be twice the work to render it at a higher frame rate?

 




 Is there a link for this video? 




 So after seeing both Hobbit films in 48 frames in the cinemas, it got me thinking as to whether 48 fps is better suited for animated films? Would it look to strange? Since there is no live action it can't really look that fake right like the first 2 Hobbit films? 




 Thanks man, kind of reminds me of the AC2 opening, the music is pretty amazing so far as well.  




 MS probably want Skype on as many platforms as possible as they would get royalties from it.  




 Video doesn't exist, is there a mirror anywhere? 




 Looks like a younger Amy Adams.  




 Brazilian fear factor had some great plot as well.  




 The film was apparently way over budget and was completely edited and re-shot at the behest of the studio. The original film had Keanu Reeves in a smaller role and Hirouki Sanada being the main character. Did you notice how the [poster for the film had that tatted up guy holding a gun over the shoulder?](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/47-ronin-freak-poster.jpg) Yeah he's in the film for about 10 seconds, the original director was locked out of the editing room after the reshoots were completed. It's a shame because I think the film has glimpses of awesomeness and fantastic world building but ultimately it was corporate greed that most likely got in the way of a potentially great film.  




 Wouldn't be surprised exactly, after all we got a teaser for Intestellar pretty much a whole year before release, it seems way more likely than a Batman V Superman teaser since that film comes out in 2016. 




 The film should be viewed as is. 




 Sorry if I missed the explanation but how is Gordon able to afford living in such an expensive looking apartment/penthouse. Is it Barbara's penthouse? 




 What the hell, my game doesn't look that bad...Here are some direct captures from my PS4.

 You will find that almost all racing games have reduced image quality in the mirror since they essentially have to rerender an image twice as well as keep the textures in place from popping out as you drive along.  




 Where are you from OP? I just turned 23 this month and am in no hurry at all to settle down. I guess it also helps that everyone my age or around my age feels the same, hell my brother who is 28 is in no hurry to settle down either.  




 Seriously how do people not save their work in this day and age? How is the auto saving not working for these people? 




 The fastest way for me is still using my phone through the PS app. 




 Does anyone here know of EVE Online? It's a massively online multiplayer game made by CCP games. Basically it's a huge sandbox universe in which the stories that happen in the game are basically player created. Basically the events that have happened in the game combined with the rich background lore would essentially make it the Game of Thrones of sci fi shows. Here's a link from [Variety](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=2 ved=0CCMQFjAB url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2014%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Fhow-the-eve-online-tv-series-could-become-the-next-game-of-thrones-1201088301%2F ei=2d9NVLWCM-XvmAW6vICABA usg=AFQjCNE64EaRrCvoMjp_E8RNGK73AACayQ sig2=hKdhYogOI1vquWr5fckE0A bvm=bv.77880786,d.dGY cad=rja) explaining what I mean.  




 The one with the Rock. The Legend of Hercules was supposedly rubbish.  




 A completely CG animated film would be quite expensive. Look at Final Fantasy Spirits Within, that was completely animated and cost a boatload of money and performed very poorly at box office and basically undid Squaresoft and forcer them to merge and become Square Enix. Now this was back in 2001, so maybe CGI has gotten cheaper to produce but I think the investment is still too much compared to that of a live action film. 




 So do you guys think that a main entry AC game will ever be set in a  future setting. Navigating a busy metropolis or perhaps a very futuristic city. It kind of seems like Watch Dogs was more of the present setting with Chicago but I think a good AC game can be made if they set it in the future. Picture a city like [Coruscant](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080610031227/starwars/images/5/5c/Coruscant_at_night.jpg) from Star Wars and sneaking into a super tall skyscraper to take out your target. Just a thought I would be keen to hear your opinions on an AC game set in the future.  




 You're not alone my friend. That is the only film to this date where I felt incredibly empty at the end, not in a bad way but a that's so fucked up kind of way since nothing good happens at the end.  




 I wonder what story idea they were going with in [This](http://i.imgur.com/GLf8cFh.jpg) concept. The star destroyer crashing onto Mustafar.  




 Man I loved the opening title credits for AC2/Brotherhood and AC3. 




 Damn I graduated from Macquarie Uni in September and it won't accept my email. 




 I think BMW have been outselling Merc and Audi. 




 Tron Legacy 
Oblivion 
Gravity
Edge of Tomorrow 
Avatar 
Star Wars Episode 3
Prometheus
Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises

Make sure you check out the Blu Ray versions of these films.  




 Don't worry our man Jeremy Clarkson already punched him for us. 




 So am I just missing it or has there not been that much marketing for the final Hobbit film? We only have one trailer and the film comes out in less than 2 months. Compared to the last 2 films at this time of the year, there was tons of marketing for both films where as this film still only has one trailer out.  




 Is this in Sydney? 




 Wow that was a surprisingly good teaser. Looks really cool. 




  Just adding my 2 cents on the topic of Borderlands' sense of humor. The very topical, reference-based, irreverent, self-deprecating, over-the-top style is definitely NOT for everyone. For my money (and personal sense of humor), Borderlands is the most genuinely funny game series in existence. I think it's funnier than most 'funny' shows and movies. Absolutely brilliant writing, IMHO. You can tell that the team at Gearbox LOVES games- there is just fan service after fan service littered throughout

Yeah they love games so much that they just outsource the ones they don't want to make to other teams and pretend it wasn't their fault.  




 Yeah sorry I am going to have to disagree with you. Most of the humour is either just a reference to pop culture or shoe horning some meme into the game. It's a fun game but the humour is not the best imo. The funniest game I have personally played is still Portal 2. 




 It does seem like they have decent trunk space, at least the coupe does I think. They seem like they are one of the more practical luxury cars on the market since they aren't super low or have huge body kits and they also happen to be super comfy inside.  




 It really is! Michael Mann is for me one of my all time favourite directors and his choice of music is spot on in every single film.  




 afaik the xbox one version suffers the same issue as well. I think the PC suffers from it a little bit but nowhere near as bad as the console versions.  




 [God Moving Over The Face of  The Waters by Moby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTunCVWzkFA) for Heat (1995). 




 And the exact same plot almost.  




 [Stark Salvation by Geoff Zanelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SajsLpKU7s0) :) 




 Same here brother, I just want to see Daft Punk. So i'll probably be 40 by the time they tour again haha. 




 I love that he became the CEO of Sony. 




 Anyone here from Chico that can explain why I can't bring my friends to Chico? 




 Does the fancy looking dash and instrument cluster actually work? 




 I wouldn't call this a feature but the UI is so smooth and snappy that it pretty much made me like my purchase. Of course the games are great but having a UI that is reponsive and doesn't lag makes it worth while.  




 I quite liked the film as I really enjoy these corporate conspiracy types of films. The cinematography is truly amazing as well. Great wide shots of buildings and architecture to make the corporate world truly look imposing. All in all I felt it was film that may have been overlooked when it came out.  




 Yeah I am really hoping they put private lobbies in soon, I just want to race my friends only, not these muppets who spin you out in the corners.  




 Love the piece, I really love the idea of futuristic races. Wipeout is a great inspiration for my imagination when it comes to that topic.  




 Driveclub makes it fairly loud, the last game funnily enough to do it was actually AC4. 




 Damn, upper Hengsha would truly have been glorious to look at :( 




 I remember Spielberg being attached to direct this at one point, he would have done an amazing job. Especially if you look at his Minority Report which has a slightly similar aesthetic.  




 Spec Ops The Line 




 It very well may be coming since most of the online functionality is restored I think. 




 God damn why couldn't this guy have written the screenplay... 




 What was the repair issue if you don't mind me asking? 




 Hey all I was wondering how to ONLY race my friend in the same club. Not really up to racing with 10 other people, just a classic 1v1 race. 




 Sick run, congrats! Haven't played the game in a day or 2, it's nice to see that the leaderboards are functional now. 




 Is there a gif set for the Jedi code? 




 Just play Colonial Marines, huehehehe. 




 Just curious as to why you are selling it? 




 It's worth it, I only drove on it myself for the first time on Saturday! Make sure to drive through the Royal National Forest and through to the bridge. 




 I literally drove on this for the first time on Saturday, truly breathtaking.  




 As blatant as it was, it didn't really make me cringe since his character is known to play games to unwind.  




 Wait really, I thought every country had power switches... 




 Same, played through it all to see what the fuss was about and it really was nothing to go and proclaim it as GOTY material. I don't even hear it brought up in many discussions. I guess for me it was the equivalent of an oscar bait film. 




 [Better quality of how it looked in film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLy7wZeqa4) I think the F35 actually looks quite good in the film, especially when it hovers in under the overpass to block the truck. It looks quite real in that situation, not that it would ever happen but at least they went to the effort of making it look real with the model instead of using CG. 




 GT is designed more for a wheel in mind than the controller. 




 "One of" 




 Fucking love everything about this film. One of Cruises best performances.  




 Damn what a dissapointing film that was haha, great teaser though. 




 dat enigma soundtrack... 




 Haha no worries, I was in Year 7 of high school when I first saw that teaser and to this day it was still my most re-watched teaser. 




 Personally for me it's a toss up between [Star Wars Episode III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKZMI5tYq3s) and [The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA). Such awesomely edited teasers that really got the hype train going. 




 Bought the PS+ upgrade since it was the cheapest  for me $56 AUD 




 It's kind of frustrating for me as someone who actually caved and bought the PS+ upgrade as the servers still are fucked. Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed the game a lot but those servers being down really dampens the experience. 




 I'm just curious as to how you figured the cost out that it's $9k/hr. Not doubting you, just curious is all.  




 What do you think this means for the future of BMW? Can we see more crazy cars coming from BMW to compete with newer cars like the AMG GT? 









 I would say the Grey had a very misleading moment in a trailer. I don't want to spoil it but it's pretty crazy.  




 Mines attached to a card and it shows the same shit as well, so annoying. 




 So strange seeing a holden with a vauxhall badge or chevy badge. 




 I meant the PS+ version delaying it for a while then releasing it with an explanation afterwards.  




 Damn, at least the came out and said it straight. Better now than saying that later after it was released. 




 Gonna need a source on this. 




 It could be the EU versions of the game which tend to have more languages files.  




 Kind of what I was expecting, still picking the game up regardless. It seems like a game someone is either going to love or hate, much like Alien Isolation. I think that's fine in my opinion as the game is aiming to capture a specific audience of car lovers rather than appeal to the more open world type of racer that's quite common these last few years.
