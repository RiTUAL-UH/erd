 Fair enough.  And if you want to really outsnob the Beefheart fans, tell them that Lick My Decals Off Baby is better than TMR.   




 I've been listening to it for decades, and think it's brilliant.  I don't see why I can't enjoy both outre music (Captain Beefheart or Ornette Coleman) and power pop (the Kinks and Matthew Sweet are a couple of long standing favorites.) In different moods I want to hear different music. You don't have to take a side. 




 Education is only mandatory through 16 in most places, but every state I know of provides free education through 18 (or completing high school.)  It's generally held that it's in society's interest to provide education beyond the age when you can drop out of school, and as the world demands more skills, I would argue that extending that further would be in our best interest. 
If Walker is saying that public investments will pay for themselves, like helping finance a public stadium, it seems  that education returns the investment several times over.  Look at the relative incomes of places like Mass or NJ , which spend many on education, vs Mississippi or Alabama, which skimp on it. (Funding public education is really one the oldest debates in US History. Places like New England have always favored spending heavily, the southern states have always opposed it.
I don't know the details of the endowments, but places like UW Madison are also (research centers)[http://www.warf.org/about-us/background/history/history.cmsx ] At least in Wisconsin, it looks like there is a pretty good return on the money.  




 That's hilarious.  Although I'd change it to read 'A wholly owned subsidiary'. 




 50 years ago baseball was the national pastime and boxing was highly  popular. Tastes change. 




 Sure we have a number of unnecessary regulations.  But what's really gone wrong with America's economy is  the movement of wealth and income to a small minority at the top.  This is a side issue and a distraction.    




 After feeding them and taking them to the doctor, I think providing an education is the most important thing a society does for its young people, and for the society's continued success.  Cutting education funding is a foolish economy.  An uneducated society is not likely to be a thriving one.  




 Most of the cost is tax credits, subsidies, or near cash assistance.  




 Sure, why should we listen to the scientists about science, when we can listen to vote and money grubbing politicians? 




 Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's tradition of fine public education! 




 He seems to have his own [budget problems now](http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-faces-billion-deficit-heading-into---budget-cycle/article_5a3d6933-5937-5b23-8cd7-3bc16bf07edb.html). 




 Republicans complaining about income inequality is about as convincing as adult film actors complaining about pornography.  




 If there is one key lesson from the shale revolution, it is that public investments in technology innovation can bring a huge benefit for both the economy and the environment, said Michael Shellenberger, the president of the Breakthrough Institute, an advocacy group for sustainable development, in Oakland, Calif.

But since we have a political party married to idea that the government can't do anything right and "the market" solves all problems, good luck with this in the future America. 




 Please, please, please. 




 A weakened IRS is yet another way to push income taxes down.  If business owners and investors are routinely able to understate their income with little chance of an audit, their effective tax rate falls. Income earned through wages is harder to hide, leaving them taxed on their true income. Why the Democrats never make an issue of how Republican anti-IRS policies enable tax cheaters, I can't understand. 




 Wait, this guy can make Republicans shut up?  I don't care what his politics are, that's a needed talent.  




 Yeah but he was quoting Reagan misquoting Lincoln, so it's OK,  Cause it's Reagan. 




 They're mostly Fox news viewers, who share that level of awareness. 




 You can currently get [40/1 odds](http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/us-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=791149) on Bobby Jindal winning the Presidency,  Anybody else think this is a ploy for attention and funds? 




 Don't set standards you can't meet yourself, Ted. 




 Mitt Romney might not be awful, but who knows?  He's reinvented himself so many times,I have no idea what he'd do once he got into office. But I'd take my chances with him over any of the other current aspirants.  (Except possibly Rand Paul.  He seems a bit of a wild card as well.) 




 Americans for Prosperity is for the prosperity of a very small number of Americans.  




 The rest of America truly needs to live more modestly.  We have billionaires to support. 




 Hope you're wrong. Suspect you're right    




 Nah, he's got a sense of humor and realizes that his side can make a mistake.  He's not going anywhere in the Republican Party. 




 We have a responsibility, said Representative Jackie Walorski, an Indiana Republican who wanted the legislation rewritten, to protect the most vulnerable among us and ensure that women facing unwanted pregnancies do not face judgment or condemnation. She has a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee.

Holy crap, a Republican Congress member who doesn't see every moral issue as black and white. Maybe she'll start a trend. 




 I doubt she's going to make getting rid of subsidies 'in a fair fashion' one of her priorities as a Senator.  I expect she's going to remain 'philosophically opposed' to subsidies,do absolutely nothing to upset the Iowa farmers, and find other government handouts that must be curbed.  I'll be happy to be wrong (thrilled even), but I ain't worrying about it. 




 Talk about your 'no-go' zones. 




 He's got a point.  Here are some more of [God's Laws](https://www.gci.org/law/sct01) we're neglecting. 




 If that were the typical conservative response, I would have less of a problem with it.  But usually they claim to be champions of free enterprise, but find a reason for an exception for themselves or a favored group.  (Paul Ryan on the bank bailouts is a particularly egregious example of this.)  And when something they don't like gets a subsidy, say alternative energy, they throw a fit about favoritism and crony capitalism.  (And I realize I'm generalizing. I'm aware that there are reasonable ,thoughtful and unhypocritical conservatives.  But you can hardly hear them because the Rush Limbaugh , Fox News etc conservatives have taken all the air.) 




 Just look at what has been the first order of business for Republicans after they won full control of Congress for the first time in eight years this past fall. Its not expanding the earned income tax credit, but rather pushing a Wall Street wish list for tweaks to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.

Somehow, I'm not wholly convinced of Ryan, Romney, etc's newly found concern for poverty and the middle class. 









 But that's different ... because conservatives always claim their government handouts are 'different'. 




 To think Wisconsin used to be known for clean government ... Scott Walker has sure turned that around. 




 Still, I don't think it's fair to call these 49 Senators anti-science. I'll bet everyone of them believes in gravity. 




 OK Rand, put up or shut up.  Get some legislation on the table and vote on it. See how much support you get from your Republican colleagues. 




 Not being a scientist is not an excuse for being an ignoramus.  




 Guess those English speaking Americans can't be told the truth. 




 I think there will be a political problem for the Republican Party going into 2016 if we dont define what we are for on the environment, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Roll Call in November. I dont know what the environmental policy of the Republican Party is.

I thought it was saying, 'I'm not a scientist'. 




 Looking at the accompanying chart, I'd say the American public needs to get a clue.  If it does, I think changes will follow quickly. 




 Paul Ryan, please take special note. 




 "For the most part, they are conservatives who have criticized other Catholics in the past for disagreeing with definitive statements in papal encyclicals." said David Cloutier, a theologian at Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland who specializes in the environment. "They're scared that the document is going to say something definitive that they can't agree with. That will put them in a very difficult situation."

Soon as we get a liberal pope, conservatives start challenging his opinions and authority.  Who saw that coming? 









 How about Claudius?  After all, none of the other Roman Emperors managed to get their own [television series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Claudius_%28TV_series%29) . 




 I think the goal here is not the tax cut for the middle class (which isn't going to happen with the current Congress), but forcing the Republicans to show who they're truly concerned about. 




 A bad memory seems to be the first requirement to be a modern day Republican leader.

 When at the center of the system there is not anymore man but money, when money becomes an idol, men and women are reduced and simply instruments of a social system and an economy characterized, indeed dominated by deep imbalances. -- Pope Francis

 Don't be too hard on yourself. I'm certain that Britain, Spain, and France  would have figured out how to exploit Africa, Asia and the Americas even without Portugal's good example. 




 [Congressional GOP candidates are cashing more checks signed by Wall Street than ever before.](http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/03/investing/election-donations-wall-street-republicans/)

I'm thinking this is not a coincidence. 




 Low wages are not structural, they are not inevitable  they are choices, Tom Perez, Obamas Labor Secretary, said at an AFL-CIO event last week.

If every populist, liberal or conservative, understands this, we'll start seeing real changes.  




 It seems to me that Obama has had at least as much 'real' job experience as Paul Ryan, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means , who is the Republican's leader on tax policy.  Check out [Ryan's job history] (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/a-look-at-paul-ryans-career-on6eh4g-165824706.html).  The one job he's had that isn't in government or politics?  He was a 'consultant' to Ryan Inc. 




 Every time liberals propose something that improves wage earners situations, the right wing press and politicians always argue that it will  reduce the number of jobs available or reduce their wages.   









 While wages and incomes have stagnated in the United States (as well as in Japan and large parts of Europe), they have not done so everywhere. In Canada, a broad measure of incomes has risen about 10 percent since 2000, even as its fallen here. In Australia, its up 30 percent  .... What are Canada and Australia doing differently? For starters, they are doing a better job with mass education. They have near-universal preschool, and they both do more to get low-income students through college. In Australia, college is free. Increasingly, the report says, a college education is similar to the high school education of the past  necessary for a prosperous life.The efforts to create a more skilled work force in Canada and Australia (as well as Sweden and some other countries) have led to better jobs  and stronger pretax income growth.
Beyond education, these other countries do more to intervene in the free market on behalf of the middle class and the poor ...Middle-class stagnation is not preordained. No country has found a magic bullet, but many are doing some things better than the United States  and have the better results to show for it.

So which party in the US supports these changes to end middle class wage stagnation ? Doesn't sound like the Republican Party platform to me.   




 Why does anyone believe [anything](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/statements/byruling/barely-true/ )  Paul Ryan says?  




 His argument to his former supporters, says one who spoke with him, is that he came very close in the last election against an incumbent president with a good economy. ... (Romney ran against Obama arguing that the economy was terrible; now its health in 2012 is part of the case why he should run again.) 

Can anyone explain to me why we should believe anything that comes out of Romney's mouth?  Or Paul Ryan's for that matter? 









 Most community colleges include 2 year programs that are aimed at specific careers, and those programs are [included in the proposal](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/01/08/president-proposes-make-community-college-free-responsible-students-2-years). 
I'm not sure if it's true nationally, but every place I've lived you can leave school at 16. But we've decided to offer free education a couple years beyond the compulsory minimum, because we think it's worth doing. Adding a couple more years would probably help our economy even more. 




 Damn.  Just when you think you've seen the limit to hypocrisy, somebody pushes it out further. 




 Republicans are opposed to wealth redistribution.  Unless the direction is up. 




 No, I think it's more of a cultural division.  For centuries the Northeast has always been a high tax/high service approach to government and the South has taken a low tax/low service route.  You get better schools with the former approach. 




 The fact that he backed off with some boilerplate statements doesn't really change my mind. In the Senate we have had an [unprecedented obstructionism](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/) of Presidential nominee, which doesn't indicate that the Republicans in the Senate where bent on co-operation.  
In the House we've a Representative yell "You lie" during the State of the Union Speech, and  the Republican majority used defaulting on the national debt as a negotiating tool, which is well outside the bounds of governance. I'm not arguing Obama is a saint, but again I simply don't see that where the blame is all on one side of the fence.  




 The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.

I don't recall any recent Democratic Congressional leader saying anything like this.  If I've missed it, please direct me to the source. Regardless, I fail to see where Obama has been any more unreasonable in his dealings with Congress than any other recent President.  And it seems to me everyone , Democratic and Republican, always complains that the failure to compromise is on the other side. 




 No argument with you, but unfortunately headlines tend to eliminate nuances. 




 What exactly has he done to alienate Congress?  And when the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal was to make Obama a one term President, why would you think all the source of conflicts are on Obama's side?  




 Not to mention the NorthEast provides a much better education than most the country. Why some many people can't understand the connection between wealth and income is beyond me.   




 That's an impressive accomplishment. I doubt I would have done nearly as well in your situation.  But I fail to see what the advantage is in charging tuition for community college, any more than to charge to go to high school.  There's a pretty good argument that "both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy" ([Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/upshot/the-roots-of-obamas-ambitious-college-plan.html). We need an educated workforce, and we should be doing every damn thing we can to make one.  




 [Or maybe not](http://reason.com/archives/2011/07/14/the-redblue-paradox). 




 Many community college students are juggling school, work and/or family responsibilities, so they may not be able to put the time in to earn top grades. At Community Colleges the 18-19  year olds attending on their parents' money are the exception.   




 Like most conservatives, all in favor of local control until someone passes a law they don't like. 




 But both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy.

Skimp on educating the young and you'll pay the price several times over. Cutting education funding is both mean spirited and short sighted.

 One of Bin Laden's aims was to [weaken the US's economy](http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/).  Who knew a Republican Congress would work so hard to help him achieve his goal? 




 No, it's correct.  He just left off an adjective, it should be 'alternate reality-based scoring'.

 Who will Scott Walker blame Wisconsin's lousy economy on this time? 









 Private charity couldn't handle the needs of the poor in the U.S. for many years prior to the Great Depression.  During the Great Depression poverty became too widespread, and touched too many formerly middle class people to ignore.  




 Is this something that actually happens?  Frequently? 




 Karl Rove defends rectal feeding ... Some jokes just write themselves. 









  ...dismal wage growth is not just a sad but inevitable outcome of an efficient economy. Instead, its the result of a bundle of intentional policy decisions that were made precisely to shift economic power away from low- and middle-wage workers and towards corporate owners and managers.

 The author didn't include the environment in the list of winning progressive causes.  Which is probably the most important one of all. 




 Meanwhile Democrats, who should naturally have the upper hand in any honest fight for the increasingly populist American electorate, were too busy running away from President Obama to embrace the effective aspects of his agenda. As Andrew Sullivan wrote on Election Night, If you wonder, as I do, why Democrats never actually defend their policies or even achievements in power, and run solely on some poll-tested social issues, then your bafflement will likely only increase tonight, as mine has. The New Republics Alec MacGillis noted that in the three states that saw the biggest coverage gains under ObamacareKentucky, Arkansas and West VirginiaDemocratic Senate candidates shied away from pointing that out. And all lost badly, MacGillis tweeted.

Do you think the Democrats will ever offer the electorate a real choice?  Or are we in for more years of 'not quite as horrible as Republicans' as our alternative? 









 Yeah it  was pretty goddamn disappointing.  Do they really think it's not worth their while, or do they really think there is no difference?  But there's nothing else to do but keep trying to get them to show up.  (More of them will in 2016, almost assuredly. ) They'll vote more when they get older (everyone does because they realize how much politics impacts their lives), and hopefully won't turn so goddamn conservative when they age.  Or maybe something will energize them.  Minority vote was low for a long time, and now it's picked up (some places African American voting participation is higher than among whites. 
I also try not to put too much blame on anyone group. A whole lot of the democratic coalition didn't show up, not just younger people.  Why working class whites never figure out they're electing their worst economic enemies and keep voting Republican, I'll never understand.  And why the Democrats don't draw the contrast between themselves and Republicans in sharp focus, I don't get either.  If they did, they might get a few more young people excited about voting for them.  









 In the collected tales of AE Coppard (can't find an online link), when Johnny Flynn prays 'Oh God, make him give me a penny tonight, only a penny: make him give me a penny, please God. Amen.'
