 When I saw Cloud, I felt like I was in a cloud or on a cloud or near a cloud or... just wow 




 Actually it was my first one, but I really enjoyed it!

 I have to say Jarhead. There's no other movie that comes close to expressing the frustration with day to day military life, all culminating in a chance to actually do something meaningful and then getting denied the chance to do it. 




 Alien microbes. They obviously have to be sentient, but who knows? Maybe microbes from another planet are like a foot long on Earth. 




 When I first awoke I was alone in a forest. I didnt know my name or where I had come from. I saw strange boxes all around me, creating shapes of things that I knew to be familiar, but with dimensions that betrayed the sense of form that was buried somewhere deep in my memory. As I wandered I became aware of the delicate nature of the world, seemingly shifting from towering hills to sprawling desert and blackest jungle on a whim. 
	
The only constant that remained in all of this was an ever-present symbol that stayed in the center of my vision no matter where I went. It always seemed ahead of me, yet I could not believe that it was something I had envisioned. No, it was a beacon, a guide, a powerful force that showed me the one place that I could have any control over the world. It was my guardian, my protector, and my shelter. Without it I would not have survived the night and the creatures that came scratching, bellowing, shooting, and teleporting in numbers far greater than I could have guessed. I owe it my life. This symbol has given me everything, and to it I now build this monument, a cathedral to stand the testament of time.
