 Giving OP gold is a little 'mainstream', wouldn't you say?  ;)  Grazie! 




 Anything from particular vernacular, socially constructed issues, etc. 









 As for the story itself, it was entitled "The Dancing Fool." Like so many Trout stories, it was about a tragic failure to communicate. Here was the plot: A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and how cancer could be cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing. Zog landed at night in Connecticut. He had no sooner touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the terrible danger they were in. The head of the house brained Zog with a golfclub. - Kurt Vonnegut from Breakfast of Champions 




 Good afternoon Mr. Pyne.  I'm a writer who wants to take the next step after finishing some spec scripts and treatments.  Whom do I bribe to get my scripts in front of those with clout?  My Simpsons script has at least 4 good jokes.  (Two of which I did not steal)  Thank you for your time and consideration! 

P.S.  Yes, I definitely have Doc Hollywood on VHS.   




 Conspiracy hound assemble!  Can be about the NFL in general, a player, the media, whatever.  Just something NFL-related. 




 The narratives, hopes, and flat out errors that you tell yourself for whatever reasons.

Edit:  Feel free to include lies your fanbase tells itself.  Doesn't just have to be self-delusion. 




 Feel free to back up your facts with evidence.  Feel free to back up your opinions with facts and evidence.  Be honest and have fun!

Edit:  Your facts and opinions can 'depress' your fanbase if you want as well.  'Piss off' is just a suggestion.  Looking for negative emotions. 




 They may currently be in the NFL, a star Point Guard in the NBA, your parents' mailman, one of the Olsen twins...  Doesn't matter.  Just pick someone who isn't an NFL quarterback and tell us why you'd like to see them play.

Edit:  Feel free to pick the teams that play and describe what you'd think would happen. 




 Give it your best shot.  Kind of like Oswald.  Or not Oswald?  Mysteries!   









 Pictures are welcomed. 




 I'd watch the NFL more if they changed Washington's name. 














 We're talking true schadenfreude.  Just seeing them fail, be embarrassed, lose, etc, etc makes you heart sing.
