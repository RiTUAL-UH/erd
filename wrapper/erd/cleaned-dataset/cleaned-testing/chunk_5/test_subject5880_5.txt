 The afc system seems to cause misreading on the resistance.

Me and a friend were stumped when it came to this problem. However, we found that he was not adjusting the airflow. He was loosening the 510 connection - and this caused the trouble with reading resistance. Screw your 510 tight, and look for a little notch to turn just outside the circumference of the 510 connection ring. There is a separate notch there for adjusting the airflow - not the flathead screw 510 connection.

 Yeah, probably. I don't think 75% of the events posted on reddit actually happened. They are still interesting to read. 

 The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.  




 There was a confession bear on advice animals about a person who had watched as the remote connecting person logged into an account (on the client computer) to transfer the money, and as soon as the host opened up the accounts, the client killed the remote session and completely drained the host's financial account.

Sorry for referring to permalinks, reddit mobile made it hard to copy the full comments back and forth. 

No thanks needed, I'm happy to be able to share some knowledge on my favorite hobby!  




 Yes. It's remarkable. That's why I bought one. That was not my point. If they were bumping up the wattage I'd expect them to bump up the voltage as well - otherwise I don't really see a difference between the 50 60 




 Still only goes up to 10v. Doesn't seem like that'd be right.  




 Happens to me. Pretty normal.  




 Is your 510 pin on the Lemo tight?  




 If you keep the wattage low, you can surely run the protank on your istick. The beauty about  these regulated mods is that while you can run them at high power, you can also run them at the same voltage that an evod battery would put out (3.7v).

There is a known health issue with formaldehyde which is hypothesized to happen when you run a lower quality tank at higher wattage, so if you were to run that protank at 50w, you may risk heightened formaldehyde levels in your vapor. Dr. Farsalinos Konstantinos hypothesizes that heightened formaldehyde levels can be caused by devices whose wicking speed can't keep up with the heat of the coil - so if you're getting excessive dry hits, you may risk formaldehyde production.  




 Even if the tank doesn't crack, these liquids can decompose the polycarbonate plastic of the evod tank, so you run the risk of vaping broken down plastic that has leeched into your Eliquid.  




 Where did you purchase from?  




 The 50w has two cylindrical 18650s as seen in Pbsuardo's review 




 Yeah, mech mods are one thing you don't want to cheap out on. You really need that high quality machining and butter smooth threads or you're gonna have a bad time.

Good luck!  




 Sup, guy. Found you.

 I never said that I thought it was in one take. Ive watched a few videos in my day, I understand when something could be one take and when it may not. Regardless of this, it's pretty cool.  




 Additional note. The parts you want to separate are the two metal rings - the one with the tiny pinhole and the one above it.  




 Yup. When I saw this video, I must've replayed this part 20 times over.  The sound of the hit and her smashing through the glass is just fucking awesome. I don't remember whether this video was World Star or had something to do with Ferguson.  




 This is incredible. I really wish I had gotten high before watching, would've blown my mind.

 Met Chris Hesse of Hoobastank years ago. Very down to earth guy. Would talk about how he could walk around the crowd before a show and no one would harass him because no one paid attention to the drummer XD. Incredible drummer, great guy. We brought a couple motorcycles down to meet him and have him ride with my father from show to show, and he'd always offer our family free tickets to any show around us. When he wasn't busy with touring and music, we used to play Halo online with him and Doug as well.

 Hi there!

I spent quite a bit of time last semester and on my own before that point researching electronic cigarettes. My research project for my college english class was on vaping, so I've put quite a few papers together on the subject. If you'd like, you can find my paper [here for viewing or download](http://www.mediafire.com/view/5ev46znw9etboyk/ResearchPaperFinalMyVersionComments NamesRemoved.doc). (Please note that if you're viewing in Mediafire's document viewer, the pictures are going to make the essay look like shit.) It's a Microsoft Word file hosted on Mediafire. All sources are cited.

Also, I found one really solid source from CQ Researcher to be the most helpful in finding a lot of my information. It's not free to access, but if you'd like, let me know and I can probably get you a copy of the article. It'll essentially have everything you need. 




 Hey, man! Last semester I did mine on vaping as well. If you'd like, I can send you some of my papers. All sources are cited, and I got an A- in the class.  




 What is MBV going to do? Damn.  




 Damn, sun.  




 Their major complaint is that it draws in kids. 

So does smoking. Science says that if you start smoking after the age of 18, that you are much less likely to become addicted. People start smoking at a hella young age, but you never thought about banning cigarettes. 

One thing I noticed about vaping is that it blows smoking cigarettes out of the fucking water. After you make the transition from smoking to vaping, you cough up all that loose shit in your lungs, regain your smell and taste, if you try to go back to cigarettes, you're going to have a damn bad time. You WILL feel that tar again in each and every single drag, and you will most likely not pick smoking over vaping after that experience, and while knowing that vaping doesn't feel that shitty. 

These kids aren't going to pick up smoking from vaping. If they vape, they're not going to smoke, because it's simply not nearly as good of an experience. Vaping renders smoking useless. 

We'll learn to tell our children not to fuck around with it even if it has awesome flavors, in the same way we tell them to do that with alcohol, even though it has awesome flavors. If parents and teachers engrain into these kids heads to be vape free in the same way they tell them to be drug free and alcohol free, they'll be afraid of it until they reach age.

I just don't understand how these politicians can so blindly, all over the country, outlaw something they know absolutely nothing fucking about. It enrages me.

 Hi, I'm test_subject5880 and I had an electronic chip implanted into my brain to alert me whenever SmogLA makes a post or comment with the words "iStick" or "50W." 




 Things on reddit don't usually make me laugh anymore, but this definitely did.  




 That's TN for ya.  




 Incredible.  




 For what it counts, I ran both this image and the cropped injury image through three different reverse image search engines and came up with no results, so it doesn't appear that this image has been posted anywhere else that is easily accessible. 

I still don't know that I believe the situation, as a user of only mechanical mods I've never had any dangerous experiences, however this doesn't seem to be simple copypasta. 




 I only get a gag reflex/almost throw up when my vape gives off a dry hit (when there is little to no eliquid on the heating coil that vaporizes the eliquid, and you're instead heating resin/cotton). Maybe the vape you are using isn't very great? 




 I recommend getting your round Kanthal from here. They are the creators of Kanthal, and offer the best prices with free shipping.

 Hey, just a heads up on Spew by Gwar. It tastes absolutely horrid at first, but if you let it steep, the flavor of the Eliquid takes about a 90 turn.

 You are my first,

I can barely breathe

I find you fascinating

You are my favorite,

Lay you down to sleep

It's all that I can do to stop... love...

So blue, so broken,

I haven't left you yet

So cold, subversive,

Your eyes are full of bleach

Tomorrow I will go away again... love...

YOU ARE MINE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE,

I CAN TEAR YOU APART

I CAN RECOMBINE YOU

ALL I WANT IS TO COVET YOU ALL

YOU BELONG TO ME

I WILL KILL YOU TO LOVE YOU (LOVE).

 Inaccurate poster. I don't think the FDA "approves" any form of cigarette. Also, the chemicals diacetyl and formaldehyde (toxins present in cigarettes) are produced by electronic cigarettes at a "measurable level", even if it might be insignificant.

 Ohhhhhhhhhhhh my god [10] 




 Aren't bright lights/flashes dangerous for a newborns eyes up to a certain # of weeks?  




 Should've just decreased the sensitivity of his joystick.  




 I'm sorry to hear that he is dealing with all that. I asked if he had started medication, because I remember that certain medications can really send you spiraling downward and have you throw away everything good youve got in life.

Is there anyone else around him that you can get involved? Parents/family/friends of his that can just make sure he isn't completely withdrawing socially? I know you said he's against the idea of therapy, but from what it looks like he struggles with, I feel he could definitely benefit from it. Is there anyone that could convince him?  




 Shhhhhh 




 Right there with you. Bummed out, sad, and perma-tired, with nothing to do and no dependable friends to make plans with. 

Maybe you can roll blunts and play with kittens :)? 

Best of luck with what you're going through.  




 Why do you want to?  




 Hi friend, fellow college student here. It's a horrible testing struggle-filled time. You said youve got an appointment for a therapist and that is EXCELLENT and very crucial to overcoming this. The one thing I was thinking reading this, is that if you can't afford therapy, does your college by chance have a free therapist on campus? Most do, I believe. 

As far as medication goes, it can make or break you. One thing you can expect is for each and every medication to have a radically different effect on each and every person. What works for one person can increase depression in another person. I wouldn't recommend starting an SSRI during a really busy time in school, and until you feel comfortable with your therapist. If you have a break coming up in college, try starting a med exactly 2 weeks before that break. You'll start to see a change in how you feel on an antidepressant after that 2 week period, and in the case that the med affects you negatively, you then have time to work it out with your therapist outside of school. 

Best of luck! Let me know if you have any other questions.  




 Yeah, I'd recommend giving him some space on this one. If he's saying those things and treating you poorly, I'd let go of showing support for a bit. 

Has he recently started any new medications that you can think of? This is sort of really important when it comes to depression and life changing decisions.  




 Medication and therapy -  but more so therapy, have more benefits than one could imagine. Very, very helpful. Never in my life would I have thought that I'd have such control over my anxiety, and for a good period of time after I quit the meds and graduated therapy, I felt absolutely normal - depression free. 

It's definitely worth a try.  




 You might find a more educated answer in /r/drugs or /r/mdma

Personally, yeah. I've heard of Molly and X affecting serotonin levels, causing sleeplessness and depression.  




 If you are more depressed than ever, try a new medication. Buproprion (wellbutrin) worked for me in terms of depression, but spiked my anxiety and eliminated my ability to eat anything. 

Generally with antidepressants, there's like a two week period where your mood will slowly start to change. If you feel after that period like you want to end your life, and you can't really pinpoint why, it's definitely time to come off that med. 

I've tried about 8 different meds (SSRI's don't work for me either), and this has definitely become my rule of thumb after I've had some dangerous low moods on a couple of meds (citalopram and sertraline)  




 Your problems are just as significant as everyone else's. Don't be down on yourself. Everyone has a different threshold and spectrum of emotion - one person's loss of a family member can feel like another's stub of a toe :) 

Welcome, and Good for you for getting on here and venting. This is really the first step to getting it out of your system completely.

As to why she might admit that to you, I don't know - that's pretty low of her to do. If you are the only real person she talks to about that stuff,  she might have that real lack of judgement and just want to share her exciting new experience no matter how much she's stepping all up and down your feels. 
She could also be testing to see if your jealous. 
She could also be heartless. 
Many possibilities, and I hope it works out for the best.  




 Hey. You're not in the mental state to be able to make the biggest decision in your life right now. It's natural for liquor to make you want to kill yourself, especially when you are mixing it with other drugs. 

I have an idea for you. You want to commit suicide, I understand. But why tonight? If you commit suicide tomorrow, it will have the same result. Why not wait 24 hours or more, and at that time, see if you still want to make this decision. What's one more day? 

I think that if you allow yourself to go to sleep tonight, that you're going to wake up tomorrow with a completely different mindset - free of the liquor and the pills. 

I've been where you are, friend. I know how it feels to have that sudden onset sadness and strong urge to end your life, but it's NOT you talking right now. It's the liquor and the drugs, man. As soon as they wear out of your system, you're going to feel differently.

You CAN DO THIS! Please hang in there.  




 There is no need for apology. I understand how it is! Is there anything you'd like to talk about?  




 Horrible, nasty, waste of time finale. They couldn't get Charlie back on for the final episode so they made an animation of him to fill in, reamed on him horribly the whole episode (making jokes about how he's psychotic, fucks goats   men) , and then killed his stunt actor again at the end of the finale. They attempted to break the fourth wall (too many times) but it was with horrible meta jokes that either no one got or highlighted how much the show actually sucked.
