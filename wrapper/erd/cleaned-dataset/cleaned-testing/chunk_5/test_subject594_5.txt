 [Here you go.  Not really rare, but pretty hilarious.] (http://staygoofymyfriends.tumblr.com/post/110935760098/surprisebitch-weavemunchers-so-real-delete?utm_campaign=SharedPost utm_medium=Email utm_source=TumblriOS) 




 "Let's talk this over, it's not like we're dead..." Okay.

"Was it something I did?  Was it something you said...?" This barely makes sense, but I'll go with it.

"Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead..." YOU ALREADY SAID DEAD IN LINE ONE AVRIL GODDAMN IT.

"Held up so high on such a breakable thread...." Redundant.  Get out. 




 My current bathroom is tiny (for those of you that have ever played the Sims, it is literally four squares, meaning that your Sim couldn't use the sink).  I can't actually make it any bigger without cutting into the nursery, turning it into a closet essentially.  There is a multi-piece stall shower in it that leaks and isn't connected to the walls.  When I take a shower, it's like having water dumped on my head since it only shoots about a foot above my head.  Basically I have a bathroom from hell.  If I had 100k, I would add onto my house so I could put in an all in one-piece acrylic bathtub-shower combo, I would replace all the floorboards under my current set-up. I'd make sure my walls had cement board in them (my whole bathroom is hollow dry wall, I'm not even kidding).     




 Really any time someone changes a pronunciation to force a rhyme.  The most common offence being changing "Me" to "May," I'm looking at you, Hinder, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, N*SYNC and like a million others....  




 Lol, no... I'm pointing out that what she said was in no way definitive.  She said "I like..." not "I MUST HAVE OR NO HOW NO WAY..."   




 I like guys over 6ft.  




 I think this pretty much says it all, man: https://twitter.com/teknogeisha/status/576023004318212097 




 I use tarot cards as a way of bringing my subconscious or uncomfortable thoughts into the forefront.  A lot of times we have a sneaking suspicion we know the answers to things, but we don't want to admit it so we push it down.  Tarot is a gentle prompt to confront those thoughts and examine your motives.  

Even when my cards seem to make no sense to me initially, after a minute I'm always able to apply them in some new way that forces me to use a different viewpoint.

I don't really believe in fortune telling, but I do believe they're a valuable psychological tool.  




 I have no idea why there is so much discussion on "female-condoms," they have a higher failure rate and I've only ever even SEEN one in sex-ed class.  Probably a jokeshop gag/10.  




 Urinating.  I can't be the only person who laughs to themselves when they nip off to have a piss.  I think it's probably only enjoyable because you get a moment alone to laugh about how much fun you're having.  




 Well up until that point, I'd been going to my family doctor.  At that time I weighed about 95 pounds and I'm only 4'11.5"... so my doctor would use the smallest speculum she had.  This appointment was at a Planned Parenthood a state away.  Those duckbills were fucking comparable to a damn Swingline stapler before they were even open... I'd never seen anything like them before or since.  Also, I'm not quite sure what she was doing down there, but it didn't seem to me to be business as usual.  It felt like she swabbed me (read: scratched the hell out of my cervix) at least four times.  




 During the worse pelvic exam of my life (I felt like my organs had been rearranged for three days after), the GYN said "Your cervix is a nice bubblegum pink color... it's beautiful!  DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?  I have a mirror!"  

Like no, you crazy bitch, take that speculum out and let me slink off to cry in my car.  




 [The hand.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/94/6e/11946e7cde1c46bf18dd2eea7d1ad18d.jpg) 

I went into some sort of minor obsession with this damn picture in which I would save it to my phone and then delete it like five times a day.  Just when I thought I'd kicked it, my mom picture mailed it to me.  




 [Messiah of Evil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071396/)

This is available on Amazon Prime.  I have two versions, one was included in some 50 Horror Movies compilation and the other was the directors cut.  Of the two, I like the grainy one... It's that poorly mastered version you'll find on Amazon.  Hold onnnn to lovvvve!  




 This re-press is actually from Germany, not the UK as was theorized in /r/vinylreleases It's pressed on 180 gram vinyl.  There are no liner notes, but it does come with a digital redemption code.  Considering the original is about $250 on discogs, this was definitely exciting for me.  I hope this helps someone! :) 









 Every time I re-read "Far From the Madding Crowd," I find it gets funnier.  Hardy is so prone to flowery prose that I only recently got just how often he's speaking to us with his tongue in his cheek.  This novel was never a school assignment for me, but I can definitely say after four read-throughs, I get more out of it each time. :) 




 I was scrolling, there were flowers and pictures of food and then all of a sudden there was dead Chris Farley.  Now I am sure that a lot of my distaste had to do with being ill-prepared for that moment, but when you see someone that you felt you knew and liked looking like that, it's a much bigger shock than some random person you never saw alive.  




 Nah man, I added you to my friends list.  You're pretty consistently angry sounding with a dash of sincere and well-meaning.  I mean, how often do you post on some unoriginal question some smart-ass crack about how often you've seen some variation on that question 12x today?  I think you do it on average five times a day or so.  If you don't believe me, click on your username and imagine you're reading it all for the first time.  




 Say the words "You're right, I was wrong."  Not to me, but you know, if someone says that and means it, especially in the workplace, it counts for an awful lot.  




 Well, and I was clearly wrong, but I thought so because I remembered you posting something about being a Vietnam Vet.  Now clearly that never happened, but you know, the grouchy persona doesn't help.  You're cranky like a much older man.  You're also very well written and sharp as a tack.  You don't see that too often during the early twenties... It typically comes later.  




 Watch it pal, you'll be my age in three short years. ;) 




 Do you mean "A Serbian Film?"  What the hell is a Syrian Film?  Is that about oil?  




 Not anymore, young'un.   




 What was that stupid movie about the guy trying to track down the source of some dead guy's snuff movie?  Whatever it was called, it would make a hysterical musical.  Would watch/10. 




 Obviously you would send them [the hand](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/94/6e/11946e7cde1c46bf18dd2eea7d1ad18d.jpg). 




 Are you for real?  I'm OLDER than you.  It's a good thing I admitted to running Mac OS after all.   




 Is it bad that my first impulse was to NOT tell you that I am running Mac OS so you wouldn't find me even less attractive?  Because it was, and I am.  




 When I have new updates, it slides out a little sign over my other windows, that's not the weird part... the weird part is that right in that box it asks me if I want to just never update my OS again.  I hate that window so much I almost do it every time.  




 This is so fucking honest it's actually heartbreaking.  




 My mom would always get put out if we paid too much attention to her when she first came home.  I totally know that feeling now.  Like, let me set my stuff down and take my shoes off!  




 Go forth!  Spread the gospel of the downstairs mixer! Ahahaha!  




 Goodness, do you think so?  My intention was to insinuate that you would never be so shallow to take a trait such as extreme flexibility as the biggest asset in any relationship, and the assumption was that no one who had ever snared such reluctant quarry would let him go.  




 If you had a girlfriend who was flexible enough to tie herself up so severely she needed medical intervention, I wonder why on earth you ever left her?  Did the novelty wear off?  Or are you insinuating she was a light-weight?  




 I want to hear anything you have to say to me. 3  




 I call my lady bits my "downstairs mixer" which is a bastardization of the "downstairs mix-up" of Old Gregg on the Mighty Boosh.  




 If you actually said to me that you were going to make me love you, I'd probably laugh in your face Bathsheba Everdene style.  I want a man who can tame me, but I don't actually believe that's possible.  The only way I would be upset with a man for saying such a thing would be if he was panting.  Or had broken in.  Otherwise, I'd admire his pluck.  




 Technically I could be a catfish who likes angry old men because I am one.  You never can tell.   




 I'm going to make you love me.  Anne Boleyn is my spirit animal.  




 I'm glad that no one disputed this is the perfect crime. 




 Probably because you're capable of playful DnD banter with historical references, but if a gal says "throw it in reverse for thirst" (A stupid Sprite commercial reference), you curse her to a life of celibacy.  We can't be all things to all men, sir.  




 Guess I failed that bluff check, should've put more into Charisma. _ 




 Why, yes!  Yes, he was!

 Just in case you were lying awake wondering what ever happened here, it turns out I need a new motor. Thanks for trying to help. :) 




 [If you Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG4mmjeunC0) by Tal Bachman.  He's just fucking strolling around all happy with his girlfriend... the song is about visiting your SO in a mental health facility after a suicide attempt, with the eventual outcome that they succeed a second attempt.  What the hell record company?!  




 That was pretty hostile, man.  You don't have to call me a dick.  An alternative would be to educate me.  Novel, huh? 




 Jeremiah Johnson:

Goes to mountains, family dies, kills a ton of Indians, gives up.  




 I'm not a dad, but I am a mother to a seven month old daughter.  My husband had no prior experience with babies, in fact, the extent of his interaction was to hold his niece one time for about three minutes.  But he is the most wonderful father I've ever seen in real life.  He is always asking me to show him things and explain them and then he just runs with it.  He's more patient than I am, he takes photos constantly, and he brags about her to anyone who will listen despite being shy to the point of never speaking in most situations.  

The fact that you're worried just goes to show that you're going to do a wonderful job.  If you were a bad father, you wouldn't care.  Congratulations, daddy!  




 If they were a toddler, I wouldn't even hesitate.  




 Okay, now I have to ask... I've seen you around, and I've typed this question to you three times and deleted it each time... Is your username a reference to the Stephen King short story?  I think it was called "Strawberry Spring...?" 




 Did you just guilt gilt me?  I mean, I'm like, super excited, but wow!  You didn't have to do that. 3 




 Warren Zevon. 




 Absolutely! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A.

Edit: Sorry, use this one, more to the point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._(song) 




 No, it's really not!!!! It's about how we mistreat Vietnam vets!  You guys! 




 I think you need to rethink this... maybe read the lyrics once.  




 elliptical  




 A sports talk radio station (or as I like to call it, AM Radio Lite), I don't really watch television, but maybe the Discovery Channel?  As I understand it it has a lot of variety these days.  The artist would be Ryan Adams or Neil Young.  Both are so prolific I can't imagine getting sick of them or not having new stuff to listen to several times a year.  




 "Oh my god, Whatever, Etc." 




 It's not too complicated, you just mix a bit of olive brine in with your cream cheese and add sliced green olives. :)

I don't put anything else on there, but some folks like a little mayo.  




 When I sneeze, I say "bless you" to myself.  It's important to also be polite... so I thank myself too.  

*Sneeze* "Bless you.  Thank you." 




 Cream Cheese and Olives!  




 I'd say my mother in law, but the truth is that I only think about drinking... I don't need to give her another reason to subversively criticize me in front of my spouse. :-/ 




 Copy-Paste from another comment I left, I think it applies here too: 

I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys. Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process. 

Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified. 

I didn't actually have any sort of conversation about this, I was just being awkward to amuse myself.  




 I'm not trying to be a contrarian, but "separation of church and state" is not part of the first amendment.  It was the causation for the meeting as noted in a letter by Thomas Jefferson that resulted in the drafting of the first amendment.  The phrase never made it in, it's not nearly so explicit.  




 High Fructose Corn Syrup 




 Right, he's either making an in poor taste joke about god topping or he's saying we're all supposed to be a unified and invested in each others' happiness... without clarification, there's no way we can answer...  




 Josephine - The Wallflowers - 506 plays.  :-/ 




 THANK YOU.... Now I'll be able to sleep tonight.  You're the best! :) 




 Look, full disclosure, I don't even get the joke I made.  I have no fucking idea what is going on today and how June 3rd is related to the PS4 or any other damn thing.... but I think I might have answered one of those questions seriously... it was vague, like "It's June 2014, what are you mad about?"   




 This doesn't bother me in the least, it's that the people I love will stop existing.  You never know another person completely, so when they die, all those things and all that potential dies too.  You're not going to care when you are dead, you will be dead.  




 Well, I should clarify, I guess... I'm not actually against bonsai, I was just pointing out that a lot of people thing it's something it's not, namely miniature trees.  They are full sized trees that have been manipulated.  I was just joking with that suave /u/satnavtomington

Do what you will! :)  




 Don't speak to me, tree mutilator.  AT WHAT COST, I ask you? 




 How has your life changed since June 3rd, 2014? 




 A bonsai tree is essentially tree torture.  Dwarf trees are pretty much a myth.  You just hack a normal tree half to death and then manipulate it if it survives.  If you want to learn about building a hobbit house, google "fairy gardens." 




 Yeah, absolutely.  Love is respect is a fucking cliche.  While you probably have both love and respect for people most of the time, you can absolutely love people you don't respect.  People who are lazy or victims or whatever.   




 Kind of lame.  I mean, I'm sure it depends on who you're with, but my particular fwb wasn't at all invested in making things awesome for both of us, only him...Thank god I come easily.  He also seemed to think I was at risk of falling in love with him at any given time, so he went to a lot of effort to talk about his ex-girlfriend.  Seriously man, I just want to get laid, I don't need to write a book on your ex.  That's not what I'm here for.  I have no idea what the hell he was worried about, I don't know a damn thing about him save for what he studied at school and the stuff he told me about Dana.  




 Obsessively read about this forthcoming thing.  Like the Jawbone UP3... I pre-ordered the damn thing back in November.  I googled it daily.  :( for those in the know.   




 The Late Night Grumbler is right... the last time I saw this, I threw it in reverse for thirst.  




 I just want to put this out there: I'm almost 30, and I'm more intelligent than my mother, but I'm still not willing to best her in any way, shape, or form, because she was so successful in ingraining me with respect.  There have been things that she has said to me that I know in my heart aren't true, but I still grapple with because she was the one who said them.  I truly believe that your parents are the closest thing to a God you will find on this earth.  

I absolutely think at my age I should be held accountable... but prior to 23 when your brain is done maturing?  I'm not so sure about that.    




 100%.  Being a man in a man's world would be amazing.  I have a whole list of things I would do.   




 And where were you when I was 21?!?! 




 It was actually because her husband had very bad insomnia and had to get up at 4:00am.  It didn't really bother me, I still had a choice in the matter, you know?  It just tried my ingenuity from time to time. ;) 




 Two songs:

[Fred Jones Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJDaKDpva2c) by Ben Folds Five

[It's a Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJNB8fXje3I)  by Neil Young

For the same reason, they're about how we're all shuttling on towards irrelevancy/death.   




 When I graduated from high school, I immediately moved out of state.  I came back two years later and lived at home for the summer before I started college and lived on campus.  During that summer, my mom had a rule that I needed to be in by 10pm or out until after 4am.  All my friends would go to sleep by bar close, so I spent a lot of time sleeping in the back seat of my car in the driveway or going to the casino or walking around Wal-Mart.  




 Man, this only applies to those of you not struggling with an existential crisis.  I WISH it was a matter of putting out or making food, that would make life very easy.    




 GREAT QUESTION.  My favorite dead word is "Ready-Made."  These days, it is much more common to smoke a "ready-made" cigarette than it is to roll your own, so no one points out that what they're offering is a ready-made, that would be redundant!   




 While you might be right technically, your contribution assumes that you want these rights.  As a married person, I can tell you that the tax differential is negligible at best.  You just need to do your paperwork.  If you have a Will and a DNR worked up, you don't need a marriage to ensure your SO is taken care of or has a say in when to pull the plug.  As for parenthood, I'm 100% sure you can find more women who want to have babies than you can men.    




 I'm totally confused by this question.  Like, not to be a smartass, but there is no logical reason for a non-religious man to marry in these United States.  The way I see it, it is the men who want to get married that are in demand, not the other way around.  Sex in the City confirms this suspicion.  

Confession: If I had a penis, I'd never even date exclusively.  What would be the point?  




 Nothing that can help your girlfriend, just things to help potential victims.  Post on your local Craigslist about what happened, put out a PSA on your Facebook, that kind of thing.  A lot of the people who are responding to this don't have a lot of money so they are desperate to believe they can live in a nice home with low rent.  The game is to steal identities, not money.   




 I had this total asshole of a boyfriend in my younger years who wore a specific cologne.  

Our new training assistant wears the same one.  I have to make a conscious effort stop myself from being short and rude with him.  I never talk to him for more than two minutes if I can avoid it.    




 I have a bit of experience with this kind of thing, and I have to tell you that in all likelihood, this person isn't based out of the US, you would probably be wasting your money.  The guy I was dealing with was working out of Nigeria.  This is the 2015 version of those e-mails we used to get in 2003. 




 Ryan Adams.  Even when he's being a total dick for no reason, there is a hilarious wit in his way of insulting people.  This morning I laughed until I cried reading what he had to say about Jack White's role in Cold Mountain.   




 Well, I've heard it said that your same-sex parent will set you straight and hold you accountable, while your opposite-sex parent will believe you can do anything and that you're the greatest thing ever.

I would imagine if I'd had a father (not my father, he was an addict and died when I was 12, but you know, a normal one) I wouldn't constantly be grappling with the self-doubt I got from my mom always telling me I'm wrong or that I'm confused or that I'm bringing things on myself.  I'm grateful she did, because I'm very successful and I have a strong sense of right and wrong, but I wonder what I would have been like if it had been tempered with a little of that blind faith that I'm amazing.  




 Well, the tallest thing was this derelict ski jump.  That thing was so tall when you looked down, you couldn't make out the faces of the people on the ground.  It also swayed in the wind and was cold as fuck up there.

The craziest thing isn't so crazy if someone hadn't seen us and called the 5-0, so we had to hide up there for the better part of an hour, lying down, trying not to giggle.  We used one of those round cement smoking waste things to climb up a lower overhang on a hockey shelter and from there managed to get up on the roof.  




 Look, I know this isn't anything special or original or really anything else, but any time someone sarcastically or seriously posts "You're the hero reddit needs" or "You're the hero reddit deserves," I usually start crying for laughing so hard.  I've upvoted that damn movie reverence all 23 times I've come across it.  




 I had to tell my 17 year old cousin that his mother had committed suicide over the phone.  He reacted with shock, saying something to the effect of "Nuh-uh...."  He went quiet for a bit and then asked me how it had happened.  

You just don't know how you're going to react.  I had spent almost a day trying to find his contact information, I found it and made the phone call and the moment he answered, I started shaking uncontrollably.    




 Heck yeah, get up and GO!  If I were a man, that's exactly what I'd be doing!  The truth is that you're a smart and talented individual who has drive and self-confidence.  When that is who you are, you will always land on your feet.  On you deathbed, I highly doubt you'll look back and say to yourself "Man I'm glad I never followed through on traveling more."  Go out and have fun for the both of us! :) 




 Don't panic!  You're troubles are probably 100% related to nerves.  Think about it like those couples who can't have babies.  They go to the doctor thinking there is something seriously wrong with them, but the truth is that they're both fine.  They just want to have a child so badly that their bodies are resisting due to stress.  It's probably just the same here.

You said you needed advice on what to do and what to say.  Here's what to do: practice being present.  Tonight in your room try meditating.  Sit down, close your eyes, focus on relaxing your whole body starting with your feet and moving up.  Tune out everything, all your thoughts, all the noise in your house, just feel what it is like to be in your body.  Notice everything, but focus and think about nothing.  I'm sure you've been having racing thoughts while you're with your girlfriend, the point is to practice in a low pressure place how to be in the moment.

Here's what to say: She's probably going to be hurt no matter what you say to her.  Go to the extra effort to tell her how sexy you find her and if she wants to talk about your troubles, I'd try to make it out that you're just so worried that something will go wrong you're sabotaging yourself.  

Good luck, I hope things work out better for you... just try not to worry, okay?  I'm sure there is nothing wrong with you.
