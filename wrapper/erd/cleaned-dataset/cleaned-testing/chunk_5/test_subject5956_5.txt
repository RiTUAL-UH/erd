 So you can spend the whole game ganking Miss Fortune bot, right? 




 I agree, its the only limited edition skin i have (regret not buying bewitching Nidalee.). At first i was worried that this skin would be better and i would have to buy i it, but from the looks of the splash art my wallet is safe. 




 Maokai mid, good burst with his combo and his saplings are a 100% ap ratio if you hit with both parts of it, and if you go against karthus your passive will be up a lot.
Cho'gath is another good mid because i believe rupture is also 100% ap, and feast is good burst when part of q w combo.
