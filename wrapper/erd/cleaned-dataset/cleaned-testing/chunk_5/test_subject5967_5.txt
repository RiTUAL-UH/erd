 Alternative title: How to Piss Off r/baseball in 5 Steps 




 In a playoff game too! Is this the same Clayton Kershaw?  




 I'll always remember him as the promising young second baseman for the Yankees. I'm 22 now and some of the players who broke into the league when I started following baseball are starting to retire. It's an odd feeling. Kind of like I'm losing a part of my childhood.  




 I just bought a slow cooker and have been using it a lot. I'll share my most successful recipes. Here's the buffalo chicken I made tonight.


Chicken breasts (I used a little more than a pound and a half)

One bottle of buffalo wing sauce

One pack of dry ranch dressing mix


Put the chicken in the slow cooker, pour the bottle of buffalo wing sauce on the chicken and then sprinkle the ranch mix on top. Cook on high for 4-5 hours, then shred with a fork.


Next time I make this, I'll probably use less buffalo wing sauce, maybe 3/4 of a bottle.  




 I've never used a pressure cooker, so I don't know. 




 I used a pound and a half, but more would have worked fine with the same amount of beer. 




 I put chicken breasts, a can of beer and some spices in my crock pot on low for 7-8 hours. That way I can shred it and save some for future meals. I made burritos with chicken, beans and cheese. Just wrap them in foil and put them in the fridge or freeze them. 



Give /r/gainitmeals or even /r/gainit a look. They're going to be high calorie meals because they're designed for people trying to gain weight, but people in those subreddits love meals that can be cooked in bulk and eaten later. 




 Get a slow cooker. You can get them at thrift stores for cheap. If you get a big one, you can prepare a week's worth of meat at once. 




 I'm trying to prepare meals in advance and I also just bought a slow cooker. Yesterday I made chicken breasts and put them in burritos. It was delicious, so I wanted to share the recipe.


Place chicken breasts in slow cooker.

Add one 12 oz bottle of beer. I used Stella, but anything should work.

1/2 tsp of paprika

1/2 tsp of basil

1/2 tsp of garlic powder

1/2 tsp of salt

1/2 tsp if black pepper


Cook it on low for 7-8 hours and then use a fork to shred it. From there, you can do all kinds of stuff with it. I just made burritos with beans and cheese.


If you're like me, simplicity is the most important thing in a recipe. If something takes more than a handful of ingredients, I'm not going to make it. You could easily do this with just beer and chicken.  




 Are those the originals or reprints?  




 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NL WEST CHAMPION LOS ANGELES DODGERS! 




 2014 is the sweetest. I've never felt as sick after a game as I did last night. That low made this high all the sweeter.  




 Dynasty! 




 Never seen him look even slightly interested in anything. 




 He's good and all, but he's no Bumgarner. 




 Someone turned the pitching sliders all the way up sometime in the 4th inning. 




 If my first kid is a boy, I'm naming him Madison. If it's a girl, I'll also name her Madison.  




 A good ol' fashioned pitchers duel with neither starter finishing the 4th inning. 




 George Brett finally getting around to reading Game of Thrones.  




 Ya know, I'll be fine with KC scoring one run for the rest of the season. 




 To be fair, the Giants' DP *was* spectacular. 




 In that commercial, there are 5 guys and one 6 pack of beer. No way that dude couldn't have driven home. 




 This has been the only competitive series this postseason. 




 Post history. You're one of the few r/Dodgers subscribers that I recognize by username.  




 I never thought I'd see the day when you, of all people, would be the voice of reason. 




 Clerks?  




 Time for Hudson to pitch the game of his life and ride off into the sunset with one of the greatest farewells ever.  




 I've never been this nervous for a game before.  




 Dude, that'd be gay. 




 When I read it, I imagined who I would cast in a movie version. Woland would be played by Johnny Depp in a combination of Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka. Ivan would be a young Matt Damon.  




 It's only the 5th inning and I've already gone through the stages of grief.  




 At this point, I'm just hoping the Royals shoot their wad tonight and have nothing left for tomorrow.  




 Where was she during the last 29 years! 




 7 days old? She wasn't even alive when this series started. What a bandwagoner!  




 I'm back in nor cal now, but I went to school in San Diego and went to a lot of Padres games. Usually when they played SF, but not always.  




 Seriously! He just hops on the hot player and goes to town. It's like rubbing salt in my wounds. 




 Ryan needs to help move that fridge. 




 Panik is the first evolution of Tyler Colvin.  




 It all started with a one out walk... 




 I'm curious about previous winners of this. Is it a good indicator of a team's future success?  




 EBay for things that can be easily shipped. Craigslist for large items. 




 I'm super happy for Juan Perez. Erin Andrews was reporting that he was crying in the dugout after hearing the news about Oscar Taveras. Huge moment for him. 




 That's what happens when I eat Taco Bell. 




 DAE Bumgarner??? 




 I should become a professional baseball player... 




 THAT'S THROWING LIKE A GIRL! 




 Kershaw better be taking notes at home. 




 Perez and Taveras are both Dominican. They were probably team mates at one point. 




 I just read Moneyball and he mentions players watching film of earlier at bats midgame. It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in the tunnel who told them or if someone checked their cellphone.    




 How much contact with the outside world do players have during the game? Would they know about Taveras yet?  




 They've had interviews every game this postseason.  




 Seriously, why can't he just smoke pot like a normal kid? 




 I'm sure they do by now. 




 Confirmed by whom? 




 In an earlier thread someone said Steve Perry probably has no friends and only comes to games to get high fives from strangers. I still laugh when I think of that. 




 THAT'S THROWING LIKE A GIRL! 




 I never thought I would say it, but I'd go with Strickland here. That means he probably won't pitch tomorrow. 




 I was feeling so down a few innings ago. Now I'm feeling on top of the world. Baseball will do that. 




 ...he's not 




 They either get super cocky or annoyingly fake humble.  




 DAE BIG 4??? 




 Why stop at 2010??? 




 0 rings since '89 is why we mock you. 




 I've had that feeling for 2 1/2 games. 




 Is anyone else annoyed by how Mo'ne Davis gets so much louder when she says, "That's throwing like a girl!" 




 Cain saved 90 feet there. 




 It's raining so hard my satellite signal is out. 




 ...and a(t least one) World Series ring. 




 It's a difficult game to win if you can't pitch or hit.  




 That's probably the last time we'll see Vogey pitch, at least in a Giants uniform. He had some great moments here. 




 That's what speed do! 




 Blanco has really stepped up in Pagan's absence, especially in this series. He's been getting on base and playing great defense.  




 The suspect is Marcelo Marquez, b. July 20, 1980. 




 The search seems to be narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents are not allowed to return to their homes. SWAT teams are searching homes.


This is right by my house and I went to high school at Placer, so I know the area well. The neighborhood behind the school has narrow streets with a lot of trees. It would be very hard to spot a suspect from a helicopter. Past the homes is the American River Canyon. This is really rocky terrain that would be difficult to maneuver quickly. However, large portions of the area do not have trees due to the once planned construction of a dam. If he wanders into this area, it would be game over. Crossing the river would be nearly impossible without being spotted by one of the helicopters.  




 Same here. Police blocked of an intersection right by my house. 




 Well, what happened?  




 Definitely northern California. 




 One officer, Danny Oliver, is confirmed dead. 


The search seems to be narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents are not being allowed to enter the area. 




 The search is focusing on Auburn, CA between I-80 and the American River Canyon. Road blocks are set up all over town. All Auburn schools are on lockdown.

Update: Carjacked vehicle reportedly recovered on Riverview Drive in Auburn. Residents reporting gunfire. This is several miles away from the high school, but very close to an elementary school. 2 suspects believed to be on foot. 


Update: One female suspect in custody. Second male suspect still at large.  




 I live in Auburn very close to where the police are searching. I'm on high alert right now.

 Police are blocking off an intersection less than a mile away from my house in Auburn. I'm looking out the window half expecting to see the suspects.

 Brothers, I come to you in a fit of rage. I had heard the fables, but until this morning I had never personally encountered a gains thief. 



I was doing warm up sets of deadlifts, hopefully working up to a new PR. When I sat down to rest between sets, some jerk comes up, doesn't say a word to me, and takes over my barbell. I'm sitting just a few feet away when this gains hog thinks he can just overtake my setup. He was pretty big, built more like a powerlifter with significant body fat, but also very strong. I was dumbfounded. So speechless I couldn't even stand up for myself. I just sat there, mouth agape and watched as this guy took the gains that rightfully belonged to me. I managed to take a picture of the guy. Hopefully he sees this and realize what a punk he is.

 The trash talk is between KC/BAL and SF/LA. 




 Timmy will always be a lot of fans' favorite Giant. Not just because of what he did from 09-11 or in the 2012 playoffs, although that certainly helps, but because of his attitude. He's never complained about being sent to the bullpen or not getting enough work. He just works and pitches when he's needed.  




 [My gamer dog is not enjoying this one](http://imgur.com/RVVnBKi) 




 I've never seen a player who has struggled on the field yet be so loved by the fans as Timmy is.  




 Lincecum like "that's how you pitch in the post season, Clayton." 




 I still have to get a lifting session in tonight. Looks like I'll have some anger to get out.  




 Strickland is just garbage. 




 Maybe the Dodgers should build a better team then. 




 Dodger tears are not PEDs.  




 Catcher  




 *Boorrrn free* 




 I'm still trying to find a tasty one. I put olive oil and seasoning on the chicken and bake it @ 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. For the rice I just use a rice cooker and add a little soy sauce.  




 $5 pizza night. Only works on mediums.  




 I don't think Yogi left a lane for the runner. 




 Poop is gains leaving the body. I don't bother.  




 I'm celebrating with [3 pounds of chicken, 3 cups of brown rice, 3 medium pizzas]( http://imgur.com/J3zU4Um) and leg day (not pictured). May the gains be ever in our favor. 




 This is probably a stupid question, but I'm clueless in the kitchen. Do you put anything else in there with it or just plop 5 pounds of chicken in there and turn it on?  




 I have about 3 pounds of chicken that I need to cook and I'm wondering what the best way to do that are. In the past I've baked it and I've also experimented with grilling. Do you have a preferred way of cooking chicken?


Edit: I'll contribute an answer to my own question. I just baked 3 pounds worth at 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. I put a little bit of olive oil and seasoning on as well. It's pretty tasty when mixed with rice.  




 Who at the KC Star rejected "A Giant Disappointment"? 




 Prime Lincecum?  




 I feel like Hosmer was the kid in high school who was more popular than you, better at sports than you and got better grades than you, but you still like him.  




 Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^goodnight 




 I gotta stay, the Giants fans in this thread are super annoying. 




 I know. Getting excited after a homerun in the WS? Sheesh...  




 Let's not compare Bumgarner to God. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Madison Bumgarner.
