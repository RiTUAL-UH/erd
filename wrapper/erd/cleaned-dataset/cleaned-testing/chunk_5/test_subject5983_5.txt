 If he's over 80, I think he's allowed to do that. 




 I thought the same thing during the theater scenes in Inglourious Basterds. 




 It made me realize how McCarthy-esque the whole series has been. 




 These interviewers sound like huge douchebags too. Apparently they only asked sex-related questions and ignored her music.   




 Oldboy 




 Burn After Reading is the best movie about nothing. And almost everyone dies. 




 Everything Wes Anderson. 




 Is the black guy the one that played Tracy's son that was older than him in 30 Rock? 




 I bet Jonah Hill's having a nice weekend.  




 Phoenix did an incredible job, but he's also been very verbally against the Oscars, which probably doesn't help his chances with the Academy. 




 RocknRolla, IIRC. 




 Carrell won't win. I doubt he'll be nominated. but even if he was, it'd be for best supporting actor, right? 




 Yes. 




 Uh...yeah, that's okay. I guess.  




 I....I can't tell if you're joking. 




 .... 




 Might wanna NSFW this. 




 I'd say it's pretty out of sight. 




 Don't be such a faggot 




 Note to Self: "Mantis Cannibalism" - Possible band name 




 Or that time he was a contestant on the dating game.

^^^that ^^^one's ^^^obscure ^^^as ^^^fuck 




 You won't regret it. There isn't a flawed performance in that movie. 




 RUFIO - RUFIO - ROOF - E - NO NO nonononononono 




 I got an early screener 




 Eh. Leave it.  




 Thank god. The pilot was atrocious. I watched it completely shocked anything that bad could've come from someone as brilliant as Mulaney.  




 Lets Play: Is It Racist? 




 Dude, Funny Games. How has no one said this yet? If you're cool with subtitles, go for the original, not the remake. 




 ...aaaand now he's listening to Katy Perry and fondling himself. 




 Finally, a crouch button. 




 Overlooked, not underrated. I believe it's on IMDb's top 250. 




 Phoenix - A$AP Rocky 




 i thought so too, but damn that picture makes it uncanny. 




 Anyone wanting to see one of the most amazing performances of last year (or 2012 depending on location) should see *The Hunt*. Mads Mikkelson is incredible in it. 




 Actually Kevin Smith just lost a shit ton of weight. He looks great. 




 That was great. 




 I'm trying not to judge, but I just don't get how you can think that. 




 What happens if you punch the shit out of a gypsy who tries to pickpocket you as a tourist? 




 Oh shit. 




 S/O to YMS. 




 Watch out, Ferret. You might get hit. 




 Cool. I don't care about my notoriety, so I am now Hitman Pearce. Fear me. 




 thx 




 Does "her" count? I think "her" counts.  




 I dont know how much time you spent writing that, but it was too much. 




 It doesn't on PS4 




 Art. 









 That's a few episodes of *Legit*. You should watch that show. Funny as shit and surprisingly touching. 




 i think so, as far as dark comedies go. It's hilarious. And super meta if you're into that. 




 Death At A Funeral, Fargo, Payback: Straight Up, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Man Bites Dog, and Three Kings are all dark comedies with the theme of death. Happiness is the darkest of dark comedies. 




 Ehh. Not really a comedy. 




 To be fair the original Saw was pretty good as a standalone horror flick. Once the original writers (who are doing this movie) left, the franchise turned into torture porn. 




 You should watch the movie *Downfall*. It's a German film about the fall of Hitler. It affected me in the same vein as this image, but 100x more potently. 




 I've always considered Casino Royale far superior. 




 I feel ya. It felt like an extended YouTube action short. 




 That was fucking cool. Hey OP, how drastically does your Reputation meter change? Can one lengthy police encounter seriously affect it? 




 The NPC's behavior in this is impressive. People getting their picture taken, checking their shoes for gum, scurrying in the rain without an umbrella, having realistic conversations and phone calls, all with just the right amount of population and street traffic. 

People who have it already, how repetitive is NPC behavior? And does their number increase and decrease with location and time of day? 




 No 




 The hair over the mask is the icing on the cake. 




 /r/ShitCosmoSays 




 Also just don't watch it if you have a penis. 




 Speaking of Cop AI, how is the wanted system? I hate to continue with the comparison, but is it similar to the GTA 5 star system? 




 You have really unique handwriting. I like it. 




 How's that inbox? 




 He does a stellar job in "The Hunt" as well. That movie is too damn tragic.  




 YMS did a great job explaining why he thinks it's a shitty horror film. I agree.

 That's actually someone's remix of the final product. 









 I love The Veldt. 




 Although to be fair, that would make more sense in this game on account of ctOS and all. 




 Holy shit. 




 Why 




 I hope they can get some real talent involved. 




  Autonomous Meridian Response Syndrome

 Basically it's a community of content creators who make videos of sounds that give people a non-sexual tingling sensation (similar to goosebumps, I guess). However, one of the most common an popular "triggers" of these tingles is an up-close whisper, which causes quite a few creepy comments on YouTube videos of girls attempting to help people relax.

 Subtrango for More Django 




 I believe it was for Brach's, the candy company. 




 Exit Through the Gift Shop (if that counts) 




 Prisoners. A million times Prisoners. 




 Brtish Actor to play the lead in The True American. Hm.
