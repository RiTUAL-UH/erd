 so you don't like British humour then, do you? 




 "I'm going to fucking murder your ass."

 whats voidspace??

Edit: heres  [$100$] now answer me, guy

 It's hardly a binge if you're doing them 1 a day ;) 




 Yes, that's true. People respond to incentives. But, a worker is going to resent a boss who is mean and therefore put in less effort, meaning said employer will not benefit. A, maybe overly, kind employer will be well liked and workers will be more willing to put in effort, both parties benefit.

See Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People 




 If he is a good employer, he'll give you a raise or a bonus or something. Employers that treat their employees like shit get shit employees as a result. 




 arm chair gynecologist, back to /r/theredpill with you... 




 This has nothing to do with gender, I never disclosed mine 




 am not who you directed it towards, you'll need to write up a unique diagnosis for me, Bartlett 




 you're obviously not socially awkward then, that's the point i'm making. who told you you were socially awkward?
also don't call me names, this is a civil debate 




 arm chair psychiatrist  




 same thing 




  some girls are attracted to socially awkward guys, just like some guys are attracted to socially awkward girls.

You're thinking of "quirky" people, not socially awkward people. The two often get confused. Social awkwardness is a mental illness that makes any social interaction unbearable - no one with it could possibly form any romantic bonds.

 




 and you have a husband. you're about as socially awkward as frank sinatra was. 




 STFU simon 




 socially awkward yet you have the confidence to scream and shout, mhm...

 I kinda see what you mean, but I don't see what you mean 




 Any examples? I never really paid much attention to his tweets. 




 Kinda sick of him having blocked me on twitter, aswell. 




 Yeah but you don't downvote OP in his own thread, that's just rude

 You either wake up soon enough to be a hero, or keep dreaming long enough to be a villain.  




 DAS DA DOKE DOT DAY DEG 




 Ah, my bad. Haven't slept :) 




 You'd go way too fast unfortunately  




 NO WAY DUDE 




 is that why Van Gogh cut off his ear? 




 What's wrong with WND? 




 so that's why Van Gogh cut off his ear? Huh. 




 I know, its just one of those things 




 I get him and Brandon mixed up so its for the best 




 RUDE 




 obviously not what he meant 




 trust me, guy. it bothers them 




 he'd make a good Patrick Bateman 




 Yeah. The cake would cushion the blow anyway, no way what we saw in the video would knock her out 




 wishful thinking, guy 




 it is, getting slamdunked into cake wouldn't knock you out 




 more like strippin is traitor 




 dont tell me who i've never heard of 




 not sure about him, but i do, english not my mother tongue
