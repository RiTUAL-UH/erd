 Tell the owner to go fuck himself. 




 Add Salazar above all else 




 Yeah there's plenty: Salazar, Hughes, McCarthy all solid. Pick up Tajiuan walker before tonight's game in case he goes lights out and there's a frenzy for him- you can always drop him if he sucks again. Keep an eye on Hutchinson for when he turns things around this season. 




 Yeah the imgur link you posted dosnt work. 




 I think he can, he's talented, and has power to hit 30 bombs. Problem for me isn't with him but with the brewers. The lineup just doesn't have a lot going on, without protection I can't see him succeeding. It says you're in an 8 team league, if that's what this is in reference to there's no way I'd roster him. 




 Then we're like-minded individuals. The name still carries cache though and there's plenty of ignorant owners that would deal for him thinking he's a good buy-low. 




 Sure, I'd take it 




 Hellll yes. Mets have a great rotation this year going to have many more save opportunities. 




 I think there's still trade value in Latos. He's in for a bad year, sooner you deal him the better. 




 I'd rather have the Edwin side. Edwincano and colegray. You'd def be upgrading over granderson, but overall I wouldn't do it. 




 Relax. Maybe check out r/meditation. Seriously differing opinions about this shouldn't get you so worked up. 




 See my above response to the exact same question you asked. I came to my conclusion using projections, I'm not claiming to be a fortune teller, just offering my opinions. If you "don't see valid reasoning", than by all means pick him up. 




 Projections I'm looking at have a line of 61/12/44/.287/6.  Assuming OP is in a league with 12 or less teams, he'll easily be able to find someone comparable if not better. Russell could turn out to be great, but it's his rookie year, right now he's just a hot name. 




 Owner A wasn't on top of his shit. It's not like this is a blockbuster trade. I agree it's unfortunate but vetoing anything outside of collusion is just babying the owners. 




 More than two weeks. See what sabermetric sites like fangraphs say about their success. Usually a pretty good indicator if their getting lucky or not. I don't know what Volquez's peripherals are like this season, but given how he's been pretty much every season before this, he's due for massive regression. Every year he starts out hot, gets a lot of Ks, everyone points to that one good year he had, mostly he just has a great baseball name. But the implosion is inevitable. I'd sell high, but who knows, maybe he'll live up to the name this year. 




 Knew about 1st base, but wasn't aware of LF. That'd be pretty huge, though I can still see him being benched against righties.  




 No. At Russell's best this year he'll pretty much be even with Elvis. Drop someone else for Russell  




 Yesssssir 




 Points league? Send him to the gallows! 




 Unless Rosario became an outfielder last night this pretty much has no effect on him 




 I don't think Crawford's turning anything around, and he's likely going to be platooning all season, dodgers have a notoriously crowded outfield. I'd rather have Davis in the OF spot. What other OFs are available? 




 It's not that bad, some people are super high on Wacha this year. Vetoing should only be used for collusion. 




 Chris Heston. That start at Colorado this week? He's gonna get clobbered. Plus Shoemaker will probably still turn things around  




 Not really. Volquez is pretty awful, and Russell isn't better than anyone you can get off waivers. You're essentially trading Trout for Stanton straight up. I'm sure there's some people that like Stanton more than Trout this year, and if that's you're thing than go for it, but otherwise he's just throwing trade fodder at you. 




 Trade 




 He's a mediocre player that moved to a completely deflated offense in the NL, no reason to own him in a mixed league with 12 or less owners 




 It's an illness, probably has diarrhea 




 Nope 




 Bingo! 




 Yes!!! Thank you! 









 Dude 100% 

Scooter looks terrible and batting 8th in an NL lineup is a death sentence  




 Would rather have Ross 100% 




 Buy buy buy 




 Signed in just so I could say how insane this is.

C'mon don't play dumb, might as well slap the other owner across the face. 




 Taijuan Walker, Jason Heyward 




 Start him 




 Fielder in a heartbeat 




 Don't do it. You've potentially got a top 5 1st basemen for the next three years that's not something you give up. Felix is great don't get me wrong, but as a general rule of thumb pitching is way deeper than hitting and easier to replace. 




 You're right. Since I made the post I looked up some analysis on him, turns out I'm severely underrating him. 




 I'd rather have Grilli. Cishek isn't very good and neither are miami's pitchers. 




 That's because you probably have a lot of experienced owners that have the long-term baseball mindset in place. Peeps get cold feet pretty quickly always worth capitalizing on it. 




 Tough choice.  Walker certainly has more security, there's no chance of him losing the job. That being said, I'd probably go Travis simply because he's in such a superior offense. 




 He'll definitely keep the starting job if he keeps performing like this. 2B is pretty horrible this year, and travis is in the perfect offense to succeed. Start googling him there's been a good amount of posts written on him. Optimistic he may be moved to the 2 hole, which would mean Bautista, Edwin and Donaldson would all be batting behind him. He's probably in the best position to succeed out of everyone at 2nd base

Edit: grammar. 




 Mind posting who's on your roster? You could probably get some opinions on who to add/drop/trade. Not that you have to act on anyone's advice but it may be helpful just seeing the type of logic people use when evaluating these players.

Best advice? Follow some fantasy baseball blogs. Should only take 10 minutes out of your morning just reading recaps of the night before. Great way to get used to the lingo, stay on top of current player trends. (Razzball.com is my favorite. Great analysis but also funny/well written).

For deeper analysis check out fangraphs.com. Take some time and search each of the guys on your team on their site, and usually there will be some current articles where they're mentioned. Great way to get to know the players on your team and get a gauge on what your expectations can be.

Good fortune! 




 EovaldiGallardoLewisJimenez.

Opinions on these guys are gonna vary quite a bit. My suggestion, look up some fangraphs articles on them and just roll with the two that seem most intriguing to you. 




 No benches 




 I'd make a big effort toward trading him, maybe package him in a deal. The name carries too much cache to just drop. 




 Tomas isn't going to start and Oakland historically keeps guys in the lineup who are producing  




 Canha is playing everyday in the 2 hole and mashing- totally worth riding the wave and seeing what he's made of. As long as he's hitting the A's will play him. Not only is Tomas a bit question mark but the diamondbacks manager came out and said they're using him as a bench player. Let someone else waste a roster space on Tomas 




 100% take him. 20 team league? He still most likely WILL break out his season, plus his next two starts are against bad offenses. 




 I'm starting him. And honestly expecting him to get lit up. At the end of the day it's a game and it's worth tossing the dice on guys you believe in. That's my rationalization anyway  




 Wow...you're my Santa today ak759 




 http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/trying-to-solve-the-alex-guerrero-problem/

This gives a pretty comprehensive explanation of the situation. It's unfortunate because if he was on any other team he'd be playing every day, the dodgers simply have too many talented players. 

The reason to be optimistic is that these guys are going to get injured as the season goes on, and there will be more opportunities for mattingly to squeeze him into the lineup.  




 Can't drop anyone else for segura? SS is pretty thin I'm sure you could find an owner that would want to trade for Andrus.  




 As much as I love segura this year I think you may be jumping the gun. Didn't Andrus have a homerun and steal last night? 




 Yeah unless you could somehow trade him I'd say he's definitely worth a drop.

No love for Pujols? He's at great value this year 




 There's no leash, this guy shouldn't be owned in the first place. 




 Think about how great you'll feel if he kills it? Risky move but nothing feels better than taking a chance and having it pay off. 




 Yikes, apologies for giving you a thoughtful response.

The most I would give up on my team is Melky Cabrera. That being said, it's an utterly arbitrary question considering how subjective each owner is in evaluating players. 




 This early in the season it's kind of hard to value guys, and an unfortunate consequence of that I find is that you can only really value them on the round they were drafted (as far as having a good shot of making an even trade). Let's say for arguments sake Tanaka got taken in round 6 of your draft; scope around who you drafted in rounds 5-8...if it's anyone you're willing to part with that the tanaka owner might want, give it a shot.

I realize you're asking for a specific list of players, it's just too broad a question for me to answer without knowing the context of the league/teams/scoring. 




 Relax it's two weeks in, just bench him. Some guys take a while to get in the groove when playing for a new team. 




 1) stop panicking he's had two starts.

2) drop him? Are you kidding me? Trade the guy if you don't want him. If you drop him you will be deservingly the laughingstock of your league.

3) pick up Archie Bradley just drop someone else 




 Definitely worth holding on. He'll be in the rotation in the next month or 2.
