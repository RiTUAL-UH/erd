 I am a little worried about the balance = weight variation.  I guess I could go on and off of it a few times to get an average? 




 Very cool, thank you for your input :)  My old scale showed body fat % but I like how aria shows lean body mass.  I'm lazy about it too.  Although I log my weight daily, I don't log all the other numbers.   




 Thank you for your reply!  I've never seen trendweight.com and was wondering what the difference was between their website and fitbit's weight graph. 




 Ms. Betsy looks like she could be our boy Neo's sister!! http://instagram.com/ohhallo

*edited cause of missing words lol 




 Lol now you know so much about me! Hahahha 




 I love eating kale in salads, but somehow when it's dehydrated into chips I get sick. 




 I waited and waited... ehhhh... you got me OP... lol 




 Hey guys!  I've been using FitBit since launch and love it.  I've been looking at getting FitBit's Aria but wanted to know how you guys liked it.  How accurate do you think the scale is in general?  I had a scale once that would change the weight every time I got off and back on... ehh.. lol.   How accurate does it measure the body fat % + lean mass%?  Any help would be appreciated :D 




 Kale chips are so delicious! But.. I find that I get digestive problems if I eat too many. Maybe it's the fiber but mannnn dangerouss.. lol 




 I'm not sure if you're going to see this.. but Jon Congdon was my 7th grade homeroom teacher.. LOL.  Please tell him I said hi! :D 




 The one where the Japanese Hooker shit in the tub and ate it.  It wasn't shown on camera but somehow it still made me gag.   




 I was just starting to fall asleep and then I see your comment and start to lol.  Freaked the dog out... Hahahhah 




 I smell nothing.  Is this just a guy thing? Lol 




 Cooking and baking.  I love to try new dishes at restaurants then try to make them at home.  It's like cracking a secret code lol. 




 Yup yup yup! 




 Ty Shauna!  He's a whippet! 









 My whippet never does this!  I always see photos of whippets on their backs but mine seems to prefer the " nose to the butthole " position. ... Hahahaha 




 Awww she looks so sweet. 




 My husband and I go to Vineland drive in and Mission Tiki all the time.  Check them out!  Mission Tiki's quality seems better but it's a bit of a drive. 




 Yes!  I'll order almost anything on the menu if it had aioli I'm it.  Dipping fries in it is like heavennnnn 




 Aioli!   




 I love this idea and the look of it.  My concern is that the swinging opening cover won't be completely spill proof and must be kept upright.  I would love to be able to put it into my bag like a thermos. 




 Thank you so much!  Yeah Mango (cat) is Neo's big brother.   




 Tell me about it.  I gave him 10-15 treats and then had to move him off so that I could close the treat bag lol 




 Thank you!  This was actually part 2 of the gifts I received from my SS.  I posted everything here. http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/sharknado-house-pic-heavy/ 









 It looks like it's quite the workout. 




 Um... Why is he fisting the male elephant?  I'm so confused...  Is he stimulating the elephant's prostate? 




 o.O 




 No matter what you do the rest of your life, you'll always be trash.  Go Lois 




 Awww look at that face :) 




 Because usually, they aren't kept clean.  I do think that for most people, long nails = feminine.  For me.. it's the cleanliness factor.  Applies to both men and women. 




 " Santa " wrote me a note with our post-it.  Then I noticed that his handwriting looked like my Dad's.  7 year old me did some interrogating and came to the conclusion that Santa was fake! 




 Awww her paws....too cute 




 A strong, reliable, and clean toilet.  The horrors you see when you travel.  Eek edited for bad grammar 




 The little mermaid!  Just watched it again recently and the ending still made me cry. 




 Having someone enjoy something I've made or food I've cooked.  Amazing feeling :) 




 I'm a good listener and can make people feel comfortable around me very quickly.   




 Deep breathing.  I start to take longer and slower breaths.  Dark curtains help a lot too. 




 Try using Tend Skin after you shave.  Also make sure you gently exfoliate the area as the hair grows out.  If you have really curly pubes it might be harder to get rid of bumps :( Try using Magic shave on it instead of a razor!  The silver sensitive can works quite well.
