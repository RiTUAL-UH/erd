 As someone who is dyslexic this is amazing 




 This is amazing you should also post in r/woodworking 




 I teach high school history and I have gotten some great simulations off of tpt. To me it is worth it to pay three dollars than to spend hours creating all the things I would need. But sometimes I just browse it for ideas, and don't buy anything. 




 So I should preface this with the fact that I taught the civil rights movement all week, but I had a dream that Malcolm X broke into my house to rape me , but I was totally into him so we had consensual sex and then I made him pancakes and we talked about environmental protection. 




 I love that I work with people who are intelligent and able to have an open debate and not get emotional or take statements personally. I love that I teach 155 kids about history , and I make it as interesting as possible. I love it when I tell a joke that only half the class gets and then 30 seconds later the other half gets it. I love seeing awkward freshmen bloom into young adults. I love it when a kids speaks their mind for the first time, when they have really thought a bout a subject and come to their own conclusion. I love that my job makes me want to be a better person everyday. I love that I get to be creative, that I push myself to do better than the day before. I love my VP who works his ass off , and checks in on the teachers, I love our guidance counselors who bend over backwards to get kids services, and make sure they meet graduation requirements. I love going to the beach on a random tuesday during the summer with a book. Teaching is an amazing important beautiful wonderful job, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world somedays  




 My first year I put in 12 plus hour days most days and worked weekends, but I had 3 preps so I always figured that was the reason 




 I have 3 in my classroom, but I teach high school. When kids look sleepy or figdety during class I will ask them to sit on the ball, I have lap desk that go with them. Students love to grab them when we do partner or group work, overall very successful I will buy more next year
 




 I very rarely drink coffee but when I do I take it black, simply because I don't want to try and figure out the suger cream ratio. Because if I am drinking coffee I am too tried to think. 




 Math science and sp ed get forgiveness and can teach anywhere , anyone else can get forgiveness if they teach in a high need area meaning a title one school.  




 Yes as a teacher this is true. Kids mix up numbers and letters all the time it is no big deal at 5.If you are concerned about how the teacher is working with your child call the school and ask to come observe for  a day. 




 Always pee before...always  




 Just breathe and know it will get better. Sorry for your pain 




 Allure salon, if you are more into pretty long hair, article 5 salon if you want something more funky , both are on king street. 




 I am teaching honors US history for the first time I have been giving my honors kids additional assignments, but I don't feel like I am giving them a deeper understanding of the subject. Any advice would greatly appreciated. 




 I teach at a small high school most teachers have 3 or 4 preps , but yes a new teacher should never have more than 2 




 We had a first year teacher this year with 4 preps and no prior education experience. I think he had a degree is bussiness and was teaching marketing type classes. He quit 6 weeks in he didn't realized what teaching would be like and   he didn't have the skills or support to push through it. It isn't for everyone, that guy was a smart, good guy who will be great at someone's company he just wasn't meant to be a teacher. The same way that I would probably crash and burn at a marketing firm. What others have said is helpful too take a day off ask for help, see what is on teachers pay teachers on days when you are overwhelmed with planning. It gets easier , but if you don't like it and it,s making your life miserable then getting a routine down isn't going to make you love it all of the sudden. Best of luck whatever you decide to do. 




 Maybe adding a bit more sugar would help with the yeastyness and help them produce more fluff. Just an idea, sometimes it helps when I make vegan bread.  




 For clarification, I wasn't suggesting that they were the same thing I was posing a question more about people's attitudes toward them. The vast majority of people now think slavery is wrong , I was asking if people might also feel that way about eating meat in the future. 




 This is a well.thought out responce. I teach US history, we are doing a unit on slavery and there are just so many parallels . Especially how abolitionists were seen as extremist, and mocked for their beliefs. I think that the move towards veganism will happen out of necessity of saving resources, rather than moral issues. But who knows the movement is gaining traction everyday and it is becoming more mainstream, so here is hopping. 




 Let me know how it goes 









 He looks like frank from donnie darko 




 Wake up at 6 at school by 7 class from 830 til 4 leave school at 6pm come home eat dinner grade or tweak lesson plans for an hour or so ...go to bed at 10 




 I teach us, government , and economics. For government check out the following websites I am on a mobile or I would link them icivics, the national archives, the library of congress and cspan. Start my government classes off with a news clip and we discuss the governments role in it. For us and world check out the reading like a historian website, they have some good lessons, also check with your media center to see if the have dbqs that you can use. Contact the socail studies person from your district and ask them to come observe you one day and give you some suggestions. I do a lot of hands on stuff but it kind of just comes to me as the year goes on. I had world students hold 30lbs and take a lap aroynd the room to simulate armor that a night wore. I had boys and girls put on high heals when we talked about foot binding. In us I have them make artifacts from the 13 colonies out of play dough, they build shanty towns out of cardboard boxes when we study the great depression, we simulate trench warfare when we study WW I . For govermnet you can run simulations of passing a bill by breaking students into groups and having them vote and make changes as they see fit. Hope that helps a bit, I didn't have much help my first year trust your judgment, experiment some days will be awesome sometimes it will be an epic failure, but you monitor and adjust and move forward. 




 What subjects do you teach?  Are you the only history teacher in the school? Part of your department head's job is to help you grow also reach out to other teachers in general they can give you some ideas you can tweak , good teaching practices can be applied to most subjects. 




 This most people know I am vegan , but will forget and offer me something non vegan I just say no thanks a 9 times out of 10 they remember why I don't want it and apologize. My friends are really accepting of my diet. 




 Omg I haven't had biscuits and gravy in so long thanks for posting 




 I am very lucky in the fact that I never much cared for steak, but if I smell a chicken biscuit or mac and cheese my mouth waters . I am from the south after all. 









 A high quality stapler, it sounds silly but it makes a world of difference.  




 As a graduate from the citadel, it is his class ring, the class ring at the citadel is more than just a ring it is proof you made it through four crazy difficult years. It opens many doors, cadets look out for each other it is a political tool for most graduates . Cadets always wear their ring , the school actually pays for 51% of it so if you disgrace the school they can legally take your ring away from you. 




 I have dyslexia and they look exactly the same to me 




 I teach high school and I convinced my students that Bill Nye the science guy name was really Bill Nye the science man.  




 Can confirm was a bartender for 6 years a rocks pour is 2.0 or larger depending on where you work, so it cost a bit more. 




 I find the difference of ideas between the founding fathers fascinating especially Jefferson and Hamilton. Ben Franklin was a bit of a scoundrel, so talking about him and peppering in some funny antidotes about his personal life would keep the lecture interesting. Like others have said know your audience.
