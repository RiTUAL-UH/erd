 Stafford has megatron back you can't be not excited about that. 




 Oh wow! Good find. you! 




 Stay away from Sanchez. Have trust in Russ. The giants don't have a good secondary. Wilson should be able to expose it. 




 Matty Ice is that guy you need. Especially with those bonuses. Ryan has one problem and that's his offensive line. As long as he can pick up the rush and get it out quick he will have another big game against TB. 




 Peyton is Peyton. You can only debate one QB over him right now and that kid is on a bye week.  




 Romo. Better weapons, weaker opponent and better quarterback. 




 Matt Ryan. Has huge potential for scoring here. Only problem is that offensive line. I like going for ceiling in close decisions like this. I think wilson is safer, but Ryan could score a lot.  




 Yeah I think Denver's D is underrated and Seattle's is overrated. Eli has been solid-good this year and I think he can keep it up. Surprising he hasn't dipped without Cruz. As a giants fan I can only wish Cruz never got hurt.  




 After this week Andre Williams. I just hope no one else grabs him up. 




 I would trust Eli here. I think he can the Seahawks secondary with OBJ. 




 Romo if you're looking for higher ceiling. Better weapons and going against a weaker team I think.  




 Go with Kaep. He was the better matchup with better weapons. It's close though.  




 Stafford. Calvin is back and that Tate/Johnson duo could be amazing. 




 Giants secondary is not good. Wilson will be able to expose it. 




 Orton. He's a much better QB than people think.  




 Vick was seen with a limp. Don't pick him up. Go with Eli. 




 Seattle's secondary is over rated I would go with Eli. 




 3-6 you need to take a risk. Sanchez is so bad in my opinion he's less of a risk and more of a sure failure. Go with Cam. 




 Cutler, yeah he's struggled against the Pack, but he has some damn good weapons.  




 Higher ceiling is Matt Ryan. Better weapons by far. 




 Honestly I like Romo here even with so much going against him. He still has the running game to protect him and Dez Bryant.  




 Stafford. Tate and Calvin on the field at the same time with Stafford and Tate's recent hookups could do wonders for Stafford. 




 Go with Ice. He is going against a weaker defense, he's the better QB and has better weapons. 




 Yikes, I like Carr, but Romo is the better qb even when hurt and has more weapons. It's an even tougher call when you consider that Romo had to travel to London. I go with Romo here. 




 Peyton. Peyton by miles. Andrew Luck is the only quarterback I think you should consider over Peyton.  




 I would go with Wilson. Yeah Matt Ryan had that huge game early in the year, but that was at home. Ryan has more weapons, but significantly less time to use those weapons. I don't think you can go wrong though. 




 Wilson. More skilled in my opinion and going against a worse defense.  




 Wilson, the giants are weak in the secondary and Wilson is the guy who can take advantage of that. 




 I would go with Cam. I think with Romo's injury Cam has much better upside.  




 Martavis Bryant at the Jets or Allen Robinson vs Dallas 




 Thanks, that what I was thinking. 




 Jay Cutler at Green Bay or Big Ben at the Jets 




 Should I drop Travis Kelce for him? 




 Denver at Oakland or Baltimore vs Tennessee? Standard ESPN scoring.

 We only veto trades that show collusion not one person drastically over valuing a player. It helped that he actually sent me the trade! He told me he wanted Lopez and I told him I wanted a point guard. He offered John Wall.  




 Traded Robin Lopez for John Wall last season 




 This will sound weird, but I definitely think strange clouds and adventures are better albums overall, but for some reason is only like a few songs on it whereas on Underground Luxury I really can listen to a lot of the tracks and really feel and relate to each one on some sort of level.   




 B.o.B isn't a top 5 rapper in my opinion and might be borderline top 15, but I really loved Underground Luxury. It had everything I really could hope for in a modern rap album. I think I'm gonna have to say Underground Luxury, but Illmatic, Food and Liquor and Graduation are certainly up there.
