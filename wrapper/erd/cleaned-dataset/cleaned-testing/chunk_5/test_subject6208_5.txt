 Man I wish I knew how to do custom covers. Those custom Harry Potter covers are sick! 




 It really sucks how the UK gets all the cool steelbooks. Really wish the US would get some. 




 Why? Out of respect? If so, why? I mean, it's not based on the Malaysian flight. Hollywood doesn't seem like the kind of business to really care about anything but money. In fact it's weird that they don't want to capitalize on it. Besides, this is a movie that probably wouldn't be released for another year or so. I don't disagree with their choice but it's strange.  




 Whether it be by telling you how it ends before you saw it, or pointing out something that you can't unsee or hear. 

What movie was ruined for you by someone else and how? 




 Honestly, I only think two of Kubrick's films are great. 




 I'd love to hear why you think Inglorious Basterds is one of the worst movies you've seen. 




 I agree with all of your points. Also, Tree of Life is one of my all time favorite films. 









 "Then I woke up." 









 I only know this from An Extremely Goofy Movie.  




 Haha well I just got off work so I'll get in contact with you in like an hour 




 You know what? I just might skype you. Are you available after 8? Cause I really do need someone to walk me through it in real time.

 I can't edit clips independently anymore now. Now I have to create a new project and drag the sequence into a new time line which combines everything. I can't adjust single clips and what not. How can I fix this? I don't want to re-edit the entire thing all over again!   




 FCP 7. I don't know what my sequence/project settings are or the export/master file settings.

I have run into another problem though. So on this project I have put 30 hours into, I accidentally closed the sequence timeline. Now the timeline won't open for this specific project unless I create a new project and drag the sequence into this new timeline. Problem is, when I do this it makes it all one big sequence where I can't see the beginning or ending of clips. I also have to re-render everything which will take two hours.

How can I fix this mistake? Can I even fix it? I just want to edit independent clips again without having to re-edit every single thing all over again. Did I royally screw up?

Edit: Never mind about the timeline thing. Fixed it! But I do still need help exporting. How do I check the settings? 




 So I shot something in 1080p 24fps. I've edited it and I'm ready for exporting. The problem is no matter what I do, it ALWAYS IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!! The aspect ratio is distorted and the image is blurry/pixelated. 

I've watched so many different tutorials about exporting, all with the same result, Bad Quality. For some reason I just can't get it to work. It's so irritating. 

The worst part is that I've exported a video that came out in high quality before, but I can't get this video I just did to come out in HD at all for some reason.

Can someone please, please help?  




 But you should watch "Them" which is a French film from like 2007 I think. Basically The Strangers in France however it is much much scarier.  




 What is this from 




 Links are more than welcomed! 

I was thinking about this while I was listening to the live version of Dave Matthews "Crush" and finding that I loved it more than the studio version. 

What are some of your examples of this? 




 Links are more than welcomed and are encouraged, but don't worry about it! 









 Spy/secret agent films. I love love love these kinds of movies. Unfortunately the only good ones we get now are really just Bond but I love this genre. 

More specifically I love mountain climbing movies like Vertical Limit and A Lonely Place to Die. We rarely get movies like this though which is a bummer. 

Someone already said this one so I won't go into detail, but I absolutely love crime movies. I'll almost always pick a crime movie over any other.  









 Honestly, Terrence Malick. He makes beautiful films with beautiful people. He's probably the only director who could seamlessly transition into that industry.  









 I personally just felt that it was very mediocre compared to the first and had bad cgi, bad cinematography and often hammy performances. 

The first one felt like a masterpiece whereas this one felt like a cheap direct to dvd sequel.  




 It was basically a four square shot of a stand up comedian's joke about Tiger Woods claiming to be a sex addict. The post seems to have just vanished 




 The majority of people think Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt is better? 




 Too bad it's also 10% as good as the first one.  




 It's weird we have to learn to protect ourselves from the very people paid to protect *us*.  




 So there was a story about I think a WWII pilot who was flying in the Bahamas and disappeared. They then found the wreckage off the coast of Florida and never figured out how he got there. 

I could be remembering all the details wrong, but that was the basic gist of it.  




 I didn't mention it but you are so totally right. 

The first 300 only really used cgi for the background, blood, and the cases where that's the only option(like the army of millions of Persians and the creatures) but even then it wasn't terrible. The cgi in Rise of an Empire felt very fake and a lot of the time unnecessary.  




 So I'm definitely in the minority here based on the rest of these comments. 

I found this movie kind of boring. I don't know why but I never got into it at all. 

The blood looked super terrible. I think it might have been worse than the blood in the first one, which evaporated in the air. Like it was very distracting how bad it was. 

The cinematography was mediocre. You know how that show Spartacus felt like a cheap rip off of 300 when it came out? That's how this one felt, a cheap rip off. I found it very hard to tell what was going on at any time because of the either too dark lighting, or too bright and bloomy lighting. 

I feel like this isn't hardly half the movie the first one was. I was more interested in this movie when it was called Xerxes and was about his origins which was only 10 minutes of this movie. 

All in all I thought it was very poor and a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite movies. Again, I know I'm in the minority here but these are just my thoughts on it.  









 If /r/truefilm seems intimidating, /r/casualfilm is a great place. Easily my favorite subreddit.  




 I was wondering when someone would say this. I've seen just about all the movies people have said in this thread. 

Martyrs is possibly the darkest and most depressing movie I've ever seen. It made me feel ill.  




 I really love movies where a character is constantly being hunted or is hunting someone else throughout the entire movie. I find that these types of movies make for some really suspenseful and thrilling experiences.

What some good movies like this? 




 I was thinking about this at work today. Are the some good movies where the good guy(s) and bad guy(s) end up having to team up for some reason? Maybe fighting a common enemy? 




 Yep this is it exactly 




 So this dude came into my work looking for crystal rocks and metal shavings. He goes on to tell me about the "____ in the air" How it's in the snow and rain and is like fiberglass falling from the sky. 

Anyone know what this is? What it's called? He kinda sounded crazy so he might not be accurate but when he said this one word, the word I'm looking for, I knew what he was talking about. He said, "Have you heard about ____?" 









 Wow this was totally my idea in the first place as a joke, but I'm happy someone is actually making it happen! Exciting!

 I honestly don't think anyone could do Archer. What makes Archer Archer isn't his looks, it's his voice, which no one could do.  




 Note: I have not seen Dallas Buyers Club. 

I would have given it Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor as well as Best Director. That said, I'm really happy Jared and Matthew won in those categories because I really love them and wish them the best.  




 It's just that exactly. Hype. 




 It's not as great as all the hype and awards would lead someone who hasn't seen it to believe. Much better movies have won less. 




 Children of Men is a better movie and got no oscars 




 Children of Men is better and won no oscars. 




 It won't 




 Honestly I didn't even know it had music until the final scene. 




 That's still hoping for a lot. I loved Her but hype is a powerful thing. As much as I want Her to win, I wouldn't be surprised if it lost. I hope I'm wrong. 




 See everyone says this and I think it doesn't sound like the compliment people mean it to be. You say it with good intentions, but it's actually a knock against a movie if it's not as good in one format as it is in another format. Anyone who says "see it in theaters" or "see it in 3D" are basically saying that it won't be as good on a small screen or in 2D unintentionally. 




 Yeah Lubezki did and is a fantastic cinematographer 




 That movie was robbed of its cinematography award. 




 AMA for the pizza dude 




 He even gave it to someone else just like the real one would do. 




 So sort of like Ridley Scott with Alien. How he managed to not only create a movie, but an iconic universe as well? 









 We've seen threads before about who we think are great directors, writers, actors, etc., but what do you think *makes* these filmmakers great? What makes a great filmmaker? 









 But how difficult is this to do as someone with little to no audio experience. Just figuring out what I'd need seems like a big challenge. 




 That's fair. I should've said that while on Amazon it says $600, I actually found one on sale somewhere for around $350, which I guess, is still more. 




 Are they bad simply because they *are* actually bad? Or is the Bose actually good but you're saying it's bad because there are better options? 

I just simply don't have the time to learn about audio and have an entire day or more of trial and error figuring out how to make it all work. 

I'm not saying your input is bad, any and all input is greatly appreciated, I'm just trying to figure out if the Bose is a decent sound system, not compared to something I could build better, but as far as packaged home systems go.  




 So we got our tax refund and we want to buy a sound system for our home theater. Right now we're deciding between these two. I was wondering if I could get advice on which is better because I know very little about audio.

 Fall/winter I have this old Plugg jacket from 8th grade. Still fits and looks great. It's olive green and has a nice taper in the sleeves and waist. I've had it for close to 10 years. Very very durable. It's been through a lot. 

In the spring/summer it's black basketball shorts. That's what I wear *all* the time when it's hot. Not really fashionable, I know, but because they are solid black they look decent for these hot summers my city's known for.  




 It's like 6-10 hours depending on traffic and stops 




 Yeah Dallas is kind of far for me to drive unfortunately but it's the closest she'll be to me the entire tour so it's worth it 




 I might end up going alone if a friend can't go. It'd be nice to hang out pre show or maybe, if by some chance, our seats are near each other, during the show. Concerts are always weird by yourself. At least for me they are. Anyway, just curious. 




 I really love Born This Way. It was the first song of hers that I heard and really loved. Before that I had just been a casual fan who listened to her on the radio. I also love Bad Romance, Monster, and my favorite might be Dope. I love how personal and reserved it feels compared to most of her songs. 

It's hard to pick just one from Artpop because that whole album is more my style. 




 Thanks! Another question, how worth it is general admission? I know this is more of a personal preference sort of thing but how much more am I going to get out of the show if I do GA vs regular seating? Is it worth waiting in line all day, to you personally? It's just that I've never done GA before. 

You also said if I showed up later, I'd get the back. How terrible is the back of GA? Last one, is there a chance that if I showed up late for GA that they'd run out of room and I wouldn't get in?

Again sorry for all the questions. You're very helpful! 




 So I have a question, does this mean I'd have to wait there all day to get in? Like, for example, if I get there at 8 am, do I have to wait there in line until like 8 pm or whenever it starts, to get in? Or can I chow up at 8 am, get a ticket, leave, then come back when the show starts? Also, how much are GA tickets?

Sorry for bombarding you with questions, you just seem like you know. Thanks in advance! 




 I cried during the last scene.  




 I can't even comprehend this, it's so great. 




 I think *Gravity* is *way* too high up on this list I think it's the most surprising one. I kind of expected it to be on the list, but definitely not that high up.. I can't believe the movies that it's ranked higher than. Should definitely be in the 200's at most. I know this list is less about "best" and more about "favorite", but even by that standard *Gravity* has to be one of the more overrated ones on this list. 




 Naw the song I'm looking for is far more recent. 




 It was a female singer. Obviously she didn't really say "something", but I can't for the life of me remember what the lyrics are or what song. 

Any ideas? 




 Lights out!

Guerrilla radio! 




 Yeah he's still young and impressionable. I'm sure him seeing all this stuff must really mess him up.  




 I choose a movie based on what my mood is at that time. Like am I in the mood for crime, action, comedy, etc. as well as sub-genre stuff like dark movies, violent, gritty, depressing, fast paced, light-hearted, etc.

A good way to find subgenres is Netflix. You can find a vast list of sub-genres or you can find a movie you've seen that is close to what you want to watch in tone and Netflix will say "This movie is: Violent, dark, etc." and will tell you what tone it is. You can then click on, let's say "dark" if I wanted to watch a dark movie, and Netflix will list all of the movies it has for instant that are categorized as dark.  




 1993 - either Jurassic Park or Schindlers List. Probably Jurassic Park.  









 Like when something happens in a movie that you've been waiting or wanting to happen. Or when a character dies or when something happens in a movie that you just find so satisfying.  




 Its just always fascinated me how a games graphics could be so heavily improved but I don't understand how it's done.  




 It's like Russian roulette for your mouth.  




 The food storm in Kazaam. When Max wishes it will rain junk food and it just French fries, burgers, candy, and pancakes everywhere.  




 I completely agree that sequels work for comic book movies. It makes sense. I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a huge fan of sequels. 

And as for comic book movies taking over original films. I guess I just meant adaptations and remakes in general. As the years go on, the number of original films are getting smaller and smaller. Everything is based on a comic or book or a remake or sequel or reboot. I can't say I blame Hollywood. If I knew a specific thing would sell, I'd make it too. 

And again, adaptations of comic books and remakes and what not wouldn't bother me if they did something interesting with them. But they all feel the same which makes me feel jaded towards them.  




 I dislike the Godfather a great deal, but I recognize its a great film.  




 I can honestly see Shia making a comeback in like 5 or so years. Just imagine it for a second. He makes a huge mistake and decides to roll with it. For the next five years he disappears from the public eye. And when he does appear, everything he says is a quote from someone else. Then after years of being hidden he comes out of nowhere starring in a film with a great director and blows us all away.  




 I'm not really into them honestly. They aren't bad though. I really love the Nolan Batmans though because they didn't *feel* like a comic book movie, if that makes sense. When they first made an impression in like 2008 I liked them but I feel like now there is just such an over saturation of them. Honestly for me, my main problem is the fact that they are sequels and adaptations. It sounds shallow, but I'd much rather see an original film than another Marvel or DC movie. But it wasn't this way like 5 or 6 years ago because there weren't so many. We use to get super hero stuff like every two years or so. Now we get them every year. Sometimes two or more a year. 

I also don't like, and this is more a flaw with Hollywood than super hero films themselves, that producers are just looking for properties and franchises to adapt or remake simply because they know it will sell, thus creating less and less original content. These days, comic book movies are replacing original films. It used to be adaptations were made along side original films. Now it feels they are taking the place of original films. Again though, this is more a problem with Hollywood. 

I'm not totally against super hero stuff as long as they change it up or do something interesting with it. That's why I loved the Nolan Batmans. But now, every Marvel movie looks the same and every DC movie looks the same. They all look and feel the same. That combined with how frequently we see them makes them feel super dull and dry to me. 

Like 10 years ago, I'd be so pumped for the next super hero movie. Now, they just aren't special anymore. At least to me it feels that way.  




 This is actually pretty true! I went through a bunch of guys with their penises all out then they would leave immediately when they saw I was a dude. Then this one dude didn't leave immediately so we started talking and had a really nice conversation. Turned out to be a pretty cool guy.

 And the best thing about Jurassic Park 3.  




 Mayo? 




 I don't think Beyond the Black Rainbow is particularly great, but I do love that movie.  




 This is seriously a fantastic movie! 




 I honestly don't remember anything about this movie but I *do* remember liking it.  




 Wait, Dancer in the Dark is on streaming? I've always wanted to see it.  




 This is sort of why I hope Gravity doesn't win best picture, not that I think it will, but hype is a powerful thing. Especially in an awards show that has slowly become a popularity contest. I think Gravity is really good, but I've always thought that best picture should be reserved for timeless films. Films that are just as great and just as powerful no matter the format, no matter the screen size. I agree that Gravity will lose a lot of its powerfulness with its transition to small screens. The same happened with Avatar.  




 I'm subscribed to a few youtubers who do reviews that I trust. I also look at the discussion threads on /r/movies that they have every week. I find that I trust the opinion of the general public more than a pro reviewer. I don't know why, I just do for some reason.

For the most part though I generally don't look at reviews. If it's something I want to see, then I'll go see it. If it's something I don't really have an interest in seeing, then I'll likely stay away from it for the time being.  




 What if there's no IMAX near OP? And if there is, what if it's not playing? Will he/she have a lesser viewing experience? 




 I'm not really into ghosts or possession movies, but I love creature films with physical creatures or monsters. What are some decent ones besides the classic ones like Black Lagoon, Wolfman, etc.? Like more recent ones?

Edit: When I said classics I should have been more clear. I meant the ones people always say as well like Alien and the Thing. I meant more recent and more obscure creature films.  




 I'm looking at a bunch of steelbooks and about 90% of them are region b, or the UK, or only just Europe. Is there a reason for this? Why doesn't America get them as well? 




 I want to find more rare editions or limited editions of movies, but the thing is, I don't know which movies have other versions or editions. Is there a website that list them or I can use as a resource? 




 I watched Punch Drunk Love, and I was wondering if you guys had any favorite unconventional love stories in movies. It doesn't necessarily have to be a romance movie either.  




 I really *really* love the big forest scenery in movies like The Hunted and even the Twilight movies have nice forest scenes. Are there any movies that take place predominately in the forests of Washington or Canada? Or even Alaska? Or other forests/wilderness like the ones found in north eastern America and Canada? 




 What are your favorite box arts or covers? Whether they be special editions, steelbooks, or just regular covers, which are your favorites? I'm a big fan of the box art for [The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Thin-Line-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBIRA/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv ie=UTF8 qid=1391655340 sr=1-3 keywords=the+thin+red+line) 




 See I disagree with this because everyone has *their own* problems. All of my problems *are* relevant to me. That's what makes the *my* problems. If they were irrelevant to me then they aren't my problems. Everyone's problems, no matter how big or small, are relevant to them. Maybe not to someone else, but to them they are. My complains and problems may be less important than someone else's but that doesn't make them less important to me. Like when I was younger and I would complain about having hard homework and my mother would make a comment about third world children not even having a school. I understand that it's a big problem, but it doesn't make my homework any easier, it just puts things into perspective. 




 I watched a movie called [Three O'Clock High](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094138/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I love love *love* this movie. It's about your average high schooler, Jerry Mitchell, who finds himself challenged to fight the new guy, Buddy Revell.

Buddy is the new guy who, according to rumors, is a psychopath. He doesn't like to be touched. The last guy who touched him had his arm broken. Buddy is your typical bad boy. He wars boots, jeans, black leather jacket, and a white t-shirt. When Jerry Mitchell introduces himself, he puts his foot in his mouth and can tell he's making Buddy angry. In an attempt to fix the situation, Jerry asks if they can start over and gives Buddy a nice friendly pat on the shoulder. Psycho Buddy warns Jerry of what he's done and tells him that they are going to fight in the parking lot at 3 o'clock. Jerry then spends the movie trying to get out of it by any means possible.

This movie is exceptionally well made. The pacing, directing, and camera work are all absolutely fantastic.It's such an easy movie to watch because of how well paced it is. We constantly aware of what time it is and how much time Jerry has left. I cannot stress enough how fantastically well made this movie is. It's so much fun.

The thematic elements we see and hear throughout the film are really well done. For example, Jerry is in Biology and watching the Wonderful World of Insects. We hear the narrator describing the grasshopper who is going about his day and is preyed upon by the large crab scorpion. Another instance in English when we hear about the gladiator battles.

All in all this movie is great. If you're a fan of movies that take place in a day, this is one of the best ones. It's well made with fantastic direction and the pacing is great. It's an immensely fun movie and I highly recommend it.  




 So just yesterday I watched [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=nv_sr_1) which is about a group of people who are all competing for a high ranking job at a top of the line company. They must decide whether to work together or alone in order to figure out the simple yest complicated test they are given that puts them to their limits.

This film is a very tight psychological mystery. It opens with eight applicants who enter a testing room. They are greeted by their test giver who gives them a few simple rules to follow. They are told there is one question and only one answer. However they must figure out what the question is as well as the answer in under 80 minutes.

We spend the movie in an almost real-time fashion watching these people trying to solve this strange mystery. It's hard to describe without spoiling it, and this is not something you want spoiled. The acting is mostly good while occasionally, but rarely, coming off as hammy. The writing is pretty tight while rarely being cheesy. The stand out in this film is the story.

This is a very interesting mystery puzzle of a story. Why are these people here? What's the job? What's the company? Why is the application process like this? What's the question? What's the answer? Over the course of the movie we watch them slowly try to solve these questions. The writers did a great job of creating this quasi-futuristic world and the conflicts it faces. Again, it's hard to talk about without spoiling.

While watching this I got two vibes from it. Cube and Reservoir Dogs. Two very different movies. 

I seriously recommend checking this out. Especially if you love a great mystery. It's on Netflix instant.     




 A few days ago I watched [The Iceman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1491044/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in which Michael Shannon plays notorious mob hitman Richard Kuklinski.

I thought the movie was very interesting. I had never heard about Kuklinski before I saw the movie so it was all new information for me which made it that much better because I didn't know a thing. The writing was pretty good as well as the directing, but what really stands out is the acting. Michael Shannon, as always, is extremely powerful in this role. He is seriously one of the best actors working today. Shannon is joined by Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, and a surprising David Schwimmer. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The stand outs were obviously Shannon and Chris Evans, or at least for me they were. It was nice to see Schwimmer in a *very* different role than normal. However, I kind of chuckled at Ray Liotta. Not because he was bad, Liotta is solid in this. I chuckled because Ray Liotta has to be one of the most typecasted actors today. I'm sure 90 percent of his career is gangster/mob stuff. Not that I'm complaining.

It's easy to overestimate an actors performance, but this movie is great because of Shannon. Without him I think it would have been just good. 

I got a Zodiac vibe from it. Mostly because they are both period piece crime films that take place over a decade. Which brings me to the other thing that stood out to me. The costume and set design. I totally felt that I was there in the 60s and 70s.

All in all I strongly recommend checking this out if you haven't. It's seriously a great film that really shows how powerful Michael Shannon is on screen. His presence is almost God-like in its power. It's on Netflix instant so give it a watch sometime.  




 Why what were you going to say? Please continue to contribute! 




 This is actually *exactly* what made me think of the quote from the movie I'm looking for. When I saw that ad I turned to my cousin and said, "It's just like in that movie when the kid is told to run home and runs to his actual home saying run home, run home." 




 Yes! This is it! For the past few days I've been saying this quote to myself trying to figure out where I heard it and whenever I typed it into google, all I got were home run videos. Thank you so much I can sleep now! 




 So yeah there was this baseball movie where a kid is told to run home so he runs to his house saying "run home run home" 




 Dude again I never said it was a bad post or it should be removed. I like it! No, image macros suck. Mods already said that those are pushing it. It may be half gaming related but that means it's 50% irrelevant as well. My first comment was downvoted because I made an observation. Then my second comment was downvoted because I was simply saying that I did like the post but just thought it'd be better suited somewhere else. I'm not being disrespectful to anyone.  




 I know we're pretty lenient with the rules around here but I'm sure this interferes with rule 1 somehow. I'm not saying this post sucks or it should be removed. I think it's hilarious! But I think it's better suited somewhere else like /r/Funny. It *barely* has anything to do with gaming besides the background and coloring.  




 The comments here suck 




 But don't people only do dangerous stuff for the adrenaline rush and to look cool? Like skydiving or free climbing? 




 I thought that the PS2 one was based on the movie Narc 




 Kind of related question, does anyone know the release date for the second episode of The Walking Dead Season 2? 




 Wow. A post about a movie character made it on the front page of /r/Gaming.  




 Mim looking for movies that are like Children of Men or The Road. Like movies where a character or group of characters have to travel through and survive either a war torn country or post apocalyptic world. Like where it's more about a journey the character(s) have to make through that world in order to get to a destination. 

Can you think of any movies like this? 




 I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great choice.  




 [Smokin' Aces (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

When a Las Vegas  performer decides to testify against the mob, they put a hit on him that brings together all sorts of crazy characters and assassins. This is a very fun action/thriller. 




 It's not the best, but I really *really* love the opening scene of [Narc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xfrmlcIQf4) 




 But I feel like this one is going for a comic book feel way more than Spiderman 3. So I think this one can get away with it.  




 This was my huge beef with GTA V. I fell about 50 feet and only lost about half health. I did a front flip down some stairs and died instantly. 




 Like for example, the hero is driving a car and the bad guy shoots at him and we, the viewer, see bullet holes and shattered glass. Do they put charges in the glass, or what?

I know when they do squibs, or blood hits, the actor wears an explosive blood pack. And wall hits are just pockets in the wall with tiny explosives. But how do they do glass? 




 And that you have to be an experienced professional and not just some dude. Thought I could just apply to be a gaffer but it looks like their looking for bigger pros.  




 Yeah it have a lot of respect for Heder. It must be so hard to be an actor and Mormon. Having to turn down roles. I respect that he sticks to his morals. There are quite a few famous actors who use to be Mormon but stopped practicing in favor of roles.  




 Not really any movie in particular, but I love on set b-role footage. I also really love special feature that look at how a movie's special effects were done. And I prefer these extras to be lengthy and not just a short 5 minute montage or compilation. Like the in depth on set footage or SFX stuff.

Spider Man 2 had literally hours of behind the scenes stuff.  




 I'm don't read comics but I had it spoiled for me when I looked at its IMDB. 




 I don't mind Bruno Mars and I think he's talented, but man I was so bummed when I realized it was Bruno with special guest Red Hot Chili Peppers and not the other way around. 




 Wait, so Bruno Mars is the star and The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the special guest?! Screw that 




 Can I get a gif of the "jazz hands" from the two dudes from the Seahawks and Broncos? Anyone know what I'm talking about? 




 Eli looked like Scar up in the box watching his brother Mufasa. 




 This is sad. It's a cold reminder that actors are still just people and they won't be around forever. It's always a weird feeling when you realize that you won't see someone again. It's always shocking and never easy to believe when someone dies. He was easily one of the greatest actors. He won't be forgotten. 




 Spy films. We really only see James Bond and we only get that like once every five years or more. 

Also noir. Like good classic style noir. Nicolas Winding refn is bringing it back in a way, but there is still a lack of it.

Lastly, hard, cerebral sci-fi. Today so many sci-fi movies are all about cgi, huge explosions, and lots of action. We don't really see sci-fi that focuses more on world building and story. Her was a great step towards getting back to hard sci-fi, but we need more of it. 




 I really liked how classic rock was used in a Knight's Tale. It contrasted with the times, yet it worked so well.

Another recent use I really loved was the use of The National's song About Today at the end of Warrior. I won't go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil this fantastic movie. But it perfectly captured that moment and broken relationship between two brothers and their father. 




 But that's sort of what I'm getting at. Movies *are* a visual media but I don't think that should mean visuals should come first. I'm not saying that Gravity's visuals come first, but it sure appears that way when the visuals drown out the story. Story is important. Especially if we're talking Best Picture. It's perfectly okay for a story to be simple. But there's a difference between simple and shallow. Children of Men wasn't even nominated in any acting categories, best picture or director. I may be in the minority here, but I believe Children of Men is a league above Gravity. Best picture should be a well rounded film, which I honestly don't think Gravity is. But again that said, I still think Gravity is a technological achievement in film.

 I never criticized Gravity's story. I never said it was bad, I just simply said it was similar to Avatar and American Hustle in that the story wasn't the best part.  The thing about Gravity is that it's okay to have a simple story. But it felt like the story wasn't important. You could tell that the tech was more important. When you have complex and bombastic tech and visuals, it overshadows the simple story. The story wasn't just simple, it was kind of flat. A story can be simple, but I feel it needs depth. Great stories are not determined by how complex or simple they are, but how much depth they have.  




 So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking. I found Gravity to be one of the most technically impressive movies I've ever seen and it is an accomplishment. But I can't help but feel that it's a little over-hyped.

I find myself reminded of Avatar. Avatar is a technically impressive film of the same caliber as Gravity, I feel. Yet Avatar's plot was "meh". I feel the same about Gravity. Again, it's a technically remarkable film, but I feel that that's really all it has going for it. The acting is good and the plot is also kind of "meh".

Today, Avatar is a movie we don't think about to often, and while impressive on a big screen, it loses a lot of that impressiveness on a small, home tv. Going back to the awards poster for Gravity, one of the quotes says, "A groundbreaking film that must be seen in Imax 3D." Which is exactly like Avater. I worry that Gravity will not be as impressive on smaller screens resulting in a less powerful film because Gravity does rely a lot on its technical aspects.

I'm also reminded of American Hustle in a way. The general consensus here is that American Hustle has great acting but a "meh" plot, and a film shouldn't be considered great based on just one aspect of it. I think the same could be said for Gravity. The strongest, and really the only thing it has going for it, is its technical achievements. Now, I do realize that Gravity and American Hustle are two different beasts. And I do want to say that I'm not hating on Gravity because I think it's a really good film that has made incredible leaps in its technology. These are just observations I've made.

Edit: Just wanted to point out that Children of Men wasn't even nominated for any acting categories, best picture or director.  




 I have to say Napoleon Dynamite. I think it's so different from any other comedy. I love it's weird dry sense of humor. It's easily one of the movies I quote the most.

 Because /r/gaming is one of the worst subreddits.  




 I'm Mormon and I'm late to reply, but I can decide that it's just a game. I play M rated games and watch R rated movies all the time, even though we're encouraged not to. The way I see it, it's not influencing me. I'm able to separate my life from a video game or movie. In the case of GTA V, my character murders, breaks the law, drinks, goes to the strip club, etc. This is all happening in the game, sure I'm making him do it, but it's just a game. I'm not doing these things in real life so why should it matter. Same with R rated movies. I'm just a spectator, not a participant. 




 Dude...Kill List is in no way a comedy. Probably one of the darkest movies I've seen. I didn't feel good afterwords. Loved it though.  




 /r/movieclub does this every week. The community chooses based on upvotes then they watch and discuss. I'm not against having it here, but just FYI incase there are people who want to do this but we end up not doing it here.
