 I need more friends on MFP. Just added you. :) I'm Anthliel if someone else wants to add me.  




 I just added you! I don't know how friends work on MFP but if you can se my diary then it probably won't make much sense to you since english is not my first language and I tend to log most of my food in swedish. But calories are the same in every language. :) I'm going to try to log my food in english when possible.  




 This is me! I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old, just changed career (used to be at teacher actually) and trying to find out who I am. It's so inspiring to read about people like me who have made the change.

I started logging yesterday and today I have already prepared lunch and logged it (it's morning now where I am). If you wan't to add me on MFP my username is Anthliel. :) 




 It's seems like I'm writing this to everyone but this is just what I needed today. I used to see a psychologist last year and she told me exactly this. I need to start to forgive myself and recognize that I'm only human. It's hard but I think I can do it. Thank you!   




 And there really is no end. This is a life long journey and I need to accept that. There is a reason that I have always gained back everything I have lost. The end is just the beginning.
