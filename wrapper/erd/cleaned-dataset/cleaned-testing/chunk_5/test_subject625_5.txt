 "Newest big patch that was supposed to FIX the game? Yeah, all our saves are gone. Thanks."

That's how I read that, you guys are so sassy with your Master Race Rage haha 




 "I keep losing track of my pockets. What do all that I own? Can somebody help me find myself???"

I'm a mess when I trip. 




 I thought I might've been the only one experiencing the volume issue, thanks a ton! 









 Oh definitely aha It's funny because it can be a little boring to watch sober, but overly intense to watch tripping. He should save it for next time then if he's iffy about it haha 




 Well yeah haha But I'm saying, I can't really tell what's too loud you know? It's hard to describe. I can recognize volume differences but I don't know when the volume is too high 




 Oh, and Wolf Of Wallstreet was actually pretty trippy. Lots of metaphors, motifs, interesting things you can catch when you're tripping. 




 Haha I feel you dude. I'll have everything planned out and then I'll just be like "Wait, this is all so bland." It's like, the things you think are gonna be cool when you trip aren't as much so when you're actually in the headspace. 




 Lots of people will tell you "Just go outside, it's way better". While being outside is incredibly enjoyable, sometimes people's interests lie elsewhere (Like myself) and that's okay. Do what you wanna do.

I'd definitely recommend Enter The Void: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKRxDP--e-Y

It's completely first person, which makes it very cool to watch when tripping. You notice his eyes blink, you hear his thoughts, his voice is even muffled as it would be when you hear your own voice. It's cool. He's a trip junkie and he takes DMT, then he dies and you journey through the after life and observe the past and future of the lives you left behind. I think everyone should see this at least once during a trip.

A chiller movie I'd recommend would be Disney's Fantasia. Definitely a beautiful thing to see during a peak.

As far as games, I find that roaming around in GTA can be funny and just odd at times. Hotline Miami is a very colorful game, really tailored for tripping. Another favorite would be Destiny. Also very colorful aha I'd suggest more based on your tastes if you'd like, I'm just into anything pretty much. 




 At times, usually during my peak, I'll notice that increases and decreases in volume are kind of weird. It's like, I notice the volume going up and down but I can't tell what's too loud or too quiet. Does that make sense? Anyone else get this? 




 I just realized that's The Son running toward Tony. 




 Call it whatever you want, dude. We all know what you're taking.

GRATEFUL DEAD. 




 So I started out with the intro, it was definitely dark for me. Darker than it was playing sober. I felt like I was experiencing it how the developers intended. The intended emotional reactions from the scenes, I felt tenfold. The first thing I noticed was that I completely forgot to play. At the same time, it was almost second nature to me. Hard to explain. The Xbox controller was hard to handle and my hands were sweating. Somehow I managed to do relatively well. Oh, when I did the Apocalypse level... That was really something. It felt new again. I remember when I first played the level and I was like "What's happening? Why are things blowing up?" This time, I had those same thoughts. Lots of confusion. Plus, I really didn't want to kill anyone... Which was strange. When I got to the first "Boss" (Mark) the growl terrified me. Every boss after that was a bit frightening as well, but in a good way. Very intense aha 




 There's been a whole new meaning to "Gotta get a grip" for me... 




 Still waiting on that story man!

And you definitely should, I really spoke to me during the trip. I highly recommend giving it a trippy listen. His unique beats and sounds and mix of styles just really flows well. It keeps you interested and always changes up in the most pleasant ways. Plus when he gets really serious or emotional or presents questions or ideas to the listener it really gives you something to think about. Something valuable in my opinion. It was great on my headphones though ;D 




 I usually get everything cleaned, take a shower, shave (Love having the smooth face when I trip), and eat a meal roughly an hour before I take the tabs. With the tabs in my mouth, I lay in my bed and either play a simple game that's not too intense or try to watch something animated on YouTube or Netflix. Then I let the magic happen (; 




 Yeah I was loving the window view but I just felt caged and really hot, kinda claustrophobic aha Everything worked out though 




 You mean at the place with the drinking?

I dunno, I don't like drinking and I've had a lot of issues in my family dealing with it. Just a lot of bad memories and things like that. Plus, I have this hatred for it really. All I see in my mind is a bunch of apes and aggression fuel. Not something I was interested in being around. Plus, the guy who lived there is really paranoid and it was making me paranoid. Not to the point where I'd freak out, but just an annoyance really.
