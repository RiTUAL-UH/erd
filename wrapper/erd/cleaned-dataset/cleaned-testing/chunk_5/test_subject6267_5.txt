 Yep, pretty much everything here is Japanese but with simplified Chinese eg. Kiss Me is written as  (pronounced tchi-shhhh-may) however the MG masks are Chinese and they work really nice for me, but that Neutrogena cleanser is super drying, as with a lot of Chinese cleansers (Pond's too OMG my face) probably due to the high pH. 




 Oh wow, the C20 seems worth a shot then, I may as well apply it like lotion 




 So due to RRS's revamp and subsequent sale, I'm thinking of purchasing either the OST C20 or the It's Skin Power 10 VC, although I am leaning towards the C20 cause I'm using a SAP from Instanaturals and don't seem to be seeing any results.

It does seem that most people find C20 to oxidise quite fast so perhaps maybe I could use it on my back to treat acne scarring?

Has anyone else tried using Vitamin C serums on their body and how were the results? 




 Its so much easier to use the search function as well, it took me ages to figure out how to use it before! 









 I am soon moving to study abroad for a while so I need to get rid of this stuff. I will add more things to this list as I pack over time so please do check it out!

 Sweet AND savoury pancakes!! 




 It seems that Innisfree's versions tends to run 1 shade lighter than everyone else for some reason and so it probably wouldn't match. 




 Hi, I'm in the UK and my flair thread is [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/mueflair/comments/3aoh31/test_subject6267_flair_thread/) 









 I was the one who posted, sorry! 




 I second the Mizon Acence Pink Out, it really sucks out all the nasty pus inside the spot but don't keep reapplying consecutively. I definitely prefer this to Mario Badescu's Spot Solution, which I found to be so drying- it literally left dark spots of damaged skin after. 




 Oh I absolutely love her character! She's pretty much the absolute epitome of asian parenting hahaha, especially when she butters up to Joon Mo and Ye Jin 




 Yeah of course, take your time! I'll PM you the total price and my details. 




 That's great, I'll PM you my PayPal details and will ship them Monday morning! 




 Yes, of course. Just to let you know, I have underestimated the shipping, 1st Class recorded is actually 4.40 and 2nd class is 3.90 as per Royal Mail's website:http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/Royal-Mail-UK-and-international-parcel-and-letter-prices-30-March-2015.pdf

Is this okay for you? 




 Sure, just to confirm, are you in the UK?

 Oh my goodness, I have been waiting for this for ages! I'm sitting on another AB order and this is exactly what I need to make a final decision! 




 I've had some of Mario Badescu's stuff which an online SA recommended after I described my skin type. I have the Cucumber Cleansing Toner: it did absolutely nothing for me, I now use it on my back before applying my Benzoyl Peroxide just to use it up. The Glycolic toner is quite good, especially if you're new to AHA's as its fairly mild, although I'm not quite sure what concentration it is.

I would say Fig   Yarrow have a similar philosophy and products to Aesop; I've tried their coffee body scrub before which was nice, but I felt like I could make it myself with used coffee grounds.  




 Yeah I've heard that its a great dupe for the Hourglass Ambient Light Pallette 




 I haven't eaten red meat for the past 4-5 months but once I got here like 2 days ago, I have been chomping food down like mad.

The lamb was so crisp like lamb chua'er and so tender, well marinated and the soup was very light with a mix of silken and frozen tofu to give it more texture. Could definitely taste all spice, cumin and cinnamon in the lamb. I also spooned some of the stew with my rice to mix and it was really amazing.

Best part is, that dish cost like 40RMB, which is like 4!!
