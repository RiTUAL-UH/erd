 Thank you. 




 That is your opinion.  




 If it can't be patented even better. I will just raise awereness for this mrsa treatment idea. I do believe I am the first person to use a hydroponic grow bulb to produced the 400nm light necessary to treat my reoccurring mrsa infections. Google hydroponic bulb mrsa 




 Because nobody has ever used a hydroponic grow bulb to produce this 400nm light. If it can't be patented even better. I will then just raise awereness for this MRSA treatment method.
  




 Maybe. Could turn into an interesting  court case. 




 They don't. Don't even know the people who run this website.  




 Someone has some common sense. 




 This is why I am posting information. Would like the scientific community to research my mrsa combination treatment. 




 This combination therapy combines known infection methods to produce an effective respose to my mrsa infections Also, I am the first person to use a blue spectrum hydrolux  hydroponic weed grow bulb to produce this 400nm light. This bulb is new technology.  Google hydroponic grow bulb mrsa.

 I don't think this is a guaranteed to work. Would like idea to be tested and hopefully replicated in a lab. Then idea could be submitted for peer review. 




 I hope so. I am a nerd not a lawyer. 




 No alcohol makes mrsa worse. Will provide link in a min. 




 True. If my idea works may be an interesting court case.

 Give me a minute. I will provide links. Also my friend is a retired microbiologist. I have a youtube video where he comments on my mrsa treatment idea 




 Almost lost my leg. When I was in the hospital they sent me a chaplain because they where not sure if I was going to make it. Last year 700,000 people died worldwide from this flesh-eating eating disease. By 2030, it may be as high as 10 million. 




 Give me a min and I will give you links. My comments are going crazy. 




 Google 400nm light infections. 
 




 Understand how to read peer review medicial papers even though I am not a doctor. Plus light and radar are basically the same thing just a different spectrum. I am a nerd. 




 It is already too late. My youtube video's have been viewed in over 60 countries and shared in over a dozen websites.My videos have been even download and shared from Russian and Chinese websites. 




 You get the idea buddy. I already have over 2500 views on my youtube channel and idea has been shared on over a dozen website. 




 Because I don't have the 10- 100 k to the 
get the medicial patent.  




 Look at the peer review papers on 400nm blue light then get back with me. 




  Jonas Salk gave away his polio vaccine patent-free. 




 Because I am not a doctor.I worked on the AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile radar in the navy so I understand how this technology works. 




 It is not a cure but a treatment for my reoccurring mrsa infections. 




 This is not my website. The MRSA foundation just shared one of my youtube videos. Look at the peer review research of 400nm blue light. My idea was to get this 400nm blue light from a hydroponic grow bulb. Hope this helps. 




 Then go patent it buddy. 




 Feel free. Just realize I will be your companies worst PR nightmare. 




 That's the rebel spirit. I guess the system failed to teach you "learned helplessness". 




 The hospital has treated over a dozen of my mrsa infections with antibotics. After I came up with idea, I have treated three MRSA infections without antibotics. I almost died from this flesh eating disease. I agree it is not science until postive results are replicated in many different people.
Would like scientific community too research idea further. 




 I hope they can figure out what the problem was. All new technology has problems.

This will answer your questions. 




 This animation will answer your questions.

 Thank you for posting. Made my day.  
























 Good to see an adult with passion. 




 He is CEO of three different companies : space x, solar city, and telsa. When does he sleep. 




 Have you ever see the falcon 9 heavy animation video. 




 Bringing back a stage of rocket from the edge of space will be a little harder. You have to crawl before you walk. 




 It will all be shot in HD video. Cool indeed. 




 I bet the amount of data that this rockets computers have to compensate for is impressive.
