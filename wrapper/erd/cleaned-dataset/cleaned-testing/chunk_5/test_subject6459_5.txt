 Hiding in tunnels and telling civilians to disregard evacuation orders is facing the enemy directly? Oh Lord.  




 Find me another that says a massive amount of people who happens to be your anscestors witnessed a miraculous event. 




 Yeah, by a group of people we would call Orthodox Jews.

Yes, because no other Judaism existed. Regardless, your claim about Hebrew being a dead language, only used by the clergy, is incorrect. Again, we don't have to talk about past interpretations; look at the verse in Hebrew now.

 A copy of a copy can have no greater than 100% fidelity, and mistakes aggregate and are rare to correct.

Have you looked at the process of copying the Torah? It is extremely accurate.

Still interpretation.

Yes, but other interpretations is not "just as likely to be correct" as mine, because of these rules.

If that hebrew is the same as the hebrew spoken now, why would we have needed interpretation of it 2000 years ago?

Of course it does. What does it mean to not cook a kid in it's mother's milk, and why is it repeated three times in different sections? What does it mean, slaughter an animal as I have instructed you?

But a cheeseburger can be made without even cooking the cheese with the burger, so it clearly isn't prohibited by the Torah itself.

It depends. How do you define cooking?

You don't worship a different God. You don't have a moral standard that allows the killing of innocents. You believe in charity and helping you fellow man. You believe in obeying the laws of the society in which you live. You believe courts are a valid way of resolving disputes. There are religions that disagree on each of these values.

Many Christian sects also agree on all of these, and they are separate. That's what I was pointing to.

Now onto your supposed list of agreement.

All divisions of Jewish faith believes that the messiah has not come.

Not true, and hasn't been in the past. Of course, some would not call messianic chabad Jewish...

They believe that the sabbath should be kept holy, and is on the seventh day of the seven day week: Saturday. 

Reform believes you don't have to, and even celebrated it on Sunday in the 1800's!

There are no differences I am away of between newer Jewish practices and Orthodox practices that are bigger than these differences between Judaism and Christianity:

Yes, but I'm not saying that. Judaism is very much different than Christianity. But some of the major differences between Christian sects are much smaller than between the major Jewish denominations. 




 It's not just that it happened to many people, it's that it happened to many people who happen to be our ancestors.  




 Hebrew was a dead language for many centuries, spoken only by 
clergy

Not true, it was used by everyone for prayer and study, and was also used as a base for derivative languages. It was never dead, unlike Latin. And since it has recently been revived with mostly the same base, it's pretty easy to get a correct translation. I can go over the verse in depth if you want.

As for cheeseburgers: that's your interpretation, don't cook the two together.

No, that is not my interpretation. That is the interpretation of the mishna, which is the recording of rabbi's statements from 100 BCE to 100 CE. This is the only interpretation Judaism has had for at least 2000 years, more if the Pharisitic claims about the Oral Law are accurate, as Orthodoxy holds.

There are other interpretations of what "unclean" means with regards to pork.

Nope, it's pretty concrete. It says don't eat it.

It's all interpretation

But there are rules and bases for the interpretation. 

and these differences are relatively minor in practice compared to other religious differences.

Not true. There are significant practical issues in eating in a non-kosher home, for example. In fact, there are many more practical issues with different interpretations than many Christian sect splits.
 




 Is it no drinking and no eating? 




 It's a moral tale, not a history. 




 No, it is clear it is not about the dead, because then "for the dead" would be written at the end of the verse, not in the middle. 

And if we consider the origin of this command, it serves as a way to distinguish ourselves from Canaanites.

The whole point is that Orthodoxy's view of the laws are they are in effect forever, no matter what the origin is.

Where is it written that a new may not eat a cheeseburger?

"Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk" is interpreted as "do not cook meat and milk together." 




 Leviticus 19:28 




 Yes and no. Just don't use either when you are referring to God, and no one will have a problem. 




 Why a fast if it's a celebration? 




 Writing Jehovah's Witnesses is fine, just don't actually use that name for God. 




 Probably about 50% of Jewish male names have God's name in one way or another. The rest are historical. 




 *shrug* Christianity doesn't make any sense to me either. It's not more well known because there there is no one proselytizing to Christians, and most Christians don't seek out opposing arguments. 




 That's great! Maybe talk to the theology professor beforehand about your concerns? If they're Jewish, they'll probably understand where you're coming from.

Also, if you're interested, join some of the nerdy clubs on campus. They usually have less of the drinking/banging than the rest.

Have you figured out what to do when people try to convert you? 




 For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given

This part is past tense, not present tense. Why exactly is an issue of context, but right off the bat what you have is incorrect. Also note that they capitalized child and son to make them seem divine, but there is no such indication in the Hebrew.

and authority/power has been on his shoulders

Government here makes no sense. Settled is an inserted word; the only verb in this phrase is "to be." This is also past tense, not future.

And he has been named

Again, past tense.

Now we come to the names. Hebrew does not have a present tense "is" verb, so this can be taken as a list or "___ is ____". Let's take it word by word.



This is not wonderful, but wonder. It could be an adjective, but properly translated as wonderous.



This can either the verb or the noun: counselor or counseled/determined.

 

there is no "the" here; mighty God is the right translation. Certain phrasing in English will need the for proper grammar, but not the list form.



Again, not "the." Eternal Father.

-

Either:

* "prince of peace," a quality inherent in the prince;
* or "peaceable prince," a quality describing how he acts
* or "prince that makes peace," describing his actions.

I think I've demonstrated enough that your translation is inaccurate. How best to interpret it is up to debate. 

One final point: Just because the persons name has a quality of God does not mean that he is called God. My name has God in it, but I am not claiming divinity.

P.S. Looking at the Chabad/Rashi, he translates it as the name being -, while the rest is describing God. Also perfectly legitimate. And it makes sense that this is describing Hizkiyahu, because they were contemporaries and this does not seem to be a section about the Messianic age. 




 It doesn't. the translation Christian Bibles use are faulty. 




 Just because something is recorded doesn't mean it was the right thing to do. 




 Not exactly. It has a rotating board of rabbis, but it's something different than a sanhedrin, though they do make halachic rulings. 




 One last point. It's easy. Reporters no longer go into Syria, but they can easily talk about Syria from within Israel. 




 If you get me up to 80%+ and you're on the other side of the stage? You bet your ass I'm going to start spamming it. That's your fault I'm in such a good position, and it does take some skill to land it properly. 




 Just write God. That works best. 




 Bigotry of low expectations, right here folks. 




 8:28-29 says that there was a battle against the king of aram. Do you think this occurred?  




 Eh, there is a point for reform Judaism, but not so much conservative  




 [That's partialism, Patrick!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw) 




 If what they say is right, then the stele is saying that their god is better because over time, during the reign of the king who worshiped that god, they prevailed over the objections of those other kings (and their gods), in taking all the land that they wanted to, from them.

Well, yes. It was written by Aram, after the battle with the kings of Israel in Judah. The same battle where the new Israelite King, according to the Bible, slew the two other kings. The king of Aram claims that he killed those kings, in contradiction to the biblical narrative. 

What battle? There is no such battle.

Read II Kings chapters 8-11 again. What do you mean, no battle?

They created a new history of Israel to fit how they interpret the inscription, ignoring what the Bible actually says.

Can you describe what history you're talking about? All I'm doing is quoting the bible. The researchers just matched up the half names on the steele to the names in Kings, not made up another history. What does the Bible "actually say"?

P.S. The various other claims of  means don't dispute the spelling, but the pronunciation. Like the Wikipedia article says, those claims are pretty weak. 




 Proponents of what interpretation? Who rewrote what? This is in the Bible that was canonized before Christianity even existed. What is your alternative?

And yes, Kings and the steele are definitely describing the same battle and outcome, but with two different claims of what happened. That is how history was written in those days -- each side claimed it won (hell, it still happens). 




 [Not quite.](http://www.zionism-israel.com/ezine/Dscn5049.jpg) 




 That says nothing about joining forces against Judah. Even so, that is a prophecy of what will happen. To look at the actual events, read II Kings. 




 Of course it does. Read your Bible - start with II kings 8:16. You will find a separate narrative about the same events. 




 Apologize to the actual person, if you can. He'll appreciate it even if he never responds. 




 The "House of David" on the tel dan steele is referring to the King of Judah, not the king of Israel.
 

 




 Tell that to the Palestinians, who claim that no Jewish temple ever stood there. 




 I'm getting annoyed at my phone (Droid Razr HD) recently at a couple of things. It's getting hot when I'm not using it and the mobile data in on (just sitting in my pocket), using up a lot of battery power. It is also running really slowly, especially when switching between apps. So I have a couple of questions:

1. Is there any way to view and cancel background programs from running?
2. What might be the cause of using so much power when I'm not using my phone?
3. Is there any way to cancel individual app permissions?

If any of this requires me to root my phone, I would appreciate step by step instructions. Thank you! 




 He didn't fulfill the most important ones, namely bringing all the Jews back to Israel and ushering in a golden age for humanity. Which ones did he fulfill, do you think? 




 No, the OT says that Jesus rises from the dead doesn't make him a prophet or in the right. He's not the messiah for different, reasons, namely that he didn't fulfill those prophecies.

I don't come at Christianity with a presumption of Judaism, I come at it with the presumption of atheism

Wonderful, but Christianity itself bases its claims upon Judaism being correct. To be Christian means to accept the OT. 









 The NT definitely punishes thought crimes,

Alright, just please make the distinction between the NT and the OT then. 




  The law says "Don't be gay"

No, it says: "Men, don't have sex with men." Homosexuality wasn't even a concept at that point. Nowhere, outside of jealousy, does the Torah ever condemn thoughts. 




 You said the basis of your faith is that Jesus rose from the dead. But the OT, which you claim is authoritative, definitively says that this doesn't make a difference. How can you reconcile the two? 




 Next up, they'll have to ban premarital sex because it will lead to more mixed dancing, which "desecrates one of the fundamental principles of Judaism!" 




 I don't feel like a male thats effeminate, i feel like a woman

What do you mean if this doesn't include body dysphoria? 




 According to Wikipedia, Socrates was born in 470 BCE and Aristotle was born in 384. 




 Aristotle is typically put as one of the Fathers of Greek ~~philosophy~~ science. He lived in the 4th century BCE, a little after Malachi. 




 Why are you not comfortable identifying as male and just acting in different ways? 




 The fact that the Torah was revealed to all of Israel at once. 




 In Israel just a shroud, outside of Israel a box. 




 A human claiming "I am God" is certainly something different -- and rising from the dead doesn't prove it one way or another. 




 I don't need one. The Torah tells us not to listen to prophets who teach a contradictory message, no matter what miracles they perform. 




 The Romans, in order to insult the Jews more! 




 And if Jesus rose from the dead, it still doesn't prove anything. 




 National Revelation. 




 No it isn't! 




 Darkness is chosech, previously in the verse. Darkness is contrasted to light, and evil is contrasted to peace/wholeness. Where you get sin from, I have no idea. 




 A good discussion is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi) 




 This will be incredible. But why for only those who purchase both...? 




 Ok, Huge Pizza Hog, I think it's time for you to begin. 




 SPECIAL SMASH IS BAAAACK!! 




 8 player smash confirmed!!! 




 But I thought that it was the father speaking that line, since Jesus hadn't previously revealed himself at all?

And anyone can forgive sins; someone comes to apologize to you for something they did to harm you and you forgive them. Poof. Bye sins! You have to do the same thing with God.

You still haven't answered me about Isaiah 43. You ready to debate that?

 




 I would assume you think so, that's what your argument it based on, inst it?
 




 You heard (read?) me. By the your circular logic that is true, but if Jesus didn't save anybody he can't be God, can he?
 




 In them two verses God is saying that there is no saviour beside himself, and verses including Acts 4:12, Luke 2:11, John 4:42 , etc declare that only Christ Jesus is the saviour of the world. Thus Jesus is God.

Or maybe those quotes are just...wrong?

Also, Isaiah 53 is definitely not about the Messiah, and certainly not about Jesus. ready to debate that? 




 Evil is the best translation, as in genesis 3.

 750,000 Palestinians were exiled

True.

through the use of terror attacks such as the Deir Yassin massacre

Not true. Deir Yassin is so infamous precisely because it only happened once, and not by the Haganah/IDF.

the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages

Never seen a good citation for this. Dozens? Probably, mostly along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road because they were being used as shelters for the attackers. Lod is another example. But most of the villages were in the Galil, and many were untouched or the inhabitants fled in advance.

 Palestinians were bound to retaliate in the following years.

800,000 Jews were exiled from Arab countries, and the inhabitants of the Old City, kfar etzion, and other areas had to evacuate, were expelled, or were massacred. Did they not have the right to retaliate?

 




 Fedayeen, I apologize. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967), if you don't already know.

Also, the PLO itself was founded in 1964, but the groups that make it up (Fatah, etc.) existed before. Fatah, for example, was established in 1959. Many of the attacks didn't come from the PLO of today, but were carried out an sponsored by people who did form the group. ([See here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen)) 




 I see a random list, of which at least 3 at first glance *were* during a war. You still haven't addressed the fact that one list starts at 48 and the other at 68. Look up the ~~mujadeen~~ fedayeen. 




 Just want to point out that the actual source is Aramaic, where it means "He created as he spoke." 




 Never made the news? There were at least three articles about it on *this* subreddit alone. And no, it doesn't provide any context whatsoever. Terrorism is never justifiable.  




 Why the hell are you starting at 1968 for the PLO? The groups that make it up go all the way back to Israel's founding. And the list doesn't even distinguish between military and civilian casualties. If you're trying to make a point, at least give correct information. 




 Then what are you saying? I have no idea what the attack and the connection is between the attack and freedom of movement. 




 Yes, a Hamas operative who has been in jail twice was traumatized by a traffic accident where the perpetrator turned himself in. That's why he killed a baby. 




 If the opponent is dodging a lt, short jump and a turning back slash is extremely effective. 




 The title is from the article. And I wouldn't be surprised if "settlers" is interpreted a bit too loosely; after all, Jews are classified as "members of an enemy state." 

 




 Yes. Are you saying that the fact Palestinians don't have freedom of movement justifies terrorist attacks? 




 What does that have anything to do with this attack?  




 I guess that's news to the Hamas driver who was travelling on the highway that goes straight through Jerusalem that serves both Israeli's and Palestinians. I guess it's also news to Palestinians in East Jerusalem that travel on this same light rail all the time between East and West Jerusalem.

**There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.**

 Anyhow, more to your point the fact that Israelis can easily waltz across the border and not vice versa is kind of the problem.

The fact that Palestinians and Jews can travel freely in Jerusalem is a problem? 




 Not true. 




 The terror attack was literally [right at the border](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail#mediaviewer/File:Jerusalemlightrailmap.png) between East and West Jerusalem, right on a highway, a couple of minutes walk from Palestinian neighborhoods. There could have easily been residents of West Jerusalem, tourists, students from Hebrew University, or Palestinians at the station. Are you condemning these people for simply *standing at train station?* 




 Are you really asking why people live in certain places? And did you really just call all of Israel a "Jewish settlement?" 




 Epi-genetic, based on temperatures after the eggs are laid. You can read more in [this explanation](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-temperature-sex-determination-reptiles/) I found. 




 If you trust them, I'm sure you'll be able to find the original sources, right? 




 1. A video they don't link or name, and a statement by the obviously not biased Al-aqsa waqf.
2. Full of outright lies, myths, and STILL doesn't contain any information that anyone wants to destroy Al-Aqsa. 
3. Why does that have anything to do with Jews? 




 Radio? Everything I've seen just says that they praise the attack, but don't take credit. 




 The infant has died while at the hospital. 




 The baby has died, no news on the 8 others injured. 









 The part about uncomfortable/not confident people taking up less space is definitely true, as is the converse. 




 Same as kashrut. These laws are called "chukim" - there are no real explanations. 




 Are the ones is Gush Etzion settlers? Those who returned to their land after their parents were kicked out and massacred?  




 But if you know of them, you can much better understand what they are talking about. Take Isaiah, for example. Lots of Christians misinterpret the book because they have no idea in what time or for whom it was written. But if you do know, and read it in the original language, nearly all your points are moot. 




 And this is why you read it in the original language with knowledge of the authors. 









 It's a metaphor. Since angels don't have free will, everything they do is God's will. 




 The snake is Genesis 3 is just a snake, not Satan. 




 All is under God. Anything else is not monotheism. Is polytheism easier? Absolutely. But that is not what Judaism is. 




 Opposite. God created everything, including evil. The person talking to you about translation is completely wrong. 




 There have been two ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2chmoo/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/)) recent threads about this recently. The second had the same discussion about moral evil happening now; my rebuttal is in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi).

Pretty much all I have to say is there, if you want more details/explanation you can just reply to my comment here. 




 It's amazing how Christians don't seem to know their scripture. 

Chapter 29:

24 they and indeed all the nations will wonder, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? What caused this great display of anger? 25 They will conclude, It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 26 They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them; 27 so the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land, bringing on it every curse written in this book. 28 The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is now the case.

Essentially what Christians have been saying for a long time, including you above.

When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, 2 and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you. 4 Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world,[a] from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. 5 The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.

**God will not abandon his people.** 




 I have heard that it is ok as long as no money is exchanged, barring ma'arit ayin. 




 Side note: where is the long list of prophecies that were actually fulfilled?

I have never seen an accurate one, probably because very little was actually fulfilled.

once to fulfil the law and once to permanently establish his kingdom.

Why two comings? Why should I believe it? Where in the OT is it said?

We want our spouses to make an informed decision and choose to marry us freely. God wants the same thing - he wants us to choose him freely. 

But the Jews are already married to God! What exactly are we choosing again?

He doesn't establish his kingdom permanently yet (the second coming described by all those prophecies in the list) because he wants to give as many people as possible the chance to make the right choice - but in a way that doesn't force it down their throats.

Then why will Jesus ever come back? Isn't it better to continue giving people the choice? If the second coming will remove the choice, then why have it? Won't it make perfection...less perfect?

And you still haven't established why the prophecies should be fulfilled in the second coming. The messiah isn't the messiah unless he fulfills the prophecies. Doing a vague fulfilling the law thing is not what the messiah is supposed to do.

The first of the non-second coming prophecies in the list:

These are refutations of christian theology, not prophecies.

 Yes, Jesus fulfilled the law

But this doesn't mean anything. The law cannot be "fulfilled." It is something to do in perpetuity, not something to be done once.

but he also said he didn't come to abolish it. He didn't tell anyone they should stop following the law. 

But Paul did. And Christianity has followed his teachings.

He just fulfilled its requirements for all mankind

Again, no such thing. Second, the law never applied to everyone, just to the Children of Israel. 

 It is impossible for humans to keep the law and therefore everyone is judged a sinner and therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law because perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin.

Woah woah woah. None of these statements follow. Let's go through them one by one.

It is impossible for humans to keep the law

Yes, it is impossible for everyone to be perfect. God knew this when the law was handed down at Sinai, which is why a repentance was established as in option. Coincidentally, we are in the middle of the period devoted to repentance.

therefore everyone is judged a sinner

Everyone has sinned, but everyone can repent. Once you repent, the sin is washed clean.

therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law

One is not condemned to die just because you sin. Lots of people sinned in the Torah, and they didn't immediately die. There are very few sins whose punishment is death.

perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin

This statement doesn't even make sense. 

So, everyone is condemned to die

Again, doesn't follow.

unless, someone qualified steps up and takes on the punishment.

And even if it did, how is it justice for someone else to take your punishment for you? In fact, you should feel ashamed for allowing someone else to make the sacrifice you weren't able to make yourself.

The one that takes on the punishment has to be human, 

Again, this doesn't make sense. But if it did, why must they be human?

but they also have to be perfect so that they have the right and the qualification to take on the punishment of the imperfect.

Again, why? Even if you would make a substitution for a regular murder, the person who takes it doesn't have to be perfect.

And once the punishment has been meted out

And you think the law is for punishment, and once the punishment is gone the law can be gone? That's an awful view to take for something God given.

 the requirements of the law are fulfilled. But the law is not abolished.

It becomes the same thing. The law we are commanded to keep eternally would no longer be followed.

And then they refute that by saying that God is ONE. But they don't quote any scripture to back that up 

Yes, they do. Duet. 6:4

d I already refuted that claim in the above post - there are many places in the Torah that describe God as both ONE and MORE THAN ONE. The trinity isn't a foreign concept to the scriptures.

It is completely foreign. But that discussion is for another post. 




 What did he do, and how did he get farther than Jesus?

[He almost succeeded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) at expelling the Romans, creating a sovereign state, and rebuilding the Temple, returning Israel to it's former glory. Unfortunately, he failed, and that's that.

Prophecies.

Jesus didn't fulfill them.

Resurrection. Healings of the sick and afflicted.

What does these have to do with the Messiah?

 




 Translations are actually rather easy. Look at all the other occurrences, as well as the root word, and see what meaning it could be. You can do it yourself, [here's the link](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5959.htm). Look through each of the occurrences. Where can it mean specifically virgin, of which there is already a word in hebrew, as opposed to young woman. 




 Above you. 




 You can think a lot of things. Why do you think this with all the quotes of the Torah going against you? And that doesn't at all disqualify a trinitarian God either if it's all made up?
