 I'm eating right now a superb sweet potato and lentil dish.

1. In a slow cooker, put 3 peeled, cut in chunks sweet potatoes. Carrots and 2 cups of lentils.
2. In a small skillet, heat oil, put some chopped onions. Add some spices: curry, cumin, salt, pepper, ginger root, garlic. Mix. Add 2 cups of chicken broth, stir for a minute and pour everything into the slow cooker.
3. Put on low heat for 6 hours.
4. If you have green beans, add them now, let it cook for another hour.

The recipe is based on that [one](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-curried-sweet-potato-and-lentil-stew/841c60f3-3a01-4dec-bc31-c3e0c964a677), I just added more lentils and I prefer to saute onions before adding them to the cooker.

 Here's **Jamaican Jerk Chicken** from the book: *Slow Cooker Classics from Around the World*.

----

*Jerking is a method of seasoning and cooking meat that dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. Meat is marinated in a spicy pastelike sauce and then cooked slowly. Originally cooks would puncture the meat with a sharp object and stuff the holes with a variety of spices. The meat would then be cooked in a deep pit lined with stones over burning pimento (allspice) wood, which gave it a unique smoky flavor.*

----

#Ingredients

* 1 cup chopped sweet onions, like Vidalia
*  cup chopped scallions
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground allspice
*  teaspoon ground nutmeg
*  teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 whole jalapeo peppers, sliced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 4 pounds cut-up chicken pieces, skin removed

#One day ahead

Place all ingredients except chicken in the bowl of a food processor. Puree, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times, until mixture is smooth. Place chicken in a large freezer-weight zipper bag. Pour marinade mixture into bag. Close bag and massage chicken so that all pieces are well coated with marinade. Refrigerate chicken in bag overnight.

#To cook

Remove chicken from marinade and place in a 4-quart slow cooker. Discard marinade. Cook on low setting for 3 hours, until chicken has cooked through but is not falling off the bone.

Preheat a gas grill to medium-hot, about 450F. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side.

#To serve

Serve with steamed white rice or boiled fingerling potatoes.

----

*Jerk chicken usually calls for Scotch bonnet pepper, or the similar habanero. These are the hottest peppers in the capsicum family. I have lightened the spice in this recipe by using jalapeos, which are much milder. If you want to authenticate this recipe and love hot, hot, hot, substitute one scotch bonnet pepper for the jalapeos.*

 That can be a good argument by itself, but still, the context is grammatical in nature. 

 I paved a road, you created a business (pause) you didn't build **that**.

The question is what *that* refers to. The road or the business? If it's the business, then we can argue your point (can the carpenter claim he built the house?) but if *that* refers to the road, then there isn't any argument, because that statement is true. You didn't build the road, the government did, and you (maybe) paid taxes. 

Should have used **those**.

   survivors guilt could have easily convinced her that she 'must have known'

According to her statement, unless her memory made that up also, her father straight up told her what he's doing:

 He told me he killed girls.  
Again and again.  
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

Overall, when I rewatched season 1, I noticed that Abigail is portrayed (hinted) to be clever, distant, borderline sociopath and definitely hiding something (as Alana told Jack after first meeting her). I think this also explains why Hannibal was drawn to her so much. He knew what she's capable of. 

I think that the trauma made her forget the role the she played and the stuff she knew, but as the season progressed she became more self aware.

 I would have agreed with you, up until the final episode of the second season. [spoiler](#s "Gutting Will, arguably his best friend. Killed Abigail, which he seen like a daughter, in front of Will, which also loved her like his daughter.

 Of course not, don't get me wrong. Those aren't excuses at all. Those issues are the test, and it's obvious to me the US is failing most the tests it's facing. My point is that some countries almost aren't tested, and therefore shouldn't be scored, at least not on the same scale (and that's a good thing for them, really). 




 Could be, but then again, what are the challenges facing the press in Malta? Freedom of press is tested when the government has things to hide from the people.

 People who are claiming short selling is unethical simply don't understand how the market works and what motivates the players.

1. You are saying that short selling "promotes the spreading of false information". Here's the thing, short seller are the only players - ONLY PLAYERS - with a motivation to spread bad news. Companies, long holders, brokers, stock exchange, politicians - all care about good news. All want to sugar coat everything. All want the stock market in all time high day in day out, as long as the inevitable fall won't happen while they hold the potato.   
Short seller play a huge roll in unearthing information.

2. Short sellers also stop down trends. They have an incentive to book profit. During panics, they are a major force that actually buy stocks (to cover). Short sellers only profit when they are back in the market as buyers (as oppose to long holders who hold assets and not necessarily have to sell to realize profits).

3. Short selling ban isn't effective. It was stated even by the fed: [Short-Selling Bans Failed to Prevent U.S. Stock Price Declines - Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2012/rp120810.html).

4. Short selling plays a huge roll in arbitrage trading and forcing many financial instruments to behave as they should. For example, the reason ETFs are trading close to the indices they follow is because of short selling. If a certain ETF opens a gap from its index, arbitrage players long one and short the other. Because of that mechanism, regular retail investors can buy ETFs without worrying too much.

 Well, they did mention that a big part of the feud was because of an incident between Dickie and Raylan when they were children. Raylan hit Dickie's knee with a baseball bat leaving him with a lame leg. So it's only fair that he shot his other leg when they grew up. Classic Raylan.

  They just chat to dead characters who spew vague bullshit that rarely affects the narrative.

That's my main issue with hallucination scenes. I don't hate them, but they are so fucking predictable and boring. 

The hallucination is the Sopranos, after Tony was shot (season 6), was nicely done. It also lasted few episodes and had the right mix of nonsense and coherent plot.  




  They don't care, as long as production costs aren't incredibly high

The cost is only half of the equation. HBO cares about subscriptions. Their question is: does this show net generate or net eliminate subs? ratings, while giving some indication, don't answer that question. So in that sense, they don't care about them.  




 I also like to point out that numbers don't mean much without the overall trend (if homicide rate is [in decline for 2.5 decades](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Number_of_murders_by_year_in_Chicago.png), then permits got nothing to do with that).

I guess infographic with arrows is catchy, but the questions should be: was the trend accelerated? was it reversed? are there other factors in play around the same time? did it stay the same *despite* other counter-factors? and so on. 

It's hard and almost impossible to isolate specific variables in large social systems like crime or economy. 




 Shit, I was using one those words the other day. I'm going to file it under 5 words to not use again.

 There's a reason for that. If you are a stranger in a strange land, you often feel strongly the illusion of freedom. Especially if you have money. It's easy to live when you are off the grid, ignored by the day-to-day burdens like taxes, health insurance, career choices, family, kids.

Edit: another thing I'd like to add is that in free countries we feel unfree mostly because of what we hear by the media. See news and browse the internet looking for freedom, and you'll feel oppressed and depressed within a week. The flip side of it is when you travel to another country and you simply don't know what's going on around you. The dude is visiting China, one of the largest countries in the world with 1.5 Billion people, he's amazed of all the new things he learned, where in fact, it's like going to a safari in Africa, standing by the entrance and say: this is bullshit, there aren't any lions here, why people are so afraid?

 I think that people aren't looking for scores. They are looking for recommendations, which don't necessarily have to come in a form of a number.  




 I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I'm not saying checks and balances are a good thing. And I'm not saying courts are needed. 

I'm talking about the definition of democratic. And if courts sit within that definition. 

Democracy, is a form of ruling in which the people chooses representatives every once in a while, and those representatives rule the people. That's not my definition. That's the scholar definition. And a very narrow one. So we can work with that. If you go by the even narrower definition of "rule of the people", then obviously even a parliamentary system isn't democratic. That's fine, but we should work off the same base.

Some democracies are direct. People actually vote on laws. Some of the democracies are of indirect form: representatives make laws. Some of the democracies have few degrees: representatives pick other representatives. For example, the people votes for parties, the parties form a government with a prime minister. The people didn't vote directly for the prime minister, but they trust their elected to do so.

Still, all those forms fall within the scholar definition of democracy (again, not my definition, that's really not that interesting).

What I'm saying is that courts are an extension of that process. Same as the police. I elect someone, that person appoints chief of police (so by proxy, it's like I made that appointment), that chief of police goes back and arrests the person who elected him - **because that's what I, the people, want**. All still working within the democratic framework. 

Court is like the central bank or the FDA or the military or sub-committees - all extensions of the government and, by the democratic process, of the people. The fact that its power is used as a balance is irrelevant. So that's where you missed my point.

If, for example, the supreme court was going from father to son, or was a private company with no obligation to the general public. I would have agreed with you - it's undemocratic. If a constitution is irreversible and cannot be amended - it's undemocratic. If the king or queen has any role, it's undemocratic. 

Also, just to add something real quick: the fact that in some countries, high courts are appointed to life, is obviously undemocratic.  




  Courts being able overturn legislation is by the definition of most scholars technically undemocratic.

I'm not sure about that. First, in many cases courts are appointed/approved by the an elected officials (or their representatives), so they are democratic by proxy. Second, courts interpret the law, which was also written by elected officials. They don't make up new laws. So that's again democratic. Third, they find contradictions between the law and the constitution. Meaning, they make sure the legislative branch is operating within the boundaries of the law (you can't rob someone, they can't make laws that contradict other laws).

There can be some exceptions here and there (just like a president or prime minister overusing executive power), but the overall structure is still inherently democratic.

 Okay, it's kind of a weird one. The husband is a high level manager in a weapon technology company. He and his wife relocated to Singapore for a couple of years to be his company's representative in the east. They lived really well over there. Just few months in, his wife got into coma. I really don't know the exact circumstances of that. She was treated there and he decided to stay (instead of moving back with her to his home country). He was able to get her mom a visa and flew her there also. 

A little more than a year passed, probably the longest year in his life,  and she woke up. After 1-2 weeks in the hospital (physical therapy, checks and such)  she was released. However, she was completely different person.

She started getting into mystical stuff, Buddhism, crystals, connection with the after life, tarot reading. She started playing guitar.

None of the things she had mattered to her. She hated the luxury apartment building they lived in, hated that she had a chauffeur and a maid, hated money and hated her husband's job. 

It's not like she was ungrateful or resentful. She was simply different. Anyway, that's how he described it. He loved her deeply, but it's like they had nothing in common. Almost felt like an arranged marriage. 

I met her couple of years ago (which was about 5 years after she left him) and she was nice, but very hard to talk to. She seemed detached a little bit. Still into that mystical stuff (I guess, because she mentioned something about my aura).

I don't know what happened to her while she was in a coma, and I don't know if other people react like that and how commom this is. But I guess it can change a person.  




 X post to /r/crappydesign. 




 Yeah, in Hollywood films the men always have courage when women are involved. I guess they were trying to show something different. 









  you name it, she will have it

Also, there's no guarantee she'll even want to be in a relationship after she wakes up. I know someone who woke up after a year of coma, and few months after divorced her husband. She wad changed, and needed time to find herself again. 

If she'll be in the same situation (who knows), OP will feel betrayed. It will crush him. But then again, you can't really blame her for that.

 Yes, I'm with you here. Besides, telling anything meaningful to anybody you don't know, is mostly stupid. 




 Yes, but to be fair, OP didn't say: "I don't have money, so I'm not going to spend it on entertainment" (which is a valid statement, regardless of the money you have or the cost). He said: "I'm broke... next month for sure!", meaning he wants to spend $5 on something like that, but he can't do it right now. That's a very fragile situation to be in, and one should probably try to change it as much as they can.

 Re Ponzi scheme. First I wouldn't call it a scheme. It's perfectly clear what's going on, and nobody is trying to deceive or sell a malfunction product here. 

Second, it does rely on a constant stream of paying people to support the previously paying people. Same way as an insurance company client who is depended on other clients, or the company won't have enough to pay him when needed.

Now, we don't need anybody to stop paying taxes, that's an extreme scenario. But what if life expectancy goes higher (without enhanced quality), meaning people will stop working at 70 but will live until 140? That's not far fetched, and it's actually the current trend. Or what if less people will decide to have children while immigration is staying low? Japan is facing that problem. 

I'm not saying SS is bad by any means, I'm glad societies have nets. However, we can't ignore the risk and the price of those programs. They might stop working.

 Of course, you are right. So the problem is shareholders aren't doing their job and rubber stamp other people's decisions. That needs to be changed. 

About institutional investors. This is only partially correct. The majority holders at large firms are institutional. But those are mostly mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity and such). The investors in those funds get to vote, and they even get periodically proxy vote by mail. If they ignore it, the fund will vote for them.

Anyway, saying that CEO get high compensation because of some committee is really putting the blame on the least significant part of the entire process.  




 Google is a growing company. Their 25+ PE indicates investors also perceive it that way. They expect the company to grow and invest in opportunities as it see fits, and they are willing to pay a premium for that chance. Paying dividends will send the opposite signal and will probably crash the stock price on the long term.  




  CEO compensation committee

I'm sorry but no committee is determining the CEO compensation. The committee, if exists - not all companies have it - is part of the board of directors and simply recommends the best salary they see fit. The board is the one that decides and approves compensations.

The board is also directly assigned by the shareholders. And many times CEO compensation goes to a vote by the shareholders.  Also, in some countries there's "say on pay" corporate laws, which means that even if the board made a salary decision without shareholders vote, they (the shareholders) are entitled to call the compensation to a vote and change it.

TL;DR instead of blaming the board is we should blame (the far being CEOs) shareholder.

 To be fair, you want to hire a person that takes his hobbies seriously, yet still keep it under control. OP, you should have checked that one.  




 Someone should X it to /r/bestof. 




 You can merge this [file](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip) with your host file.

Also see: [How to edit host files](http://www.sysprobs.com/how-to-edit-host-file-in-windows-8-1-8)

There are several disadvantages of using host file:
 
1. It's hard to keep the list up-to-date.
2. It takes time to modify it if you want to enable ads (for example, a site doesn't load, and you want to enable ads to see if that's the problem).
3. You can't whitelist sites (for example, you can't enable ads on Reddit).
4. It won't work if the ad is hosted on a legitimate domain.
5. It probably doesn't block YouTube ads (but I'm not sure) 




 Pucks. 



















 You get interest from the broker, depends on the agreement you have with it (which is the borrowing costs the short seller is paying for the privilege to sell a stock that he didn't buy). The interest rate can be regular market interest or it can be higher for "hard to borrow" securities. Also keep in mind that some brokers won't even tell you they are lending your stocks to someone else. I'm not sure if they are obligated to inform you or even pay you. 









 Depth gif maybe? 




 Yeah, but BB just ended last year. in 5 years (at least), which is probably the time between the end of the show and the last book people will discuss spoilers without even mentioning them as spoilers. You'll just see images and references.  




 As in the famous words of McNulty: Shit never fucking changes. 




 Oh man, thanks for sharing this. I think I watched the entire show all 20 seasons at least 3 times, not counting all the random reruns. I miss Orbach, and if this is from March 2004, so it's about half a year before he died.  




 "You look sad, is everything okay?" is better than "I can see the pain when I looked into your eyes, oh and you are pretty". 




 Why in hell aren't you turning off subreddits' styles? That's the real question here. 




 Nothing can be assumed safe. For anything else, /r/conspiracy. 




 Okay, so that's a different point: no culture is really explored. Maybe that's right, I don't claim to support or oppose it. Western culture are familiar to the world (not just to western players), so it's hard to draw the line on where the exploration begins and when the knowing just exists. 

For example, I'm playing now Dragon Age: Inquisition. Knights Templar, Chantry, and other similar terms are all from the western christian history. They need little exploration, because they are known. If they used terms from the Yoruba religion, they would have needed much more exploration and explanation. 

Other games have hundreds of references to American culture (language, media, style, technology, appearance). The nuances are built in.

 Giving 1 or 2 examples of each region (out of thousands of games) pretty much proves OP's point. The examples themselves are also very poor. Placing a zombie game in Turkey doesn't exactly explore the culture (exactly as Spec Ops: The Line doesn't explore Dubai). It's just different settings.

 Another twist: the parents hated the house and their life, so they committed suicide by setting it on fire. You get nothing.

 I also didn't know what the pro benefits are. I knew there's 50/50 chance to read it in the article, and 100% chance to read it in the top 3 comments. Unless the subject of the article is something I find interesting in general, I'll go straight to read the discussion. 




 Exactly, dolls. 




 He was. Of the River-folk. Before the ring corrupted him completely.

Edit: here, that's the Hobbit bread, Stoors.  http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stoors 




 I agree with you, but consider that it's kind of a mystery exactly how the ring affects the bearer. Especially Hobbits, which considered to be special kind when it comes to the ring. That's what defines Bilbo so nicely, he's being the exception here. Don't forget that Smeagol, another Hobbit, killed his best friend just moments after finding it.  




 For *expectation* of 4% rise in rates, you'll probably see 20-25% drop in LT bonds. 




 The Idiot is a great book. It's a good start to his work. As always with Russian classics, it's good to read also some brief guide about the major themes. I do that after I'm half way through.  




 But isn't TC an open source? I'm still using 6.1a and didn't see any reason to think it's compromised. Am I wrong here? What's a good alternative?  




 Or, and I'm going to through a wild far fetched theory here, maybe in the 50's there were very few cameras and most of the photos we see today were made by professionals to look nice and tidy. Those who looked bad were thrown away. AKA survivorship bias. 




 That was after Kanye Paul collaboration. It had 1,065 views 2 months ago. I know because it was posted to /r/listentoobscure.

 Too many Cooks.

Use VT to cover equity. Use BND and BNDX to cover debt. Use VNQ and VNQI to cover REIT. That's it. 




 Here's the my method of cooking a perfect rice in a pot. It works every time. For me, it always tastes better than rice cooker. So give it a try:

1. Heat 1 spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid
2. Boil water in a separate pot (or use water boiler)
3. Add 1 chopped onion to the heated oil. Saute until soft and transparent.
4. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot. Stir it so it will all be covered in oil. about 2-3 minutes. This will prevent the rice from sticking, and it also hardens it a little.
5. At this point your water should be boiled and ready.
6. Add 1.75 cups of boiled water. Add another cup for extra cups of rice you used (so if you cooked 2 cups of rice, that would be 2.75 cups of water).
7. Stir just a little, make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer (pretty much the minimal heat).
8. Let it cook for 20 minutes, don't touch it.
9. After 20 minutes, the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot. Uncover, stir gently with a fork, let it rest for 10 minutes.
10. That's it.

Now, the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies. It depends on the type of rice (short, medium or long grain, where it came from, etc.). So the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste.

  I wish dates were like this still

Then got out with your date and drink a fucking milkshake in a diner, it's not like it's illegal.

 




 And the name of Comcast CEO? Bill Cosby. 




 They don't lose money. I have IBM stock, I give it to you, you bring it to me back after some time. I don't care about the price of the stock, because the share is the same. The broker is just the middleman, helping us meet without knowing each other, and making sure that we both meet our end of the deal. 




  I am but a simple scientist. 

No shit, Sherlock. 




 For 6 seasons, they were both in each other's business, with separate plots that always cross paths somehow. However, they only meet 2-3 times each season. 

That makes each conversation intense without overdoing it. They have this unique blend of knowing one another ("I know him, we used to dig coal together") and still be on the opposite sides, trying to figure out what the next move and what each is hiding. 




 Don't forget for a second the 47%. 




 I didn't say easy, I said easiest. Other sides in trading are not only harder but also harder to learn: position sizing, risk management, trade management, portfolio construction, emotional obstacles, biases, big picture, etc. When taking advice from TV (Cramer or others) you never learn about those parts and they never touch it. 









 He's a smart man and knows the business inside-out (wallstreet, trading and tv), but I wouldn't take stock advice from him. Not because he's often wrong (and he is. Nobody can discuss 10-12 stocks daily on TV without being often wrong) but mainly because it's bad practice. Besides, picking stocks is the easiest part if you want to trade successfully.  




 Looks like you don't know that English was a Christian tradition, started by Slavic to absorb the Germanic language. Which I find comic as fuck. I guess I'm just a good bad serial person. Soz. 




 I used to watch that show on a daily basis in the gym. It's great financial entertainment, but I wouldn't take any advice from it (nor would I take from anything on TV). Edit: I was just making a general comment. You picked a good show for OP. 




 Israel doesn't have a constitution, some states don't (UK and NZ, for example). However, they do have [Basic Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel), which is very close. They define the roles of the government and civil rights [Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Human_Dignity_and_Liberty_(Israel) being one of them). The legislative branch cannot draw laws that contradicts the Basic Laws, or the court will overturn them (it happened before).

He started going to crime scenes only after he met Will and Jack (and actually wasn't part of many investigations in the first season). He was a killer long before that. 




 There wasn't a consensus a year ago that oil will drop below 50, so why pay attention to it now? Did people who didn't predict the largest fall in decades suddenly have divine insight on oil prices?


 














 Recently, as in, probably yesterday and I just woke up and saw it. 




 /r/pettyrevenge should take a note on how it's done. 




 How about **Treating Women Like Dogs**, 273 points, from "Endorsed Contributor", 3 days ago. Lovely place. 




 115% is still a very small pop considering how the situation changed for them. Not saying that CUBA fund is the best investment vehicle or if they represent anything meaningful. If there was a legit stock market there, I wouldn't be surprised to see its total index raised 10 fold in the coming years. 




 I liked this joke. That being said, I didn't. 




 Their punishment: from now on, whenever Reddit is mentioned in ESPN, they should call it unsarcastically  Le Reddit. Now that's humiliation.
