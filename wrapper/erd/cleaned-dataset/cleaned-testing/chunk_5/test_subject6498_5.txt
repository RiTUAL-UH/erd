 To those who say it's more hygienic I respond:

Soap.

And that's basically the end of that discussion even if they desperately try a few more arguments before going away.

I frickin' love this song. It has me screaming the chorus every time.

And there's also a cover I really enjoy as well.

 I'm from Sweden, And this live version where the featuring Miss Li breaks down into tears makes me wish you all understood Swedish.

 If it's brown, lay the fuck down.
If it's black, attack!
If it's white. Good night.

Since we only got brown bears. Play dead. And u'r probably good.

edit: To clarify I mean bears.  




 Sweden here. There's actually a small chance I've chased that goose with a pickup truck.  




 He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight!

Holding Out for a Hero - Bonnie Tyler

 




 [Age of Mythology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A17oUv0E-N4)

Exactly how you feel playing the game. 




 Let's get down to business!
I've always loved Mulan. I hold it as one of Disney's best along with The Lion King and The Beauty and the Beast. I haven't noticed any cult following.
 




 Jared Leto is my man crush. 




 The more I drank, the more I shat. But the more I shat the thirstier I grew.  




 I have a bit of homemade tinfoil. Noone believes me, but I'm fairly certain there is something to it, but maybe not what I think. Anyway.


Bran climbed the walls of Winterfell so many times that he knew every rock. 

He has gotten better and better at warging Hodor. It will culminate with Bran somehow warging/influencing Ser Duncan the Tall. Thick as a **castle wall**

My theory is rooted in Bran's nagging about wanting to be a knight, people telling him he can't ever be. But Dunk was never knighted!

And a line from The Sworn Sword. when Dunk defies his sworn lord and sends the poor villagers home, practically saving their lives. "It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior". 




 Watchmen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVUDdQS2UxA

I count that as the opening. Even though there's a fight sequence before it. 




 Yes, I am quite a phobic. The one laying at a cliff had my heart racing because we had to pass it closely on the path we were on and the guides were quite nervous which were noticeable. 

The green one and the striped one in the waters were as you say docile, and very beautiful to watch.  




 Yeah that looks exactly like it. I was about 8 meters away, but there was a dude swimming closer with a camera so I guess it was something worth photographing. If so that's one of the most venomous snakes in the world? 




 Oh yeah, this video has one that shows similarity! thanks.

I also photographed another beatiful snake that they told us was harmless. So we were really close to it. http://imgur.com/a/aFdg2


 




 Saw some snakes on an island in Thailand 2009. What kinds are they?

I also spotted one when snorkeling. I don't have a photo but it was around half a meter long, striped black and blue. 




 No, but you buy a lot from Russia to keep the costs down. If you could buy from Sweden it opens up your market which could lead to independece where you can freely choose by your liking and that will bring prices down.


Since you're a member of Nato, an outside powerline pointing away from Russian territories is certainly in your own best interest. 




 People and animals have survived more than one ice age where basically the whole of the northern hemisphere where covered in permafrost. Chances are high both of our ancestors have lived through decades, maybe even centuries of complete winter. 

I think they have gotten used to it and people may die but the rest always carry on. Wow. Story of life. 




 Swedish Jan Guillou wrote the  autobiographical novel "Evil" which movie adaption (2003) got an oscar nomination for best foreign film. 

On Topic: He also wrote a trilogy about late 12th century Sweden. Called **The Templar Knight**

**Short Synopsis:**
An unstable Sweden before it was Sweden. 

In one of families fighting with the present king is Arn who get sent to a monastery as a young boy. There he learn one of the foreign Monks once was a Templar Knight in "The Holy Land". 

About a third of books takes place in an around Jerusalem and Gaza. It tells the buildup to the Battle of Hattin and about the major characters involved in that battle.

I recommend both the books and the movies which got Stellan Skarsgrd and a lot of swedish people. Boys and girls. 




 I think The Trooper is as good a historic lyric as Alfred Tennyson's poem about the same battle.

And the foolish Earl Cardigan spawned out of the aristocratic England still got a mark in history as a frickin' sweater. 




 Have a nice summer folks.
Added 5 songs but only one of them is ABBA. // Swedish guy
(Be Free With Your Love - Spandau Ballet is awesome) 




 Is it just me, or is 10 kWh a pretty low number for a lithium battery? At least in the car? 

 




 HBO owns the rights to Westeros... 

I hope they tie up Bloodraven's past in the show with Bran next season to lay the groundwork for Dunk and Egg. That would be the best buddy cop series ever.  




 Who's got two thumbs and doesn't give a crap?  




 You can't take the sky from me! 




 Yeah. I thought the article was prettty good untill that last paragraph..
But it is no secret that The United States of America has a complicated relationship with religion. 

I guess that's what happens when people don't have healthcare. 




 Rendevous is a bitch. Docking is the bitch's bitch mother. 




 At least the Finns put their foot down when Putin crosses the line.  




 You should watch Neil Degrasse Tyson's Nova science programme about animal intelligence. First 15 minutes is about a border collie that made me think k differently about how dogs reason.  









 I should really give CK2 another chance.. 









 Donate at Nexus or Moddb instead! 




 Awesome with a new theory. I like it, but taking it as a fact that Starks married Others are a little too much, even though it could be so. 




 I hope you have at least tried Mount and Blade: Warband with the mod Clash of Kings?
I would say that is the best playable version of Westeros where you can carve your way as a Hedge Knight to a rich Lord. 




 The Christmas Carol could work. 
Also show her "are you my mommy?"  




 I hate Mace Tyrell in the show. He's such a bottomless character just put there for comic relief. It wasn't even funny in his first scenes. Can't fathom how they carried it into season 5... 




 I feel like upkeep costs are higher for the land owning lords of Westeros than it is in Essos. Slaves and such makes for cheap labour for when it's needed. And Wine is cheap. 




 Their attitude reminds me of "CD PROJEKT RED". Developers of The Witcher.
 




 Thank you whoever made this. 




 Didn't read the Potter leak, and I would not read a leaked half of tWoW either. 




 No. He should finish Dunk and Egg.
I think they are tightly connected with asoiaf story wise. Even more so than we think.  




 I'd go to the riverlands and tell Brienne where the fair maid of three and ten is. 
You're welcome.  




 Especially true when you watch last week's episode of Better Call Saul.  




 The Artwork will make you jizz your pants. And I don't even care that that expression is to old for carbon-14. It is still so true. 

Dunk vs Baratheon is so beautiful it makes me cry. 




 Yes, of course. Thanks.

Or maybe "Et tu, Brutus?" 




 Knives in the Dark. 
 




 You should watch the Hornblower series. Great British naval drama.  




 Not a Number is a nightmare. Every number it comes into contact with will corrupt that number. It spreads like wildfire.

Can result in an entire savefile becoming corrupt. 




 I'm too rookie to help out, but I'm following this project.

I just want to ask, how are you planning to document this? Will you stream important parts on twitch, make a youtube series?

Also, how long will it take between the first launch and the landing on Mars in real time? 




 If you get your money buffer up a bit, you could try trading. Keep tabs on selling prices for stuff. 

Otherwise killing bandits will get you renown and loot money. Renown increases your party size. Build a good mix of party members and set your companions out to higher your right to rule. When it's high enough you might want to try a kingdom of your own.  




 Do you call Breaking Bad - "Breaking Bad"?  




 Swedish: "Sagan om Is och Eld." 

The Saga about Ice and Fire. 

The Nordic countries are really big on "sagas"  




 This is what I've always pictured them as. Glad to see someone else know how this should be done. Please hbo. It's right there.  




 I enjoy watch grrm talk,  but lately I think George have become a bit of a hypocrite. Some people will tear me a new asshole or call me unfair for criticizing him, because apparently he is God.

But here we go.. All he's ever talked about in interviews is how he like to make his readers feel unsafe when their favorite character is threatened. And I have agreed with him. I did feel unsafe reading Game of Thrones.. At least after Ned's beheading. 

But now he's changed perspective completely. Apparently it doesn't matter if you are worried about you characters when you read anymore. Now it's the "journey that matters" nevermind what he has always said before... 

I just think it would be more admirable if he faced the problem with his back straight, admitting this is not an ideal situation, but we just have to cope. 

Instead of changing his point of view to fit HBO's opinion...  




 George wrote one verse and the "chorus", correct me if I'm wrong. 

And who are you, the proud lord said,

that I must bow so low?

Only a cat of a different coat,

that's all the truth I know.

In a coat of gold or a coat of red,

a lion still has claws,

And mine are long and sharp, my lord,

as long and sharp as yours.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke,

that Lord of Castamere,

But now the rains weep o'er his hall,

with no one there to hear.

Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,

and not a soul to hear. 




 Couldn't you contact reddit to make them kick the troublemakers out the door?  




 Nice, yes as mentioned this is the sub your find looking for astrophysics, I just stumbled in here 10 minutes ago to post a question about time acting really weird between binary black holes. I hope someone with knowledge will sharpen my mind on that topic. 

As for keeping a sub like this growing. Make it look like a sub about astrophysics. Satellites, galaxies, corny stuff like that makes for a great banner together with a well designed logo.

 Keep a steady flow of interesting news, but don't drown out discussions posted by the rest. 

Oh, and I like when the link to the sub's front page in the upper left corner is in an image bigger than the small link I keep missing on my mobile/pad

Good luck with moderating this exciting sub!  




 Cars turning right takes the outer road, if they're going straight through, left or making a u-turn goes through the middle.  




 Made this roundabout to liven up my griddy city center. 
It's one of my few own assets, and I really like how it looks. 

Would like to hear what people think about it!

Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405935320 searchtext=Double+roundabout+with+overwalk 




 Well, taking on the role as the broken record no one wants to be. I would have played good money to see my friends witness Lady Stoneheart. 

At least it's not definite she's cut. 

Also Bran's first dream where he flies and sees the whole world.  









 This should be a feature. That's one thing Sim City made pretty good. Recycling plastic and metals for use in factories was awesome. Especially in big educated cities this could be a huge profit. Sweden import trash from Norway to benefit from this. 




 Dunk   Egg Spinoff. Please just do it. 




 **There should be an easy way** to see if a specialized building is producing raw material or manufactured goods. 




 The Show is on Netflix. At least in Sweden. The new seasons are on the internet if you look hard enough. 




 Una Mattina by Ludovico Einardi from The Intouchables.  




 I'd argue saying a word of mouth wheel like this where streams spread the word makes for a tighter community. People watching streams are often active on forums such as reddit.  




 Same here.. At least for the chill gamez like KSP, Total War, etc. 




 Since trees are a resource I am sceptical it will be implemented into the game. 

You can already place trees ingame though, but not by brush. 




 Great idea! Land value could be a way of controlling education-level provided. 




 If they manage their expansion-development mainly focusing on adding more features, leaving textures and modelling largely to the community they could keep this game alive for years with people keep buying expansions. 




 I don't have a good sense of reference because I'm only active in a couple of subs. But how many subscribers are that for a game releasing in 3 days?  




 Probably means he's gonna lose an ear. (hope I got that twin right) 




 I love her in the first season. She has suffered from bad writing as a result of them trying to recreate "Dracarys" over and over.  




 Are you German or is that word taking root? The English language has been missing it for to long.  




 I'm ten minutes in, and I find your podcast really interesting!

I admit I haven't listened to many others before, but those I have tried has not caught my attention. 




 Agree with your order completely!  




 tuung 




 I need to see that one. Sounds like me watching the show with my unsullied friends.  




 The paning through the images feel a bit off sometimes. Try zooming out from faces, keeping the attention on the characters. And the voice the reader does for Dunk is horrible. 

Otherwise the moods and everything feels great. I can imagine the process to be quite time consuming, but I could see this as a nice way of enjoying the story though copyright will most likely take it down.  




  In theory.  




 I call bs on all news twow that doesn't come from grrm himself.  




 I think they should wait for multiplayer.. It would really boost sales.  




 I find let's plays without narrating a bit pointless. But I understand, it's hard to find something to talk about and I think Scott Manley got it right with the "New me" and "Old me". That way you can put voiceover where you blabber about pointless things, say something stupid. Or such :) 
Also, fastforward your launches. I get tired by just watching my own, again and again! ^^

Anpther tip is to do a better description. List your mods and stuff and do a short summery of what the episode is all about. 

Otherwise I really liked the video and the creations. 




 Rhaegar were firstborn and therefore heir to the throne, if Jon is his trueborn son by a secret marriage (I doubt it)

Jon would be next in line (if Aegon is fake)  




 I'd take the liberty to say that the garrison's morale would improve slightly if food came after nearly two years under siege.. 




 I do it to free up my hands for other stuff. It's great to just put on headset and do some dishes while you listen to the battle of the blackwater. (did that today)

Biking to school, grocery shopping. Well. All tedious stuff you have to do becomes enjoyable. I discovered time goes a lot faster while you're concentrating on a book than it does listening to music. 




 The hour of creature is just common saying. In Swedish for example we have "vargatimmen", or "the hour of the wolf" which is the hours just before dawn. 

 




 Short film based on a poem by Terry Bisson.

 Great with a new fleshy interview! 




 Hey, that was awesome! Both text and music!

 EmergencyAwesome is the most generic and robotlike youtuber I have ever come across. I have seen a lot of his aSoIaF-videos, and wow.

He really is proof that anyone can be a youtuber if you work(edit) hard enough. And I can respect that! 




 Yeah! I think I noticed that line to when reading the comic. Dunk   Egg are so underrated. 




 hear, hear. 




 Yeah, Tyrells are like Italians.  




 wow.. this will be so lame. as tthorn23 said. Buy the strategy board game instead, prefferably with Feast for Crows expansion pack. 









 Took me about 12 hours to manage the same. But I had a dude guiding me when I needed some help. Congratulations on your accomplishment! 

The amazing feeling you felt when you landed will happen again, and again and again. That's the beauty of this game! 




 Ari Gold. He would probably be king or the Castle.  




 Well, it's the three released novellas released with artwork on every page. Not a comic but an illustrated book. 




 It is known.
