 LOL "No dude.. I don't want them to tell me what she did... I just want them to tell me what she did."  

its a dumbass a minute here in /r/news....    




 Too stupid for that realization to have a positive effect on choices.   




 The question is based off false premise.  I will not be suckered into a dogma trap.   *The debate was about the misrepresentation of the Cuban program and the difference between what Americans think "quarantine" is vs. what it ACTUALLY is.*   That's it.

Your further echoing of the misconceptions is proof that people don't have a fucking clue about what the program actually was or is.  Instead, you try and sucker the debate into, "should we or shouldn't we do this in the USA".... when ironically, we do a LOT WORSE in the USA where we criminalize and punish medical problems.  When on the contrary, this internationally participated cuban program did nothing oppressive and instead lifted people up.   

So you can try to obfuscate with hypotheticals all you want but THE REALITY of the situation is that no one was oppressed or punished or abused, harmed, or had a gun pointed in their face.   They didn't round up masses of people who had or were accused of having AIDS.  They simply said, "Come to our clinics, get tested, and if positive we will enroll you into this medical program.   No one marched anyone into those government offices with a goddamn gun. And the public saw how well it was working out for people with a disease that kills millions, that people who got AIDS happily walked into the office and got the care they needed.   

I deal in facts... not made up situations and dishonest ignorance.   

"What if the cuban government used guns?"  

"They didn't" 

"no dude but what if.... you know it's CUBA" 

"Ok but they didn't need to use guns because the patients came to them on their own free will"  

"Yeah but if they didn't want to... cuba guns!" 


They don't use guns because the people who don't want to participate simply don't get tested in the government clinic.    But who'd not want all that sweet medical care to make sure this death sentence doesn't kill them?   No one.   Which is why it worked and why they don't needs guns, didn't use guns, and had no plans on ever using guns to enforce the law.    

*Laws don't need guns if they actually help people.  Because there is already huge incentive to follow the law if it benefits you in some way.*   

But who could blame you, you're so used to living under "You can't you can't you can't" USA laws.

But does anyone else get the feeling that Trump is working for democrats to make republicans look bad?  




 The issue of the debate is the misrepresentation of what this Cuba program was.  And how people see the word "quarantine" and they equate it with punishment and abuse.  Americans are so used to punishement being apart of the system that they think it is apart of every system.  It has nothing to do with the USA treating medical needs as criminal acts.  (which is far worse than what cuba is doing with this program). The USA practice of criminalizing and punishing medical problems displays a reality that is... well... sickeningly ironic.  Yet you just keep blabbing about "its criminal".   Which supports my point.   

But to clarify: This isn't about that.... this debate was about what this cuba program REALLY was, and how ignorant people don't have a fucking clue what "quarantine" is in real life.  


The only thing most of them know about what "quarantine" is, is a hollywood misrepresentation. And this debate proves that because people keep arguing from the false premise that AIDS patients were being punished and that quarantine=punishment.  


This is the same misrepresentation that you keep echoing here.   I can abide ignorance... but willful ignorance.  That just makes me sick to my stomach.  I'd feel sorry for you if I didn't feel like barfing right now.  

I'm  done here.   




 I hindsight it was Andy Kaufman humor I think.   It's funny because it's so very not funny.... 


I never liked andy. 




 The only thing insulting here is your direct misrepresentation of what this program was and your ignorance behind what quarantine actually is.  But hey, I guess I can't blame you because you've succumbed to accepting that everything in this world is centered around punishment; like many in the USA have.

Good luck being willfully ignorant.  It's so bad it's almost dishonest. 




 What?   The government wasn't involved. In either case of Cuba or the usa.   

Cuba had 2 other international groups involved and the USA the government clinics were the main group trying to help whilst the private institutions fucked over patients.   We're you even alive during this time?  

Edit: the discussion was about the misrepresentation of the Cuba program and not if we should do it in the USA or not.  Which we do...  but that's another can of worms.   

 




 ^good ^story. 




 Yeah, no guns were used.  You know there were 2 other international groups involved with this right?   I'm just going to put you on ignore because you're a fucking obfuscating moron.  And you don't even know enough about the issue to discuss it properly.   Gotta be trollolololing all the the way to trollololol land.   




 Oh okay so in the USA we treat people with a disease as criminals and lock them up in shitty rehab facilities that don't really help them. 

Cuba took people with a disease that kills millions upon millions, and is scary as fuck... they take them and care for them, and help with with mental health, with medicine, with education and the results were fantastic.

Oh but because some men with guns MIGHT show up (we don't know that they would) it's all bad.  

I'm done replying to you now.  You're ridiculous.    




 Well let see... that never happened so apparently what they are doing is working for them.   

The point is people are making shit up and misrepresenting the facts.  Whilst ignoring that we do a LOT worse in the USA.    




 They send a mental health professional to convince you to go.  SO you do. 




 The funny thing is, that the program was so great that no one ever had to use guns.  The patients were glad to go! So I guess we'll never know if they would use guns or not. 

 How naive you must be to think that's not the case.

But that isn't the case... you just made it up.  No guns were used or need to be used because people go so willingly because it takes good care of them.   LOL.   Just make shit up and claim people are naive for not agreeing with it.  

 




 No no....We were discussing purely what cuba did and how he misrepresented it.  

No one is talking about doing this in the USA.  

The issue was, that he was making it out to be some kind of brutal men with guns quarantine, when it was absolutely NOTHING like that. 

And again... the USA quarantines drug abusers all the time.    




 Fair point.  However, I have to point out that those diseases didn't come with irrational fear (because ignorance), and they also didn't come with a social stigma attached.  If you had AIDS, it automatically meant you were a homosexual and/or drug abuser.  Did anyone stop to think that you weren't either of those two things and that you might have simply caught it from having sex with monkeys?   

I joke, but that's what it was like for sufferers during the late 80s and most of the 90s.   It's a joke and it's not fucking funny; but it was the sophomoric reality that people with AIDS had to deal with. 

No one with diabetes had to face that kind of stupidity or scrutiny.       

Aside from STDs, no other disease really comes with that stigma. The medical community based a lot of its initial reaction to the AIDS crisis on irrational fears rather than science.  The medical community didn't really know what to do and AIDS was scary as fuck.  
 




 Good thing that isn't what is happening here.   




 I'm not talking about white guys who claim to be rasta.  I'm talking about the core of the religion in Jamaica... it isn't welcoming to whites.  It doesn't regard whites as evil.  [It regards blacks as superior and they will eventually rule the world.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/beliefs/black.shtml)  

These ideas were developed in part by [Marcus Garvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey), who is considered a prophet by many rastafarians.   

These white dudes in the USA just claim to be rasta because some marijuana is used in some rituals and they think it gives them the freedom to get stoned.  

We will see fewer and fewer white dudes resorting to these measures as marijuana becomes legal.  There's no reason for the act anymore.... as if a judge would actually buy the "religious freedom" shit about white rastafarians smoking dope at a Big Day Out concert.  

 




 ok then.  I guess i don't mind then.    




 The alcohol religion already exists.  Catholics consume shitloads of wine.    




 Isn't the Rastafarian church prohibitive towards whites in general?   




 I love this verse.   Cannabis was used as medicine and relaxation during the bible times.  

"For so the Lord said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."  Isaiah ch18 v 4   

Isaiah went home to relax and smoke some weed.  God told him to do it.

Edit:  In the next verse he goes on to talk about how and when to properly harvest the purple sticky punch.  

*"5 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches."* Isaiah 18v5   

So he tells us when to get the PRIMO nugs.   Which is when they are about the size of grapes... as they would have been before modern genetic strains.   The buds would be purple or green and have a sour smell.  And you cut away the branches so they don't dry out and pull water from the buds.

 The USA was terrible in its treatment of AIDs patients until about 2000... even then, people could not afford treatment and were forced to utilize the free clinics.   Which did nothing for the patient but send them back on the street with a script for medicine they couldn't afford.  


You keep insinuating that men with guns shipped people off.... they didn't.   This is no different than a government mandating that drug users be quarantined to locked down rehabilitation institutions. 
 
Oh But because **"Cuba"** this program HAD to be brutal, with crying people screaming with outstretched arms and spread fingers, as they are stripped from their loved ones, and thrown in the back of a some wagon and hauled away For e Ver..

Get real....


   

 




 Your ignorance about what quarantine actually is, is astounding.    

You sound like you think quarantine is like what they show on television.... It's not.

Edit: you need to go fucking read about the "quarantine"  of these patients and how they were treated.  They were well provided for and many volunteered go stay longer than the mandatory treatment.   They weren't mistreated in any way  and most of the patients expressed how happy they were to have the service.   

They considered what they received as a gift.   Yet you keep acting like they were terribly treated and stuck in some prison dungeon somewhere.   Lol gtfo with that nonsense.

In many developed nations the patient is just sent to deal on their own and rot to death in ignorance.

 Yeah this " evolution" has worked out great for the middle class, has it not? 




 OK they weren't locked up in a torture chamber Hollywood depiction quarantine.....   they were very comfortable and received mental health care, medicine, and education about their disease.  

The headline made it seem like men with guns were taking people against their will and locking them away in torture chambers forever.  


They were not. And most of the patients were happy about it when it was over.  

Yet people like you keep acting like it was E.T. or outbreak or a zombie movie....  




 A service based economy, which is essentially economy based on doing each other's laundry, may create jobs but does not create wealth.

 Yes!  It's because the only gay they are exposed to are the perverts running around naked and doing lude things at the gay pride parade.

 Exactly.  It doesn't matter if a quote contradicts the outcome.... 

That's more like real life.  In reality we've got lots of good quotes from real people that contradicts with the condition of our world.

 I think it's a testament to his ability to write a dynamic story.   Not every character was the same or delivered the same message.

 AIDs is nothing like those other diseases you mentioned so we can just scrap that part of the discussion into the false premise can.   


Who's advocating we lock people up into torture centers? 

NO ONE.   


But you can send people to a comfortable place, where they can be educated about their new disease, given medicine to prolong their health, and receive an endless number of benefits.   As we are seeing, these types of programs are working and the patients themselves are taking value in them.   

Who the fuck here has advocated that we lock anyone into a torture chamber where they receive no care and are victimized?   

NOT A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON.  

You're right... it's DEFINITELY a dumbass a minute right now.    Fucking acting like people are saying we should lock people up in hollywood's idea of quarantine, never to be released.   Pllllzzzzz.... gtfo with that nonsense LOL  




 Without a doubt, there should be no choice about quarantine when it comes to contagious diseases like Ebola.   

That being said these types of diseases, while super fast acting, sort of snuff themselves out easier.  

AIDs kills far more people than Ebola, BECAUSE it is so quiet and slow.  It has the opportunity to spread to more people because of it's silence.    

So I'd argue that educational quarantine for new infections is of extreme importance.  Not only is the first 5 years of the disease a crucial treatment period and the victim should be educated about that, but we can also teach some much needed knowledge about what practices are safe and which are not in, in regards to transmitting the disease to others.  

Thus, we can help negate some of the exposure to the disease that this virus has gained through ignorance coupled with it's stealthy nature.   

Ebola is the crazy loud shooting spree type killer whilst AIDs is the quiet serial killer.

 Fucking awesome this second link.   I can just make my own and not even have to purchase the erasers.  I'm sure I can tweak the recipe for better performance.  I'm very picky about my erasers.  can't be too hard or too soft.  

This means I can buy my daughter a snack to go along with her trips to the Hand On museum.  And I can keep doing as much art as I want.  

I... I didn't get YOU anything.    




 You are proof of my original assertion that people don't have a clue what quarantine means or how it helps people.  Too bad ignorance is not something we can quarantine for...but I guess ignorance is just the quarantine of your mind from reality.  SO....  

Good luck to you, friend.   




 meh... Cuba isn't half as bad as china.   China really does suck.   Ive been living in asia for over a year.  China does a lot of shit that never makes the news in the usa it seems.    

China sucks, fuck china. 




 After finding out such emotional news, I'd certainly want to be more grounded in science and logic.  That could be soothing to the fear, to be able to hear the science behind it, the treatment, to hear that death is not necessarily knocking on the door.   

What such a life changing event needs is rational objectivity.  Not more drama.   




 Until you realized clenching caused the cuts to bleed, soothing the pain and enabling you to continue angrily clenching your fists until blood drips from them. 




 Which blood would help to soothe. 

I always squeeze my papercuts until they bleed.  Then there is no pain and I don't get the ridiculous talking mouth on fingertip problem.    




 The quarantine might actually benefit the patient.   When Americans hear the word "quarantine" it seems like they think of E.T. and Outbreak... and all the zombie movies.   

But "quarantine" doesn't automatically mean the patient gets shipped off to brutal torture institutes.  

And the first 3 or 4 weeks of being diagnosed you're not gonna want to be sitting around your mother nagging over "You shoulda used a condom... how many times did I tell you to use clean needles.... if you weren't having butt sex this wouldn't happen... blah blah blah"    




 I've tried that before.  The clumps always just fall out of it eventually.  I haven't had a lot of luck.   I also don't like those soft "ticky-tack" erasers for graphite because they don't perform the same each time and end up laying down more mark than they lift off.    




 I do a ton of art, mostly charcoal but I do a ton of sketch work, with graphite, before going to charcoal.  

This is where I work out mistakes...  and I'm not a very good artist so I have to fix, and fix, and fix, until it's right.   I don't just draw it all expert like as I see on Youtube.   

So that leaves me with all these bits and chunks of erasers, that are each too small to use individually, but when piled together would make a very large eraser.   

I store them in a small paint can that I dump out when it gets full.  


How do I stick these guys together?   Can they be melted and remolded?  If I can reclaim these erasers, I'll save at least $14.75 a month; which means I'll have enough to take my daughter to her favorite Hands-on Museum each weekend.   




 seems dumb, to administer a medication to people, without even doing a physical first; let alone consult with a doctor at all.

Yes....  I'm saying the farmers are collecting WAY MORE than 23 gallons per cow.   They've got hundreds or thousands of gallons that evaporate each day in their pointless retention ponds that sit out in the sun all day.  I've driven by to see them keep the retention ponds full in bare fields they aren't using for cattle at the time.  

At least if the cow drank it or it was used to grow alfalfa then it was USED for SOMETHING.    


Just leaving it to evaporate out of some hole in the desert means the water was lost for NOTHING.     




 The word should have been caucus but... autoincorrect.   

Should have read "As a VP she is useless to our caucus."   




 Right.  We need a revolution at the polls.  90% turnout or this isn't going to work.   And even then it will be hard.   Some districts don't even field two candidates because the new gerrymandered district is nearly 100% one party.   So they get seats no matter what happens at the polls.   

At least we could hope for super majorities.    




 I actually, on several posts, already made the point that one should not see the reboot if they are the purist mentality.  

I simply conveyed The Purist's way of thinking.  At no point did I endorse or condone it.

 When I was a kid, we had a Shih Tzu, named Ting Su (racist?) that used to hunt down chocolate.  She'd never touch any food within reach, but leave a Hershey kiss within reach and it was gone; it's existence to be memorialized as shredded bits of foil in the grass.

One Christmas, we were unaware that she had consumed a family sized bag of holiday mint M Ms.  

Ting Su knew the candies were hidden inside the wrapped gift the moment my grandmothers bulging knuckled hands placed it upon the carpet of needles beneath the dry as fuck Christmas tree.  Those acidic smelling needles, that would take weeks of vacuuming to remove, did nothing to hide the existence of those sweet smelling chocolates.  Ting Su's nose was ninja.  A ninja with a stupid cloth antler collar on.   

She waited until everyone left.  She knew what she was doing was wrong.  And she knew we would find her mess upon our return.   She carefully picked up the gift, as if it were one of the many puppies of the numerous litters she raised.  She quickly skulked down the hallway to the last door on the right.  She quickly ducked underneath the bed; where she would be hidden by the flowery bed-skirt and boulders of dust bunnies.  Her sharp teeth make quick work of all impeding packaging and she was rewarded with her 16 oz prize.  

She played it cool upon our return.  No one knew of her misdeeds.   She was a "good girl," "a pretty dog," and strange sounds whilst human places mouth on top of head. 

For me, nothing seemed amiss.  She laid her head gently in my small lap.  I really wasn't prepared for the traumatic event that was about to occur. I pulled her limp head up so I could see into her dark black eyes.  Those ebony globes ordinarily full of love had a different quality to them.  

I moved in closer for a better look and then it happened.   Her body made a jerk.  A huge lurching occurred.  And time then became so very slow.  There was little I could do as I saw it coming.  Bathed in the warm light of the christmas lights, who's setting was not permitted to be changed from "slow glow", I saw the shimmering splash of red, green, white, and mostly brown geyser forth out of Ting Su.   The entire mass of liquid reflected the joyful decorations of the season as it moved ever closer to the center of my face.  

And that's it.  She just wagged her tail and played with her toys for the rest of the evening.   Every year people give me those damn M Ms as a gag gift.   I can't even smell them.  YUCK.  


She didn't die from chocolate. She lived to be 19 years old. She passed in her sleep a few weeks after her daughter died of old age.

When I was in Iraq, I'd visit those memories before falling to sleep.  If only to dream of those places rather than the deadly hell I was in at the time.   

That being said... if someone is a purist about recalling a movie... they just shouldn't see a reboot.   

however, I don't think the conclusion is: your childhood memories aren't that important.   

it's those memories and experiences that make each of us who we are.   So Yeah... seems like thats pretty important.    




 To be fair... I don't prepare my food in the bottom of a dirty sink.  


Nor do I leave the sink all filthy and nasty after washing the cat there.  

Cleaning is possible.  We've got lots of tools to help us with that.   




 How exactly is a rainbow made?    




 Yes. I bathe them in the sink because it's easier and safer than the bathtub.   You see that you quoted me saying I bathe them there?   




 Right because people still care about how much their gas bill is going to be.....  




 Evil cosmetic companies testing their product on helpless animals... 




 Thin Mints are messy as fuck in Iraq. 




 Why?  I've had lots of cats and have trained them all to stay off the kitchen counters and kitchen table.   

It's not hard.  It takes like 3-7 days of conditioning and then it's fine.   

The trick is to make sure they have a high place they are allowed to jump on that belongs to them.  That makes the other training go a lot smoother.   

I don't even feed the cat in the kitchen or open it's food there.   They have their own spot and I keep their food stored near by. 

Another mistake people make is storing the litter box in the laundry room or pantry in their kitchen.   BIG NO NO.   Then they wonder why their cat pisses on clean laundry.   BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE THE PLACE THEY ASSOCIATE WITH PISSING!  Derps.  

My cats never have a reason to go in the kitchen.  They regard it as the place I force them to get wet when I bath them and thats it.   So they stay away.
