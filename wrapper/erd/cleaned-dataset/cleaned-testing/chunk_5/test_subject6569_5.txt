 For a split second I wondered whether there would be Dobby/Pomfrey slash fiction out there before I realized that of course there is. There must be. 




 I think that would be a good idea. 




 I'm not sure whether /r/lewronggeneration applies to people who actually lived/were old enough to experience the period in question. 




 What does infant mortality rates have to do with anything here?

Well, /u/NewWorldDestroyer alluded to the idea that black people get stuff just for being black and I pointed out that one of the things they get is inferior healthcare. 
 
Also, of course non felons get hired more often than felons, regardless of race.

They actually don't. Excerpt from the abstract of the study: 

"Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. **In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison.**" 




 Thought experiment:

Your brother kills himself. You're grieving for him. A few weeks after his death, out of nowhere, he is being accused of being a terrorist by thousands of self-styled internet detectives. They find his social media and just lambaste it with nasty stuff. They also find your twitter and your mom's facebook and write nasty/threatening messages until the internet detectives realize "whoops, we fucked up, nevermind". 

No harm done?  




 Nope. 

But as Pager Western showed in an extensive study in 2009, black felons were at least as likely, if not more likely, to be hired than white men with the same qualifications who didn't go to prison. [^^Source] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915472/)

Or let's look another fun study that shows that the infant mortality rate of non-hispanic whites is more than double the rate of blacks.[^^source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6205a6.htm)

Wait. Shit. I got mixed up, it's the other way 'round.  




 True! And, as another poster already mentioned, peeing asap helps prevent infection as well! 




 DAE hate circlejerks complaining about circlejerks about how tedious and annoying complaints about how there are double standards vs men labeled as "us guys have it so hard"?

Just copy "circlejerks complaining about" and paste it to the beginning of your reply and we can continue this from now until the last reddit server is shut down.  




 You just don't understand! Being a 17-24 year old white man in one of the richest countries in the world is hard living, man.

EDIT: Sometimes I wish reddit still showed the upvotes/downvotes next to the karma, because this post has been swinging wildly between -10 and +10 for the last hour and I'm curious to see what's going on! 




 That's not how disease transmission works. Not saying that there's a five second rule or anything, but prolonged exposure will makes transmission more likely. 

In contrast, if you start without a condom (don't) and only remember to when you're already inside the other person, it's still a good idea to take a break and put on a condom.

 




  they have more of a platform to say the things they say without punishment

That's not limited to the U.S. 




 Is "Human" another app or are you commenting on the ability of humans to count their own steps? 




 Wanna bet?
