 Ghana, Portugal, and Germany are all tough as hell matchups. You've got to love that rivalry that has developed with Ghana in the last decade though, they just have our number. That June 16th game is a must-see. 




 Another fun fact is that if you freeze frame the kid getting chopped in half in the "Conan the Librarian" scene you can see a hilariously creepy mannequin getting it's head spilt open. [Pause Video at 0:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZHoHaAYHq8) 




 Or how about [this pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW8gH_89-OE) to Alshon; that ball is traveling through the air for more than 60 yds.

  Biggest buncha beauties in the league... How can you not love Crawford!?!? 




 I guess this will have to do now that they've discontinued *Gringo Bites* 




 I think some of the goalies that they lit up would be considered abysmal by Today's standards. So while they were a dynamo, let's look at some of the stats from the eighties with a level head. It was a different game back then.  




 I guess they both were; but the Cincinnati team did have Kunitz, Corey Perry, Bryzgalov, and Bylsma the previous year.   




 AND... Coached by none other than Scotty Bowman! I was only 4 but I vaguely remember my dad getting frustrated that they just owned the Hawks in the Finals. I re-watched that series last summer, and man did they ever dominate.  




 A bit off topic but how about some of these rosters from recent memory in the AHL? 

[Philadelphia Phantoms](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0007932005.html) Patrick Sharp, Mike Richards, Jeff Carter, Umberger, Seidenberg, Pitkanen.

[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0009592005.html) Lupul, Ryan Getzlaf, Chris Kunitz, Penner, Glencross, Coached by Danny Bylsma. 

 




 How about the Oilers!?!?!?!

Sure goalies were crap during their reign, but [take a look at this 1983-84 roster!](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0000411984.html). In addition to GRETZKY (87G and 205 points) their top d-man, Coffey puts up 40G and 126 points! Kurri, Messier, and G.Anderson all with 100 points. Are you kidding me?

 Hjammer really is Slalom Ninjasharks back there. Blocking shots with his throat, what *doesn't* he do. 




 I think the FLYAHS were the only one he got wrong. 









 Right, and I think that Jones did an excellent job explaining this in the link above; my point was not to look at the "white flight" aspect so simply.  




 I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people. 

However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory. 

These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety. 

So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.   




 I'll take it. Just let me pick up one of those vacuums from *Luigi's Mansion.*

 Bickell told his Dad that he was going to score one tonight. Keep an eye out for a mean wrister. 




 I found myself in a similar situation recently. I actually needed to move 700 miles back home due to the declining health of my future mother in law. I was as professional and honest as I could have been, and my administrators took note. I also offered my help in finding a highly qualified replacement candidate. 

I gave them a clear picture that this decision was based on my commitment to family. It was by no means an easy decision for me and I felt sick about it for weeks, but all three administrators showed empathy and professionalism. They have been my biggest advocates for getting back into the classroom. It is hard to feel confident about a decision like this, but as long as they saw your talents and are decent human beings it should not be an inhibitor in your career. 




 Cue the Ryan Miller ready-to-cry face. Should be an intense series, nonetheless.  




 Well, grab a nickel and let's head down to the Soda stand, then.
Kidding. But many Jewel-Osco stores as well as Dominick's (RIP) list "pop" as the first product under the Aisle 11 sign, or whatever happens to be the pop aisle. 




 What do you call 290, 55,   90/94 then? 




 Where homeless people are charging their motorized scooters has always been an enigma shrouded in mystery in my brain. 
 




 El Gallo Bravo on Montrose just west of Clark has some $5 carne asada burritos capable of making your belt buckle burst. Their tacos are also great. 

El Ranchito is just slightly north of here on Clark (near Wilson). Huge menu here with a ton of fresh options. Tamales are good (rojo or verde). Also, barbacoa de chiva is also excellent. It's a huge serving of GOAT. Try it!! 

I also really want to go to Mr. Salsa but haven't yet.

 Great debut by the rookie, Alshon Jeffery!

 Season hasn't even started and I'm already disappointed with the Cubs. 




 I want to see BOLLIG vs Roussel in the third. But God forbid this Frenchie fights anyone his size or bigger. 




 [Yeah, here's an optimistic time estimate](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Central+%26+Lawrence/Loyola+University+Medical+Center,+2160+S+1st+Ave,+Maywood,+IL+60153/@41.9150406,-87.8695621,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x880fcc05594f1e1b:0xbe51b9998c0521c4!2m2!1d-87.767387!2d41.967686!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e350b62d7bc83:0x6037d31b606563d9!2m2!1d-87.834149!2d41.861337)  




 Forest park may be a good option; Oak Park may be stretching this dude's budget thin. Wait until you find out you have to pay a decent chunk of change to park your car on Oak Park streets past 11pm 




 So, I'm going to recommend that you look at Elmwood Park or River Grove. I take it that your schedule doesn't allow you to use public transit. These towns are outside the city of Chicago, but if it is crucial that you are able to be in Maywood in 20 mins notice then you could be in Maywood in that time window. 

I'm not sure what your definition of "ghetto" is, so I'm steering you clear of the west side and Maywood. I grew up in Melrose Park and most people in the neighborhood talked about Maywood as if it were a lawless hellhole (although it is right next door and not too different than Melrose Park)

Elmwood Park/ River Grove are neighbors to the city, and if your planning to access the city by car it won't take too long. However, if you insist on living in the city of Chicago, then look at Jefferson Park or Old Irving Park. (With traffic do not assume that Maywood would be 20 mins away at any given time... or ever really)   




 Did Emerick say that Svengoolie has been showing "kiddie films" on Chicago TV for 44 years? Where the hell does he get these facts from?
 




 Just make a trip out to Elmwood Park and eat at Johnnie's. Best 'Talian beast around. 




 Probably [this!!](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YVCsoRpcLRs) 




 Hopefully much higher, given that he's stepping into a much more talent-rich system here. 




 Hoping we take the time to get him acquainted with the North American game, even if it means spending a year in Rockford. Before Tony Salmelainen came to the Hawks he was absolutely scoring at will in Finland. However, he wasn't able to do much here. we have the depth now to take the time for a speedy Fin to get immersed in North American hockey. 




 Wondering if the Buick score is skewed by the demographic owning most of them; perhaps they are "reliable" since they barely get driven. 




 Huh. The Blue Jackets leave the division, and now I actually miss them... Waddya know?

 Ha. I still have my framed picture of the 95-96 Blackhawks + a picture of Cam Russell that I won at a raffle at my library. I'm pretty sure that my name was the only one in the Hawks box then. The Bulls one was overflowing.

 Look at the North or West areas of Alexandria. It's moderately expensive but Arlington in sky high. 




 When my fiancee and I lived in the DC metro we had a combined income of 90k and we still couldn't justify living in Arlington. We ended up on the West end of Alexandria for significantly cheaper. About 10 mins from Arlington and about 30 from Capitol Hill. 1 Bedroom apts. in Arlington are about $1700; it's pretty unjustifiable. I'm getting way more for my money in Chicago; however the job market in the DC metro area is great. 

I'd say focus on work first, get that promotion, and then live in Arlington. NoVA is pretty damn expensive.    




 Your not selling the poor aspect anymore. 




 You never saw the episode with Nosferatu, saw it when I was four and I've never been more paralyzed by fear. 




 or just taking manorexia to a new level 




 The length of the North American season   playoffs and travel factors do not make it feasible for NHL teams to be participants. However, it's not necessarily elitist to say that the North American teams would add a highly co mpetitive element to the league. Not to undermine European hockey, but it would be an awesome showcase to see vastly different styles of play go head to head. 




 Perhaps it is a step in the right direction, but the Model E is not going to be a "mass market" car like some are saying. It's projected to cost Tesla $48,000 to make one, so those figures of it being under $40,000 are not going to come to fruition. 

I remember before the Model S hit the showroom, there was a Tesla display at the mall. The guys from Tesla were showing off the Model S as a concept and saying "It will be available for under $50,000." We know how that turned out. 




 Are we considering the $40,000 concept vehicle a "mass market" vehicle. Sure, long term ownership will save many people a significant amount of money in fuel costs, but damn, that is a lot of money to fork over.
 




 It does depend where you live.
