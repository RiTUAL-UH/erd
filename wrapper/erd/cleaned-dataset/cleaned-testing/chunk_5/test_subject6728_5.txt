 how would you make Stormbringer in shadowrun?





Stormbringer is the name of the infamous black sword featured in a number of fantasy stories by the author Michael Moorcock. Created by the forces of Chaos, it is described as a huge, black sword covered with strange runes carved deep into its blade.

This powerful enchanted black blade is a member of a demon race that takes on the form of a sword, and as such is an agent of Chaos. Stormbringer's edge is capable of cutting through virtually any material not protected by potent sorcery, and it can drink the soul from (and thereby kill) an unprotected human upon delivering any wound, even a scratch. Its most distinctive features are that it has a mind and will of its own, and that it feeds upon the souls of those it kills. 




 I suggest posting some examples. 




 fantasy,science-fantasy etc gibe plz.

post a short description of supposed appearance, behavior,etc. 




 I never played it but i very much enjoy games who emphazise roleplaying and while i know the base setting dosen't have magic. there was a supplement with more setting and did that add the possibility of magic to the game?

how does it work?
alternativly if not how would magic be implemented?

 To me the game scream freeform-magic system how would you make  it work? 




 how often does it happen to you?

i did it all the time worst was with gurps and nwod i just freeze when i have to come up with stuff on the spot ,encounters are by far the worst experiences i had, maybe i'm just not made for GMming

 stating up stuff just stops the game and the players just stare and that's when the doodoo hits the fan in a panic i just blurr out something stupid and try to go around the issue in the stupidest ways as in nwod i just rolled for health and hit die for combat.
or had to bail them out because i threw a monster too strong that they couldn't handle i guess in that aspect it's their fault aswell for not trying to go beyong i have stick and want kill dragon hit dragon with stick until dead. 




 lol yeah could've said a little more than that. 




 what were your experiences with it, how fast does it play and how fast is it easy to come up with stuff on the spot such as stating enemies and stuff. 




 Nobilis
chuck the "estates" away if nevessary. 




 my main worry is that the characters will feel very much the same power wise by having the same abilities and such,Nobilis each character had a diferent Estate and that helped keep them apart, amber only had Pattern,Logrus,Shape-shifting (which seems very underpowered),Trump and Magic(all three) which sounds like the players would know what to expect.
