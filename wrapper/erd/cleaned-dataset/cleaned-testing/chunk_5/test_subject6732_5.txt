 [This](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-dream-within-a-dream/) is where it came from. The full poem. 




 She always put that sentence on the letters that she wrote to him in his teenage and youth. 




  "They told me I could be anything when I grew up. And when I did, I became none of them."

I guess something like this one is from Chris Gardner, *The Pursuit of Happiness* : *There was a time in my life when I could become anything I wanted, and one by one I became none of them.*

Oh Shit.. this quote suits me so well right now.. 




 Harry Potter covers always rock!!! 




 Time Keeper is a really nice book.... and Tuesdays With Morrie is awesome.. 




 "All that you see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream." -Edgar Allan Poe 




 "I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours." -Henry David Thoreau, Walden 




 I love this kind of posts.. thank you so much OP. 




 looks like i got a new book to read.. thanks 




 cool advice.. 




 Goddamnit Alan.. you're something. 




 it doesn't.. i was just kidding when I asked that...  




 I like your creative thinking! 




 you should leave out your magnifying glass!! although good correlation 




 and who said that?? 









 Also, can you please help me clarify a small doubt?? In [Desnity Plots](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html) what are *xfit* and *yfit*??

Sorry if my question seems stupid.. I'm pretty beginner at R and stats..
 




 It worked used read.csv("filename", sep=";")

str() now returns 17 variables. Thank you so much..
 




 I'm working on [this banking public dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#) but when I imported the csv files into R and did a str() operation, it's saying that it has only one variable: 'age' while there are supposed to be other 19 attributes as mentioned in the website [link's *Attribute Information*.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#)

I need to make a presentation of Descriptive Statistics on this dataset and now I'm unable to figure out where the other 19 variables have gone.. Plz see if you too face the same problem. (If so then this is an error in the dataset itself, right??)


 




 FUCKING.NAILED.IT.PERIOD 




  I had 5,000 books (which I lost in a divorce)

How would anybody lose books in a divorce?? 




 *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau is my all time favourite book written by a non-writer. Thoreau is primarily an environmentalist who wrote out of passion for his work towards Nature than wih an actual drive to *write* something, the kind of drive that actual writers have.

What are your favourite books written by those who do not primarily *write books*? 









 sorta like the Zen stuff..cool. 




 He's just fucking with us... 




 Awesome collection... Thank you so much for the post!! 




 Roger that, captain :( 









 quote's awesome... but the background didn't suit... by the way, why the insect?? 




 I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE IN THE COMMENT.... 




 YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.. OUR BROTHERHOOD SHOULD BE BIGGER. 




 YES.. THAT'S A GODDAMN GREAT WAY TO LOOK AT IT..  




 WELCOME TO THE PARTY, BROTHER. 




 Thanks to [Philip K Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick), the author of the film's short story... the same guy who wrote *Blade Runner* book and *Minority Report* short story as well. He's one of the biggest dudes in science fiction... 




  But I've never read a book in it's entirety.

I wonder what you have been writing all along without reading a single book... ( no offence, for every writer reading is the fuel that takes him/her ahead..) 




 says a lot... 




 * Fight Club
* Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
* Edge of Tomorrow
* Predestination
* [1 - Nenokkadine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375559/) (Telugu language)
* Unknown (Liam Neeson's)
* Inception
* The Truman Show
* Interstellar
* The Adjustment Bureau
* The Social Network (awesome screenplay)
* Doodlebug (short film by Chris Nolan)
* Following (Chris Nolan's first film)
* A Beautiful Mind
* The Butterfly Effect (Part 1)
* The Sixth Sense

and 

* Shutter Island

 




 *The Social Network* - the dialogues of the film always motivate me! They're so brilliantly written that I made a scene from it (*"Did I adequately answer your condescending question?"* scene) as my mobile ringtone!

*"It's raining."*

*"I'm sorry"*

*"It just started raining."*

I saw something illuminating in those lines and that's it my life was changed. 




 [*The Words*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1840417/) is a really fine movie about a struggling *writer*... I wonder why nobody mentioned it yet.. The moral crossroads that he reaches when he realizes that his truth is found out by that person left me with a haunting feel. 




 But in one of my experiences.. I had long time back browsed for movies *about* writing and picked up *Barton Fink* and *Adaptation* - and hated both. 




 *Inception* - never before watching this film did I take the concept of dreams seriously, but with this film, the horizons of human imagination have surely been extended for me. 
  

*Interstellar* - watching how the grandeur of the plot twist unfolds by the end of the film really made me think of creating such magnificent science fiction.. and that docking scene... OH GOD!! Fantastic.. 




 Hey awesome post!!! Thanks... 




  Others I might suggest are Into the Wild or The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. They're both more about escaping back to the wilderness, but both succeed really in motivating you to just go out and do something.

Yeah.. Second that! And also both have awesome OSTs.. they motivate me write.. and roam around in the out. 




 I fell in love with her in my teenage after watching Pans Labyrinth. 




 that's true...!! thanks for the response.. 









 From the titles you've mentioned above, I have already read *Into The Wild* and *Walden* - both had been powerful life changers... :) 




 *Into The Wild* has changed away my beliefs on individuality, passion, firmness in belief and all that stuff.. and then from this same book came another, one of the most vital books I ever read in my life, **Walden** by Henry David Thoreau - it showed an all new perspective of Nature, our place in it, and our arrogantly assumed ownership of the world...!! 

*Walden* is so fucking powerful that at some point it ceases to be a book and starts acting a missile inside your mind. 




 yeah, big deal.. Thanks for the name.. will check out what this book is about :) 




 *As a Man Thinketh* is one of the best jewels I ever picked up in my life... The content is pure soulful awesomeness.. 




 thank you so much for the detailed info... will pick this goddamn book for sure after listening about it so much from you guys :) 




 I love Sorkin's each and every dialogue from *The Social Network*! 
Especially, that *Did I adequately answer your condescending question?* scene... I've never seen such a scene before. 




 When it comes to non-fiction by Isaac Asimov, I prefer long works.. the longer the better.. I mean, it's like sitting and listening to one of the greatest minds of Mankind.. So, I dare not limit it to 200 pages! 




 Oh brother.... I adore Joseph Campbell's works... that PBS TV series **The Power of Myth** has opened me up to an all new perception of what is called a *mythology.* 




 Hey.. thanks a lot pal for taking the time to give such a response... helped me and others to know of more books.. thank you so much. 




 On the day I came to know that *Moneyball* is actually a book (I saw the movie first because the film version is written by Aaron Sorkin, my fav screenwriter), written by Michael Lewis, I immediately put it into my must-read list.  




 I need this! That being said, now you already know I'm thankful to you. 




 I read a similar nonfiction/selfhelp book last year.. *Flipside* by Adam J. Jackson.. Its about the hidden opportunities on the other side of the problems we face in life.. It has since then been in my 5 star book-list... I absolutely loved it.. it's a real life changer in a way.. 




  by Asimov

enough said... :D 




 I guess I need these... thanks a ton! 




 yaa.. i share a similar feeling about Freakonomics.. the other day I started the audio book and really couldn't feel interested in what is being read there... so.. i let it alone.. but Michael Lewis' *Next* was awesome.. 




 Loved his Animal Farm.. but 1984 not so much... let me see into this one...  Thank u so much for the response.. 




 this Einstein guy is really cool!! thanks.. 




 sounds interesting... thanks for putting it up.. 




 thanks a lot.. shall try picking it for sure... and also can you plz mention the name of the author.. there are many Hiroshima books out there.. so.. 




 liked the ending.... and I would like to believe in this quote, looking at how ambitions in my life are going right now. So, yeah I needed to hear this. Thanks to you and that friend of yours.. 




 Hello dear fellow Indian..this poster is kick-ass!!! Phaad diya bhai tune toh... (mera hindi itna acha nahi hai, so please don't mind) 




 I've seen non-fiction books being usually long.. But I love short non-fiction books too. Helps me absorb deep knowledge from short number of pages quickly.

My favourite short non-fiction works are:

*  *Words From The Myths* by Isaac Asimov (pagecount: around 130 pages - contains interesting Greek and Roman mythological tales behind the origin of some of the most used words in English language) (i love this book  more for the mythical stories it told than for its theme).
* *Nationalism* by Rabindranath Tagore (pagecount: around 100 pages - contains Tagore's views on what differs a Country from a Nation)

Do you have any favourite short non-fictional works? Would love to hear about them.. please share the titles and your experiences with them here.

Thanks. 




 this quote is very negative... unfortunately. 




 Grimm's Fairy Tales - Brothers Grimm 




 Special contribution award of sheer awesomeness goes to NettleStorm25 of Slytherin House!! 




 It should be so.. because there is something called as *improvement..* which every writer, rather every artist needs infront of him.. 









 That's a great thing really... you're way ahead of those people who are not doing as good as you.. All the best.. Do wonders with your stories. 




 awesome!!!! 




 Which ones did you buy?? Can you plz name them.. would like to know, just out of curiosity. 




 **The Martian** by Andy Weir 




 Well, this is the real dystopian. 




 Wow.. this post is fucking awesome... Thanks for coming up with this! 




 Siddhartha is truly very good.. and another one by Herman Hesse, Steppenwolf is awesome book... If you liked Siddhartha, then Steppenwolf is a must try. 




 *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau. This book depicts the beauty of world's nature and our position in it almost like no other literary work, may be except for the essay called *Nature* by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau's guru. 




 Hey thank you so much... 




 It's just a link to my blog.. anyways I removed the URL.. so I guess we're cool there! 




 It's a big relief that this isn't Harry... No glasses, see. 




 I like reading very much. It shaped my life.. Basically I love words and I also write.. Recently I started writing short pieces .. So to explore more of this ground, I'm looking for some books that are filled with short stuff.

Please suggest me books that have:

* Splendidnly well weaved words.. like some very short poetry.. something like Gitanjali.. (I have long poetry books already.. now I'm looking for something like one page long at max)
* Beautiful short musings
* Anything well written that's longer than quotes but shorter than stories, like a couple of pages..
* Short myths kind of stuff may be (short)


Sorry, I'm unable to articulate properly what I want, but I guess you get the idea... 

Please suggest lots and lots of works.. (actually I'm an aspiring writer.. So, I'm exploring the beauty of words to fill my mind with it. That being said, if possible, put a note called "extra-works" and suggest whatever other works you think would be helpful for me to chisel myself into a better weaver of words..) 

**Sorry if I'm asking too much of your time and effort with all this... but please help me. Thank you so much.** 




  In one way of the other we're all ugly. 

Please note that I said: **everybody** and also that *ugly hat* is a personification of our various character traits.. 

 




 Or maybe he's just teaching his son to respect other people's ugliness too; a character trait we all possess in this modern world. In one way of the other we're all ugly. 

I guess that hat is a personification of people's inner self and we all need to love one another despite our ugl.... OKAY!!! this is going nowhere.. I'll just shut up! 




 deep shit. no kidding 




 He's a true friend... One of the most memorable moments for me in the entire book series is in the 7th book when Ron leaves Harry and goes away from the forest.. and then after a period of time when he comes back.. 

*Ron says: "Dumbledore always knew I was going to leave you, that's why he gave me that Deluminator."*

*"No. He always knew you would want to come back," Harry corrects him.*

That is the most epic moment for me in the friendship of Harry and Ron. I was very very disappointed when this scene is completely left out in the film. 

 




 I guess you mentioned you work on web technologies.. Holding an academic degree in Literature, how/why did you land up in tech arena? Just asking! 




 oh a degree in literature... that's so cool.. thanks. will surely keep in touch.. 




 GREAT FUCKING THINGS ARE NEVER EASY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE. WHEN WAS THERE A GODDAMN EASY THING THAT YOU FELT BRAINFUCKING PROUD OF YOURSELF JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT, A THING THAT NOT MANY OUT THERE HAVE DONE TOO? 

THERE WONT BE ANY. BECAUSE EASY THINGS ARE FUCKING DONE BY EVERY MOTHERFUCKER OUT THERE. SO WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM THAT HENPECKING CROWD? **DISCOMFORT.**

THAT'S RIGHT. DISCOMFORT IS SEEN BY MANY AS AN UNTOUCHABLE. NOBODY WANTS IT. DISFUCKINGCOMFORT IS AN OUTCAST.. BUT HEY THERE IS SOMETHING WE'RE PHENOMENALLY MISSING TO SEE HERE. DISCOMFORT IS LIKE THE DANGEROUS BRIDGE THAT CAN LAND YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.. IN FRONT OF THAT CAVE OF TREASURE AND MAGIC THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FUCKING DESIRED FOR. 

OFCOURSE THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO STAY ON THE BRIDGE ITSELF ALL OUR LIVES, BUT TO FUCKING REACH THE OTHER SIDE.. YOU SHOULD NOT LIVE IN DISCOMFORT FOREVER, BUT YOU GOTTA FUCKING USE IT TO MAKE THAT LEAP FORWARD IN YOUR GODDAMN LIFE.. 

AND THE PROPORTION OF DISCOMFORT THAT CAN REALLY TAKE YOU THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN LIFE IS OF ASTRONOMICAL PROPORTIONS. YOU DO THAT ONLY THROUGH ADDICTION. GET BITCHLICKING ADDICTED TO DISCOMFORT - TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE FUCKING DOING, THAT NOBODY FUCKING FEELS LIKE DOING.. 

THAT, MY BROTHERS, IS THE WAY TO GREAT THINGS... 

*WELL WOVEN PATHS CAN NEVER PROVIDE THE ADVENTURE LIKE FORESTS DO..*

**THINK ABOUT IT. DO THE DISCOMFORT.**



 




 I'm looking into different ways of storytelling... so ya that's about it.. mostly stories.. that's my art.. I'm not at all figure drawing guy. 




 Hi.. that mod reference to "there was another user who is a writer" was about me. I recently made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtBuddy/comments/2xw4y3/im_an_aspiring_writer_im_looking_for_a_buddy_to/) post regarding me wanting somebody to draw art for my writings.. So, I'm a writer guy.. a storyteller (just starting out on taking that up seriously, although as a hobby).

Your project sounds really cool and I would like to really try my hand at something like this.. (can't promise anything as this is absolutely new to me. Never worked on anything related to comics at all.. but want to give it a shot..) 

And also, I too prefer a leisurely pace, because I have a day job and commitments to lot of other creative stuff..
I'm from India, by the way! 




 Yeah like many comments said.. the idea is good.. but the execution of course matters... And also that human relations thing is true to its core.. I mean, look at **Interstellar** film.. it wouldn't have been what it is if the humanitarian aspects are not embellished into the plot.. look at that Docking Scene.. You want to save a planet full of people, and live for the your loved ones.. else you would just listen to the robot and not try anything, right! 




 Oh sure.. Please do. Not a problem :) 




 Hey, like I said your art work was fantastic.. so I felt like writing about it.. I just tried writing about that second picture of the Eye (image number #9 in the URL). So, this is like 'WriteBuddy' kind of stuff maybe.. [Here's the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBB-Leq0NlOdSx-UZgAI4Fz6NfOoZZxwX03xLmWAe38/edit?usp=sharing) to the text, please see.. (Sorry if it doesn't come anywhere near to what was on your mind when you created the artwork. That was just my interpretation anyway)

Thank you so much.. 

I would like to hear from you :) 




 Thank you very much for the response. I left you a message. Please check it out..   




 Oh thanks a lot, buddy.. Please do.. I will be immensely excited and happy to see my writings in drawing by somebody. Thank you so much. When you draw it and if there are any clear details that you would want to know regarding any of those writings, please let me know. I will give out a clear detail.. or you can please just give out your own interpretations.. anything is fine. Thanks once again! 




 I loved the film's [OSTs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/secret-life-walter-mitty-music/id776155469)
But today when I was browsing through something another [OST album of the same film](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/secret-life-walter-mitty-original/id768262442) appeared. 

Now I'm pretty confused... Which one should be the correct one and why are there two OST albums for the same film?? 




 Hey a really big thanks for the kind of response you gave.. I will look through the suggestions and posts that you mentioned about... I really liked the idea of ArtBuddy and so I would try my best take help from people here. Fingers crossed!

Thanks :) 




 I mostly like writing fantastical or mind-bending related stuff, like Telepathy, Teleportation, Time Travel, Supernatural elements, Space, Cosmos and etc. I'm kindof starting out on them. Mostly short stories, short random writings and musings. You can take a look at some short stuff that I [wrote recently - ](https://medium.com/word-dust) especially the post titled ["On Looking at the Stars"](https://medium.com/word-dust/on-looking-at-the-stars-56ed4647d431)

I try to be imaginative in my writings and recently I felt like seeing my writings with illustrations, but I'm no good at drawing related activities. 

So, I'm looking for an ArtBuddy who can do that for me for fun (I can't pay any money, sorry about that.. I don't write to make money either, not yet)

**EDIT: (typo in the post title) "WHO can draw my writings"** 




 Deep! 




 Thank you :) 




 That's a pretty good advice.. Thanks a lot :) 
I will find such people who would stand as help for building up my skills. [If you're interested in doing so, plz PM me. It would be a great help, if not, that's ok too.]

Thank you so much for the valuable response and idea. 




 I'm 24, and I want to be a writer. So it is high time that I started practicing to write fiction. I want to do so through writing short stories first. But I'm looking for a good platform to present my stories to people. I'm using Medium for my blogging activities and sometimes Blogger. Blogger used to be my fav years ago, but recently it has turned to s**t.. really disappointed with that. And Medium is pretty good for articles and blogs, but for a long story kind of posts, I don't think it will suit.

So, I'm kind of looking for any suggestions on how to present my short stories to people. My interest is in writing fantasy (not like an epic fantasy, but mostly like Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King, with a touch of decent fantasy and supernatural elements) science-fiction, fairy tales and etc. 

Thanks for the responses in advance. 




 I would like to be friends with you. 




 Because it says things in its metaphysical sense that talks about fighting against the cataclysm that the Mankind was about to face, its doom, and not giving up in the face of it. 

**Do not go gentle into that goodnight** (*don't just give up all hope and die out, which is as easy as going into a good night sleep, only forever*)

**Rage rage, against the dying of the light** (*fight with all your heart, and your soul, and everything that you have, for the light, for a new dawn, for another sunrise, which would be a rebirth to the Mankind*)

That's why it is related to Interstellar. 




 GETTING GOOD AT STUDIES, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE SUBJECTS THAT YOU SUCK, IS THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. I WOULD LOVE SUCH A THING TO HAPPEN TO ME, A DIRECTION IN WHICH I'M TRAVELING THESE DAYS.

KUDOS BROTHER FOR THE KICK-ASS ACHIEVEMENT. 
KEEP ROCKING. 




 WHOLEHEARTED THANKS FOR THAT :) 




 ALL THIS TIME SPENT AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA - WAS ABLE TO DO SOME REAL KICK-ASS THINGS.

ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:

* FINISHED READING FOUR BOOKS
* FOUNDED AN ONLINE MAGAZINE WITH A FRIEND OF MINE (CURRENTLY IN A FACEBOOK PAGE PHASE)
* REALIZED MY WEAK POINTS IN MY EXAM PREPARATION AND ALSO LEARNED THE PROPER WAY TO PRACTICE STUFF FOR IT. 
* FOUND A NEW FAVOURITE AUTHOR: *NEIL GAIMAN*. HE'S FUCKING FANTASTIC AT WHAT HE DOES.
* WROTE SOME FINE STUFF FOR MY BLOG.
* AND STARTED WRITING A FAIRY TALE.. SHALL FINISH IT THIS WEEK.

AND ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THINGS:

I REALIZED THAT I NEED TO IMPROVE MY TIME MANAGEMENT FOR PREPARING AND CRACKING THIS EXAM THING THAT I TOOK UP. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE. I DIDN'T DO THAT WELL IN THE PAST ONE MONTH. SO THAT'S MY CONFESSION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT.

THANKS BROTHERS FOR THE SUPPORT.. 

**I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT ALL THE FUCKING GREAT SHIT (ALSO FUCKEDUP SHIT, IF ANY) THAT YOU DID IN THAT FEBRUARY MONTH.** 




  I WASNT ABOUT TO WIMP OUT IN FRONT OF HER.

THAT'S AWESOME AND PRETTY SMART, BROTHER.. KUDOS TO THAT MIND OF YOURS THAT CAME UP WITH SUCH AN IDEA :) 




 I AM TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA... FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH. I DO THIS WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE MY TIME IS BEING PUT INTO TOO MANY THINGS AT A TIME. LATELY I HAVE OBSERVED THIS WAVE TAKING SHAPE AGAIN IN MY LIFE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS SUB I FUCKING LOVE VISITING HERE. BUT ALONGSIDE THIS I VISIT MANY OTHERS SUBS ON REDDIT. I KIND OF SOMETIMES PUT FUCKING TOO MUCH TIME INTO REDDIT.. DAMN, REDDIT IS ONE OF THE BEST KINDS SOCIAL FUN OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET... ANYWAYS, RIGHT NOW I AM TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM ALL OF THAT SHIT.. REDDIT, FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND ETC..

SHALL READ BOOKS INSTEAD...

CATCH UP WITH YOU ALL NEXT MONTH BROTHERS.. MEANWHILE, CONTINUE TO ROCK YOUR FUCKING LIFE.

PEACE.

KRISHNA KANTH 




 HEY BROTHER.. THANKS A FUCKING LOT FOR POINTING A GOOD PATH. I LIKE PSYCHOLOGY. I FUCKING BELIEVE IN IT. BUT MORE THAN THAT I BELIEVE IN MYSELF. I WILL GIVE ALL THAT I GOT AND THEN SOME MORE FOR THIS FAVOURITE EXAM OF MINE AND WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
 




 A FEW YEARS AGO THERE CAME A TIME IN MY GODDAMN LIFE WHEN I HAD TO ABSOLUTELY REFUCKINGDEFINE IT. IN ALL ASPECTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN EDUCATION. I WAS MOVED TO MY BOWELS WITH THE NEED TO PROVE MYSELF TO THE MOTHERFUCKING WORLD AROUND ME. I WAS ASKED ON MY FACE IF I AM GOING TO BE A LOSER. I HAD TO FUCKING ANSWER THEIR ASSES WITH MY KICKING-ASS ACHIEVEMENTS. AND GUESS WHAT.. I DID. I FUCKING EXCELLED AN EXAM AND GOT INTO ONE OF THE BEST COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY FOR MY MASTERS.

BUT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, NOW AT THIS PHASE OF LIFE (I AM WORKING IN AN MNC, JUST LIKE MANY PEOPLE OF MY COUNTRY DO, I'M FROM INDIA) I FEEL LIKE I HAVE RAN OUT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I ONCE HAD BEEN ONE ABOVE MANY, BUT NOW I'M BEING JUST ONE AMONG ALL. I FUCKING DON'T LIKE THAT. 

**I.FUCKING.DO.NOT.LIKE.THAT!**

THERE HAD BEEN A CHALLENGE THAT I HAD RAN AWAY FROM IN THOSE ACCOMPLISHING YEARS OF MY PAST. IT WAS A NATIONAL EXAM. I BELIEVED THAT I CAN NOT CRACK IT EVER. I FEARED THAT I WILL BE CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ITS CLAWS. I WAS FUCKING AFRAID. SO I LET IT ALONE. BUT SINCE THAT DAY A PART OF MY HEART HAD BEEN HUNGRY AND DISSATISFIED KNOWING THAT I HAD EVADED THAT CHALLENGE. 

BUT GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKERS.. NOW I AM CALLED BACK BY IT. I'VE BEEN SUMMONED BY GOD TO PICK IT FUCKING UP AGAIN NOW AND BEAT IT TO HELL THIS TIME. SO NOW I'VE STARTED PREPARING FOR THAT FUCKING EXAM. TO FUCKING TOP IT.

BUT HERE IS THE DISAPPOINTING PART, BROTHERS. I AM FUCKING ACTING LIKE I FORGOT WHO I WAS. WHEN I SIT IN THE CLASSES FOR THE EXAM PREPARATION, THE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE BEING FUCKING GIANTS IN KNOWLEDGE (ESPECIALLY MATH) THAT I NEED TO POSSESS TOO. I USED TO POSSESS THAT KNOWLEDGE. BUT NOW I FORGOT ALL THAT GLORY.

LAST WEEK MY MIND WAS FUCKED WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND I DIDN'T HAVE A FUCKING CLUE.

**BUT I CAN NOT LEAVE IT AGAIN. I WILL FUCKING NOT. I WILL LOOK THIS CHALLENGE IN THE FACE AND SPIT ON IT. I WILL TIE THIS CHALLENGE TO MY MIND'S BED AND FUCKING RAPE IT EVERY NIGHT. I WILL GRAB MY FEAR OF THIS EXAM BY ITS HAIR AND FEED ITS FUCKING ENTRAILS TO MY SPIRIT-HOUNDS.**

YES I FORGOT MY HISTORY AND PAST GLORY.. NEVERTHELESS, I WILL REWRITE IT WITH THE NEW STORY. 




 ON PATH TO SOME MINDBLOWING GREATNESS IN THIS GODDAMN LIFE, GIVE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU'VE GOT TO IT....**AND THEN SOME MORE!**

THAT IS THE MOST GODDAMN PART: **SOME MORE** 

IT IS WHAT SHOWS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND EVERY OTHER FUCKER PUT TOGETHER. 

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT TURNS 45 MINUTES INTO AN HOUR.

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT CONVERTS PRETTY MUCH TO 'PRECISE'.

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT FINISHES THE RACE.

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT MAKES YOU COMPLETE.

 




 Agatha Christie is an author that I'm yet to try.... Will do it this year.. Thanks 




 thanks....  




 awesome... thanks for the suggestions..  




 There was a Telugu movie I saw a long time ago.. and there is this scene where the heroine goes to an interview and the interviewer, after finishing all his questions, asks her to close her eyes and speak out what all the things she saw in the room from the time she entered. She tells a good detail of things in the room like wall poosters, clocks, or books and especially (here is the kind the books I want to ask for) she tells about the items placed on either sides of his hands on the table and thus deduces that the interviewer is a left handed person. I really liked her observations skills especially of the handedness...

Now, can somebody please suggest me some books where I can learn about such stuff??

Thank you so much. 




 THAT'S A REAL FUCKING ADVICE BROTHER.. THANK YOU. 

YES. I WILL DO WHAT IS UNFUCKINGCOMFORTABLE AND MAKE IT MY FUCKBUDDY.. **I WILL MAKE DISCOMFORT MY CHISEL AND WILL FUCKING SCULPT MY DREAM WITH IT.** 




 (FROM INDIA) VERY UPLIFTING POST, BROTHER. A DAY STARTED WITH READING A BOOK IS ONE OF A KIND I TELL YOU. TO START A DAY THAT WAY WHERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN READ A SINGLE BOOK FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, IS A KICK-ASS KIND OF LIVING. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT I LOVE READING TOO. THAT BEING SAID, NOW REGARDING MY DAILY ROUTINE:

I USED TO MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, BUT THAT ROUTINE DETERIORATED A BIT RECENTLY. I'M TRYING TO GET BACK TO IT. APART FROM THIS, I START MY DAY BY STUDYING FOR A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM THAT I'M PREPARING FOR. I HAVE A DAY JOB AS WELL.

WHEN I START MY DAY WITH SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE IN THE BASKET I FEEL REALLY GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN I MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, THE REST OF THE DAY IS PERSPICUOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER DAY.

FORTUNATELY TODAY I MEDIDATED BEFORE STARTING MY DAY.

APART FROM THAT, I MOSTLY PLAN THE EXAM STUDIES BEFORE I GO TO BED. THIS HELPS ME LAUNCH MYSELF DIRECTLY INTO PRODUCTIVE MODE THE NEXT MORNING RATHER THAN INVESTING TIME IN DECIDING WHAT TO WORK ON.

THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MY PLANS GET DISTURBED.. BUT I'M TRYING TO BRING ORDER TO SUCH CHAOS.
