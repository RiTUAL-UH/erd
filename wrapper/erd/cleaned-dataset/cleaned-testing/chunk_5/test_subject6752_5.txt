 It means Trans Excluding Radical Feminist. I assume you're confused about the meaning. 




 I am a feminist and I did back peddle to explain a mistake I had made, so I suppose so, though this topic has little to do with feminism. Feminists, those who aren't TERFs anyway, do pay attention to trans* rights, but that doesn't make trans* issues only feminine issues. Sort of like, a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't a square. 




 Well, as you can see by my edit, I confused gender identity and gender roles. Gender identity is hardwired by brain "maps" if you will that dictate how the body should be lined up. I'm not really a mechanics type person, but I don't think transmissions have anything to do with biology. 




 Gender roles are a social construct, so in a sense, no it doesn't exist. However, traffic laws are also social constructs and they exist, in a sense. As long as we recognize social constructs, they exist.

Edit: my mistake, confused gender and gender roles.

Edit 2: confused rolls and roles. 




 "Faggot" is actually only used for gay men. There is a separate derogatory term for lesbians.  




 Wow... Usually I check on stuff like that. So much for helping. 




 As a lesbian and a gay rights advocate, it would be quite troubling if I were a homophobe. 




 No, I haven't experienced racism. Though, I am a genderqueer lesbian who presents fairly masculine, so I have experience the bad side of bigotry for being a minority. I wasn't rude to you, I simply explained a conceptual difference. I once made the same mistake myself and the person who explained it to me wasn't so kind, so I thought I'd do it nicely before that person showed up. 




 I'm not denying anything. Also, denying something doesn't make someone a bigot. A Holocaust denier is most likely a bigot, but if they rely just don't believe it happened, they are ignorant, as they ignore facts presented. 




 Yes and no. What you defined is institutionalized racism. A person's remarks can still be racist without real power, though words have power. It's an easy mix up. 




 More homophobia. How attractive! 




 If she were having phone sex, she could get hearing AIDS.

For everyone else who didn't know. 




 Have you ever been asked to sit on a cake? 




 At least they're little. The deer look right at you and it's awful. Also a suspicious amount of cats and dogs and once a guinea pig near me. 




 (No regrets) I dislike the American military greatly. They waste money throwing "freedom" where it isn't wanted. Members are not heroes. Unless you were drafted, you took the job and knew the risks, just as you would to be a teacher or a Wal-Mart cashier. You're free to disagree, but that's my opinion. Though, I have a soft spot for families that are reunited. I don't know if it's the feeling being shared with the people in the video or if it's the fact that I know they don't know If they'll ever see their soldier alive again or what, but I cry every time. 




 "Brothers". 




 I'm an amateur lesbian, not a professional or anything, but if you put a pussy in my pussy I'd probably cry. 




 Yo dawg, we heard you like pussy so we put pussy in your pussy so you can pet your pussy while you pet your pussy. 




 Ignore that. I'm an illiterate asshole. You don't need to apologize for the behavior of others. Keep doing you and making the male population look good! 




 Well, many if not most cishet men are sexist. They also are terribly objectifying. I don't want to deal with either. No, you can't watch, no I'm not thinking about experimenting. 

My best friend is a straight guy, but he's trans and doesn't do that stuff. I have several straight male friends but really I'd rather hang with girls who want to chat and talk girl stuff. Also, there is weird competitive energy between dudes and lesbians. 




 I figured out the problem! You can't read! 

P.s. the kid is a daughter. I bet it matters less now. 




 Talk of rabbit consumption isn't allowed here. 




 I didn't say that OP shouldn't be allowed in the child's life, I said she made a decision for her child.  




 Muh men's rights!!1!!11! 

He was a fifteen year old KID. He was in no position to be a dad or provide for a child. She tried to make the best choice for her kid's life. It wasn't to hurt OP. You guys try to force fifteen year old girls to abort. 




 I seriously doubt she had the means to contact him and ***had not really had a chance to decide what to do when she later ran into him.*** 




 Most likely they didn't exchange last names, numbers, Facebooks or Twitters. 




 First off, warts are hardly life or health threatening. It's not like he hid AIDS from you. 

We don't know if he would have done the same if it were a dangerous STI. We don't have a way to know that. Perhaps you could communicate about it. 

I don't think something like this is worth a break up. You have a right to be upset but I don't think your guy was being malicious at all. I think he was just being stupid and didn't think through the consequences of you getting it, too, since no one else had. 




 He was a 15 year old kid who had met her once. I seriously doubt she had the means to contact him and had not really had a chance to decide what to do when she later ran into him. 




 DD is rarely considered big. It's only 4 inches of boob total, so more like two each. 




 If you can admit you have a problem, get help. You can do it.  




 Check out /r/abrathatfits. It won't help you get a girl but a lot of dudes who need the support are going for bras. Maybe you can make a man bra, call it a "bro" put dragons on it, sell it to other perky breasted men, make the big bucks and get a girl that way. 




 I absolutely love muffin tops. Don't be like the cake boss with a cupcake top all up in there but a cute little muffin top really gets me. I'm totally unattracted to people without it. There is hope for you out there! 




 Wow. That's like outright stating no one poor or disabled can be prom king or queen. 




 At my school, popular kids are always nominated and recognized as such, but the kids who did the most work and were dedicated always got elected. 




 I have a preference (Kotex U super for tampons and Equate overnight ultrathin with wings for pads) but when I'm broke it's not a big deal to get something else. 




 But gay marriage is all about gay men and their scary buttsex. I mean really. They do blowjobs. Beardy blow jobs. And they do rimming. Sexy, bearded rimming. 

/^ homophobic politician thoughts. 




 I'm a fifth generation East Stroudsburg graduate, so I may be a bit biased here, but while Stroudsburg isn't a bad district the way other local ones are, they are going through some bad financial stuff and closing schools. They also have a strict dress code if that matters to you. East Stroudsburg South high is a US News ranked school and the dress code is no jeans or sweats, shirts must be school or college related or collared.  




 I don't know... It sticks our from the body, maybe it could get cold like hands and feet often do. 




 What if it's on your mons? 




 The only song post Folie a Deux is Young Volcanos and it doesn't even sound like them. 




 Since gay marriage devalues marriage, more women will be unmarried. Unmarried women have more abortions than married women. 

Though, you actually have to buy into the idea that same sex marriage devalues marriage as a whole. Makes sense, huh? 




 Oh god that sounds awful lol. I prefer glass and the harder the better so that sounds boring and I also like cold toys, not warm. 




 The goal isn't to orgasm as quickly as possible. The goal is to have fun.

Especially true on the bus. 




 Not a virgin but a lesbian; how does dick feel compared to dildos? 




 Go for stroudsburg or east stroudsburg. Better schools and civilization. They call pleasant valley high school pregnant valley for a reason. West is outright ghetto and Pocono mountain east is just high class ghetto.  




 /r/randomactsofpizza /r/assistance should be able to hook you up with some food. 




 Protip: cut onions in the kitchen, not on the Reddit. 




 From experience, marriage doesn't fix the problem. You have to know that it's not going to get better just because you said "I do." Work on your relationship. If you love her, it's worth fixing. Don't be afraid to try counselling.  




 I don't know if you guys are at a level for marriage talk, but something that has helped open My wife's eyes is to point out that, in wedding vows, you say "to have and to hold" which means "I promise you sex and cuddles". I give her as much of the hold part as she wants, so she needs to do some of the have part. 

Also, you need to find out why she hates going down on you. If it's uncomfortable, consider getting throat numbing spray. If it's a trigger to a past abuse, find out how to get around that trigger. It's her fault she isn't keeping up her end of the relationship, but it's a partnership and if you help her it'll be easier. 

I know you aren't quite to that point yet, but check out /r/deadbedrooms. It helped me a lot in figuring out how to deal with this. Some people there like myself are trying to prevent a dead bedroom, others have been in one for ten or more years. 

I wish you luck in talking to your girlfriend and don't ever feel guilty for wanting to have sex with her. You love her and that's a great way to show it, but also don't intentionally make her feel guilty for not wanting to, it's her body and she gets to make the decisions on what she does with it. 




 We communicate on it regularly. She has extremely low libido and doesn't like to be pressured at all. We have talked outside the bedroom about the issue and I have given up on trying to initiate. When I do, she cries and then I have to comfort her and then we go to sleep. I love her, don't get me wrong, but if I had known this would happen at 6 months in, I would have either addressed the issue or gotten out. 




 I'm not trying to judge you, but you said that in two other relationships you miscarried. That means this is the third relationship you are trying to have a baby in. You referred to your SO as your girlfriend, not wife or partner or fiance. Before you do this, please make sure you are certain about this relationship. Its not fair to the kid If you aren't. 




 Been with my wife 4.5 years, married 4.5 months. In my experience, it won't change. I love going down on her but she does it for me maybe half as much and almost never gets me off that way. Before we got married, we had sex about twice a week, sometimes more, and after we got married, we had sex like 15 times the first week and now we haven't had sex in two and a half weeks. Prior to this it was about every other week but apparently is become even less often. 




 What I'm saying is that you can still get pregnant from anal. It does mean condoms if you don't want babies. 




 Everything is really close and drippy.  




 My wife and I are married. We both are working on getting our degrees. She works full time and I'm taking time off to cope with my depression. I graduated high school a year early. I worked for a year and a half as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. I take care of my physically disabled mother. 

Four days ago, my wife's sister had a son. She is 19, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, has no life plans and has cut the baby's father out of his child's life. She lives with her father because he will pay for everything since it's a boy. 

I want a baby more than anything. So does my wife. We don't get to have one because we aren't "stable" enough but this stupid kid and plenty of other stupid kids do. Its bullshit. 




 But it should be. Where my SimCity3000 Unlimited trolls at?!


 




 More so having the wrong kind if friends. 




 If you rented the place with a washer and it no longer has one, you pay less in rent. Call the landlord and find out if he agrees that 50 or 100 a month less is fair. The washer will be replaced by Tuesday. 




 I don't think time travel is possible. If it were, the technology would have always existed, as it would have been brought back. 




 I've tried to look at stuff about quantum physics and string theory and whatnot and it all gets mixed up in my head and I have to read it at like a first grade level. I'm not really good at science type stuff. 




 Oh my god, nobody here is being racist you stupid nigger. 

Gilded. 

 




 This is a part of it, too!  




 Not sure if human or robot... 




 Talk about a baby boom. 




 Maybe in Finland shelters only have mutts but plenty of American shelters have more pure bred dogs. The three shelters nearest me have about 80% pit bulls, 10% other pure and 10% mutts. If your theory were true, fewer shelters would be needed because more people would want the mutts.  




 Most divorces are not first marriages. Your stat on women initiating makes me think you have personal trust issues. I hope you can sort it out.  




 One generation of inbreeding does not equal many generations of inbreeding. Most people also don't just pick up a mutt from a random farm.  




 I take some comfort in "knowing" that somewhere, sometime, I'm still with My grandmother. I also think that everything happens simultaneously and repeats simultaneously. 




 I'm assuming that your concern with fairness is same sex marriage. I'm a married gay person, in part because my wife's family wouldn't let me see her or make decisions if she were hospitalized. Consider that if your girlfriend is your son's other "parent", marriage may help in a lot of ways legally. Just make sure your protect your family. 




 Lol totes fuck poor people! 




 Nope but plenty of racism from you. 




 I know you tagged /s but there are a lot of reasons this is an awful idea. 

For one, I know I have gotten up to get a drink and left my player fishing or whatever. Secondly, I like to play with my shirt off sometimes. I'm female. I don't want this being viewed. Third, not everyone has a webcam. Fourth, they would lose a lot of players who refuse to allow that sort of spying.  




 Guys, don't just downvote, explain why he's wrong.

That is extremely unlikely to the point of being almost impossible. Selective breeding is often inbreeding. This passes recessive traits along instead of letting dominant, better traits show. It is extremely unlikely that very many recessive will show. Do a little research on genetics. Start with basic 8th grade Punnet Square type stuff and see if it helps you understand a bit better.
 




 There are zillions of alternate timelines. Every single decision sparks a new one. There is a timeline somewhere in which my cousin wasn't killed in a drunk driving accident because she made a decision not to get in the car. There is a timeline somewhere in which I got sprite instead of lemonade at Wendy's and it took less time so my car got hit on the way out. 

More tinfoil-ish; everyone but me is a robot and I am the only remaining human. 




 Woah woah woah. Let's not get carried away. Manual as an option. 




 Damn... Well I hope it was worth the buy for you anyway! 




 Serious question; are you a lesbian? If so, is it really worth the buy? 




 I have camped my whole life, though we had a pop up when I was a kid. It didn't have a bathroom or a kitchen big enough to actually use, though, so it wasn't a big step up. My wife and I are looking forward to camping this summer and we have a tent. It's just the two of us and perhaps guests periodically. We live in the Poconos and will be camping in local Outdoor World campgrounds with full facilities for bathrooms and showers. What should I know about tent camping? 









 I don't think you have a very good understanding of how elections work. No, the only two choices aren't great. However, it's pretty useless to invite the one who will do the most bad to sit down to dinner by default. I'm a liberal and a married gay woman. If we get the wrong republican in office in 2016, I run the risk of my marriage being called invalid and having businesses be legally permitted to
 discriminate against me. We all run the risk of bathroom bans for trans people, no more healthcare for everyone, and supreme court judges being appointed that will ensure that that remains for a long time. By voting for a third party you are basically saying "eh, fuck it. Who cares what happens to the country?" you aren't actually taking a stance, you are simply throwing a fit and not contributing.  




 Except by voting third party, you take a bit from a candidate with actual potential to win and do good and throw it in the dirt. 




 This is a reaction to have if OP asks and she says no. To start here is a bit counterintuitive. You aren't totally wrong, just a little trigger happy. 




 Mom? 




 Probably hamstering, amirite, Eltek? 




 You aren't a dumbass. We all know that your respect for him isn't why you said it. You said it because it's hilarious.

 Not my opinion, just the reason. Cis people are *real* men or women and just man or woman is enough, since trans people are fake versions. 




 Having babies doesn't stretch a woman out, yo. 




 She was a bit too abrasive about it. Her intention was probably not to hurt you just more to say that she doesn't want to be badgered not to after her sister just badgered her into it. 




 You are a bit wrong. If we assume mom is heterozygous A, meaning genotype AO and dad is heterozygous B, meaning genotype BO, then kids can be AO, meaning type A, BO, meaning type B, AB, meaning type AB, or OO, meaning type O. A and B are codominant. If you have both, both will present. O is recessive. If you have one O and one of either A or B, the other will present. If you have two Os, you will be O. Understand or should I clarify? 




 I just talked to my wife about this and we are both in agreement that it's not really OPs choice here at all. 




 In an experiment with fruit flies, a previous partner's sperm could alter the genetics of a child. TweRPs believe people are equal to fruit flies. It's bad anatomy. 




 /u/miss_clarity was really just being nice and trying to offer more info to OP. She didn't come flipping out that he was a dick for not using that phrase. Not everyone needs to be politically incorrect all the time, either. 




 I'm 20. I have twin 15 year old sister in laws. They are the age I was when I lost my virginity to their sister. It's horrifying to me that they could be having sex. They're still little kids. 




 Being an SJW is nothing to be ashamed of, despite Reddit making it a dirty word.  




 Mensrights would be for me.  




 There really isn't, though. With the blessing you may defy his wishes anyway, but you are still asking if it's okay by him, when really it only matters if it's okay with the woman you are intending to marry. 




 My brother and I would "save our farts up" for until we could fart in the bath or pool and make bubbles. Obviously it didn't work. We would also pick each other's noses and feed it to each other and we would put our cheeks together and wiggle our tongues, basically making out without touching tongues or lips. 




 Well to be fair that tradition kind of says that the woman is "owned" by her father and, if he agrees to it, then "owned" by her husband. Literally all that's missing is a thousand bucks and a goat for the trade. 




 "M-marriage, sir?" 




 My mother in law was pregnant with triplet girls and one of them was miscarried. During the c section she had her tubes tied. 15 months later she gave birth to another girl. 




 You're not supposed to think anything. The person I initially replied to was asking for stories of weird coincidence surrounding miscarriage. I provided that. 




 No, it doesn't. The baby had no heartbeat. It died. 




 The baby didn't have a heartbeat. The baby died. 




 Oct/Nov 2007 - Brother and sister in law get pregnant.

Nov 4 2007 - cousin dies

Nov funeral - b and sil tell family privately that they are pregnant

Mid Nov - baby dies; no heartbeat, sil has fetus removed medically.

Feb 2008 - sil gets pregnant again

Nov 4 2008 - nephew is born 




 I live in the Poconos. It's red neck central up here. 




 The first baby died really early on. It was extremely traumatic for my sister in law. She had to have a D E (basically an abortion since the baby wasn't viable) and was really torn up about it. 




 My cousin died on November 4, 2007. At her funeral, my brother and sister in law told us that they were pregnant. The baby didn't have a heartbeat when they went for the appointment. On November 4, 2008, they had their son.

Edit: since reddittors can't read, having no heartbeat means the baby died. 




 I speculate that people don't recognize until that point. My mom has it and has had symptoms since childhood, including visible ones like dark skin, and it wasn't picked up on until her brother started having issues when she was in her thirties. Since my mom has it, noticing it for me was much easier. I started having trouble with iron when I was 17. It's possible that my experience is just extremely rare, but I think more research needs to be done. 




 I buy men's. I'm nonbinary and if I want to pack they provide the space but once I got used to wearing them I don't even notice that there is so much extra. 




 Boxer briefs from Aeropostale are my go to. So comfy and they fit me well. 




 I know a lot of you don't share underwear but my wife and I do. It just makes times like this one easier. Typically she runs out first and uses mine. However, I stupidly procrastinated forever on laundry and these suck. Whenever I do this, I remember why I switched in the first place. 




 It relates to red blood cells which women have less of naturally and they lose some more with menstruation. Just a quick Google search for that, though. Men are also more likely to have hemochromotosis than women. 




 You realize that, from the title, we can only really infer that OP had sex twice in ten months, right? If that's a lot to you, go to /r/deadbedrooms. 




 I had '89 740GL that I paid 275 for in 2013 last me six months and then a '97 850 cost 800 that ran great until it got hit last month and was totalled. I love Volvos. 




 They also let your child stay with you. 




 One person can love a nonbiological child, the other can't. It's not really that complicated. 




 It's not cheap for lesbians. It can take multiple cycles and sperm isn't exactly cheap either. There are better success rates if you have a doctor inseminate and better yet with ivf, all of which costs money. Someone else's struggle isn't any less real because yours is worse. 




 No, it's not. Not everyone has the capacity to love an adopted child the same way. It's better if those people are honest and don't adopt. 




 Not dead, but sick.

My grandfather was an alcoholic so my mom has avoided drinking for her whole life. In my 20 years I have seen her drink three times, each time was one glass at a wedding. On Valentine's Day she was diagnosed with cirrhosis. 




 We love you, too, ANUS_POKER. 




 A lot of people don't know the difference between the two terms. Most people who say conception is the start of life mean that fertilization is. 




 Fertilization - sperm enters egg.

Conception - fertilized egg attaches to uterine lining. 




 I hate getting in but then I hate to get out.  




 That's a bit different; you initially left out the ADD. 




 Kit Kat bar! 




 I took care of us and she took care of the chores.

I'm going to just let you think about that statement.
 




 Even if not exact it should be similar. Thanks for sharing! 




 Huh. I saw a chiropractor for six months and am still in pain since they are huge. I need to get this shit written down. 




 So you're one of those "I make more money and change the oil so you can do the lowly chores that I deem myself too good for" types. 




 The point is that, as a member of the household/family unit, he should do it on his own and not need coaching like a child.
