 very relevant username.

 did an x-post over in /r/specart. hopefully we'll pick up a few new subscribers.  




 we could use a new influx of users.

 while researching your pic i found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AbandonedPorn/comments/3bf5o5/japanese_machine_gunners_nest_on_iwo_jima_that/ 




 A heavy machine gun, possibly a Japanese Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun, lies abandoned in a bunker overlooking the landing beaches. There are still dozens of these bunkers all over the island. Most of them were destroyed during the battle. This pillbox still bore the scars of the fighting. It was pockmarked with bullet holes and the inside was blackened. I imagine a flame thrower was used to clear that pillbox.

 she painted this on a canvas. no computer programs.  




 hands 









 so long and thanks for all the fish... 




 source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html 









 

Anna magically captures classic romanticism of renaissance portraiture, figurative forms while creating art that is completely modern and original. Anna is inspired by the graceful elegance of the female form, at turns, classically alluring, demure and provocative. 

Some words from the artist: 

  "My art is a reflection of my life, a reflection of myself...
"...If an artist were asked what he was thinking of while creating his work, he would hardly give a reasonable answer to that question. This process can not be analyzed. It is like a miracle. "

More about this particular piece: 

 She stands before us, half-exposed and half-mystery. We chase her for evermore inspiration but never exhaust her complex character. She continues to surprise us through her eclectic taste and individuality. Her wild arrangement of fabrics stands as evidence of her raw character.

source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html but i highly recommend them if you like this piece.

 i've always enjoyed [this PS](http://i.imgur.com/5FmnxrU.jpg) of him. 




 under US law; farmers can still use a small amount of chemicals on their crops and still call them "organic". Truth. 

no such thing as natural b/c the FDA allows company's to take advantage and embellish what *is* really natural. Hydrogenated Oil's are not natural. But you'll often find them in food products labeled to dupe the consumer while still offering a product at a responsible cost to the consumer but also maximizes company profits *b/c they use cheap ingredients*.   




 only the devil could survive two heart-attacks and still be alive. 




  Still doubt it, our military is pretty much the best. 

that's a pretty good reason, why we're going broke.
