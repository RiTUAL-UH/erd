 I see you've constructed a new lightsaber.  





























 Let me guess - prayer. Which is what they suggest for everything. Except defense, then it's all "Hey, we should all chip in to stop them thar terrorists. But the things actually killing people? Nah, just pray and work hard! Git r done!" 




 OH.....so NOW people are worried about money in politics?

Super pacs are great, lobbyists buying off congress is cool, but damn - when it comes to a debate we need to be careful! 

















































 My Advice: I didn't like it either. Didn't get through first season.

Then I listened to others. It gets a lot better and well worth watching. Folks here were right, tell your sister they were right... 














 The new legislation is expected to include:

*     introducing Banning Orders for extremist organisations who 
seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech in public places, 
but fall short of proscription

*     new Extremism Disruption Orders to restrict people 
who seek to radicalise young people

*     powers to close premises where extremists 
 seek to influence others
 
*     strengthening the powers of the Charity Commission 
 to root out charities who misappropriate 
funds towards extremism and terrorism

*     further immigration restrictions on extremists

*     a strengthened role for Ofcom to take action against
  channels which broadcast extremist content
 
























 She will quit before she even starts. 




 Conservatives will be upset that facts will be taught and not mythology. 

What's next, an abstain from driving class because if you don't drive you won't ever have an accident and our founders and Jesus didn't have cars.  










































































 God helped us elect Obama over any of the conservative fundies that were running. He also helped gay marriage to get passed in many states.

God sure is busy. 




 Why? Maybe because you have access to more information. I am in the US and I watched the entire 7 hour house of commons discussion on gay marriage. It was illuminating.

Having access to views other than you own can be a freeing thing. Some though don't want their views challenged and rely solely on 'faith'. 

Conservatives don't generally like facts - hence why they want text books not to mention evolution, cut library funding, why they only listen to those who espouse their own 'beliefs'. The internet opens up the world to a sharing of information and knowledge - which directly challenges conservatives and is one reason they don't like it and find it 'liberal'. Facts aren't liberal, but the right sure does like to call em that. 
























 I'll be 50 this year and I still think about Susan Dey at times :) She was my 'teen idol' (though not the only one).  









 Consider this. One of the things they often ask (not saying always, honestly not sure but I have seen it asked on the forms) is if you have ever had sex with another male. Suppose you were molested as a kid/teen. You answer yes and suddenly your aren't able to donate/sell blood. 

It was (last time I looked) overly broad. Not to mention you could be much older and you fooled around when you were a teen, etc and so on.

Broad policy is too broad. It's as simple as that.
 














 Probably because in toledo, when people die, they always go somewhere better. So the mean folks there let you live just to be jerks ;) 




 Wow, that article was just stupid - looks like an angry kid wrote it.

Then again, no one ever accused deadbart of being journalism. It is simply partisan hype for people who don't like facts and want to emotionally charge up their feelings on issues.

I would be interested in talking to some people who take them seriously though. Would be an interesting conversation. 














 Toledo might be worse :) 
























 Good. 


































 Professor Falken says: "The Bees" 









 That is so he can hook up with the ISIS folks that Obama is stashing just over the border. He is flying them in using the stolen libyan jets the right was warning us about last year. Once here they will finish the job of helping Obama spread ebola using illegal immigrant kids from south America that isis trained - and as our population dies off from the ebola Obama will be able to establish his caliphate. 

It's all so obvious, why don't libtards see it like them super smart conservatives?? 




 I don't, but you might check ghostery if you are using that as it may be blocking the widget used.  
























 The one with a single unnamed source? Yeah, guessing not as reliable as some want it to be. The same people who still think that Benghazi happened the way the right portrayed it back in the day will probably believe this without question though. 














 Don't really agree. Yes, I am disappoint in some of his actions (like this one, drones, etc) but overall I don't think this admin stands against 'everything' libs/progs want. Gays in the military, something done with health care (though not single payer), leaving Iraq, not going to war in Syria and Iran...plenty of positive compared to if we had a republican in power.

I am an independent who leaned republican in the 80's an 90's - but since then repubs have went batshit crazy. George Bush was worst president in my 50 years of life and I can't imagine someone like cruz being president.

I'll take a bad dem over anything the crazy party has to offer any day. Hell, I'd take UK's David Cameron over any US person currently running on the repub side.  





























  *Blacks and Latinos make up just more than a third of the citys population, yet those groups made up nearly two-thirds of the citys traffic stops, including searches.*

I am guessing that if they stopped and searched people of other races the same amount they might find the same issues that crop up here. 

 Cordell shows that police have pulled over, searched and handcuffed blacks and Latinos at higher rates last year than their share of the citys overall population.

When you grow up in an area like this and you are stopped more often than whites, cuffed, etc, it may have some affect on you. If 10% of the people driving have an open container, pot, etc in the car and you pull over one race more than another...chances are you will get more of that race going to jail. Which then leads people to say "See, higher crime, more cops there to catch them!" which just feeds the original problem. 







































 One show I have never seen, but one had a hard time escaping it's cultural impact and references. I am sure other shows will take it's place. 

Maybe they should make a show where people try to make show like Idol and the winner gets it funded :) 









 I wonder if they spend much time talking about how Laura Bush killed someone and how she felt about that? Probably not - because, as I recall, after the bush failure and 9/11 happened the right was telling us that we needed to be real Americans/Patriots and stand behind Bush.

They don't like Obama because he beat them twice, which has really brought out the nutcases. Look at their reactions to 9/11 and Beghazi as but one example out of hundreds. It's not rational - it requires people to be emotionally unsettled.

They let hate fuel them and toss out their principles in favor of it. They rally behind theocracy loving people like ted cruz and act like and American isis because they fear god will send hurricanes/etc on America because gay marriage. That is not rational - but they firmly believe god himself cares and will punish America. 




 Conservatives lose on the issues and logic, so they appeal to baser things like emotion. Look at the whole Benghazi debacle - been investigate and it hurt their feelings that it didn't find what they had all been claiming. So they cried a lot and investigated more. And they keep doing it.

They emotionally got behind an Iraq war, believed lies, and cheered on expansion of powers for the government with patriot act/tsa/etc. It made them feel patriotic (compare to the ACA, they love to call it Obama care, but the Patriot act they shy away from connecting bush to).

Another emotion they live with is fear. They are afraid of immigrants, isis, blacks, and non-christian people. People like Rush and Hannity know this and play on those fears - and cons tune in en masse to be preached to by father figures who tell them everything will be alright if just pray, wave flags, buy more bombs, and help less people in need. 




 The article is BS, but assuming it were true I guess it means I wouldn't vote for Obama next election.

PS - Really wouldn't care if it were true, Bush is still walking around a free man after the Iraq war BS so Obama has a long way to go before republicans can complain. 




 It's a fake site. Sad. Figure most people would know this already, LOL. 




 It's a plane. It's function is safely deliver paying customers from one point to another. It's not a danged carnival ride. 

If the Captain felt something would, in some manner, bring potential harm to either other passengers or the plane, he had a duty to act on it.

What would Captain Kirk/Picard/Kangaroo do? 









 Weird, more came in under bush than Obama - was he spouting nonsense like this back then to his little sheep?

Between him, beck, rush, hannity, levin, and fox is it any wonder people think of conservatives as idiots these days? All emotional drivel for their mindless masses. 









 Yeah, and I want cops to stop harassing and killing people. Maybe when that happens I will lend an ear to what they are whining about now. 
























 Dumb. The prof. should have had students get naked in order to join the class instead. Makes more sense to me... 




 This is brilliant. Probably the most brilliant thing you have ever posted. 









 "First, Tommy, let's do some tests. See if you can put that round peg of yours in the right hole." 














 I am going to make a guess here and say he is a conservative/fundie.

Those folks need to put down their torches and come out of the caves and meet the 21st century and realize the world is bigger than their bigotry. 




 Dang, she raised more than an Indiana pizza shop. The right was all about how awesome it was...wonder if they think the same about this. Huh. We will see. 




 Suddenly, because of jeebus, some on the right are against their fellow humans being free to enter into contracts with each other and having those contracts recognized by the government. 

Going by their views divorced people shouldn't be allowed to marry, non believers to believers, etc and so on.

I don't get it. Well, I kind of do. These super smart people are sure that God will rain down destruction on the US if gays can marry (even though they can in many countries). God doesn't care about the sick and poor being screwed over, wars like Iraq, crime, and so on. Nope. Just gays.

Your god sucks and you don't truly believe in him (Heck, based on the fundies we don't need a military, God will just swoop down and destroy the bad people....oh wait...the right pushes for more military. Maybe because they think their god is a wimp?) 




 Yes...It will liberate you from your rights, your lands, your own religious ideals, and in some cases - your life.

It is interesting, to me anyway, how the rw fundies in this country now claim that Christianity is 'better' and more liberal than it was before (which they state when talking about Islam/Isis/etc).

Which basically says: "Yeah, we changed our faith and beliefs, but we won't do that now. And we believe that other faiths aren't as advanced/liberal as ours is now. But we hate liberals and progressive ideals."

Your faith was wrong before, you reformed it time and time again, and yet now you think it is all ok and doesn't need to change anymore. I am a little skeptical. 









 A good and free, short, book about that from 1877:

 *Nike has 26,000 U.S. employees and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes.*

So give them the ability to hire more low wage or slave labor across Asia and they will toss in 10k jobs here. Yeah. OK. They are based here, have 1 million employees elsewhere, but only 26k here in their own country. Something just isn't adding up imho. 















































































 He should have just said "The perp and I made eye contact and it scared me. Scaring a cop is a shooting offense. I only had a split second to make a decision...was that a gun on his belt or a cell phone?" 







































 If you think that is bad, look at how some are freaked out by us not having a white president. It is like every talk radio station and conservative blog/'news' station/etc are constantly trying to get him impeached over everything.

Now it's "Jade Helm" or some such crap. They will investigate Benghazi way more than 9/11/2001 just because. He wasn't born in the US. He will, without a doubt, use his powers to take every gun in the US and crash the stock market, etc....

You can only cry wolf so many times before people laugh at you. 




 But, but....It's Jeebus! 







































 Oh, I am fine with backlash here. But fox is about as biased as they come and aren't doing anything here to 'debate' an issue but to back up what they and others already feel about the left. As one can see they grabbed this from The Daily Caller - an obvious RW blog.

Fox isn't really 'reporting' on it. They grabbed a little blurb from another site and pushed that narrative with no context (which they don't need, most fox viewers just need headlines and a blurb and they are sold on something). 




 Difference is - this guy doesn't represent most on the left. The right is a small tent made up of fundies and people who all think mostly alike. Hate muslims, don't want to allow their fellow american citizens (gays) to serve their country or get married, think all poor people are lazy welfare bums, etc.

I can find wackos on the left to be sure (am an independent and have been registered so since 1984 - though I did vote for both reagan and bush) but they represent less of the group because there is less group think on the left and more fractured 'tents' (some are pro gun, some anti, some religious, some not, etc and so on).

Pick any given conservative and you will find they represent a large chunk of them.  




 Oh, I have a problem with it - and also with who is pimping it and why. It's fox news, they are feeding their sheep with this to try and reenforce the bias of those who watch their 'show'.  




 SO, some guy I have never heard of says something silly and fox blows their dog whistle for their obedient, mindless, folks and they come running.

Man...they know how to manipulate their audience very well (not hard when their thinking skills boil down to 'someone with red/white/blue in their newscasts told me what I believe!') 




 The things which are harming Americans the GOP loves and embraces by blaming those people for it.

The things we already have defense against and aren't killing us they want to spend money on.

All in the name of Jesus. Because we all know true conservative fundies believe you can pray away sickness, being homeless, hungry etc - but you can't rely on a weak god to protect you so you have to spend money on weapons. 
























 Well, since women are physically different than men I can see some of their uniforms reflecting that. The universe isn't unisex. I am guessing fat storm troopers would need a modified uniform as well - but we only ever see thin guys in them. Diversity is lacking at times in that regards :) 




 I don't see the 'sexualized' part of it. Do some people think that a woman can't be both appealing (to some anyway) and a storm trooper? That seems a tad prejudiced IMHO. 

"Oh hey, you look pretty and have a nice body, therefore you should be working in the Cantina serving drinks to space pirates."

Yeah. No. 







































 Sure. Soon as we stop waving it every time we kill people we don't like in wars started on lies, when we stop torturing people and acting like animals, and when it means something decent and not screw the gays, the poor, the sick. 

I think the flag is used too much by people as a blinder. It is like when they turn on fox news and are blasted with red/white/blue which is code for 'it's ok to lie, just look at these colors and you will believe'.  


































 "No, there is another." 




 They will say "See, this will help those people get rich! We can suck up all their water and pull more of the chemicals we need to find oil and free the US from foreign oil dependency. A win-win for us all when we recycle your well water for you." 



















 Sure. Now that people are aware of the suit they can join in and maybe settle for a case of Blue Moon :) 





























 I am not sure I have ever drank hot dog water to know. I will take your word for it :) 




 Dang, it's that easy to get gold? I have been doing it wrong all this time :)

Since no one really ever sees me drink beer I can drink what I like without concerning myself what others think. And if someone wants to complain about my choice they are free to buy me the beer they want me to drink. 




 I'll be keeping an eye on you ;) 





























 Because republicans just want to get the "truth",  they keep finding it, but it isn't what they wanted.
