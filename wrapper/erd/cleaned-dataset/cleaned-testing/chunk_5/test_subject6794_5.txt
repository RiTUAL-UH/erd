 Well I should specify that by "like these" I mean articles that are about sharing experiences from people who are from oppressed groups about their experiences in order to promote better understanding about their group, or articles people write to clear up common misconceptions perpetuated by the media about certain groups. Here's some other ones that I thought were pretty good:

 I have no idea why your gyno would say that. Yeah, using speculums and getting pap smears can be a little uncomfortable, but putting in tampons should never be painful. You need another doctor who will actually listen to you. I would suggest asking friends or family about who they see, maybe they can give you some good recommendations? 




 [Spoilers ADWD] (/s "Stannis' men probably ate it on the way to Winterfell.") 




 The first time I did it I think it took me like 6 or so hours? I was so frustrated, ended up looking for a guide, too. Really that level has absolutely no flow and gives you barely any cues about where you should be going or what you should be doing and when. Just poorly designed in general. 




 So it was over modding practices? Ok, I see why that could be a problem. I don't really want to open old wounds either so we can just leave it at that. 




 I'm glad that Cracked has started publishing a lot more articles like these. Unfortunately there are still more than a few not-so-nice comments, but not nearly as bad as I was expecting. Tried to correct a few people who were very adamant about how your DNA should dictate which bathroom to use because otherwise it's not fair to the cis people, but not sure if the effort was worth it. 




 Or you could, you know, just stop assuming people's sex based on their gender presentation. 




 A little off topic, but what exactly was the whole schism between /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow about anyway? I didn't start redditing until a little while after, so I keep seeing people mentioning it but I really don't get it since as they are now the two subs seem pretty similar to me. 




 Seriously. The only thing that could make that situation worse would be if the manager was also shitty about it. 




 Being open certainly makes my relationship with my SO easier. I'm asexual, he's straight, so if he can get sex somewhere else it really takes a lot of pressure off of me. 




 I've been pretty stressed out lately. In the short term, I just got back from spring break but my professors scheduled two exams and a paper to be due right afterward, which to me seems silly because the whole point of a spring break is that *you are taking a break from school,* not "oh you have so much more free time to study now so giving you twice the usually amount of work shouldn't be a problem, right??" Ugh.

Of course, I'm also having long-term problems because right now I don't have an actual job job so much as a I sell things on Etsy occasionally job, but our lease runs up in May and my roommates and I will be hard-pressed to make the money last long enough to make down payments and our new rent throughout the rest of the summer, even if I do get a real job. I just feel like time is constantly running out for me and it's really wearing me down.

Honestly, on days like today I sometimes wish that I could just quit school and work full time doing costumes and props and stuff and have that actually be a viable financial option, but it's not so I just have to tough it out. 




 I think that is probably the key. Sure, everything should be able to have jokes made about it, but whether you personally are knowledgeable enough about something to make an intelligent joke that gets everyone to laugh at it is a completely separate matter.

For instance, a lot of people get up in arms about rape jokes (and apologists for the comedians who make them). And for good reason - a lot of the jokes made are by male comics who have never been threatened with sexual violence. In their ignorance, their "jokes" merely perpetuate casual sexism. But then there are also quite a few well-made jokes about sexual assault done by female comedians that address the issue in a way that doesn't make anyone feel icky or guilty for laughing at it. One of my favorites is probably [this one](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=video cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CDMQtwIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJv5pjSRSLGQ ei=6CopU5HrBKKT0QGjnoCYBw usg=AFQjCNEL8ux845yL89JRK5UGUmXXFRdkwQ sig2=_usgXErvnWnZKN3c_iec1Q bvm=bv.62922401,d.dmQ) by Wanda Sykes.

So yeah, no one should be excluded from humor. But how you frame the joke and the person who is telling it also matters. 




 Well, I don't know about that - there are some people who are paralyzed and lose use of their legs but retain their sexual capacity. We have no way of really knowing though, since I don't think Bran has really gone fully through puberty yet if at all ... 




 /internet hugs/ I know the feeling. I'm glad your SO's family is so supportive and nice! 




 At the Chinese food place by my university campus I'm the "sweet and sour chicken with sauce on the side, white rice, and a coke." 




 Wow. What a pig. I hope he chokes on his chocolate. 




 I don't normally tell people what to do in their relationships, just offer options or say "well this is what I would do if I were in the same situation." However, in this case I will make an exception.

You should probably leave him. Sooner, not later.

You should definitely go see a doctor, and I would also file a police report (of course, if you go to the E.R. and it's bad enough the doctors will call the cops). Seriously, that sort of behavior is not at all okay. Not only was he being incredibly rude, but he assaulted you and in typical abuser fashion later decided to both apologize and try and shift the blame onto you. Don't fall for it. You are not at fault here, he is definitely in the wrong. He has no right to your property, nor does he have a right to throw things at you or hit your or kick you, and he definitely doesn't have the right to try to keep you from leaving. That's at least three different criminal charges. Do not take this lightly. You're not overreacting for being scared or confused. What he did was wrong, you were in an awful situation, and there are a lot of potential problems facing you in the future.

As other comments suggested I would also recommend seeking legal advice to see about separating your name from all the stuff you cosigned with him. At this point I wouldn't even consider the possibility that this is a one-time thing and you might be able to "work things out," this sort of behavior is toxic as fuck and I don't think I've ever heard of someone doing this sort of thing only once.

And again, I have to emphasize that you should report this to the police as soon as possible. Having the assault on record would certainly help matters whenever you try to separate your assets, also if you do turn out to be pregnant it will be important in determining custody.

I'm so sorry that you had to go through this, I really hope that you are able to sort things out and he never hurts you like that again. Just remember, your safety is the priority here - you shouldn't feel guilty about taking legal action against him. 




 It helps if you play something so completely different that you don't even compare it to Bioware stuff. For instance, I'm really into the Etrian Odyssey series. Not much in the way of plot, the main drive to play is the challenge and the mechanics. It's a test of your strategic skills. So naturally I classify it in a totally different category than DA:O which is more narrative-heavy. 




 Yes, especially if you can get the Ultimate edition. The DLC is a lot of fun. Although the Mage's Circle quest is pretty much the bane of the fandom, the rest of the game is definitely enjoyable. Also, the potential party members are all rather varied and pretty interesting and/or funny. I would certainly recommend it. Not my favorite game, but certainly up there when it comes to medieval fantasy RPG. 




 Yeah! More PSP VNs would be fantastic, especially otome games! 




 The last game I spent a lot of time playing with my SO was Rayman Legends. We both enjoy platformers a lot, finally beat all the main levels and started on the back to origins levels. 




 Video games. I still haven't finished (or even started) so many of the games that have come out over the past year, but I keep buying them because I know I definitely want to play them at some point (most likely whenever I go on break from school). 




 Because horn that is obviously old and magical, would be my guess. I entertained the idea myself, I will admit. Not really sold on it, though. 




 Also, his injury kind of leaves Bran in a bad position when it comes to inheriting his lordship/kingship/whatever title the Starks eventually get. It's not impossible for him to come back and rule, and there are plenty of other examples of lords who aren't very physically strong for whatever reason (Doran Martell, for instance). However, I don't think ruling would ever appeal to Brandon, and even if he did return to Winterfell he would likely give up his title and pass it to Rickon anyway. 




 I dunno, I feel like after reading ADWD his identity is much less built around being Ned Stark's son and more associated with his identity as a Brother. After all, he still has a lot of resentment toward the Stark family; as with Theon, he was never truly one of them, no matter how much he wanted to be. And any time he questions himself, he always reminds himself of his vows. The Wall is his anchor now, not Ned.

Also, regardless of what name he decides to take, I'm pretty sure he'll always be "Lord Snow." 




 The only contention I have with this is that Arya doesn't kill completely without remorse. Especially with her earlier killings, she expressed shock but dealt with it because if she hadn't killed someone she would have died herself. She also expressed worry whenever the Hound was bringing her to what would be the Red Wedding that after learning about all the things she did Catelyn and Robb wouldn't love her anymore. I'd say that's not killing "without a hint of remorse." She is definitely burdened. But she moves on and deals with it. I think the turning point is probably after the Red Wedding. For all she knows her entire family is dead, so she wanders around lost for a while, but becoming a faceless man is her way of building resolve. She's learning to accept death and starting to develop a new world view - although her vendetta against the people who have wronged her certainly hasn't gone away. 




 Yeah, actually, I have two or three times. It's not very frequent, and usually the dreams are pretty awkward. Most of the time the stuff I dream about is not at all realistic so I usually wake up going "well, that would never happen!" and laugh it off. 




 You need to have a frank, honest discussion with your friend. To be honest, even if she is bi, if she told you she's freaked out by penises you should probably stop pursuing any sort of physical relationship with her. Clearly, she is uncomfortable with it on some level, and while she doesn't seem to have a problem with other physical contact such as kissing she seems to realize you are attracted to her. If you want to put her at ease, talk to her about this.

If you really value her friendship, then show her that. Talk to her as a friend. Just tell her you want to clarify how things stand between the two of you. She's probably nervous about this and is afraid of confronting you. Show her that you won't freak out or get super angry or stop being her friend just because she doesn't want to have sex or anything like that. Just ask her to explain how she feels about you so that there are no more misunderstandings and you can both move on with less trepidation. Ask her about boundaries. What sorts of things are okay? What kind of contact is she comfortable with? If you establish boundaries and follow them, that will help put her at ease and build trust between the two of you, which is really important if you want to continue your friendship.

Hope this helps, good luck. 




  This isn't about asexuality, though

Problem is, asexual people are often treated pretty badly for not wanting sex, the same way that people will harass those who choose to be abstinent before marriage for whatever reason. I am 99% certain that if the post in AA had said that OP's partner didn't want to have sex because they were asexual, the comments would have gotten much worse than they already were. 




 I would suggest you have a conversation about this sooner rather than later. I'm sure that if you bring it up he'd be happy to talk about it, especially if you show how supportive you are. Just shoot him a text or give him a call and say you'd like to get together and talk about it sometime, maybe discuss it over lunch or something. It's not exactly something that should be kept private (at least from partners), so you shouldn't feel afraid to bring it up. Are you just nervous or embarrassed? That's okay, don't worry about it! It's important for people to share this kind of info with their partners, and afterward you'll probably feel closer than you did before. I'm sure he'll appreciate your candor and the fact that you're so open to an important part of his self. 




 I've only had one - same one, started off as high school sweethearts and now we've been together for 5 and a half years. 




 I think you win this subreddit. Probably the only time I have actually declared "WTF?" after viewing one of these images. 




 My only complaint was the font color. I guess OP went with red to fit the whole murder theme, but it would have looked better in white imho. 




 Well I'm not really sure why translation is an issue here, but whatever.

Yes, it is true that there are obviously going to be some changes during the localization process for any medium that crosses languages and cultures. Not everything can be translated perfectly from Japanese to English, and some cultural context is always lost. The best thing we can do in these situations is to find a decent cultural analogue for the new version.

However, I would argue that while some dialogue changes are to be expected and some minor changes are acceptable, but changing the core part of a character is not. Especially if you're doing it at the expense of a marginalized community. 




 Yes, it does happen. You're right.

However, I think it should also be acknowledged that as the character was originally intended to be ambiguous, it's a little alarming that they are being progressively feminized with each new iteration. At first there was no indication of Hanji's gender. Then the Japanese anime started using female pronouns. Now the English dub is using a stereotypically feminine voice. If the character looks feminine, sounds feminine, and is referred to as feminine, they can no longer be called gender ambiguous - Hanji is now being portrayed as female.

And as a person who also sounds naturally feminine but is more androgynous, this is kind of disturbing to me. They're taking a character that lots of marginalized folks could really relate to and are now warping them into just another average woman. Not that having woman characters is bad, it just sucks that they're taking away literally the ONE CHARACTER that people who don't fall neatly into "male" or "female" can be represented by. 




 I have no idea how this comment is even relevant. 




 Yes, but the author also said that they weren't supposed to actually confirm whether Hanji was male or female. To quote the people [translating the manga](http://kodanshacomics.tumblr.com/post/73207971230/hello-i-wanted-to-ask-you-guys-a-question-about-attack):

Isayama has confirmed that were not allowed to confirm Hanges gender. He has instructed us to avoid gendered pronouns when referring to Hange, or at least to use he AND she with equal frequency.

In other words, Hanji is NOT supposed to be a "she," Hanji could be a "he" or a "she" or neither, this is intentionally ambiguous, and to deliberately use an obviously feminine voice is misrepresenting the character as that defeats the whole purpose of gender ambiguity. 




 Well I can't definitively tell you because I'm not the writer, but the implication is that Hanji is not male or female but rather gender neutral. How it might be important to the plot or character I can't say because again, I'm not the one writing it. Maybe the author just felt like having a nonbinary person in their comic. And it certainly can work in English, although it is slightly more difficult to do than in Japanese it is possible. There are ways to write around it, the easiest to just refer to Hanji as "they" instead of "he" or "she." 




 I would say that the Japanese voice actor didn't sound as feminine. Slightly, but the English actor seemed much more so. At least to me. Anyway, the point is Hanji is meant to be more ambiguous, and even the Japanese anime messed that up a little - they used female pronouns when the original creator intentionally left out gendered pronouns. 




 Except that Hanji is supposed to be nonbinary, and they make them sound WAAAAY too feminine. So no, actually, they picked wrong on this one. 




 Ah, yes, because if we just ignore all the shitty people in our lives then they will all go away and everything will be happy sunshine and rainbows!! 




 My relationship is really similar in a lot of ways. I'm a female panromantic asexual dating a straight male. I'm not really that into sex, at all, but we still have it fairly regularly (few times a month usually). I'm generally sex-neutral, and although I don't get a lot of personal fulfillment from it, I still enjoy it on an emotional level. I view sex with my SO not as a chore to make him happy, but as something we do together as a couple - just like going to the movies or snuggling on the couch watching Netflix. I enjoy it because I'm sharing something with him.

However, it's still not as often as he would probably like, if he were to have sex as often as he wanted. And I do sometimes struggle with feeling guilty that I can't fulfill all his needs. But the important part is that we love each other, even if we aren't entirely sexually compatible. He doesn't mind that we don't have sex too often, because to him making me happy is more important than him getting off. He's never pressured me to do anything I don't want to do, and I appreciate him for it. I feel like this attitude is really necessary if you're going to have a relationship with an asexual person and you're not asexual yourself.

Obviously you recognize the importance of communication in such a relationship (although communication is important in any relationship). My biggest advice to you is just to be honest, about everything. Even if you're feeling something selfish, even if you think it might hurt your partner's feelings, you need to be honest with her, and she needs to be similarly honest with you. Don't try to hold things in for your partner's benefit; that can lead to resentment, which can easily kill a relationship. It's better to tell your partner even about the less desirable or convenient thoughts and feelings you have, so that both of you can work out how to deal with them together. 




 Honestly, if you don't feel the burning need to come out and you feel like it's wasted effort since you won't see most of those people again, then you shouldn't have to come out. Coming out is an incredibly personal decision to make. You shouldn't let what anyone else thinks influence that choice too much, because you are the one who has to face the potential consequences of coming out. If I were you, I would weigh the pros and cons of doing it. If you feel like there's not a lot of risk in coming out (which it sounds like you have a lot of support already from loved ones, so that helps), it's worth considering. However, if you don't feel like there is any benefit, or the risks outweigh that benefit, then you don't have to force it.

I understand how you feel about letting people believe you're something you're not. If you don't come out, you can feel sort of dishonest or awkward, especially when people make assumptions about you that aren't true. However, at the same time you have to remember that the assumptions people make abut you aren't your fault. Our heteronormative society is to blame here, not you.

To sum all this up, I guess I should just say that you shouldn't have to feel ashamed of who you are and everyone should be able to live freely as themselves. But you also shouldn't feel guilty if you choose not to share that part of yourself. At the end of the day, who you love is your business, not anyone else's. 




 Yeah, I took that test. I score somewhat toward masculine but mostly in the middle for masculine, feminine, and androgynous. Pretty much lines up with what I identify as; female sex but gender nonconforming. It's interesting because a lot of cis people never question their identities, despite the fact that nobody fits 100% into only one category. But then a lot of people turn around and judge trans* people so harshly because they don't fit 100% into a given category either ... seems rather hypocritical to me. Honestly, I think that gender doesn't dictate your personality and is totally irrelevant to what you want to do with your life. You just identify with what feels right. Why is society so hung up on all these silly details? Why can't we all just be what we are and enjoy the things we enjoy? /shrugs/ 




 Bi erasure is super shitty. As someone who is panromantic and in an opposite-sex relationship, I feel that pain. 




 Nope. I don't want my own kids, I'd rather adopt if anything. Plus, if either party changes their mind vasectomies are reversible. 




 Yeah. His family has all sorts of crazy drama and despite the fact we've been together for over 5 years, I still don't know half their names. Fortunately we only see them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the occasional wedding/funeral. So it's not so bad.

At the very least, I feel relatively okay with his dad and brother, just not his mom or extended family. 




 So ... take tampons with you when you go hunting? 




 I've never cheated, although I'm asexual and in a poly relationship so not only is there no desire to cheat I also don't have to regardless.

I have been cheated on, though.

Edit: I'm 21, forgot to add that. 




 NOPE I was definitely not encouraged.

I remember one of my earliest gaming experiences was playing Pacman with my stepdad on an arcade table at our local pizzeria when I was six. We played once or twice, but I found out from that how much he loved Pacman (he was pretty good at it too). It's what got me interested; it was something to do, and clearly it had impacted my parental figure, so I was intrigued.

However, my mom was really against me and my brother having video games when we were little for typical mom reasons (they'll rot your brain, playing outside is better for you, go read a book, etc.). We didn't have any game systems until I was 12 or 13 I think? We got a Gamecube from my grandma for Christmas. Mom wasn't happy about it, but too late.

It was soon afterward that my younger brother started dominating the game system. Whenever we played we were limited to an hour a day, but lil bro was always spoiled; when I was reaching my hour limit, he would constantly pester me (even if I had plenty of time left) and sometimes even told my parents I was playing over my time and they would make me get off. However, whenever he played it was "just one more level ..." until he'd been playing all afternoon into the evening and wouldn't even come down to eat when we called him for dinner.

On top of this, despite putting "I want a Gameboy" or one or two games after we got the Gamecube on my birthday and Christmas wish lists every year, I got tons of gift cards to bookstores while my brother got nearly every game he wanted (this was mostly grandparents' doing). Every time my brother wanted a new game they took him to the game store; despite repeated requests to go along or to be taken at some point they never found time to take me or ask me before taking him.

Also, at one point someone opened up a gaming store similar to a net cafe (pay an hourly rate to use their PCs or consoles and have any game from their library type setup) near where we lived. It ended up closing within a year, but despite this my stepdad found time to take my brother there three separate times. They didn't tell me about it until after they got back the first time; I asked to go with next time but they never told me when they were going, I'd always hear about it after the fact. After it closed I expressed regret at never getting to go and my stepdad made some comment about how I never told him I wanted to - I just sat there dumbfounded because *I told you every single time after you went to take me with you next time.*

Even to this day, despite the fact that I am just as much of a gamer as my brother, stepdad's side of the family conveniently forgets this fact and may or may not get me one game while getting a whole stack of games for my brother. At least my mom has accepted my hobby now; she actually consults me whenever purchasing games for my brother because he has behavioral issues and she wants to make sure there's nothing too violent in anything she gets. For instance, she usually outright vetoes anything with guns, but asked me if Assassin's Creed II would be okay Christmas before last. I told her how the ESRB ratings work, and how they usually specify types of material that might be inappropriate for certain audiences (cartoon violence, sex, drugs, etc.); with that knowledge she eventually decided that she wasn't going to get him ACII but that the latest Sonic game would be more than okay.

Of course stepdad's family continues to spoil him and bought him every single other game my mom went out of her way to make sure no one on her side of the family would get him because they were too violent. They basically get him whatever he wants because he's the only boy - they've never shown any sort of spoiling affection toward me, and my little sister (she's the youngest) still doesn't get spoiled hardly at all, especially compared to my brother. It's pretty gross. 




 As I'm not an expert on locks specifically I'll just speak on cultural appropriation in general.

White people (or any privileged group) appropriating from oppressed ethnic (or other) minorities is shitty because it's basically white people saying "we're going to vilify you for doing this thing, then take that same thing and wear it (badly) as a costume." For instance, the feathered headdress thing - First Nation peoples in the Americas have suffered from genocide ever since Columbus first set foot here. Native peoples have been enslaved, deliberately infected with disease, massacred, forcibly removed from their homes, and robbed of their ancestral lands, languages and cultures. There are still people alive who were taken from their parents on reservations and forced to go to boarding schools or live with white families where they were literally punished for doing anything from their original culture (speaking their language, wearing their traditional clothes, etc.). BUT YET there are plenty of people, white people, who have historically perpetrated this genocide over and over again and who continue to perpetuate systemic racism, who like to dress up like Pocahontas every Halloween or wear headdresses for fun or have offensive caricatures for sports team mascots. You see how this is incredibly problematic, right?

It's the same thing with black culture. Black people were enslaved, brutalized, raped, tortured, and even after slavery was abolished by law they were still exploited in just about any way possible by the white majority in the U.S. Despite all this, they have managed to maintain their own unique cultural identity and have produced many great cultural feats - in music alone you have the origins of Jazz, Swing, Blues, R B, Hip Hop, etc. all from the black community. Despite all sorts of adversity, the black community has developed and continues to develop. But white society vilifies black people for doing these things. If black people wear natural hair or locks, listen to rap, etc. then they're called "ghetto" or "nappy" or "thug." But when a white person does it, they are unique or worldly and people pat them on the back for being so aware of other cultures. Violence against ethnic minorities is still a living reality here and in many other countries around the world. The idea that white people can appropriate from other cultures in this way is completely unjust.

So to address your questions about what we can do about it, one of the reasons why cultural appropriation is so offensive is because white people stealing from ethnic minorities often involves a) stigmatizing the original culture they took it from and b) using whatever they take out of context. The headdress thing is a good example - usually, only leaders who have proven their worth to a community are allowed to wear a headdress in First Nation cultures; the asshat who buys a cheap plastic version at a costume shop and wears it to a party hasn't earned the right to do so. They are wearing it out of context. In other words, they're doing it wrong.

So I wouldn't say that making sure all ethnicities can wear something without stigma is the issue. The real problem is the context of how they wear it. I would personally argue that we shouldn't necessarily bar white people from ever doing any of these things; after all, a little cultural admixture is healthy and often necessary for continued development (example - Chinese plows brought to Europe sparked the agriculture revolution which then fueled the industrial revolution). However, most people I've talked to tend to agree that people should earn the right to borrow whatever it is they're borrowing. If something is merely a cultural fad with no important deeper meaning to a culture, borrow away. But if it has some sort of religious or other cultural significance, treat that with respect. Don't use it if you don't know the story behind it or haven't done what anyone else of that culture has done in order to use it.

Edit: Wow, gold? Seriously? Thank you kind stranger, I never would have expected to get that sort of appreciation.  




 Yep. I totally agree. I happen to be a woman who cross dresses and likes a lot of "masculine" things, but that doesn't mean I'm any less of a woman than you or anyone else on this planet. You don't have to be masculine to be male, or feminine to be female - in fact, I'd say pretty much everyone has some mix of both kinds of qualities, so even dividing qualities into the "masculine" and "feminine" categories is pretty arbitrary. 




 Not gonna like, Dr. Girlfriend is my favorite character. Second favorite is a tie between Brock and Dr. Orpheus. 




 Why would you wanna get rid of that talent? Lol 




 Not trans, but my roommate and close friend is FTM. He struggles a lot because he isn't stereotypically masculine, and I always that it was really awful. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you have to buy into every gender stereotype there is. It makes me really sad to see people say things to trans people about how they aren't being feminine/masculine enough to pass and that they need to change all these things about themselves to fit into society's gender boxes. That's stupid and shitty. If you like your voice, you shouldn't have to change or "fix" it! Just be you : 




 Well, there is usually a little bonding between protag and whatever heroine during the sex scenes, but it's not so important that you'll be confused by anything if you skip them. 




 Most likely. Will doesn't really strike me as the type to just thrash around and throw a tantrum; he thinks things through. I'm sure he's probably biding his time and focusing on doing what little he can, given his incredibly trying situation. 




 I lean more toward extroversion. 




 Yeah. I definitely don't want my own kids. But if I were to have kids, I would adopt some older kids from foster care. There are a lot of older kids, especially teens, that are less likely to get adopted and I would rather give one of them a home than have my own baby. 




 I dunno, I feel like you can only be super angry about something like that for so long. Considering how incredibly intimate and subtle Hannibal's influence over Will is, I think he's probably feeling more disgusted by Hannibal than anything. This man violated his home, his relationships, his body, and his mind. Of course Will would be angry, but I know if I were in his position I would be less likely to react by yelling or physically attacking him and more likely to just want to throw up and go take an acid bath. 




 It looks sooooo adorable!! I'm a little jealous : 




 That's only slightly creepy ... 




 I'm from the Southern U.S., for context.

1) Not very important. Generally, in my group of friends, you are expected to notify everyone else if you start dating someone new, within the first month or so after you start going out with them. We are all free to comment on what we like or dislike about each other's partners, but just because they don't get along with someone doesn't mean I will stop dating them. My friends' approval is appreciated, but not necessary.

2) For the most part, yes. Usually I'm the first person someone asks when they need relationship advice (despite the fact that they all started dating before me). However, it's hard to distance yourself from your own circumstances, so sometimes it's important to get another person's perspective. That's where my friends come in. I ask them how they interpret things to see if I'm totally off base or if I'm being unreasonable about certain things occasionally. Also, if my partner does something that frustrates me or that I don't understand, they can sometimes help me think about it in a different way that clarifies the problem.

3) Yes, definitely. For one thing, there are certain topics we just don't go into detail about when all our male friends/boyfriends are around. But also, if we know they're listening in we sometimes exaggerate our opinions or behavior just to tease them. It's all in good fun.

4) Yes. Most of the friends my SO and I have are mutual friends that we both know. However, there are still several people I hang out with that he doesn't, and he hangs out with people I don't hand out with too. Also, even among our mutual friends, there are several people who are better friends with one of us than the other. Still, when we go on group outings it's expected that I bring my SO along and we all have fun together, unless it's specifically a girls' night.  




 Every time I hear someone ask a question like this, my knee-jerk response is to ask "why were the Europeans so far behind the Chinese in terms of technology 300 years before that?" 




 Childcare experts pretty much agree that the best way to get your kid to behave is to put them in time out or take away privileges (i.e. TV time, their favorite toy, etc.) when they do something bad, explain to them that you're giving them time out/taking something away because they broke the rules, and then keeping those rules consistent and always giving them the set punishment whenever they break the rule. As long as the kids know what the rules are and what happens when they break them, and the punishments for those rules are consistently applied, they behave a lot better than if you just yell at them for doing something you don't like. 




 You do realize that flirting with someone doesn't automatically mean you've signed a legally binding contract with that person that you will have sex? You can say no at any time if you change your mind - anyone who then proceeds to have sex with you regardless is wrong. Drinking and flirting do not explicitly tell someone you want to have sex, it tells them you want to drink and flirt. Telling someone enthusiastically that you want to have sex is the important part.

Also, there are plenty of people who don't say no but are still raped. If you're coerced in anyway or were somehow incapable of giving consent, even if you didn't say no, it is still rape. For example, if a date rapist slips something into a person's drink. Or if they threaten them with a weapon or say they'll attack someone they love unless they agree to sex. Or if they are in an abusive relationship and don't feel safe enough to say no. Or any number of situations. 




 People who don't have/have never known someone with a severe mental illness. 




 Wow. A lot of that is seriously unnecessary rudeness. It's like militant atheists who tell anyone who follows a religion that they're "backward" or stupid or whatever. People have different preferences; the whole idea of fighting for queer rights is that EVERYONE should be able to express their gender identity or orientation freely. Of course ces/het people already have that freedom, but that doesn't mean that they're wrong for being the way they are any more than queer people are for being the way they are.

Speaking as a queer/poly woman, I can definitely say that if someone said the same comments to me every time I commented on a man's appearance or something like that I would be pissed. There is no one "right" way to be attracted to people. Saying things like "maybe you do have something correct in you after all" is super fucked up, because that implies that only certain sexualities are "right" and everything else is "wrong." NOPE sorry try again.

As for the whole idea of berating someone for being monogamous, I personally believe that people aren't necessarily monogamous by nature. But just like sexual orientation, that doesn't mean that everyone is a certain way. I have lots of friends who are monogamous and in relationships and they could never imagine themselves living any other way. *And that's fine.* There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to have only one partner, the problems only start when you try to force your viewpoint on other people. Saying that everyone should be poly and that monogamy is unnatural is like saying that everyone has to like Neapolitan ice cream. What if you're fine with just vanilla, or only chocolate? That doesn't make you wrong, or a horrible person. It just means you have different tastes. Just don't try to keep anyone else from having Neapolitan, and everything should be good. 




 I'm 21 and met my current SO when I had just turned 16. We'll be celebrating our six year anniversary this summer. That's longer than most of my peers have ever been with someone; in fact, I'm friends with a couple that's married in their mid-twenties and we've been together longer than they have.  So yeah, I definitely get how you feel. Sometimes you meet someone and you just know that you want to build a life with them - it doesn't matter how old you are. 




 Well I hope that I've cleared things up for you. 




  If you have sex with someone doesn't that mean you physically attracted to them?

Not necessarily, although that is usually the assumption that people make. But in reality, there are any number of reasons people might choose to have sex with someone. Haven't you ever met someone that had sex with another person they aren't particularly attracted to because they just wanted to have sex and the person was available? Or what about sex workers who have sex because someone paid them to? I'm fairly certain that most prostitutes have had at least one client they weren't attracted to in the slightest, but they had sex with them anyway. 




 MFW I believe you when you say you're British because you said "series" instead of "season"

https://tattoosandtherapy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wasnt-expecting-1.gif?w=640 




 That's a fair point. 




 Yes. But at that age, a lot of kids don't even know what sex is, they just talk about holding hands or kissing, which is still a physical act even if most people associate it more with romance.

Anyway, there are different types of asexuality. The general consensus is that you're asexual if you aren't physically attracted to anyone regardless of their sex or gender. However, asexuals also separately categorize their romantic attraction, or sexes/genders they form emotional attraction to, and they are just as varied as sexual attractions.

In addition, there are also varying degrees of asexuality; there are people who are strictly asexual and never experience physical attraction, people who are allosexual (in otherwords, would identify as straight/gay/bi/pan/whatever), and people who are somewhere in between (demi, asexual-ish, gray-a, etc.).

And asexual people also have varying attitudes on sex; some of them hate or dislike sex and don't want to have it ever, some of them are sex positive and actually have a sex drive that just isn't directed at anything in particular, and some are neutral and don't care either way (I'm one of those). 




 Then that person would be a trans woman. 




 Well, basically attributing adjectives to actions is wrong because that's not what those words mean.

* Heterosexual: someone who is physically attracted to someone of the opposite sex/gender
* Homosexual: someone who is physically attracted to someone of the same sex/gender
* Bisexual: someone who is physically attracted to two sexes/genders
* Pansexual: someone who is physically attracted to all sexes/genders
* Asexual: someone who isn't physically attracted to any sexes/genders

Nowhere in these definitions does a particular sexual activity come up. It depends entirely upon your attraction. For a different example, how do you know if you are straight or gay if you're still a virgin? Because of who you're attracted to. What about people who are in the closet? Are you less gay because you don't tell people about it or even have an opposite-sex partner? No, this does not change how you feel. There are plenty of people who don't come out until later in life after they've been married and even had kids with someone. Does this mean they aren't really queer? No, it just means that they weren't acting on their preferences.

In that vein, I know that I am asexual because I'm not physically attracted to people. I've had sex before, but the act of sex is not strictly associated with attraction. It can be a way to express attraction to someone, but it does not determine attraction.

Saying that having sex means I can't be asexual is like saying that just because I've tried sushi once, I can only eat Japanese cuisine from now on. For one thing, it makes no logical sense because you're taking one action to its logical extreme. For another, it totally disregards how the person actually feels about what they did. What if I hated the sushi? What if I thought it was okay but didn't particularly feel the need to eat it ever again? Eating sushi once doesn't make me a sushi lover. Just like sexual experience doesn't dictate your identity. 




 I've pretty much known I was asexual since I was about eight or nine years old, because that was the time that all of my peers suddenly started gaining interest in romantic stuff and a lot of them had crushes, but I never did. I didn't really have a word to put to that feeling until high school, though. 




 Is it possible he could have flavored it with her blood serum or something? I don't know that much about brewing or cooking, no idea if this is actually possible, but the thought just occurred to me. 




 Being on the receiving end of butt sex does not make you gay. Being a dude who is attracted to dudes makes you gay. Actions do not define your identity, your feelings do.

As another example, I'm asexual, but if I have sex with someone that doesn't mean I stop being asexual. It just means I've had sex. 




 Actually KS came out in 2009 ... was translated to Japanese by 2010, at least according to vndb 




 Not first few, thanks, also yes it is somewhat general but I'm saying that the two games follow a very similar pattern. That's all. 




 The worst I've ever played? Probably [The Nettestadt Troll](http://www.renai.us/game/nettestadt.shtml). I didn't expect that much since it's one of those free Ren'py games that's essentially the equivalent of a bad fanfic, but this one is especially bad.

For one thing, the art is terrible. All of the women are drawn the same, just with different hair and colors. The backgrounds look like something you'd find in an elementary or middle school art class. It is thoroughly mediocre.

Also, the plot is super contrived and full of holes. It takes places in some random German village in the 1500s-ish. In the beginning the guys that are all your love interests get involved in some sort of uprising against the local lord, then there's a time skip and the village is being terrorized by a troll that threatens them with ... something (to be frank I don't even remember what the threat was). In order to appease the troll, the entire town decides to let the protag get dragged off by him to a cottage in the middle of the woods to be his sex slave. And then suddenly she is his waifu ... it makes absolutely no sense.

But what tops it off is the whole German thing. It's obviously made by someone who doesn't know that much about the German language or culture, because for most of the game there are no indications of such and then occasionally it's like the person who wrote it went "OH CRAP I NEED SOME GERMAN STUFF IN HERE" and it ends up coming off a bit like that scene from Evangelion [where Shinji climbs into Unit 02 with Asuka](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion#Asuka_Strikes.21_.5B1.8.5D). I think the kicker was when the troll is trying to seduce the protag and he asks her, "if I were a bratwurst, would you be my bun?"

At that point I about died laughing. It was pretty bad. 




 Ah, so there was some influence. I never saw any articles or anything from the devs of either game, so I was wondering about that. Perhaps I should do a google search and see if I can find some interviews with the Grisaia devs about it. 




 I know Yumiko's route did that, can't say for Makina as I haven't played it yet. 




 I won't lie, I really liked doomfest's art. I think it fit perfectly with the overall tone and theme of the game. That said, I also recognize the difficulties involved as an artist trying to adapt to another artist's style that is very different from your own. I think that considering the circumstances, you did a pretty good job, and I know that you will do your best to improve and make the art for this game to the best of your ability. So don't stress the community reaction too much, just work hard on making a good game that you can be proud of. 




 That looks so great so far! I'm really excited to see how it turns out :D 




 I already have resources for most of that, except for statistics/academic research (I need more) and famous people.

I don't know that surveying before I start will be helpful, at least at this point, because like I said in another comment I don't know how much time I have to present yet. We have the option to work by ourselves or in groups, so the time given will depend on how many groups there are.

I definitely plan on making a post with a general outline for my presentation before I give it, though. For the most part I'll probably be working from my own experience but I know that I'm representing the entire ace community as well and I want to a good job for everyone. So there will definitely be a chance for community input later on down the line.

As far as the questions, I've been asked a lot of weird things and I'm pretty well practiced at explaining this to people, so I imagine that part won't be an issue.

Thank you for all your suggestions and support :) 




 Thank you :D 




 LE GASP~~~ I don't believe it!! 




 Huh. Never knew Yahtzee wasn't into sex.  




 Lol I get mistaken for a man all the time on reddit ^I ^^wonder ^^^why 




 Yes. This happened to me quite frequently in high school, since I cut my hair super short and I dress androgynously. Then in college I got bigger boobs so it doesn't happen as often but I still make people wonder occasionally.

It doesn't really bother me. I like to cross-dress, so looking like a man is sorta the point. 




 According to the anthropology field, knitting is classified as a folk art and it totally a valid art form. But that "folk" part is probably the reason why most people don't recognize it as such - because it's not formally taught, people assume it isn't "real" art.

Next time someone says something about handcrafts not being art, you should tell them about the [Gee's Bend quilts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quilts_of_Gees_Bend). 









 Well like I said, it isn't entirely up to me - I don't know if there are any rules against it with the university (although I would assume not), and since I know I'll be fielding questions from people I don't want to record anyone without their permission, even if they will just be talking from off-camera. But assuming that those aren't issues, I know that I can rent a camera from our university's library so I probably will record it. 




 Aw, thanks! : 




 Thanks! I'm also thinking about recording it and posting the video online as well. Haven't decided yet, I'd probably have to get my professors' (and classmates') permission first. 




 That's a pretty good gif for how I feel right now xD 




 Oh, I had seen it but I totally forgot about it! Thanks for the link (and for reminding me) :D 




 Indeed! But I have no idea how much I'll include yet, since we have the option of working alone or in groups and the amount of time we're given for our presentation will depend largely on how many groups there are. 




 That's not a bad analogy, actually. I usually use types of food, since everyone can generally relate to food. 




 Yeah, I think that's pretty awesome that they added new gender categories. 




 I wouldn't say that everyone's SO needs to be their best friend too. After all, some people (myself included) need our own space and friendships apart from our SOs so we don't feel like we're becoming the same person.

However, my SO is definitely one of the closest friends I have, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing : 




 I actually thought he did a really good job of staying in character and not being a total idiot about it. Also, by feigning (?) ignorance, it keeps the dialogue going and a lot of people who watch his show and know nothing about trans* issues probably learned something. 




 I already posted about this in another sub, but I just wanted to share with you guys since everyone here is super supportive and awesome!

I'm a university student, and this semester I'm taking a communications seminar focusing on TED Talks ). We started discussing possibilities for final projects yesterday, and we have a lot of freedom with topics how we format our presentation.

The whole theme of TED is spreading "ideas worth sharing", and one of the biggest things I think is worth sharing is my identity - asexuality. I decided I wanted to do my own TED Talk for my final project focusing on asexuality: what it is, coming out, discrimination, etc. I brought up the idea to one of my professors (there's two for the class) and I was a little nervous about it since I don't usually come out to people in classes. But not only did she already know about asexuality (huzzah for getting to skip the lengthy explanation!) but she also immediately got really excited. She thought my topic was a great idea and really encouraged me to go for it.

I've gotta say, I'm not used to this sort of treatment when coming out to people. I've dealt with a lot of confusion, some disbelief, and even some really nasty comments and hostility from people, but never have I been encouraged by someone like this to share my identity. It felt really good!

I usually dread finals week like most college students, but now I'm actually looking forward to it. I'm still a little nervous because coming out to a room full of people and then allowing them to ask you anything about your identity is a little daunting. But I know that my professors will have my back, and I hope that by doing this I can help educate all my classmates on asexuality and perhaps a little more about queer issues in general.

Thanks for reading :

That said, I still have to figure out how I'm going to arrange the talk. I was thinking about giving a presentation with an overview of basic info and then doing a general Q A session where my classmates can ask me anything they want about my identity, although it might be good to plan some sort of activity or something to go along with it as well. I have until the end of the semester, but I gotta say I'm really excited about this, everyone! Thanks for reading :
