 I want!   I love my ST and will probably hold on to it for a few more years, so I hope the RS sticks around long enough for me to pick one up.  




 Take lessons.  Take lessons with someone that users a video camera.  I did and it was the best money I've spent on golf.  




 I actually really like it.  It keeps things new and fresh.  Plus we won't have to wait for him to (maybe) finish the books. 

It's similar to The Walking Dead, in how things are the same but different.  









 I'll probably go stage 3 Cobb, with their standard tune.  Seems like it is safe enough, from what I've tag on all the messages boards.  




 I agree.  My backseat is just an extended trunk.  I've had two single passengers back there, and it's good for them on their own, but if I had 4 people to haul, unless they were 10 or younger, I'd tell them to take a different car.   I love my ST, but I see it as a two adult, and a couple of kids, car.  Not 5 adults.  




 The aftermarket for these cars is pretty big too.  I'm waiting as long as I can (warranty) before I start to tinker with it...  I know I won't be able to hold out for the whole life of the warranty, but if I make it another year, I'll be good to go.  




 I love my ST. 




 I have a Focus ST, and love it.  Have fun!  




 Buy cars and car parts, for restoration.  




 It's a man thing.  Even men who have no idea how to work on cars, are naturally drawn to an open hood.  Doesn't really matter that it's s woman that opened it, all the man sees is an open hood.  Once they get there, they might realize that you're a woman and turn up the bullshit and creepy meter, but it was the open hood that first brought them over.  




 I'm anti government, and pro individual rights, but I'd fully support this in my neighborhood.  I do me, and you do you, as long as your thing doesn't interfere with my thing.  When it does is when we need government, and there's too many people walking their dogs and not picking up after them.  




 Go home, you're drunk.  




 Raising Arizona.   15 min into the movie before the opening credits start . 




 Don't get drunk and pass out around strangers.  Take off your shoes and go to sleep like a civilized person, asshat. 




 Did he pass out with his shoes on? Our rule was, pass out with your shoes on and you get "tagged", take them of and you're safe till you wake up.  




 No one's asking you to like old cars or engines.  Please take your opinion place else and quit trying to kill other people's buzz.  




 I would also think that as part of the interview and hiring process, they would point out the fact that the big man in black can kill you, so not to back talk him.  




 I thought I've heard that most pedophiles were sexually abused as children.  If that's the case, then it has nothing to do with how they were born, but how they were raised.  




 People who say/think, that violence is never the answer, don't realize that in cases like this, an ass beating goes a long way.  Either you get your money back, or you feel better because you just taught someone a life lesson.  




 My wife has an auto immune disease that attacks her joints (among other things). She can walk normally, but always in pain.  She doesn't show it and people give her shit all the time.  Never when I'm around.  The other day a fucking cop gave her a hard time and accused her of using someone else's window placard. 




 Alcohol  




 Yes. Life is harsh.  Don't do stupid shit, or something bad might happen to you.  Pissing of the wrong person, who knows their rights in the eyes of the law, just might be one of those bad things.  




 Ok, per street rules then.  Touch me and expect it back. Step on me, and I'll put you on the floor.  Or are you suggesting that hoodie should have just smiled and carefully moved to another desk?  




 The defense is this: I was being bullied, taunted, and harassed, then in my interpretation at the time, was attacked from behind, so I defended myself.  In fact, the whole thing got caught on tape.  Oh, she was just stepping onto the desk I was sitting at? Ok, I still defended myself.  No body has the right to decide to climb on me, without my permission.  That's the defense.  Seems pretty straight forward.  




 Point being, personal space is personal.  You breach that space uninvited at your own risk.   




 Being "attacked" by legal standards is 100% subjective.  If you poke me, and I feel threatened, I'm justified in defending myself.  




 Anyone who says they had the best days of their life in high school, I just feel sorry for.  How sad to think that someone can peek at such a young age, then have it all downhill from there.  




 If you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the legal right to defend myself.  




 The person in the hoodie got stepped on, the girl fell when hoodie moved.  And fuck that, step over me in any situation, and I'll put you on your ass.  In that situation, I was assaulted first and I defended myself.  The law is on my side, you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the right to defend myself.  




 More movies than, what?   And I've watched plenty of movies.  Not saying those are the two best movies, just two of the best endings.  If you disagree, please feel free to let me know which endings you think are better.  And if you say "The Usual Suspects" or "The Sixth Sense", or any other movie that ends in a twist, then I'll call you a cheater. ;-)  




 But how do you know that you didn't just save the bad guy?  Maybe he was part of their group and turned on them, and you just stopped some justified mob justice?  




 Try to justify it all you want, but look at your vote counter.  Your wrong and there isn't anything you can say to change that. Asshat. 




 Needs more fire.  




 Two great endings.  




 I'm 80% sure, if not, it's the second to last.  But yeah, it's the end of the film.  




 I love that movie, and that is the best part of the whole film.  Probably the best ending of any movie, next to seven. 




 Yeah, fuck that.  I'm going in.  Say shit and I'm calling the cops.  Rule of thumb, person who calls first gets the best treatment from the cops.  




 I realized how dumb I was, right after clicking "send". 




 If you're getting passed in the right lane, you're breaking the law.  Dick.  




 But if they're speaking, how is he able to tell the difference?  




 Are those like the Lincolns from the 90's?  You got to turn those off or they'll blow.  




 When ever I get asked to go to a strip club, I ask them if they want to go to an all you can eat buffet, but you can't actually eat anything...   




 It's almost like revolutionary is related to evolutionary... 




 My parents *pretty much* know.  The aunts and uncles though... 




 *smacks you with a rolled up newspaper* No! 




 Dude, you're the freaking problem.  




 It's like a grown up Highlights magazine.  Can you name them all?  80's hoopty ride in the back round, cigarettes tucked into the bra, sandals over socks, cheep domestic beer... 




 We used to have Hulu, then we upgraded to plus.  I then told my wife that I'm not paying go watch commercials.  Netflix it is.  




 Yes 




 If it is designed to have different sizes, then it's Ok.  If the engineers want something, they can pre-plan for it.  




 Correct.  Width doesn't matter (that i know of). It's all about making sure each tire travels the same distance as the others.   




 Keep with that theory, and check the organ donor box on your driver license, so at least one life will be saved...
