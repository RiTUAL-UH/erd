 You mean the quality? I know, I don't have a decent program for capturing video, and I haven't really gone through the settings. 




 I'd like to hit 10! I'm stuck at rank 13/14. Most of my success has been with Demon Zoo and Control Paladin. I also enjoy playing midrange deathrattle hunter.  Any advice on how I can advance further?

I get frustrated with face hunter and mech mage because I don't want to change decks as a simple reaction to those two decks. Or is that the inherent nature of the meta?
