 - ... hey

- Hey

- ...

- Let's get the awkward question out of the way first, shall we?

- Err, yeah, I guess...

- What're you in here for?

- A crime I didn't commit...

- Hah! That's what they all say, right?

- I don't know. I just got here.

- Murder.

- Sorry?

- Murder. That's what I'm here for. Murder.

- Murder?

- Yeah, stone-cold fucking murder.

- Shit, I err...

- That must make you a murderer, too, if they've gone and put you in here with me!

- Well... sir... with respect I didn't do anything. They didn't catch the guy and I was the only one around.

- Alright, fella. I hear you. You "didn't do it". I understand that.

- ...

- So who didn't you kill?

- I don't think... I don't think I want to discuss it with you... if you don't mind... sorry...

- Hah! Alright. We got plenty of time together anyway to discuss it. Could be useful, talking about it, you know?

- I don't think so.

- ...

- ...

- Well?

- Well what?

- Aren't you gonna ask me who I killed?

- Well, I don't think it's any of my-

- My whore wife.

- ... business...

- My *whore* wife. Fucking bitch. Caught her with another man. Came home from work early, opened the door and noticed some prick's boots by the door. 'course I didn't yell or any of that shit - didn't wanna give her time to react and make up stories. Just went upstairs, heard all I needed to hear, and waited in the bathroom.

- ... please I really don't want to hear this. I just got here and I-

- I stood in the bath behind the curtain. I waited and waited and waited.

- Please!

- Shut up! If you're gonna be with me you'd better get fucking used to it!

- I just-

- I was in the bath. After about an hour he left. Southern accent. Said he'd see her in the office. Wife's a lawyer.

- A lawyer?

- Yeah, a lawyer. Fucking property or some shit, I dunno. Who gives a shit? She's a dead fucking lawyer now.

- I just...

- Save me your stupid questions, yeah?

- Sorry...

- So she obviously needs to piss at some point, right? I don't have to wait long after he's gone. I hate waiting. I'm an impulsive guy, y'know? I don't think - I just do. So she comes in. I let her piss. Give her the satisfaction of knowing she didn't piss herself as she dies. She flushes. As the cistern fills up and the tap's running, I pull the curtain back and step out. Her reactions were quick, but not quick enough. A quick slam in to the mirror, yank her back by the hair, in to the bath. She kicks her feet but she can't do shit in the bath. She looked real fucking stupid. She knew she'd been caught. I still remember the panic in her eyes - a stare right through my gaze, looking for something inside me. "Please, please", she said, "Please don't".

- This is too much, please...

- I grabbed her throat as hard as I could and didn't stop squeezing. Her eyes bulged and everything went red... No last words... Not even a last breath.

- For fuck sake! Stop!

- Hit a nerve?

- This is bullshit... this is crazy... someone's having me on...

- No one's having you on. This is reality! People do stupid shit and people fucking die. Whores die.

- No, not... fucking hell.

- Jesus, man, I dunno why you're all wound up.

- I... I...

- Spill it. Speak!

- My wife was a lawyer. The story cut too close to the bone.

- Oh, she's a lawyer, huh? Who gives a shit?

- Please...

- So she's a lawyer, and you know what you are? A pussy.

- Excuse me?

- A PUSSY. A fucking pussy. Listen to yourself. All please this, please that, don't do this, I won't like it. Wah wah wah! Fucking cry-baby. So you killed your fucking wife.

- What?

- You said your wife *was* a lawyer.

- Yeah.

- So you killed her.

- No, I told you they didn't catch the guy. I would never hurt my wife.

- Everyone says that, until one day you catch them fucking some other bloke.

- She wouldn't...

- Why wouldn't she? Married to a pussy like you. You'd probably forgive her. Accept her stories. Take her back. No! What you need to do is stop taking shit from people. You didn't even tell anyone about Uncle Jack.

- ... w-w-what? W-who... H-how...

- You are such a fucking pussy.

- W-who... who are you?

- You really are a worthless piece of shit. I'm you.
