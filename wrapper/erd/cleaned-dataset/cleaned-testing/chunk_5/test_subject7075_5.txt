 I spent 2 weeks in Sevilla and loved every second of it.  




 Would that just be similar to a Hell's Gate, for instance?  




 I've heard of them encountering problems with the earlier firmware, but mine is up to date. So far I'm really liking it and haven't had any problems with it.  




 What's wrong with the m80? 




 With the fossil fuels shortages occurring. I know not all fossil fuels are made from dinosaurs, but still! Pretty soon there will be nothing left. 




 Okay, great - thank you!  




 If I took took it to my bike shop how much would you say that would cost?  




 Yeah I realized that as soon as I posted the picture  




 So I just purchased a vintage Peugeot SuperSport road bike. Everything is original and in great condition given its age. I took it on a test drive around the neighborhood and noticed the brakes squeal when applied and the shifting is a bit clunky. It utilizes the older, lever-style shifters that I am unfamiliar with. I am used to riding mountain bikes and decided to switch it up and use it to travel around town. 

Being that the bike isn't new - what sort of maintenance should I perform to get it to tip-top shape? 









 And it still is?
