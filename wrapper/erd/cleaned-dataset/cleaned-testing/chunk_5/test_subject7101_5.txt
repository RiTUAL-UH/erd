 beats sound like shit compared to many of the much cheaper brands

it's just it was "cool" to be seen wearing beats.. idiots easily part with money 




 he must of forgotten about the crusades 




 people still have to control and maintain them drones don't shoot missiles by themselves

besides send a drone in and if it gets shot down you lose a drone not a plane and a human 




 Nope just not a lazy grubby cunt 




 you don't own the house and should have it clean all the time

it's not hard to keep a house clean unless you're lazy 




 it's more the fact you have to go to the government and get a license which shows them you take drugs

people are not going to want to do that 




 nope i studied at tafe and paid rent it's possible to do when you have a full time job and study at night 




 a drug license wouldn't be a good idea no one is going to want to get one and will just continue to buy off dealers 




 they don't want to pay ridiculous amounts of money that we are charged for things

it's called the Australia tax for a reason

also most shows are still delayed here 




 only problem with streaming is the exclusive deals they all have

if you have netflix and x show is on foxtel you can't stream it without having foxtel as well as netflix.. then you have the other few streaming services which all have an exclusive show

piracy might have lowered a little bit but it will pick up as people don't want to subscribe to 2-3 services just to watch the shows they want 




 the war on drugs is a waste of time anywhere it's fought

it failed a long time ago yet they refuse to change tactics.. 

even America the country who started the whole war on drugs thing has realised this and some of it's states have legalised things like weed 




 greens won't get that many more votes people might hate the alp and liberals but the greens are seen as wackos by a lot of people 




 not buying work lunches is the best way to save money when i was working construction i was easily spending around 100-150 a week

all those coffees bacon and egg rolls and maccas lunches put holes in my pay

luckily i didn't smoke as well as my work mates would do the same but add a pack of smokes a day 




 yep it's easy to find work as a schoolkid at mcdonalds in fact that's the age fast food places generally want because they can pay them less then the older people

you can easily switch to part or full time after school or stay casual if you have uni and make money

it's what i did i saved thousands working 6 years at maccas while studying

my guess is some people quit after they turn 18 because they don't want to work in fast food anymore due to embarrassment or something 




 no point helping them no way to guarantee the food gets to the people instead of the military etc

besides that they have been pissing off the world with the missile tests and nuclear program and most countries are not going to want to aid them unless they agree to stop testing missiles etc 




 all thanks to the anti-vax retards

seriously whooping cough should be a thing of the past but no retards think they know better than doctors/scientists and years of medical research    




 so we should just leave them out on the streets to commit more crime? 

 




 shitloads of people do that many don't have wealthy parents either 




 don't see what will make anyone spew she worked and saved money and bought properties

any money she received from the family was wisely used instead of been pissed up the wall like most people at that age

I think the reason why people think they cannot buy property is because they want a multi-million dollar house now. Youve got to start somewhere and build it up, she said."

that is actually sound advice.. lots of people are not willing to live far from the city so prices are much higher, the further you move the cheaper it is.. the commute might suck but you'll have a cheap decent home/apartment 




 nothing shocking about it they commit crimes and are put in jail. 

most of them are re offenders and it's the reason they are in jail if they don't commit crime they won't be in jail it's as simple as that 




 the last time they adopted a "softer" approach people smugglers where having a field day

you don't want a situation where you open the boarders again and have boat after boat come here because they know we'll just take them 

all it will lead to if more deaths at sea just like last time but a lot of people seem to conveniently forget that when they cry for a softer approach  




 Hulkenberg is a good driver wasting away at a shit team i hope the guy gets a offer from a better team  




 well it's not like they could do any worse 




 they stabilize the car when it's up on the jacks if i'm not mistaken 




 2013 by far

my advice is skip every 2-3 games as they don't change enough to justify buying it every year 




 i see this game like fifa get every 2nd or 3rd one because the changes are usually only slight improvements of the graphics and the liveries/drivers of cars and maybe a tweak to handling

to me it's not worth getting every year 




 if those 4 teams all had a decent car fighting for the championship no one would be calling f1 boring

 









 back when he started health and safety wasn't as bad as it is these days

these days saftey comes before anything even if it ends up killing the sport or whatever

it's happening in every sport where they ban or restrict things that for years where fine 




 in Sydney around Gosford (around 75km from city) and even further the house prices come down considerably

some people are just not willing to live that far out of the city.. 

yes it would be a shit commute if the job was in the city but you have to buy what you can afford or you will rent forever in the city 




 most people try to fill the carry on bags with as much shit as they can if the other baggage is nearly overweight to avoid fees 




 a black market for porn would form in under a second 




 open files like music.mp3.exe 




 or they threaten legal action for defamation and the person put the site back up

what they did is actually illegal regardless if they where paid or not (the last 2 lines on the site)

 




 ^ this

very risky doing this and will likely land the person in a lot of trouble if they sue him 




 skyrim for me fell short in dialogue

a handful of voice actors for the mass amount of NPC's and even then most of the lines are recycled so you hear them a million times

the guards being a great example


 




 they should do it again and expand upon it

it was pure laziness doing it like they did in skyrim 




 might be forced retirement if he continues performing the way he is 




 having decided to play thru skyrim again one thing i hope the next game does is hire more voice actors

seriously i forgot how bad it was hearing the same voices repeated over and over again (the same lines as well), wouldn't be hard to pay a few different ones to give some variety so they don't have to recycle the voices for everyone 




 this kid should just shut up already he was in the wrong and can't admit it now is talking shit like a douchebag

the Verstappen hype is beyond annoying now and just giving this kid a big head
 









 he's not lying about the part that people will drive right past you if you're bleeding on the street

i had a bad car accident a few years back (mangled car bleeding all over the place from head injury) and at least 5-6 cars just drove right past only one stopped to see if we where ok 




 don't understand why some of the trophies are all the same colour.. why don't they at least have one gold silver and bronze

besides that they look like something that belongs in a kitchen 




 do you think the other engine manufacturers like BMW or Toyota will return to f1? 

would be good to see Williams become a works team i don't see them winning as a customer team 




 they are trying to ban it in all sports problem is that's a shitload of money out of the sports

question is who would come in and provide it 




 they still don't realise that everything they do just lures more young people to it 




 have to say black looks better than red for this car

usually i only like red Ferrari's but this one is amazing in black 




 they are biased because it's a dutch driver because i don't see torro rosso making that claim 




 proven by the data they used to penalise him grosjeans car braked 5 meters later than the previous lap

it was a rookie mistake but one he just won't admit he made 




 it's not and happens every year this type of response is the exact reason why this charity has no funding 




 hes already been proven otherwise he just doesn't want to admit he made a mistake

with a attitude like that i won't be surprised if he crashes into another wall this year 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4Dh_EAfJI

i still prefer the the sound of the v8 over the v6

 




 it's good they are addressing one of the major complaints i know it won't be v8 levels but it's better than the current lawn mowers

 




 he still can't admit he was at fault even with the data showing grosjean braked later than the previous lap

he won't learn from mistakes unless he can admit he made them won't be surprised if he crashes again this year
