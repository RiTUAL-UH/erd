 I just finished with the tenth doctor today :( I feel like I'm in mourning because I loved him so much 




 This is why I like kids. They're just so funny!

 Paint me like one of your white girls 




 You never know. She could have pudding in there just to freak everyone out. But she probably doesn't. Just look at her. Pudding? That's too smart. 




 At first glance I thought of Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny. 




 I totally thought it was wtf when it was posted THE FIRST TIME. 




 The one on the right is Chris Crocker, known for his famous "Leave Brittany Alone" video on YouTube. 




 Hello haha 




 They are featured in quite a few episodes under the ninth reincarnation of the doctor in 2005 when the show came back. I know I'm right. In the show they dealt with a specific family of Raxacoricofallapatorians called the Slitheen. 




 Post it to r/wheredidthesodago 




 Of course, no problem! I enjoy telling people. Also my name is Eli! 




 The creature is off of Doctor Who. It is called a Raxacoricofallapatorian. Link to an explanation of the creature:

 This looks more like stains from decomposing bodies. They even have human outlines. 




 Thanks. It was my best guess. I honestly just remember how much of an impact it was on the surrounding communities. 




 The Johnson's lived 30 miles away from where I grew up. President Johnson was long dead before I was born, but Lady Bird died almost 10 years back, I think back in 2004 (can't really remember). I lived in Fredericksburg, and the Johnson's in Johnson City. They attended church in Fredericksburg at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. Lady Bird was such a nice woman. One time when I was 3 years old, we were late for church. We sat in the back row, behind Lady Bird. I was being unruly, not behaving. Mrs. Johnson turned around and told my mother what a cute child I was and asked if it would be alright if I sat with her. Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the service. She loved kids. I bet she really was laying into her husband. 




 While it may be a gimmick, she really does have enormous talent. She's just gone off the deep end, let the fame get to her head (I think at least). I'm a huge Gaga fan but you have to admit it when the people you idolize and respect lose it. I saw her in concert in 2010. She really is an amazing vocalist and her piano skills are incredible. She just needs to calm it down. 




 I see where you get that and I respect that being her fan. The great thing about music is that a song that can be so small and insignificant can mean so much to someone. A lot of Adele's music speaks to me on a personal level. The music helped with a lot of heartbreak. But, music is fascinating. Songs become personal, and that's the beauty. Some people enjoy it for the tune, the rhythm, the vocals, or the words, and its all about taste. Like wine. You pick and choose until you find something you like. That's how I see it all.  




 I see no difference. In every aspect. 




 What's his porn name? 




 It's the angle of the camera... 




 I think you spelled "*I am an asshole*" wrong 




 **kill the child** 




 Same. 
**24 cents for a pack of ramen is TOO DAMN HIGH** 




 You even used the same title. What a dick. 




 Very 




 He was so attractive and handsome. 




 Sorry someone ate the chips like they were supposed to be eaten and left the ones they didn't eat in the container because they didn't want a whole lot of chips and tried to keep the left overs from getting stale? 




 Someone noticed that earlier 




 Nice little tongue twister

Or you could not scuba dive where they are? 




 Looks like my toilet after really spicy Indian food. But I love my curry. 




 Walmart does a shit job when it comes to gathering carts from their lots. Walmart is just shit. And as far as the cart crew shirts, I'm pretty sure they have them at most, if not, all stores. It's a corporate uniform. They don't really have a choice. 




 Downvote me if you want but...
*knife 




 Because Ozai is an evil dude. Why would he be nice and upvote someone? 




 Agreed 




 lulz 




 That was beautiful 




 This is one of the cutest things I have ever fucking seen. The expression in its eyes was priceless. 




 I fucking love gingers. Too bad you don't like guys. I'd be more than happy to be your valentine. Please take it as a compliment and not a comment from a creeper! 




 *Licked 




 They are. I think the person being locked though is Marcus Butler. They do a lot of videos together. 




 Jack Harries. Yum! Both he and his twin. Wish he was licking me!  









 Closest thing to a man granny has seen in years. Plus, repost. 




 I didn't know medical examiners dyed the brain when they examined. I've neer heard of that. It's cool. It made the brain look diseased though lol Do they do that often where you work? I've seen a couple autopsies but have never seen them dye it. 




 Well that fantastic for you. You go be a bigot back at them instead of being a bigger person and not giving a fuck. 




 And you think this hasn't been posted 40 times either? 




 You couldn't wait at least a day to repost it? Just go away. 




 Repost 




 Totally not a sand crab 




 This has been posted before. 









 Well, I know I'm looking at a repost 




 Oh god what the fuck is that! It looks like a caterpillar but it can't be so what is it! Oh my god!!!!1!!!!!!1!1!!!!! 




 You're the stereotype that prevents me from having straight friends. Good job. 




 -_- so. funny. 




 From the movie "The Mummy" and its also computer generated. 




 It's common knowledge. I saw a post a week back that had someone's thumb with her face drawn on it. The resemblance was uncanny. 




 That guy has been an extra in so many movies.  




 Why not laugh? 




 Oh god, that was perfect 




 Because you're not in the fucking north eastern part of the country. 




 Why do people think it a good idea to repost the same thing everyday? 




 This made my skin crawl 




 Took me a second. I thought you were implying something about a street name. Now I see. I too am "lame"... 




 "I'll meet you there a quarter past Y" 




 Whenever I see Claire Danes nowadays, all
I can think of is her playing Temple Grandin. I always expect her to talk in that way. 




 Some heavy drugs and her sexuality. 




 I remember it being a pretty popular post. A few days ago that is. 




 Is it wtf? Yes. Has it been posted a million times? Also yes. Even if you're new, I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet. 




 Am I the only one who remembers that Daleks can fly and levitate? 




 Nike doesn't advertise in other countries? 




 The underwear of course. Aw fuck it. Who am I kidding! I want all of it!  




 Want! 




 If this is your picture, why aren't you helping? Stop taking pictures and get your mouth to work. 




 ...the fuck?

 Given the right spices and seasonings, bugs probably taste good.
