 Kinda, a little, I guess? 




 As someone else who doesn't watch it, I assume there's a reason known to those who watch the show? 




 Is there anything those drows can't do? 




 Yeah, you're not alone there.  




 Aw, I had high hopes when I saw the name, but ended up skimming to the end.   
3/10, good trolling effort, poor result, will not look for more of him.  




 There is no story in the title, wtf is wrong with this fucking bot? 




 He's talking about the light, not the object emanating the light.   
My vote goes to it being real to the characters, there were several other ways he could have used to convey the awesomeness of the object, and I don't recall any other effects that wouldn't be real in-movie.  









 Loved it, I'm rewatching it now on Hulu 




 Does the app "Notification History" tell you what it is?  




 Iron Sky sequel? Awesome. 




 Well, that got incredibly annoying fast. 




 The older Roku is laggy, gotta go with the Roku 3 unless you really can't afford it. Youtube app is the worst. 




 Worth it. 




 Search Zedge or whatever ringtone app for "executive"  and "exec", that's how I find decent ones.  




 Detasseling. Riding in a basket watching the tops of corn stalks go by makes you see them even when you close your eyes after a week or two. Makes you dream of them every night as well.  




 This is what I do. I have maybe 10 movie libraries. Mostly I have them split up by type, but 4 or 5 of the same series have their own library.  




 I have my daughter on Straight Talk, iPhone, Verizon network, it doesn't use a sim card. Just depends on which phone you get. 




 Flagging sucks. Standing all day makes for an incredibly long and boring day. It's not like you can play on your phone to pass the time, and you're most always alone and away from others, so there's no idle chatting. Stand all day on the hard road and you're quickly hitting the store for better boot insoles, because your feet ache at the end of the day. 

Then there are the idiots driving. They're safe in their cars, so any thoughts of zipping close by anyone working on the road doesn't  bring any thoughts of safety to their minds. Suits and mommies chatting on their phones are the worst. They have places to be and you, you asswipe, are fucking up their day. How dare you, don't you know how important they are? You turn your sign to let them by, and off they go to try to make up as much time as possible. It's downright scary sometimes how they'll gun it to catch up to the line to get by before you turn the sign.

Fuck flagging, you couldn't pay me enough to ever do that again. 

 




 TIL you can send military tank chip info to the Chinese government and only get a $100 fine with no time served.  




 Sigh.  




 First off, it's completely against reddiquette you should be downvoted for this: fuck fanboys. 

Secondly, I had the same problem until I installed VLC and all the codecs. It must use those codecs, because suddenly it played everything. I just save new movies with plain names, and use Filebot to rename my shows. The rare instances it won't see the correct show is fixed pretty easily. Doctor Who (2005) is constantly misread, for instance, but quickly fixed manually.  




 Ugly ass things, but they are the alpha bug hunters. If you have them, it means you need them.  




 Please stop spamming my inbox with hate mail.  




 Done being a dick yet, fanboy, or are you going to keep going?  




 You're completely correct. I was a fool to entrust my music to apple.  




 I reset the defaults like you said, still didn't get that message. 

Don't be a dick. 

Edit : like the other guy said,  I guess. Still.  




 Here come the downvotes, heaven forbid anyone is unhappy with apple crap. Really just want my question answered, no need to read the rant. Asking too much, I guess. 




 It just pisses me off that itunes has me add folder to library, then links behaviors after that. It clearly distinguishes between the folder and the library, but deleted the folder with no warning. I only wanted to delete the itunes library. It's crap like that that steers me away from apple stuff, lack of user control causes unwanted results. 




 The warning says nothing about the original files being deleted. I'm looking at it right now. It says "Are you sure you want to delete the selected songs from your iTunes library? These songs will also be deleted from any iPod, iPhone, or iPad that synchronizes with your iTunes library." If the library and folder containing the music are considered the same thing, why do I need to load them in manually? Why doesn't itunes see them on start up?

edit: So, this response, which is correct, is downvoted, but what I'm responding to is upvoted even though it's incorrect? Yay for reddit, I guess. 




 My daughter went with an iphone, so we ended up putting all our music in our itunes folder, then adding it to my library. Things were all messed up (tag wise) so I spent half the day fixing and adding tags. When everything was all good, I wiped my itunes library to reload the folder. Apparently it doesn't just wipe my library, it wipes my music folder as well. When trying to delete the songs from my library, I get a warning that it will wipe the library, ipod, iphone, or ipad. NOTHING SAYS THAT MY MUSIC FOLDER WILL BE DELETED. If my itunes library was the same thing as my music folder, I wouldn't have to manually add music from the folder to the itunes library. Thousands of songs, gone. Years worth. I've undeleted with Recuva as much as possible, but tons are gone from restoring what I could from the recycle bin, which wasn't nearly large enough to hold all my files. Songs I didn't get from apple, so there's no replacing them. Some I may be able to redownload, but I'm basically forced to pirate music now, since I'm positive apple isn't about to replace anything I didn't buy from them. Gonna uninstall itunes, go with a 3rd party app, and never get another apple product again. What a huge, giant FU from apple. Well, right back atcha, guys.  




 Roku 1 w/ older Samsung tv. Same issue.  




 I had no idea about the WOL, awesome tip, thnx.  




 Ah, scraping, I get it now. I use Filebot to rename all my shows, rename movies myself, and let Plex sort it all out. I've noticed it's gotten better at figuring things out these days. Doctor Who (2005) seems to want to be renamed, but "fix incorrect" takes care of that. Oh, and Harry Potter 7 parts 1 and 2 gave me a hell of a time. Had to throw them into their own folder before they would split. Weird.  




 Would converting with Handbrake solve that?  




 I'm using Plex now, and it is indeed awesome, but I only have the one computer and don't want to leave it on all the time. 

I don't have a need to watch outside of my network. 

Converting to mp4 would take care of transcoding and scraping, wouldn't it? 




 That's fine, can always convert files.  




 edit: Ok, so Plex really is the way to go. I was using an extremely old computer as a Plex server, but it was so laggy it was unwatchable. If  I got a newer one, all I really need is decent processing power, memory, and storage to stream well, correct? I don't need to worry about a decent video or sound, seem about right? 

edit2: Found a good read about cpu requirements here: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201774043-What-kind-of-CPU-do-I-need-for-my-Server-computer-

edit3: Lots of good info, thnx guys, much appreciated.  




 Utterly awesome of you, thanks for the bill relief!  




 I could use that, I have 2 phones on Straight Talk. Just got my daughter here first phone a few months ago. 




 Nope. 




 As long as your sync is on, any additions or changes will be synced. It should automatically sync any time you change your contact list.  




 The George painting has a title too, doesn't it?  




 The coolest belt buckle ever, The Kramer, and some PCP.  









 Oh, that's what the problem is, I'm an idiot. See, I just didn't realize. Thank you for pointing that out.  




 45 but no vet. I wanted Air Force but I had an issue with my legs in high school that ruined anything for a couple decades. But my family is full of Army and Navy vets, and I'm quite proud of them all, and considering them murderers has never, ever crossed my mind.  




 Soldiers are murderers? Take that shit to the vets and their families, wonder how that will go over. You have any loved ones who are vets? Did you disown them for the murderers you believe them to be? And while I'm not a gun nut, there are legit reasons for guns. They're just plain fun to shoot. Most folks I know around here have them, they all hunt and eat what they kill. I'm not into it, but if they want to eat pheasant, more power to them.  




 Pretty obvious you haven't got much experience with the real drug world. Innocents suffer every day due to the whole mess. Not everyone gets a choice whether or not they associate with them, and often times are completely unaware they are. My sister's best friend in school was killed because her father was in it. She had no idea about anything. 

And war, as horrible as I believe it to be, is the natural state of affairs. Has there ever been a time in history when it wasn't? Are they all necessary? No. The Iraq war wasn't, I think. But when groups like ISIS or the Nazis rise up, evil will only triumph when good men do nothing. Did more people die in WWII than would have died had Hitler had gone unchecked? 

But all that stuff aside, I still would prefer a children's toy store didn't sell drug dealer toys.  




 I see your point, but we've grown up with that stuff. And I've never seen a gun pusher standing on a corner. How  can you have more of a problem with playing soldier than playing drug dealer?  




 WTF are you talking about. It's a kid's store. How many commercials have you seen that didn't target kids? 

Btw, they were put alongside gi joe and super Mario bros figures.  




 Ok, I wasn't expecting much, but that is one of the funniest youtube videos I've seen in a long time. Is this a tv show?

"I HOPE YOUR MOM GETS ASS WARTS!" 




 ...for a rapist? 




 You can't? 




 Toy R Us is selling fake bags of meth, and they defend it. What world am I passing off to my daughter... 




 Oh dear lord, don't tell me those dumbass legwarmers are a thing now.

edit: So I just asked my white trash baby's momma about these, she's seen them. Kids, en mass, have no taste. 




 On the left.  




 "Does not require any special permissions." 

Good Guy Dev 




 WiFi?  




 They claim to do a better job of cleaning if done while standing up.  




 Best ______ ever. 

Bugs me to no end.  




 Yet another has learned the true value of syncing and backups the hard way.
