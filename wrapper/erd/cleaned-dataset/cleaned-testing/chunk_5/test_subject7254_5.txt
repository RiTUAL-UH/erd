 Nice try, but I'll believe hours of video over one staged shot. 




 So Redditors now support blackmail of elected officials if it advances their agenda?

When Anthony Weiner did this, it was 'his own private life'.

Hypocrisy abounds among the naive Reddit 'intelligentsia'. 




 Republicans receive money from rich Americans for political favors -- Reddit Outrage

Democrats receive money from rich foreigners for political favors -- Reddit Silence 




 Would you rather be in the middle of a sporting event riot or a Baltimore/Ferguson riot?
 









 Not even close.

Were the UK fans beating up innocent blacks for fun?
Gangs are viciously attacking people in Baltimore because they are white. 




 "Oh she's such a great mom!  She's a hero!"

No she's not.  She's doing what a mother should do. 




 Too bad he is not trusted by his masters in the Maryland state government with a firearm to defend his livelihood. 




 Are our standards so low for black males that we elevate a man for simply opposing violence against police?  Why are we fawning over something that is simply what good citizens do?  Because he's black?  If he was white, would this be a thing?

All able-bodied men should be standing up to the criminals in Baltimore, Ferguson, etc. 




 It's not a riot. 

It's a celebration of diversity. 




 Will the mayor continue to 'give space' to these criminals? 



















 The Clinton familys mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid, notes the New York Post. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends."

Color me shocked. 
























 Congratulations.  You've found the difference in incentive betwen the government and private sector.

A business operates off its own money and thus has the incentive to perform and be accountable.

The government doesn't operate off it's own money and the employees do not have any motivation to be accountable or even perform at all.

 




 And Democrats want to put these people in charge of our health services. 




 Ignorant liberal outrage against Nestle.

Nestle responds, shutting down operations, laying off people and moving out of state.

Ignorant liberal outrage against Nestle.  




 You do realize that George Bush has not been President for 7 years? 














 Do you approve of donations from a Russian company to the Clinton foundation while Hillary signed off on uranium rights for that **exact same company**?

If this is a popular stance, to condone corruption of one party, this country is in trouble. 




 Can someone explain to me why a random company in Russia would donate to the Clinton Foundation? 




 Liberals want "money out of politics",  provided that money is not foreign money going to the Clinton Foundation to influence policy decisions. 




 This is not a valid reason for not sending fixed wing air support as there would be very little risk to the pilots.

Again, why was no force ordered to support the surrounded force on the ground?
Why was no force ordered to spin up *at all*?

This fight went on **all night long**. For those hours and hours no one was ordered to even simply get ready to go in. 




 "Several press reports surfaced Thursday saying Clintons department signed off on the sale of uranium rights in the U.S. to a Russian company, while the Clinton Foundation was receiving donations from that company. President Bill Clinton was also given a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia."

Outright corruption to anyone with common sense.

Head-turning and excuses from the liberal Reddit intelligentsia.
 









 Obama and Holder will not rest until they find the white Tea Party member responsible. 









 There has not been a comprehensive report released yet.

Gowdy's report will be just that. 




 Your reasoning fails basic logic.


If you call the fire department and tell them your house is on fire, they will never say "It will take too long to get there and your house will be burned down by then, so we won't come at all."

No force was *ever* sent.  Why?
 




 Here is the Democrat playbook for scandals.

1. Deny, stonewall, deny, stonewall, etc.
2. When evidence finally surfaces in spite of Democrat obstruction, say "it happened a long time ago."

Sorry Obama, Hillary and Carney....the truth is timeless. 




 All of these attacks took place in sovereign nations with responding security forces.  In these cases, unilateral intervention would be more difficult politically.  Libya, however, was in a state of civil war and unilateral action would have been the *only* security response.

Who is the only one person in the USA who can authorize military action in another nation?

Why was no rescue force ever sent while our people were in a siege and getting killed?

Why were fixed wing aircraft resting on a tarmac one hour away(Italy) never scrambled?

We did however manage to send an *unarmed* Predator.  Why did we prioritize the launch of an unarmed Predator over fixed wing assets with real bombs?

Why was the attack blamed on a video despite there being no evidence of this?

How did the White House/media know **immediately** the motivations of attackers in the middle of the night 8,000 miles away in a war torn country?  What source did they use for this?  Did they interview people?  How did they know this?

Why was a low ranking person, Susan Rice, paraded out on talk shows to blame this attack on a video?  Why not have someone that is formally in charge actually address the nation first?

TLDR: Our men fought all night long, while no one in Washington lifted a finger. The White House made up a story about a video, since this was mid-election and a terrorist attack would have been bad for Obama.

 Another inefficient federal program running in the red?

Color me surprised. 









 Give yourself small rewards for small attainable goals.

 What would happen if you moved out of your mom's basement? 














 Barack Obama's illegitimacy to be President of the United States of America. 




 That's life. It's not fair.

When you stop blaming your problems on the "rich" bogeyman, you'll start sleeping better.

Take responsibility for your own situation.  No one else is holding you down. 




 Why do you believe you have a right to money that someone else has earned and already paid taxes on? 




 The estate tax is wildly unfair double taxation.

Another "hey you're rich and we don't like that so we will make separate laws for you" moment from the Democrats. 




 Because Americans were being actively overrun and Obama purposely didn't lift a finger. 




 Muslims are just so peaceful. 














 "more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline around the time the project was being debated in the State Department."

Goodbye Hillary.
 









 Ohh those evil corporations are so corporationey.

Go get laid. 









 You mean we don't have a junior state senator with no leadership experience who dislikes white people?
We have many viable candidates. What we don't have is cover from the media.
 




 You mean one guy saying it vs an entire crowd chanting? 



















 Foreign relations 101.

 Please show me where our President lobbied for North Korea to build nuclear weapons. 




 Iran has explicitly said they will "destroy Israel". 

Intelligence gathering is now complete. 




 "The Obama administration has taken a position weaker than the U.N. Security Council.

Ouch.  So it's not even a harsh letter. 









 It's hardly a kneejerk but is a stance founded in the principle of equal treatment of all. 

You want to treat children differently because of their race.  

You are telling them they need extra special treatment because of their inherent race.  I'm sure that does wonders for their self-esteem.

Affirmative Action tells people they can't do it without help and in America that's bullshit.
 




 This is a public school, not a private business. 




 Anything to keep them busy so they don't invade half the world again. 














 Brought to you by the Muslim Student Association and Muslim Brotherhood. 









 They're just so peaceful. 




 It is highly unethical for a Secretary of State to run a private charity that takes donations from foreign governments.  Can you say conflict of interest? 




 Why not discuss the topic of the article? 




 A Democrat does something unethical.  Reddit looks the other way and attacks the source. 









 Let me know how your campaign to ban "non-factual garbage opinion" goes. 




 You're right.  Let's ban dissenting views.  /s 




 How many wars will a military comprised of atheist Reddit hipsters be able to win? 














 GM should have been allowed to fail, and we should have never experimented with the federal govt owning a car company.

We lost 10 billion on the stock and now this.
