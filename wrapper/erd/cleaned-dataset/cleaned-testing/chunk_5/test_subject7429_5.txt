 At the end of last year in place of the ever popular Hchste Kaiser's Word, there was a live showing of the execution of the show's news team. Before the execution, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 explained to the people that the news team was being punished after the discovery that they were stealing classified information and supplying it to the terrorist group currently at large and killing Liechtenstein's citizens. The execution was done by pistol and carried out personally by the nation's leader. After the execution he stated that betrayal to the country in any form will not be tolerated. 




 At this point just asking would be more unique than anything else. 




 Jesus, for a second I thought he was. 




 Well I feel silly. I meant to add something to the post before submitting it. 




 Liechtenstein is doing nothing. We had no property in space. 

In other news, the terrorist cell currently attacking unarmed civilians and government buildings has begun spreading its demands across the Internet. They are calling for a stop to the construction of the Wall and reopening of the nation's borders. The group claims to be making these demands in order to stop what they foresee to be a rapid downfall in the country's economy that they fear will have a large and irreparable effect on Liechtenstein's people. The still nameless group had threatened to continue the attacks until their demands are met. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has yet to make a public acknowledgement to the terrorists' demands.

Edit: forgot stuff 




 Liechtenstein welcomes you. We have sent a fruit bouquet in hopes of peaceful relations from now on. 




 Yeah, the Ajax near my house is selling a couple really cheap. 




 "Stay out."

~Hchste Kaiser, /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein wishes for a public execution competition. 




 Fucking do it 




 Our ancestors were right. We'll protect this secret with our lives. 




 Aw man. Well, thanks for letting me know. 




 Hchste Kaiser will attend your silly convention. 




 If you could please clear the confusion on the shape of the Earth, Liechtenstein would be most appreciative. 




 ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 When I last saw them Caleb had disappeared into the crowd and someone from the crowd got on stage and finished I Have A Problem. It was pretty great. 




 I've seen them twice now and let me just say that they are the only opening band I've ever seen with so much enthusiasm. They got the entire room moshing. It was fantastic. 




 No problem. I'll wait. My bad. 




 We'd love to continue the service. 




 Liechtenstein might be willing to pay for Sealand's mail service to continue of it's in Great Britain's best interests. 




 Thanks for looking out for me ;) 




 [Meta] Thanks! [Meta] 




 [Meta] Yeah, I'm just having fun with this. And of course, if it ever becomes a nuisance, I'll set her free. 




 Liechtenstein would like to send diplomats to the micro nation of Sealand to discuss annexation as a strategic base. Since its leadership has gone quiet for over a year since claiming the territory, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 assumes that it is now open to new leadership and, because of it's size, wouldn't count as a full country in regards to annexation. 

Liechtenstein withdraws its attempted negotiations with Austria for annexation of one of its territories. 




 Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to help with the relief efforts. They're trained for all manner of emergency situations beyond just combat. 




 In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks. 

The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning. 

Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.  




 I was on a tricycle and a friend and I were rolling down a neighbor's driveway into another neighbor's lawn to slow down. Long story short, my shitty trike was nothing on her Big Wheel and I had no helmet. The grass didn't slow me down enough and the front wheel hit a rock. I flipped over the handle bars and hit my head on the rock and blacked out. Then I saw one of my neighbors running toward me yelling my name. Blacked out. Blood on the sidewalk. Blacked out. My front door. Blacked out. Then it was the next day. Tricycles make me nervous now. 




 Beautiful 




 Our eternal leader, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the bass guitar the national animal of Liechtenstein. They are now government protected creatures under the guidelines set by the newly passed Godly Rythm Act of 2020. All citizens will treat bass guitars from here on out with reverence, love, and the utmost respect or risk public execution. That is all. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a fruit bouquet as a welcome back gift. Just know that they aren't  actual flowers, but fruit under the guise if flowers. We hope you enjoy the fruit man's ruse. 




 I live here and didn't know that! 




 (I was busy yesterday)

Hchste Kaiser's third year as the supreme general of our great nation has been quite eventful. An attempted terrorist attack took place at the capital building while Hchste Kaiser was meeting with all of his officials. Luckily, the explosive malfunctioned and wasn't able to detonate. Turkey was able to supply intelligence that told us that this isn't a single man's idea, but a group effort. The terrorist is still being interrogated for information.

On a brighter side, our great leader recently started a new program for the military elite. The SHIT program will include the best if the best soldiers from both Liechtenstein and France. These SHIT Squads will be used as Hchste Kaiser's personal guard and in missions considered to dangerous for the average soldier or police officer. Hopefully, once the program releases the first groups from training, a terrorist attack like the one mentioned will become much more difficult to execute.

In more recent news, our wonderful leader sent delegates to the Vorarlberg region of Austria to negotiate an annexation. If Austria's own annexation of another area comes to fruition, then Vorarlberg may well become the newest addition to our great nation. These negotiations also led to an alliance between the two countries.

In other news, the construction of the Wall is going as planned, but, sadly, the **subway station's** construction has been haulted until further notice. And finally, Texas finally gave Hchste Kaiser his money back. When asked about the country's new leader, /u/test_subject7429's only response was, "Who? Oh, s***! I'm late for my banjo lessons. Get out!"

This concludes your only choice in yearly news. We thank you for choosing Hchste Kaiser's Word, even though you have no other option.

 Batman   Robin isn't the worst movie. It's just really, really bad. 




 Excellent! Good luck, for both of our sake! 




 We think that would be a great idea. 




 Whatever you choose, Liechtenstein respects the decision. 




 Thanks for considering. We understand if you'd like to keep the land. 




 Liechtenstein would be willing to donate $10B to help with the project. We are also willing to help train pilots and design weapons systems for the ships if needed. 




 Hchste Kaiser wishes to expand, fearing that the small size if our already great nation is a weakness. If Vorarlberg will allow it, we will welcome them into our arms as a new addition to our country. 




 This information is concerning. Thank you for sharing this. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in helping with this project, if you'll have us.

~Hchste Kaiser 




 Signed

~Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Recently there was an attempt on the Hchste Kaiser's life. During a meeting with his parliament, a large car rammed itself through the front doors of the building and the driver attempted to detonate an explosive in the vehicle. Thankfully, the explosive didn't detonate and the bomber was captured. He is currently in custody and being questioned. Hopefully this was an individual attack and not a group effort. Any information will be extremely appreciated.  




 Liechtenstein would be honored to have France's legendary soldiers take part in the SHIT program. 




 Today, our great nation begins a program that will not only ensure our land's protection, but help efforts all over the world. This day marks the beginning of the Special Hunt and Infiltrate Trooper training program for the country's most elite military personnel. This elite team of soldiers will have the newest in prototype military technology and have the best training the country can offer. This is a great step forward for Liechtenstein's military and a great day for our country! 

Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Hchste Kaiser will make an appearance. The yeti menace has terrorized the great nation of Liechtenstein for far too long. 




 I'm a a pretty big fan of Mike Litoris, myself. 




 I completely agree with you. I don't know what it is, but I find that the more affordable cars are a lot more interesting. 




 I wish they'd had the other characters you'd unlocked around the city fighting crime or something. That would've been badass. 




 With the return of Liechtenstein's money, the construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein will begin as planned in January of next year. However, without the help of the former dictator of Texas, a completion date is still unknown. But do not worry, people.  The continuity of this great nation is still of utmost importance to me.

Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Thank you very much. 




 Return Liechtenstein's money and I will consider making an appearance at your silly concert. 




 Does Matt Greiner play guitar? 




 This year has been a stressful one for the great leader of Liechtenstein. The panic cause by the meteorite impact in Northern Africa forced Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 to close the border to all but the most important persons and events. Despite the crisis being solved, the leader remains cautious and has yet to reopen the borders to the rest of the world.

In other news, a **subway system** began construction. Everyone is extremely excited for the **subway** and hopes to be able to **travel the country quickly and in comfort** soon. Sadly the **subway** does not yet have a definite completion date, but stay tuned! 
(*Disclaimer*: **subway system** is definitely **not** a military bunker.)

On the topic of construction, the leader of our great nation also began construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein. This wall will surround the entire country and be fully armed with soldiers, artillery, etc. Sadly, did to the recent change in leadership in Texas, the previously expected help in building the wall seems to no longer be the case. This unexpected delay has caused this project, too, to no longer have an expected completion date.

On a related note, Hchste Kaiser expects Texas to, "Give me my money back. Like, now, guys. I mean... Come on."

Lastly, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the raspberry as Liechtenstein's national fruit. All citizens are now required to consume at least one raspberry every 6 hours in accordance with the laws set by the recently passed Freaking Delicious Act of 2018.

This concludes your once a year news source Hchste Kaiser's Word. Tune in next year for your only choice in Liechtenstein news!

Stay tuned for Sing-Along Disney Songs with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Why have I seen this same story in different formats so much these last couple of weeks? 




 Due to the recent change in leadership in Texas and unrealistically enthusiastic deadlines by our great leader, the **subway** that was planned no longer has a definite completion date. We **apologise to the citizens** and **hope they will be able to ride the rails** sooner than later.

Hchste Kaiser's Minister for Expansion 




 Yeah, that was just me being enthusiastic more than anything. It'll definitely be a while. 




 Either Notch or Lived a Lie by Codec 




 Oh, it definitely is **legit**. 




 Liechtenstein has begun construction of an underground **subway.** This amazing **transportation system** will run throughout the entire country and **be able to transport the citizens of Liechtenstein all over the country**! This is **in no way** a military base or a vault or anything of the sort! As a sneak peak, I am willing to say that the new **subways** will feature extremely large 3 ft thick gates that will stand around 20 ft high and be able to be withstand even the most powerful of **train collisions**! Isn't that fantastic? The **subway system** will also be going hundreds of feet below ground with multiple levels to **allow for more trains and routes**! Wow! To give you people an idea about the size, it may or may not be able to hold the majority if not all of the citizens of Liechtenstein in the event of a great **celebration** so everyone will be able to **party together**! Amazing! We anticipate that this **subway system** will be complete in a matter of 3-4 years and then **everyone** will be **allowed** to **ride the trains all over the country**!

 Liechtenstein 




 Holy shit. The fez thing. I know someone that wears one every day.  




 Ohmigawd you guys so I was on tumblr and everything they said even the stupid way they type without punctuation as if they were yelling and never taking a breath is just crazy and I'm literally dyING YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW 




 That has to be one of the shortest ever. I swear it lasted all of 3 days. 




 Wonderful. I've sent the funds. 




 Sir, you have your self a deal. Maybe we can even go one step further... And build both. 




 Preposterous. I won't pay a penny over $98M 




 Hmm, how large of a fee? 




 After reports of a multitude of people secretly entering the great nation of Liechtenstein despite the heavily enforced closed border rulings, I have decided that in order to keep the peace and integrity and ensure the defense and safety of this perfect nation and its citizens, a barrier must be built. The wall will stand 50 feet tall, be heavily defended, and surround the entire nation. This decision is not one made easily, but must happen in order to ensure the safety of my nation and its people in these unpredictable times. 

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Social experiment? 




 Well... That's awkward because he's... Ah... Dead. 




 The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.

As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.

In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.

That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.

 All travel into Liechtenstein is hereby suspended indefinitely. Only people with top clearance will be allowed across the border and only when it is absolutely essential that they be allowed into the country. 

Liechtenstein also offers financial aide to help with researching/combating the new bacteria.

 If you could change that, I would be forever grateful. 




 Awesome. Thanks! 




 How's "Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein"? 




 Lichtenstein wholeheartedly accepts the offer! 




 Lichtenstein hopes the parties are fantastic. 




 Lichtenstein offers a party planner instead. 




 Liechtenstein hopes you understand. 




 From here and on, all citizens 16 and older will receive basic military training in preparation for any evident military threats against this great nation.

 The country of Liechtenstein thanks you and in return would like to send a shipment of posters depicting the Alps (36"x12"/91.5cm x30cm). We hope this is the start if a wonderful friendship. 




 Actually, I'm really sorry if you already did it, but

Hchste Allgemeinen fr die Ewigkeit

Would be nice.

Edit: I'm perfectly happy if you can't/don't want to. 




 Are they bright? 









 All glory to Supreme Liederstein! 




 Honestly, there's always seemed to be this huge anti religion thing in the genre. And it's a little weird. 




 There's a whole sub if you didn't know!
