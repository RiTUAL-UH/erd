 It took a lot of research, trial, and error before I finally landed upon two pieces of tape for my design. 




 What kind of monster just throws stamps on willy nilly like that? 




 That appears to be a piece of wood with a hole cut in it. 














 Where is this? The Sweden store?

Never have I seen a store with so much Sweden merchandise. 









 In that case I am definitely letting /u/EASummer do this item for our team.

 The prompt is at least 6 arrows...

These are triangles, but I suppose they are intended to be interpreted as arrows. I'm going to vote this up, but I'll let the other judges vote as well. 









 Step 1: Write a positive review for a vegan restaurant, organization, or business that you like.

Step 2: Get a direct link to your review or take a screenshot of your review (removing any personal info) and upload it to imgur.

Step 3: Submit your link to /r/SummerScavengerHunt with the title "#246 Write a positive review for something."

 [In the last week, 7 of the 20 most popular submissions on this subreddit are from me](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/top/?sort=top t=week). It is really insulting when you act like I am not an equal part of this subreddit despite the fact that I am contributing the most popular content.  




 I'm voting this up, but I'm going to let the other judges vote on it before awarding points since I can imagine there might be some debate over whether to consider a parking structure a building. 









 I see a bell, and that looks enough like a tower. I'll let the other judges vote on this, but I am voting this up. 




 I vote this down. This does not meet the criteria specified in the prompt. 









 Done 













































































































 Yeah, you seemed to suffer a lot less than /u/EASummer did in his video. 




 Don't they ask you to turn off all electronic devices a few minutes before this?

 My physics professors would say that mass and weight are not the same thing, but I'm going to give you credit anyway. 




 Can't you copy the text from the list and paste it into an Excel or Google doc? 









 I vote down. The prompt does specify partner, and they do have a partner. I'm sure they will find another opportunity to sneak up on their teammate with a clothespin. 




 Meh is not a vote. 

I vote down. If I was asked I would not say that woman is wearing a green shirt. 









 That was really well made. Have you ever considered becoming a professional connect-the-dots designer? 




 They said they work on a farm with thousands of pigs. It is a straight up factory farm. 












































 Nope, just start submitting things you find to the subreddit. 





























 Plus add on top of that the whole correlation is not equal to causation thing.

Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Yes, you need to pay attention to what you eat in order to make sure you are eating healthy, but that is the case regardless of whether or not you are vegetarian.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 Are you subscribed to /r/vegetarian? 




 Don't let the negative comments bother you. Veganism isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of anything relating to kingdom animalia. It is about minimizing the harm our actions cause to animals as much as possible and practicable. If an animal does not possess the neurological capacity to be harmed in any meaningful sense then it is perfectly vegan to use/eat it. 




 You still haven't scored my Gofro book or voted on the other unscored items. 




 I think the doorstop that /u/shuxue posted made a better noise.

I'm guessing that I'm going to be an expert on coil doorstop sounds by the end of this summer's scavenger hunt.

 Reddit has great communities at /r/vegan and /r/veganrecipes.

[ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is also very helpful if you are trying to move in that direction. 




 Tons of meat-free foods are fortified with vitamin B12, and a supplement costs less than 5 cents per day. This is not a difficult burden to overcome. 




 Lesson: Don't look to lions for your ethics. 




 Done
 




 They are also individuals whose lives have value independent of the benefit they provide to us, but from the cold, heartless perspective of the dairy industry your statement is accurate. 










































































 No need to apologize! We want people to go vegan and stay vegan! 




 Yeah, I probably should have mentioned that a lot of it is pretty depressing to watch. 




 [Here's a talk by Adriano Mannino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aa6g1y4l8I) (one of my favorite philosophers) on reducing wild animal suffering. 









 I think you have the wrong idea of this post. I do not run Action For Animals. I am not trying to get into modeling. There is nothing that I stand to gain from this. Even if it was self promotion, given the amount of other material I contribute to reddit it would easily fall within what is allowed under the reddit rules. 




 Sounds like somebody can't believe it's not butter. 




 When you're on Tour I expect you to post pictures of yourself modeling the shorts to /r/vegan. 




 EU countries import 35 million tons of soy beans and soy meal from north and south America every year - to use as feed for pigs, chickens and cows.

Cultivation of primarily genetically modified soy for export uses land in developing countries that could go toward sustainable agriculture.

But even in industrialized countries like Germany, globalized industrial livestock farming presents a pollution problem.

"[Animal waste] is the root of considerable environmental problems in Germany, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming," explained agrarian economist Knut Ehlers of the German Environment Agency.

Although manure is also a fertilizer, too much is toxic for soil and water. The environmental impacts of factory farming "ultimately fall on the taxpayer," said Ehlers.

Such agriculture is unsustainable, Ehlers stressed. He hopes that aiming more public attention to the issue of soil depletion on the national and EU levels will lead to more sustainable policy-making, and development of organic agriculture.

[Source](http://www.dw.de/loss-of-fertile-soils-a-food-security-risk/a-18395856)

Plant farms are taking on a part of the issue of the overwhelming amount of excessive manure and waste generated by animal agriculture, and yet you are trying to throw them under the bus for not being entirely self-reliant? We have many other fertilizer options available. Be grateful that these farms take on some of the waste that you create. 




 Shh... Don't tell the NSA. 




 So I can't actually give the shirts (or shorts) out for free, but if you like any of the stuff I am modeling they are available [here](http://store.afa-online.org/home.php) and the money you spend goes to supporting a great animal rights group.

If you're going to any of the US Warped Tour shows they will also be available there. 

















































 As a utilitarian, I am going to say that the action would be justified if the benefit to you exceeds the harm to animals, and if it is the available option that maximizes the benefit and minimizes harm.

I think you would be hard pressed to find many real-world scenarios where raising animals oneself or hunting them in the sense that you are likely imagining would meet those criteria. However, I will say that hunting oysters, which are animals with very limited nervous systems as adults, could very well be justified. 




 You went from a bad justification to a terrible justification. It is not okay to pay people to abuse animals and slaughter them just because you enjoy it. You need to take into account both your enjoyment as well as the harm your actions cause to others in order to make an ethical decision.

The food chain is not an ethical theory (and you won't be any more likely to get eaten by other animals if you choose to eat less meat). 

There is no reason to say reactionary nonsense just because you don't like what /u/The_Same_Sun was saying. 









 [Could you use something like the image on this page](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/foundational-research/number-of-animals-vs-amount-of-donations/)? 




 I'm glad it is staying vegan. Soylent is so incredibly convenient, but I can't justify buying anything with animal products.

 You're just making things up about animals. Plenty of animals possess very complex minds and social interactions. We have very strong reason to think many of them recognize that they are in captivity and much more.  




 [Here is a speech by philosopher Adriano Mannino at the University of Zurich on reducing wild animal suffering](http://adrianomannino.com/en/project/reducing-wild-animal-suffering/) that I think addresses your question. 




 /r/summerscavengerhunt

This year's competition just started today and runs through the end of August. Anyone can join. It is a ton of fun! 




 So if great apes could be taught American sign language, or if parrots had been taught to speak as well as human children, or if dolphins called each other by name and spoke over underwater telephones, or if we had identified words in prairie dog language that communicate shape, size, color, and species of individuals then you would treat them with respect?

At the same time not all humans possess language or higher reason. There are young children, the severely mentally handicapped, the elderly and senile. Should we treat them as property and say their rights end where their owner says so? 




 Humans are animals, and the idea of what ethically relevant criteria should separate humans from non-human animals is one that has been debated for millennia and pushed back time and time again.  




 The Summer Scavenger Hunt is a friendly competition that is now underway and will continue through the end of August. In order to participate just find and document (with pictures or video) items from the list below and then post them to this subreddit to be awarded points.

First thing first, [read the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/SummerScavengerHunt/wiki/rules).

Now that you have done that (You had better not have just read on to this section without reading those rules) here is the [list for the 2015 Summer Scavenger Hunt](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sh7a7gfm1jjCIHsCsERSw1p1MPS5ePpdO2x7KpMXZCY/pubhtml)!

Both of these links may also be found in the sidebar along with the current scores and additional info in the Scavenger Hunt Wiki. New players and teams may join at any time. All you need to do to get started is to find an item or complete a task from the list and post the picture or video you recorded of it to this subreddit. What are you waiting for, get searching!

Are you on the internet?! Cavemen didn't have that, should probably distance yourself from that wicked wifi signal.

This is a complete strawman argument. /u/anthonyharriet isn't saying we ought to live like humans did thousands of years ago. They are saying that the amount of meat the typical person (in the first world) eats today is well above what is considered healthy. 




 You're not less guilty if you pay someone else to do it for you.
