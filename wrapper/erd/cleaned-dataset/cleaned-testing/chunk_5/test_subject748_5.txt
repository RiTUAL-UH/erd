 Hey Redditors,

I've been working on a book for the better part of a year now, and i wanted to show off the main characters and get some feedback regarding them. The basic plot is that death has stopped working and the five protagonists have to find out why before the world ends.

I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.

Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is useless in a physical fight.

Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing. He sucks at hand to hand and relies on trickery and dirty tactics to win.

Daniel- I know he's a young swordsman, but I need help for him in terms of personailty and quirks

Kara is a young woman who is raised by dwarves. As a result, she is capable of defending herself in hand to hand combat and is the only party member who is able to hold off multiple opponents single handily. However, while she is a badass, Kara isn't very good in social situations and due to the dwarven tradition of judo throwing people as a way of saying 'hello', this leads to some really awkward situations.

Felix is the grim reaper's teenaged and amnesiac apprentice. He is the voice of reason in the cast and tries his best to guide the them in the right direction. As the apprentice of Death, he is capable of teleporting and entering the realm of the dead. Despite the fact that he wears a skull mask, he's a nice guy. 




 Hey Redditors,

I think I might be a low level empath. Whenever there's an argument around the house or I talk to someone with high levels of emotion, I pick up on how they're feeling and 'acquire' it to my own mental state. For example, if my mom is angry, I become unhappy. I've tried shutting this off, but I can't seem to. Some times this can be great, like when I'm talking to girls, I can pick up on 'vibes' and say the right things, but other times, when in an argument, this is bad. Any suggestions on what to do?  




 Yeah, as a little feedback, I don't care about credentials! I'm not an employer, I'm a reader. I need to know if this character likes chocolate ice cream, or if his wife died and started his path to being a hero or even if he's secretly gay! Tell US about THEM personally. You need to know these characters inside and out. 




 Hey Redditors,

Just wondering, is there a separate subreddit for character feedback, or can I do it here? I don't want to seem to egotistical.

Thanks, much love!  




 Hey Redditors,

I want to make a Minecraft Machinima, but I don't know how. I work on a Mac, and I only have one computer.

Thanks
 




 I could see Turps or Strippin as golems, Fiona as a shape shifter and Strife as a Griffin. 




 On second thought, I'll just make the world with multiple biomes, but a very large jungle region along the Equator 




 It's the same size as earth. 




 Oh wow. I'm not much for climatology, but thanks man, I'll add some more biomes then. 




 Nice work! I personally would've chosen wolves or otters, but I made the post, so I figured it would be in bad taste.  




 Interesting! Very Tarzanish! 














 The idea is that having archenemy is easy in a world where superhumans exist. Forming rouges galleries would be made simple through the app. Also, I wanted that whole ,'borderline in a committed relationship' that some superheroes like Batman have with some of their enemies. And The Quake and Screech will eventually develop that overtime. 




 It wasn't that I was a bad superhero. I'd fought criminals, like Big Figure, Crag and Crowbar. But I didn't have a arch nemesis like my friends. I knew that getting an arch would propel me into superhero stardom, but I just couldn't get a break. So I turned to the internet, a phone application called Find-a-Nemesis. I met a guy around my age, 19, named Mathis. After we got to know each other, we agreed to go meet in person. 

I stood at the door of the apartment as it was wrenched open by a heavy set teenager wearing a pink t-shirt with a cartoon pony on the front. His face was covered in acne and his glasses were perched on his greasy nose, over a cheap black mask that hardly stretched over his face. A red cape was tied around his neck and he wore a pair of matching gloves that went up to his elbows. 

"Hey are you Mathis?" I asked, hoping that this was his fanboy brother. Not that I was picky, but I didn't think this guy could even walk a mile, let alone withstand one of my sonic screams. He scowled at me.
"I am Mathis." he annouced with a heavy lisp. "And I assume you are Wyatt, AKA, The Screech." My heart fell. This guy is my arch? Damn it. "I was expecting someone at little more- you know- capable of putting up an impressive fight." I said sheepishly. Mathis grinned, showing me a row of yellow stained teeth. He flexed his flabby arms and glared at me. After a minute of awkward silence, the ground began to shake. 
"Um, is that it?" I asked. Mathis nodded. 
"You have felt the power of... THE QUAKE!" I groaned.
"No." I said. "I can find someone better for the job, thanks though." I turned and began walking down the street. I opened the Nemesis app and turned on the locator. 'No new nemesis's in your area' it read. Damn. I turned back to Mathis.  
"Ok, fine. I guess your my arch. Let's make this quick." 




 No, Patrons can tell who is a another patron and who isn't. Plus a lot of their meat comes from the dinosaur-like creatures. 




 I'm thinking that the type of magic is going to be exclusive to your patron animal with the exception of deity boons. For example, a lion shapeshifter would have a ability to enhance their strength for a amount of time, but the a lioness priestess could call for a certain god's help in battle for whatever.     




 There are other varying climates, but a large part of the world is jungle and rainforest. 




 Nope. No one is 'normal'. Unless i decide to make a story where that is the case. 




 They prey on the week. Interesting.  




 This will be a book series. I just need ideas for how each race, (black, white, asian) could be represented. The overall goal for the world is to make it as cool as possible while being as relatively realistic as I can be with magic and shapeshifters. And there is a sort of 'Republic' like the Roman Empire that's important.     




 Hey Redditors, 
I had an idea for a world where every biome is a jungle, baring the poles. The people have the ability to become their patron animal, like a jaguar, parrot, river dolphin ect. Dinosaur-like creatures also exist. I need your help because I'm not sure where to take this concept .  




 Pantaria used to have a Magocractic council. Unfortunately, after two hundred years of the chaotic and an ultimately unproductive rule, it was dissolved but has been reformed twenty years before the events of the series. The magocracy was and still is corrupt, run by a lazy and idiotic council of wizards and a few sensible witches. People generally don't care about the council, as everyone knows that only a major event would get them to agree on anything. The only thing stopping the mages from doing whatever they want is food. All council members have four feasts a day, and are so fat, they need levitation chairs to get around. They don't care about anything but their own political agenda, and will fiercely defend it, often times to the death. The council members will usually be either top graduates of prestigious magic academies, be the sons or daughters of former council members, or just kill their way into a council seat.  




 I slammed the door to my apartment and bolted the door just in time to hear the frantic whirring of the now sentient vacuum robot outside my door. I opened my blinds and looked down into the L.A streets, as the sea of black and silver machines swarmed over the screaming crowd. A woman standing on a taxi screamed as two of the sucking bastards tackled her and began viciously sucking at her face and hands. There was a loud squelching noise and a crimson spray of gore splattered across the hood of the taxi, as her now faceless corpse slid down into the machines below. 

"Oh god, help! Someone help!" A man wearing a pink cardigan shouted, his high voice becoming hard to hear of the roar of the cacophonous machines. The man had managed to climb on to the bus that was parked below my apartment window. I wrenched open the window and threw down the emergency rope ladder, thanking my overcautious mother for the gift. 

"Grab on!" I shouted down to the man. He looked up, relief passing over his blood splattered face. He grabbed the second rung and began climbing. For a second, I though he'd make it, but then it all went to hell. A few Roombas had managed to somehow climb on to the roof of the bus and where beginning to devour the lower rungs. The man was halfway up before my door was broken down by at least thirty of the robotic bastards, each one sucking up splinters of the door. I shrieked and held on to the ladder with one hand, while struggling to fend off the ravenous vacuums with a broom. Then my hand slipped and the ladder fell. I managed to look over the edge of my windowsill to see the man fall, screaming on to the bus with a nasty crack. His leg was hanging at an odd angle, blood dripping from a compound fracture into the sea of vacuums below. Then they all turned their attention away from civilians and began to swarm the bus, pushing, shoving like a school of piranhas. The Roombas in my apartment were distracted, so I pushed them out of the way and ran down the hallway. I didn't know where to go next, but I heard about a quarantine zone a few miles outside the city. I just hoped I could make it.             
 




 Happy birthda-vorp 




 Oh totally. I need a sidekick though 




 My name is Chris. And I am a wizard. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I am an ordinary dishwasher, but secretly I use my yeti powers to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am frostyetiwizard. 




 Oh, god, I can see each of us with a Arrow style opening 




 A cross dressing superheroine vs a guy who wears yeti slippers and a wizard robe with a sonic howl? 




 Thanks! A lot of fun! I really wish we could find an artist to make a group poster, just to see how silly everyone would look! 




 During the day, he's an ordinary 20 year college student and part time dishwasher. But by night, he throws off his Smite t-shirt and becomes..... frostyetiwizard! Diving into a pair of sturdy jeans, wizard robe, Kick-Ass style mask and yeti slippers, frostyetiwizard patrols the streets of Seattle, battling foul villains from his Rogues Gallery such as Downstrike, Southafricanon and his arch enemy, firegoblinwarlock. Our heroes powers are frost beams, a magical cape that lets him fly and a sonic Yeti howl that can shatter glass.  




 Oh, I see! Well, considering how they're human-like, their home planet is about the same distance from their sun as Earth is from ours. 




 I don't quite understand.
