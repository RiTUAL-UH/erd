 I definitely get that he needs to get help for his bipolar disorder...and that other people could love those qualities. 

He doesn't call me names or do anything like that...

However, I see your point and appreciate your honesty. 




 Its for Information Technology and I'm thinking a deep red heel and deep red or black blouse... 




 My mom is a hairdresser and basically the low down on clarifying shampoo is that it shouldn't be used twice and its to remove impurities such as chlorine...

It shouldn't be used regularly and is actually really hard on your hair. 

Kind of feel like I'm missing the context of why your hair dresser told you this...Although, even if you switched colors to blonde or lighter a 'blonde shampoo' is a better choice.   




 The lather from shampoo actually isn't a good measure of anything as its all chemically created...I use dread shampoo and the lather is very very minimal and consistent because it doesn't contain these chemicals...Even Sulfate free shampoos typically have other chemicals in them...

My hair acts much better and the natural oils in my hair are not stripped from washing daily. Because I use natural oil based dread shampoo, which comes in a bar like soap..It doesn't strip any oil. Its all about what you're using.

 




 This has happened to me too recently...I've been on Marvelon 21 for over 2 years and now that I'm taking it continuously it seems very very useless. 22 days and 3 doctor's appointments/clinic visits later my period got to be over. Beyond terrible and my family doctor won't switch me to anything else. 




 She isn't a specialist but I don't really understand the difference between a specialist and a gyno/surgeon...There's only one specialist close to my area in the listings here(Halifax/Nova Scotia) and I can't find any info for him when I click the link...

And thank you for the well wishes!  




 Thank you for the advice and well wishes, I'll look into heating pads for sure! 

I know what you mean about exercise, I lose my energy very quickly. And its super frustrating because I used to be an athlete and now yoga is hard. But, I'm going to keep at it. 

 I'll try to keep physio in mind if/when I get a diagnosis.  




 I've been taking fish oil as part of my supplement routine as well as vitamin D.

 I'm actually as it happens lactose intolerant, I do try to have milk alternatives for ice cream and milk but mostly just veer away from it all because I find soy bothers me as well. 

I can see how exercise can help, I'll have to start trying some yoga..

Thanks for the advice and the well wishes, I have an appointment to see a surgeon/gyno on May 29th. Hoping she schedules me for a lap.  




 Thank you very much for the advice, I think you're right...I'll look into doing both of these! It definitely has been taking a toll, 




 I'm in Ns and wondering if this one is still current? I clicked the link in the added section but his name wasn't listed anywhere on the page... 




 Would you mind explaining the difference I'm new to all this... 




 I'm currently being relatively untreated for my endo...I'm taking vimovo(basically naproxen) twice daily 500mg. And taking my birth control continuously with issue...My appointment with my new gyno is in 2 months or so...And I'm in pain daily, low pelvic pain mostly sometimes its leg and back too though. I've been trying to manage my diet, I've cut out coffee, soy, all dairy except cheese, eggs, and started taking supplements, eating fiber, and drinking green tea...Is there anything else I can be doing to help myself? 




 _sinnerbynature 




 just wondering about how to start with this method and the best things to use for combs with back combing and that sort of thing...Does this method typically have a lot of shrinkage? How long should my hair be before I start this method...Is it possible to do your whole head alone? 




 "yurbuds, Ironman inspire series"...They're designed for the gym, and have an optional clip...As well as play, pause, etc buttons built in...The rubber piece that locks them in can be taken off if you want to use them for normal activities...

 









 Aw, thank you! :) My budget isn't great I'm kind of limited to drug store and discount stuff at the moment...I'd really like to keep my everyday look more of a natural kind of thing but I'd really appreciate any other look suggestions you think would like good! I think I just prefer natural where I'm new to make up. I like highlighting my eyes, maybe my cheek bones but I have no idea where to even start on that one. 

I really appreciate that suggestion I'm definitely going to give it a try! I'm picturing it and I think you're right about the definition without harshness...I do find the black liner a little harsh around my eyes. 




 Where can I get NYX products? I live in Canada if that helps...and Thank you so much for the suggestions! :)  




 That sounds very very doable, and hmmm...I will have to look into something a bit cheaper for sure, I'm a student on a budget but I appreciate the suggestion. 
And thank you! :) I find its a bit red without foundation but overall I can't complain. haha.  




 Well, I'm currently a student so the drug store price range is definitely ideal...I'll definitely look into the Maybelline nude palette! Thank you :) And, I have a brush I will use with my eyeshadow...it could probably be better though, lol. I'm not sure what kind of color I should go for with blush...I've never used it as I'm fairly new to make up in general. Thank you so much for the compliments they mean a lot! :) 
I'll look into the lip butters as well, I recently picked up a red lip tint but I'm not too sure about it yet...Its called santa baby from lush...I feel like red is a little too bold can you recommend me a few colors? :)
