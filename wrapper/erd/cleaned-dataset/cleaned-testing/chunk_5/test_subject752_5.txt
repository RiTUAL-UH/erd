 When you have to factor in..

* Travel cost to get equipment to site.
* Hire price for the machines to rip it up, re seal it, smooth it over etc.
    * A machine to rip up old road
    * A machine to lay new seal
    * A machine to lay new arreggrate
    * A machine to smooth it all down
    * **Not sure if you can get 1 machine to do multiple jobs?**
* Getting council approval to take road.
* OSH precautions - Road cone's diversion plans.
* Advertising may be required if it's a main state HW - so cost of hiring a fuckoff sign for a week or two.
* Cost of 5+ staff perhaps.
* Cost of clean up (dumping waste etc.)
* Cost of tar seal.
* Cost of rock aggregate.
* Cost of portaloo for time period needed.

From seeing it done a few times, depending on damage.. 
They would need to:

* Dig up X amount off road
* Lay new substrate
* Lay new tar seal and chip it

Or at least that's my extremely layman's point of view, but I'm sure you wouldn't get much change from a 80-100K $ per KM. And then you factor in redoing the bridge, this will be signifcantly higher due to probably needing to shut down the bridge/have a stop/go so probably nearer $300-400k per KM

Edit: he's recording for at least say 3minutes using this [distance calculator website cause I'm lazy..](http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/speed_distance_time_calc.html) and he's travelling at 90km/h for the entire trip, say 2minutes at 90km/h = 3kms.

So to answer your question, I would hazard a guess of around (at least) $1,000,000+ to redo the road the fucktard ripped up. 









 Ok,  let's look at meridian energy for instance. 

They generate energy which pays dividends to the government and private corporations. 
These dividends are supported by worth and profit.
To maintain their worth they must generate a X amount of profit.
They get profit from selling energy to consumers.
An extra charge (say to Maori for water rights) eats into the profit, which means they have to charge you and I more to maintain the same worth, and continue to pay dividends.

So essentially you and I will be paying more, which will be subsiding the water payment.

So again, I pay a amount which goes to government which they use to better the entire country.
If they are successful I will pay more money which will only benefit Maori.

How is this fair? 

Again I understand if the water was Tapu, or they simply want more money, and you and I will be paying for it.

 




 Preparing for the bashing here, but seriously over this fucking profit grab.

Unlike the money which is currently gathered for water rights us used by all kiwi under say the local council who charge for the usage rights, this money will go to exclusive rights to the Maori. 

How is that not racist in it's own rights? "I don't want everyday NZ'ers to benefit from the water, I want ONLY Maori to benefit from the water use." Fuck That Shit.

Edit: if you're going to downvote me, tell me why I'm wrong.
I understand the Treaty of Waitangi, I understand Maori have rights to the LAND which was taken from them, but water is a renewable resource, it's not Tapu, how can they claim rights to be able to sell it off and make the profit from it? And take profit away from everyday NZ'ers? 




 Protips: 
Add +1 hour to almost all Google City-city trips.

Don't take the main highways if you're not in a rush.

West coast anywhere = must visit.

Put the camera down, and just take in the sights without a viewfinder in front of your face.

If you're from a major city, take a walk at midnight/1am basically anywhere from the main centres = More stars than you've ever likely seen anywhere else in your life.

Oh, my hair do gets messed up.

Yea.. In all seriousness though, I would love to see [hovdings](http://www.hovding.com/how_hovding_works) being sold in NZ ay. 




 100% scam. Good luck, if you can't see em face to face don't sell them shit. They are looking to scam you. Trademe are a cesspool of lowlife scum, and Trademe themselves seemingly couldn't give a flying fuck about it. (Or there's nothing they can do.) 









 I should have known something that had been gilded that many times, but wasn't the top story was something really fishy! 




 You Sir are a legend. 




 "I quit my job to earn less to avoid paying money to help my children" would make a much more accurate Stuff article. But no, it's all governments fault. /s 




 Nah man you've missed the point - just a lot of bad stories about German tourists. You don't hear of other nationalities stealing returned camper vans, or camping out in red zone houses or pulling knives on people.
I don't know why they're all Germans, but it's just not a good look. 




 To explain my headline:

* German tourists pulled knife on a reporter when he approached them in New Brighton while they were covering a piece on freedom camping.
* German tourists camped out in a Redzone house last year, shitting all over the place.
* German tourists told there are easy pickings in tourists returning camper vans to Chch Airport (implying it's been done numerous times before). 



















 This sounds like a piss take surely.  









 Thanks for the update, good luck to you both. 
It's stressful enough losing an income without this on top. 

Just keep a recording/write down everything that happens so as little as possible can be disputed should it go that far.

Put it this way, I got hit by a car recently, they disputed they were at fault. I had a dash cam recording as proof so insurance waived excess immediately. :) 




 English is not my forte. 




 God damn grammar fail. Re-read it like 5 times too. Fuck it. 




 Ironically if you ever did that to a sheep while you're shearing it you would probably be shot on sight. 














 To be honest they are probably relying on you giving up and going away. 

The trouble is if the assholes are going to do it to you, chances are they will try it on with someone else, so fully don't give up.

By seeking legal advice you could let them know you're playing hard ball, which could be enough to scare them into paying without any further fuss. 

I'm not sure were you are, but here's a [Free phone Canterbury Law advice helpline](http://www.canlaw.org.nz/legal-info-by-phone)

[Or find your local community law centre](http://www.communitylaw.org.nz/your-local-centre/find-a-community-law-centre/)

Edit: ensure ALL your correspondence with them is captured, if you phone them put them on speaker and have another phone recording them. Of course tell them: "For complete disclosure, this call is being recorded and may be used should this matter have to go to court." it might seem like a dick move, but if it's your word against theirs don't make their life any easier.  




 A better roll out method for Android updates that don't involve such a stupendously lengthy process.

Seriously, I'm faced with my wife's S4 being upgraded to lollipop before my S5 for goodness sake. 




 Yeah..very. 














 He was a recidivist dangerous driver, was stoned and on the wrong side of the road. Fuck that judge with a deepheat coated pole. 

My condolences to the family, that us not justice, that's a joke. 




 Don't touch the camera with sunblock on your hands [it's actually really bad for the plastic.](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/08/29/psa-sunblock-bad-camera/#.VSTjS0OuTXm) 




 We're with state with 2 cars and contents. Coupled with roadside assistance we've been more than happy with the 2 car claims so far, no contents yet. 

Good price with a package discount.  




 Most car advertisements.

This car is going to make you feel awesome. 

Fuck, I can think a lot of cheaper ways to make you feel awesome than a $50,000 car. 




 your name is apt in the context of this comment. 




 What kind of tokens do you find? 




 Buzzbars are also good frozen if you can get your hands on one! 









 My hat off to you. How do you cope without wanting to give the little buggers a good smack? 




 Really? Did not know that. As I said it's very well tinted windows. God that must be a boring job. 




 Nah, it's a dedicated speed camera. (Dark blue van with camera sticking out the rear heavily tinted window.)

But that does raise a good point, now this could be because I see a very censored view of NZ policing via police television shows, but I see your point in that if someone is doing 1 thing dodgy, chances are likely they're also doing other stupid shit - like if they're not wearing their seatbelt, they could have an unrego'd car or something. Again, that's just from seeing TV shows, but it confirms your theory of if someone looks dodge, it's cause they are? 




 For the record (and yes, I've never had a speeding ticket so can throw  stones. (for now again)) most speedo's are calibrated to +2-3km/h at 50km/h and +4-7km/h at 100km/h.

So if you were stupid enough to drive with your needle above the +5km mark, you're going to get caught. 

Drive at 50-55km/h and you're going to get lasered at 48-53km/h no problems. 

Source = my driving past the concealed fuckers down Fendalton road in Chch every morning. 




 So basically, target the people who drink in moderation and who probably WILL PAY to avoid a conviction than increase the charges for those who drink to excess and WHO FUCKING DON'T PAY anyway?  

Fucking GENIUS! I bet the politician who thought this up while playing golf on a Wednesday morning got a massive pay rise. 




 Actually totally agree with you. It's fucking hardcore bullshit our pussy ass politicians target mum and dad enjoying a wine with dinner while refusing to man up and increase the punishment for the hardcore recidivist drink drivers.

If you drink and and drive once with quite a few on board = cash and demerits.
Again = cash and demerits.
Again cash and and demerits.

The definition of stupidity is doing exactly the same thing and expecting the same result. Stupid fuckers are going to be stupid fuckers. 

Demerits? They'll drive anyway. Thanks to under staffed police they're willing to risk it.

Fines? fuck it - throw it on my tab! Then when it grows too big, the court inevitably sentence them to a hundred hours or so community detention. Which if you work it out for some of the worst offenders, they are essentially being paid at a rate of a FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR? It's a fucking joke. 
 




 Also photos taken using a cellphone operated by sticking it into your mouth and breathing on the camera lens. 




 Does anyone mind Eli5 please?  Why is this a big thing?  









 You ass. His mother died, he got shot. For sharing a funny moment. 




 Never mind, I can see my thoughts aren't welcome here.

 He was following them for a reason to begin with. I see your logic, but why else follow then without some insidious purpose?  




 Actually you're waving that flag. Not them.

 Fucking idiot. There's nothing else to say. 




 Indeed. 




 Thank you, fixed it, had to re post as it wouldn't let edit. 



















 You have to wonder why no-one caught on earlier.. Do no fucking parents ask what their children do at school? 

"Hey Johnny, what did you do at school today?"

"Oh our teacher blindfolded me and asked me to eat some cookies with a salty taste"

"Oh, that's a good boy"? ? ? 

Seriously wtf.  




 It's around the fucking world, fucking hypocritical cunts. A few young adults in the states willingly created a video of them in a sex act, so the court charged them with creating child pornography. [Source](http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/01/teens-charged-for-sex-tape-in-chicago)

Like the ones who are charging the them never had sex at that age.  




 We have so many different spoken, written and sign languages. 

Not to mention electronic communication like typing using a physical keyboard, or a software keyboard on mobile phones. 

Even then you've got dvorak, qwerty and other proprietary formats. And furthermore you've got various forms of swiping or tapping your letters.

With so many forms, is there a better version above the rest? If so why is it better?  



















 Just fucking carefully cut your existing one to size? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVqRRLVHtfk

You fuck up, I barely bear no responsibility. 




 Thanks, that may have helped.......!  




 So SKY, Mediaworks and TVNZ (TV1, TV2, TV3, TV4 and Prime) are all pissedoff we can get..

* Faster Content. 
NZ can wait *years* for Movies and TV shows etc to come to TV!

* More convenience to watch what we want. When we want. 
Instead of subscribing to some shitty unreliable expensive HDD recorder, or paying money to still have advertising anyway we can download and watch them them on any TV or mobile device whenever/wherever we want!

* Easier: Again without DRM restrictions, it's a "Hey mate, here's a flash drive with the latest GoT episode".

* Cheaper: Sky increased their prices recently, the Commerce Commission investigated and basically said "Sky are a monopoly and can charge whatever they want." (I'm not kidding.)

* Access to just soooo much more content than **anyone** can offer NZ consumers. 

So tell me where's the draw card for going through the piss poor selection available to NZ buyers? You've provided a poor service, years too late, and for way to much money. Then you bitch about it?

They can charge as much as they want, but unless the market things it's a fair deal it ain't going to happen. 




 Fuckin' Genius. 




 Indeed. However we're way too lenient on "shit cunt" drivers in court. So there's very little to stop the stupendous amount of recidivist "shit cunts".  




 They specifically touted "Zero" tolerance over the Xmas break, which failed epically. 

It would good be for a police person to confirm, but I've seen most cars not get caught at 5-7km/h so I can only presume they're lowering the tolerance to only 4km/h and will be more vigilant in pulling you over/issuing a fine? 




 Hi /r/NewZealand,

Neighbourly.co.nz is a Fairfax run community congregation website designed to help connect neighbours communicate and keep in touch about local events and goings on. 

Local area events like:

* BBQ's 
* Work wanted
* Local fairs
* Garage sales
* Community events like Street Parties
Etc.

This is all dependent upon local involvement, obviously someone needs to post these events, but as it's been out for a wee while now, and thanks to advertising drives it is getting more and more popular, so while there may not be much happening in your area it's worth sticking with it. 

My sister in Wellington really waxed lyrical about it so thought it was worth a go so I signed up recently and was quite surprised with the amount of people in my area using it. 

Depending on your local politician and police involvement you can also receive alerts like local burgarlies and political speaking events in your area as well.

When you sign up initially you can gain immediate access by supplying a cellphone number, but you do have limited interaction until you receive a letter by post containing your verification code as to confirm your identity and your local area. This can take a wee while. 




 The key to driving in ~~Nelson~~ anywhere in the South Island is assuming that no one knows what the fuck they are doing at any given moment, and to drive as if everyone is poised to kill you. 




 Just become on of the growing many who are posting dashcam footage on Facebook. Sweet social media revenge. 














 Samsung phones can do it, as well as sync with calendar, and photo albums. (Facebook albums appear in gallery).

 









 Reading the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy_murders) the whole affair is actually horribly hilarious in a cruel and twisted way.

Mark was found guilty in 2002. 

Sentenced to Life, minimum non-parole of 17 years.

He then appealed and this was increased to a non-parole of 20 years.

He then appealed again, and was immediately sentenced to 20 years non-parole.

**He's been found guilty THREE TIMES**

He was eligible to get out in 2019 had he been a good prisoner. Now he can't get out 'til 2022. And I wonder if the fact he still maintains his innocence will count against him in his parole hearings? 




 No tax bill in NZ. :) 




 Came here from /r/Android and did quite a double take. Well played mods. 

Edit: the signatures are a very nice touch! 




 Actually. Good point.  




 Actually I thought it quite funny? 









 They came, they lost and now the must suffer the humiliation for the rest of their lives. (Well, while people can still Google them.) 




 Sorry Cassiusz

This isn't a good look for me at the moment. I'll clean up my act!

Thanks, TehGerbil. 




 Oh YAaa..... Wait. lol. 




 Also freeze marshmallow easter eggs. 




 Come here, take a seat. 




 Indeed. NZ and Kiwi dollar are bloody neck and neck at the moment. 




 Well described for most things, but I was pleasantly surprised that they actually looked at the device on its own merits, rather than comparatively with the iPhone.  




 It can easily and quickly share photos and videos (re-encoding them to a compatible format across the OS versions) to multiple people at once.
Edit: I know it's the *only* one, but for many people it's the *best* at what it does.  




 I couldn't find any news articles so I've had to take a screenshot: http://imgur.com/NnP0IXz

I'm in the Facebook [Beta program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/introducing-the-facebook-for-android-beta-testing-program/10151529228878920) so not sure when it roll it fully, or ever at all depending on stability feedback. 









 Hence why I didn't link it.. :-D it's really a non story though.. I'm sure the journalist who wrote it will get a raise.. 




 Yes, messaging her over Facebook for goodness sake. They would have instantly made her day significantly shit. 




 No such thing as bad publicity eh? 




 Given what a significant difference lights have made on the intersection of Idris/Glandovey I'd be pretty happy about lights instead of that god forsaken roundabout. 









 I thought it rather ironic.  









 Well said. 









 The issue is there's precious other resources which have localised news. 

There's [The Scoop](http://www.scoop.co.nz/) which is alright, but being 'dependent' doesn't mean they don't put their own spin on things.  




 Retail workers get very little 'normal' time off, so those precious few days are novocaine for our souls. 




 But when it's been 2 months, the majority of the feedback I saw last time this was brought up it was also "just let it die for goodness sake" I think they've gone too far this time. 









 Indeed. 2 months is a long time, clearly the poor girl thought it had blown over enough for her to reactivate her Facebook. 
I reckon it's a tad cruel to potentially reignite it all by having it as a headline on The Press and Stuff. 




 Headline article on Stuff.co.nz is the girl 'caught' by voyeurs at the pub with her pants down with her boss (?) is leaving for the UK. 

The 'journalists' have been seemingly monitoring her Facebook account, noticed she reactivated it, and attempted to message her about the whole affair.

I'm not giving them satisfaction of more clicks, the link is available on Stuff.co.nz if you so please

Horse is flogged, whipped, beaten and just needs to be left alone? 




 Fully understand. To be fair in this case "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all" comes to mind. 




 Thanks, I'll look it up. 




 Awesome, thanks! 




 When you're drunk you're the most honest I suppose.
Hassling the opponents for the purpose of upsetting their psyche is definitely in the rule book.

I think the significant contrast in attitudes to sportsmanship behaviour while on the field between the 2 sides is well known and his comment just highlights this.

I think that's what's probably making this worst than it first sounds.    




 For instance:

* Are those fuel injectors that "clean and protect" worth it?
* Is higher than 91 octane better for your car?
* Is it worth cleaning/replacing your spark plugs or air filter?
* Do you recommend changing the oil every X months?
* Do engines really get build up if they're only ever driven about around town? (Aka: low revs/speed.)
 




 If his comment was meant in jest it's still a fucking uncomfortable thing to say. 




 Indeed. As someone from my FB feed said: It speaks a lot to your character that someone acting nice around makes you so uncomfortable you feel the need to be mean back. 









 The simple fact is from an economic perspective we need the money that foreign oil and gas exploration brings in. 

The only thing we can keep doing is keep reporting this kind of stuff and sign petitions to ensure there's minimal impact to the local flora and fauna (if onshore) and minimal disruption to our marine environment (if offshore.) 

Yes I would amazing if the world could suddenly perform an about turn and stop using oil etc, but the simple fact is that isn't going to happen for a few years. 

In the meantime we need to be smart about how we whore out our natural resources. 




 This is the *E* series though, but yes, their designers ought to be fired. 




 Jesus. 3 minutes of pure fear for the passengers. 














 Are*. Sorry for potato grammar. 




 Are*. Sorry for potato grammar. 




 As you're all aware, Easter Friday and Sunday this weekend (4 day weekend, hell yeah!) but it means most super markets etc are shut on Friday 3rd April, and Sunday 5th April. 

This usually means horrendous queues on Thursday, Saturday, and Monday, so if you want to avoid the queues (if you can) just  a heads up to get long range shopping done earlier in the week. :) 




 In before Nick gets punched in the face by someone who's thoroughly over it. 




 Nice skills op. 




 Thanks OP shamelessly reposted to Facebook. (via imgur link.) 




 Thank you :)
