 Herbal Salvation, you would have to order in bulk to get that price though. 




 lol. Yes. 20 dollars for 25 grams is too much. I think I pay 5 dollars for 25 grams. 




 Just looking at it makes me feel like you spent a lot of money for it. At least it's good quality though. 




 That's interesting. I was gonna say to mix a green with a red and up the dose to around six grams but if you tried one from each for a total of six grams, Idk what good it would do to try my idea. 




 Are you taking different strains or just mostly one? Are you mixing your strains in your doses at all? 




 Ohhhhhhh. No chance of that. Not after only a few days. 




 Yeah just add more to it, although I can't imagine there would be enough stuck on the inside of the bottle to actually do anything. I mean, even a gram stuck on the inside of a bottle would look like a shit load. 




 Yeah I thought about mentioning that but decided to only mention the ones I've actually done myself. Smoking oxy seems like it would be such a waste compared to shooting it. lol 




 I would think that extract would be the only way to go, if one was to attempt it. 




 I would like some free kratom please. 




 Black tar heroin. Opium. Fentanyl gel.  




 Ha. Some people just aren't built for toss and wash. Not necessarily an allergy. 




 NEVER MIND. NOW I'M NOT GONNA GET ANY. 




 OH MAN I'M GONNA GET SOME NOW 




 Oh really? Sometimes I think about trying it, but I have an extremely addictive personality and the last thing I need is another habit... especially something that could possibly cause withdrawal like that. 




 Fucking alarm clocks, how do they work? 




 The only thing I know about phenibut is you're not supposed to take it every day cuz the withdrawal will have you fucked up after like two or three days of consecutive use. 




 That's a true statement. 




 Oh.. and some say it suppresses appetite. I demolish shit after I dose, though. 




 Some people say it's good to have a little something in your stomach. I am not one of those people. The emptier the better, as far as my body is concerned. Don't ever take it when you're full though. It'll be wasted. 




 Yeah. I throw it under my tongue and then swig water, mix it around in my mouth so it's not stuck to anything, then kick my head back like a dog and swallow. Always had a bad time trying to put it on my tongue. It's the most efficient method concerning preparation time, effort, effects, and onset time. Some people just can't do it though. 




 Real men have to shoot their load all over themselves when they toilet jerk cuz their wieners are too long to aim down into the toilet. 




 Well. You could try lowering your dose little by little and see if those effects go away. You could also try switching strains, or your vendor. I take 5-6 grams three times a day and have never had any problems like that. Everybody's different though. Strain/vendor switch would probably be worth a try if you haven't already. 




 It's not an extract, just leaf. Take 2-3 grams to start off, just to be safe. Real men toss and wash. 




 If you're opioid tolerant, which you are, 3 grams of kratom isn't shit. If you were deeper into withdrawal when you took it, you would probably notice it more. I personally would try 5-6 grams on an empty stomach. That's me though. You may still not feel much, unless you give it a few weeks and lose your tolerance. 




 Mmm. Pita bread. 




 A fat naked lady shows up and poops on an old man's chest. 




 I'm not sure that classifies as boiling water. 




 Yeah man I tried it again yesterday. Trash. I'm done fuckin with it. I'm sure other people love it but RVS and RVT all day long for me baby. 




 I'M FREAKIN OUT 




 Can you elaborate  




 Huh? 




 Try doing them with a dildo jammed up your asshole. 




 Incognitooooo 




 Donna and the cocktasters. 




 Wut. 




 Hopefully I enjoy it someday, but as of now, I don't even want to try it again. Lol. How much RVS do you normally take? And how much Maha Kali? The same amount? 




 Sure. Send me some money so I can buy some, you stupid asshole. 




 Fuck man. I heard that too. Try mixing them tomorrow instead of today.
 




 Good, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who notices it. Yes, my Bali and RVT are both from HS. Try the 2:1 RVT to Bali ratio, if you have some on hand. It's something special. 




 "i was talking about grammer". I know bro, I was talking about grammar too. Did you mean to say "wasn't" instead of "was"? You somehow just made yourself into a great example, supporting my earlier reference to your grammar. Speaking of English classes, you should go see if a professor will pay you to be a case study. A lot can be learned by attempting to read the trainwreck nonsense you type up. I NEVER point out people's grammatical errors. I'm far from a grammar nazi. I just couldn't help pointing out your ironic statement. TL;DR You're lucky I don't know you personally or I'd come FISTFUCK YOU IN THE COCKSUCKER. 




 Ok well I've taken single strains by themselves only about 102746 times, and it never gets me to where I want to be no matter what. Mixing Green Bali with reds is what does it for me. I wouldn't even be taking kratom if I wasn't mixing them the way I do because it wouldn't have the effect I'm looking for. I wasn't asking why I'm not satisfied, I'm asking if anybody else notices the same thing when they first try a new strain. The same thing happened to me with RVS, RVB, RVT, and RV Hulu Kapuas... I took them twice to begin with and didn't feel much, and then after that they started working great. Also, I don't mean to be a dick either, but I find it strange you think I sound like a kid when I'm the one who uses correct grammar, and you can't even be bothered to spell out the word "you". Either way, thanks for the advice. 




 Alright alright alright. So I usually take 5-6 grams of Red Vein Sumatran/Green Bali mixed at a 2:1 ratio, respectively. I do this before work in the morning, and then after work in the late afternoon. Then at about 8 I dose one more time, except I substitute Red Vein Thai for the RVS. I do that just for kicks, mostly. Well, the time came to order some more Green Bali, and I decided to cop a 25 gram sack of that Maha Kali everybody keeps going on and on about. Well, the shit came today. I just got home and jammed 6ish grams down my cocksucker, same mixture ratio as usual but using Maha Kali in place of the RVS. A half hour or so has past, and by now, I would usually be feeling great. But at this point I'm actually regretting not taking my usual RVS. I definitely always feel better than this by now. However... I've noticed in the past that the first one or two times I take a new strain, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I'm hoping that's the situation here. Does anybody else notice that happening to them? 




 I'm not your pops. Him and I are Eskimo brothers, though. 




 You've got your work cut out for you, son. 




 Thanks for contributing to this conversation. Leave it to shmooly the fuckfaced asshole to point out things we already know. 




 That's the only place I can find any word of it. Have you found it anywhere else? It's kind of strange that they're telling you to stock up while you can lol, considering they sell it. 




  I appreciate your humor. 




 That brother Phalze thought Miami was so nice, he had to live there twice. 




 I had the exact same reaction a couple times. The first was the only time I ever tried a white vein, and the second was the last time I took Maeng Da. I only took a half gram of it.

 Wayward apostrophes gave my mom the shingles.  




 You say settle down, but your username unsettles my scrotum pretty severely. 




 Idk what strain viva Zen is but I'm pretty sure everybody here is just going to tell you to buy some plain leaf strains and cap your own. You'll save like one million dollars a day. 




 Yeah. My sweet spot is six grams but everybody's different, would be a shame to start at four and end up taking more everyday than he needs to. 




 Start at 2. 




 Ha. I play guitar. I was bluffing again though. I'm not gonna write a song about this. I have a bluffing problem. 




 I'm gonna write a song about this someday. 




 A toilet jerk? 




 That's a pretty good idea. I was bluffing about a toiler jerk at work though. At work means on the kratom. On the kratom means no toilet jerks. My right arm isn't toned enough to deal with a kratom jack toilet jerk.

 I just assume USPS is going to be late when I'm putting an order in. I do it like 2-3 weeks ahead of time. I'd much rather do that than pay those FedEx or UPS fuckfaces to do it. 




 "Exploded when it hit my throat" Thanks for giving me an at-work boner. Might have to go for a toilet jerk. 




 I..... I love it 




 lol. I love using my smartphone on the toilet. I dunno about you, but my pisser works funny on kratom. It's sort of stop and go sometimes, and I love using my smartphone on the toilet so much, that I always piss sitting down too. I end up spending like 10 minutes on the toilet every time I piss, and my bitch always ends up yellin at me. She thinks I jerk it in there. Sometimes I do jerk it, though, if it's been long enough since my last dose. Toilet jerks are one of life's greatest simple pleasures. 




 I spend most of my free time trying to shit.
