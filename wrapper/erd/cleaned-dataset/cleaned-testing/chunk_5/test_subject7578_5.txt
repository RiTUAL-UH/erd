 Jason Statham made this movie 




 My thoughts

Jurassic Park - amazing 
The Lost World - average
Jurassic Park 3 - bad

what are your thoughts on the trilogy?? Are you excited for Jurassic World? 














 awesome 




 Toy Story trilogy, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo

p.s. i've never seen the Incredibles (yep.) 




 im actually really looking forward to it!  




 the 1 movie i always forget is coming out this year.  




 so many haters. i like the look of this!  




 I just randomly wondered who Clarke could play in the DCCU and i think he would be awesome as Dent/Two-Face (if he ever became Two face) what do you guys think?
who should Clarke play if he came to the DCCU?
