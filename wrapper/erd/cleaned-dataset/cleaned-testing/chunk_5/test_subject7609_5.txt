 It is not 




 The author won a Hugo award, but keep on rockin dude 
























 That person was me. The book you hated was a popcorn horror novel. It wasn't trying to be Pynchon or Delillo. You are also greatly exaggerating how bad the book was.

The book also received a Kirkus starred review,  which is fairly hard to achieve ( https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/josh-malerman/bird-box-malerman/), so maybe the one with bad taste is you?  




 Nope 




 I thought it was pretty enjoyable. To each their own 



















 I don't understand the hype for this book at all. Amateurish writing, boring, ephebophilic, rambling, pretentious trash 




 I have more or less everything besides some of the new set legendaries. I drafted a lot 




 Why do people think this sub is antiques roadshow

 I find it very unlikely that someone looking for their next read would think: I want something by a self-published author. It would be like logging on to iTunes to buy some music and selecting, instead of rock/pop, a category called "songs recorded in people's bedrooms".

This is pretty much punk/indie music 




 *Nobody is Ever Missing* by Catherine Lacey 




 I assume this is a known issue. Is this a priority to get fixed? I have a Samsung S5, and here's a non comprehensive list of things I can't really do

* Clicking on "Create new game" does not work
* Trying to join an in progress game from the main screen does not work
* Can't select a card when discarding with aetherphage
* Can't select cards from graveyard with cards like Killion
* Can't self target with triggered cards like Shardbound Invoker
* Can't self target with activated cards like Contagion Lord
* App will occasionally crash when receiving rewards or opening packs

I've given up even playing on mobile until there's an update. Anyone having similar problems?

* *Crapalachia: A Biography of a Place* by Scott McClanahan

* *Samedi the Deafness* by Jesse Ball 




 To enjoy reading some good books 









 This list is very good overall, but especially glad to see *Nobody is Ever Missing* on this list. It has not gotten the hype that it deserves, in comparison to most of the other books listed. 









 Draft is still too fast for my liking, but with the consistent mechanic, overload, powerful underdops like shardbound invoker, and scaled spells like Howl, it's probably never going back to a slower meta like it once was before. To be fair, these were all implemented to stop level screw from having such a huge impact, which I think they have successfully done.

Tracker is also way too good still 




 Can you tell us anything about the Southern Reach film adaptation? What would be your dream cast?

 *warlock* by oakley hall 




 simply incorrect 




 and multiple others said he had his hands in the air - almost like this needed a trial or something! 




 Simple answer is "not really" 




 Maybe 50 percent of every book written does this 




 Annihilation was great, authority and acceptance were just ok.

Highly recommend checking out The Third Bear, great book 




 great taste/username 




 I'm sure this woman appreciated a defining moment of her career being capped off with a watermelon joke. What a buffoon.

 Not every great novel provides great discussion. What are a few that worked well for your group? 




 *A Storm of Swords* by George R.R. Martin. It's popular so it's probably not a cool choice anymore, but it's still my favorite after many years of reading 




 Right in the feels 




 obviously not 




 Once you have paying customers, you can't just shoo away complaints because you have arbitrarily labeled your game as in beta.

 great changes. two thumbs up 




 Adam Driver as Boris from the Goldfinch 









 thank you 




 imgur link anyone? 




   Even Magic: The Gathering, with its 20 years of experience, ends up having to ban cards every set (most recently Jeskai Ascendency, Dig Through Time, Treasure Cruise)

I don't play anymore, but I don't think these are actually banned yet? Could be wrong 




 I would like to see SBE post top lifetime win ratios, rather than just weekly wins/win ratios for a change 




 Because he was being a douche 




 You do not need to explain it to me like I'm a child - I understand the changes.

With the new changes, they removed a primary motivator for many people to pay this game - going infinite. They already added casual draft, does this game need to cater to casual players 100 percent of the time? Nobody would be complaining if they left the competitive tournament queue payouts the same with all of the other positive changes.  




 Why reward the players that are actually good? Let's just coddle the whiny babies instead 




 The changes look good, except for one thing, unless I'm mistaken - with the restructuring of tournament prizes, there is no way to go infinite anymore?

Edit: never mind, noticed they pay out silver instead of tickets. Not sure if I'm a fan? Seems harder to go infinite, but maybe the elite tournament makes up for it. 




 What time does the game unlock? 




 What a totally asinine, biased, and uninformed view about M:TG. As a former player who has played the game for about 15 years, about half of which competitively, here's where you're off base.

 Magic players have no problem spending $200~ on a deck that will only see around 4 months of play (due to newer sets coming out, making your older cards no longer legal). This, to me, is insane. You can, of course, make a deck much cheaper. With that said, it is unlikely you will find any success unless you use more expensive, rarer cards.

Sort of true, but very, very, misleading. Yes, top tier standard decks cost upward of 200 dollars, but it's not like players are just dropping 200 bucks every four months, the way you make it seem. Magic is an investment over time. Each set stays in Standard for two years. Due to different popular formats (modern, legacy) and casual formats (commander), the chase rares of a set will hold a good portion of their value once they rotate out of standard. Trading/Lending is also a huge part of Magic culture. It can be expensive to start from go from nothing to having a top tier deck, but this is not the path 95% of players take.

The most expensive formats are the ones that use nearly all the cards. Needless to say, decks can cost $1,000s. Here is a link to a popular card in these types of decks. Do you see the price? That's a legitimate $200 for one card. Decks that play this creature want to run the maximum 4 copies. That means, if you want to use this card in your deck, you're likely spending $800 to do so. That's just 4 cards out of your 60 card deck. It's insane.

Again, wrong. The players that play these formats are experienced ones who have built their collection over time, have at least a couple years of experience, and have either opened these cards years ago, traded for them, borrowed etc. These formats are not run nearly as often as standard, so when they take place at a large scale, cards are heavily borrowed within the community, which is pretty tightly knit. No one just drops a thousand dollars on a deck like it's nothing.

As a final note, many players ignore the cost of their decks by claiming that the value in their cards is not lost. Tarmogoyf, as shown before, is a $200 card. When you play with it, it's still $200, and you'll be able to use its value to potentially sell for your money back when your "done" or trade it away for more cards. It is painfully clear that you will never get your money back on any of these cards. Only the historic rares, like the Black Lotus, ever exchange hands for meaningful money. Players will only ever offer you more cards, and stores will undercut you severely. Your money is lost forever within every card you purchase.

Wrong again! Here's a link to an completed ebay listings of Tarmogoyfs - http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40 _sacat=0 _nkw=tarmogoyf LH_Complete=1 rt=nc As you can see, they're mostly selling for $150 each. Like anything else, you will not get 100% of listed value, but to say that you will never sell them? Wrong wrong wrong.

If everyone in the world decided that Magic: The Gathering was an amazing game, and we all wanted to play it, we couldn't. This is because there are not enough copies of the cards for all of us. Tarmogoyf isn't just expensive because he's a popular card. He's also expensive because there aren't enough copies of him for everyone. Proxies are illegal in all sanctioned tournaments, which means that most MTG fans will never get to play in formats where Tarmogoyf is legal.

That's why Standard and limited exist - the cards are readily available. It's hard to find smaller weekly tournaments that *aren't* standard or limited, so to the regular player, this shouldn't affect him at all.

I don't know what it is about card game communities, but it seems to attract some of the oddest. Are the people pictured "good people?" Maybe, but most won't want the association. Other geek hobbies seem to have grown mainstream. Comic-Con is filled with beautiful people in costumes. Call of Duty is something the average-Joe plays on weekends with his buds. Magic: The Gathering, and other card games, have "Crack Gate". In my year of playing MTG, the majority of **the people I met were either children, college-drop-outs, drug addicts, mentally-unstable, or any combination of the former**. In the same way Sonic attracts a "strange" crowd, card games do as well. There's a lot of fun you can have playing these games, and merit in interacting with these people, but I cannot blame anyone who would refuse to do so.
Of course, people of all walks of life play these games, just as all sorts of people do anything. I mean no disrespect to any particular person or people.

Really dude, could you be more insulting and condescending? You're posting on a forum about video games, you really feel like you're above these people? You really think cosplayers and people that go to cons are totally free of weird people? Yeah, there are different people that play Magic, but there are weird people that do everything, especially of the nerd persuasion. There are obviously bad seeds, but most of the people you meet are genuinely nice people and wouldn't bat an eye to help out a new player. 




 I choose winning and taking the legendary... 




 I always pick legendaries no matter what. It's still a fourth of a legendary you actually want, even if you already own three and the card is horrible in draft.  




 It's possible to win with other faction combinations, but in my opinion, nothing is close to the power of U/N.

So, unless there's a legendary there, no. 




 factotum by bukowski 














 r/writing is 




 Hi, I just checked out this game last night, but have lots of tcg experience (mtg for 15+ years, most competitive, solforge, hearthstone, etc. ..).

I am looking to play this game without spending money. Is it viable? In other online ccgs, it is possible to build nearly everything you need over time, while playing limited to build your collection. Can i do that here? Are there daily rewards? Can i join tournaments and buy legendaries without platinum, which seems like a bought currency? 

Would definitely appreciate advice from other F2Pers, or just be told that this is not the game for me. Thanks! 




 Not something a new player should expect though,  regardless of tcg background 




 You can't grind out a collection in this game. It's either pay, or amass one for free over time.

There are daily rewards for login, 1 online win, 1 win, and 3 wins. Every win will also net you 100 silver, which is not nearly enough to be worth grinding. 




 It took place around week 3 though, not at the deadline. 




 Yeah, killing hundreds of people is equivalent to sleight of hand tricks, totally the same situation 




 Fuck them, they deserve what they get 




 The problem is Stoneblade's to fix. It is not an unsolvable problem. Other games either circumvent this toxic behavior through timers, or punish repeat offenders by banning them from the game.

It's pretty clear Stoneblade has no intention of dealing with this behavior, so expect plenty of 15+ minute waits in between games in the draft queue. 




 lol give me a break 




 Ahahahahahaha

 related to books how 




 The pictures show the book the short story is contained in - usually a collection. 


































 Popular YA lit isn't representative of all current writing. If you like Vonnegut, try *Tigerman* by Nick Harkaway. Orwell, try *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball. Bukowski? try *Person* by Sam Pink, or *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria. Try reading Denis Johnson, Atwood, Tartt, DeLilo, Adichie, Murakami, DFW.

Stay open minded. You won't like everything you read, but if you aren't afraid to try something new, you aren't going to branch out and will miss out on a ton of great reading.  




 What have you read that is current? 




 This is a colossally stupid point of view. You didn't like the Hunger Games so you're going to write off every book in the past twenty years? Keep on truckin!  




 Check out Jesse Ball, great author that fits the bill of what you're looking for. Any of his four novels are worth reading. 

Probably should get on watching some Lynch as well 









 technically not strictly better since they are in different factions 









 new player here, feel like I understand most of the game so far, but not sure on how preseason works.

Is there a point to loading up my roster with 80 guys, and keeping my sure starters off of the preseason depth chart? 

I understand that rankings only change at the end of the season on paper, but fluctuate throughout the season under the hood. Do the player rankings for young rookies/guys trying to make the team vary wildly enough that I should be heavily evaluating preseason play?

Or is the point just to keep starters from getting injured?

Thanks! 




 I survived Carlos Hyde's three consecutive fourth quarter goal line carries (including a fourth and one) to preserve my five point lead going into MNF. 




 Hi Shane, I've just recently read Light Boxes and have Crystal Eaters in my to-read stack on my nightstand, great stuff.

What are the authors/works that have influenced your writing the most? Conversely, what are some non-literary (tv, film, life in general) influences?

What's next after Crystal Eaters? 









 Sam pink 




 because this sub sucks 




 Then yes, you should certainly complain 




 Stupid rule but you should have complained about it before you drafted 




 Thanks for the informative post 




 Haven't read it, but I do like the author quite a bit.  




 I'm aware. I've been playing the deck since crafting for killion opened, and it's just not very good. It has a lot of bad draws, especially if you are playing first. Many games you just get smashed in PL1 and your leveling is worthless because you lost the game before making it to PL2. The deck also loses to random trash like sporelord.

The deck is capable of coming in second, sure, but it is not tier 1. That's results oriented thinking. There is a reason is showing up less and less.  




 AT scorchmane is fun but it stinks. I played it for a bit until I was tired of losing and switched back to BQ/Doomriding, the deck is just too good 




 I'm about three quarters through *The Goldfinch* by Donna Tartt. Very good so far

 I think Seal is fine. It's powerful but not insane like it was before. Personally, I think constructed needs more balancing than draft does. 




 I think you made the right choice. 
























 I have an eReader and an open mind - If the book comes recommended or sounds interesting, I will read it.  




 What are the three best books you've read over the past 6 months? What would you recommend as the best place to start for someone new to your work? 




 I would suggest just getting a quick reference guide type book. We used Baby 411 and it was really handy. I wouldn't recommend comprehensively reading any book, especially the "So you're going to be a dad" type books, they're just pandering bullshit really. 




 Uterra is still the best by a lot. Alloyin seems like it's the worst, and my preferences are generally U/N - U/T - U/A - T/N - A/T. 

I'm sure plenty of people love A/T, but it just doesn't work for me. The citadel wall deck is good if you get the cards, but if you whiff on citadels or the 7/2 guy, your deck just sucks and you end up 1-3. Alloyin doesn't have many great tricks like it used to with matrix warden, and even strategist feels unimpressive compared to cards in other factions.

Lysian Shard, batterhide, the new 3/6 consistent guy, and dysian siphon are all obviously nuts and gamebreakers. Seal is still great and usually a first pick but it isn't the play it at all costs card it used to be. 

Highly prioritize nearly any good consistent card, any of the good one shot cards (siphon, hound, burnout), and the rank 2 cycle. 




 Since when is not conceding bad form? 




 "Just concede" is the definition of an obvious non-solution. People say it so often here in regard to anything, and it's something you simply wouldn't do in a tourney queue. Nobody cares about regular queue games 




 That's not an option, as they could easily fuck up or fizzle the combo. Some of us don't want to waste 10 minutes finding out. 




 You realize multiple people, including Beta Ray Bill, Storm, and Captain America, have wielded Mjolnir, right? 




 Why? People didn't have any problem with Thor being an alien. But a woman? God forbid. 




 It is, but it's more so for jodorowsky fans than fans of Dune. He takes quite a few liberties with the plot 




 They don't take ratings into effect though. It will still recommend books based off the one you gave one star.  




 Stop wasting time on reddit and read a book?  




 Good series. Annihilation is going to go down as a cult classic, great book. Authority/acceptance were good, but not near the quality of the first. I think if you wanted to, you could just read annihilation as a stand alone, but I am glad i finished the series. 

Recommending *The Third Bear*, a short story collection that is Vandermeer's best work in my opinion. 




 brookline booksmith 




 What a great topic -  a bunch of people saying they are the same, the lone dissenter downvoted to the bottom - never seen that in this sub before 




 Drop him 




 That seems fine. Lose two shaky rb plays for one shaky rb play, and upgrade qb and get a solid backup te. Pretty fair but it benefits you in my opinion.  




 do not do this trade unless you're also getting bernard or marshall for somebody like hill or hilton. Even if you don't like peyton this year, he is a name that people will give you much more value for than just philip rivers. 




 I doubt he would bite on marshawn for gio and lacy but it never hurts to try. As far as the initial trade goes, it's definitely possible he bites on it, and I like it. Even for a guy I don't even really like, Lacy is a great buy low
