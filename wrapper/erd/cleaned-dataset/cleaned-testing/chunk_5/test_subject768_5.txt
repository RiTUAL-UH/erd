 aww, boo hoo, downvote my post. The mural is a lie, there is no jetpack in the game. The mural means nothing it's just somthing Rockstar put into the game for a joke. 









 P.S OP, how are we suppost to know these things if we are PC Gamers? What if we have never played a N64 before?

 I'm sure i'll be able to run it then at 30 atleast until i get my R9 270x 4GB Card. 




 DOWNLOAD PLZ 




 I'm just wondering because I have a desktop with a APU in it, my GPU broke and i'm waiting for a new one. I've seen the game run on an APU before, but not the 7700k. 




 For the sticker

I got this exact one 




 NICE 




 Well I can't afford a new PSU. :( I'm poor. PC Upgrades here in the UK are REALLY expensive. 




 PSU is brand new. It's a WinPower 500w PSU 




 I loud grinding noise that gets louder and louder just comes from my PSU randomly sometimes, I have to turn it off in fear, when I turn it back off again it's gone?! What the hell guys? I spent 500 on this PC. If I lose it now, i'm fucked. I'll have to go back to shitty xbox. 




 Aww, boohoo drown me in downvotes, I don't care. Just because I don't like a game you do, does not mean you have to downvote. or upvote for that fact. Ah do whatever the fuck you want i'm not your mother. 




 I just needed to vent. I'm tired of all this fallout 4 hype. 




 Yus. 




 I SEEN NIPPLES. 




 douchebag. 




 ALL GONE. FML.

 Well, I tried to cheer you guys up. 




 'shitty' even played it? 




 :o HD6allauhakbar 




 :D yay. Brighouse ftw. 




 Can't buy, as  I don't have a credit-card and this currently not in the CCL store near me. :C 




 OP approves. You get a [sticker](http://i.imgur.com/DHAR8WG.png) and a lollypop for being a good boy while you got your Karma Shots. 




 List some cheap mechanical keyboards in the UK, and I will love you forever.

 But you can do that here, to. 




 Wow. Maybe someday. But not today. 




 When I was at HighSchool I needed special needs. Every single kid picked on me. Every way they could. I wish I had friends like these guys back then. But nobody wanted to be friends with the kid with special needs. ;( 




 Hmm, the local CCL store sells Wirebrushes 




 I do, but my paintbrushes are in oil, because i'm an Artist, and the oil preserves the bristles, and cleans them. So I don't want to gunk up my heatsink/PC. I'll buy some Dust-Off tomorrow from STAPLES.  









 I'm not sure, I think it's the fan because of the dust I can see inside the heatsink. I have not removed it yet, because i'm afraid i'll break the CPU if I remove it. :S 




 My battlestation is making weird noises, It's like a VRRRR, it keeps getting louder, and louder, I panic'd and shut down the PC from the mains. :( I can't afford a repair! :C 




 What. TL:DR 




 I guess the peasants who live in the commonwealth were right about PC Gaming being too expensive.
