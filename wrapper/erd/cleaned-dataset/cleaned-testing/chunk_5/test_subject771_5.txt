 Nope.  If you have analog cable, you'll continue to receive it until your provider decides to shut it off.  There is no requirement for them to keep analog service on, but I still have analog service, and ClearQAM.  Note that they could have shut it off back in 2012 if they wanted to.  I get 63 analog channels, and 25 digital ones. :)  TWC actually does *something* right. :)

 A)  Back in the 90's they would have their asses kicked, (if outside of a gay bar, or a drag queen contest)

B) Trans-sexuals are mentally ill.  If I ever wonder what sex I am, I'll just look in my pants. Do I have a penis?  I'm a man.

C) I'd suck a lot of dick, and get fucked?  Hell if I know.  I've sort of wondered how it feels to take the D.

D)  Gay people are just gay.  I just don't care.  I'm not going to celebrate, or honor it.  I simply don't give a shit.  Big deal.  You're a dude and like other dudes.  Who cares?  But if you want to chop your penis off, you have mental problems. 




 A person is born (in most circumstances), as either XX, (female); or XY, (male).  No matter how much you mutilate yourself to suit your "self-image", you are what you are.  Getting your dick split in half and shoved inside of you, or constructing a penis out of I don't know what makes you no more male/female than me if I walked outside right now dressed in drag saying "I'm a chick now" with a full moustache.  It's not a biological problem; it is a mental problem, and they need heavy drugs and counseling.

 I tried to sign on with my TWC ID, but since I'm only an internet/phone subscriber, I don't get shit.  I want channel surfing, that's why I stay with TV service. How I get it, I honestly don't care.  I miss NTSC. :(  I miss rolloff, instead of this new "digital cliff"  Yeah, watching channels in B/W with almost no audio sucked, but better than nothing.  ATSC standards suck. :(  I'd like to bitch slap the asshole at the FCC who made this decision.  Here's my TV Fool:

  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a

I actually get KLEW and K40EE, but K40EE is turning off in a month, since it's still analog. :( 




 Why I still have traditional service?  Because I can just press "up" and watch something new without having to think about it.  No pre-scheduling, no "does thiis meet your standards", no "upvote".  Just change the channel if it sucks what your watching.  That's why I'll never get rid of TV service.  I'm trying to build a decent antenna, but I need to get this thing called a "combiner".  Fuck, antennas have changed a lot over the last 20 years.  Before, the bigger the better. and adjustable antennas were boss.  Now, amplified antennas are complete shit, and outdoor antennas can be used as indoor antennas?  It makes no sense.  Maybe I should go back to buiding my own like I did in the 90's? 




 Hmm. :)  Which Intel cards are compatible with this?  Or should I put up a large wifi Yagi?  I don't have an Xbox, (any generation), but I do have a phone, 2 TV's, laptop, and a desktop. 




 And sometimes they put in the wrong filters too. ;)  Other times, they're completly neglegent, and hook you right up to the line.  Othertimes, you just have basic cable tools, (torque wrench, terminator tool, P-Key), and you have cable access anyhow. ;) 




 That amplified antenna, (it was about as thick as 5 sheets of paper), didn't work at all.  Even PBS was pixilated, and I couldn't get jack shit with it.  Here is my [TV Fool](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a).  I also get KLEW and K40EE with a $9 antenna.  I have recently purchased the ClearStream1, and I have yet to test it.  I have it on a 6 foot pole, and need to figure out how to mount it on my roof, (without a ladder). 




 Back in 1999, I did.  But I thought in that movie, humans were powercells, not just a heater? 




 Thanks!  Does this also explain why when there are a large amount of humans in a room, that room is actually hot compared to the rest of the building?  So humans are like portable furnaces that can walk and talk and breathe?

 I don't put on any facade.  I'm 32 years old and independent.  If they don't like my decisions, tough titties for them. 




 Because it makes good TV. 




 AIDS. 




 The amplified antenna that I tried didn't work for shit, but the cheap ass RCA 112F works fine to get 6 channels. 




 Yes, it was one of those flat antennas that you can mount to your wall, or window, or just set it on a desk.  It didn't work for shit.  I now have a cheap ass set of rabbit ears on my downstairs TV, and get 6 channels.  I have to figure out how to mount my Clearview1 to the top of the roof though.  I have it on a 6 foot pole, I just have to figure out how to get up there without a ladder truck. 




 My parents and grandparents actually used large ariels mounted on 50 foot poles.  That was the only way we could pick up anything.  I grew up 16 miles from the nearest town with over 10000 people.  I now live in a small town of only 30000 people.  The nearest city with over 100,000 people is over 75 miles away from me.

I actually pick up KLEW, and K40EE, (although K40EE is going dark in July).  I just returned the amplfied antenna for the Clearview1, and I'm going to see how that works.  I just have to set up a mount for it.  I need a bucket, and some gravel. 




 Yes, I had it plugged in, and it didn't make a damned bit of difference.  I took it back and exchanged it for a ClearStream 1.  I haven't done a channel scan with it yet, but it should work, considering the cheap-o RCA indoor antenna actually works, (and the Clearstream 1 has good reviews on Amazon.com) 




 Because invisible pink unicorns are always talking. 




 How is this news? Liberals run on nothing but feelings, logic be damned. 




 And still applies. 









 I bought a $9 set of rabbit ears with a UHF loop on it, and an amplified antenna at WM for $49.95,  The amplified antenna can't pick up anything, but the rabbit ears let me pull in 6 channels, (4 of them PBS, ABC (analog), and CBS).  So what is the point of amplified indoor antennas when they don't pick up anything, and actually perform worse than a standard set of rabbit ears? 




 Probably a couple of hours.

 When we lose, the streets are quiet, but when we win, College hill all fucking night long can be located by a blind man going to the sound of the "WOOO!  GO COUGS!"  (I've participated when I was really drunk, and even shot off fireworks.  The neighbors didn't like explosives too much, and the cops only told me to stop shooting off mortars, [after watching me light up the block for about 20 min]  {Yes, I have a lot of fireworks}.). :D  I shoot off fireworks because our football team sucks so much for the last 2 years, that ANY win is a good win, and mortars get launched, (which is why I probably have the cops called on me).

 12/23/10 just flashed before my eyes.  Pulling up to the intersection, and expecting to stop.  OH SHIT!!  NO BRAKES!!  BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEP!  I CAN"T STOP!  OH FUCK  DO I SIDESWIPE CARS?  NO!  NEUTRAL  NEUTRAL NEUTRAL!  dump clutch EEEEEEEEEE!  CLUNK!  no sound  OH FUCK! stop in the middle of the road XXX-XXX-XXXX Dad!  Emergency!  I need new brakes.  I just lost my brakes and almost killed a man!  TOW ME TO LES SCHWAB!"

That was a $7500 rebuild.  Nothing is more scary than trying to come to a stop normally, and **NOTHING HAPPENS**!  That's some scary shit!  O.o 




 I'd just be confused at that point, wondering why are they coming in here, and direct them to my neighbors.  They're the ones that do illegal shit not me.  Hell, the pizza guys can't even get the right house, so I don't blame you.  Tell you what.  I have keys to the electricity.  I'll shut them off for you.  (if you let me go back to bed).  Seriously, I do have access to the electric box, and if you let me sleep, I'll shut off their power for you. :) 




 I know that's very illegal, (at least in WA and ID), so I don't think anybody would be ballsy enough to impersonate a marked police vehicle, but undercovers?  That's easy.  Hell, I already look like a WSU maintenence vehicle, (from the dealership, I didn't get custom paint), minus the orange globe on top.  I can already drive basically wherever I want on WSU, so long as I abide by maintenance vehicle restrictions, it's not hard to get away with driving on "authorized vehicles and pedestrians only" roads, or on sidewalks, or up stairs, or anywhere I want to go.  

I've parked for HOURS directly across from the police department, and nobody cared.  No citations, no towing, nothing.  Not even a note.  I just drove like I was supposed to be there.  Of course, I used to work there, and am well aware of how maintenance vehicles are supposed to drive on "closed" roads, so abide by that, and no problems.  

Yes, I only did it when I had a good reason to, (wife was 8 months pregnant, and she can't walk up hills without risking falling over).  But without modifications, I can easily pass as a maintenance vehicle at WSU.  I even got Whitman County to drop a couple of "illegal parking" tickets, because I had a pregnant wife who couldn't walk more than 30 yards.  She had door to door service.  I drove anywhere I wanted, just abiding by the maintenance vehicle code.

Park outside the CUB for a couple hours?  Not a problem.  Drive down the chipman trail on WSU?  Not a problem.  I only got "illegal parking" when I using all the powers of dumbassery parked on the steps.  (people were in my way, so I couldn't park on level ground).  (yes, I know it wasn't very smart parking on stairs, because if my e-brake failed, it would cause at least 100 deaths, I got lectured by the judge on that one).  But as long as I wasn't dangerously parked, nobody cared at all, or even noticed my vehicle). 




 They work fine for me.  So yes, I do. 




 Yes.  If blue things are appearing red, you're approaching c, and you're going WAY TOO FAST!  (if the 60 mile radius around us survives, you'll get the highest ticket in history). 




 Cause I was 19 at the time, and had no clue (still don't), what they do with a road kill animal, (well, "almost-kill" [it was parylized when I saw it, so I shot it because it was suffering]).  I didn't want it, so I told them to give it to the battered women's shelter, (hey, they need meat), since I don't want it to go to waste.  Yes, I shot it, but from the front of the vehicle that collided with it, and the deer, it was obvious that I wasn't poaching.  I just had to unload, (not hard, it was a single shot), and give them the spent shell.  I kept my .410, and they sent me on my way.  I'll never forget that "conversation".  

"Did you see anything?"

"Yes.  I deer stumbling in the road, and a wrecked car.  These people pointing to the people looking on were in the car."

"Did you do anything?"

"Asked if they were OK.  They don't seem to need medical attention.  I shot the deer."

"I'm sorry, you did what?"

"I shot the deer.  It looked to be parylized.  I shot it in the head and put it out of it's misery.  The deer is over here".

"Sir, what did you shoot it with?  It seems to missing about a quarter of the left side of it's head."

"My SS .410"  The shell is over there"

"OK.  I'm going to need the shell you have loaded, and I need to inspect your weapon"

"OK"

...

"It seems everything checks out.  Do you wish to keep this animal?"

"No, give it to the battered women's shelter or something.  I don't want it.  I just didn't want it to suffer."

"Here is your shotgun.  Please do not load it, and have a good day sir."

 I flip a Uie, and go back to town 




 Personally, if somebody burst in here, the threat would be stopped, and you'll be chasing somebody neutralized.  (or not chasing him as the case may be).  Hopefully once he realized he had nowhere to run, or use force against, he would surrender and play "spider on the ground", but I'm prepared if I need to be, (legally, I don't violate the NFA, or any state statutes).  If all I have to yell is "HEY!" and they run off, good!

Shit, now the police reaction to me pulling up to WaMu to have my wife get money out of the ATM makes sense.  I pulled up, and I saw several patrol vehicles there, and didn't think anything of it.  Wife got out of the car, and I was sitting in the seat smoking.  Officer walks by and asks what I'm doing, so I told him, "my wife wants some cash from the ATM and she's right there", [literally right in front of me].

He told me to stay in the vehicle, and walked off carrying an AR in a 1pt sling in low ready.  I don't know where the hell he was going, but he seemed like he was on a mission.  Yes, I stayed in the vehicle.  I didn't really think much of it beyond "this is odd".  To this day, I still don't even know what the hell I rolled up on.  The bank was closed, so it couldn't have been a bank robbery.  Training thing maybe?  That's the only thing I can think of.

 




 Just a normal cop car without lights?  Doesn't make me nervous, I've just never seen one before besides earlier today.  I thought it was strange.  I was airing up my tires, and saw it pass by.  It looked strange to me, since I expect cop cars to have a light bar like ambulances or fire trucks.  Emergency vehicles = lightbar, as far as I'm concerned.  I saw one without one, so I wondered why that car exists, (since I never saw one before).  It made me look twice.  I didn't think much of it beyond "Hmm, weird.  33 lbs, 35 lbs .... 50 lbs... OH SHIT!  Pfffffffffff. 44 lbs.  Cool.  On to the next tire." 




 OK, that explains why you carry SMG's. :)  What do you do if you come across people sleeping who don't know what the hell is going on, and don't even know who you are?  Yeah, I assume you announce "XXX County Sheriff", but what if they are like "OK, why are you here?" and they honestly have no idea why you're there, because they weren't doing anything besides sleeping?  I guess what I'm asking is "what if you get the wrong house?"  Or what if you do have the wrong house, you burst in, and you hear "WHO'S IN MY HOUSE!?  I'M ARMED!  LEAVE NOW!! I'M CALLING 911!" 




 I don't like the slick top rigs because I could EASILY do that myself (if I had enough money).  I drive a crimson and grey 97 Blazer LT, and it looks enough like a WSU rig that I get no shit if I drive on "authorized vehicles only" roads up at WSU.  I've parked for a couple hours, and locked my rig, and nobody touched it, or ticketed me, or even left me a note.  I look like a normal WSU maintenance vehicle minus the orange globe on top.  I've done nothing special to my rig beyond "buy it from the dealer", but I can pass as a WSU maintenance vehicle, when I'm directly parked across the street from the police department.

The only thing visually seperating me from a WSU Police vehicle?  No light bar, no large aerials, no state plates, and no push bar.  The only thing separating me from a maintenance vehicle?  No orange orb.  But if I wanted all of that shit, if I had about $3000, nobody would be able to tell the difference, (besides the logos of the local police).  [That's not too hard to get](http://www.decaldriveway.com/) if I wanted to.

Just knowing how easy it would be to impersonate a police officer if if I felt so inclined, (NO I DON'T!), and just a normal passenger vehicle can be easily passed off as a maintenance vehicle makes me have reservations about unmarked vehicles.  Hell, I don't even need an orange globe to drive wherever I want on WSU campus, I just have to drive like I work there, and am on official business, (less than 15 MPH at all times, and when pedestrians are present, less than 5 MPH).  Of course, it does help that I used to work there in maintenance, so I know the procedures for driving on "Pedestrian Only:  Closed to traffic except for authorized vehicles" road.

Also, the one time I got pulled over for jumping a red, (didn't run it, jumped it, (treated it as a 4 way, and went for it), I actually purposly went to the center lane, turned on my 4 ways, and drove to the nearest gas station and parked under the fueling area.  I didn't see him, so I didn't know who was trying to pull me over.  I made sure that the stop was on video tape, because I didn't know who was stopping me or why.  (I fucked up, and jumped the red), and got let go).  [not doing that again, and the officer gave me a good reason why]  "What if I was trying to get on to the road?  You obviously didn't see me, so what else could you have missed?"  Want to kill somebody today?"  I had no answer for that, and I don't jump reds anymore. 




 But what do you use them for?  I carry a sidearm on my person, (so I don't get killed if somebody shoots at me, at least I'll have a fighting chance), and a .410 in case I come across road almost-kill, (I've had to use it before), but why an MP5?  Do you have to do residential breeches or something?  Surely it's not to send roadkill to meet it's maker?  Yeah, if somebody's shooting at you, I fully expect you to shoot back, but why a SMG?  What do you use them for?  (yay for WA, they let you keep roadkill if you want it).  No, I didn't keep it, I told the officer to give it to the battered women's shelter or whatever they do with it.  I only shot it because it was going to die anyways, and I didn't want it to suffer.  My only word to the deer was "sorry".  BANG!  (after I distracted the kids at the scene by having them look at the "pretty mountain, isn't it pretty how all that snow is up there?  Just think about sledding.") 




 *cough* only the asians, and the seattleites. *cough*  If it snows 2", expect numerous slide offs, and drive EXTREMELY defensively.  (sign says 35, go 30.  Sign says 55, go 45).  Seattleites can't drive worth shit.  Empty roads, and shit conditions?  I actually obey the speed limit. (unless it's foggy, I've went 20 in a 55 before, because I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me, and assholes wouldn't pass, and lined up behind me because I was "making way".  I could barely see where I was going), and still almost got into a head-on.  I found myself in the center lane before a car passed me in the opposite direction, and wondered "why is that car so close to me?"  I had drifted over to the center turn lane, and had it not been for the rumble strips, a very bad accident would have happened that night.  That was scary.  I should have just stopped. 




 They have submachine guns?  Shit, no wonder why the officer was watching exactly what I was doing when I said "Hey, can I sit behind the wheel?"  His response was "Uhh, sure, just don't start it."  WTF do you need an Uzi for?  AR15's I can understand, (what if you're in a shooting, and you need to "reach out and touch somebody"?  But SMG?  What the hell for?  (honest question). 




 SWAT uses patrol cars?  I thought they used those converted APC's?  I've sat behind the wheel of one, (no they wouldn't let me even fire it up), and it was cool, but from the "test" I did on the seat, (bouncing up and down on it), I wouldn't want to drive that fucker.  It felt like a really shitty grain truck with bad seat springs. (just sitting behind the wheel and looking around the cab seeing what lacks).  They don't even have an AM radio in that thing!  That rig must be boring to drive. (and hell on your ass). 




 Do drivers recognize that you're a patrol vehicle when you light them up, or think you're some asshole pranking as a cop so they pull over so assumed asshole can blow by them at highway speeds?  (serious question)  

If I got stopped by one of those "concealed light" rigs, I would slow down, call 911, turn on my 4 ways, and proceed to the nearest well lit area before stopping.  No light bar on top?  I'm not stopping.  How do I know you're not some dickhole who likes making people shit a brick for no reason?  

In my book, cop cars have lights on the top.  Concealed bars are about one step above some random driver trying to get me to stop for I don't know why.  Undercover vehicles?  (no markings), I'm going to pull over in a well lit area, where there are plenty of witnesses, and I'm calling 911.  Any joe schmoe on the internet can buy red and blues if he wants, and sirens aren't that hard to obtain either.  All you need is [internet access](http://www.thefirestore.com/store/category.aspx/categoryId/528/Emergency-Lights-and-Sirens/).  I don't trust unmarked vehicles. 




 There's a guy that drives one of those, but his is painted all white.    He doesn't have ariels, or state plates, and has holes where the push bar used to be.  I know that guy, and he just uses it as a daily commute vehicle.  But for some reason, they left the spotlights on it instead of carrying a spotlight in their vehicle like a normal person. He lives up at CCN.  I've pulled him out of the ditch a couple of times, because he drives like shit. 




 Painted dark blue, and it says "Pullman Police Department" on the side, and gives the business number?  Wouldn't that be VERY illegal?  It was identical to this car, but no lightbar on top.

 Yes, it is. It's also known as the Doppler effect. 




 I regularly did 1600 SPH, and 5.5 SPI. 




 Bad enough that I had to speed to a station in town, and couldn't make it to the doors, so I stopped as soon as I got off of the street, and pissed right there in front of god and everybody. I simply couldn't hold it any longer. I was starting to piss in my driver's seat. 




 Evolution. 




 That's what the bin next to the quarters are for. 




 You could leave your house unlocked, and windows open while you sleep, and wouldn't worry about getting robbed.

You could leave your windows down, keys in the ignition, and truck running while going into the store for a little bit, and not worry if your rig will still be there when you get out. The most that would happen is somebody might turn your ignition off, figuring you forgot about it.

If you broke down along the road, people would actually stop and see if they could help you, instead of just driving by and pretending they didn't see you.

Children were expected to behave, and bad behavior in public settings such as restaurants and stores was not tolerated by either the general public, or the parents.

Children could go to the store, or park without parental escort; and nobody thought twice about a child unattended taking a city bus. CPS didn't get involved because you let your children have some independence.

If it was during school hours, and children were seen roaming the street, it wasn't uncommon to ask them "Shouldn't you be in school?" or "Do you need a ride to school?"

If children missed the bus to school, they were expected to walk, (or take their bike), to school; not call mommy and daddy at work to get a ride.

Perpetual victimhood was frowned upon. Yeah, you got a raw deal. Everybody has something to bitch about. Life isn't fair, get used to it.

No participation trophies. You deserve praise because you accomplished something, or went above and beyond the call of duty. Not simply because you breathe free air. 

In the game of life, there are winners and losers. Regardless how hard you try, you still may not succeed. You didn't win. Sorry, you lost. Yes, you may have tried. That doesn't make you a "winner in your heart", you are still a loser in the game of life, but at least you lost with dignity.

Please and thank you were common, and expected. It used to be considered common courtesy to hold open a door for the elderly, ladies, infirmed, people in a rush, and people carrying things. 

Also offering them a buggy, or taking it back into the store for them used to be a kind gesture that wasn't expected.  It was polite, not "rude", "demeaning", or "mysoganist".

People had a sense of community, and you knew your neighbors, and they knew you. You could ask them for help, and they could of you too. It might be as simple as, "hey, I'm going on vacation for a week, can you water my lawn?" Or something like "I just bought a new couch, and I need help getting it out of my truck. Can you help?". People were glad to help.

Fortunately, I still live in one of these areas. All of America should be like this. 




 The holey buy-bull and Kent Hovind said so. 




 Not really, there's people obsessed with exercise.  Exercise isn't a drug. 




 They are drugs.

*"a medicine or other substance (which is not food or water), which has a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body."* 




 Good reasons. :)  I'm happy with my VCR.  It works fine for me. 




 I have my DTV box feeding into my VCR, and from there, into my TV.  It works fine for my purposes. 




 That explains it.  Thanks!  I saw it driving by today while I was airing up my tires, and I thought it was strange, so I asked here why those cars exist.  To quote NBC:  "The More You Know..." :) 




 I was a teen when it first came out.  I stopped watching it after a dude was forced to give a BJ, and chomped the dudes dick off, then spit it in his face.  I decided I didn't want to see that, so I changed the channel, (Sat G5, T15, C-Band).  

It's worth watching as an adult, but not for kids.  The pacific is gory, but it's good. :)  I have all 3 series on my computer.  Hell, I have enough video on my computer I could run a TV station. 




 So it's just a normal police car?  Do they even have lights?  I was airing up my tires today and one drove by.  It looked like the FD car, but had the police paint on it.  I thought it was strange. 




 Ah.  So that's like the boss's company car?   














 The liberal media lies, and presents a view point that bolsters thier POV without regards to the facts of the case. 




 What ever happened to just using a VCR?  (serious question)  Walmart still sells blank tapes.  http://www.walmart.com/ip/10980689?reviews_limit=9  




 Band of Brothers is good.  Have you watched The Pacific yet?  That's good too.  So is Oz. 




 Well shit.  There's not much there that I would actually bother watching.  :(  Fuck, I hate the DTV conversion. :(  I used to get 13 channels with an indoor antenna. :( 














 To the East, there are several mountains in the way, (over 4500 feet high).  To the north, there is a change in elevation of a thousand feet, and down in the LC valley where channel 3 is, is a fall of about 2000 feet.  There are basically no broadcast towers to the west of me.

Is it possible to convert a direcTV dish to FreeSat?  Or would I need to put in a new dish?  And if I did this, would I be able to get american TV like ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox, UPN, CW? 




 Shit. Even if I could put up a radio tower of 500 feet, I still wouldn't be able to pick up much.:

 If you have a dick, you're a man. Use the men's room. 




 Not keep up on fluid levels and tire pressure. 




 Such as:

"If this text is red, you are going TOO FAST!" (printed in blue)

"If you can read this bumper sticker, you at too close!" (printed in 8pt font) 




 Well shit.  It looks like I'm stuck on cable/satellite. :( 




 Art actually looks like something, and is aesthetically pleasing.  "art" looks like it could have been made by a retarded baboon tripping out on LSD and shrooms at the same time. 




 She hasn't learned how to write yet. 




 Nothing. 




 I was high last night. 




 2 inch high. 




 I used to work as a cashier, and we don't give a shit what you buy. 




 By bullshitting, listening to the radio, looking out the window, and sleeping. 




  If you do the math, there's plenty of time to be enrolled FT, and work FT.  There are 168 hours in a week.

    12 hours of class
    12 hours of study
    40 hours to work
    56 hours to sleep
    10 hours to eat
    3 hours to keep house
    14 hours to relax
    Total hours used per week:  147
    Total hours per week: 168
    Total hours left unused:  21

That gives you 21 hours to socialize.  If you do this, not only will you pass, but you won't have a damned bit of debt when you graduate, and will still have time to make friends. 




 The internet. 




 Get a job, work your way through school. 




 Das Kapital. 




 Head On! Apply directly to the forehead! Head On! 




 I'd kill **him**.

FTFY. 




 Yes.  




 Nothing. He died in 2010. 




 She could have fixed it, either by buying a new knob, or fill it full of superglue, and stick the fucker on there.  It won't come off again. :)

Or am I stuck on cable and satellite? 
 




 ST: TNG 




 Locking pliers are your friend. :)  Put the pliers on there, and now you have a knob again, (well, a lever). It's ugly as hell, but it works. :)  My mother had a TV much like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/HsVKffV.jpg), with [this cable box](http://i.imgur.com/lvZRQVg.jpg) 




 You can [turn a dial](http://i.imgur.com/T8RHEdc.jpg) with just one finger?  You must have a strong finger! :) 




 The ["Zenith Space Command"](http://i.imgur.com/zIMWfZ6.jpg) remote control [came out in 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control#Television_remote_controls), and gave us the term "clicker".  Zenith also introduced the first wired remote in 1950.

 




 Yes, he did.

*"In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there."*

**--Philo Farnsworth, "I Have a Secret" (1957)** 




 Yes, it does.  Paste 1000110001101010001 here:

 I've never actually seen somebody, (kid, or otherwise), write a backwards E, S, or R, (unless they were purposely doing it).  But that explains it. :) 




 How would television have been different? 




 Ah.  That explains it.  But why the backwards E?  Does he think it's cute or something?  Besides, what 5yo knows the word "nigh", and the cursive G? 




 "the child"

*Riiiight*..... 




 People chewing with their mouths open. 




 Not flushing the fucking toilet in public bathrooms. 




 Specifically this:

The kid can spell "nigh", but writes backward E's?  Come on.  Yeah right.  It's obvious that whoever put this page up just wants a cheap laugh.  No 5 year old kid is that dumb, (and smart at the same time). 




 Make illegal:  Being able to vote without having passed the US Citizenship test.  I would make it a requirement to do so before being granted the right to vote.

Make legal:  Shopping in businesses, and eating in restaurants without shoes or a shirt on.

 Replicators. 




 Always finish a blowjob. 




 No. 




 I think it's likely going to be Hillary on the Democratic side, and Bush or Rand Paul on the Republican side.  God, I hope it's not Bush.  I like Rand Paul, as he's a "hands-off" republican.  I've had enough of the dual-family dynasty. 




 How many people can you name off of the top of your head? 50? 100? Cool. Now think about this. There are over 7 billion people in the world, and you  only know of less than 0.00001% of them. You are no different. For most people in the world, you may as well not exist. 




 Whenever they're old enough to work, and earn enough money to buy one.

 I mostly liked Ron Paul in 2012, but I didn't bother supporting him.  Why?  He had a snowball's chance in hell of winning.  I was going for gingrich, because I wanted to see him take on Obama in the debates.  But then the RINO Romney won the nomination, so I held my nose and voted for the moron mormon.  There is no point in supporting a candidate who cannot win 




 Beer for a 3 month period. 




 Why support a candidate that cant win? 




 LOL!  No. 




 There's a difference between towing them out of the ditch because they couldn't handle the road (driving reasonably), or because the snow was too deep to ford in the vehicle, (been there, done that); versus hiring a lawyer for them to fight a speeding ticket, so they don't have to pay more for insurance.  They got the ticket, they pay it.  And since they're paying their own insurance anyways, they'll learn rather quickly not to speed. 




 Bills, and not knowing where I'm going to get enough money to keep the cable on.  I was shut off for 4 weeks, and was within 12 hours of having my power shut off.
