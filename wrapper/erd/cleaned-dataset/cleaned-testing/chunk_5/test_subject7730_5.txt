 When trying to uninstall, it seems like I check the box of a folder that I am SURE I didn't download and that seems suspicious, but when I click uninstall it doesn't do anything. I'll click uninstall multiple times and wait for 10-15 min and still nothing. Checked my extensions and nothing their that is suspicious, just google slides, sheets, and docs. 




 Hello, recently my Chrome is being affected by a virus of sorts that always appears when i search something on google, it brings up suggestions that says 'Ads by SuperAdRemoval' as you can see on the photo.

It doesn't appear on my extensions and on the control panel of programs so i have no idea on how to remove this virus?!

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

 You must pick it up, find his sponge companion, swim above the bikini bottom and shoot the sponge and starfish along with a crown-like object utilizing nothing but your chest in order to stop plankton and the bucketheads. Fufill your destiny. 




 Difference between having a sense of humor and being funny. Not Hating. 




 I wanna be mode like Woody. 




 No, whenever he brings up the topic about companies with names without meaning, he always mentions Seananners, Pepsi, and Cisco. If you're a PKA Historian then you heard him talk about this topic like 5-6 times already. He doesn't know that Cisco stems from that. 




 I love Movie Fights by the screen junkies! #3!

 Well...you can burn trees, but you can't burn steel beams. So the question we should really be asking is, Can steel beams live forever? 




 A lost dog strays into a jungle. A lion sees this from a distance and says with caution "this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before". So the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. The dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly "mmm...that was some good lion meat!". The lion abruptly stops and says " woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can". Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together". So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago... 




 When did he say that? smells like BS to me. 




 They are long gone friend...Prank calls, hilarious untold stories, and Wings of Redemption. Those are all done. 




 No bad at all. Could be mastered a bit better and randomizing the velocity of the hi-hats would give a less robotic sound to something more human. 




 Where do I download? 




 So I can just add it like I do all my other vst's to FL. No alternative method to add it? 




 Murkah is my favorite host/guest. But where I think many might get confused with my comment is that Wings brought a certain type of spontaneous entertainment and hilaritiy. And, yes most of the time we would laugh at him but that was what cause most of the best moments on the show ever. Seriously go watch some 'Funniest moments of PKA' videos on youtube 90% the funny spawned from Wings. I love Murkah but he's more intellectual and calculated with his sarcastic remarks. Murkah is my favorite host/guest of every single person whose been on PKA but no one truly can replace or replicate what wings did for the show.

 Can you run that through FL Studio? 




 Should I be downloading Windows Installer or No Installer for TDR Kotelnikov?

 Everywhere I try to get Camel Crusher redirects me to weird pages. Do you know where I can get it?

 Love this community! Thank you all for posting, you guys are awesome! 




 Seriously what? 




 I use FL Studio. Love the fruity filter, reverb 2, delay 2, but I would love for some alternative filters and compressors to get some variety or better quality
