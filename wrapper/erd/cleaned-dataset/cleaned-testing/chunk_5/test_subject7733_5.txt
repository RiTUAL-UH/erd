 Pink Floyd, baby, best band ever :)

EDIT: Considering that I got downvoted in less than a minute, makes me think otherwise :'( 




 My favorite song hands down off Dark Side, no question about it. Listening to that solo in the right environment is a border line religious experience. Also the lyricism in this song is so superb, and it's genius for them to do the Breathe Reprise, I absolutely love this tune. 




 cheers mate 




 Do you know of any site or anything that can give me a guide or anything like that? 




 And that is sick, how much would a fella have to pay you to make another one? 




 Interesting, It seems like if you wanted to know about the real details of the band, you'd have to be already involved in reading music articles and such. I'm sure a lot of people were unaware of the falling out. 




 It's definitely easy for me to forget and overlook how much the Internet has really revolutionized media and information gathering in our world and that it wasn't to the scale that it is today. 




 Brandon Flowers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse 




 As you can see, less than half my artists have had an album come out in 2014, but thats all good. I finally listened to artists that I never really listened to before and I loved them. I might also add youtube links to some songs from these artists :) 

* 1) Pink Floyd - knew about them of course, really delved into their material and was blow away, I consider them one of my favorite bands of all-time. I even enjoyed The Endless River, to a certain extent, even though a lot of people didn't as much. I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums


* 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well


* 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom


* 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"

* 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly


* 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project

* 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy. She's my guilty pleasure - come hate me haha


*  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me


* 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig

* 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans. Flicker is my favorite song because I'm an Eyedea fan, so I thought it was a great song. I also started listening to his older discog a bit more, and I think Slug can straight spit fire

 




 I was born in '93, well after the PF break-up, and from what it seems, the PF break-up was popular news and shown in the media. (This could be wrong, I'm not sure how well covered it was by media outlets.) I was just wondering if there was anyone on here that had first hand accounts of watching this legendary band slowly and publicly fall out with each other (I know all the members weren't on the forefront). Basically I want to know how heartbreaking it was to watch Waters and Gilmour fight over something so revered. 




 thanks man, I'll pm ya next time instead of making a post, thanks for taking care of things though, much appreciated  




 I use it as my quick reference for the game times and future matches, I'm sorry if I'm unaware of any system that goes into updating (like updated every 2 weeks or such) 




 Team Baby-Afros!!! Let's fucking gooooo 




 You're right, that's why I do listen to the entire album when I study, it just flies right on by 









 Frusciante's guitar in Central is also wicked, that's my favorite song from his solo work 




 I think they've also used RHCP songs, I can't remember exactly which ones. But I remember Flea was pretty upset for obvious reasons, his music is meant to make people happy and inspire them, not make them go insane. ( Even though the song Easily makes me go insane( in a good way though)) Could anyone be so kind to fact check me on this? I'm on my phone and can't really navigate as easily. 




 Wet sand for Frusciante,and Alive for McCready are amazing  




 I'm a mess 




 No order

* David Gilmour (Never heard anyone manipulate a guitar and sounds quite like him)

* Jimi Hendrix (obvious, also he played a right-handed guitar upside down, need I say more)

* Pete Townshend (One of my favorite older rockers with some iconic moves that I love)

* Mike McCready (Pearl Jam's guitarist, I think he's very underrated, probably not top 5 all time, but he's in my list because I just love his solos)

* Jimmy Page (Double neck motha fuckaaaaassssss)

* John Frusciante ( I can't believe I forgot him in my original group :( ... He's literally one of my favorite people on the face of the planet)

EDIT: Woops I only did 5, so I added the 6th and messed up a bunch of spelling  




 I like this album more than piper, I still need to give it more listens, but I do find it enjoyable. OBC in my opinion is PFs most underrated album though 




 Sounds good 




 Is it Day 56? 




 Ahhh yes it's an American bookstore actually, I'm not sure how original they are though, I doubt they are original pressings. And good luck mate 




 You can get Dark side of the moon from barns and noble lol 




 Ughhh this conversation has come up once or twice already in the past week, please use the search on this subreddit 

EDIT: okay, downvote me because I wish for a variety of conversations... 




 *eating of popcorn intensifies* 




 ZING! 




 Word, we're all floydians here, much love homie 




 Cocks out lads! 




 I mean, I didn't downvote him, so I assume people are because he just kind of disagreed in a short manner without much of an explanation. Thats not good conversation 101 amigo 




 Yeah I found this so compelling, I try to share it with people whenever I can 




 Eddie Vedder is one of my most respected artist's, this 6 minute condensed version of an interview has swelled tears in my eyes so many times. What a great human being.

[Pearl Jam interview with Steve Gleason (former NFL player suffering from ALS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLHPm_8_Yis)
 




 Every verse is so potent 









 That's like... your opinion man... 




 Can't forget Poles Apart, or Wearing the inside out, or coming back to life.. shit... the whole album is great 




 Actually, Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 doesn't really do much for me. I agree that TDB beats The Wall as a whole. And I also agree that Comfortably Numb absolutely outclasses anything on TDB. My favorite part on The Wall is Nobody Home through Comfortably Numb, other than that, I only revisit the album for Hey You, and sometimes Young Lust. 




 I think it's true about music companies wanting to slap old rock bands names onto an album to make nostalgia money.... but I love The Division Bell, it'd make more sense if it was about The Endless River, but it's not. The Division Bell is a fantastic album that I like more than The Wall. SO YEAH. 




 Spongebob bubble bowl band anyone? This list is egregious! 




 I will take you out to Ruth crists steakhouse  




 LET ME RUB YOUR ASS, GOD DAMMIT 




 Can I get a trial? It's only fair  




 Can I rub your ass then? 




 It seems that both albums are necessary as a precept for Dark Side, however, I'm not sure how OBC would have changed things if released before meddle. It's weird to think that OBC should have been released beforehand, as it has more of the psychedelic feel like ASoS or AHM. Meddle seems almost out of place because it's harder rock feel with One of these days and Echoes. I think if meddle wasn't released then OBC would be looked at with greater regard but I think echoes completely overshadows it. It's too much of a powerhouse song for the pre-dark side era. 




 I think I just cried for you, the disappointment :( 




 I haven't delved into their discography yet, any recommendations? 




 Fizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 




 My friend just showed me this song the other, and I love it!!!

I knew I loved it when he said, "and don't fucking move" 

I love nothing more than a good use of the word, "fuck" in a passionate song
 




 and yet you don't even give me an upvote -.- 




 Is this real? I spot a couple footballers in Giggs and Cambiasso. Bertrand del is a bit of a stretch for a footballer, but come on laddie! I also spot a Ramos and Ruiz and oh fuck there's Rambo. AND THERES COSTA (CFC) 




 FUCK! I GUESSED SHMELLOW 




 I don't know how else to ask this, so I'm gonna be rather blunt, and excuse my french. But... what exactly is your favorite color?
 




 Quite frankly I think it's way too early to predict the longevity of this album... It's been out for a month. Sure it probably won't be one of the most influential albums ever or ever stand toe-to-toe with other PF classics, but I think pretty much every PF has a time and place for the most part. I think Obscured by Clouds is one of PF's most underrated albums by far, that doesn't mean it's not a timeless and important album in the PF story. I feel like this is a good ending to the historic career of PF, few words are needed and the music speaks for itself.


EDIT: this isn't meant to sound confrontational, I just think its a bit premature to predict what people will be listening to in 2049. Heaven knows I'll be old as shit blasting PF as the 'young thugs' play their beeps and boops 




 This song needs to be 35 minutes long! 




 :( b-b-b-but (pun intended) I'll be your substitute 




 This. This is what I meant to put. 




 I think I enjoy more than most people on this sub to be honest, I think this album has great moments on each 'side'.  It's what we do is great, sum and skins go so well together, I absolutely love anisina. I also love allons-y 1 through allons-y 2, and then I thought side 4 was really good top, perhaps the best (3 and 4 are tied) however I did find that it's more of a situational album for me than their other albums. I can usually only pop TER while doing hw or studying, but for those situations I think it's a great album. 




 If we play that kind of D all year, we can make some ripples in the big 12, make some things interesting and get a good bid for the tourney 




 Open your heart, I'm coming home *cue a solo that gives feels*
 




 Holy fucking defense batman 




 Bench

Mourinho's personal ass rubber

Old enough not to get Mourinho prosecuted by the police

Signed from abroad, I'm the best ass rubber in the world

 




 Bass 'Colton' Ricks put an end to that belief mighty quickly 




 The pic of David and Nick makes me sad
 




 you promised not to tell anyone 




 Thanks man, this should be more than enough to help me delve into it more
 




 That comfortably numb solo has been known to impregnate woman who even just listen to the full thing (Snapple fact, I'm sure of it) 




 Really really, Blues really isn't a very familiar genre of mine, but I enjoy SVR 




 Poor David is always stuck with asshole frontmen :/ haha how about we give him someone nice for once? 




 * David Gilmour - Guitar/Vocals
* Roger Waters - bassist/Vocals
* Richard Wright - keyboardist
* Nick Mason - drums


No... no they would not get along, at least not all of them. 




 I can dig it, I haven't heard of him. Seems like a great suggestion thus far. Thanks! 




 A-ha! I love telling people how I go into rock (specifically classic rock). The short answer School of Rock... now hear me out. I was in like 7th grade at the time, probably younger when I first watched it to be honest. But the scene where "My Brain is Hanging Upsidedown" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black did that montage with teaching all the kids about the history of rock and how to play. I don't know... as a young kid learning about music, I realized, "holy shit, there's a lot more complexity to music and influences than I realized." So I began with just a lot of classic rock for many and many years, now I branched out a great deal since then. But Pink Floyd is still the greatest band ever :P 




 Copper Gone by Sage Francis, underrated angry rapper that used to be a slam poet, this guy's lyricism is next to none. 




 Okay I have two questions that are pretty short, sweet and to the point. They are also unrelated so don't assume I'm gonna try to make any observations about these fellas.

* Can anyone recommend some really strong electrically driven blues music like Stevie Ray Vaughan? I've heard some other blues, but I don't really attack onto them like I do SVR's, I like guitar that just rips through songs.


* Also, I've only listened to Tom Waits very briefly and saw on here his Rain Dogs album mentioned. I'm listening to it and I'm about halfway through. What should I be listening for in particular. Usually when I listen to new stuff I have it on in the background and just listen to the music, and not necessarily the lyrics. But this seems like an album that I need to listen to the narrative that he generates. So should I give this album more attention, or is there another reason that people have recommended it? 




 Pink Floyd: Us and Them (as mentioned below), Gunner's Dream, Two Suns in the Sunset, Wearing the Inside Out, Shine on you Crazy Diamond, Dogs of War (not particularly fond of this song, but there's no denying the groovy saxiness at about the 4 min mark), Anisina (off The Endless River, one of my favorite tracks from that album)


CHECK DEEZ OUT HOMIE!


EDIT: Forgot Money  




 RES"ERECTION" 




 Nothing says I love jesus while raving with a girls ass grinding on my pork sword 




 * Roger Waters

* Sage Francis

* Thom Yorke 




 Most of the Pink Floyd albums would be adequate, but I'm gonna have to recommend Wish You Were Here 




 Which transitions into another phenomenal vocal moment by Roger, when he screams "this dream is driving me insaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane" he screams insane for at least 15 seconds 




 Gunners Dream by Pink Floyd. When Roger Waters screams, "but hold on to the dreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeam!" And how seamlessly it transitions into a saxophone is incredible. 




 Gnarly opening and peaceful track to open up a gnarly album. I think this song is a good preface for TDB 




 This one is all too true 




 Ha, I haven't played him yet, what's it like?
 




 I've been playing a lot of ARAMs lately, and there have been champs that I get the option to level my ultimate with and debate whether it's worth it or not. Mainly champs with ults that allow for backdoor abilities such as TF or Panth. I'm sure there are plenty of others, so that's why I'm asking. What are some champs that you don't level up their ult at level 6? 




 I have fallen in love with this album over the course of this semester, I think this album is perfect for whenever I study or do homework. The only track that I'm not crazy about is Take It Back, and thats because I don't like the chorus that much. 




 Those are the two highlights for me as well, and then Fearless is the next best song IMO 




 I'm still delving into their live material, I'm eager to listen to Pulse, I've heard how good it was 




 Lost For Words 4:00-5:00. Not the best technical solo, but in the context of the song a very clean and appropriate solo, I love it.

Also /u/MaxCHEATER64 would you be interested in doing a similar thing for good vocal performances e.g. Great Gig In the Sky, Gunner's Dream 




 Come on over to /r/pinkfloyd bud, it's a really great band subreddit I found it out to be 




 One of the best songs in the PF catalog for me
