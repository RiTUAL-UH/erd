 Love for the rest of him too!  That stubble...ooooh. 




 Maybe he feels FAB-uloussssssss!!!!!!  My horse is kind of metro -- he can totally rock a pink saddle pad, and he likes having his hair done. 




 Alright, some ideas (some of which are already names of other horses that exist in other breeds, but it shouldn't matter).  Though I do like Legolas!

Stand and Deliver,
Gestalt (yes, I'm a design nerd),
Instant Karma,
Out of Bounds,
Night Out,
No Inhibitions,
Bada Bing,
Outspoken,
Fight Song,
Own the Night,
Chill Factor,
Floored,
Unapologetic,
Once Again,
By Invitation Only,
Alliteration,
To the Nines,
Enthusiastic,
Slow Burn,
Art in Motion,
Shoot the Moon,
Thrill a Minute,
High Definition,
Bold Moves,
Artful Move.

As you can see, I have SO many ideas.  If you want me to run with a theme, word, idea, etc, let me know!
 




 OHHHHHH He's a Saddlebred!  No wonder I love him so much, I've been riding Saddlebreds for years.  Now that I look at him again, I can see it in his face.  Well, I'll think of some names!

And yes, it does look like he would have flunked out of "Saddlebred School" due to his movement, but what so many people don't realize is that Saddlebreds make great dressage, endurance, eventing, jumping, trail, EVERYTHING horses.  They may be the peacocks of the show ring, but they should be recognized as the peacocks of MANY show rings!  And he certainly won't have trouble flexing and putting his head in a nice spot for dressage.  I'm glad he found a home with you, he's going to have so much fun learning dressage! 




 What are the names of his sire/dam?  Sometimes that's a good way to name.  And what breed?  What do you intend to do with him?  Dressage?  This information must be known to achieve a truly kickass name. :)

Also, HE IS GORGEOUS!!!  He is soooooo floaty and beautiful!   




 I knew I loved tapirs, but now I know why. 









 YES.  Just...yesssssssssssssssssss.
 




 Thanks for the well wishes.  She's actually doing really well, and I rode her a bit today!   




 You are both my heroes. 




 YOU get an upvote because you love forearms and, according to your username, HORSES!  I also love both these things.  I have two horses, I also have two forearms.  This cannot be coincidental. 




 We use Markell Insurance for both our horses.  Check it out at http://www.markelinsurance.com/Products/Farm/Pages/PrivateHorseOwnerLiability.aspx

I couldn't tell you off the top of my head what we pay for the insurance, but I know it varies depending on how much coverage you need, i.e. what your horse is "worth".  That depends on show record, age, etc.   They have good medical coverage, but now my mare has issues being covered on ANY equine insurance because of laminitis issues.  




 Great picture!  I'm there right now.  Last day in Venice today after living here for 6 weeks.  Sad day. :( 









 You are very, very unalone!  I crush on him all the time when I watch The IT Crowd. 









 I agree, Toalmaster is far more lady-bonerific than Channing Tatum. 




 You, rulefollower, are not only apparently an upstanding citizen, but also a very attractive man!  This should make it over to r/ladyboners. 




 I show Morgans, so I switch between huntseat (flat) and saddleseat, but I also do quite a bit of driving!   




 Oh my, yes.  There are so many things right with this picture. 




 No, you don't get to go in there, you're just outside the pens.  However, this is still close enough that I have been licked by a wolf and bit in the butt by and ostrich.  




 I would kill to see what you will do with mine.  I hope you find it in all these comments.   




 Check out http://www.volunteermatch.org/. You can search by your location and interests.  It's a pretty great site, and I've found some good things through their search.  Also, volunteering at Como Park is pretty fun -- I was on the grounds crew for a while, and planted and weeded by all the animal exhibits.  The giraffes totally loved me. :) 














 It's not in Hyde Park, but when I was in London I went riding at Wimbledon Village Stables.  My mom and I both rode and had a great experience.  They are proximate to a huge and beautiful park, with lots of wooded paths for hacking.  We got to canter through the forest on some nicely trained horses.  Also, it wasn't anywhere near $150.  We had a guide, and it was just the three of us (the guide, my mom, and I).  So we rode very much for our experience level.  Check them out!  If you can't find anything for Hyde Park, try them instead.  They are a short (20 min) train ride from London.  http://www.wvstables.com/ 




 I remember always feeling bad for the kids with Rose Art crayons.  I was a very aware kindergartner.   




 I have Ariat Terrians http://www.ariat.com/English/Women/Footwear/EnduranceBoots/Terrain.html?color=SUNSHINE  They are incredibly comfortable, and have had the pair I'm currently using for 6+ years.  I wear them outside of the barn quite a bit too. :)  They are casual looking, so I suppose that has to be ok for you and your needs, but myself and my trainers all have these boots and love them. 




 Nice to know there's more than one of us on Reddit. :D  Though I'm primarily a Morgan rider, but dabble in Saddlebreds and Hackneys. 




 Awww yeah, and I don't even like cats!  Change that cat to a puppy and I'll need to change my undies. 




 I also demand more photos!  What a gorgeous horse! 




 Oh same.  We should have a St. Olaf subreddit for funsies.  Though I doubt it would be very active. 




 This scene was filmed at my college.  I had class in that lecture hall! 




 I see your pony and I raise you me (5'3") on a SMALLER pony!

 I would snuggle the crap out of him.  And then make out with him copiously.  :) 




 I ride west of Schamburg in Marengo at Merriehill Farm.  It's about 45 minutes from you, and SO worth it!  They breed and train wonderful Morgan horses!  They do all seats there, and have a beautiful facility.  Lessons are $30, and I think you can do a package deal.  Also, they are wonderful people, and the trainer, Jess is the best!  They have an excellent string of lesson horses for all abilities. Give them a call!  http://merriehillfarm.com/ (watch the video!) 




 I want one.  Preferably in that tree. 




 I want a dapple grey Morgan park horse.  Of course, since there are under 500 registered grey Morgans, and most of those come from more western bloodlines, this may be impossible.  But hey, a girl can dream!  So...like this, but grey... :)  http://morganhorseauction.com/images//2009/CenterpieceREF.jpg 




 I want to snuggle him!!! 




 There is a movie with Robert Urich from the 90's called A Horse for Danny.  You can buy it crazy cheap on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Danny-Leelee-Sobieski/dp/B000A1IL8M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1330539605 sr=8-1  It is my favorite horse movie!  As a child, I was obsessed -- I think I wore out the copy they had at the video store, and my mom finally got me my own VHS of it. 

As far as books, Walter Farley's "Man O' War" is great, even as I grow older, and there is a biography of Cigar called "Cigar: America's Horse" that is very well done.   




 I don't, but I'd love to try!  Also, yay for ASBs!
 




 She is darling! 




 Have you videoed her yet?  I've found that when I see a horse for sale, even if there is a picture of them in motion, I have to see a video to really see how the horse moves.  So I would say a) a video of her doing her thing (jumping, trotting, etc) and then a video.  If it costs too much to list with a video on Dreamhorse, put the video on YouTube and link to it in her listing.   




 Want.  To.  Exist... 




 What a fabulous horse!  What is he? 




 Arab was my second guess!  That or Morab.  The stubborn ones are always lovable. :)  Do you still ride Arabs? 




 Are you riding a Morgan? Looks Morgan-y to me.  SUPER CUTE!!!! 




 Her sister in law has mad skills! 









 Awesome man!  As someone who has had 15 teeth pulled out of their mouth to make things right, I know how awesome your victory feels! 




 Eeeeee!  I give him an 11 out of 10! 




 See, when I was a kid I thought he was a chicken nugget with a face and a tie, I didn't know he was supposed to be a wrinkly old guy.  When I found out he was a real person it blew my mind. 




 She is cute, but also beeeeeyooootiful!  Welsh pony? 




 You could certainly drive in your arena, and learning to drive is part of the fun.  I'm sure someone could show you the ropes! 




 Hot man, cute dog!  And I love your bedsheets!  They are so pretty. 




 If you can't ride, could you drive?  I'm not sure if either of your horses know how to drive, and I wouldn't suggest trying to train them to do it yourself, but if a knowledgeable person can start them in harness locally, I'd bet they'd take to it quickly.  Driving can really help with your riding too, since you have to communicate through your hands and voice, and it gives you a great "feel" for a horse's mouth.
