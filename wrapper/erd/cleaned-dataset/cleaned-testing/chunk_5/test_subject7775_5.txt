 I am quite new to Unity and I am creating a test 3d game. I am trying to use a texture I created but I realised Texture-Tiling is global. So I started importing the texture multiple times to change the amount of tiling. Is there a better way to do this?  




 I have a question, is this on an Australian server? 




 Can you give us more detail? 




 I almost killed myself while reading this. 









 *Complains about someone killing him when he drew his weapon first* 




 No, gas is for my V3S Submarine. 




 Give the recorder to someone else. So that person will hold on to it, and it won't come back. 




 They don't have a publisher, that's why they go to Kickstarter asking for money. 




 I guess, I mean if someone like EA were making this, I would believe it would come out. 




 Why's that? 




 *Too bad when the game comes out December 2016* 




 Any help would be appreciated. 




 That's the point of this picture, It's a TV Channel you can watch from all around of Australia I believe. it just displays a Windows Vista desktop. Too me it seems really creepy, mainly because of the static. 




 I am really confused about that comment too. Care to explain soggywaffles? Also yeah RecentIdiocy he is talking about Far Cry 4 at the beginning of the game you wait 10-15 minutes and the main antagonist comes back and finishes the game.  




 TV = "Television" 




 Any examples on when this happened? Just curios. 




 No one realised how weird that clothing combination is? A Ghillie Headwrap combined with a pink school girl dress. *Sexy* 




 Did it make you cry too? 




 Pretty sure that was The Purge.
