 As long as its just stating HP, I feel fine with it, It's not like you're saying its a rare model or adding cobra badges to it. 




 I can only dream of seeing one in person. 




 We can all take turns owning it, I get it all of May though. ;P 









 Yeah you do. My friend posted on Facebook from BT 









 Not really.. 
The Bullitt Mustang was offered in only three colors: Dark Highland Green, Black, and True Blue.

According to Wiki. 




 You mean if I actually went outside today I could have seen these? 




 He said no financing on the Fiero since its old. And since me and my friend look like we're 12 he must have thought they just want a joy ride, which if we wanted a joy ride we'd go look at Roush's or GT's, not a 135hp Fiero... :P 




 Do you have 11 grand? ;P

The guy wouldn't even let me and my friend ride in any of the cars unless we had the cash right then. Silly. 




 Welcome to how things are ran. 




 Well, she didn't pass it. So.. 




 Arizona won't let that happen. She's not THAT stupid..  




 Hopefully I can get one sooner rather than later! 




 Jeez, how long have you had it and how old are you now? If you don't mind me asking, I'm just trying to figure out how long it took you to get your dream car :P 




 How much did it cost for you? Jeez, I'd do anything just to SIT in one, let alone own one! 




 You literally have my dream car, a Torch Red 10th Anniversary Cobra.

Gah! Do you have any numbers? I'm so jealous of you right now.
Has it been modified, and if so what ways? 




 I got an email a few days ago saying I signed up for it. The thing is, I've never touched anything to do with BitCoins, and I went to look at what it meant and it had my name, first, middle, and last. It also had my birthday almost to the exact everything, but was off by 1 day. They also had my email. So I went in and changed everything, thankfully they didn't have any proof of ID, so it wasn't a full active account. 




 We can hope it will get struck down, no one here likes it. 




 ooooh something without support fell and it happened to be under your car. WTF man! Wow! 




 yes! 




 America

 Yes, 4chan can downvote and upvote. 




 We're human. We judge and make fun of others, it's what we do. Edit: Dem down votes. 




 Dear god, I love those. 




 Fiber is coming to my state, but is just out of my reach. It's in Phoenix and I'm in Chandler.

I'm so mad. 




 If you have anymore picture feel free to post them at [r/NewEdgeMustang](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewEdgeMustang), It'd be awesome to see more New Edges :) 




 Shes giving more exposure to the world what is happening. Hopefully that bring more people in to help. 




 Wait so they beat the snipers to death? 




 I'll try and get some people, plug in this sub in some Mustang posts if they feature a new edge.

Happy to be here moderating! 




 Torch Red, it's so bright and an awesome attention grabber. 




 We're sorry o' great one. 




 I'd be interested. 




 Stuff like this makes me think if anyone has ever uploaded my early high school pictures.  




 So, you made it look like a Cobra.... 




 Pizza. 




 Tumblr. 




 You mean, someone would lie? 














 Once one opinion in the comments gets some upvotes, it becomes the popular opinion of the entire comment section, and everyone scrambles to make a comment agreeing with the top comment to get that juicy Karma. 




 ITT: Suddenly reddit cares about feelings. 




 Me either man.. me either.. 




 Anytime. :) 




 Looks beautiful. God damn. 




 Its 3 commercials per show. Its not bad. 




 I've learned that every comment on gonewild posts, are just really cringe worthy. 




 Woah dude, nature, WTF man? 




 Yeah, for what I'm getting it at, and how many miles it has, it's definitely going to need a swap. But I'm just hoping it can last a little bit so I can use it to get to work/school, before it dies on me. 




 Yeah, definitely cool. No doubt about it. Not a whole lot of power either, but definitely something different. 




 I know! And Its not like you see them everywhere (at least in my area), and I just got a video of it and WOW does it sound really nice on top on looking good.
I wonder why they're so cheap. 




 You are right on that cheap part, hahaha. I think it looks pretty good stock, I don't know why people try to make things look like how they're not.  




 The one I'm thinking about buying is normal, I mean it has 2 stripes but other than that it's pretty normal.
Does anyone know why the Fiero has a ton of body kits for it, it seems? 




 Civ 3, or 4, or 5, or Pirates! :P

Q. How do you make an egg-roll?
A. You push it! 




 456 - I'm finally going to get a car.
:) Thanks 




 Thanks man for the giveaway, good luck everyone! 




 They're beautiful in person, pictures can't capture it all. Nice spot! 




 We.. We all aren't.. I have some MLP things too.. 




 Yeah it's something like 50% to get past legality. 




 Yeah. But you get a whole new car basically and a warranty. Still, it's a lot for what it is. 




 Oh he's there already, half shaved head, piecing, all that fun stuff! 




 It was actually just yesterday! They had a open house, free food, drinks, rally fighter rides, Boy Scouts were there, it was quite a lot of fun.
Yeah they added that extension but now it's just inside the building, I got a picture of it! 




 He just uploaded a picture of the book, "The Satanic Rituals" 




 Yeah... well, North Korea reached the Sun, so we're behind. 




 That's probably my favorite front end of any car. 




 [Heres the side view + a kind inside view](http://imgur.com/a/VVtbk)

I don't know how to get a video off of Facebook. Will try though! 




 Its supposed to be about one of the members ex girlfriend, or so I heard. 




 I only have a side view and a video of my ride in one. Its so comfy even when you're in the air. 




 Gotcha. 




 Ah, gotcha, there is a whole Satanic bible talk that's hidden since it got a lot of down votes. Totally skimmed it. My bad. 




 I'm pretty sure he responded to the wrong comment. :P 




 Yeah... 




 No idea, there was a different military truck as well. 




 [A song by them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB6mhKQxdHc),
And I don't know how to post a picture/If its allowed since it shows them and him.
But there is a bigger band with the same name as them, and I don't understand why they kept the same name. 









 Oh you should see the "band" he's in.. 









 I'm glad that you are feeling different and make a change and helping others. Hopefully others will see this and want to change too. :) 




 License plate is BRB666 




 What game was it? :o 




 wow nature. WTF? 




 It was amazing to go in when no one was there. 




 I've never used a online currency like bitcoin or anything, but dogecoin sounds pretty cool, and you're giving out free coins, so sure I'll try. 




 Thank you! 




 I don't think we are allowed to assist you in your suicide, but we do want you to know that we are here for you whenever you need someone to talk to.

Think twice, please.. 




 Is there any ETA on this? I cannot wait to play!
Thanks! 




 I love that color on any Mustang but definitely on a Cobra. My god. 




 share some love at [/r/NewedgeMustang/](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewedgeMustang/) 




 You're friends dumb (reference to 4th edit), she probably won't stop using now. 




 waiting. ;D 




 I like it, I just dislike how much empty space is in the rear, See? Different likes. :P 




 Lol, it's cool. We all have different likes. I'll take my down votes with pride. 




 Went to Barrett Jackson on Friday and saw the '15's in person, and its an OK looking car from the side, I dislike to front though. 




 What. 




 Lol, because being rude helps. 




 I feel bad for him, god damn man.

2 really mad songs, but one really mellow and peaceful song. Calms me down. 




 no problem!

edit: found the comment I was talking about

"After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage."                                                                          
[item it was found on](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html) 




 try buying new ones and putting clear coat? I think thats what I saw on an americanmuscle customer review. 




 I'd agree with Mcflyguy, stock or dark smoked headlights are the way to go. But really, it's whatever floats your boat. Looks clean though! 




 Ah okay, thanks man. 




 Probably my favorite front of any style besides the 60's. 




 didnt work still, and lost the link. oh well. 




 ohmygosh, you have natural selection 2 :o
I'd be cool if you gifted it to me, but if not thats fine too. :)
Thanks for the give away, I'm sure you'll bring smiles! 
Steam name: test_subject7776
sorry I was like 13 when I made the name. 




 but it says GT on the side. 




 [here](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html), 
Thats if you just want to replace it completely, which might be the best option.

Also a comment that might be important to you (found in the comments on the item): After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage.

P.S. : Nice GT man. 




 That's fucking clean.
