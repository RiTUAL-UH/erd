 Some of it is semantics - the law differs from country to country. In the US if you had like some kind of hippie love nest (no offense intended) it would be easier to organize it under corporate law than civil union law. In fact there are communes in California that are so incorporated. 




 A partnership is a contract, usually between two people - it can be a few more - about how to operate a business (or, in this hypothetical case, a household.) More people involve forming a corporation, where stock is issued and there are more set rules, a board of directors, etc. 




 They took a lot of the outer stone casing of the pyramids - they might have pilfered some of the larger building stones here and there, but not very many. At the time the pyramids were built a canal ran to the site at Giza and the course of the Nile was a good deal closer to the site than in the middle ages, making stone transport a good deal easier. 




 Yes, but your relationship with more than one other person is fundamentally corporate, not a partnership (I'm speaking in technical legal terms, not emotional ones.) 




 True... I might fall into that category at times. I consider Lacan a great philosopher but by no means perfect and he sometimes descended to charlatanism - a trait he shared with Freud... 




 I tried looking online, couldn't find them either. I saw them on a TV documentary on the pyramids a while back - BBC probably, but I can't remember the exact name. You might want to try to contact someone who's an expert on that time period in Egyptian history, probably a professor in Middle Eastern History, or, since they were European engravings, European cultural or art history. 




 In the engraving I saw (on TV admittedly), it looked like the sand came halfway up the side of the pyramid.  




 It does, but polyamory could be covered under corporate law (strange as that sounds!) 




 The "stolen lunch money" theory of Roman expansion is sadly under-appreciated.  




 Yes, that is how it's argued but the other purpose is there as well, people just don't like to talk about it. 




 I don't really see the connection. Quasars are phenomena of the early universe. The Quasar Period was long before any sort of life - at least life as we know it - could have evolved. There are no Quasar-like objects in nearby spacetime. 




 Since forever. The adjudicated mentally retarded and some other classes of adjudicated mentally ill are considered legal minors and are not allowed to wed. You may agree or disagree with this but it is the law most places. These are state and not federal laws though. 




 I support Universal Civil Unions and getting government out of the marriage business altogether. Every adult should be able to designate one other person as their legal "civil partner," which might be their marriage partner, or a sibling, or a best friend.

This makes any sort of gay vs. incest debate irrelevant and lets the State get back to more important business (hopefully.) 




 There are engravings from the Renaissance that show the Great Pyramid about half-buried in a sand-drift. No, nothing in orthodox Christianity or Islam says that biblical figures built the pyramids, but in demotic folk religion this belief was common. You will hear it from taxi drivers in Egypt to this day. 

As for wanting to make a bigger structure, as I said, it was thought that the pyramids were the work of legendary figures so I doubt anyone thought it was possible. The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt did brag that the Great Lighthouse was a successor to the pyramids. At 450 feet tall it was almost as tall as the Great Pyramid though of course its volume was far less. 




 True. It did sound like she sent her daughter to a "progressive" school, not a traditional upper-crust or religious private school. 

There used to be progressive public schools as well in some areas, but the standardized testing era put an end to most of them. 




 I know that for some of the time period in question a good deal of the pyramids were obscured in sand drifts. 

However, it's wrong to suggest that people in previous times were not impressed by the pyramids. There were a good deal of legends about them, such as that they were built by biblical figures (usually Aaron, Moses or Mohammed), and that they could cure ailments. 

As the pyramids were seen as the creations of legendary figures, not ordinary men, their vast size was somewhat taken for granted. In that sense people in those times might have been less impressed than modern people as to the immensity of the achievement. 




 As someone who teaches in one of those "disasters" I can tell you the admin is even more scared of lawsuits because they have no money. As soon as a lawyer shows up we roll over and give the parents whatever they want, no matter how ridiculous.

And in most of the country, the church school is the only private school option. Seeing as we both seem to have the same opinion of church schools, you may want to consider where all those kids will go if you succeed in demolishing the "government" schools. 




 Keep in mind not all Lacanians are Zizek fans. 




 You will find a lot of private schools with endowments that don't really care what parents think - they will always have a line out the door for the snoot factor.

Then there's church-funded schools which also have powerful constituencies that are often indifferent to parent needs. 

In my experience public schools are often over-sensitive to parent demands because of a fear of lawsuits or a nasty story on the local news. 




 She thinks the bullying and political correctness will be less in a private school? Maybe so, but I doubt it. 




 The golden number is aesthetically pleasing to humans, so it makes sense that a building would be designed that way even if the mathematics behind it wasn't known. I don't know about the meter stuff but they definitely degenerated into "History" Channel tabloid nonsense at the end so I wouldn't give it much credibility. 









 this is not about Aliens, or any mystical lines and such.

Positing an advanced ancient civilization that had modern or even super-modern technology levels is just as much of a stretch. 

I'm not familiar with all the stuff in this movie, but the pi stuff at least was explaining long ago: the Egyptians used circular measuring tools instead of rulers, so pi shows up "naturally" in their structures. 









 There's a house where I used to live that was half-finished by one of those remodeling shows. For some reason the producers cancelled the episode that family was going to be in and they just abandoned the place and left the family homeless. It was all over the local news and papers and there was fundraising for the family. I don't know whatever became of it because I moved around that time. 




 You might want to check out the book Weird NJ you might find it in there. I don't remember an abandoned cult town but there was an abandoned town built for midgets complete with tiny houses. I don't have the book anymore or I would look it up for you.

 No, that's not accurate. The ancient Romans made pasta. 




 Apparently it's realizing how the dual and non-dual aspects of reality arise from each other, but I am no expert on such subtle states! 




 If this is the ultimate realization, I'm not interested. Suffering seems pleasurable compared to the spiritual lobotomy this guy apparently suffered. 

Others say the non-dual experience is important but it is not the final experience. That seems more likely - and more like a goal worth attaining. 




 There was a biology professor who did a study that concluded there simply isn't enough nutrition in the NW forests to support a population of large primates unless they came down to the salmon runs, in which case they certainly would have been clearly documented already.

Can't find a link to the study I think it was on a documentary where I heard this professor speaking. University of Washington maybe? If anyone has more info please post. 




 Awesome response, thanks. Very thorough. 




 I know the feeling. Just beware that when you meditate sometimes small sensations can seem very amplified because your mind is quiet. I am not sure if chakras are "real" or not in a spiritual sense but I have been disappointed by these experiences in the long run - they seem to be leading to something great then it just fades. 

On the other hand some other mediators report quite impressive things that happen after the whole chakra/kundalini experience. I guess what I'm saying is don't get your hopes too high just yet but don't dismiss it either. 




 Nice, but beware of sensations that are just fabrications of the mind. I have these experiences every now and then as well but don't assume they can be used for healing.  




 CIA is testing new mind-control rays... 














 Right, but that was still a bunch of the current plates stuck together. My question was do the plates themselves change over time, not just their positions on the Earth. 




 I know the oceanic plates get subducted and new ones form, but are the continental plates permanent? Can they split apart, merge, or be subducted as well?  




 No, the "shocking" part was apparently that Voltaire was against metaphysics and that Godel believed (in his delusional period) that there was a conspiracy to hide these works of Leibniz. 




 There was interesting stuff in this video, but I feel I have to downvote because:

1.) There was nothing "shocking" in the video whatsoever.

2.) It veered into conspiracy theory nonsense and is apparently part of a huge video series on the "secret history" of the Earth

3.) Ouch, the music! 




 If you can't find it there are services that convert a YouTube page to an mp3 file. 
























 Interesting. But then why can you be killed by drinking salt water? 




 Didn't he ever consider that the road atlas in Episode 1 was arranged alphabetically? That would be a much more common-sense reason for an obscure town starting with "Ab..." to be the first entry. 




 The "absolutist relativism" that is so often attributed to Postmodernists can be easily destroyed as a coherent concept by any halfway with-it college freshman, and already has been many times of course.

However, you'd be hard-pressed to find an actual "Postmodern" philosopher who actually held or holds such an extreme position, it's more of a straw-man position ascribed to these philosophers by their opponents. 

Part of the problem is there was never a coherent philosophical school called "Postmodernism," no Manifesto with bullet points nailing down specific beliefs, or anything like that, because after all, what could be more anti-Postmodern than a Manifesto? 

So therefore it's hard to point to any ideas that are specifically "Postmodern" in nature. It is/was more of a mood of epistemological skepticism and a style of argumentation than a defined set of positions. 

 




 From what i've been told, taxes are unreal in America. What is all that tax money going towards?

 None of the people on trial were in the documentary. In fact the documentary didn't even mention Birmingham. The BBC was baffled not only that the judge banned the doc but banned them from even saying why or who had banned it. That's downright Orwellian. 

Edit: And for people who were saying it was only banned until the trial ended, there have been 10-year-plus trials in the past, and we have a government in the US that invented the infinite, undeclared war in order to bypass the Constitution, I can easily see the UK government inventing never-ending trials in order to do the same.

 The Federalist Papers (Anti-Federalist Writings preferred)

Haha, was this in there to see if anyone was paying attention? Or do you have a serious reason for recommending it? 




 Yikes, I will never call myself "depressed" again after reading that. 




 Google "Hitler's Second Book" 




 Correct, but the conventional wisdom is that he was trying to contact those in the government who had been pro-German before the war and would be most open to a peace treaty. Besides any peace treaty between Britain and Hitler would be a de facto alliance since if Hitler could have purchased goods or obtained loans from the vast British empire, his chances of winning the war would have been greatly enhanced. 




 There are several good sources in the Rudolph Hess wikipedia article under "motives for trip" - and one horrible one, a conspiracy theory book published by "Ancient Aliens" type people who claimed the Hess who flew to Britain was a body double  and the real Hess stayed in Germany (!!).

Of course there is also Hess's own statement (under a pseudonym after landing) that he was a friend of the [Duke of Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton#World_War_II.2C_the_Hess_Affair.2C_and_after), and later on that the purpose of his flight was to negotiate a secret peace treaty. Hitler certainly believed that's what Hess was up to and ordered him shot on sight if he returned to Germany (although he may have changed his mind in the highly unlikely even that he returned with a treaty in hand!) 




 I have noticed this too. However, it is not universal. The fans in my place now go 0 1 2 3 0 (there are two off settings.)  




 Yes, in fact he wanted an alliance with Britain against the US, where he thought the Aryan blood had been too corrupted by Jews, "Negroes," and other inferior types. And also he thought that two "Continental" powers would always be antagonistic, whereas a "Continental" and a "Maritime" power could work together. He saw both Germany and the US as continental but the British Empire as Maritime. All this and more bonkers geopolitics can be found in [Hitler's second book](http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Second-Book-Unpublished-Sequel/dp/1929631618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1342462243 sr=8-1 keywords=hitler%27s+second+book) as well as some passages in the original Mein Kampf.

Some people in Britain, by the way, thought about an alliance with Hitler. It wasn't just a one-sided love affair. How many people in Britain and how much influence they had in the country is a matter of debate, but Rudolf Hess was almost certainly trying to contact these elements when he flew to the UK in 1941. 




 What is the distinction between Ur and Sumeria? 









 Quite right, but you would not expect the kind of correlation that Paulides is claiming. You might expect to find several kids who took their clothes off, and several others who hiked great distances, and several others who couldn't remember what happened to them. What you wouldn't expect to find are clusters where *all* of these things happened to multiple subjects without there being a causative etiology (which is a fancy way of saying, something other than random "patterns" in the data.) 














 Actually, Paulides is a bigfoot investigator, and probably first heard about these cases while interviewing park rangers about bigfoot. He tries hard to keep the areas of his life separate because he doesn't want to be the "crazy bigfoot guy" who also does missing-persons cases, but his Amazon page gives him away.

Still, the pattern of cases is no myth and they can be verified in local newspapers and police reports. They could use an advocate with better credibility than Paulides. He is ex-law enforcement but whether it's fair or not, his involvement with bigfoot will make many people immediately discount his other work which is unfortunate. 




 Right, but that 1/3 was down from nearly 90% before the Civil War. 









 A hundred years ago, a large percentage of women were homemakers.

"homemaking" was a hard job and often included much child care and farmwork. Yes, people still have kids today, but caring for nine or ten as compared to one or two is quite different. Today hardly anyone cares for nine or ten kids without it being an employed position (teacher, child care center worker, etc.) I would not count the housewives of the 19th century as being "unemployed" in the modern sense. 




 Sort of correct. The tractor and mechanical thresher did force millions of farm workers off the land. They moved to the cities though and found industrial work in the factories which were booming, but when the 1930's depression hit they could not just "go back to the farms" like city-dwellers had done in previous downturns. That's when the starvation and homelessness started.

It's interesting to read about the Great Depression in France where smallholdings, gov't policy and social customs limited farm automation. The Depression was less severe in France (though still bad) because many laid-off workers simply went back to the family farm. 




 I assume we're not planning on digging mass graves

Don't assume so quickly. I've been reading Ben Franklin's accounts of his trips to England. He had conversations with the upper class where they openly discussed how to start a big war to get rid of the excess population. Eventually they decided (economically) forced emigration to North America and later (legally) forced emigration to Australia were better options, but they considered mass graves. I'm not so sure things are too different today. 




 It doesn't really matter. If the LLC you created defaults on the mortgage, the lenders still repossess the house. Besides most mortgage lenders use standardized contracts and I doubt they would lend to an LLC.

Someone more experienced in these matters, feel free to correct me though. 




 No, the one guy specifically said it had aired on PBS and that "you could watch it" (presumably online.) The two guys looked kind of weird themselves and I was too chicken to butt in to their conversation! 














 It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" and exempted from laws which would have made her throw it out. (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.

Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? I tried asking r/documentaries. Two people had seen it, one thought he remembered the title as "Mad City Tannenbaum," but I couldn't find any reference to that title online. The other could not remember the title.

Further details: The two people talking knew this woman personally, and she seemed to have some mental problems but also some political influence. 




 That's illegal two different ways (stock manipulation and libel), but as long as you don't broadcast your plans on the Internet, sounds like a good scheme... 




 Good point. However it seems like most of the people on here are into sociology or social psychology, not the interpretation of dreams. I think you would find more experts over there. 




 Probably represents the subconscious or something like that. Try r/psychology instead. 









 You're the Zombie Lenin, get on that job. 




 Why did they keep making payments on their car? It's not like the repo man was going to come knocking on their door.

If you stop making car payments, the lender gives your license plate number to the police. Especially with the increasing numbers of police departments with automatic plate-scanners mounted on their cruisers, you will probably be found.

Edit: Oh, and I forgot, it is also possible that you will be charged with stealing the car. In your car loan it says if you can't make the payments you must immediately surrender the vehicle. Technically, the bank owns the car until you make the last payment. Trust me, stopping car payments is not a good idea. Better to sell the car and get something cheaper if possible. 




 There were really two economies in colonial America, one in the South and in Latin America that was more like the old world with huge landholdings and slavery/serfdom. The other was in the North and was really anomalous in world history at least since the early Roman expansion in that ordinary people could and did become landholders, often large landholders.

You can look at the political map of the US in recent elections to see that this divide is still with us to some extent. 




 was simply the marketplace trying its best to shrink the amount of people competing for work in a post-industrial setting?

more the government than the marketplace, but yes. The other main "method of attack" on this economic dislocation was to create "perceived needs" for goods that people "didn't know they wanted." This is more of a marketplace function.

What happens in 100 years if only 10 percent of the planet needs to be employed to adequately fill the market's labor uses?

Ask your Uncle Karl. Also, there will probably be an effort to bring the population down by discouraging children except among the "chosen." 









 Remember that 16? It's now your tax dollars.

 I ask this because the other day I walked into a restaurant with my girlfriend. The maitre d' station was unmanned and beyond it was just a stairway leading down underground. We knew the place was open because I could hear rock music and people talking plus normal restaurant sounds (plates, glasses, etc.) coming from downstairs. 

But... there was creepy clown stuff everywhere on the walls in the entranceway and leading down the stairwell. I could also see the edge of a jukebox downstairs and this frightened me too for some reason. I am not afraid of clowns in the least and neither is the gf but something told us to get the hell out of there and we did. 

We had to walk blocks and blocks to find another restaurant and now I feel somewhat embarrassed at being such a chicken and running away from a restaurant because of clown stuff on the walls. By the menu outside it looked like they had good food and beer too. 

On the other hand, we might have just barely avoided being chopped to pieces by killer clowns. It got me to thinking, who here has had the strong instinct to leave a place for no specific reason but ignored that instinct? What happened then (good or bad)?   




 Can't find anything by that or any similar name. Do you remember when or where you saw it? 




 This sounds more like the legendary origin of the [Hata Clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hata_clan) as opposed to the Yamato (Imperial line.). They were supposedly descended from the Qin Emperor who did indeed have an obsession with immortality. Unlike today's obession with "purity," many Japanese clans of the early historical periods proudly claimed (or invented) foreign lineage to make themselves seem more prestigious. 




 I've always had a soft spot for the Polynesian theory but I must admit most of the recent evidence is against it.

I still think there's a Polynesian influence on Japanese architecture - perhaps spread by merchants which became a prestige form - and on the pronunciation if not the underlying grammar and root syllables of the language. I can't prove any of this, it's just a semi-educated hunch. I used to think Japanese was most likely an Altaic-Polynesian trade creole but this seems increasingly unlikely, especially with the discovery of proto-Japanese forms in Korea. 




 I think it's pretty well-established that the Imperial line originated with a well-organized and warlike tribe in the Yamato region around 300 AD. Sure, they probably had ancestors on the Korean peninsula 1,500 years before that, but it wasn't like they were a "foreign" dynasty *recently* imported from Korea, a la the Normans in England. 




 Possibly a sonic boom caused by a micro-meteorite? Just a guess. Metallic grinding noise could have been the rock disintegrating by atmospheric friction.

 Derivation of the Poisson Distribution formula and its statistics. I have to re-memorize it every year in case a student asks to see it, which someone does about half the time. 




 Cool, I've never heard of these before. Thanks. 




 IIRC, 90% is the upper limit for Korean ancestry of the modern Japanese, not the lower limit. Estimates range from 60-90%, with the remainder being "Jomon" in origin. 




 Well, if the Japanese are Altaic in some distant respect, the Altaic languages were thought to originate in Siberia, as were the Amerindian languagues. It's quite a stretch though to connect the two, other than through some very basic elements such as Shamanism which is widespread throughout all of E. Asia and the New World. 




 would be a strong indication that a people migrated in from that neighbor.

*Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.

The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin. 




 No, we eat far less. I remember reading that the average farm laborer in Ireland the 19th century consumed up to 10,000 calories per day. This was part of the reason so much of the population was rural: Farmers ate a good deal of the calories they produced, leaving much less of a surplus than today. 




 you can trace the migration of Koreans into Japan from the spread of cultivated chestnut trees and later through the introduction of different rice strains 

A common misconception. The spread of a material culture does not always imply the spread of large numbers of immigrant peoples. The same rice culture spread from China to Korea, and the Chinese and Koreans are genetically distinct.

There is a strong argument to be made that the Japanese and Koreans are closely related, but not based on the sort of evidence you site.  




 This is because the author knows nothing of America below the elite 1%.

quite unlike their saw-handling knife-juggling fire-eating American redneck counterparts, for many of whom a greasy fast-food burger and a beating at the hands of a semi-drunk parent before bed will comprise the best coddling they can hope for. 

the hypocrisy, it burns... 









 Assuming you're serious... I'm sure if you traveled back in time you would find that Spartans had a greater pain tolerance than other Greeks, but that would be a cultural difference, not genetic. Probably the same story with the Japanese. They are certainly culturally and linguistically unique, but genetically they don't form a separate population. 

As for the intestines stuff, I've never head this before, but it sounds dubious. Move to Denver and in a decade you'll have larger lungs. Doesn't make Colorodans a special race of being. 




 True. Americans of recent generations aren't really used to hearing foreign languages spoken so commonly. There's a sort of instinctive paranoid reaction of "oh, I'll bet they're talking about us." Growing up in a rural area I found this attitude a lot. If an immigrant was seen to be making an effort to speak and learn English, he was accepted a lot faster than if he was seen in public speaking his native language. 









 Not to mention he was quite racist even compared to the standards of his own time, which is saying something. "Mediterranean" people (like, Italians) disgusted him and of course he was terrified of "Negroes." A lot of this comes out in his writing where this xenophobia gets sublimated into actual "alien" creatures from other worlds.  




 Presumably, with a better economy relative to other rich nations at that point, the US will be able to attract still more immigrants. 




 Yep. I read an opinion somewhere that really stuck with me: A person is only a true, ideological "racist" if he would rather have a family of hillbillies for a neighbor than, say, Colin Powell. Few people these days would make that trade. 




 Tried that, didn't work. I'm starting to think this woman merely claimed she had a documentary made... on the other hand someone on here remembers seeing it (he thinks). Grr... 




 That's one of the things they were talking about, that it still had electric decorations on it and they were afraid it would catch on fire. I got from the gist of the conversation that the woman in the documentary is more than a little crazy. 














 I'm thinking specifically of four bubbles:

Japan in the late 80's.

The US in the mid-2000's.

Spain in the late 2000's.

(Perhaps) China currently.

 Actually I found downloading the update fixed the glitchiness netflix had been plagued with recently, and it isn't doing any of these things on my wii. Which version wii do you have? 




 I agree. I personally don't believe that AP is "real" as in scientifically real (it would seem so easy to get hard evidence if it was - just put random words on a piece of paper inside a locked room or something), but nevertheless it is "real" in the realm of experience, and I find it fascinating.

Personally I think AP is a kind of lucid dream but one where the dreamworld is a replication of the room where you went to sleep and it is not easy to change which is a different sort of experience from a normal lucid dream. I had one such lucid dream in college where I wandered around my dorm, then "fell" through a wall and ended up on the street outside. Unfortunately, then I woke up so I didn't get to further explore the experience.

 I've always thought that the utilitarian and contractualist ethical schools can be reconciled, at least in part, by adopting the [geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) rather than the better-known [arithmetic mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) as the measure of aggregate utility. 

That way, a single person in total privation (like the girl in the Le Guin story who must be tortured in order to provide Utopia for everyone else) would set the measure back to zero. 









 Or a chip in their ear connected to a guy with a laptop. I think the ease of cheating might eventually destroy chess and make something like Go more popular. 




 I'm thinking it was in a book - maybe "Outliers" or "Talent is Overrated" 




 Correct, that 52% is arrived at by counting all words that appear in a given text exactly once. If a non-standard word like "deletable" appears once, it counts just as much as the word "person" which might appear 30 times.

Edit: I just discovered that the Firefox dictionary at least *does* know the word "deletable." 




 There was a study I read about (can't remember where), which measured the IQs of chess grandmasters, and the mean IQ was actually subnormal to a statistically significant degree. Not terribly so, it was somewhere in the mid 90's, but it put paid to the myth of the chess "genius." 

Apparently these grandmasters had spent so much time focusing on such a narrow skill (often from a very early age), that their wider reasoning skills had never developed properly. 

Could at least partially explain all that Bobby Fisher conspiracy theory madness. Chess doesn't drive one mad directly, it merely makes shabby intellects believe that they are geniuses in fields they know nothing about.

 That's not even close to the worst that could happen.

Yep. Back in the landline era, you could get your "lines crossed" and end up listening to someone else's conversation. My mom heard two guys talking about how they were going to defraud some company of millions of dollars. It was no joke they were later on the news being arrested by the FBI. 




 That's what they always do with the nutty coalition partners in parliamentary governments, make them the tourism minister. 









 Yeah, same here, and in my opinion the "Lab Animal" was even scarier and the "Pandora's Box" was mighty creepy too. That whole book is still seared into my memory. Major childhood trauma!! 









 In theory. I'll guess that doesn't actually happen very often. As school discipline is opaque by law (at least in the US, don't know about Canada for sure), the public can't know how this policy is actually being implemented. This is to push up graduation rates, it happens in the US all the time. In many districts the lowest grade you can get for a mark is a 50 even if you never attend class once. That way, you can still "make up" the grade and get to passing by the end of the year. 
























 Yeah, 2000 calories per day is "starving" you. Maybe if you're an athlete. Not if you're a lazy fatass who sits in a hospital bed all day.

Depending on how fat these people are, 2000/day might be a pretty significant calorie deficit even if they are just sitting in bed. Larger mass bodies do take more calories just to keep everything "ticking over." This can be an advantage to weight loss, actually, the fat works in your favor in the beginning, but if a person feels forced into it I can easily see it setting off a panic response (which is why "fat camps" for kids rarely work...) 




 I've put a coffee cup down on a table, and watched it rotate as if pushed by the handle.

This can happen when you get moisture on the bottom of the cup, I've played around with this phenomenon on glass tabletops a few times.

As for the other stuff, yeah, I'd be interested in that self post! 




 Try active noise-cancelling headphones, they go around your ear. As long as you don't need to sleep on your side, you'll barely feel them. Some are battery-operated too, so no need for a cord. They can be a bit expensive, however.  




 Right, but declaring bankruptcy destroys your credit, so if you have the income, just paying the loan is the better option in the long run, and if you don't have the income, you're never going to get that much credit. 




 If you have the income, why aren't you just paying your loan? Is it worth the opportunity cost of defaulting on credit cards and going bankrupt? I guess maybe some people don't think that far ahead.

 














 But that would be fraud

How would it be fraud? Credit card cash advances are unsecured debt. However, good luck getting a cash advance large enough to pay off a student loan. 




 It is a local thing. Outside of NY, people still say "in line," though I have noticed an insidious rise in the British "queue," mainly written though, not spoken, and mainly in places that want to act snooty. That's how these language changes often start though. 









 I think Y(t)/t converges to 1. My reasoning is:

Given the Law of Large Numbers:

E[Y(t)]~=E[sum(x)]

E[Y(t)]~=n*E(x)

E[Y(t)]~=n*mu

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n*mu/sum(x)

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n * mu/(n * mu)

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=1

 




 Y(t) will grow without bound as t goes to infinity. It doesn't have an asymptote. You will always need more and more instances of x (over the long run) for their sum to surpass higher and higher bounds of t. 

This isn't a very interesting question the way you've worded it which makes me think you might have missed something in the question. Can you go back to your HW and copy out the problem exactly as it is worded? 




 Good reply, thanks.
