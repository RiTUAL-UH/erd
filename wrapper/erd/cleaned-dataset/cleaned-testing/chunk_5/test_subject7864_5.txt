 video games are highly addictive because they are psychologically gratifying--as in, you get immediate rewards and feedback constantly. to state that just because someone of one gender is immune to this mental response is unfortunately misplaced sexism. this means, if properly exposed, any girl can like games. So "hot or not" is on a case-by-case basis, just like it would be with any male gamer, which as it is easy to imagine represent all ends of the aesthetic spectrum.

 My Free Concert NY is amazing 




 do you mind if I ask what job function you had there? I've heard mixed things, but the name + getting a job right out of undergrad in these times isn't easy so I took it 




 thanks! money definitely isn't an issue and I plan to live solo 




 I'm going to be working at Amazon so I'm basically only looking around South Lake and Cap Hill. 




 thanks, you rock. My game plan is basically to fly out 4 - 5 days before I start work and schedule in a bunch of walk throughs for then. Is that an unreasonable time frame in seattle? I have relocation funds from my company + plenty of friends who I could crash with if I end up needing extra time. 




 I saw a gallatino essentially doing the econ CAS major minus the math courses. not hating but what's the point? 




 even though I don't need to move in until mid-July? it's that hard to find good stuff? 




 I know things move quickly in NYC--I've had friends here move to NYC and get an apartment in the same weekend. Is this the same in Seattle, or should I fly out substantially early to pick an apartment? 




 so long but worth the read
