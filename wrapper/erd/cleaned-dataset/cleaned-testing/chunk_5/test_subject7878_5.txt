 Same here. 




 Amen! 









 Did you voice a Conservative view-point in /r/politics?  Nah, you'd have 100+ if that were the case. 




 Android... screw Apple and it's closed system that requires iTunes to do everything. 




 Yes.  The world is a world of generali(z/s)ations.

Side-note: as a generalized, lazy American, I make it a point not to learn how every version of every word is spelled in every language.  Who has time for that? 




 That's my point entirely.  The way one carries themselves speaks wonders.  If you're talking on your phone instead of serving me my food; complaining to a coworker about how much you hate being at work instead of checking out my groceries; etc, you're annoying as hell. 




 Yes.  It does.  Hence the term "generali***Z***ing". 




 My experience based upon most Mexicans that I've encountered. 




 When 90% of the people you meet act that way, the small 10% gets lumped in. Sorry. That's how it works. 




 Precisely.  




 It was a tongue-in-cheek, rhetorical question based upon the fact that most Mexicans show little interest in adapting, and want the U.S. to be more like Mexico. 




 If one dresses, speaks, and acts a certain way, they are labeled as such in my mind.

In my city (Baton Rouge, LA; but New Orleans is worse), GENERALLY SPEAKING, blacks are lazy, low-work-ethic, governmental-freeloaders who do nothing but leech off the system while not contributing.  If they DO get jobs, they're on their damn cellphones or talking to each other rather than assisting the customers.

Want me to treat you like a valid citizen?  Then BECOME one. BBM 




 So you must not like the Mexicans in the U.S. then, eh? 




 /r/politics is a liberal circle-jerk. 




 The REALLY ending, damnit! 




 Obviously, someone who is way too close. 




 Boom Beach, AdVenture Capitalist, and Final Fantasy: Record Keeper. 




 Lump sum. Government's going to take a crap-ton anyway.  Might as well only have one year of screwed-up taxes than fifty. 




 I don't know that I daydream or expand on any of them.

To me, though, the most fleshed-out would have to be the Wheel of Time world. So vast and diverse. 




 I work off of Sherwood Forest, and it was pretty damn scary. 




 11:00?  It was 9:30 here when we got the tornado warning. 




 I work in the Airline/Sherwood Forrest area, and it was pretty freakin' scary for a bit there, and I'm a grown man.  HAHA! 









 Yeah, I watched a few.  The K.I.S.S. one is definitely the best. 




 I have a [Gerber knife](http://www.gerber-tools.com/images/Gerber-Mini-Fast-Draw-22-01525-600x500.jpg) I keep in my back pocket.  I use it a LOT actually. 




 Real men aren't Cub's fans, so no. 




 Damn, that was funny.  Subscribing! 









 Keys and car remotes.  That's it... 'cause I'm a **MAN**, damnit. 




 Proof that performing outdoors is hard.

Timing was off.  When the snares can't even hit at the same time, ya got problems.  Tubas were going for "blat" sound over tonal quality. 




 True.  Every now and then, our music director picks a cheesy one.  But overall, we do decent music, and get complimented on our music.

I, for one, feel like we need to do more Latin music than we do though. 




 She just proclaimed to the world that she's a giant whore.  Your parents must be so proud! 




 That looks fan-made... please tell me that's fan-made. 




 Fun idea, but it'll never happen. 




 Never heard of Fozby.com. but I'm going to assume it's a satirical site. 




 I've sung in the at my church since I converted 13 years ago.  We mostly sing out of the Gather Comprehensive and Spirit   Song books that the congregation has copies of.

We rarely go out-of-book, because all of our priests have cared about participation. We sing to minister, not to perform. They are a congregation, not an audience.

I've been to other churches, and I know exactly what you mean. 




 ...so...Madonna then? 



















 Um--no they shouldn't. 




 I never noticed how poorly-edited that was.

Palpatine reacts before he even moves from the Force-push.  Shouldn't it be a reaction to actual movement--not a reaction THEN movement? 




 All that put into the atmosphere will fuel the "climate change" morons for a few more years.

THIS is the shit that changes the climate, people! 




 Why is a tax-fueled organization promoting any campaign?  




 Mirror: https://youtu.be/vdR7GW-rrTs 




 Says removed for me too now. Weird... 




 This was almost my own reaction to the trailer.

I'm a guy, and I totally "fangirl'd". 




 Wow... must be nice to be him... I'd get pissed it someone did that to my 2008 Ford Focus. 




 That game's been out forever. 




 ...what are we supposed to be so excited about...? 














 This needs to be on the front page.  That was frickin' amazing! 




 Yeah, I gathered as much from her IMDB.  Still don't know who she is. 




 The guy in the white shirt had an expression that was a mixture of, "Way to go, moron," and, "Wow--he was an asshole." 




 Am I the only one who has no clue who this is?  I Google'd her... still no clue who she is.

Doesn't look like much from above. 




 The rare, crimson beached whale! 




 "Uhn--my dick feels like corn..." 




 Post karma and comment karma are vastly different. 




 Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Ahem--but seriously--does this surprise anyone? 




 Every time this video pops up again, I can't get that horrid sound out of my memory.  Stop subjecting people to the sound... THE SOUND!... ***THE SOUND!!!!!*** 




 9.X% 




 Put in some dog meat...  If none is available, substitute cheese.

What kind of cook book would sub a dairy for a protein?! 




 * 23.44%
* 26.38%
* 29.30% 

Are the percentages they should actually print with the numbers they provided.

I never follow those anyway.  I double the tax, and round up/down to the nearest dollar (depending on service). 




 Y'know, I normally am fine with the one-hour thing, but this was never told to me when I went through RCIA thirteen years ago. Interesting. 




 Isn't the Eucharist fast only 30 minutes?  If you don't get there by 11:15 or so, they're all gone.  They used to be tasty Mary Lee donuts, but now they're always "meh" Krispe Kreme.  I pass. 




 I go to noon (last one of the Sunday), and if you don't get there to grab one BEFORE mass starts, they don't have any after.  It's always only after 10:00 mass.

[St. Patrick Catholic Church](http://stpatrickbr.org/) in Baton Rouge, LA. 




 Thanks for this.  Just got another half-gallon of Tin Roof a few days ago.  Into the trash it will go. 




 If they blocked my way to a class I have paid for with my own money--used gas I've paid for with my own money--used my personal time to go to--I'd call the cops.

They can protest, but they aren't allowed to block people.  What a waste of air and energy. 




 Wow... that was pretty bad.  Hopefully, it's just chalked up to live conditions and not the fact that they're just frickin' too old to do this now.  Jeez! 




 ....aaaaaaand he was fired the next day for failing to maintain OSHA safety regulations. 




 By "mashed", you mean "replaced".  I was expecting some form of syncing original audio to new video. 




 I'm overweight, but I'm not morbidly obese.  Ya know what thought?  I walk when I shop.  Lazy ass mofos. 




 Those motorized carts should require a scan of a handicap tag of some sort... stop letting morbidly obese people use them; give them a reason to get off their fat asses. 




 [Can't tell if that is Rosie O'Donnell or not...](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/131/399/fry.PNG?1307468855) 




 "Msnnish water" sounds interesting. 




 With those breasts and that face... that better not be a trap.

You forgot the NSFW tag. 




 [...yep...](http://dariobusch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/georgio-ancient-aliens.jpg) 




 Well, it **WAS** his island... 




 Is it called "cooking your own food"?  Yeah, I've heard of that, but most people haven't. 




 Okay, that was pretty damn funny.  I know that frustration well. 




 Capoeira... the dance style masquerading as a "fight" style. 




 Yep.  I need at LEAST 3-lbs. 




 I was expecting a decent impression.  That was horrible. 




 Nope. 




 Preach, preach, preach, preach... 




 [The godd*mn [flower] is blue!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RJgneEIiMeI/VFPWdlt8mNI/AAAAAAAAAOg/MDKp93km5m4/s1600/gXozVsM.png) 




 Yeah, his **#12-Die Antwoord** made me literally laugh out loud. 




 I know of no on here in Louisiana (where I live) that calls them "mudbugs".  It's just "crawfish".  Only people I know who call it "mudbugs" are Yankees.

  Granted, this doesn't take into account fluctuations in your gut bacterium. 




 "Meh... everyone's already seen my boobs from the leaked photos, so I don't care anymore..." 




 I hate being behind trucks like these.

The worst is being behind the trucks carrying multiple cars to dealerships... ugh... 




 1. Chicken
2. Oriental
3. Shrimp 




 You are awesome!  If my three kids weren't spending all my damn money, I'd give you gold! 




 I cannot find any, and I want to add to my wallpaper rotation. 




 They get blue udders. 




 Because you don't eat the exact same things everyday.  If you kept a food diary, found a day when you had non-smelly flatulence, then ate that food everyday, you'd probably not have smelly flatulence anymore.

Granted, this doesn't take into account fluctuations in your gut bacterium.   




 It is most likely not true violet light. It is most likely a blue light going in a tube covered in a red, phosphorus coating to produce a "violet light". 




 If your dad is 80... you are probably 60+/- years old...

1. Why do you still live with parent(s)?

2. Why do you have to sneak out? 




 Pretty awesome, but that video got boring pretty quickly. I would've like to see more than just riding on a motorcycle.  




 Am I the only one that completely underwhelmed with the teaser of a teaser? 




 Does Apple have a grammar-checker?  If not, you need to invest in one.

Your verb doesn't match up... Products/Is/Devices. 




 It already exists... it's called "[spacetime](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/8-cell-simple.gif)". 




 I'm so excited!  Bwaaaaah! 




 I increased my money by 1000%... I was good. 




 Been to a real casino only once. Had $40. Turned it into $400 at the blackjack table. Stopped while I was ahead. 




 Nope.  No one ever comes to Louisiana (i.e., New Orleans) anymore.  I live in Baton Rouge, and even New Orleans is 45 minutes away. 




 Aw, that's sad. 




 Well I give GLAAD a failing grade on being heterosexual.  There.  Same premise. 




  Tumblrites

Nope.  Never been on Tumblr. 




 [Can't say it enough...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLCyYGuFqiA) 




 Okay, that was brilliant! 




 Probably more tour dates... that will be nowhere NEAR where I live...  :-( 




 Aaaaaaaaallrighty then.
