 Yes, I'd say social anxiety goes with it.  Off the top of my head, a few factors would be:

-  Normal thinking people don't GET IT.  It's virtually impossible to explain it to someone that isn't experiencing it.  Even people who HAVE experienced it eventually stop truly understanding where you are coming from.  Because your brain wants to block out the bad shit most times.

- Being around other people increases your chances of having them say something hurtful, do something hurtful....  And admittedly we depressed people tend to be more sensitive about potential negative comments or thinking things have negative connotations when they really don't.   That's just a screwed up perception seeing all the bad and not much of the good...dwelling on the bad more...saying the good was a "fluke" you can't depend on.

- And then you have the thing that people in general just suck.  They dont want to deal with your shit, but they want you to deal with their shit.  1v1 is much easier than groups, because it's so........shallow in group settings most times....and people dont want any negativity or dissent.
 




 It's an experiment they did on a dog in a cage with an electrified floor, eventually it stopped trying to get away from the electricity/pain because of how they designed it.

So basically what the therapist is saying is that you learn to not to try for things as a defense mechanism until you basically learn to become helpless toward issues that are making you depressed, etc.  

I personally don't believe that's a 100% accurate description of everything people deal with, but it definitely has some aspects that can be true.

Now if it was described more like you learn that everything you hope for turns out bad for you, so you learn to hope but never try for those things because YET ANOTHER failure would mean that you'd have reached as low as you were willing to go and ended your life.......

Because depression IMO is basically the equivalent of having chronic physical pain but for your emotions/soul/brain.  Eventually you learn to deal with it, get it treated, or finally say enough is enough.  People can understand chronic pain, very few people can understand that deep loathing/pain/fear mix that makes up depression.   I find a lot of my thoughts are fear driven, because it isn't natural to want to kill yourself.  So you naturally want to avoid things that may lead to more feelings of suicide, and there's where the fear kicks in.
 




 I wonder the same about any goals or wants I have.  That if I get there if it'll be worth the effort, and if I dont...will the failure push me over the edge to actually killing myself.  Therapist calls it learned helplessness or something very similar.  And I think you need to be there and experience it before you can call it learned anything.
 




 You should try more regular masks, most people don't like the dental devices....and if you brux I believe you can chew it up fairly fast.
 




 To the woman who messaged me and then deleted account, please message me again.  I'd be happy to chat. 




 Second of these I've posted, hoping to get more results this time around.

36 year old guy and I'm lonely.  I am white, brown hair, blue/green eyes, overweight (working on it), and am pretty inexperienced at dealing with women in general.  I'm open-minded, like to hear about new things.....told I have a pleasant voice and that I'm intelligent.  

I am looking for an ongoing conversation with a woman, let's say 20-40, light skinned, nice smile, medium/long hair.  I'm into larger chested women, you being overweight is not an issue, I just like proportionality.  In fact it really bothers me to find out there are so many good looking women who think they are nothing special roaming the planet.  I don't lie when it comes to my opinion on looks, outfits, hair, etc....   Ideally I'd like to get a lot of pictures from you and you'd want my opinion on them, but really not necessary.  The IMPORTANT part of this is that you WANT to talk and contribute to the conversations, or even kick off a days conversations if we've lapsed due to whatever.  And if you are not interested in talking anymore, let me know...as simple as that.

Interests:

Reading, mostly fantasy.  Series include Dresden files, Stormlight Archives, Codex Alera, Mistborn, etc.

TV.  Supernatural, Workaholics, Sleepy Hollow, Tosh, Grimm, lots of others

Movies.  Behind on movies, but I like comedies and action probably the most.

Video Games.  Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands, FPS and other type of games only game on PC.

I have a Computer Science degree, and am currently looking into options for going back for a masters in something to open up some job options...still doing my research.  Was looking at jobs for longevity and growth, something like Healthcare, Financial, or possible network security types...so if you're in any of those in the tech side....would be interested in hearing about your experience with them.  The generic descriptions on the web don't do much for me overall.

I have frequent depression, and some experience with other mental health stuff if you would like to talk about those with someone with a little experience it.  

Just be genuine, hold up your end of the conversation, and open up a little when appropriate and we'll get along fine.  Like I said I really enjoy getting pictures from women, but no pressure there beyond an initial confirmation photo swap possibly.

I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video. And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first, maybe with a picture exchange to at least avoid catfish/troll scenarios.

PM me questions, kik name, etc.  Can go from there.  And if you read this post and it's old, chances are Im still looking.  Guys on here don't get too many replies from these things. 




 Sounds right.  I had an appt to get it treated, but it went away and stayed away but for like a day or two...so ended up cancelling the appt.

I also have sleep apnea, I dont know if it's related to the crystal becoming dislodged.  But the mask straps could have some impact on it being that they tight up on one side or the other often when you roll over. 




 I can't remember the name of it, but there are calcium crystals in your ear that can becoming dislodged and go into a canal in your ear filled with fluid that controls your balance.  So when that crystal disrupts the liquid moving, you get the spins and vertigo really bad.  It's really bad if you move your head, bend over, or lay down.

It will come and go as the crystal gets lodged and dislodged in various places.  There are some head postures and movements they teach you to basically try to stick the crystal at one of the ends of the tube.
 




 Lovely. 




 I watch porn, have social anxiety and other issues.

Porn might give you unreasonable expectations toward relationships or the opposite sex and AMPLIFY your social anxiety.  But no, I dont think giving up porn, fapping, or whatever else is going to give you what you lack.  It might make you be less sexually....I want to say aware, but I dont think it's the right word.  Basically make you less likely to value sex/whatever you find sexual over other qualities in the opposite sex that are important to you as well but are .......diminished by the sex drive portion.  That I would say I agree with.

I just know that watching or not watching porn is not going to affect my confidence, comfort around others, feelings of inadequacy and general worthlessness.  

Waaaay too many factors to take into account, and just trying to think of all that stuff adds to the depression and anxiety for me. 




 I'd just like to suggest that you may want to wear clothes with wider waist bands, or where them higher than you normally would.  I think your hips proportions are being distorted due to how your clothing as changed the way your fat deposited around the waist band.  To give your normal wear location a chance to smooth out and be more natural looking.  This coming from a big fat guy working on his weight and noticing how my clothing has "shaped" the fat deposits to be irregular looking when not clothed. 




 Well it amazes me to see pretty people with body issues.  I realize it happens, but what caused it...lack of compliments, taunting, etc?  I know it caused a lot of issues for me, the teasing and what not earlier in life.

Hopefully it gives you depth and empathy for someone who might have body issues themselves. 

It's nice to get compliments from pretty girls.
 




 You should not feel bad about anything you have going on.  Obviously you're not going to be everyone's type, but you are attractive, nice smile, hair, body shape, etc.

 




 While the post is 5 days old, and ancient by internet standards.  If women come across it still, feel free to contact me.  Might post another one this weekend. 




 The place Im looking at for surgery doesn't recommend lap bands anymore.  They also don't recommend or do duodenal switches as far as I have heard.

I THINK, it's because the results aren't as good.  But also because it's a foreign object in your body and if you dislodge it or have complications they have to operate to remove it and usually dont put another one in due to trauma or whatever caused by the one that came loose.

I know of at least one person who had the lap band and had major complications with it, resulting in them having a herniated stomach, where the stomach moves up into the ribcage area.  And then because of that, the bile of the stomach would collect in their esophagus when they slept....


They are getting a gastric sleeve as a replacement for the removal of the lap band to go along with the surgery to fix the herniation.


Im looking at getting the gastric sleeve, I am......150-200 pounds over my "goal weight" depending on where I want to end up.

Your weight loss should be based on your BMI as well, a short person 70 pounds over weight is worse off than a very tall person 100 pounds overweight.  The tall (man presumably) is going to lose the weight faster just due to their size and will take less a calorie cut to see results.  Where a short woman will have to cut pretty significantly to see results most likely.

Also my surgery choice also does not recommend exercise at first if you are higher on the BMI scale because of possible injuries.  I think it also helps you to better determine a diet you will lose weight on no matter what.  Then add in exercise when you feel your energy levels and ability to more easily carry the rest of the weight increase.  

A number of people post surgery talk about their energy levels being crazy high, I guess due to the hormone changes and more protein intense diet.  But I've lost about 30-40 on my own so far and havent felt any major changes in energy levels, in fact I think the weight loss might be causing my depression to become worse due to the stored fat being burned containing hormones and them being released.  Plus you don't get those little "food highs" if you cut out your trigger foods.


For surgery, IF you struggle to lose and keep weight off, get the surgery. It'll depend on your BMI, but if you keep going back and forth, eventually you're going to get tired of it and say screw it.  Plus wouldn't you like to be skinnier and healthier, earlier rather than later?  I wish I had the option 10 years ago, and so does everyone else I've talked to.  They wish they could have did it much earlier in life and the majority of them say "I was fat for as long as I can remember."  Or at least since their teens, it's no way to live if you're unhappy with it and it only gets worse as you age and your body starts to have medical issues due to it.

 




 Disagree, dig the leash. 




 I prefer lighter skinned women,  medium to long hair, nice smiles....medium to large boobs a plus.

I want your thoughts, pictures, videos made specifically for me.  I can give you prompts, talk you through it on voice chat or just stick to text.  Nudes, outfit decisions, whatever.  Simple as that, if you want more from me we can discuss it but I pretty much just want to tell you what to do and have you do it.

Snapchat, kik, skype...   




 Man I love seeing chicks in collars. 




 When you think killing yourself will "teach them". 




 Funny you mention that therapist thing, I usually go through a bad spell after seeing the therapist then getting better as it gets closer to seeing them again.

I thought it was me pushing stuff down so I don't seem to "off" or strange to people.  Because I know they pick up on that.......anger underneath.  Depression is just anger turned inward.

I DO NOT have it all though heh, Im not totally screwed but yeah...definitely closer to the bottom of the pit than crawling out of it.

I feel like I've had some kind of depression for about 20 years.  And I believe Im a bit more emotional/sensitive than "normal" guys, I see them blow shit off like it's nothing all the time..like rejection means nothing, etc.  And it just eats at me, causes me sleeplessness, etc.

But you definitely want to stay off the booze if you want to figure out the depression portion some, it amplifies depression.
 




 So, I've sent a lot of PMs to women on here asking for friends, whatever.  Havent gotten any responses, and Im sure they've had a lot of applicants.  So will try putting up a post of my own to see what shakes out.

36 year old guy.  Depression, extreme loneliness.  

Haven't had any "in person" female relationships in .....20 years or so.  So it's a confidence issue at this point.  I know I want one, but I'm an oddball apparently.

Read...mostly fantasy.  Dresden Files, Stormlight Archives, etc.
TV...Supernatural, Workaholics, Tosh.0, many others.
Movies...I'm behind on them.
Video games...Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands and others...all PC.


Computer Science degree, but really haven't found that job that seems ideal.  Might be a case of location, might be something else really dont know.

All my friends are moving on to wives and children, and I'm left trying to figure out what to do with my time.

Overweight but working on it.

I feel like my life is more up in the air now than it was in college if that speaks to you.

Can discuss whatever, would prefer to stay away from politics and religion.  You being well spoken/written would be a plus.

Im a fan of bigger chested girls, long hair, nice smiles.  More into white girls than others, but I really don't want to limit myself in that regard as you just never know.

All I can do is try at this point I guess.  It's discouraging to say the very least.  PM me with a little about yourself and prove you read this.  I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video.  And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first.
 




 Wish I could find the motivation.  I can't even stand being out in public where people can see me trying to do it.  Thinking about it makes me want to just be fatter so I can die sooner and suffer less overall.
 




 There's a setting on my machine that's on or off.  Basically the machine detects you are exhaling it drops the pressure down until some period has passed or it detects you breathing in again.  You need to figure out what you machine calls this setting and turn it on.  Because I had this issue during the actual sleep test, with asthma and everything it felt like the thing was trying to suffocate me trying to breathe against it.
