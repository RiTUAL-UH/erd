 He could face a civil trial, but the opportunity for a criminal prosecution is past now, isn't it?   




 No, I think that there's a clear conflict of interest to have prosecutors prosecuting their policeman colleagues, whatever the race of the victim and policeman.   In this case, the black officer got off for the same reason that Darren Wilson did.  In both cases, it needs to stop.  We need to eliminate this glaring conflict of interest.

My comment about "McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force" was a retort to captrockwelltorrey, who implied that because McCulloch is a Democrat, that somehow exonerates him of favoring the police officer in the Wilson/Brown case.  I was merely pointing out that while McCulloch might be a Democrat, one could make the (equally non-sequiturial) counter-argument that he's white.  I might have more clearly stated my objection with "WTF does him being a Democrat have to do with anything??"  Anyway, that is what I meant.

That is racism.  The fact that you aren't convinced says more about your disposition than about the facts.
 




 Because there is a news article documenting each racist cop in Ferguson, right? 




 These statistics demonstrate things pretty convincingly, but I'm sure you'll still be unconvinced.

 So your argument here boils down to "Racist white people" and "Conspiracy"?

WTF?

 




 To the contrary, McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force, betrayed his role as prosecutor, which is to present a case which argues for trial.  In fact, [almost *all* grand juries decide to indict, except when the defendant is a police officer](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ ).  That's not some strange statistical coincidence - it's the expected, obvious outcome when cops are prosecuted by their direct colleagues.   





























 This is true for almost every article on the NYTimes.  Once you reach the limit of articles for the month, you can't read more unless you put your browser in "private" mode.   


Everyone left Slashdot  precisely because of over-zealous moderation, and it's ruining the experience here too. 




 So r/politics has gotten to the point of blocking the NYTimes now too? 




  doesn't that indicate to you - as an attorney - that the evidence that the officer did anything culpably wrong was essentially non-existent?

No.  When the defendant is an officer of the law, grand juries frequently *fail* to indict, unlike what happens with everyone else.  So, what happened in this case is  the rule, not the exception.  Regular people go to court, officers get off:
http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ 

The obvious explanation is that the massive conflict of interest in having your colleague frame the case for your grand jury is producing the expected result.  And that's why there's so much furor over this case --- everyone knows that officers aren't accountable to the law.  

 
























 Are Christians more violent than Muslims?  [What do the statistics say?](https://abagond.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/are-christians-more-violent-than-muslims/ ) 









 If I understand correctly, you're proposing to use charitable donations essentially as a form of brand advertising.

The question you should ask is: what are your goals?  Are you trying enhance your brand's reputation?  Or do you need to boost short term sales?  Charity is pretty much guaranteed to perform worse for the second purpose.  As an entrepreneur, you understand that resources are limited, and your route to success depends on getting maximum ROI.  

Are you sure your business is at a point where building brand value is more important than expanding the business or boosting sales?  It all depends on the growth profile of your business, and how much brand value is important, and how much giving to a particular charity can improve that.

If you decide in the affirmative, I'd look at this as a kind of advertising campaign.  Will the charity give your business exposure to the right audience?  Will you get constant exposure, or a one-time promotion?  How many eyeballs will you reach?  Over what time?  What are the demographics of the people who will be exposed to the message about your support?  Will they understand what your company does and why they might be interested in the product?  How will you measure success?  What metric will you use to decide to continue the campaign or not?  How long do you have to run the campaign to see the result?  

Long running brand awareness campaigns, are harder things to measure than more focused forms of advertising.  20% is a healthy chunk of profits - I don't have figures, but I'd hazard a guess that this level of spending on charity is extremely rare.  Why do you think that is?  My guess is that the market is doing ROI calculations - large businesses with excess cash can afford to spend what to them are small amounts to get a large outcome in terms of brand perception.   My guess is that you're running a relatively small business, so you're going to be spending a lot more, and getting less of the charity's promotional efforts.  Probably not a good deal.

Now, there are probably some good counter examples to what I've said - public radio, for instance, but that is a very particular case.  First and foremost, the "charity" is actually a form of media, and has an actual audience, so this kind of spending is very much like a traditional ad buy.  

**TL;DR Don't do it.**

 We do get a lot of angry Arabs and muslims out of it.  Go figure - those people are so irrational!

Sorry, man - looks like you're one of those victims of Republican talking points that Gruber is talking about. 




 TIL; the only valid laws are constitutional amendments. 




 No, he said that "the stupidity of the American voter" required that the law be unclear about what insurance actually is.  ANY solvent insurance plan requires that healthy people pay in more than they take out than sick people.  That is what a fucking insurance plan actually *is*.

But since Republicans turn everything into a political issue, even that simple fact which follows from logic is somehow a scandal.  Yes, to Republicans it's a huge scandal.  The rest of the world calls this "insurance".

So, yes, he was right on the money:  people who are swayed by Republican talking points are in fact stupid.

  The Koch bros are not the running the GOP and have NO influence over the Tea Party. They are free to support any policies they wish but that has no bearing on how the Right votes.

Now I know I'm being trolled.
 




 Part of the standard Obama playbook - make statements placating the base while running a government that does the opposite. 




 Seriously?    The GOP is carrying out the Koch agenda, and their agenda is pretty clear:
http://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers

  * Repeal of federal campaign finance laws - means that politicians serve the wealthy, and resulting in the US becoming [a de facto oligarchy](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy ).
  * Reduction of social services, which reduces the bargaining power of labor.  This results in lower wages and workers rights.  
  * Against laws that police corporations, but none focused on reducing policing of regular people.  The result of this kind of policy is that corporate profits and property get state protection, but the freedom and rights of regular people aren't protected.  


Yet, at the same time that conservatives seek special rights and protection for the owners of property, they want to abridge personal freedoms of regular people:

  * DOMA
  * Reagan's War on Drugs (which right wing Dems shamefully perpetuated)
  * Anti-Abortion regulations
  * Anti-athiest laws
  * Anti-union laws: http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/g-o-p-platform-seeks-to-weaken-powers-of-unions/?_r=0

The list is so long, it's almost  silly to respond.
 




 Yet, those are the results of conservative policy. 




 Don't worry, we all prefer corporations controlling our lives. 




 **Submission Statement**

A NYTimes piece that goes in depth into the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court's decision to take up the challenge to Obamacare.  In fact, everything from the decision of SCOTUS to take up the case when precedent was largely being set by the lower courts to the details of the specific legal issue itself suggest a truly unprecedented action.  Which the author argues is worse, legally speaking, than what happened in Bush v. Gore. 



















 I mean in this sense - economic egalitarianism is a central concept of classical liberal left libertarianism.  That is, obviously, also a central theme of Warren's politics.  Checkout the entry in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Classical_liberal_left-libertarianism.  

 Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka, and David Ellerman root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and appropriation. They hold that it is  for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others, a condition John Locke explicated in Two Treatises of Government. Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long doing so satisfies the proviso that there remains "enough, and as good, left in common for others."

Penned by the Directory of Duke's Islamic Studies department, this article talks about the Muslim way of asking how you are doing:

 Kayf haal-ik? or, in Persian, Haal-e shomaa chetoreh? How is your haal?

 What is this haal that you inquire about? It is the transient state of ones heart. In reality, we ask, How is your heart doing at this very moment, at this breath? When I ask, How are you? that is really what I want to know.   









 Agree with everything you say here.

So can the various sides can agree on desired outcomes?  It may be that this just moves the problem to a different place, but I think, it's a more honest approach.  

You suggested "Human flourishing".  That seems like a good starting point that probably both left and right can agree on.  So how would we quantify it?  What would we accept as evidence that one system or another leads to the desired outcome? 









 She's left libertarian, but in America, Libertarian usually refers to the right-wing version. 




 Rights don't have any basis in physical reality - they are just rules that are made up to support a particular way of life. We don't have a right to land ownership anymore than a beaver has a "right" to dam a river.   So talking about rights is essentially meaningless - or a way of forcing agreement through assertion.  Rather than ask what rights people have - because anyone could assert anything, and they have: a right to healthcare, a right to move freely anywhere, a right to enslave. If we insist on basing a discussion on rights, there's no way to get agreement, unless the participants already agree about the same set of rights. It makes a lot more sense to ask what outcomes we'd like to have, and figure out what rules will support that form of life.

You talk about early voting, but it's Republicans who have consistently tried to reduce early voting.  The reason is obvious - they benefit from making it harder to vote.  It's pretty clear that Republicans can't win the voters, so they need to prevent them from voting.

 Your response is filled with unsupported accusations.  Democrats are playing a silly little game - evidence please.  And you're claiming they want long lines for their voters?

 First two paragraphs.  

 *Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the "Freedom Party" (Tnuat Haherut) a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties.  It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.*

 The current visit of Menachen Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit.  **It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin's political record and perspectives could add their names and support to the movement he represents.**
