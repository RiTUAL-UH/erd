 'Tis the season to be rusty! 




 Mmmmmm, deliquescent. 




 Well, yeah, it's hard to grow a lot of it and you don't get much. However, if I'm guessing you're like me, being efficient isn't the point. The point is doing it yourself and having fun. So...

The Saffron Crocus is sterile (due to polyploidy, it's 3n); no seeds. So you can only get more bulbs from vegetative bulb division. If you get a bulb, it will slowly grow into more bulbs over time. I bought one bulb about 4 years ago and I'm up to 5. Sorry, but I'm not willing to part with any of them yet. Check [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0 _nkw=saffron+bulbs _frs=1) in the spring and fall. They aren't too expensive.

They are mostly grown in a Mediterranean climate and require full sun. They are short-day plants and require a specific amount of dark to flower in the fall. [Check the Bible for more culture specifics.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron#Cultivation) Good luck!

Edit: clarity 




 I'll give you 10 to 1 she's never read the bible. 




 I would pick and toss (trash not compost) any affected leaves before planting. Then just be vigilant.

Transplants tend to be packed tightly into greenhouses for propagation. These can be hot spots for disease propagation, too. As long as your plants are not as closely packed, and you watch for problems developing, you should be OK. 




 It's called Alternaria solani, or the causal agent of Early Blight. The angular bull's-eye shape is a classic feature. Nice photo.

Do a good clean-up in the fall to control it. But if you live somewhere humid, or your plants are very close together, it can defoliate tomatoes and potatoes. Copper fungicides are another control for the home-grower.

Good luck! 




 What are your qualifications? 




 The viruses don't replicate in this case. They are only the viral shell filled with a sequence we wanted. Viral shells (capsids) are really good at injecting nucleic acids into cells. No replication.  




 This is really cool stuff. This technique could be used for all kinds of single gene diseases. Permanent cures for some kinds of deafness, color blindness, and cystic fibrosis, among others.

Another related tool could be fight specific, tenacious diseases. If you can make a worthwhile antibody in the lab that targets a conversed antigen of flu or malaria, then transvect that into a host B-cell after chromosomal rearrangement. 

Why aren't we funding science more!?!! 




 Fun fact, if astrology types actually looked at the sky the whole thing would fall apart. There's a 13th (Ophiuchus) because the stars have moved since the time of the Babylonians.

The planet or sun or whatever isn't even in the claimed constellation a bunch of the time.

I don't expect people to re-evaluate world views to often, but if the stars control everything, look up once in a while! 




 There is a box of donuts in the break room on the 17th floor of Van Hise every Friday morning. Play it like you are suppose to be there, grab a donut, and punch the elevator back down. I've done this a few hangover days.

Be sure to make uncomfortable eye contact with the UW system president (Ray Cross) if you get the opportunity.  




 I took it my senior year as a relax class. Holy crap. So good. Really a dynamic lecturer. He's a science story teller. 




 The Bruce Company is solid.

Avoid municipal mulches as they tend to be made from trees around town that have died. Many are maples dead from Verticillium wilt, a disease caused by a fungus. It can easily survive for a year or two and has a wide host range, i.e. it could kill your plants too. 




 This isn't a joke; it's a legitimate question. This fact has implications for relativity and the fabric of the Universe. 




 I liked [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/29/268422490/episode-513-dear-economist-i-need-a-date) a lot. 




 Thanks! I'm up to two. 




 I have "Free adult man to good home."

But that might only be funny to me. 




 They are usually biennial and if it's that large in April it is likely to flower this year. Iff'in the transplant doesn't set it back. 




 Common Mullein, Verbascum thapsus

Yep, a weed. 




 Since many antibiotics work on bacterial ribosomes (16S), and we have bacterial ribosomes in mitochondria, why don't our cells die along with the bacteria? 









 I'm so going to enter the family gun package giveaway!! 




 Neat!

Gymnosporangium rust. This is the telial stage which makes telialspores, which make basidiospores, which infect apples/quince/hawthorn. There are three species and they all looks really similar. They call it cedar-apple rust because you see it on junipers.
