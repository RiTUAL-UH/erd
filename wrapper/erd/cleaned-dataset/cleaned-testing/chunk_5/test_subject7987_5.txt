 My ex is a shy, sensitive girl who had gone through a rough childhood with an emotionally abusive mother.  We had first met as pen pals in high school, so over the years she had opened up to me with a lot about her past that she had never told anyone else.  We started dating when she moved to the city I was going to school in.  I was studying engineering at a military academy at the time, so with the demands of my school I could only really see her on the weekends.  With the stress of her past, and her living paycheck to paycheck in a rough city, she would break down every once in a while and call me just to try to get through whatever was bringing her down.  One night she called me during the week, and she seemed especially upset.  For some reason I had a light load with my schoolwork that night, so I told her I'd call her right back, took a taxi to the train station and got on a train before I called her.  On my way over she told me just about everything that was on her mind.  It was late in December, but after I got to her apartment I waited outside talking to her until she had vented everything on her mind.  I explained the cars going by by telling her some guys in the next room over were watching a loud movie.  I waited until she told me she felt better before I told her where I was.  She was on the fourth floor, but she ran down all four flights in pajamas to meet me at the door.  We talked in her apartment for about an hour, but, because of my academy's curfew, I had to take a late train back to school that same night.
