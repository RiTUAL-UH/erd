 My 10 is probably about a 7-7.5 for most of you. For others, it would probably be considered higher, and for the rest, it could even be a 3. Pain tolerance is dependent on the person, and I know for me, a 10 is when I can't walk (Early-Onset Arthritis.) My knee is in so much pain, I have to judge just how badly I need to use the restroom before getting out of bed just to walk across the hall. My SO has on more than one occasion had to go to the kitchen for me just to get me some water because I'm at a 6 for me. A 6 cripples me, a 10 just means that I can't move at all, for fear of passing out. 

Unfortunately for me, if I'm having a day when I reach a 10 and still need to go to work, I have to push through due to the fact that my job requires I be on my feet all day. Those are the worst days for me, because no one at my office knows that I have arthritis in my knee.  




 If there's a chance the treatment won't work, I think you should try the surgery. No one likes to be in pain all the time, and I for one would do anything I could to help the recovery process. I'm willing to put down good money that your insurance would cover this kind of surgery. I say go for it, OP!! 




 So that "foreign" language looks and sounds Enochian to me. That would be the language of the Angels for anyone who didn't already know. Those are very dangerous spells, OP. Be careful dealing with those. 




 Yeah, I pressed it. Couldn't stop myself. AMA!! 




 I currently have a Turtleship Brass, but it's getting old, been dropped one too many times, and it's just overall time for a new mod. However, I'm broke as all hell. Can someone suggest a good mod that's fairly inexpensive? I'd like to spend $150 or less if possible. Thanks guys!! 




 I honestly can't read the books or listen to the audiobooks without feeling like this. This universe is just expansive and including that I always feel as though I'm a part of it, and it's so well written that I just get sucked in and have a really difficult time leaving. That being said, NO REGRETS!!!! 




 All demonic entities have a dark side. That's why they are considered demons. That being said, not all are pure evil. In fact, some try to do good, and bad things happen as a result. Some try to help, and things just go awry. Try to focus yourself on what he wants, OP, and remember this. Maybe he's trying to help. Maybe he's trying to rectify his sins of past. 

Always acknowledge him when he wants it. It's when they get angry that the bad shit really goes down. That's when they strike that hardest, and the strongest. 

They are always there watching, waiting for the right moment.  




 Can you ask this "site" why the shadow people only went for those with souls? I feel as though those without souls (such as yourself and myself) would be of more use. We could cause destruction, mayhem, and chaos.  




 I also work at Starbucks, and I must say, being burned by coffee is usually the least of my worries in a day. I usually burn myself a good three or four times a day. My hands and wrists are so used to it, I just don't feel it anymore xD 

ANYWAYS!!!! I digress. Honestly, I feel for you :/ It's really shitty when you burn yourself at work. Did you supervisor at least let you go to the back to take care of it? 




 Simmons. The chick that plays her is fine, and the accent, oh god the accent......
