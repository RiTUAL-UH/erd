 It looks like someone's feet are crossed on a glass table and the sun is reflecting off it... is that possible OP?

 Yes! I've been a fan of Kings of Convenience for a while and just recently heard *Golden Cage* on one of my Pandora stations... Now I can't stop listening to **Dreams** and **Rules**! 




 Oh, I'm sorry, arrogant German-internet stranger... I did not realize you were Hitler's sidekick back in the day! My apologies!

Make shit up? No no no... I just **READ**. Ever tried it?

*Hitler originally wore the Kaiser moustache, as evidenced by photographs of him as a soldier during World War I.[7] There is no agreement as to what year Hitler first adopted the toothbrush.[1] Alexander Moritz Frey, who served with Hitler during World War I, said Hitler wore the toothbrush in the trenches after he was ordered to trim his moustache to facilitate the wearing of a gas mask.[1][8]*

You may need your mommy to help you sound out the words, a lot of them are pretty long.

Edit: FYI, the comment you responded to was referring to the Holocaust, not his mustache...

 Are we talking Celsius or Fahrenheit?  




 But.... Will.... It.... Scale.... ? 




 Lol. It was totally not mainstream at the time... Or anytime after... Or ever... So yeah, definitely a hipster.

 Actually, that is a myth. The average rainfall in Seattle is much lower than most states in the Southeast... They just have that hazy sky most of the late fall/winter.

 As a father of three children, I am becoming increasingly more concerned with the role that money plays in our lives. It is sad that I sit hear and think to myself, *This is not news anymore, it is so commonplace to hear about these things. It would be bigger news hearing about people that are outing the rich fucks that are bribing people*

 I mean, I get that reddit is a community dedicated to original content, but not everyone...

**a) has time to search everything they feel is unique and interesting before posting**

**b) has seen everything unique and interesting posted on reddit for all of time**

**c) has posted something, knowing it is a repost, for the soul purpose of receiving upvotes**

Are reposts really such a detriment to reddit that a person (and I tend to believe "most" redditors are unaware of reposting) should be subjected to such ridicule?

If you are aware of a post being a repost, just don't upvote it, IMO... When a repost receives a lot of upvotes, is it not because the redditors upvoting have never seen it before? And find it unique and interesting?

 If every redditor had to search Google or KarmaDecay all the time to experience past posts or check for reposts, wouldn't reddit become less relevant?

I apologize in advance for my ignorance of this subject. I am a long-time "lurker" and have just recently decided to create a username and begin contributing to the community... So I'm relatively "new-ish".  Also, thanks in advance for anyone who replies!

 LOL... lighten' up. 




 OK... My mama so nasty, she brings crabs to the beach. 




 ...and here we are talking about her, so, like I said, full circle. 




 My apologies to the captain of the "repost police"... not everyone on reddit has seen every post ever posted to every subreddit like you have.  Some things just come full circle, like your mom.
