 Wake Forest has been in the ACC how long? And they're a relative nobody in college sports.  They had some good basketball and that one Orange Bowl year.  But that is it.  

They have the money, but haven't capitalized.   









 That's the thing.  Just from a "markets"   recruiting level, none of the 4 ACC teams would want another NC team.  

And (almost) none of the other 11/12 (however many teams y'all currently have) teams wouldn't want ANOTHER NC team, to concentrate the power there even more. 




  Seriously though, having SMU and Houston would be awesome for some intraTexas rivalries - TCU, Baylor, Houston, SMU

 Because its been going on for over 20 years. That means there have been....

* Five chancellors (The top person)
* Two Athletic Directors (Includes John Swofford, the current ACC Commissioner) 
* Four Head Men's Basketball coaches (Includes Dean Smith)
* Five Head Football coaches (Includes Mack Brown)

That doesn't include all the other minions needed for something this large.

This wasn't isolated.  But it would be difficult to get a cancer this large in any other school.

 Well....The Mets get their color combo from the Dodgers (Blue) and Giants (Orange).  So having orange makes sense.  

Blue is just a common sports color.

I'll refresh my /r/all list now.  It was interesting beforehand.  None of them showed up immediately.  It was a couple of pages in before they would appear.   









 Only one had an "r/" in front of it.  And it wasn't a filtered subreddit that I saw.

I have a filer list that I haven't messed with in a long while.  But today, after redditing on All/Top, I had a Trees then Atheism post pop through (Both on my filter list).  Now many others on my list are showing up.

I've restarted Chome, but the same thing occurs. 

Thanks! 




 The blue from the flag bleeds over to the Coat of Arms.  But I think it does look better than the clip art.  




 I guess mine is magical.

But the reason for the post is to give an option on buying a suit (or nice clothes in general) that might be a little too large.  But save money, because it is on sale.  

You shouldn't go buy something more than 1 or 2 sizes too large.  Anything larger and your tailor might not be able to help.  And the price to tailor might reach the breakpoint price.  And even then, you can take it too the tailor and let them look at it.  If they can't help you, return the clothes.   




 It is a little (lot) more complex, especially at the FBS level. But that is a good birds eye view of things.  




 This might get confusing.

Dayton is in the Football Championship Subdivision.  Division I (your top level) is subdivided into two subdivisions: Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).  

FBS has your more well known teams. 

So Dayton plays at the 2nd highest level of collegiate football.  




 Whenever it looks like I struck gold, it usually ends up being Fools Gold.  




 Arrrgh! 




 Exactly.  I watched like a quarter of the MNF game last night, before I came out of my brainfart and realized it was on WatchESPN.com.   




 The key for a good looking suit, is to get a tailor to do his magic on it.

They can also tailor suits that wouldn't fit otherwise.

Let me give you an example.

I recently bought a Brooks Brothers suit for 70% off.  It ended up being around $90 total.  But it was a couple of sizes too large for me.  So I brought it to my local tailor. $80 later, I had a suit that fits/looks good.  The only reason it was $80, was because it was A LOT bigger than what I needed.  I took another suit that was closer to my size and only spent $50. 

So I paid $90+$80 for a $300 suit.  

This is ESPECIALLY good for the normal sized people out there.  It always seems like the clearance rack is full of plus sized clothes.  

--------

They also have repaired numerous things (backpacks etc), cheaply as well.  

It never hurts to buy something and take it by the Tailor and see what they can do.  At worse, you'll have to return the item.   




 Do people not borrow login info from family/friends for WatchESPN.com?  




 What would it look like if they converted the white background to transparent?  

What about someone *improve* their flag?   














  punishes the P5 schools

I thought G5 is guaranteed a spot. As in that wouldn't punish them.  

Wait....This isn't about getting into the 4-team playoffs.  No G5 team will get that, almost ever.  This is about one of the NYD bowl games. 




 If Marshall wins out, they CAN'T get the New Year's bowl, unless every other possible team stumbles.

Why?

Because if an undefeated Marshall gets in with their SOS, then every team will start to schedule down. 

The committee HAS to set a standard in regards to SOS.

 Isn't your stadium name the TD***ECU*** Stadium? 




 I'm gonna need a TL:DR on that! 




 Which means it is deeper than the coach.  UNC is, was, and will always be a basketball-first school.

 Having to pee becomes a predicament.  



















 Also, the American Athletic Conference isn't listed, and Big East is.  That needs to change.  Along with that CUSA has a lot of new members as well.  




 Are you the owner of this website?  If so, I have a few suggestions. 

* If you choose a certain division, repopulate the conference list with conferences on in that division.

* Have the ability to make each conference a different color, so people can compare schools/conferences.

* Have the ability to choose multiple divisions/conferences to display at once.
