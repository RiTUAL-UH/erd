 Someone really ought to let the [gameday website](http://gameday.nd.edu/experience/athletic/) know about this. They still have it as a stadium tradition. 




 Fuck that. You always sing the alma mater. 




 He really hasn't improved that much since he was a freshman. He had a solid floor as a freshman, but pretty much no upside. 




 I hate the K. Not that I know what I'd replace it with, but the K looks weird. The Ws and Ls just looked so much nicer. 




 What if it's petty theft? 




 Get more in the bank. It's all about the frenzy lucky combo. 




 What if I learned something yesterday? Am I allowed to post it here? 




 I've never wanted anyone in a TV show to die more than I do Jesse right now. He just needs to be put out of his misery. That or he, Badger and Skinny Pete need to go get a farm in the middle of Idaho and chill there and watch Star Trek. 




 And who knows what happened to J.D. McCoy either. West Dillon had a black QB in season 5. Lance didn't like his BFF getting replaced. 




 I took a Business Problem Solving class in college. Probably my favorite class in my 4 years. Lot of being given problems and finding solutions. We'd bring in guests with problems and then write up memos and presentations about our solution. 




 I'm pretty sure this happened with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, except for the her not remembering it thing. Have you taken her to meet your Alzheimer's father and then fallen in love with her yet? 




 It's been this price on Amazon for months. 




 They're not going to be that successful streaming if they weren't competing at the highest level. It's the same with professional athletes. Someone like Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan made way more money from endorsements than they did from playing. But no one's going to pay you for it unless they were competing at the highest level. No one wants to buy shoes from Michael Jordan the random guy who went to school in North Carolina. 




 To show off your deceptive speed. 




 I think I still have PTSD with Crazy Train. 




 When aren't they? 




 Don't try to fight Carlo Calabrese. His people will get you. 




 That doesn't change the fact that Kelly's playcalling is also horrendous. 




 No I know today. But today is definitely a first from Big Ten refs. 




 I really thought that was against Robinson. Since when do B1G refs give us calls? 




 I'm terrified of what the commentary will be like when we play you. I'm not sure NBC will notice there's a game. 




 I would watch the shit out of a show where Jason Sudeikis coaches in the Premier League though. 




 In fairness, there's a video on the NBC sports website about Tommy Reese. 




 The Rex Grossman era Bears strategy. 




 I've been so spoiled by Amazon Prime. Had to send an Xbox into Microsoft for warranty repair and Fedex ground doesn't compare to 2 day UPS. 




 Finally something that makes me feel better about We Are ND. 




 But we need to be able to ask people what time the narwhal bacons so we can feel super cool. 




 Time for everyone to wear breakaway pants. 




 Snapchat selfie is the clear winner. 




 My middle school decided too many kids were looking at porn. They blocked google images. This was 7th grade, so half our presentations were find pictures of something and put them on a powerpoint.

My high school also didn't want people using the internet in one of the computer labs that was only used for computer classes, so they just deleted the browsers off those computers. It didn't take us long to realize you can browse in Windows Explorer. 




 "Make it so" OP, nerf pls. 




 I choose to believe you're not married and are actually going out to find a wife, not that you are and she's in another room or something. 




 If it were 5, I don't think Kmart or Target get any, since I'm sure Amazon is getting plenty, too. 




 There were middle school valedictorians? 




 You're not all good at hiding it. We had this super old English teacher in my high school who everyone knew had a flask in her desk. But she'd been there so long that she taught all the Vice Principals, so no one could really fire her. 




 I work at an IT help desk at a large state school. We also do work for a major community college system. It's amazing how many 20 year olds don't want to call in to have their password reset and have their parents call instead. Joke's on them because they still have to talk thanks to FERPA. 




 My issue with Weis is that he gets too cute. He wants to prove with his offense how smart he is instead of just using his players who are flat out better than the other team. Granted Kansas doesn't have players like that, so maybe he's a good fit. 




 Nah, he fails upward. Bama time. 




 We're already paying Weis to coach at Kansas, I'm sure we'd be happy to pay Kiffin to coach at USC. 




 I worked at a retail store for a while that had stopped selling CDs. So there was no display for them at all. I would have people ask me to check the back for CDs. Like we just kept all of them in the back so no one could buy them. 




 I don't care what system you're in, that's pretty impressive for a true freshman walk on. 




 Michigan sounded like they were going to cancel, too. They were just mad that it got cancelled with us getting 2 of the last 3 home games. 




 I prefer shitted. Like the midget from Trapped in the Closet. 




 I had a P.E. volleyball class the morning after St. Patrick's day my freshman year. Out of 30 people in the class, I think 6 or so had to leave class to throw up that day. That was probably the worst volleyball I've seen in my life. 




 There have been a lot of really inappropriate songs on Kidz Bop. Toxic was another. 




 It wouldn't have been able to have half those actors, though. 




 The lack of assists makes me wonder how they were even thinking those could be steals. 




 I've been hyperventilating since I read it. 




 And in greater numbers. 




 So you're 11? 




 Apparently they don't require the rappers to be nice like they do the girls. 




 I had a friend do really well with them. Not because he sold that many knives, but he recruited a friend of his to do that who sold a ton of knives. It's all about putting the pyramid scheme to work for you. 




 Fuck Free World, 313. 




 I especially find it weird when they say we. Personally I think you should only say we about an organization you've been a part of in some fashion.   




 I had a friend get asked "you're one of those asians, aren't you?" at a Taco Bell in Alabama. Not meant to be racist or anything. The woman genuinely wasn't sure. 




 Rolling Rock is also a little above the price point of what I'd consider cheap beer though. I'd go with Natty, Keystone, PBR, and Hamms, with Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light being around the top end of that. 




 Thug means never having to say you're sorry. 




 As far as cheap beer goes it's not too bad. I'll take it over natty or keystone. 




 And at least for Worlds that's in September/October. You're competing with playoff baseball, the NFL and college football. If I own a sports bar, I'm not bumping the end of the regular season or beginning of the playoffs for esports, and definitely not football. 




 I once had someone complain about how hipsters had ruined PBR because she drank it before they made it cool. I gave her a look and started to question her before she realized the irony of that statement. 




 I mean honestly, how often does anyone actually use the extra pockets in cargo shorts? I'm not sure I've ever used them in any pair I've worn. 




 I've driven some automatics with fairly weak engines that still rollback. Sucks in those, too. 




 Yeah for real, O'Rourke's is the CJ's of Eddy Street. 




 It's all about the salmon shorts now, yo. 




 Yeah Papa Smurfs from Between the Buns are probably a better option in that regard. Plus they already sponsor a bunch of minor sports anyway. I have a bunch of shirts from volleyball games that have Between the Buns ads on the back. 




 I say we go for fuck buckets from Feve. If for no other reason than I refuse to drink a Clover Quart from anything other than a mason jar, and that would get dangerous. Papa Smurfs would also be acceptable. 




 Also Willow and Wesley Wyndam-Price. 




 Make it TheYourTube. It's cleaner. Like TheNetflick. 




 Well I said Catholicism because for example Gordan Gee specified Catholics. Fielding Yost, while it was a long time ago, was definitely specifically anti-Catholic (also anti-immigrant). 




 One issue is that we don't want to be on the wrong end of a public vs. private school vote. Another is the history of anti-Catholicism in the B1G. 




 Just because they were amateurs doesn't mean they haven't dedicated their lives to it. College athletes are also amateurs (most anyway), but that doesn't mean they haven't spent most of their life dedicated to that sport. 




 They actually don't because they're available to everyone. If your school was free you wouldn't have to worry about scholarship limits. That's how Nebraska had such good walk on players for a while. They were pretty cheap in state. 




 The guy who played him was apparently just as excited. He kept asking when they would film that scene. 




 I didn't choose the Vayne Life, the Vayne Life chose me. 




 Runeless: An ESPN 30 for 30 production. 




 99 Luftballons. 




 I like to imagine they actually said LOL. 




 I had a guy on the other team be late because he was making Kool-Aid. It was grape though so it was ok. 




 I've had a few books that were kind of old that I needed before, I ended up paying $3.99 to ship a book that cost me a penny. One semester I think I spent almost as much in shipping as I did on books, not that I was complaining at that point. 




  (`)  




 I can't wait for ranked ARAM. 




 That's not even the tri state I know of that has Indiana, I consider it Indiana Ohio Michigan, since that's where Trine/Tri-State University is. 




 Honestly it's lack of talent. The Bulls are ridiculously deep, hence the strong regular season records, but star power wins championships. 




 Sorry, by that I meant season ending losses, i.e. playoffs series losses, since that's where their success was being questioned. 




 Catholic theology at the very least has a place for the "righteous pagans". Basically that the people who were good people but were never introduced to Christianity and therefore never had the chance to be saved can still be saved in the afterlife.  




 In fairness though, in the 3 years under Thibs, there's been 2 losses to the Heat, which imo are understandable due to the fact that Miami is flat out more talented at the top, and one where they lost right after their star and really only major scorer was hurt. They didn't have time to learn to play without him.  




 Because the Bulls have been showing a tendency to take any opponent for granted for the last 2 years. They basically play every game like it's the finals. 




 It's not anymore. 




 Just outside the last decade but the Cha Cha Slide will definitely be one. And the Cupid Shuffle in that same vein. Basically songs that have their own set of dance moves to go with it, preferably said during the song. 




 Truly the greatest song about [military bears](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twQlpFrm5iM). 




 5 years ago when minimum wage was still $6.55 Walmart was paying between 7 and 8 an hour by me. Target and Kmart were both paying $6.55. 




 I think she's got some vaginal hubris. 




 The second has Urkel though. 




 Of the 4 girls I've dated, 2 are married, one's engaged, and one's living with her boyfriend. The pattern seems to be marriage 5 years after they date me. I'm like a delayed version of Good Luck Chuck.

I should mention I just turned 23. 




 Kanye didn't become famous until after 9/11! I sense a conspiracy! 




 How exactly do you determine the sexuality of someone born 2000 years ago? Not to mention all the time he spent hanging out with prostitutes. 




 I had a boss last year who would tell all kinds of stories from his youth about stealing cars and drinking and doing drugs, all at the same time of course, and would always justify them with "It was the 70's". 




 I hope the prime directive doesn't often come into question in your marriage. 




 I was told to reinstall once. It didn't make me any better. 




 I enjoy the irony of people complaining about a feminist being important in gaming being the post right above 3 female cosplay posts.
