 Lol that gun is fucked 




 A fuck ton of girls like a single guy and the guy is indifferent and uncomfortable about it all the time like it isn't happening 




 Oh you were wondering what it was.  
Butts n' tits and tits n' butts 




 Oh yeah. Harem stuff too lol 




 It's pretty much SAO with more fan service and more background on how the main character grows. 




 Yeah it's pretty great lol  
People usually call is DanMachi for short though

 It's a pretty entertaining show to keep up with.  









 Saw that and shit my pants. Already posted it in the skype chat poser. 

I really fucking want it. 




 I'm just gonna settle with the plastic one to fit my budget for now and to review.  




 \\_()_/ 




 I mean, it can 




 Oh I like regular grips too lol

I just like shooting thumb over bore because it's relatively universal and works well. 




 Depending on arm length and position of the grip? Length of the rifle? 

Shooting thumb over bore provides maneuverability without a grip and works for multiple lengths of rifles 




 I feel like jumping on the opportunity and doing a review will generate me a poop ton of views 




 I'm ordering some pouches and shit, just a bunch of essentials and I have enough left for a CYMA M870, some shells, and a scabbard.

I feel like if I put up a review of it a lot of people will watch it also.  
Thoughts? 




 k bb I got osu waiting at home 3 xoxo 




 REEEEEEE~ 




 Just make a joke about OSU lol
 




 yee 









 feelsbadman 




 You talked to it and then cried to it? 




 Shooting thumb over bore looks a little silly, but it makes maneuvering easier and helps with aiming.  




 Tell your body pillow about it 




 Oh lol 




 Free Galaxy MP5k. All I had to do was reinstall the wiring, new motor, and pry out a BB from the nozzle.  




 All of the bad pictures don't have eye raping filters and all of the good pictures do. 




 Yeah it's all pretty listenable 




 I thought coldsteel trainers were santoprene?

Which is like rubbery? 




 Yeah I love me some good ska rock 




 Oh lol 




 What about a regular T1 riser that's the same height? 




 It's fake and rubber dude 




 The whole thing looks flawless, and then the riser is just an eyesore. 




 Weird 




 0/10 no hentai 




 *This is my kind of gun* 




 Lol what time zone are you even in? 




 I love these videos  




 Dude nuh uh  




 Where I work there's all waitresses but they all suck  




 Uh, no links anywhere? 




 I can't find a way to do that. My chrome isn't giving me the option. 




 Person who makes salads, *duh.* 




 Oh god it's so grainy 




 Airsoft is banned in Australia, that'd be an easy way to get your stuff taken away 




 74M 




 K 




 ayy  




 *You wanna see these hands?* 









 Cool cool man. We're just a chat sub that's kind of a subsidiary to the main /r/airsoft sub.  




 Yeah they deserve it. They rock. 




 This was really well put together. Thanks for the great video. 




 I thought you meant real knife lol 




 Like /r/mallninjashit style knife or just a nice knife? 




 Yeah seeing a Japanese dude with an afro was pretty great lol 




 Oh that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up.  




 Does kuundere just mean spacey and shit?  
Like Mashiro from Sakurasou? 









 Yeah good point.  




 I know lol. Just adding that because I didn't want to seem like a total dick. Maybe like, a partial dick.  




 Oh I wasn't talking about the tent thing. That has meaning behind it and you explained it lol. I was talking about the random pew pews or whatever 




 k 




 Oh lol.

Oreimo is good but a little weird.  




 I feel like this is a joke because I didn't much care for either show.  




 The paint jobs are cool but the random writing is kind of ugly 




 This reminds me of the time I gave a friend a sugar pill and told him it was ecstasy.  




 But you'd agree that an RATech'd out WE is better than a stock GHK right? 




 I need to stop resurrecting this laptop and get a PC lol 




 Okay then 




 Yeah these glasses are way more comfortable to me than my old ones 




 Oh my jimmies weren't rustled, I just explained lol 




 Sickles. 




 One time I saw a picture of a Gameboy Advance on one of their displays. Like, with the batteries and stuff.  




 Memes 




 Pepe sun? 




 I'll do it later, because I'm tempted lol 




 My computer is no longer kill. No more using IPad for me.  
Yusssssss 




 It's annoying as shit and it's not mine 




 That's a good tip.  
Also, I love my Condor MOPC to pieces. Definitely getting a other for my next loadout. 




 Condor MOPC is a cheap alternative. If you get the pouches right then it wouldn't look too different. 









 Oopsy, okay. Thanks for the chill message 




 I've always had a thing for NSR rail systems.  
I need to pick one up some day. 




 When my hair's like this I use glasses, longer hair/airsoft is contacts. 




 Then why recommend it for entry level GBBR users? 




 Better than a stock GHK 




 Yep.  
GHKWEWA.  

I would recommend WE and then getting all RATech parts though. 




 I'm 90% sure it's a unique system 









 Material and gas efficiency. Not a WA design, WE is better than WA 




 Is overpriced 




 He's wrong on most of that stuff 




 Yeah I've been doing this since 4th or 5th hour lol  




 Yeah thanks, that was actually pretty reasonable and was a good distraction for class lol. Usually arguments on reddit go to poo, so this was a breath of fresh air  




 Where's the other parenthesis I'm confused 




 Well there we are. Also, I wasn't saying KJW GBBR's were bad in any way, just saying that for the money he'd probably looking for a WE.  




 I can somewhat agree with this, but what OP is looking for is probably a WE M4 Open Bolt.  




 I was planning on either g-hopping and playing until the internals took a shit, or getting an HPA engine, g-hop, and wide bore combo.  




 WE's last pretty long stock and are more affordable than KJW M4's. They also have more upgrade options down the road, and have better quality control as of late. Plus, as the one guy said, the reason you see bad reviews is because more people buy them.

If more people buy something there'll be way more reviews of it.  




 WE doesn't break after a bag of BB's, that doesn't even make sense 




 Yeah WE has way more high quality aftermarket parts.  




 Still, why would you wear the bag like that lol  
It would be terrible trying to raise your weapon to aim 




 But with WE the quality control has gone up and there's plenty of good aftermarket parts that you can use to upgrade and make it better than a KJW M4?

As far as I know, there aren't as many decent aftermarket upgrades for the KJW as there is more for the WE. I'd take a stock WE Open Bolt M4 and an NPAS for like 300 or so with the option of upgrading with better parts than a stock KJW M4 for 375 or so. 

Also, WE mags are cheaper and aren't too hard to fix if they're leaking.  




 WE M4, more mags, RATech parts 




 You just seem to have a shit attitude and he was posting here because he knew he'd get the answer he wanted and it's not a bother? 




 DAE SIDEBAR GUISE GOSH 




 Link isn't working for me.  
Otherwise, how does it shoot stock? I've been looking into getting/building a DMR and I've been eye balling this gun.

Do you think I could get away with just a new spring and g-hopping it or what? 




 /r/theydidthemath 




 You thought changing the aesthetics of a gun made it shoot further?  
Are you LevelCap or something?  




 It'd look really cool if you used some tan goggles 




 This gun just sounds so terrible just by the words SRC and GBBR together 




 wat 




 I like the short one. If a sale comes along I'm very tempted to get one. 




 Oh don't pull that. UMP-45's are nice and it's hard to see how militia members could get theirs hands on them. It just doesn't fit the look and you know that too. 




 I was joking. *Gosh.* 




 Airsoft-SJW is a term that doesn't even make sense. Other than that I agree the hive mind is bullshit and I was just pointing something out. 




 His gear is too nice looking and the gun is wrong? 




 Le cumbut masheen DMR guise 




 Exactly. I wasn't saying his gear was bad or being a dick about it. Just stating what I saw really. 




 But they can't afford UMP-45's nor do they have accessibility to any 




 I really like it, I was just pointing out that it isn't specific to anything.   Just random gear is all. 




 So I was right 




 You need a kit list, and also this just seems like random gear and a Kenyan flag. 




 Oh yeah I agree the second is better than the first 




 I just fixed it. Now I'm sad. 




 7.62 milimeter. **Full. Metal. Jacket.** 




 Oh yeah dude I was gonna ask if you wanted to go see it in theater or some shit 




 I saw the scene with Chris Pratt going through the woods on a motorcycle with velociraptor bros and shit my pants 




 I knew about it and didn't get too excited until I saw one of the trailers while waiting to watch a YouTube video.

Needless to say I'm going to be checking for torrents every day now or going to see it with a friend. I can't miss Chris Pratt being bros with velociraptors. 




 *Neither did I* 




 Partially 




 Lol that username 




 Or a Colt C7 




 Aye
