 A few here and there but not every single year.  




 Most of his movies nowadays r shit but he is one of the biggest stars in the world and people pay to see his movies so theres that. Personally I think he should stop doing comedy and just start being in Dramas nowadays because he is really good at that but that will likely never happen.  




 I havent seen it but I wish David Ayelo got a nom for Selma.  




 Probably the stupidest "movie" I have ever seen in my life.  




 You expect me to watch Berlin!!!!  




 Most of the time the movies change things like certain plot points and stuff. So no its not if you want to know more about the world and stuff.  




 I kinda think he killed himself onstage and the last hospital scene is just a fantasy of his or something  




 Then why did he have conflicts with the director??? 




 God I hope Keaton or Carell wins for Best Actor.  




 God I wish they would just announce something already quit playing with my emotions!!!!  




 Yes and yes  




 I liked it and TBH I have no freakin idea if she is from the future or not.  




 YES!!!!!!!!!! I am already counting down the days.  




 Yes  




 Man that sucks for her LOL  




 WOW she should have said i wish I had a boyfriend  




 Christian Bale  




 you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight???  




 yes he did but they died a long time ago  




 So Hitler could understand her.  




 I kinda think he died there on the stage by really shooting himself and the final hospital scene is just his final thoughts, notice how everything goes good for him in that scene.  




 Bitches you bitches!!!!!!!!  




 Well now you know!!!!!!!  




 Yeah it was good I loved it.  




 its decided then  




 How bout Bradley Cooper in there for Best Actor.  




 Should I watch this tomorrow or Inherent Vice???  




 The Norton one didnt make that much money so Marvel decided to give up on giving the character his own series.  




 The Wicker Man 2006  




 Sutter thinks thats who he is.  




 that was also a tribute to Opie I believe.  




 LOL  




 Unforgiven or The Good bad and ugly those are the two best westerns IMO.  




 yes it is.  




 well he said call him so just put two and two together.  




 Thats what I have always wondered too I mean he just left them in a room with a madman LOL.  




 It had his phone number on it.  




 No he wont be nominated even though he deserves it.  




 Yeah true Sutter kind of retconned some stuff, I wonder if in later years him and Piney grew apart and Clay and JT became best buds thats why TellerMorrow was formed.  




 That explains why my Netflix Canada site wasnt working last night.  




 Yeah true but for the shows that arent on netflix too like Community and South Park its better than going to some sketchy website and stuff.  




 Harkins theaters $7.25 all the time because I am a student. the normal price is $10.25 usually. At AMC its like $5.20 or something.  




 whoa I literally just watched that movie too!!!! 









 O okay I get it now. Thanks!!! 




 No  




 Yeah some not all of it tho.  




 Wolverine Origins is no longer canon Fox basically swept it under the rug.  




 Thank you  




 True I guess I just wanted Jax to live above all else rather than the typical main character is an antiherro so the final scene is him dying ending.  




 So I was wondering when JT died and Clay suceeded him as President was he already VP?? Why wasnt Piney VP since he was one of the cofounders and stuff. Just something I was wondering.  




 I kinda wanted to have it end with Jax getting away with the murders of Gemma, Unser, Marks, and Barofsky. Then he sends his kids away and still stays on as President just a broken man though who finally makes it legitimate.  




 Too late he has already done that.  




 Sylvester Stallone  




 Yes true  




 Thank you!!!!  




 Yes I saw that now IO dont have to use Hola unblocker to watch Community.  




 yeah true but who would ever pay 100 for ads   




 I like it so far except for the ads I already have Netflix too so I guess my entertainment needs r taken careof for a few months!!! I cant wait til my shows start coming on again in January so I can no longer download stuff and I can just stream them.  




 Yeah he didnt really leave them with a lot of plausible deniablility.  




 wow someone loves birdman  




 So what do yathink the club is up to now??? It is in good hands with Chibs as President but I wonder what kind of adventures they will have now that the teller family is gone basically.  




 LOL  




 Spiderman 3  




 alright Drax  




 its gay  




 I wish he would do another Tron but disney has its hands full with Star Wars and Marvel  




 Twilight because its Gay  




 Well I want it to be nominated but usually that means it wont get a nom.  




 Hes a really good actor hope he gets an Oscar some day.  




 Beat me to it.  




 After they refused to stream it exclusively in the first place??  




 I liked it it was really funny, maybe I should rewatch it havent seen it for awhile.  




 I LOVED IT!!!!!! So glad the terrorists didnt win and i got to watch this IN a Theater. Also Some guy had a seizure while watching it and we all got free movie tickets because of that.  




 ahhh sorry to hear that.  




 never  




 Yes  




 I believe I mean the battle of the five armies.  




 I have gotten into a few actually one was wether or not the cartoons and comic were in canon, one was who was better the jedi or the sith and another was darth maul vs darth vader.  




 Yes Star Wars  




 Good movie I loved it one of the few that made me cry.  




 From what I hear the directors cut is exactly 30 minutes longer.  




 Lots of them.  




 Interesting  




 Okay thanks dude guess I will see it on christmas day like I originally planned.  




 Because I want to.  




 In my theater it is there for at least a week.  




 So I really want to see the Interview on Opening Day there is a theater close to me that is showing it but I am still spooked by the terror threats, should I watch it opening day or wait a few days???  




 Why just why???  




 There was naked people??  




 Well whoever gave him the drink is a murderer!!!!!  




 Oklay that makes sense but wow 20.  




 20 movies?? Seriously???  




 Yeah true  




 O okay interesting.  




 do they charge you 99 flat?? or is it broken up into monthly payments??  




 Okay hmm I still havent decided but thanks!!!!!  




 no  




 So I already have Netflix but I was thinking of adding Amazon instant too just to see what the selection is like too, should I do it?? It might be worth it just to see all of the HBO shows too.  




 Cool  




 He was a terrorist.  




 This sucks balls  




 Man I was looking forward to a dangerous visit to the movie theater on Christmas Day. I hope you are Happy Cyber Hackers.  




 torrents although most of them can be found on youtube  




 Man I still listen to that song it is on my iphone!!!!  




 AHHH thats so nice, I wanna reread this book again now.  




 Yes completely agree.  




 13 Reasons Why it got me thinking how life is so precious and how people can come and go in your life.  




 Yes they could do some kind of crossover movie with marvels two teams that would be pretty cool actually.  




 LOL  




 What are some of the easiest paychecks for actors in movies???
