 I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene  




 Recently I've been listening to the Highstreet allstars and I've noticed somthing. A lot of their songs use old melodies, like their track freeze is "what do we do with a drunken sailor" 3kings is (I'm spacing right now but it sounds really familiar) and rock that beat is an old Celtic song called "son ar christr" I think it's pretty cool when artists put a spin on classic melodies. I want to find more songs, hardstyle or otherwise thanks in advance :) 




 I'm still a beginner so don't be too hard on me :)   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fqsax6flnvqwcqd/AABlGrvugc4g-8R_6xj4NNuia?dl=0

QUICK EDIT!: use these how ever you see fit! Just be sure to link me the songs made with them, I'm interested to see what you guys come up with :) 




 thank you Sam, I always love these story's 

EDIT: I love "Lad Riffs" Hahah, Steriophobia, Superstar DJ, Fucking posers (maybe I need to listen to that song again) and Do you wanna ballon? Man... You just made me realize that I need to listen to more old hardstyle  




 Holy shit... Is that Dio in there? 




 Yes? :(... It doesn't have to be a kick you worked super hard on  




 Post a project file and a WAV. Render, doesn't matter what DAW you use and it doesn't matter what kind of kick it is, it can be a normal distorted kick, a reverse bass, a hardcore kick heck I'd even be down for a nice gated kick. I think it would be cool to see how we all make our kicks and maybe help out those who are having trouble. I'm not at my computer right now but I'll post some files when I am :) 









 Niiiiiiicccce, good mastering on this, I have afew criticisms (if you are the guy who made this) the reverse bass sounds like it could be a little more distorted and while I understand what you are trying to do with the vocals they sound a little boring, maybe you could get a girl friend to do the vocals and give it that aggressive human element. Besides the two things that I mentioned everything else is their, good job on this one :)
    




 [Right here!](http://kinzoku.xxxxxxxx.jp/tmfgh.html) 




 It is illegal, but only in certain ways (   ) 









 I get really worked up sometimes, at points I'm on top of the world and at others I'm getting my ass kicked by little girls, I've only played EOTSD and Faith Mountan, Meiling always kicks my ass because I can never read her patterns, I remember barely scraping by her once only to be killed before I reached the first boss encounter in the level then having to go to the score screen and have sakyua silently judge me with her dead unmoving eyes and go alllllllll the way back to the beginning, I just want to fight sakyua ;_;. Then in faith mountain Momiji's bullet patterns always make me panic so I end up wasting all my bombs  




 will the based freq tell us a story? /u/audiofrq plz 









 and its fixed! thank you!  




 Oh, sorry I'm not home right now so I couldn't check (the screenshots aren't mine I just used them as an example) thank you :) 




 Thank you but again that's not what I ment, I'll try to be very specific this time :), ok so normally when you put a pattern in the playlist, the notes show up as a [greyish white](https://audiodestrukt.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/fl-live-playlist.png), I think a accidently hit a key or something along those lines because now when I put a pattern in the playlist the notes show up [colored](http://cdn.mos.musicradar.com//images/Tutorial%20images/Tech/fl-studio-tips/fl-studio-slicer-460-85.jpg), seriously though thanks for your help, I'm learning things I didn't know before :) 




 Sorry, what I mean is the actual notes inside the pattern are showing up colored like green, purple and blue all inside one pattern  




 How do I make [this](http://youtu.be/6x5RshIRrno) FX kick? It starts at 0:56 and you can also hear it multiple times starting at 1:55 




 My main complaint is that you can't set a decay time, meaning that the kick tail could be a minute long if you wanted it to be, otherwise this is a great little Vst. it's got some pretty good presets and one of my favorite producers I:gor worked on it [get it here](http://distocore.net) 




 Me too, I am also very interested in this  




 Harmor can also do this  




 I love how obvious it is that Sam is doing the vocals for this one 

EDIT: fantastic reverse bass, a lot of my favorite reverse bass tracks come from Bioweapon/Audiofreq  









 If you have FL I recommend [this guys](http://youtu.be/nFI2CdFY_3M) tutorials he also makes hardstyle if your interesed (hardstyle kicks can teach you a lot about kick making) also try synthesizing your own kick tails it's alot of fun and it gives it that personal touch  




 I fucking love this artist, his/her art style is so cool 




 Ima fite u m8 




 They had potential, I was a huge fan of live for the night but eventually they just dropped off my radar, I never really liked the girls that much like what /u/Nezzatic said, a bit trashy. They got my attention with United kids of the world but in all honesty it wasn't that good of a song, it felt like Headdy and the girls could have done better and now with the whole rainman thing why even bother, I mean they lost their producer, where do they go from there?

EDIT: I forgot about party monster! Huge fan of that song production was fantastic  




 I would love to see a video of that 




 I like it, simple yet refined

Edit: or how about what ever Gabes wife's name is, because behind every God is a Goddess  




 what should we name her? It should be something elegant, something powerful, something that encapsulates the essence of PC gaming   









 *desperation for full comic series intensifies*  




 hmm I don't know much about about ambient but that doesn't mean I still cant help you :) [try this one on for size](http://freesamplepacks.net/dark-ambient-sounds/)       




 Ah I understand, ok let me re-answer I don't know of any cheap daws but their are plenty of free vst's and sample packs just waiting to be found, check out this sub, along with Google, also what kind of music are planing on making? 




 we cant link you any torrents on here but do some hunting if you really want to.   




 oh how dumb of me!! filters, why didn't I think to use filters! (ga!) thanks for the enlightenment friend :D  









 Thank you, so if I wanted a 3 band one I would just do the same thing except with 3 tracks and I would cut the mids from one? 




 I know their are plenty of plug-ins/vst's but I'm really interested in making my own, I use FL so if anyone could point me towards any tutorials or explain the process to me that would be fantastic :) thanks in advance  




 Ohmicide, it's a pretty nice multiband distortion unit but I can never get anything I like out of it. 









 Lights laugh/face during the laugh...... A sweet cherry on top of a great Sunday also I paused it when I was watching it with my friend and said "that face is someones wallpaper" 




 DYK that Dan Green did voice acting for bible black? 




 Or it could be played first given that it's the slowest/saddest so the hype ratchets up as the party goes on, also as a special bonus a plague of gripes set with all grey lights and music consisting of [noise](http://youtu.be/2toGkIfGFVU) and creepy animal sounds 




 Duuuuude! TBF warehouse party! Everyone wares pop culture/anime/hype shirts and we have a 4 hour party with a 1 hour set for each member, the music and lighting changes for each one

Woolie: all green lights with a set consisting of fighting game themes and rap that ends with the sound of rock salt being poured into something 

Pat: red, yellow and orange lights with a set consisting of silent hill music that moves into Irish folk songs and heavy metal

Liam: pink, yellow and light blue lights with a set consisting of j-core, j-metal and anime remixes 

And finally Matt: red, white and blue lights with a set consisting of 80's action movie themes, wrestler themes and platinum games ost's also throughout the set you can hear predator growling and for the slow dance with Matt and his wife; snake eater.  









 Great seeing more of angerfist around here 




 Wow... I had no idea kidd kaos made stuff like this. I've always loved his hard trance but this is fantastic! Thanks for sharing :) 




 I was thinking I could set up a plug.dj room and I could do a mix consisting of rap, video game ost's, electronic music and other stuff. Plus we could all chat and have fun. Let me know what you all think :) 




 I beat peace walker! Now all I need to do is grow a beard and play ground zeros and my indoctrination into the MGS series will be complete! Then the wait will officially begin for me 




 Is their a cut off year for this? Because if not I can't wait for him to play quantum of solace that game was better then expected  




 Perfect  




 Kick making :) as you can probably tell by my flair kicks are a big part of the music I make, weather it be the over driven sound of a gabber kick, the dry dusty omf of a gated kick (gated kicks are commonly used in hard trance), the aggression of a frenchcore kick, the power of a hardstyle kick or the solid thunk of a UK hardcore kick. Theirs something about synthesizing or editing one from a sample pack that is just so relaxing and fun, plus it's so cool to hear how just a little EQing can change so much about the character of a kick 




 I like to imagine his mom calling him down for dinner while he's in the middle of this. 

Mom: (in French accent) Hugo come down and have soup


Him: (in angry french accent) not now mom this mix down is giving me problems ;_; 




 This is the only [speedcore lable](https://www.speedcore.ca) I know of 




 Neeeevvverrrr compare yourself to your influences it never helps the creative process at all. Simply keep doing what your doing and most importantly HAVE FUN! 




 I know what you mean, I just wanted to show the whole sound spectrum so I got a little lazy plus the last few notes of the melody just don't sound right to me (I found some midi online) 




 Wrestling, my friend just ate it up, he bought so many DVDs, toys and even that wwe car combat game 




 [heres the patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0)
[heres the FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fgqsiw0eju5zhi2/pluck%20test.flp?dl=0)
and finally [heres how it sounds](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/pluck-test), enjoy and be sure to link me any songs you've made with it (you don't need to credit me I'm just interested to see what you come up with)  




 Hey it's cool, the more you know right? It doesn't surprise me that it was figure he loves horror, his monsters albums are one of the many things I look forward too in October  




 But then theirs [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2yfzlp/nnn_message_gabber_2014_japanese_hardcore_is_so/) 




 I can understand :P I personally love terrorcore but at points it dose get to be too insane/gross, also was the person you walked out on [this guy](http://youtu.be/dx99U5KcwNQ) 

EDIT: I'm supposed to tell you why I like it! I like it because it's fast and it's frantic and some of the people who make it are masters of drum programing. Also it's just diffrent and it shows how you can take a concept like horror and turn it into awesome music! Check out [this mix](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs) 




 the dark oscillators used to be made up of Luca antolini, technoboy and tuneboy (and afew other people) so check them out 




 I've seen more and more hardcore submissions get more upvotes lately... Gabber's gaining ground ;)  




 Ohhh shittt! Good idea dude! Super best animators 1 hour podcast we would finally get to hear 2snacks sexy Brazilian accent, hear Cranky confess how he's a furry and has been hiding it (kind of) all these years and finally hear zone talk about ~~her~~ his dick shading techniques, also I know I'm making a joke but I really want this to happen, like really badly 




 Or the moans of various cartoon charters throughout only to be hushed by some unknown horror  




 Also dose zone have a reddit account? If not ~~she~~ he should get one 




 I already know about POS and Noisekick and I need more! I'm really in love with terror right now, thanks in advance :) 




 Who would be the super intendant? My money's on RAGE, he would just kick down someone's door and proclaim I AM HERE TO FIX THE LEAKY PIPE! Also if this ever happens I would volunteer to be a writer in a heartbeat  




 I would like to imagine that all the people who do creepy sex stuff use the dungeon and none of them know that someone else uses it too. So their could be moments of "how did this horse dildo get here?" "What's up with this ball gag?" And a one point their could be an episode where they all meet, it would open with Plague doing some creepy animal thing and Yahtzee would walk in waring his gimp suit and they would lock eyes and then Jole from vinesause would walk in waring a Kermit the frog mask  




 What if Yahtzee moved in next door, they would think that a very vocal British Australian political journalist moved in  




 2swood4me 




 and then above Gav and Micheal is Jon Tron just eching it up all day and a running gag could be they think he's a chain smoker because all they hear coming from the apartment is ECH! ^^^ECH! ILL GET MY SWOOORRDDD DANNY!!!  




 Round wave crusher 

Kobaryo 

Angerfist

Noisecontrollers 

Ophidian 




 Round Wave Crusher, he has a new album coming out very soon and he's the the person that introduced me the whole
J-core scene. I know a lot of people on here don't like fast music (200 and over stuff) but seriously give him a chance, it takes awhile to get used to fast music but once you do, you will want to hear more! Believe me I know I used to absolutely despise anything over 200. Anyways here's one of my favorite songs by him, the melody is so dark and catchy, may I present to you.... [Voices (in my head)](http://youtu.be/UWaCPTgUNsk) he also did a redo of this on his Unhinged E.P.

EDIT: also You, You just blows my mind on so many levels, he makes really good happy hardcore but at the same time he can do incredibly fast music very well. He also has anime remix albums up on his site for free, check him out at [foryousounds.com](http://www.foryousounds.com) 




 No problem :) 




 I sure do! [This is my favorite song by him](http://youtu.be/AHVBBWwB1Io) he also makes hardcore under the name ophidian if your interested

EDIT:[album showcase](https://soundcloud.com/sebastiaan-kleinjan/gazing-long-into-the-abyss-album-showcase) 




 Fuck yes! Thanks for adding it to the list dude. Also have you ever heard of meander? He's one of my favorite crossbreed artists  




 Oops, looks like I need to get gud 




 Your forgetting one genre (depending on if you like it)... Crossbreed, crossbreed is a combination of DnB and hardcore, really cool
stuff check out "The Outside Agency" if you want to hear some (they are the founders of the genre) otherwise flawless list dude it's nice to see someone so dedicated to a genre they love 




 Oh man oh jeez their are so many things I need to do, I need to upgrade my pc, I need to buy more MG's games and I need to send in my PS3 because the disc tray is broken :/ 




 rules of nature?
 




 taken from the dying light video 









 The vid quality is bad, but the part about the home work made me laugh really hard 









 One of the better Schranz aragements I have heard in a while! Also for those who don't know... Schranz is a kind of hard techno that focuses on phat, chunky rolling beats rather then the kicks  









 Fuck I still need to buy peace walker, and then buy ground zeros and then get super hype for September 1 




 The Simpsons is my favorite anime  














 to who ever did this.... thank you 




 Captain were taking on too much lewdness, we may need to start evacuating the crew soon 




 Not my favorite hardsound album but it has my favorite cover art I mean seriously just look at that shade of pink... Also I should make a confession. I got into Touhou through the musical arrangements I heard on YouTube, weather it be hardcore, jumpstyle, schranz or hardstyle I would listen to it. Also I've only played two of the games, embodiment of the scarlet devil and faith mountan  









 *gets up from fireplace* what an interesting story also wow Australian born Colombian you must have had a diverse childhood 









 Maby if we're patient Uncle Sam will tell us the story behind this one 




 Yes! thank you  




 I remember it was one of those "I'd like some feedback on this" kind of posts and everyone really seemed to like it, it was a Rawstyle track and a remix (possibly) thanks for in advance! 




 Dose anyone think their should be a Noisia version of the discovery movie? 




 I did ;) [heres a link to the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2uw03m/lisa_lashes_alex_kidd_vs_kidd_kaos_nu_religion/) 




 Hey wait a minute I remember you! Your the guy who asked for hard trance suggestions :D how have you been enjoying it so far? 




 check out QULT 




 Heres the [FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/45av9r0srbhrkdd/Devestate%20Dominate%20Eleimiate.flp?dl=0)
Right now its just samples from the blutonium hardstyle sample pack, im hoping to make it a lot more and a lot better! have fun with it  :) 









 This is hardcore ;) 




 Strobe 









 Me too man 




 Believe it or not he actually has a hardstyle alias, sadly he's only [released one song under it](http://youtu.be/0wXZJues_bs) 




 I'm really hoping for some Gabber in the near future 




 [Try this mix on for size](http://youtu.be/HIw1DsZD8NA) it's a tech trance mix, if you don't want to listen to the whole thing just look at the track list in the description, all the artsists listed make really good tech :)

And if you want to get into hard trance [heres one of my favorite mixes](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) and a [mix I did](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/exploring-the-dreamscape) 




 Wow! This is actually pretty good, the kick sounds like it's pushing the melody out of the way a bit but otherwise it's really good 




 As we all know 16bit broke up awhile ago and awhile later Eddie Jefferys came back as MoodyGood (bless him his sound design is amazing) but what happened to Jason? I remember hearing that he started making trap as "we are the 13" or something like that, theirs even a link to his SC on the old 16bit FB page but it's a dead link :/ so dose anyone know what happened to the guy? 




 Fuck yes I love angerfist, this whole album is a winner, also did you know that gabber started in the Netherlands? And that the listeners were usually punks and outcasts who were just looking for something to do? Gabber has an interesting history

 You might want to ask this on /r/edmprouction nice pepole and you will get some good advice :) also I use Vocodex and I really like it 









 "Teaches ages 12-16 years old" :0.... Excuse me mr. visi- I mean mr. (What ever the visions last name is) I think I hurt my ankle, could you take escort me to the nurses office? *On the way there* sooooo... Whats your go to synth, what distortion modal is your favorite and will you check out my mixtape? 




 Hello everyone! As the title says I need some help with making a subground kick, Specifically [this one](http://youtu.be/sYZcgn-sJho) it sounds to me like a big room kick with some distortion and some EQing to bring it out a bit, any guesses on how this kick was made would be great! Also if you make subground why not share some info on your kick making process (/u/audiofrq) I'm looking at you ;) thanks much 




 sure thing dude  




 Maybe try this? http://www.vitorrent.cc/search/camel+audio+alchemy+1.5 




 Sure thing dude, I don't know of any but I'll take a look for you. Also *gives pat on back* 




 Sure thing dude! I'll link you the site where I get most of my Japanese stuff (most of it is physical release only so I have resort to a lot of torrenting/unofficial downloading :/) [here](http://touhourecords.blogspot.com/?m=1) although you can find some stuff on iTunes, if you find it for free but also find it on iTunes buy it to support the artist! unofficial downloading/torrenting is a last resort for me 




 Here are some artists 

Dutch: Angerfist, Neophyte, The Viper, Nosferatu, Endyminion, The Playah and Ophidian

Italian: DJ Mad Dog, AniME, The Art Of Fighters, Amnesys, Nico and Tetta and Meccano Twins

Japanese: DJ Noriken, moro, DJ Sharpnel, Kobaryo, t+pazolite, kenta-v.ez., Noizenecio, RoughSketch, DJ Myosuke and 6th

As for records: Angerfist - The Deadfaced Dimension, Nosferatu - Nocturnal By Nature, Ophidian - Between The Candle and The Star (this one is reeeelly good!), Art of fighters - Words of war, DJ Sharpnel - The Sharpnel sound albums, moro - The Gensou hardsound compilations, If your looking to get into old school hardcore the gabberbox compilations (their fucking expensive though $30 a pop) and if your looking to get into speedcore the Psycho Filth Records 500 over!, 600 over! and 666 over! Compilations, I have 666 over! and it's frickin sweet! 




 Sure thing man, check out the Japanese Stream Hardcore compilations, Japanese Hardcore sounds a lot diffrent from most Dutch/Italian Hardcore 




 Mainly the melodys and saw synths, also the kicks, some pepole just really like the aggressive sound 




 Thanks for the advice. but I still am curious, is their a way to get them to work with FL? 




 Recently I found out about this --- http://www.phuturetone.com and I was wondering if I could use rewire some how to make the plug ins work in FL or dose rewire not work that way?

Edit: I should probably clarify that I only have FL studio 




 Ask some one who already has it, I know that producers sometimes keep installs to give to friends. If you don't know anyone with it you will have to torrent it :/ 




 Do you have sytrus? 









 "Dante chases rage" what?!? Rage runs from no man Rage dose not understand the concept of being chased, the games are rages equivalent of a vacation 

"Blanka and rage tell story's to eachother" Blanka: I can't wait to see my mommy Rage: this one time I destroyed a skyscraper just by looking at it..... HAHAHAAA! 




 This guy gets it  









 Unf... Those kicks! Also check out the gensou hardsound compilations, there fucking awesome (this song isn't on any of the comps though) 









 An odd thing to post here but believe me when is say all of these tracks are fantastic despite being so fast, if your looking to get into fast music check this one out along with their 500 Over! and 600 Over! Compilations  









 holy shit dude! bring snacks because we need to get to the [bunker](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1390/58/1390580499294.gif)
  




 this happened to me also, I shot Sam an email and he sent me the DJ edit and the radio edit. (Sam's a cool guy) just shoot him an email if apple dosn't get back to you :)   




 stamp on the ground by the italo brothers 
 




 nightcore at its most basic level is just any song sped up about 10-30 BPM at that point you get warping and people who enjoy that are people who I distance myself from. on another level people actually remix the track but I'll just stick to happy/UK hardcore   




 if your an anime fan checkout star driver  




 man... Matt looks really good with glasses 




 That was awesome! and then the part with the revolvers, and after ocelot is just like see us later fuckers and peaces out in the dumbest/best way possible 




 Alright alright alright! Thanks dude 




 Oh man that cock block ending tho 




 Fuck ya man! [Spoiler](#s "just to be sure your talking about the fight between ocelot and snake right?")  




 Quick question for ground zeros... Digital or physical copy, am I missing anything if I buy digital? 




 I fucking did it! I beat it!
