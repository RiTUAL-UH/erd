 Was this in the SAS Klan Obliteration server? 




 It boggles me how people from Western cultures are so tolerant with an outdated culture that doesn't even respect human rights. Swedes really need to open their eyes, because once the 3rd world immigrants are there doing bad stuff, there won't be an easy way to revert the situation. 




 Yeah I got that problem a few times lately and only a reboot would fix it. So I installed the DirectX on the BF4 redist folder and so far so good. 









 RemindMe! Oct 18th Download PayDay on Steam! 




 It wasn't just based on the poorly optimized crap Watch Dogs is. I play BF4 a lot and there were some AMD-related memory leaks that were never fixed, and the game crashed if I tried enabling MSAA. Not to mention AC Unity and Far Cry 4 are coming out soon :) 




 Yeah I said medium because I kept in mind graphical evolutions like the Unreal Engine 4. Well, I'm glad to know that :) 




 I had an old HD5850 from when I built my PC in late 2009.  It was starting to suck on games like Watch Dogs and 1-2 months ago I decided to get a MSI GTX 760 Twin Frozr 2gb for 234 (cheapest I could find). 

Should I have waited for a price drop and got the 770?
Will this card + my i7 920 @stock still run games in medium 1080p 60fps in 2-3 years? 




 ^THIS.
Youtube has such an aggressive compression I have to upscale some videos to 4K for them to look like 1080p. 




 This is the first time it happened to me. Well, it happens a lot with the ragdoll physics, but not while I'm still trying to kill the dude. 




 AWS has infinite ammo, I just didn't stop shooting :p 









 Damn ._.
Overly manly grandpa 




 My grandfather once told me something I consider to be incredibly useful and valuable to me.
It was a story, back from the old days when he worked. His workplace had a cafeteria, which sometimes had a full stock of food and beverages. Certain greedy workers noticed this and started taking them home and/or wasting them. And of course, after a while, there weren't enough food and beverages.
 "If we use our resources slowly, they'll always be enough.
 But if we get greedy and abuse them, they'll never be enough".

Fortunately he's still alive, but since he's 81, I fear it won't be for long :(
 




 I changed the birth date of some friends' Green Cards so they could go to a club (took a copy and photoshopped them). According to them, it worked. 




 Not being able to hold a conversation. Sucks when I ask a long question and she replies "yeah" or "lol".  




 Hardline is good enough, but not for full price. It's like a cops   criminals DLC to BF4. I'll probably buy it, but for a VERY discounted price on G2A (25-30). 




 Rich people sure know how to live. 




 But if you oppose to it, you're an evil nazi and the cancer of society. This isn't Sweden but I bet they have really similar situations. Where hard working people sponsor the life of those who don't contribute to society... 




 It would be considered racism if there were blondes touching black kids' skin and hair instead. 




 Someone link to the thread :p 




 God bless Vikings and their fast Internet connections. 




 When people said Internet in the US was bad in many areas, I was thinking of 5-10mb. But certainly not that O_O 




 Yet another reason to love Norway 




 Pale girls with blonde hair and blue eyes. 




 A woman pregnant with triplets was a victim in a robbery, and was shot 3 times in the belly. She went to the doctor and he said although the bullets reached the triplets, it wasn't in a critical zone, and eventually the bullets would come out their bodies. 2 healthy girls and a boy were born.

After 12 years, one of the girls was peeing, when she peed the bullet.

- "Mommy, some metal thing just came out of me" - she said.
So, mom explained to her what had happened when she was pregnant.
A week after that, the other girl was peeing, the same thing happened, and the mom explained it again.

After another week, the boy was in the bathroom and calls his mom.

- "Mom, you won't believe what just happened!" - he screamed.

- "It's OK son, you just peed some metal thing, wasn't it?" - she replied.

- "What? No! I was masturbating here in the bathroom when suddenly our dog died". 




 Did he have to disassemble, debug and patch the projector? :) 




 Model from Google Earth :p 




 That only happened with Sniper Elite 3, as far as I know. And I'm sure that with G2A shield you'd get this problem sorted out. 




 PhysX would be nice and it sounds plausible, considering previous GTAs were part of the TWIMTBP program. 




 They'll probably be enhancing DRM and downgrading the graphics. Bunch of crooks 




 I'm rather new to the Battlefield universe. I've only played BF3 (singleplayer) and BF4 (singleplayer + 400 hours of multiplayer) and I like the fact they offer modern warfare, but not futuristic (at least, not that much until Final Stand).
I just don't care for futuristic games with robots and super galactic weapons and stuff like that. I think Titanfall and COD are already enough when it comes to this matter, despite their differences to Battlefield. 

Then again, I might be wrong. I didn't play BF2142 after all. What's your opinion? 




 Ah I see. Thanks! 




 Oh, I see. thanks! 




 Every combination is wrong in Medal of Honor (assuming the missing letter/number if after "DAD" 




 Someone used Medal of Honor and didn't say anything. 




 I don't get it?
