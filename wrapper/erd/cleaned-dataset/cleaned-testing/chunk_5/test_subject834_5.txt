 What about acid? (low doses) 




 Temazepam is good. A lot of people actually say Xanax is the most recreational BENZO, but etizolam (pretty sure that's RC, if its not been regulated yet) is considered to be extremely recreational to some but I've heard some people don't feel anything from it but still black out somehow. I also think Midazolam is one of the more recreational benzos out there too but I believe it's pretty sedating and creates a lot of amnesia (they use it as a sort of pre anesthetic). I also believe Flunitrazepam is considered really, really recreational. Basically what I'm getting at is that it all depends on the person and what that person personally wants out of a drug and how they react to it. 

Edit: Benzos all in all aren't considered that recreational though, but alot of people obviously do find them recreational.  




 Promethazine is shit. I don't know why people like to take it with codeine. In large doses it blocks dopamine receptors and is a mild antipsychotic.

 Good question. 




 I don't think it's neurotoxic no. I believe oxycodone is derived from the thebaine part of opium. 




 Are you considering rape, sir? 




 You either missed out on a good dick suck or you dodged an STI/STD. 




 Fuck seroquel lol. I take that for the real reasons it's prescribed (schizophrenia) and that shit will knock you out no matter what, and if you have to wake up early for school or work it'll still be sedating as fuck. 




 I'm a certified reddit doctor and I think it's foot cancer.  




 It's just the oxy, this is what opiates do that's why people get addicted to things like heroin.  




 [that was dreadful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjnkV_tsjn0) 




 Because opiates are better than sex? 




 Medications have never stopped the cognition decline for me. It feels like I'm developing dyslexia and fucking dementia right now.  




 You're right, they do get rid of the positive symptoms for a while but they're never completely gone. Negative symptoms have probably interfered with my life more than the positive, I think. 




 Pretty much just described what basic methylphenidate is also, both have the same effects more or less except ritalin will only last around an hour.  




 Isn't there images released now that show him with his thumb practically blown off from the recoil of the shotgun? 




 There was quite a lot of heroin found in his blood when they found his body.  




 Nirvana is my favourite band and kurt cobain is probably my favourite person that I never knew personally. RIP brother. 




 Have to keep up the health while injecting some tar.  




 People say valium but I believe he was prescribed rohypnol. 




 WAIT, WHAT YEAR IS THIS? 




 Ethylphenidate, Methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are all my faves. 




 Not even... Wait, I'm smoking it right now. 




 I've been on old anti psychotics and new ones, and the current one I'm supposed to take is Seroquel and it feels like a fucking elephant is jumping on your back. 

The hard drugs I currently do are anything opiate.  




 Antipsychotics are completely shit, it's extremely hard to function on most of them, and then when you find a drug that's deemed "illegal" but helps you and you can still function, psychs will still say it'll make you worse.  




 [After a few months it just becomes as boring as breathing air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0cQSFCSENI) 




 INTP and pretty much do opiates exclusively.  




 Not read it yet but I like the title, you like Nirvana? 




 It's fucking Tuesday here. 




 Would probably be listed as a Schedule 1 movie.  




 Not even close. 




 Okay... /u/iCoy told you why scamming ruins the game and you just replied with, 100% irrelevant, as if you don't care that people get scammed (or you don't think its that bad that it can ruin a game) therefore you probably have scammed people in the past, think about it... 




 "Scammer spotted" means I molest children, you should work for the FBI.  




 Scammer spotted.  




 I remember when I was off for a year and came back, got 1 win and went back to MG2. 




 Maybe he doesn't get 144fps+ in other games? 




 Yeah, I use 1024x768 with -freq 75 but 1080p 60hz on my desktop, definitely makes the game a lot smoother.  




 I don't think I've ever actually seen 2G.  




 IV morphine is stronger than oral oxycodone, so if OP is willing to shoot some morphine up then it would be: Hydro, Morphine (oral), Oxycodone, Morphine (IV) etc.  




 Heroin WILL kill you, you don't even need to OD you will just magically DIE because you're using HEROIN, did you know that? We just use things in the hospital setting and sometimes outside the hospital that is around 90x stronger called fentanyl, BUT ITS HEROIN THAT DOES IT NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE ITS ILLEGAL. 

Edit: Quote: "Give an addict heroin and there is a chance they will die. Not because of fentanyl. But because they are an addict that is doing heroin."... This whole article is retarded.  




 Fuck her and fuck this generation that don't give a fuck about anyone else and are so fucking naturally narcissistic... I'm sorry for your loss, it would devastate me if someone I loved died.  




 Everyone on reddit is a pharmacologist or a dr.  




 Finally something creepy on here.  




 [You tried, that's all that counts](http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/86116-At-Least-You-Tried.png) 




 You should draw more, and maybe in colour? That AWP looks really nice, good job.

 I may be wrong or misunderstanding here but it said, "The SURVIVAL rate of the current outbreak is around 40%", not the fatality rate. 




 Holy shit... I thought I was crazy for the longest time, I do this too.  




 It's not got withdrawals anywhere close to heroin, but the psychological addiction is definitely comparable. 

Edit: Might be a stupid question but what exactly is poppers? The poppers I know about are like the solvent things, like "Isopropyl nitrite". 




 Opium has been used for thousands of years, it should be socially acceptable as much as alcohol but of course it's not because of the propaganda that's been fed to us for the last 50-60 years. Alcohol is such a dirty drug as well (even compared to opiates) because it acts on so much receptors, obviously mainly NMDA and GABA, but there quite a lot of receptors it acts on directly and indirectly. 

I don't hope that alcohol comes out of "social acceptance". I just hope that other drugs can enter social acceptance as well.  




 I have a retarded habit of replying to people before reading the whole thing, sorry, I get what you mean now. They thing is though that you would have to spike someone constantly for months and months before they got psychosis.  




 You could make a medication up? I know this isn't based on real drugs but a lot of movies, books etc. do it. You could get a collection of what people are saying here and mix them all and make one up based on real stuff? Just a thought.  




 Psychosis isn't fun...  




 And not just alcohol poisoning, it can actually kill you when you attempt to stop after a long time of usage. 




 Fentanyl patches are kinda weird, they have hot spots. Basically one part of the patch can have WAAAAY more than the rest of the patch, and the other patch will have a different "hot spot" than the last. I would cut them up really small and stick them on or something, without a really beafy tolerance there's a pretty big risk of overdosing. Don't fuck about man, fent is around 100x (if not more) potent than morphine.  




 Alcohol withdrawals don't just make you feel like you're dying, they can actually kill you, it can also cause a form of dementia... I never understand why alcohol is considered socially acceptable.  




 They sure as hell never look normal even when they get their alcohol. Must be a shitty life when you're addicted to it.  




 Beer shots, lol...  




 I wonder why alcoholics sit up and drink all night all day everyday for months and months, kinda like my dad. Are they no longer euphoric or are they still euphoric? I don't get it.  




 Yo doc, I got this growth on my groin.

Anyway, Abilify is also an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor.  




 I feel your pain. I'm not on any benzos currently but I'm on a moderate dose of seroquel (after trying a few other anti psychotics) shit will make you feel like you're just a body with no brain or emotion.  




 Hell, there's been studies out there that say nicotine can just be as addictive as things like cocaine and certain opiates.  




 Whats wrong with being weird? Much better than boring.  




 How so? Can you explain at all? 




 Meth isn't a dirty drug chemically, it's just the way it's made in those random shitty clandestine "labs". It's used in America as a treatment for severe ADHD and possibly severe obesity (if nothing else has worked). The name for it is Desoxyn.  




 Some people don't know shit about drugs and/or brain chemistry, you shouldn't hate on them for not knowing that stuff but instead you should just try and educate them.  




 I've never really had a comedown from tramadol, maybe a bit of a headache and nausea but thats it, it's not a stimulant though, it's an opioid with SNRI activity.  




 They're really good if you've been constipated for days or you need to stay awake for something, or at a party. Other than that, it's such a waste of your day due to the comedown.  




 For me it's methylphenidate (ritalin) when snorted. That shit also made me look for some powder on the carpet, like a crack head.  




 He could be a chemist and he makes really pure coke. /u/ex-ALT can you make me some coke bro? 




 Ritalin (methylphenidate) is insanely euphoric, especially with alcohol but that comedown made me think I had a brain hemorrhage.  




 You should do it like cocaine, snort lines every hour... This may be flawed.  




 Try normal methylphenidate, that comedown made me feel like my head was gonna explode. Good drug though. 




 Do people still think that you can get rid of drugs? We've been taking substances for thousands and thousands of years. 




 This is so fucked up, holy shit. His mind was literally gone.  




 It's weird that heroin and morphine are a little different, mainly because heroin really only works because it breaks down into morphine.  




 You should get that checked out.  




 Plugging isn't always that great. If you haven't shat in a while then it'll just go into the shit and not work. 




 Yeah I totally love having to have to shit 10x a day and probably need surgery in the next few years on my GI tract... /s 




 I wish I had a routine, just going day by day now bro. 




 Opiates don't really cause organ damage long term, and if they do it's extremely rare. Everyone thinks that heroin, morphine etc. cause liver damage, but that's untrue. Cigarettes are worse than opiates because they have a lot of strong carcinogens in them, which WILL eventually cause some sort of cancer, maybe in 10 years or maybe in 40 years of smoking, but it will happen. Opiates can cause your immune system to weaken, but not to the point of something like AIDS or anything, just minorly fuck up your immune system. 

Also, they reason he said it should be legalized is because it would decrease the amount of OD's, yeah there will still be people who intentionally overdose or just overdose accidentally, but it would decrease. 




 If your T levels were negative you'd be dead.  




 Doesn't every knife say 1337 though?  




 I wouldn't say it's charity work. These are our "athletes" if you will, they should get payed even if they don't win, just like in any sport, and this is a good idea for it.  




 It's not exactly CSGO-L paying players, it's just that a % of the bets go to the players. It's a really good idea.  




 Needs to be more scottish.  




 AWP abstinence, huh? 




 I really think that DaZeD profited 10x more than any of them though. 




 dude that's racist.  




 I've been looking up a few virus pandemics and I've noticed that pandemics usually only last a few years, and come in big waves then die out within a few years, why is this? 




 He is obviously talking about sucking dicks for money. Stop jumping to conclusion guys. 




 I've not posted here in a while because I've been doing pretty okay, not great not bad, about a 6-7/10 though. But I do have one big problem that I can't get over and that's pretty bad memory loss, I'd say it's gone from mild to moderate pretty fast (a few months) I'm not sure if this is related to schizophrenia, meds or some other health problem (definitely not aging because I'm not old enough for dementia). I'm currently on 150-200mg of seroquel. I get confused pretty regularly, but not soo often, I've forgotten things I've literally JUST done about 2 seconds ago (confirmed by family members), I'm forgetting what to write right now actually, I just don't know really what's going on or happening, but yet I do, it's literally like things will just not hold up in my head, I do something forget it, do something else forget it, It feels like I'm forgetting everything. Someone will tell me to do something and I'll forget they ever even told me to do that a few mins later. 

The worst part though Is I just generally feel really confused and as if I'm forgetful in the moment about everything... Can anyone tell me why this is? Is it schizophrenia, med related? Or something else?

I feel it's a lot more than mild forgetfulness, I just know I'm forgetting things really bad because other people are telling me in the moment, and confusion is really bothering me, i feel like I just can't remember most shit. 

Anyone help?  




 Just wondering, what exactly was it that you done? 




 Oxymorphone has the worst bio orally, it's like 10%. At least hydromorphone is like 30%. 




 Because the law system is retarded and older than a dinosaur.  




 This is a competitive game. It's one of the biggest eSports titles. If we want to be taken seriously as a real sport there HAS to be rules/punishments and the tournaments aren't necessarily a gift, they're apart of the game because as I said, it's a big eSPORTS title.  




 I guess we're hating on DMG's now? 




 caseyfoster was also banned.  




 They won the pistol and NiP missed some critical AWP shots. Not because the map is balanced.  




 COBBLE COBBLE. 

This map should be copied into a USB and burned.
