 When people write about the phenomenon, they tend to focus on rocknroll, but a lot of Russian music that people had grown up with was also banned. Theres a Ukrainian singer called Pyotr Leshchenko  a Russian emigre who specialised in South American tango and gypsy music. After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately. You had popular Russian tunes that were classified as criminal songs, but they werent really. They were just regarded as low culture.

Title from information supplied by American Folklife Center staff. Title was formerly "Piegan Indian, Mountain Chief, having his voice recorded by ethnologist Frances Densmore," but American Folklife Center staff determined that the photo shows a playback horn on the cylinder recorder, so Mountain Chief and Densmore are listening rather than recording (12/2013).

 The tragic death of Ahmed al-Jumaili had nothing to do with Islamophobia.  Does Max Fisher do any research before publishing things?

Alia Salem added 2 new photos.

March 5 at 9:55pm  Dallas, TX  Edited  

Assalamu Alaikum

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

 The manta ray, which can be 25 feet (71/2 meters) across and weigh 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms), is the largest ray 









 Simply taken from another angle 




 How do they know it was a model?

The newspapers from 1933-34 write it was the actual fish, he just stuffed it and hung it up for exhibition.

 Arabs + nameless Delaware plates +  trespassing on multiple synagogue property's + taking pictures + acting suspicious =?

You are singling out one factor out of a big equation, which I never did.

  No real terrorist is going to arouse suspicion by walking around taking pictures of the outside of the building

I see you got the 'real' terrorists all figured out. One word, Mumbai (this is just one example off the top of my head).  




 For ten hours redditors were commenting on this post [without having a clue about the circumstances of this criminal event](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2yc4sv/nypd_steps_up_patrols_after_two_suspicious_men/cp8ng98), now I should be listening to you? 




 nothing they did was illegal

They drove illegally with nameless Delaware plates.  Typical, commenting without knowing the facts.
 




 And none of the redditors here knew they drove with nameless Delaware plates...  




 It's a active criminal investigation. The NYPD is looking for the individuals who drove illegally with nameless Delaware plates and acted suspiciously. I posted it in the hope that a good citizen will be able to help the NYPD identify them.   




 ISIS supposedly destroyed the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II.

Here's a link to what's in The British Museum from his Palace

 It was stuffed.

 There's no conclusive evidence that it's not real

 There's a difference between fear and caution. 
 




 I didn't make it, it was created by terrorists. 




 It was caught in 1933 so this photo is from 1933 and on. 




 Do you know more than the rest of us to be so sure?

No. I consider them suspicious, I am uncertain of their motive. You on the other hand claim they are above suspicion. 




 Do you think [this](http://imgur.com/9Mi05FH) is fake?

https://archive.org/stream/louisianaconserv29depa#page/4/mode/2up

It's  

so turgid, with the wings sticking out and the cephalic lobes all standing up like that 




 That's fine with me, I hope everything is OK by you. 




 The process of stuffing can also explain the rigidness. Why come up with new theory's?  

 




 I also dislike it.. 




 It seems from all the down-votes that they haven't. Some people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed. 









 Given what is going on in Europe and the Middle East, if this Arab had two functioning brain cells he'd know they should clear a synagogue visit ahead of time if they're just curious and don't want to raise suspicion. 

As for all the downvotes, sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed.

But the star of the exhibition is a local luminary - a 5,000-pound devil fish that proves New York's most amazing fish story.

A Giant Manta Devil Fish became entangled in the anchor rope of Captain A. L. Kahns fishing boat while he was angling just off the shore of New Jersey, almost capsizing the heavy boat.
A Coast Guard vessel came to the rescue, and killed the 5,000-pound monster Manta Birostris with 22 shots from a high-powered rifle. The sail-like fish has been mounted and placed on exhibition by Captain Kahn.
An 18-inch baby Manta was born shortly after the mother fish was dragged ashore. These huge rays are seldom seen, since they live in the deepest parts of the sea.

This signed photo postcard shows "THE GREAT MANTA" that was captured by Captain A.L. Kahn on August 26, 1933. The huge ray was reported to have weighed over 5,000 pounds and measured more than 20 feet across the wing. The critter was caught when it became fouled in the anchor line of the "MISS PENSACOLA II" and was unable to free itself. The ray was towed to Feuerbach and Hansen's Marina in Brielle, New Jersey where it was hoisted ashore with a travel lift.
