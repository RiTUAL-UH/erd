 The same thing happened to me on my birthday. I got multiple bottles of whiskey, whiskey glasses, whiskey stones for keeping it cool and apparently no one had discussed what to get me. 

Still unsure about the connoisseur vs. alcoholic part though.  




 I'm 32 and I never thought that I would wind up working with my dad, but here we are.  I'm now one of the partners in the business and doing very well. Sometimes following the family business can work to your advantage, but don't expect it to fall into your lap. As the son of the boss I have to work twice as hard as others but I'm also the best at my job and most likely to take over. Surprisingly, I really enjoy my work and my dad and I work well together.

I also never could have imagined getting married and having kids, especially since I was never really outgoing. It's highly recommended; best thing I ever did.  




 I don't know about bison, but with African buffalo the herd is all that matters. Often when one is injured and trying to follow the herd it will be cast out by the other buffalo and even attacked so that it won't draw predators towards the rest of the herd.  




 The Jackson family, all of them. They are trying so hard to cling to something, but come off looking like the most greedy and uncaring family ever. 




 Thanks for the reply! 




 I noticed from your photos that there were no charging stations in Canada.  I know there are none in my area, but did you find any along the way? Hopeful Canadian here.

 Customer: Hi; how much is your paint?

Clerk: Well sir, that depends on a lot of things.

Customer: Can you give me an approximate price?

Clerk: Our lowest price is our introductory special at $12 a gallon; after that we have dozens of different prices up to $199.

Customer: What is the difference in the quality of the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there is really no difference; its all exactly the same stuff.

Customer: Well, in that case Ill take your $12 paint.

Clerk: Well actually the $12 variety is only available to you on our website. If you want to buy it here at the store youll be charged an additional $20 Customer Convenience Fee.

Customer: So if I go home and get if off the website its only $12?

Clerk: That is correct, Sir--- plus a Credit Card Usage Fee of $6 and then of course there is the standard Shipping and Handling Fee of $14.

Customer: What?!! So, in other words, buying online would cost me exactly the same as what Id have to pay here in the store?

Clerk: I suppose so, but if you buy it here you get to use it immediately. Online purchases take ten business days to get to you, unless you pay the optional $24 Express My Paint fee.

Customer: You have got to be kidding me?!! Arent you?

Clerk: Well no, Sir; but that is academic anyway as right now the $12 paint is completely sold out in both places.

Customer: Thats BS! I am looking at shelves full or the stuff!

Clerk: Ah, but that does not mean that it is available for sale. We sell only a certain number of introductory priced cans on any given day. Oops, look at that! It just became available again at $17.50.

Customer: Cmon! You mean to say it went up while Im standing here?

Clerk: Fraid so. Inventory control changes our prices all the time. I strong urge you to purchase your paint as soon as possible as it could go up again. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe three gallons. No, make that four; I dont want to run out. I assume I can return
anything I dont open?

Clerk: Certainly, Sir. The $12 paint is non-refundable, but if you return it within 48 hours you will be entitled to a $4 credit towards the future purchase of another gallon of the same colour paint at the same or higher price.

Customer: That is crazy! In that case Ill just give any unopened can to my brother as hes planning to repaint his home soon.

Clerk: Sorry, Sir, no-can-do! Our terms and CAN-ditions- -- thats a little in-house paint joke--- prohibit paint transfer. It is strictly for the use of the original purchaser.

Customer: But wait a minute; I hadnt spotted those Paint Sale-$9.99* a Can signs over there. That sound like a much better deal.

Clerk: Ah yes, thats from our low cost paint division. That asterisk denoted that the cans are actually half
gallons and the price is based on a minimum purchase of two. There is also an additional Environmental Fee of $5 per can; a non-refundable Can Deposit of $3.50; a Paint Facility Charge of $5 and if you want more than one color, the second has a $25 surcharge and the third is $5 extra.

Customer: This is ridiculous; to hell with it. Ill buy what I need elsewhere.

Clerk: Well sir, you may be able to buy paint for some rooms from another store but you wont be able to find the paint for your connecting hall and stairway anywhere but here. And I should point out to you that if you want Uni-Directional paint it is priced at $249 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $199?

Clerk: Sir, that is only if you paint non-stop all the way around the room and back to the point at which you started. Stairways and hallways are considered unidirectional one way exceptions to the rule.

Customer: So, if I buy the $199 point and use it in my hallways and stairs what are you going to do about itsend some goons in to paint over it?

Clerk: Sir, I believe you are getting it now. But no, please, that would be plain silly. Wed simply charge you a Direction Adjustment Fee plus the difference to the $249 on your next purchase.

Customer: New Purchase?!! No way! I am out of here.

Clerk: We at Skyhigh Paints never forget that you have a choice, so thanks for shopping with us and have a nice day. Bye bye!

And aint that just exactly how it is these days?
