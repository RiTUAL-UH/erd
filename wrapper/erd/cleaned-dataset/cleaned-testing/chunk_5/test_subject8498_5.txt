 How Can Anime Be Real If Our Michelangelos Aren't Real 




 Shut up my mom said it does YOU GUYS ARE JUST JEALOUS THAT IM MICHELLE ANGELINA 




 Yo tambin, gracias 




 That was unexpectedly deep 




 Obvious troll is obvious 




 My new one did . It still does . 




 How Can Real Be Jesus If Our Jesus Jesus Jesus? 




 I bet gay people are gay. 




 I read your username and thought you were a novelty account that just wrote comments in caps lock, "shouting". I was disappointed. 




 As an argentinian I was in the verge of having a massive heart attack from beggining to ending. It was incredibly overwhelming. 




 Mayweather will earn 15 million USD per *round*. Jesus Christ. 




 u wot m8 




 Free here in Argentina! Come and watch here, we have nachos and beer. 




 Jesus Christ Marie, they're minerals 




 No, that's called being an awkward fuck. 




 Not with that attitude 




 It actually does. 78523 is the first "z", 96541 is the second one, and the rest is a square around the numpad. 




 That sucks, man, sorry to hear that. Did you try sending a ticket to R* Support?  




 Maybe put a system where in order to access the lobby to create those private servers you first need verification from Social Club?

Anyway, people **are** going to pirate the game and in the near future find the way or mod to play in multiplayer form, only not GTA Online, but a SAMP-like thing. 




 That's very impressive. 




 Meh, no worries. You tried to make it work. Props on you, buddy. 




 [Well, at least you're not an ass man](http://i.imgur.com/SjcXm2s.jpg)! 




 I can't believe I did this second try. I'm a bit drunk so I can't tell if it is awesome or shit. http://i.imgur.com/8gqKgWT.png


Edit: I'm an idiot. If you draw 3 points ANYWHERE it'll always make a perfect circle. 




 [And of course, for the ladies and gay men](http://i.imgur.com/FiAhtKQ.jpg)  




 Shut up, Brian 




 His username doesn't help him either 




 durr hurr repost hurr lol guyss what a reposter xDDD reposts suckss xDD

Just shut the fuck up with the "repost!" shit. This got ~5k upvotes for a reason, not all the people see the posts when first posted. I didn't for example, and I'm fairly sure the vast majority of those who upvoted it didn't also. 




 Hahaha god, I can't stop laughing. This sounds exactly like my luck. 




 Say something out loud now or you'll have a really shitty year.

*God I hope you're superstitious* 




 Omg, I need to show someone this now...  

*MOM!*

 




 The looks of it wrongly resembled to me like those pictures, and also the fact that they were 1 athom thick. It's really cool that I was wrong though! I would love to see those in person! 




 "This moment today, now, this that you are reading, will be a memory 50 years from now. It already is. You are already remembering this, and 50 years have passed. It's 2065 and this present once future will also become a past". 

It's not true now in 2015, but it will be sometime. And maybe you'll look back and remember this. It's crazy to think that today, tomorrow, and the next days will be a memory in your head. Time spares no one! 




 The moment you find out, it's just like you are waiting for him to pop out and say "ha! Gotcha! It was only a joke". It feels so surreal, so impossible. It doesn't seem logical. Alas, such is life, you truly never ever know when is your time. 




 This is taken by an electric microscope, right? What if we add "with the naked eye" to OP's question?

Edit: downvotes for asking a question? Way to go /r/askscience! 




 Yeah I did that too and fully regretted it as well, he's a cool dude.  




 Haha, calling someone gay on the internet. Classic. 




 Well, I suspected that too, because in spanish at least the option is called "risk your life", but I choose it anyways because fuck it, I believe it's worth fighting those fucking dudes before betraying your friends. Lore-wise I believe that's what Franklin would choose as well. 




 You're right.  

Isn't it perfect that it was voiced by Steven Ogg though? Like in, Steve-O?  









 You're right. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I mean, OP's complaining about a Reddit fanatic that spends every minute of his day here and describes a pretty unique and identificable work situation with lots of details... on Reddit. Yeah, I'm going on a limb and say this is a very fake TIFU. It's obvious that OP knows the *worst* thing he can do (unless he blatantly wants his coworker to find out that he's annoying him) is post it here, doesn't make much sense. 




 I understood it, and explained it earlier in a lower post. 




 Then come over to /r/thatHappened, we've even got $200% and $420% real legit stories! 




 Those two were rethorical questions. 




 This is why we have /r/thatHappened, to post ONLY legit $100% stories! 




 The fact that you can't properly contextualise analogies and believe that I'm saying Valve = a SO/person in absolutely every aspect just because I compared exageratedly to prove a point how bashing something you may like again in the future may not be the best choice and interpreted that as me being a fanboy shows me how delusional you are.

I believe that needed more commas, but well. Put a hip hop beat on the background and it'll read better. 




 Of course it is, that's why I also disagree with the "let's all hail the allmighty Valve". That's exactly why people went to the other extreme all of the sudden, because they were on one extreme to begin with.

If you love anything as obsessively as PCMR did with Valve and NEVER criticise any aspect or bad decision, of course it's going to blow up as soon as they make the first very bad move.

This is why this subreddit has NOT to go back again to love Valve as they were the cure for all known diseases. As you say, it's just a company. I still believe a great one, but a company nonetheless. 




 Very interesting read! Thanks for the link. 




 Can't we just point a super high concentrated laser beam (something like 50kw) so we can see with the naked eye the light that bounces back? 




 The only thing I disagree with was the bashing with "What has Valve done in the few years for us?" and mega-lists of "look at the reasons for how Valve has sucked in the last decade". Those are words you can't take back.  

I always felt that they were going to back out from this decision in the first week or two, that's why I didn't engage in bashing the company's name. It's like having a fight with your SO and start spreading that she/him is a shitty partner, that she's a liar, etc, to all of your friends, and then coming back with her after fixing things. The people who you complained to don't forget the things you've said.  

Now, they may be true but there was no need in pointing out lists of only bad choices Valve has done and upvoting them to heavens with x5 golds. My reaction was "where was all hatred this last week?", and now "where is all this hatred now?" It's what's wrong with going from loving something, hating it, and then loving it again.

EDIT: TIL: don't use overly exagerated analogies, Reddit likes to interpret things very literally and believes I see a game company as my soulmate. 




 Very well done! Now that I think about it, Trevor has a certain resemblance to Knoxville 




 I have not thought of this. Now I can not not think of this.  

Fuck, washing your hands with that soap, never again. 




 Every account on reddit is a bot except you. 




 Waits 3 weeks 




 Could it be possible in the near future that videocards come with vram slots? Imagine buying vram sticks 




 Dont worry, I laugh fully erect too all the time. 




 Yeah, that e: thing is not going to happen. 




 And therefore $100  




 Hey cousin, let's go bowling! 




 Buenisimo! Ah agrego. Hace mucho entraba muy seguido a 3dg y era bastante activo, por ah reconozco a un par. Mi user de ahi es Nikolai. (con punto al final) 




 If you sort it by top-all times, there's lot of great stories there.

Edit: /r/thingsididonambien it's a bit less popular but amazing stories as well 




 Fuck you in the ear, richardfrost2 




 That comment was "yeah, this guy is awesome... wait, that's a bit strange... Nah he's back being awesome! Wait... That's weird... Or is it awesome? Wtf, is he talking about cheeses? Oh I see... That's... awesome?" and so on 




 Agregado! 




 Tengo una pc medio pelo, Athlon x3 455, GTX 460 SE y 4GB DDR2, lo juego en 1080p con casi todo en mnimos, pero se ve bien igual y tira 40 - 50 fps 




 Dale, ya me un a un par! Mi SteamID es nikolai2154, el ID de Social Club Nikolaibk 




 Compralo! No s sobre otras plataformas, pero yo lo juego en PC desde que sali y anda 10 puntos, hubo varios parches en el medio, quiz eso tenga que ver. 




 Ahhh mir, no saba que se podan buscar las crews en Social Club! Genial, voy a buscar.

Me olvid de postear la plataforma, juego en PC! 




 Well, it does say 'black' lives... 




 Pregunto porque estara copado hacer una crew de argentinos, ciertas misiones requieren mucha coordinacin y con los yanquis a veces se me complica un toque el tema de hablar por mic, tengo una pronunciacin medio chota y de ltima estara copadsimo poder hablar en espaol y que todos entendamos bien. 




 My dick is crying 




 The folks over /r/pcmasterrace are going to *absolutely love* this. 




 Deep Throg 




 This community fucking rocks. You guys are awesome. 




 The desktop version also 




 I've payed for the game.  

I'm a photographer, I make money with Nikon products. Should I pay them a fee for every production I make? 




 Yes 




 Is it common for RAID 0 to break? 




 No. Not anymore. /3 




 For starters, I think Stiller did an excellent job and that he is an amazing actor. I just think maybe the movie would be (in my opinion and to my taste, that is) a little better if it would've been made in a more serious tone, with different casting.

For example, the role Seann Penn plays and how its portraited feels to me spot-on. I think he's a very serious, dark, and interesting character in a movie that has *some* silly-comedy bits, and would be better accompanied by a movie that goes along with that theme.  

All of that aside, I think it's an excellent movie. It made me cry, laugh, and it has that "Into the Wild" thing where you finish watching it and want to just go and ride a bike through the world. 




 I believe that kid is photoshopped there, although its a pretty weird picture even without the boy. 




 Triggered. 




 Instructions unclear, penis stuck in red paperclip 




 I watched it really high the first time, and couldn't believe what I was watching. The music and the photography are incredible. I cried in the part that plays that Bowie's song, in the bar, where he has to decide whether he goes to the chopper or not.  

Upon watching it a few more times I believe it's an amazing film but could've been better with better less comedy-like casting. I don't think Ben Stiller was the best choice for that part. 




 She very clearly told him at the beginning she wasn't interested in anything serious.   



500 days of summer helped me a lot to "forgive" my ex for dumping me. I was in a lot of anger towards her, she didn't cheat on me or anything like that as far as I know, but I was very angry still. After the day we broke up I didn't talk to her and I distanced myself completely as I knew it was for the best, but I was still very hurt.  


That film made me realize she hadn't done anything wrong. The relationship wasn't the same in a long time and she acted in behalf of her own well being and made the decision she thought was best at the moment, how can I blame her for that? Why should I blame a person for taking a decision that they thought makes them happier? If I think I own that right upon someone, the selfish one is me, not them. 

 




 Goddamnit Collin 




 Are you for real? 




 *hangs up* 




 Try me in 17985 years 




 (   )  




 Well fuck 




 I agree but I think it's mostly because there are two groups, the ones that desire to change the banner and the ones who doesn't give a fuck if they change it or not. 




 I don't see how anybody besides incredibly stupid people could be offended by that joke. It's a joke about misunderstanding the real meaning of the phrase "Jesus died for our sins so that we don't have to *(die for our sins)*". 




     /* Begin OH MAN */ 




 Queen is bad 




 Made up? Get your act together dude, this is /r/thatHappened. Mods check every story if it reaches the frontpage, of course this happened. 




 *Gotta do them all!* 




 Athlon x3, 4GB DDR2 and 460 SE here, the feels are being felt indeed :( 




 Thanks! It's really easy to make them,[ here's a tutorial](http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/little-planet-photos-5-simple-steps-to-making-panorama-worlds) 




 Great panoramas! 

I made some polar coordinates out of the 3 I liked more just for fun, they didn't turn out great because these aren't 360 panoramas but I think they look cool still haha http://imgur.com/a/1InQD

 




 *sound*

 




 You think wrong, I've never believed we were in the right to reclaim them, mainly because they have been occupied for about 190 years now, it doesn't make much sense. If you do some reading you'll find out that the war in 82 was only by and for the dictatorial government to remain in power longer, they actually never had the desire to regain the islands. 




 Wow, didn't even notice that haha. I'm beggining to think I spend way too much time in here, lol 




 Woosh 




 You were right!
