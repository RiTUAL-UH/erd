 I'm not going to be *that guy* and repeat it.

Basically, /u/IHaveAGloriousBeard, is wishing that it was easier to get housing in the game for the ability to have a space to be creative is what intrigues him about MMOs.

My guess is that they wish housing was cheaper than it is, or didin't require an obscene amount of time to get to the point that you can own housing in the game. 




 Out of context, it seems as though he isn't miserly but the fact is that he [around chapter 80-ish spoilers](/s "was given one million yen to get out of the mansion and get through the day because he saw Nagi changing.")

Given the money and the chance to, he would help those in need like he did. He still has the debt of 150 million yen. (~1.5 million dollars) 




 Nope. If you try the trial, you would still have to buy the game. (Which includes a 1 month subscription) 




 I used to think $15 a month was a lot but when you think about it, $15 is the same as going out to eat lunch once a month or three trips to Starbucks for a lot of hours of entertainment. 




 I don't see why not, it is the same as if I were to buy the collector's edition right now. Those 30 days are part of the cost of the game and it is no different than buying a month subscription.

So to get more out of it, try the trial and get up to 20 in as many classes as possible (or that you want) and then add the 1 month subscription. 




 Amagi Brilliant Park 




 I am not guaranteeing anything, but I saw that back when 2.3 dropped they had a free login weekend where anyone who had purchased the game in the past could play for free so they might have it for 2.5. 

PS: I am not affiliated with Square Enix so this is just speculation. 




 Seems as such, but you would have to make a new Square Enix account according to the restrictions here: http://support.na.square-enix.com/faqarticle.php?id=5382 la=1 kid=70929 ret=main (Also, you wouldn't have your progress from when you had the subscription since you are on a new account.)

One cool thing about FFXIV, that I have gleaned from the trial, is that one character can be all of the classes and they level/spec differently. (Even better is that you can share some abilities with other classes such as being an archer but using the archanist's physick for healing) 




 Yeah, all of those characters are from [August's visual novels.](https://vndb.org/p95)  




 Yep, you are right. They always thought that she was a guy because she never talked. 

I would imagine that the fantasia potion would allow what it allows now though. 




 If you have the game, try the free trial which allows you to play up to level 20 on each class and get a feel for it.

NOTE: If you have the retail copy DO NOT get the free trial through Steam for you would have to buy it through Steam to continue. 




 Something like fantasia would work for in the first episode of the first season one of the characters, Akatsuki, ~~is brought in as a male ninja but she is female~~ through the use of a potion similar to fantasia, she was able to change her appearance to her actual ~~gender and~~ stature.

Also, it is a really good show for MMO players as they use different mechanics such as the idea of cooldowns and effects and what not.  




 They could be on a mobile device. 




 Actually, like /u/EnduranceProtocol said, you can flair on mobile. You have to put []\(#request) in the beginning of the body of your post.

I have flaired it accordingly for you. 




 The app has always been free... 




 Sometimes I love reddit and the fact the people can have the exact same thought when faced with an image like this. 




 /r/anime has a really good wiki page about where to start with the Fate/___ Series. You can find the link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate#wiki_where_should_i_start.3F) 




 Personally, that would be even more confusing to people. While I get your point, it would be too "wordy" to fit as a flair and it would be a pain in the rear for mobile users to type it out. 




 Probably about $600-700 through various sites like the usual mTurk and PerkTV along with that M Ms promotion where I made about $150 from it. 




 No problem! I didn't mean to sound as harsh as I did. 




 [](#meta)

With the recent influx of posts with incorrect flair, I'd like to clarify the definitions of the various flair/tags.


##Which flair should I use?

Flair type | Description | Example 1 | Example 2
:--|:--|:--|:--
**Request** | Requesting anime based on information you provide | "Anime where the main character stops taking crap from the tsundere heroine and starts to dislike her?" | "I loved Mirai Nikki. Any suggestions?"
**Suggestion** | Suggesting anime to others | "Psycho-Pass is a 2012 show written by Urobochi Gen. It is a smart, dark sci-fi criminal story set in weird utopia/dystopia. The protagonist is a rookie cop on hunt for a serial killer." | "If you like Asimov, robotics, or Spielberg's A.I., watch Eve no Jikan"
**Manga/LN/VN** | Requests or suggestions specifically about manga, light novels, or visual novels | "Manga in which the characters go to the Moon and has some romance?" | "I enjoyed Katawa Shoujo, what other VNs would be good to play?"
**Identification **\* | Help identifying something (a gif, something from your memory, etc.) | "Help me ID an anime with man wrestling a deer." | "Anyone know what anime this GIF is from. It consists of a stylist who is working on a panda."
**Question** | General questions about a series| "In what order should I watch Ghost in the Shell?"| "Steins;Gate: English dubbed or subbed?"
**Meta** | Posts that discuss the subreddit itself| "Guide to tagging your post with flair"| "Just want to say it's nice to see the consistent suggestion posts and also want to welcome new frequent posters! Keep it up!"

\* When you submit an identification link, choose the `Identification ` flair. When someone answers your question, change it to `Identification ` so that users may know that your question has been solved.

---
To tag your post on mobile, you must have a special code **in the body of your post** when you submit.

Flair type | Code
:--|:--
[Request]|**[]\(#request)**
[Suggestion]|**[]\(#suggestion)**
[Manga/LN/VN]|**[]\(#manga)**
[Identification]|**[]\(#identification)**
[Question]|**[]\(#question)**
[Meta]|**[]\(#meta)** 




 You have the wrong flair. You are asking/***requesting*** show(s) for someone to watch.

I have changed it accordingly. Also **do not** put the flair in the title for it is redundant. 




 You had the wrong flair for you are asking/*requesting* shows, you need to use the "Request" flair.

I have changed it for you this time, but please remember to flair correctly in the future. 




 I'm really new to MMOs in general and I am trying the free trial. I see that if you don't buy the full version of the game within 90 days you lose your data.

If I do decide to upgrade, is there still a time limit for resubbing without losing your data/character(s)? (I'm asking because I am a college student and the semester starts soon. I might have more time over the summer to play which could warrant resubbing but I don't want to buy the game if there is still the possibility of losing my characters) 




 You could definitely make some money running those sites but you might want to look into selling the stories in example 1, linking to Amazon using an affiliate link in #2 and just having a good site in #3 to improve your income.

I, personally, make some money using adsense on my youtube channel but it isn't much. (That is also my fault for not growing/establishing an identity and not really editing my videos)

I cannot go into, minute, detail about my earnings but I have been paid twice.

You need to earn $100 in your adsense account before you cash out. You can set the type of ads that you want on each site individually. (I think... It has been awhile since I checked my account) 




 Thanks for doing this and your work throughout the season! 




 Most of the time when a show in announced at the end of a season, there is a one season gap between the announcement and when it airs. (ie. It was announced at the end of the Fall season so there is a high chance that it will air in the Spring) 




 I was shocked to see someone doing one of the characters from Payday. (The video game) 




 I have removed your post for there is a multitude of unmarked spoilers. 

Please read rule #3:

 Use spoiler codes (see below) and no spoilers in titles. If revealing spoilers is crucial to your post, do so in the body. We reserve the right to ban you if you do not follow this rule.
 




 In the future, you might want to make the post like you did but also, send a link to the moderators to the post so that we can definitely see it. 

I, personally, only check in on the subreddit once or twice a day and this would make it easier for the moderators to see and discuss the post.

I have gone ahead and done so there isn't a need to do so for this one.

---
I know I have double commented on the same post, but I didn't want to distinguish the other one since it was my own thoughts. 




 Personally, and this is just my opinion without asking any of other mods, I think that it should be under "Question" but I can see the need for this sort of flair. (This would have to be up to the mods as a collective to think of how to do it and, more importantly, how to add it to the CSS along with the mobile tagging system) 




 For some clarification, and this is how I think of it:

* **Request** is used when you are *asking* for a show.

* **Suggestion** is used when you are *giving* show(s) for people to watch. 




 Good luck, Reddit disapproves and could possibly shadowban you for continual self-promotion. 




 Something something /r/nocontext  




 You could always install a bidet in your toilet. Let it run for ~30-40 seconds and you should be good to go. 




 Unless you use a site that unshortens the link you have no idea where that link is going which creates a larger risk for malware and drive-by downloads.

There is also the fact that a lot of those link shortening sites are used to serve people ads and the person who posts the link gets a cut of the money. 




 It is going to be packed:

* F/SN UBW continuation

* Knights of Sidonia S2

* Yahari S2

* HS DxD S3 (If you are into that sort of thing)

* Shokugeki no Soma

* Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo

* Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (Haruhi spin-off with the original voice cast)

* Nisekoi S2

* Hibike! Euphonium (KyoAni's new show. [Here is the PV for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6B320TbJk))

* Hello! Kiniro Mosaic

* Gintama (S# whatever they are on now) 




 The new KyoAni show along with The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. (The new Haruhi spin-off anime) 




 Someone needs to make the "It's raining men" part a full AMV. 




 You might want to provide a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker profile/list so that people can get an idea of what you are looking for.

While it is a lot more light-hearted, you might want to try some anime in the "game" genre such as [Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo) or [No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life). 




 OP, you were requesting (asking for) shows not suggesting (giving) shows to watch.

I have changed your flair accordingly, but please try to select the appropriate one in the future. 




 Actually this shouldn't be "Suggestion" but "Request" for OP is asking for shows that are similar to ____. 




 Put that $50 towards your PC build. 




 [Osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh) is the first one that came to mind. The game is updated at least once a week with new features and bugfixes. What is really impressive is that the game is free, and there is only one guy working on it. 

It was first released on September 17, 2007 and the updates have been continual since then. 




 Now I'm sad... I wonder how it will go from here.

Some speculations and thoughts on how it might progress: 

* See how people react to her (Possibly the run in with her actual parents)

* Have the MC grow to love her

* Repercussions due to time travel

* Find a way to avoid the MC's death

* Any/all of the above 




 Thanks for doing this OP. 




 Sorry, all I did was reiterate what the [Steam page says.](https://i.imgur.com/30Cyqcm.png)

I've only ever played it on the PS3 when I got it through PS+. 




 Don't see why not. You might want to use some software to make the PS4 controller seem like a Xbox 360 one for minimal configuration. 




 You probably could. I was playing dolphin, the emulator, yesterday using my gamecube controller and the WiiU gamecube adapter and windows fews it as a normal controller. 




 I've heard good things about *Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons* and for $1.49 you can't go wrong. You WILL need a controller since the mechanic is that one analog stick is assigned to only one brother and the other one to the other brother.

Another recommendation that I have for people would be *Kerbal Space Program*. While it is in early access, the developers have been updating it for the past two years and the community has really grown by leaps and bounds so it would be worth it to get it now. 




 I got:

* Nikon D7100

* AF-S DX NIKKOR
18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II Lens

* AF-S DX NIKKOR
55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR Lens

* A carrying case

* 32 and 64GB SD card for said camera.

I am really looking forward to learning about and using this camera. 




 Just don't invite Mr. Nook. 




 The series is "[Domestic na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/manga.php?id=70941)". The current translator said that he/she would do it up through the third volume of the series. There are 30+ chapters out in Japanese and in English we are up to 11. 




 If you want work, stick around /r/manga for groups are always looking for new translators. I know of a series that the subreddit is really liking that will be losing its translator soon so you might be able to step in.  




 It is too early to sleep but I had to go up anyways so that "santa" (ie. My parents) could set up for Christmas. It happens every year, so I am used to it. 




 Could the guy been of asian descent? I know in Japanese, America is written as  which is "a-me-ri-ka" since they do not have a "ca" syllable. That could explain the hard consonant at the end. 




 Heck, you could loop the first ten or so seconds and it would seem to be a normal ringtone. 




 I have removed your post for you are looking for hentai and other NSFW content. This is against rule #4 of this subreddit. I don't make the rules, just enforce them.

You might want to look at getting/playing Nekopara which is coming out on the 30th on Steam (as an all ages version) or the 18+ version which will be released elsewhere online.

 




 As a heads up, you will want to remember to flair your post with the appropriate flair. Since I am able to, I went ahead and did so.

You may also want to link to a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker/list site with what you have seen and liked.

 If the letter was sent in the US, you ought to check the ink stamped over the, well, stamp. That will show you which post office the sender used to send the letter. 




 There is also the Uncharted series. 




 Yeah, but wouldn't it make more sense to release it as a free app with ads so that a lot more people would download it within that period of time? 




 I'd get it, but it seems as though the app has ads even though it is a paid application. To me that is really annoying and if the general idea is that if you pay, you don't have ads. 




 Something something "Don't do it."

Followed by a post about how that in of itself is turning into a meme.

With that followed by a post with a copy/paste of that story/paragraph/run-on sentence. 




 Something something "one of us".

Still, I welcome his reviews and insight into the media. 




 There is also Nekopara, which is coming out on the 30th, that is pretty much the definition of "Moe". 




 No problem! I went to read the introduction and I saw it. I figured it got past the spell check since it was spelled correctly but it was the wrong word. 




 One thing you might want to fix in your introduction is that you have "right" when you meant "write". 




 If it is part of a daily/flash deal during the main sales, it will not go lower. If it isn't low enough for you, wait until the spring or summer sales. 




 I've been interested in Guild Wars 2 as an MMO since there isn't a need for a subscription but it doesn't seem to be bogged down by a pay to win cash shop like the "free"-to-play MMO's that are out there.

Part of my renewed interest in the game is that it is, currently, on sale over at Amazon and I was given a gift card for there and I could download it. Another part is due to watching Log Horizon which is the story of seasoned MMO players getting stuck in the MMO and their adaption, and the viewer's subsequent introduction, to the world which looks and operates much like an MMO. (It is actually a pretty good watch too, but I digress.)

A few questions I have:

* How is it holding up? (I know it came out a few years ago)

* How friendly is it to a new player? (This not only be how the game is for new folk, but also the reaction of the community to someone who is new)

* How big/organized are the quests/raids?

* What do you think of it?
 




 If you want to see how someone made it into an actual sword replete with a live blade, [Man at Arms did a video about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obw19lRWO-Y) 




 Man, I hope the person who is doing Daitoshokan is able to keep up the pace. (They are translating ~3% every week! By extrapolation, the TL could be done around the middle of June.) 




 At least the other passengers could watch the movie, *Gone With the Wind*. 




 No problem!

It opens with the girls in a sauna replete with nudity and such. 




 WARNING: The first half of the chapter is NSFW! 




 I think the original *To Love-Ru* ran in Shounen Jump, so I imagine they can. 




 For those of you who are confused, here is the TV Tropes link with a description and examples of "tsundere". 

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere
 




 What sucks is that there are maps that, basically, require the player to have a drawing pad/tablet to complete. (You are talking 1000+ pixel "jumps", which is the space between single notes. That is next to impossible to do with a mouse.)

As someone who plays with a mouse it is really annoying to have that type of map on an otherwise good song. 




 I'm not the person you responded to, but to find out:

1. Ask how early/late you were

2. Go back 9 months.

3. Apply how late/early you were

4. Now you know. 




 For those trying to find the link since it wasn't a featured article, here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_list/December_2014

Scroll down to December 19th. 




 How about submitting from a mobile device? If you are in an app or something like that you don't see it. 




 You'll have to find that on your own as you would, most likely, be downloading it illegally. 




 I've heard that it doesn't hold any punches in its content. 




 You might also want to read the mangaka's new work *Domestic na Kanojo* which is being translated at a pretty quick rate for the time being. 




 I can attest that restrictions on creativity can help spur it. I'm the type of person that can be creative but within a box (restrictions/ideas). Without it, I am useless. 




 Status update:

I was unable to save the Kerbal as the craft had mysteriously vanished. I have, however, managed to [land on the Mun twice](https://i.imgur.com/q9KGMWk.jpg) and [launch a working satellite.](https://i.imgur.com/lD70NLS.jpg)This is the beginning of the end of my free time. 




 You might also want to wait/try Nekopara. I've read the demo/trial and it seems to be a fun and light-hearted story. The main game comes out on December 30th. 




 Good grief. 




 Sorry, they went out of business a few years ago. 




 You can't when another program minimizes the screen for you without any warning or consent. 




 I was time warping to get a maneuver and I had the speed up pretty high (~1000x since I had a day-ish to skip) and all of a sudden ASUS WebStorage decides to tell me that I need to update by minimizing any fullscreen windows.

I was really annoyed as it took me awhile to find a maneuver that did what I needed on that mission and I didn't have an autosave that was recent.

I really wish there was a way to have the game pause when it is minimized. 




 My main issue with your comment is that you replied rejecting the recommendation that someone gave you. That, in of itself, is against the spirit and idea of this subreddit. There are many on here that would be more than willing to suggest things to people, but if the requester is going to reply back saying something along the lines of "This suggestion sucks" what do you think the suggester would think? It doesn't stop with that requester, what if there was a user who was visiting this subreddit for the first time, or wanted some interesting romance anime, saw this reply at the top?

"If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything." (ie. If you don't like a recommendation you are not obligated to reply.) 




 Like I said, screenshots won't do this series justice but if you want to be hard-headed so be it, but do not ridicule someone for their suggestion.

This sort of thing could undermine the purpose of this subreddit.

/u/FoleyX90, don't be discouraged from suggesting anime.

 




 For clarification purposes:

* The "x" is for unsolved identification posts
* The "check" is for solved identification posts. 




 I don't think Yuushibu would be a good thing for a 10-year old, let alone a girl. 




 Remember the phrase "Never judge a book by its cover."? Well, this definitely applies to White Album 2. Just give the first three episodes a try. 

There is a reason that it is highly rated. 




 Thanks for reminding people to flair their posts.  




 Thanks. It all made sense. I was using the retrograde marker but I was being lazy and had it on the new autopilot system. The main issue I had when landing was that the prograde and retrograde markers would flip when it changed from down to up and vicecersa. 




 Thanks.

I'll try that in the morning and let you know how it goes.

Do you happen to know of any way to prevent that from happening? 




 Yeah, I know people have done it before but it took me about 8-9 tries. For the last three times, I kept on forgetting important stuff like landing struts or a ladder.

What isn't pictured is the time I missed the Mun, the time I crashed right into it, the time where I didn't give enough time to decelerate, and the time where I ended up in an orbit around the Mun.

I just got back into KSP last night and now that my finals are over, I'll try to do more and more complicated stuff. 

EDIT: This was done in the new update. 









 Thing is, if /u/The_Dvls_Advocate really wanted to represent themselves as speaking officially, she would have clicked the "distinguish" button under her comment. That changes it from the normal to the green background that mods have.

Source: I am a mod on a few subs and every so often I have to "speak officially" which requires that button/link. 




 Considering that Sekai Project has the rights to publish Nekopara in English and this "startup" company that no one has heard of now has the rights to the 18+ version in English, one could put two and two together to realize that Denpa is a subsidary of Sekai. 




 I really need to play/read MuvLuv... 




 The hype is real. 

I'm definitely looking forward to the new user interface for building stuff as it is hard to sift through pages of objects to find the one you want. 




 Try placing a bid on a game that is less than 10000 gems. It will keep a record of your bid and will hold it for you so that as the auction goes on, where the top bidder gets it every 45 minutes, you could have a bid that wins. 




 Oh, okay. I haven't spent any time messing around with the car colors so I just listed some numbers to show what I was looking for. 

I guess what I was asking/wanting is a way for the game to take the insane colors and find the closest substitute out of the normal range.

 




 I recently played a workshop map and when I finished I got the "Diamond Medal" but looking at the time compared to the gold, silver, bronze, I should have got bronze.

[Here are two screenshots that show what I am talking about.](https://imgur.com/a/iFBwg#0)

~~Does anyone know anything about this?~~ Also, why didn't I get the bronze medal?


**EDIT: Spoke with /u/Fork-H on Steam and it seems as though it is for beating the author's time.** 




 Yeah, it could be a simple checkbox in the options screen to normalize the colors which allow it for those who want it but remove it for those who don't. 




 I recently played online for the first time and one of the players had a negative color on their car which made it really hard to see them or even see past them while playing.

I was wondering if there was a way for force negative colors to be inverted again. (ie. If the color is (-200,-30,-60) then it will be (200,30,60)) 




 WARNING: The "second season" of Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, has some elements that would make it awkward to watch between siblings. (Look up the "Toothbrush scene".) Bakemonogatari is fine, but it would make it hard to continue the series. 




 It seems as though DenpaSoft is going to be Sekai Project's 18+ publishing name. Odds are they are doing it due to the connotations of a company being on certain sites and having 18+ content for sale elsewhere. 




 While it is early access, this isn't the developer's first game with these mechanics. Distance is, basically, a super polished and improved version of [Nitronic Rush](http://nitronic-rush.com/) which was, originally, a college project that was released online for people to download and play for free. 




 I got my last assignment done that I had to do before finals start on Friday. Now I just have to wait for the iterations of the program to finish. (It is just a matter of waiting so I don't count it as work.) 




 This is really nice of you! 




 It isn't weird, just a lazy programmer who forgot about timezones. I guess they figured that only people in Japan would access or care about this countdown. 




 If you read the top comments, the javascript used for the countdown bases itself on the user's current time, not the actual time in the world that it is supposed to end at. 




 Sorry, I don't download manga so I can't help you here. I know there are apps out there for those who want to side load manga to read. 




 I didn't either. The only reason I found out is that I went to Japan for two weeks and I wanted to read manga during the evening when I back at the ryokan. For some reason it showed all of the manga on Batoto. (In Japan of all places) 




 The reason why you feel as though the amount of manga is limited is that the developer has to censor certain titles if you are in the US. (The best way to get around this is to use a VPN that allows you to set your "country" as Japan. All you have to do now is reset the catalog in the app. Once that is done you can turn off and remove the VPN if you want to.) 




 TL Note: Keikaku means plan. 




 I wouldn't say that. The vast majority of Nintendo's titles this generation on the WiiU have all been at 60 FPS.
