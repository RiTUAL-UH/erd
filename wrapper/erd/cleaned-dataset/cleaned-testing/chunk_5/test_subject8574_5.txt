 You know what makes me feel better? Not this. Maybe I can imagine it as a sleepover, but fuck it is hard too.  




 Cozy? 




 I don't know whats cooler, this story, or the fact that death has a Reddit account. 




 This is special.  




 Thank you so much! :] 




 Can you feel it? Your thoughts draining from you. There is a slit in your head and everything is starting to leak out and float away. You start to feel all that imagination and those genius ideas of yours become harder to pin point in your head. You just start zoning out instead of thinking about the most interesting things. Actions that were never executed due to the lack of the ideas and thoughts that your imagination spawned in that little head of yours. I cuss and swear but it's all pointless in the end. I go through life everyday losing more and more of what I had. I'm defeated.

I even start to notice that I don't look with my eye's anymore. I don't really see, it's more of a daily grind of usual events that never seem to change guiding me to where I'm supposed to go. It's as if someone is grabbing my hand and pulling me where to go next while I just stare blankly into the ground. I'm lifeless, and my thoughts are leaking. Who I am is leaving me, but somehow I'm still here. My consciousness is rolled up into a fetal position inside my head as it's stripped of everything. I am merely a viewer now, but I just want to leave you with one last thought before I depart.

Who's pulling the strings when we become thoughtless, what guides us, and who or what happened to my head. I mean, you don't just start losing your thoughts by yourself, do you? Is it that I need something to blame all this on or is it just me? I don't know if I should feel scared, angry, or just plain concerned. Something Inside is telling me to just loosen my grip and submit. Something wants me to let go, and you know I could just let go, but I won't.

How could I let go of all this, my thoughts, feelings, memories. As I slowly lose my grip and fade to black, I see that little bit that I have left. I don't want to leave all that behind, because that made me happy when I felt bleak. Just giving up to this dark void? Fuck that. No. I refuse.

I will fight till I die inside. Sure, you can scoop everything I love and hold dear out of my head and just leave me to become a husk, but I am for damn sure not letting you do that easily. I will fight you, whatever you are, and grip as tight as I can to all those amazing child hood dreams and memories that made me smile and laugh. Fuck letting all of that just fade away and fuck you. You will win and I will lose in the end. But, I will love, I will smile, I will look back on those times I had done both, and I will remember. I will remember what it was like to live.

I will live until I die, and I will remember as much as I can before I float away. 




 It's good to know that things are good :]
