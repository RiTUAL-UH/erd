 Two of this guys posts have made it to the font page, and both of them I saw on Facebook a week ago... 




 Ok thanks so much. How long have you been riding for? 




 i live in North Vancouver. i would do my riding here http://www.bikepirate.com/dh-trails/mount-fromme/. i have ridden here before with my norco (bigfoot? haha i forget exactly which model) but that bike got stolen. 




 Also, i would use the bike for general use(but mainly for mountain biking). 




 Thanks for the help. i am looking to do some trail riding, as you can tell im  not all that experienced ( with types of biking, i am confident on a bike). which bike would you suggest for trail riding?
