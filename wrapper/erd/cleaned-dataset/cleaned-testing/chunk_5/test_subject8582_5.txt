 One thing that was always noticeable in the Rebuilds is their relatively "Baby's First Mindfuck" approach to what was originally one of the heaviest mindfucks out there. Because of this, they're very easy to watch (even 3.33 if you aren't *really* watching).  









 Looks like Mothra is joining [Godzilla's Nike sponsorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oCF-QFuoYs).

 All joking aside, this is a serious issue. I don't want anyone thinking that I support this, so here's my disclaimer:

I do **not** support Minecraft profile pictures in any way. Just like anime profile pictures, they are for pathetic loser trash. Just stop.  









 If you don't know who Samus is, that implies:

A: you've never played any of the Metroid games, which are kind of a staple in most of Nintendo's lineups

B: you've never played Smash Bros, clearly showing you really *don't* give a shit about games

C: you've never been part of any real discussion on games, particularly Nintendo games. Certainly not enough to complain about them.

 I want to imagine Unit-01 combined with the WUNDER to create arc-Unit-01. Then it turns out the black moon is actually a gigantic AT field battleship, so arc-01 fuses with that to become Super Galaxy Unit-01. Then after escaping the instrumentality, they become Tengan Toppa Evangelion Unit-01 out of sheer AT field power.

 In many games, I seem to take my opponent to 100+ percent, but I feel like I should be getting kills way lower than that. I usually juggle them with my Utilt/Uair or rely on smashes, but that doesn't seem to be doing the trick.  




 It's kinda like a failed version of "song" 




 Anno *says* it's all meaningless, but can you really trust the guy who made the insanity of End of Evangelion?

 After Nia turned into the Antispiral, said "hi my name is Antispiral time to fuck yo shit up", and fucked yo shit up, everyone immediately demanded that Simon be held accountable. Why did no one realize that the Antispiral were the ones responsible? Particularly the rational people like Rossiu, who sentenced Simon to death for what the Antispiral did.  




 Minus any interference from Kamui, Goku Uniforms, or any form of armor, how would that fight turn out? Gamagoori seems like he'd be strong enough with his own size-changing powers to beat Ryuko without Senketsu, but on the other hand, Ryuko is still a force to be reckoned with. 

Neither gets any equipment.

 If one were to take all the magical girls, from Madoka Kaname to Sailor Moon, and average them out, that would be the first fighter. Keep in mind that the *most* powerful magical girl is probably Madoka, as she became God. 

1: how powerful is this average magical girl? Who can she beat?

If one did the same things for mechas, from the glorified forklift from Aliens up to Super Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann (and the Infinity Jeager) that would be fighter number two. 

2: how powerful is this mech? What can it beat? Who is its pilot?

3: the two do battle. Who wins? At what cost?

4: Both are competing for the same time slot on Toonami. Who wins?

 It's the silliest thing we all noticed the second or third time through Back to the Future. The timeline takes a whole week to catch up to Marty after he almost makes his parents not get hitched. This even seems to contrast the other two movies and how time acts there. But it actually doesn't work this way. 

The indicator (the photo in the first movie) is not actually displaying not the future Marty comes from as he changes it, but rather the possibilities of how each subsequent timeline changes the photo. By screwing up his parents meeting, he creates an infinite number of timelines, each of which has a different string of events following the accident. As time goes on, many of these events are narrowed out because that's how time works. Once those are gone, the timelines resulting in his parents not getting married become more and more likely until (at the Dance) Marty's existence becomes so unlikely that he wouldn't be able to save them in any way if it weren't for the fact that he *knew*. So the indicator is the only reason the chance wasn't straight-up zero, and how he was able to create one of the only sequences of events leading to his birth.  




 One of my favorite kaiju. He definitely needs to make a comeback somehow!

 It's gotta be one of the Pokemon games. Particularly Pearl, Platinum, or Soul Silver, since when I was younger (second or third grade when Pearl came out) I didn't have a whole lot of games. To this day, I consider the core Pokemon games the best game series of all time, since all of them are least an 8/10 for me. Over all the games, I can't imagine I've clocked less than 1000 hours.  




 No, not really. It's a similar sort of surrealist imagery centering on one woman. The only thing it really has in common with End of Evangelion is the non-pelvic vagina, which isn't really reminiscent of EoE in particular.  




 It implies this happens after some scenario of End of Evangelion. 

HOLD UP. This actually just occurred to me as I write this, but what if that is the outline of an Eva that went down fighting and securing Tunniel. According to people on this sub, Tunniel appeared in the fifteen years after Second Impact replacing Sachiel as the harbinger of the Angels' return. So if Tunniel had to be captured, what if Unit-00, Null, or Rei in 01 managed to take down Tunniel 




 Things got too real ;-;

 I don't know where in Jersey you are, so I can't give specific recommendations, but my general advice is this: 

Try and find a small pizza shop in town owned by an Italian-American couple (preferably named Joseph and Marie, but that's entirely optional). Big-name pizza places like Domino's and Papa John's are usually pretty bad, at least by Jersey standards. New Jersey (as well as NYC and a little bit North into Connecticut) has a near-endless supply of local restaurants who know how to make pizza right. Walking around in town for a bit should yield results.  




 Such an underrated kaiju. It's a shame he came right after Mechagodzilla and Biollante, because if it weren't for that he probably would have been received better.  




 Depends on where in Jersey you live. Plenty of responses here have some good NJ pizza, but my general advice is either to use Yelp (or some equivalent) or to find a small, non-chain pizza place by just walking around. Chances are you'll find a good thin-crust pizza with that method. 

If you live in or around Princeton, I can personally recommend Conte's and Pizza Star. For Mercerville, I would say DiLorenzo's.  




 It sure is a good thing I live right down the street from there. 

*So* good.  









 Pretty sure his accent is just a New York accent, maybe North Jersey.  




 Then why not call it a REDEMPTION ring?

 I haven't seen the new one. Is she ant different than the Annie I remember, aside from maybe fitting the "Dark Knight" a bit better? 




 I just looked up the colors and she could have an entire hand covered in lantern rings. She'd fit with green, blue, indigo, and violet.  




 Don't forget Annie's strongest asset: her undying optimism and willpower. It only just occurred to me, but if Bruce is in the Justice League, there's a good chance he could hook her up with a Lantern ring.

 Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same? 

Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction. 

Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.

Her down-b is witch time, which works as a counter, but rather than just countering the attack she instead gains witch time proportional to the attack strength she is hit with. She then slows down time for everyone else but can move freely.

 In 2.22, Tunniel is the Third Angel, meaning it arrived before Sachiel. It presumably arrived at the same time as Adams and Lilith, considering Sachiel was still the first angel to arrive for 15 years. And its designation is the *third* angel, meaning it is in fact separate from the Adams and Lilith. And SEELE, holders of the Dead Sea Scrolls, have also confirmed it to be the Third. Both of the Angels who showed up around Second Impact were seeds of life, so if Tunniel showed up around that time as well, that means there's a good chance we're missing a whole other seed of life. It could also explain where the Spear of Cassius/other Longinus came from since Lilith lost hers in First Impact.
