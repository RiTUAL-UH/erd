 I like you. I like the kindness of your comments and responses. And I like your willingness to produce content that is helpful to others. Keep it up. You've made a new fan. 




 I'm thinking the [Minimus 20v3 Cross-Training](http://www.newbalance.com/Minimus-20v3-Cross-Training/MX20-V3,default,pd.html). Acceptable? 




 I know this isn't /r/fitness, but I'd like your opinion on the [Minimus 20v3 Cross-Training shoes](http://www.newbalance.com/Minimus-20v3-Cross-Training/MX20-V3,default,pd.html?dwvar_MX20-V3_color=Blue_with_Silver_and_Yellow start=4 cgid=167000) for regular gym/weight lifting/light-to-medium running shoes. 

I've been searching for a good and good-looking shoe for working out. Help a brother out. 




 Looking to spend no more than $75. 




 Looking for a pair of semi-fashionable athletic shoes. Light running. Heavy gym. To wear with gym shorts and sweats. Suggestions?  




 Thanks for your input. That was a really nice comment.  




 Check the blogs. Black circle is so SS14. 




 What shows you that it is a fake? And who would bother making a fake Ralph Lauren?

[Wearing it.](http://i.imgur.com/0IvoAOa.jpg?1)

[Side pockets. Check out that sleeve billow.](http://i.imgur.com/hpHHd7c.jpg?1)


I am wearing it today. I don't know if I should be. It definitely isn't your typical slim-fitting button down. Wife copped it at a thrift store and we both find it interesting. 

Is it fine as is? Should I wear it as a jacket in the future? Should I toss it out and never wear it again? Thoughts? 




 This guide contains some great information, the only thing is every single bit of it can already be found linked in the sidebar.  




 Get a girlfriend and/or a wife. Stuff your stuff in her purse. Brilliant.  




 Care to elaborate how they easy to make yourself?  




 I've read the important posts on pocket squares. I am not one to spend $40 on a small piece of fashionable cloth. 

What are some good places to shop for stylish (and affordable) pocket squares?  




 My wife and I just finished playing through Bioshock Infinite. She took pictures of our bunny today and sent me this makeshift meme:

 I feel so uneducated. I cannot understand the lingo. I've Googled it all and it hasn't helped. All I'm trying to determine is whether or not my Roth IRA mutual fund is a good (read: successful) one. 

**VGSTX (Vanguard STAR Fund)**

You can give me a yes or no, but please explain what numbers I can look at/for to determine if a fund is good or not. I want the answer, but I also want to learn.

P. S. Please be nice. I've been contributing to this fund for almost 10 years now so it'd be heartbreaking to discover it sucks... 




 I am currently able to incorporate each of these shoes into my wardrobe. That, however, does not mean that they are the right/perfect shoes to compliment my attire. I am hoping to get some guidance on how to weed out some shoes and replace them with others. That's the point of this thread. 




 Here are the shoes I have. What shoes do I need (or need to get rid of) for a comprehensive wardrobe?

 This is kind of an ignorant and generalized post.

Let's not ignore Scripture, please.   

**Proverbs 22:6 - "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."**

Furthermore, there are efficient ways to teach children the principles of Scripture and the Person of Scripture, as there are inefficient ways to teach them. There have been a lot of poor tactics that have been historically used, but that does not mean that we throw out the practice altogether. 

We applaud teaching children how to read, write, practice good hygiene, and play sports. How silly would it be if we failed to teach them the single thing that matters most? 




 [**TagPro Profile**](http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/profile/5349fdcc7e7269a515e60426) and [**TagPro Stats**](http://tagpro-stats.com/profile.php?userid=26728)

Over the last few days I played 101 games on a new account. I wish I could have done 100, but if I understand correctly, you have to play over 100 games for your stats to register fully.

For my first attempt, I came out with a pretty solid Win % (75.25). But, as far as I could tell, everything else is pretty gross. ^^Although ^^I ^^don't ^^know ^^how ^^to ^^properly ^^tell ^^good ^^stats ^^from ^^bad ^^stats.

A few stats for those that are too lazy to click links:

___
* **Games:** 101
* **Wins:** 76
* **Losses:** 22
* **Disconnects:** 3

___
* **Tags/Game:** 6.020
* **Returns/Game:** 4.634
* **Prevent/Game:** 33.000
* **Support/Game:** 5.604

___

I played defense as much as possible. I'm clearly not that great as an attacker. Anyways...

Thoughts? Comments? Is this any kind of accurate depiction of a player's abilities? Did I really have to play through ten thousand Rabbit games in fear of receiving a disconnect upon leaving? Halp. 




 nice encouragement.  




 I was in this game and I think Raven513 (spelling?) abused his ~~mom~~ mod powers...  









 I upvoted your comment but that wasn't enough to express how highly I think of you and your comment. My favorite. Great jorb. 




 I don't know, I happen to think **Juke Juice** might be beneficial. I'm trying to think through all the nuances of such a power. I'd imagine that my instincts and reactions would be quicker. I'd be able to dodge better, jump quicker, and respond speedily, not only run faster. 




 * **JUKE JUICE** would not help you run faster, but would allow you to get to your top speed very quickly. I guess this would not only be the truth when it comes to running, but when it comes to any sort of movement.

* **ROLLING BOMB** would fill you with "unstable energy", allowing you to unleash said energy on command. When turned on, it would also allow you a single-use invulnerability. 

* **TAG PRO** would grant you the power of death, causing the things you touch to quickly wither away to nothing. 

Which would be most interesting to have IRL?
 




  Hello my name is staer, and this is Rorro, we are calling on you and your neighbors to take part in an interesting online game called TagPro. We are wondering if you'd be interested in taking the next step. [Wait for rejection, thank them, and go to the next door.]
 




 Some taggers have multiple players in their home (or one player with multiple accounts). I have found it somewhat difficult to switch accounts. Being that log in is through Google, a user has to go to Google or Gmail to change accounts for TagPro. 

It would be helpful to have a "Switch User" option in each profile so that it can all be taken care of in one tab. 




 Great questions! There is a great amount of evidence to a historical Jesus, and they come from both believers and unbelievers. Here are just a few examples:

###Thallus (52AD)

He was quoted by Julius Africanus in 221AD as trying to explain away the a moment at Jesus' crucifixion: 

*"On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun." (Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)*

###Tacitus (56-120AD)
One of my favorites. One of the most trusted historians of his time, wrote:

*"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular."*

###Josephus (37-101AD)
Josephus wrote about Jesus most. He was born just four years after the crucifixion. He would have met men and women that knew of the Christ. 

*"Now around this time lived Jesus, a wise man. For he was a worker of amazing deeds and was a teacher of people who gladly accept the truth. He won over both many Jews and many Greeks. Pilate, when he heard him accused by the leading men among us, condemned him to the cross, (but) those who had first loved him did not cease (doing so). To this day the tribe of Christians named after him has not disappeared."*

There are other examples as well, including Lucius, Celsus, and the Jewish Talmud. There are paintings of the Christ in certain caves around Rome, when believers had to flee and hide due to persecution. If you look, you'll find some good stuff. Most scholars agree that Jesus lived. The chasm in belief comes when you get to his resurrection. 




 Pretty sure TagPro is a 25 year old male law student. 




 Love these items being implemented in the upcoming release. I really do enjoy this game and community, and want to try to do anything I can to help put in the appropriate fertilizer so that this thing can take off and grow over the coming months and years. 




 Eh. I disagree. In that logic, any and every rule is just an invitation for people to break it. Doesn't make sense to me. Rules help to provide a safe framework with which to work inside of in a civil manner.  




 This entire thread is making me laugh. Thank you /u/GrahamMc! Seriously hilarious.

Posting to make sure "Jack MeHoff" is an okay name. Your back up name? "Mike Hunt". Haha. This is too good.

That being said, I 100% agree with /u/quassus - you can do better, man. Come up with something original (and less immature). You can do it. If you are set on something slightly offensive, at least be smart about it. I'll give you a few punable options:

* Mothballs
* Ballieber (playing off of Belieber or whatever for that Justin kid)
* BytheBalls
* Nutz/Nuts/Knutz/Knuts
* TuffKnutz
* Ovaryaction
* SantasSack

But there are also some great less offensive names available:

* Skunk
* Meerkat
* Riot
* LookAtMe
* BallKing
* Gorgeous 




 I just imagine that this would make things so much worse. 




 I value your opinion, but disagree. I hate making the comparison, but that is like saying that everyone who plays League of Legends publicly desires to play competitively, Ranked, or Major League. 

I think there are a large majority that just want a casual, fun, and nice atmospheric game to play when bored. I don't think we can offer them that right now.

**Edit:** I read your comment as "players will always be looking for something more." That's not what you said. However, I'll leave my post as I believe the comparison still stands. 




 Actually kind of like this idea. That gives me the option of "going hardcore and stressing out" in a typical game OR having fun and chilling out in a fun game. 




 * **Effective Reporting System**  Maybe if someone receives three reports in a single game, they are temporarily timed out. This can help weed out some of the weaker trolls/bad guys.

* **Serious Penalties**  Punish repeat offenders. Longer bans  Permanent bans  IP bans. 

* **Name Filter**  I might be alone in this, but I still think it is silly and immature to allow any name under the sun. In my opinion, encouraging filthy names encourages filthy/offensive/rude/coarse language.

* **Honor System**  This has been mentioned and shot down. People should just be nice without an incentive. Sure, but that isnt happening. I think it would be nice to have an honor system with flair awarded to consistently nice and helpful players.

* **Matchmaking**  I know this might come later in the life of TagPro, but some form of degree level matchmaking might help in this. I dont think it needs to be perfect. But this would help to alleviate some of the stress/anger associated with playing on a team full of poor players.

*I'll add more as they come to mind.* 




 I've seen many people recently suggest that in order to get away from the bad players and filthy hate speech to "just play PUGs instead". I get it. I really do. I thoroughly enjoy PUGs (pick-up games), and while I find them more competitive, I find them to be a lot less stressful. But this can't possibly be the *only* solution!

PUBs (public games) are the front door to the TagPro universe. It is the only arena that most TagPro players will ever see. And it should be an okay place to reside and to flourish. Mumble, PUGs, and competitive leagues aren't for everybody, nor should they be. 

I think that there must be some solutions that can be worked into future patches that can help the public community.

I get it, this has been discussed before. But I think something must be done before the community gets polluted to the point of receiving a bad reputation and a bad name. 

Can we collect some ideas that might be able to be implemented in the near future that can help move towards a more healthy public environment? I've included some suggestions below.

**EDIT/P.S.:** I'm not perfect at this by any means. I get frustrated often. So I can relate to the aggressor. I just think there are some preventative measures that can be taken so that public games can once again be a fun place to be. 




 staer 




 You're awesome. I guess it just needs to be updated in the Wiki. Who could do that? 




 I wouldn't ever want to bug /u/NewCompte about a bug. /u/NewCompte, rest knowing that I wouldn't flood your inbox, /u/NewCompte, with way too many tags. /u/NewCompte, you can trust in me fully. However, /u/Newcompte, if you ever have the time to update your extension, /u/NewCompte, could you please update?  




 I know this has been addressed before, but I haven't found a fix.

I've downloaded the [TagPro Sound Chrome Extension](http://redd.it/1tqz4g). It works fine on all servers except for Origin. Under my "Extensions" tab, I see that it doesn't have permission for Origin. I don't know how to change this though. Don't even know if I can.

Is anyone else having this problem? How can I fix it?


(I'll remove the post if you can redirect me to a post with a solution.) 




 Don't have a mouse. GG.
