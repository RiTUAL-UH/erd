 I've tried Atkins, LA, Weight Watchers, and a few others. Nothing really took. Came to the realization that when I'm ready, I'll just need to watch what I eat for my own self.  




 I appreciate that but I hope you don't really give up. It's hard to find the right method of treatment, and there is no magic bullet, but you have to keep plugging on to make things better. Let me know if I can help.  




 It's my pleasure. I would recommend starting with a therapist. They generally are more counseling oriented as opposed to medication, but if the two of you decide that's the best option they can recommend you to someone. Generally I think that's probably your best start.  




 Computer, Tv, Playstation, yeah pretty much. I just need to work on my discipline and dedication.  




 I'm not crazy about the idea of taking anything illegal, but I appreciate the advice 




 Thanks for sharing. Prozac seems like it will help, I'm looking forward to feeling like a person.  




 Woke up not remembering doing anything/getting home/sleeping. 




 Oh it has been mentioned. One of the things I was looking forward to when I decided to do this.  




 LOL. No worries at all man. Thanks.  




 I monitor all those things. Drugs arent for everyone, but neither are the alternative lifestyles. Thanks for the good wishes though! 




 Better than being tri polar... 




 Doc advised that prozac can make you go limp, not that that matters in my current life, but that can be treated with meds.  




 I dont precisely know what happened but probably the former.  




 Repost: A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right.

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming.
 




 Hadn't ever heard of them, I'll start dropping by thanks. 




 Absolutely. That's part of why I did the AMA was to talk about different peoples methods.  




 What's our vector Victor? 




 Not saying that at all. There are people who have it much worse. Again, just felt like starting a conversation.  




 And most people do. My weight has fluctuated all my life and I have no doubt taking it off would help, but that's also not the magic bullet for it all.  




 You are both clever and the first one to make that assertation. Good for you.  




 There's not an official way that I'm aware of. Treatment with drugs working to balance things out I think is really the marker.  




 I was the same way until I got to the point where I was thinking about ending it. If you think you might have it and things aren't getting better, I cannot recommend going to see someone highly enough. Even if it's a school counselor, you can't always do it on your own.  




 lol. 




 Not a problem. let me know if I can help at all. 




 Many thanks for the well wishes! 




 Well for one not that many people do but for 2 They are two of my best friends and are usually considerate not to "shove their happiness in my face" when I'm in a lonly swing.  




 I have tried healthier living before, though not to that extent and it didn't help as much. I think if I go back to it with a combination of what I'm doing now, it'll work a lot better.  




 I want so badly to disagree with you...  




 Ok, that's cool. Like I said earlier, saw a topic on the front page and felt like starting a conversation.  




 1. Often. I do not have a good diet, and never have. I'm trying to correct this but habitual behavior and budget tend to get in the way. Will be working on this in therapy.

1b. 330 with a 6'2 Frame. very overweight

2. I've been told I don't snore often. I am getting tests done in a few weeks to see if sleep apnea is a possibility. 

3. Yes. I am in my house roughly 10 hours of the day in total. 

4. Not as much as I'd like, I'm planning a big move in a few months and need to budget better than I have been, however I do treat myself from time to time.  




 I lold in the literal sense. Well done. Have an upvote.  




 Much appreciated! Thank you for reading.  




 ... no 




 Apologies if I've been mistyping, been wading through a lot of replies. I'm currently seeing a Psychiatrist and a therapist.  




 It's a specialized name that will help narrow the treatment field to get me better. Knowing that I have Dysthymia with secondary MDD gives a therapist a better idea of what they're dealing with. 

And I know you were being sardonic but seeing what you know is a beautiful day and not being able to enjoy it can be pretty damn soul crushing.  




 First let me be clear that I am not a medical professional and so my advice should not be taken with the same weight as one. 

That being said, from my experience, those of my friends, and talking to counselors, the normal key things can be triggers, unusual amounts of stress, family problems, relationship problems etc, can all trigger what may have been under the surface for a while.  




 It depends on who you are seeing and if you have insurance. It's a specialized field so it can be pricey, but some practices are more willing to work with you than others. If you have insurance, find out if it covers mental and who is in your network. If not, start looking around. I go to a baptist behavioral health clinic. Those bigger clinics will be more able to help with prices than private practice in my experience.  




 It's a bitch aint it? 




 Whoops, thanks.  




 Yes, Yes, and Yes. Things work differently on different people.  




 Thank you very much, and I'm glad to hear you're doing better. That's encouraging.  




 I'm just starting the meds/therapy. I just developed a really dark sense of humor to help me cope when I didn't  know what was wrong with me which has been a gift and a curse. It can be off putting to some people, but it helps me get by.  




 Unfortunately, as I said earlier, there is no magic bullet. Just remember your family though. Suicide is never the answer, believe me I've been on the edge, maybe over it, you are loved and there is a way out of the hole, it's just a different path for everyone.
