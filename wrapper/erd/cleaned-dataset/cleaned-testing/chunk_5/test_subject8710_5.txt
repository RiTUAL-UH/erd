 im suprised that hasnt been used yet for vi. she has been around for atleast 2 Chinese new years.  




 as a current aatrox main i dont feel there is much that needs to be changed on him so hopefully what i say doesnt get downvoted because its not a significant change. 

1. passive - Aatrox passive could possibly give him bonus attack speed for using up all of his bloodwell given it normally gives him attack speed they could make it so that it decays percentage of actual attackspeed.
2. Q - aatrox Q is a really good engage/disengage however when ever your playing aatrox if you have your passive W up you can get an extremly good poke off just by jumping in and autoing and backing off with no real exchange. this isn't terrible but to fix this i believe that while airborn aatrox shouldn't be able to use his W to switch and make it so that the enemy atleast is given a chance before he flies like a majestic eagle.
3. W - not much to say about this except that if you have passive healing on that it should take away from your blood well as to make sure you are keeping your blood well high. (could even make the blood well heal you based on how full it is)
4. E - this skill is easy to hit and deals a good amount of damage nothing i would change on this because you still use your health to use it.
5. R - this skill is called massacre for a reason and i love the recent change with blood well being filled for what is hit around him however i wouldn't mind if when you activate it will instead of initially increasing his Attack Speed that it would increase based on how many people are around Aatrox 

alright hopefully this doesn't sound unbalanced in anyway but i also feel his kit is nice as a brawler. 




 i just recently started playing more ADC and i find this hillarious. Mainly because of the fact that i have felt like this when i got behind because i had not fully understood the role yet. 




 I was just talking about this with someone i helped get into league and personally alot of the unfriendlyness can come from not understanding the game. recently the meta has changed alot in favor of tanks and may be changing again soon, for someone new this wouldn't be a problem however they might fear the change in the game that might make their favorite champion not viable. obviously when you first start playing your not going to play against smurfs every game but smurfs can hurt a persons chances of wanting to play.
