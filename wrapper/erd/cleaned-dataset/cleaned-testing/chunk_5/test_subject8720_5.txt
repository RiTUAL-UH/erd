 Maybe try Glasslip? It isn't a straightforward anime though, like Akatsuki no Yona (which I also loved btw). I really enjoyed it though! Or maybe Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso? It was AMAZING 




 On Shinsekai Yori, I can understand why some people may say it started slowly. For the most part, a lot of the story is told quite subtly, or even not at all and we are left guessing. What makes SSY so good are all of the silences, where we're left grasping and guessing at what really happened and why.  




 I agree with everyone here recommending Shinsekai Yori - IT'S AMAZING  




 Is it more important to you to work a high-paying job which enables you to do heaps of awesome things and look after your family or work a job where you can follow your passion and enjoy your work without necessarily earning very much money? For example, I want to earn a lot of money one day so I can buy my mum a house, and afford my own house and take care of my younger sister and afford holidays and stuff.
