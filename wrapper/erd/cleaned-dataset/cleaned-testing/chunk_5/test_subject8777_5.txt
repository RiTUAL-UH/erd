 God damnit.. 




 Wow..yes, yes you did.
 




 Idk what in-n-out you went to but there is always at least a 15min wait for food because it is so packed..in any of them..the fries are not too great I will give you that, but the burgers are phenomenal! Not to mention not nearly as pricey as five guys either..meat and cheese baby, meat and cheese :) but I enjoy five guys as well. 









 wait til you try in-n-out burgers..only if you come to the west side of the states tho.. 




 bahahaha 









 What is your best pickup line and did it work? 





























 Wait, yea, just checked this guy out....this is total bullshit..he's been posting stuff for the last couple months about work and his "place"...I smell a Karma whore 




 Hope you have a job.. 




 I would sure hope after only 10 years you could..otherwise you would be a sparkling example of the divorce statistic in this country 
























 So basically you are telling everyone that you have it too... 




 Original, like ur style.. 









 looks like you have a real winner there. I feel a karma whore coming on, right about now..

 Atmosphere, MC Paul Barmen, Giant Panda, DJ Alibi 




 damn...rip eyedea 









 When you say wooshy, in what regard? Are you referring to the overheads of the drums or the guitars? 




 Very cool man! Well if you very get stuck on a mix for a band, let me know I'd love to help out where I can. Keep up the good work and advice! 




 Ok I appreciate that! I am opening up my DAW as we speak! 




 Do you do any work with bands or is it mainly production stuff? 




 Very cool man! What r unrunning in your studio if you don't mind me ask 




 Definitely do! Sounds like you know what you want to do with it! Keep up the good work! 




 Oh heck ya man, i have been reading through the past threads and I appreciate you giving quality advice and feedback to people. It's important for people to pass along the knowledge! 




 Thank you, ya sometimes it is hard to find that balance. With this genre of music there tends to be a lot of repetitiousness and so we try not to do too much of it because without lyrics it can start to get monotonous. Thank you for the feed back tho! Take a listen to our newest song, it is our Frankenstein song with some post rock, math rock and post hardcore influence [Caterpillar Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIdyxmSiV0) 




 I hear ya, I often hear tracks getting too muddy because of side chains on everything at certain points to make changes more prominent and that bugs the hell out of me. The track sounds great tho man! Crisp and clear  




 The structure of the song is good and the lyrical content is there, but as at as the mix goes there are a couple things that could be done. I am glad to see you are a fellow logic user tho :) the vocals sound like they could be compressed a little more, just to smooth them out and sit them in the mix a little nicer. The snare also seems to have a bit of a long tail on the reverb when it is hit, or it could be the natural decay of the snare, but either way tightening up a gate a little on it might make it sound a little less muddy..but then again sometimes that's nice to have. 




 I appreciate that! Did you listen to it in headphones by chance...the stereo image of this song is actually quite big :) now I need to zone out and listen to it again and again haha 




 Hahaha rad man! I am a rock musician too bt do hip hop stuff on the side so I appreciate where you are coming from and putting this out there! You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more! 




 This track sounds real good! The drops are solid and the build ups are nice and fluid..I get a little bit of some weird phantom frequencies around the 2-3k range but I am also listening with Grado's and they hear everything too well haha... Maybe try side chaining an low end oscillator to your kick on the drops to give it a little more DROP.. The track is awesome tho man, quite the listening experience! 




 I like the track very different sounding..the only thing I would say is with the way that the vocals are mixed, very light and airy with tons of reverb, I almost wanted to hear some solid drums in the track, at least something at would drop at some point, just to give the track some continuity...nothing to crazy but a simple electronic beat or a minimal DnB beat would suffice, just because it feels as tho that would keep the interest of the listener a little more, but that's just IMHO. Keep up the good work! 




 Just listened to the song and I really like the guitar work..it is busy bt not overwhelming which is what I like... I think if you were to find the right drummer for it to keep it busy and interesting bt at the same time able to come back to a solid rhythm, I think the song could have a real math/indie rock feel to it...I am a drummer and would love to record something to it for fun! I will definitely be jamming to it later either way!

Hello fellow music makers! I am pretty much finished with a mix I did for my post rock instrumental band. The song is called Surface. Take a listen and any feedback and/or criticism is always welcome and encouraged! Hope you enjoy! (If you have headphones, I'd put them on now)

 Hey man! Just listened to the song and it has a nice feel when it first comes into the verse bt then it starts to get a little repetitious..maybe break it up with some sort of change in the song..an effect or chorus or something because the verse feels a bit too long :)  




 The EP sounds great man, there is a lot of room in there for some samples that might be a nice compliment to the song.. Very good sounding and the vocalist has good dynamic! Sounds like a good project to be a part of! Good luck! 



















 I didnt even see the dude on the floor till he started spazing out hahaha
