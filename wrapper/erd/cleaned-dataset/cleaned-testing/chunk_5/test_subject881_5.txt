 Ok. Thanks anyway. 




 Hi,   
could you please tell me where i should have post the pic? And in my opinion, the picture is neither a strikt political post nor just text.   
I does definitly not fit into r/jokes   
Sincerely, test_subject881 




 It's not me. 


































 I see what you did here! 




 Hello, my name is Turing. Wanna chat? 










































































 Yes, it is possible. [Here you have it first-hand](http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-12176/#/gallery/17219) from the lander Project Manager Stephan Ulamec:   
   
'Contact in the coming year

Stephan Ulamec believes it is probable that in the **spring of 2015**, the DLR LCC will once again communicate with Philae and receive data about how the lander is faring on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. In the **summer of 2015**, it might be possible that temperatures on the comet will allow Philaes battery to be recharged. "The orbiter will continue with its overflights to receive any signals from the lander once Philae wakes up from hibernation." ' 




 No probolem 




 I deleted the previous post, because the link hit a paywall.   
And the title isn't misleading. Read the fourth paragraph. It says "... COSAC was able to 'sniff' the atmosphere and detect the first organic molecules after landing."

 



















 Damn it! It looks like a perfect landing spot. To bad that the harpoons didn't work. 




 I just read this post in the rhythm of [Nancy Sinatras Bang Bang](http://youtu.be/T5Xl0Qry-hA). It works! 
























 Life in Lubbock, Texas taught me two things: One is that God loves you and you're going to burn in hell. The other is that sex is the most awful, filthy thing on earth, and you should save it for someone you love. 









 The "weight" of Philae on the comet is ~4 gramm which is converted ~0,00881849049 lbs 









 I just read "genetically modified cops are the future" and was thinking: wtf?! 



















 Here you see why the Oxford comma is so important! 









 Here you go:
