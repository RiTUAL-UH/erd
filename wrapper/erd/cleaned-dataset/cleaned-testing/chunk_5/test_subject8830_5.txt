 seriously, the "group amnesia" that happens in the first disk bothers me so much. just comes off as lazy writing

I completely agree. And then when Irvine admits he recognised everyone when the realisation comes at the orphanage, it's just like WTF why didn't you say anything on disk one. Its like the writing team changed after the first disk.
 




 Yeah in 8 it started off well but the whole thing in space was just cringe worthy. At least in 9 it was certainly portrayed better. More of a classic tail... tale
