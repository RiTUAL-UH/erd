I just do not give a fuck during anger and that terrifies me. 




 I am very strong Agnostic and nothing can change me. I have no proof, I have no evidence and therefore I do not know if there is a heaven or hell or even a god. 
Even though I wish the end of life would be a happy ending, I don't trust it. Maybe it is trust issues I have with humanity as a whole and how the greater good in someones mind could be the bad.
Another reason : Cults, the Tea Party and politics. All I can do without.

 Mr. out_of_my_mind89, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response was there anything that could even be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
