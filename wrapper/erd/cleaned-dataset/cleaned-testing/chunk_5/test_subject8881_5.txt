 Yes. You are right. I don't know how that slipped past me. Pretty stupid.  




 When introducing E Corp to the audience, Elliot mentions that he, after a tough intensive self-reprogramming, now only sees Evil Corp and not E Corp. And after that whenever E Corp is mentioned, they switch it with Evil Corp. It's just that Elliot's perspective is unreliable.  




 I also have that doubt. Tyrell has a good understanding of Tech. He is smart. He already knew Elliot's name. He doesn't say anything about Elliot's switch of files. And he invites him to the board meeting. Even if he is not an imagination of Elliot, he probably does have some significance in his life.  




 Alright, so I watched the first episode just yesterday and watched it for a second time today. Some of you guys have mentioned getting a Fight Club vibe from the show. I think this is a possibility.

This might be a spoiler for few of you, so I'm giving it a Spoiler tag : 
 
[To see how legitimate this theory is, lets establish what we already know. 
 1. Elliot has some mental issues. He is delusional. 
 2. The entire story is from Elliot's point of view, which is not reliable, because of his state of mind. He mentions that "after a through intensive self-reprogramming I now only see Evil corp instead of E Corp" and then for the rest of the episode, even we see and hear Evil Corp. 
 3. This is a strong one : Mr. Robot only interacts with Elliot. If you watch the episode again, you will notice that Mr. Robot doesn't interact with anyone else except Elliot. For the most part, no one even looks at Mr. Robot except Elliot. One exception though, he does try talking to the "Men In Black" at the table who are following Elliot. 
  4. Mr. Robot respected his father, who was a petty thief and is now dead. Elliot was good at talking to only his father. You could say he respected him a lot, like Mr. Robot. But Elliot's father, according to him, died of  leukemia, which he got from the radiation company he worked at.  
  5. Elliot hates the Society, and so does Mr. Robot. "Fuck Society" as they believe.
  6. Elliot is not happy working for his Security Company. He doesn't say it directly, but it's clearly implied that if given a chance to take E Corp down, he would. And Mr. Robot seems to be the guy who gives him this chance.  
   7. Tyrell Wellick, the Senior Vice President of Technology at E Corp, somehow already knew Elliot's name. It might be that he got his name from his employee ID card. But it's never shown. So that's that.   
   8. Tyrell also saw Elliot change the file before submitting it to FBI. But he does nothing about it. 
    9. In the end of Episode 1, Tyrell invites Elliot to his "top 1% of top 1%" meeting, who are probably the board members of E Corp. This could mean that Tyrell was involved in the whole thing from the beginning. It could be possible that he was the one to hire Elliot for the job.](/spoiler) 

There could be few other things I missed out. If you guys also noticed something, mention it in the comments.  



















 I think it should be, "Am I as bored as he is?" instead of "..you are?"
