 I posted part one of this story last night; you should read it here: [Part 1 - Invisibility] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p11q/part_1_invisibility/) before continuing, so you can understand, at least, as vaguely as I do, what happened.
It has become more urgent for me to get the rest of this story out there, before I completely forget how I got backor that I had even left
*************************
As Diana and Kate attempted to ignore what happened with the phone, and have a normal conversation, I frantically explored the room, trying to figure out what happened.  

I was still in the kitchen, thats for sure.  I could see the phones and other accessories which were left behind as the others vanished, and I could see Diana and Kate carrying on as if the falling phone were the only strange thing to happen that night.  But they could not see me.  

This could not be happening. I wasnt drunk I wasnt crazy Was I?  

*What happened to the others?* I wondered.  *Ive just disappeared as well then, as far as Diana and Kate are concerned.*  I had disappeared from their vision, and presumably, from their memories, as I had witnessed happen to the others who had been in the kitchen after I had returned from the bathroom.  

But, if the same thing had happened to all of us, then where were they?  Why was I, effectively, alone?

Then, it hit me.  This all started after I returned from the bathroom, and had seen the profound darkness seeping in from the window.  I looked up at the glass to see the same starless depths; but this time, I could see the rooftops, as lighter shadows in the darkness.  When I had re-entered the kitchen, it had seemed different to me.  It also seemed that I was the only one who had noticed, and that I was the only one who still remembered the others as they disappeared.  Having held the phone up to Dianas face before dropping it in surprise, I realized that they could not see the personal effects left behind either.  Until I had moved one and made a sound.

I concluded two things: the people disappearing must have gone into another dimension, or reality, thus erasing themselves from this one, and I was in between the two, in some strange fog of an existence.  That would explain why I could see some things from both and could witness and remember the disappearances from this dimension into the unknown.  

But, how did I end up between the dimensions?  Did the whole room shift to another dimension while I was in the bathroom, or, more logically, as I was passing through the door?  Were the people who disappeared also here, in the room, between dimensions, all alone, unable to see each other?  Or could they actually have gone back to our real, or home, dimension?  If thats the case, why didnt I go back too when I disappeared from here?  Wherever here is...   Was I worried about the wrong people?  Were Diana and Kate the ones in danger then?  

*Well if people left behind objects when they disappeared, I wonder if they left behind anything else*

I shook the thought, as it was useless to wonder about the worst case scenarios.  

So what determined when someone would phase out of this dimension?  I needed to try and get Diana and Kate out of there.  I didnt know for sure if the others had gone back to our home dimension, or if they had ended up somewhere elsebut in any case, what I knew for sure was that none of us belonged here, in this detached reality.  

I hadnt actually seen anyone disappear; I only saw the things they left behind.  I wish I had paid more attention sooner.  Maybe I could have seen how it was happening.  I had phased out, although I was only half-way in to begin with, after I had gone under the table.  Chris clearly also disappeared while he was under that table.  

But that didnt make any sense, as  the others had disappeared on the other side of the room.  Could it be from touching the phone?   I had already touched my phone before that.  Maybe my phone was between dimensions with me, so it didnt count.  Maybe Chris took the phone out to light the space under the table.  Do did everyone disappear when they checked their phones?  Can phones not technically exist in this dimension?  Is it like dividing by zero in ours?  

Only one way to find out, I thought.  I had to get Diana and Kate to check their phones.  

I turned towards them.  

Wow; how long have we been here talking?  I thought we were going to a party. Kate seemed a little disappointed.

Diana reached into her coat pocket.  *well that was easy* I thought.  I didnt have to do anything.

She clicked the side button and looked at Kate.  Well, its almost 7:30, so were half an hour early apparently.  

I sank down to the floor.  Not only was my theory out the window into the darkness beyond, but, as inexplicable as it seemed, time was still going backwards.  

Well what else could it be?  I thought, leaning on the table for support to stand up.  As I did, my fingertips brushed against a keychain on the table.  Suddenly, I felt dizzy again.  I thought maybe I stood up too fast, but no, I hadnt.  I had written it off as crouching and standing too fast when I felt dizzy after coming out from under the table with the phone, but that had not been the case this time.  I had touched something someone left behind.  Like Chriss phone, touching that keychain had made me dizzy.  Was I back in this dimension?  

I walked up to Diana.  Kate had gone to the bathroom.  Hey. I said, hopefully.  

There was no answer.

Knowing that the others cannot see the artifacts left-behind, I was sure that touching them is what had made them randomly phase out.  Clearly it only works once, or only in one direction.  In any case, I needed to get them to touch something that was left behind.  But how could I do that if they cant see the things?

I crossed the room and grabbed the lighter off of the floor by the sink.  Holding it made the floor seem to rotate and lean beneath me, but I took careful baby steps, using the table to steady myself.  As I reached the table on which Diana sat, legs dangling, Kate returned to the room from the bathroom.  She looked right at me and said Hey!  Im glad youre here.  What are you doing with that lighter?  I thought you didnt smoke.

Diana looked towards me and back at Kate.  Who are you talking to? she asked, perplexed.

Kate looked confused.  I realized what was going on.  

Its ok Kate; I tried to calm her.  Just come over here and Ill try and explain what Ive seen so far.  

She suddenly looked afraid of me.  Are you a..are you  Her eyes grew wider.  Am I.?

What are you rambling about?  asked Diana, looking concerned.

You cant see her? 

See who?  What are you talking about?

I interjected.  Kate, were in between dimensions.  When I got back from the bathroom, I saw that things had changed in here, and people were disappearing.

What? Kate didnt seem to get what I was saying, until she saw the empty shoes and choker necklace to her left on the floor.  EElizabeth?  She choked out.

Who? said Diana.

Kate looked up and gasped at the site of all the random objects strewn about the room, abandoned where there owners had stood.

Although I had made some sort of sense out of what had happened to us, I was left with more questions than answers.  Not just the obvious where did everyone go? question, but

If I wound up between the dimensions because I was not in the room when the shift occurred, how did Kate get in between them?  Just by leaving the room?

Also, if people phased out of this dimension by touching the objects left behind by others who had phased out, how did the first person phase out?

**************

I still dont know the answers to some of those questions, and the answers I do have are quite vague.  Although it didnt make a lot of sense, at least I wasnt alone anymore at that point.  

The rest of what happened goes way beyond the character limit, so I guess this is a good stopping point to break it up.  I will post the last part tomorrow.  Its already typed up, so I know I wont forget it.
 




 its when you put so much mental energy into something that you sort of make it real.  See, as you probably know, your energy and intentions have an impact on the world around you, so a tulpa happens when you focus your thought energy on a concept and that energy forms into a manifestation of the concept.   




 I am normally an advice-giver, but I just wanted to share the experience I had around noon as I was in the kitchen, washing a plate on which to put my brunch.  

Now, I have mentioned in comments that I have never been one to "see" spirits and such in the physical/traditional sense. I feel things, I sense things, I know things, I see things in my mind's eye, but I don't physically see them.

I have on occasion seen a bug wander off out the corner of my eye, only to turn and see nothing, but that I have learned is a simple optical illusion/ hallucination from stress and is quite common.  I accepted that explanation just fine, and do not really have a reason to be concerned for that even if it's not.

But, what I saw in the kitchen this morning was different.  It was a black shadow, about the size of a kitten.  I was facing the sink, and the shadow came from behind me.  It had leapt up.  I saw it pass by over my shoulder, by my head, and over the countertop.  

The sink and counter-top is not up against the wall; there is a few feet of space behind the counter before the window.  So, this shadow leapt over me and the counter.

Although it was surprising, as I normally cannot see such things, I kept my composure and finished washing the plate, not taking my eyes off of the small portion of floor I could see over the countertop.  I didn't see anything there.  It could have been up against the countertop, or not there anymore. In any case, I was concerned, because, having lived in this building for two months at this point, I had not gotten any impression of any presences here.  I have not sensed anything.  Granted, I have been quite preoccupied with numerous things, but this was completely unexpected.  I wasn't sure what to do, if anything, so I just cooked my brunch and went about my day.

By the way, there are no pets allowed here.  It was like a small chubby kitten in size, but the shape was more like a brush-stroke of black paint, trailing off behind, with tiny nubs at the bottom like feet, but nothing that looked like a head; the top was just a flat contour.

And, I have black hair, which at first instant I thought could have tricked me from the corner of my eye, with the movement over my shoulder, but when it continued over the countertop, I knew that wasn't the case. 


I thought I'd share this with you guys and see if anyone who normally can see such things has any ideas about what they may be exactly?


Edit: tl/dr: I saw a dark shadow leap over my shoulder and the counter top in the kitchen this afternoon.


edit 2: I just realized it's probably a tulpa.  I started writing a fictional multi-part story on /r/nosleep last night, and it took place in a kitchen and involved inter-dimensional phasing shrouded in darkness.  So I think I'm responsible for the shadow.  I don't mean I made myself see it; I saw what I saw; I mean, I have this theory now that maybe I generated or attracted it.  Especially given my writing history [see here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/2zuzkb/predictive_poetry/ )


Is that theory plausible? 




 After reading many of your stories, I have been inspired to share my own.  I was reluctant at first, partially for having to re-live it all in my mind, and partially because, should anything positive come of it, I might have it all stripped away from me.


Anyway, I'm not even sure where to begin.  I guess chronologically would be the best way, or at least, the least nonsensical way to approach it.  

*******************

It was 8:35 pm on Friday, February 27th.  I was at a simple party with some friends, acquaintances, and unfamiliar students in a kitchen in my own apartment building but on a different floor.  It was a normal, chill Friday evening with my favorite cider in hand and my ears buzzing with humor and camaraderie.  


I'm not sure when I lost touch with reality.  Perhaps chronologically is not the best way to go, since I'm not really sure what that is anymore.  By "lost touch with reality," I don't by any means mean drunk.  Although I have never been drunk, and thus cannot relate or compare, I can assure you that I was not drunk at all.  I mean I  physically lost touch.  It's as if one minute, I was in the kitchen talking to my friends, surrounded by others mingling, and, when I returned from "breaking the seal", as I learned to call it, I had shifted into another existence.  


I was still in the building, as far as I could tell.  I entered the kitchen from the same door I had left to use the bathroom, and everything appeared to be normal; the room was still abuzz with chatter, but no one seemed to notice the deep blackness outside the partly-opened window.  Where there had been stars in the sky, rooftops, the glow of light posts, and the shadows thereof, there was now only blackness.  A void so profound, that "black" cannot begin to describe its inky depths.  This was no power outage, as the lights were still on in our building.  There also seemed to be a general haze over the party, like a wispy grey cloud of smoke; although there were no cigarettes lit indoors; it was against our housing agreement.  Perhaps it had filtered in through the window from the depths beyond.  It's as if we were no longer in our city anymore, or even the same dimension.  


No one else seemed to notice though, and I was startled from my reverie by my friend Diana.  

Checking out the view, huh? she said with a smirk.


I realized that, in my contemplation of the eerie vibe of the room, I had been unwittingly staring in the direction of a mutual friend, as he was bent over looking for something.


I must have looked surprised, because Diana began to giggle and slap my shoulder with one hand and her knee with the other.  She was already quite drunk it seemed.  I smiled, shrugged it off, and walked over to our mutual friend.  


Hey Chris.

Oh.  Hey he replied, not looking up from under the corner table.

I had shrugged Dianas comment off so easily because I am not particularly concerned with butts.  Backs, on the other hand

Is everything ok? I said as his back and the rest of him disappeared under the table.

yeah, Im just looking for mah msudfhsdjf ssfkjd.

what?

Im just loodsljflkjsfd msuhdfshduo.

I wasnt sure if it was because of the table or because he was facing away from me, but his voice was getting harder to distinguish from the dull roar of the party.  


I turned around to see that half of the others, the people I didnt really know, had disappeared.  I walked back over to Diana; she was now talking and laughing with our classmate Kate, the only person in our group who was shorter than me.  I asked them where the others went.  
Diana laughed.  What are you talking about? she asked with a scoff; everyones still here.  As she giggled at my perceived silliness, I realized that, in her state, it just wasnt registering.  Kate, on the other hand, was just as sober as I was; so, I was quite disturbed when she said that she didnt remember there being more people in the kitchen, but if anyone had left, theyd probably gone to the club, since she vaguely remembered someone mention dancing.  Although it was strange that they didnt remember seeing other people, the explanation was at least somewhat satisfactory at the time, although I wish now that Id paid more attention.


I turned around to address my other friend, Elizabeth, who was chatting with a guy I didnt know.  She introduced him as Bradley.  We chattered about our courses and other general topics for a while, and when I finally turned around again, and walked to the other side of the center table, I saw something that made me wish I had gone that way sooner.  Finding a phone left on the table is nothing unsual on its own, but finding a phone on the table, a lighter on the floor, earrings on the counter, keys by the fridge, and an odd assortment of other personal effects strewn around where at least fifteen other people had stood just minutes before.that is pure terror.  I whipped around and made for my coat.  When I pulled out my phone and unlocked it, the screen said 8:30 pm.  But I was certain I had arrived at 8:35, and that had to be at least an hour ago.


Elizabeth, Bradley, Diana, Kate, and about 6 other people were still in the room.  Then, I thought of Chris.  From where I stood, across the room, I had a clear view under the corner table.  The only thing there was a cellphone.


I darted over to Diana and Kate.  Not knowing any of the others names, and in light of her previous refusal to acknowledge that anyone else had even been in the room, also in my mounting hysteria, I grabbed Diana by the shoulders and demanded Wheres Chris?


Who? She asked.

I took a step back.  Chris.our friend?  You were just making fun of me for looking at him five minutes ago.

Youre funny. Diana gurgled as she spoke; she was beyond intoxicated; I was surprised she hadnt passed out.  I dont know what youre talking about.

I turned to Kate, and she was just watching this exchange with a curious expression, still holding the same small glass of soda.
I needed to know I wasnt crazy.  Against my better judgement, with a sense of dread and morbid curiosity, I lunged under the table and grabbed the phone.  


When I stood up, I felt dizzy.  I must have dove under the table and back up far too quickly.  I waited a moment for the haze to steady before clicking the side button of the phone.  The screen lit up reading 7:55 pm.  Although I was disturbed by this, I was relieved to see the background was a picture of Chris, Diana, and some other classmates at some sort of event.  I rushed over to Diana and Kate to show them.  I saw them talking and laughing like normal.  Diana did not seem to be drunk at all.  


See? I said, holding the phone up to their faces.  Right there; thats Chris, and you, and Elizabeth.


But Diana didnt seem to hear me.  She looked sober, but was too busy laughing to even acknowledge what Id said.  I turned to my right, where Elizabeth and Bradley had been standing, only to find a pair of shoes and a choker necklace there instead.


I dropped the phone.


The resulting shatter echoed like a deafening roar on the tile floor, and finally got Dianas attention.  She looked down at the phone.  There was an expression of shock and disbelief in her eyes, as she turned to Kate, who looked equally perturbed.  


*Yes*, I thought.  Theyve seen the picture and they know Im not crazy now.  


They looked up from the phone to the ceiling, and then looked right through me at the opposite wall.


...maybe it fell off the table. Kate offered sheepishly, looking at Diana with a hopeful expression, wanting to make herself believe it too.
yeahthat must be it Diana trailed off.


I realized then that they were visibly creeped out, but not because they realized everyone was disappearing, one by one, but because the phone had just inexplicably fallen at their feetbecause they couldnt see me.

*********************

I am feeling really drained, so I will have to continue this tomorrow

edit: fixed some spacing issues

edit: here is the link to [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31tekm/part_2_just_a_phase/) 




 that's interesting; I haven't heard about people having higher charges before.  I've only heard of/ been concerned with auras, energy, and sensitivities.  I've screwed up several overhead projectors in one sitting, but that was on purpose, so I don't think overcharging on purpose is quite the same thing as having a higher resting charge.... 




 this is an old thread from here, but it shows how a lot of kids have talked about past lives, so you're far from alone on that http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d2v7i/parents_of_reddit_what_is_the_creepiest_thing/  




 dreams offer insight into our subconscious; things that have been bothering us, things we don't want to admit to ourselves, and things that we've picked up on but haven't given much thought to.

It sounds like you have been shaken up by recent events in your life, and facing these events has made you contemplate your own mortality.

It is interesting that you chose to attack the train rather than find out what was wrong and try to better the situation.  Perhaps this means that you are approaching this life event from the wrong angle and it is tearing you apart; you see others carrying on and you on a whole different level, unable to carry on as they do.  

Perhaps this dream serves as a sign that you need to approach the situation differently, so that you may come out better/ in one piece. 




 dreams provide insights into our subconscious; things we are worried about, things we don't want to admit, and things we picked up on but haven't actively thought about.  

I don't think it's just about your emotions.

I don't know what you're going through personally, so only you can make this determination, but it seems like you are worried about expectations or decisions you have to make, like everyone is looking to you to come through on that, and that scares you and makes you feel like your world is either falling apart or changing around you.  

Perhaps its a big decision which will shape your future? 




 I second this; /u/friend-killer , if you are sensitive /open to that sort of thing, then things that want attention seek you out more because they know they can get it.  They can sense it (just like how some predatory animals can smell fear). Although these occurrences seem harmless.  

I'm not sure what /u/smeefeltz means by getting your charge checked.  I would imagine he or she means getting someone who can feel/sense auras and energies to get a feel for you and see what kind of and how much energy and vibes they can sense from you.

Not sure how you go about finding legit people in person though. 




 I realized after reading this that the demon (or other thing) was fucking with them the whole time, since it knew they thought the room next door was the suicide room.  The whispers and whatnot that they heard from that shared wall were only coming from there to make them continue to believe that was the room rather than the room they were in. 

I also, like others have said, thought Beth could be a ghost or something.  Given now that they never saw her out of the room, I'm thinking Beth may have been a manifestation of the thing, or a shared hallucination caused by the thing.  It's kind of a stretch, but it's possible.  If not, then the thing heard her tell them the room next door was the suicide room, and proceeded to fuck with them like so.  

It's just another layer of fucked-up ness about the whole thing.   




 knowing that you're dreaming is one thing, controlling it is quite another.  When I get consistently adequate sleep, becoming self-aware in my dreams is automatic.  Taking control is another story.  I don't deliberately try to do that much, because it takes some of the fun out of a dream for me; the random adventure is what makes dreams great.  Also, you can't gain insights into your subconscious thoughts, or things you've perceived but didn't consciously acknowledge or admit, if you control the dream. 

I have taken control a couple of notable times.  The speaking thing is definitely important.  The best dream I took control of started with my appearing in my old school, recognizing it was a dream, and asking a janitor what year it was.  From there I went on to explore, and gained some insight into what made some of my classmates tick.  I was in control of myself, but I did not try to manipulate the dream itself.  I just explored around as an observer.  

The other notable time I took control, I took off flying through a massive library on a griffon, and I lost confidence and began to plummet for a while before I picked up altitude again, but everything felt fake and it was no longer fun or magical.

now, if you are having a bad dream, you need to know how to wake yourself up.  Once you know you are dreaming, the only thing you need to do to wake yourself up is to get off to an area where no one will disturb you, close your eyes, take deep breaths, and count backwards from whatever number feels natural to you.  I use 10, but that may be because figured that technique out around that age.  Use whatever number works best for you.  With 10, I was usually awake by 3 or 4.  Some people say to wake up from a dream, you need to fall asleep, so that may work for you as well.

I hope you can gain some insight and/or ideas from this 




 The waters were rougher than ever before; I remember that night like it was yesterday.  The water level had risen quickly, and unseen forces lifted me up from behind and tossed me around the waves.  I could see a pirate ship in the distance, battered by the stormy seas, and bearing a large bite-mark on the port flank, perhaps from a run-in with the great white on the horizon.  I could faintly hear the sailors screaming at each other in a panic. IT WAS LARGER THAN ANY CREATURE I HAVE EVER SEEN one pirate yelled.  

The unseen force lifted me again, but this time, it poked me in the eye.  Its digits must have been enormous, as just one of them obscured my whole face as it lifted me from the tumultuous waves, placing me right next to the ship.  However, the pirates did not seem to notice me, as they were absorbed in a panic over the thing which had just placed me there, passing closely over the mast. STEADY NOW, SHES COMING BACK AROUND Shouted the captain as he gripped tightly to the wheel, trying to maintain control of the ship. FIRE THE CANNON he screamed as loud as he could, in an attempt to be heard over the thunderous thrashing of the waves. The captains face paled with terror when, instead of cannonballs, water started flowing from the cannons. WEVE SPRUNG A LEAK CAPN one of the crew members shouted. WE AVNT GOT MUCH TIME the captain shouted. To my horror, the ship was quickly swallowed into the shadowy depths.  I wondered if I would be next.  

As I tried to swim away against the current, to no avail, I heard a rumble.  Sputtering and gurgling, the ship rose once again from beneath the waves, just as quickly as it had gone down.  The crew, though thoroughly soaked, seemed otherwise unharmed.  They gasped with shock as the massive limb pulled away from the ship loosening its grip.  They had been in its grasp the whole time.  As the water shrank away beneath me, and began to spiral in a whirlpool, I realized I had been picked up by the creature too.  It squeezed me with such force that it knocked the wind out of me with a shrill squeak.  I gasped for air as it relaxed its grip.  Although my back was to the creature, I realized it was bigger than I had first thought, as it rose up to its full height, towering over the waves and the seemingly tiny pirate ship.  Then, I felt it; a sharp, stabbing pain in my rear.  IT WAS GOING TO EAT ME!  Then there was a harsh booming sound, startling the creature to release me.  

I landed upside down, head first, onto the green, fuzzy ground.  My heart was racing; but then, I felt a gentle touch cradle me and wrap me in something soft.  It seemed to massage the pain and fear right out of me.  When I emerged, I was completely dried.  Then it picked me up and dropped me into a brown room, with the great white and the pirate ship. Through a crack in the wall, I could see the backs of the smaller and larger creatures as they walked away.  Then the lights went out, there was a loud thud, and we were left to ourselves until the next night. 




 funny dream; made me laugh out loud. 

my ex told me about a weird dream he had last week which ended with my mom hopping onto my back and me running off like a horse into the sunset.  That was freakin hilarious. 




 Another possibility is that we all just mis-read it/ mis-pronounced it as children, and remember our incorrect pronunciation rather than the real spelling.

It's also possible there are some kids out there who perceive it as Berenstein like we used to... 




 well she was too drunk at that point to think clearly 




 well, now, I've actually come to no sleep because most of the stories here are of far better quality than those in /r/creepypasta 




 truly amazing; the general premise of a roller coaster with secret split tracks to unknown fates reminds me of a Goosebumps book called Horrorland which I read as a child.  Your interpretation of the concept though is much better I think, because it is more true to life (Horrorland involved monsters of the imaginary kind rather than the real, human kind).

I'm sure you've heard of H.H. Holmes and his world's fair hotel? 




 not necessarily.  

The idea that it was a shift in reality implies, as some people in the other linked threads pointed out, that those who always remembered Stain were either moved into this reality with the spelling, or we were all moved into theirs.  

If it is about our perception of reality, then those who always remembered Stain didn't experience the shift in perception that the rest of us did, meaning they already perceived the world this way before the event that caused the rest of us to shift to this perspective.

We all perceive things differently, so it stands to reason that some people already perceived it in the Stain way 




 as far as the second 2 are concerned, read this and maybe get your eyes checked https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31bkpi/meta_psa_see_something_out_of_the_corner_of_your/

Although I have had things disappear and come back, as have we all. 

The beiber thing is interesting.  In relation to the first one, someone else recently posted about having seen a movie before it came out so maybe talk to them? http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31cev8/i_saw_a_movie_before_it_even_came_out/ 




 This is mind-blowing.  I used to pronounce it BerenstEEn, and there is no way I would say steen with an a in it.  

This is incredibly disturbing.  But I have a theory.  I read about the shifting realities idea, and I think it is much simpler than that. 

Reality did not shift; our perception of it did.

(the following theory comes from my experiences studying Criminal Justice and Psychology formally, and science informally, as well as my personal thoughts)

It is a well-known fact that everyone perceives and experiences things differently.  This is why 10 people could witness an event and have experienced it and remembered it in 10 different ways.  This is due to one's perceptual set, or frame of reference.  We all perceive and understand the world differently, in our own unique ways, based upon our experiences and understanding.  (for a clear and simple example, someone from the developing world would experience DisneyWorld fireworks differently than a Los Angeles native). 

Although each individual's experiences shape his or her perceptual set, large portions of it are shaped by culture.  So, let's consider our western young-adult demographic as a culture for this situation.  

Something caused a sharp shift in our culture's collective frame of reference.  We now perceive the world differently than we did as children (not necessarily just from becoming adults, although that is possible), and thus the shift from Stein to Stain is not a shift in reality, but rather a shift in our perception of reality.  We can find no record of Stein because no matter what we look at, we will perceive it as Stain.

The cause of the shift could be adulthood, 9/11, or anything else which has greatly altered all of our perceptual sets.

Thoughts? 




 I used to blog mine, back when I consistently got enough sleep to have and vividly recall interesting dreams (meaning High School). From August 2009 to September 2011 I posted 113 dreams.  Many of the ones I posted could easily be adapted into stories, but I didn't edit or embellish them for the blog.  you can check it out here if you want: http://epicdreamadventures.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/scb-dream-7-haunted-house.html   (the link is to one of the more memorable ones) 




 I've had lots of things like that happen, but the most notable was one time when my family and I were coming back from a road trip.  We had gotten souvenirs for friends and such, and the bag continaing them just disappeared in the car.  It was well in there, so it didn't just fall out.  And even when we cleaned the car out to trade it in, we never found it.  At one point before trading it in, my dad even found a gap/secret compartment under the seat, and the bag wasn't there either.  They just disappeared. 




 hi; sorry I took so long to get to this; I had an essay due before Spring Break.  Anyhow, here is one for the first story, where the dragon burns down the boat.  http://imgur.com/2bordiM

I noticed the other you've recieved is in black and white, so I left it as such.  Would you prefer they be in color?  

It just occured to me that, if this is going to be printed out and distributed to the class, that they could treat them like coloring books :) 




 it's just the standard human level of psychicness :) 




 I actually just last week had something like that happen, where my ex and I both, the same night, had dreams which involved me being at his house.  It was weird.  




 that happens to me too with facebook.  I'll have it up in the background while I'm doing something else, and then I'll randomly un-minimize it just in time to see a message come in.  It's like I could sense I was about to get a message.  Happens almost every day. 




 Actually I have this all the time; I call it my mental alarm clock. 

I always wake up around 5 minutes before my alarm, every day that I have somewhere to be.   I think I adapted this way because being awakened by an alarm is unpleasant and jarring, so I guess this is my subconscious's way of helping me avoid that and wake more gently. 

It works even if I forget to set the alarm though, or flip it on.  I still wake up 5 minutes before the alarm time.

I am studying abroad now, and I was afraid at first that I would lose  my mental alarm clock to the time change/ jet lag, but I didn't.

It's not just about waking up though.  I think this works for me because I tend to remember things if I write them down.  Like, if I make a shopping list, then I remember what I need without actually having to look at it.  Same with class notes.  The act of writing things down makes me memorize them.  

So, I think the mental alarm clock is related to that, in a general sense, seeing as I don't write down the time I need to wake up...

Do you also remember things just by writing them down? 




 *sipping the lemonade I just bought*
So, how's business going?  Oh, you've made $60?  Good for you.
Oh, no I am happy for you, it's just not as much as you think it is.  See, when you grow up, and have bills to pay, $60 doesn't go as far as it does when you're just buying candy and toys. 

Time works the same way; it's all relative.

When you've only been alive for 5 years, one year is a fifth of your life, so it feels longer to you.  But when you're 10, like yourself, a year is only a tenth of your life, so it should feel half as long as it did when you were 5.  As you get older and that fraction gets smaller, days, months, and years feel even shorter, because the more you live, the smaller that year is in comparison to the rest of your life.

Thanks for the lemonade 









 I've never heard of a lighter melting though.  I don't smoke and neither does my family, so that may be why.  It still strikes me as bizarre.  

If Olivia is a thing, and not just a series of freaky co-incidences, she seemed to be harmless up until seeking revenge for the insult.

Perhaps, to settle this, attempt to contact her again (sans-Ouija), and see if you get any kind of response.

To contact her without the Ouija (and please never use that thing again;  it invites evil spirits), gather everyone who has seen these events or been part in contacting her before (as best as you can; not necessarily the childhood friends, but the recent ones.), sit in a circle, relax as if to meditate together, then ask if she is there.  and take it from there.  IF she responds, then tell her you are sorry for insulting her (that should come from the friend who said the FU), and then maybe ask what she wants (but in a nice helpful way, do not say "WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?" ; say something like "Is there anything we can help you with so that you can rest in peace?"

I hope this is helpful; Let me know how it goes. 




 Coincidence or not, the gas and lighter is a dangerous situation. 




 I believe by vertical and horizontal op was talking about the way the bed was facing in the room, not that it was upright. 




 thank you :) 




 I love birds; I have pet birds.  

However, I have seen a negative entity once that presented itself to me as a dark bird.  So it's possible.

How high up is it?  Can you see it well?  Can you tell if it is just sitting there or if its looking at you specifically?  You said power-line, so I'm assuming you can't see its' features?  IF it were an entity of some sort, it would not have normal features.

the fact that your parents see it too may indicate that it is not a spirit, but then again, it could also indicate that whatever it is doing there involves all of you. 




 independent of your dad's experience in particular, to address the issue of sleep paralysis, it is very real, you can induce it on yourself, and it is fucking terrifying.  I have never done it myself, but I know people who have, and I once, last year, had a nightmare in which I was in sleep paralysis;  I was fully aware but couldn't move a muscle or speak.  That was the most terrifying dream I have ever had.  To experience that for real though must be so much worse.  The person I know who has done it was horrified by it as well. 




  not very exciting
um, you were pushed; I'd say that's pretty exciting.

The fact that your mom saw and experienced some of these things too is quite interesting. 




 well, difficulty communicating and adhering to societal norms is a disability for sure, although many other things lead people to the same problems.  Speech impediments, which are entirely physical, and shyness or even psychological disorders, like agoraphobia, which are entirely mental/chemical.  Its' classification as a disability makes it easier to get the therapy and assistance one needs to improve his or her ability to function in society.  Just like how Jewish became classified as a race despite being a religion; it helps legally with prevention of discrimination, making more laws applicable.  

So yes, it is an impediment; the symptoms, when isolated, are not necessarily pathological; the syndrome as a whole is though.  The degree of impediment is what varies.

That's just my perspective from my personal experience.  
My brother has grown out of a lot of his behavior/conformity to norms issues (by societal norms I mean understanding that you're supposed to be quiet in some situations, that he should tell an adult if he's going somewhere, that you say hello when someone comes in or you come in, and say goodbye when leaving and so forth).  Those are things that, delayed though it may be, you eventually learn (except in the extreme cases where the person is completely retreated into his or her own world).  

Learning to use speech to communicate also came with some maturity I think; to realize that he must put in the effort to train his vocal and oral muscles to make sounds properly in order to communicate to live life.  As a smaller child though, the importance of working on verbal communication is not fully graspable to someone who doesn't fully understand how social interactions work. 




 that's a good point; I never thought about it in practical terms, like applying it to the so called autism epidemic.  (I'm not saying there isn't one; I'm just saying I don't think it should be called an epidemic). 
My brother is autistic; but I never really tried to mind communicate with him much because I didn't want to run the risk of establishing a strong mind link, as I don't want him to be listening in on my thoughts randomly picking up on them, nor do I want to hear his. Especially now that he's getting older. 




 well now.  I think telepathy is also something we are all capable of, in terms of mind reading and mind communication.  Surely you've tried it at some point? 




 Pinky: "So what are we doing today?"

Brain: "The same thing we do everyday; try to take over the world!  I've figured out how we can actually do it.....*money*."

Pinky: "What do you mean?"

Brain: "Well the people in power get there by spending enough money, and once they're in power, corporations and interest groups pay them money to see things their way."

Pinky: "oh....what?  How does that help us?"

Brain: "we can use money to spread our message.  See, Net Neutrality laws have finally passed, which at first, I thought was great, because people will be able to see what we post on the web; we won't be censored or throttled into oblivion because big companies paid to have their sites load faster, or because other evil masterminds paid to have their page load faster than ours. "

Pinky: "..so how-"

Brain: "LET ME FINISH!  But, then I realized that, if there was no Net Neutrality, then *we* could use money to make our site the fastest most prominent site on the web.  We'll get all the attention we deserve.  SO WE CAN BRAINWASH THE WORLD!"

Pinky: "so how do we reverse net neutrality?"

Brain: "real simple: by getting people to vote *Republican*."

Pinky: "that's so crazy, it just might work!"

Brain: "we must also convince everyone that Net Neutrality is bad for them; that having the FCC regulating the internet will lead to restrictions and censorship."

Pinky: "so...you want to end Net Neutrality so that we can pay to be internet famous, with money we don't have, so that we can brainwash people; but to get there, we have to brainwash people?"

Brain: "PRECICELY!"

[by the way, a show I used to love as a kid, combined with a topic I am passionate about; I had to write one for you, although this is a devil's advocate pov...so I made it a satire :)] 




 ah ok; I got a more "born different/ with abilities" notion from the brief definition I read.  

Then, I agree with the term; seeing things differently with a more open mind.
