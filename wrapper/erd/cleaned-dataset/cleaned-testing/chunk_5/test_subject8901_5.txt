 POOOOOOORRRTAAAAAAATUUUUUU! 




 C'mon, man, you're only in your early thirties.  




 Be of putting down gun, Sergei. That fish do nothing wronk to you. 




 No, I'm a human *and* a sandwich. 




 With a tongue like that, I bet that lion was pretty popular with the lionesses. 




 I gave you another upvote, so now you have three upvotes which makes you dirty liar. 




 Vaccinations. Duh.  
  
Also, did you know Sasquatch single handedly increased chemtrails between 2000 and 2012 by more than 300%? Furthermore, it's suspected that the Illuminati have been the driving force behind Sasquatch's actions, providing him with the alien technology to efficiently spread mind-controlling substances via the skies. Open your eyes, sheeple! 




 Who gives a shit? Either way, he sucked and so did his sucky band. 




 Why would you upload of video of yourself failing so miserably? 




 Australia is of biggest cunt. 




 /r/twoguysdoingnothing 




 Give it a rest, buddy. 




 So is this really what /r/Pics has become? Is there any moderation at all? I dont have a problem with this incredible picture but why the fuck is it in r/r/Pics ? When i want to see an incredible outdoor view i will go to /r/Earthporn. I guess i expect more of what i assume is the biggest sub there is. Your sub is bad and you should feel bad. 




 "Hey, Antony, why were you looking at your own cum under the microscope?"  
  
"Because... science." 




 Too soon. 




 This cat has seen snow before. The picture just happened to be taken as it was meowing. I hate this. 




 I feel this graphic should have featured pie instead of a wheel.

FTFY 




 Definitely James Franco. 




 Oh, okay. 




 I like lines. 




 What is a "cat wall?" 




 /r/pareidolia 




 I did, and they said it was doggy-style. 




 It only takes one well-placed punch to knock a big fucker like him out. The hardest part for the little dude was reaching his chin with his fist. 




 My testicles. 




 Pretty much anything racist. 




 Masturbate.

 Why would you need to take a train when all of the streets are completely deserted? 




 The man who invented velcro was born in my hometown. There's even a velcro museum here that is named after him-- the Hans Velcrommen Velcro Museum. 




 Regina? That's about the only thing special about it. 




 I don't remember the album cover featuring a little old woman. 




 Thank you for the insightful comment. I'm sure I would miss it if you didn't post it. 




 Not really WTF. Just some medical stuff. However, if the brain had a massive tumour or was still connected to a cadaver, then you'd have some WTF gold. 




 If people are already committed to joining ISIS, this leaflet won't stop them unless someone already used that grinder to make pork sausages. 




 Some people eat hair. I don't know why, they just do. Hair doesn't digest and gets stuck in the stomach if too much is ingested. This picture shows what happens if you really like to chow down on pony tails and mullets. 




 I'd switch to watching C-SPAN all day if it meant seeing a booty like that. 









 It's a trilby, swag boy. 




 Corduroy jacket? Check. Wavy mullet? Check. Yep, this guy is definitely cool. 




 Have you ever walked down a hallway... ON MUSHROOMS?! 




 /r/trees 




 Poor-tugal. 




 Pull out, go to the bathroom, and fart. Don't poop in her presence. 




 I hope you're okay, man. Take 'er easy. 




 Peeing or ejaculating? 




 He'll be okay. 




 Fucking idiot. 




 Take that, asshole. 




 Thanks for all the Gold, Guys. Wow.

Gear down, big rig. This post has only been gilded twice. 




 I'd let her show me how to use my 120mm cannon. 




 Post a picture of you and your poop bag! For science, of course. 




 Plot twist: The lifetime ban has nothing to do with a lion heart. NewKeyboardGuy is just a public masturbator. 




 Good guess! I'm exactly 5'8", which is low-average for a man. 




 Good way to get rid of the competition. 




 This kills the piece of shit. 




 M'degree. 




 Where did the windows go? 




 How are you not dead? 




 Okay. 




 You mean he's a living anime. 




 Came here expecting to see a story about me. 




 I vote.

 They meant the wrinkles came free with the pants. 




 Stop commenting on my comments or I'll have you shadowbanned.  
  
How's that? 




 I remember spending $2000 on a laptop with 70GB of space. That, to me, was amazing. The rate at which we're able to continue cramming more and more data onto continuously shrinking devices is mind-blowing indeed. 




 /r/mildlyinteresting 




 And here I was using my ice cream scoop to relieve constipation like some sort of constipated idiot! Thanks, OP, I'll be sure to use your tip in the future! 




 /r/blep 




 Sure. Have one. 




 Game Genie? Pfft... noob. 




 On a scale from one to ten, this is wrong. 




 I'm a fat guy with a haircut. Does that mean I'm also Kim Jong Un? 




 Swag, yo. 




 Bonus points to OP if he pops all those pills and posts his reaction. 




 Please eat me, I'm hungry. 




 If you didn't care, you wouldn't have made such a dank meme. 




 OP, are you looking for a new band name? 




 SMILING POOP 




 I like butt gifs and I cannot lie. 




 Connor... what a sick bastard. 









 I wish I was paid by crows. 









 Well, I can't say I was expecting a response like that. I'm torn between thanking you for shedding light on the subject and deriding you for being the worst kind of sexual degenerate. 




 I hear that doing that gives you Brain Damage. 




 Sorry, this comment sucks at everything, yes i know you have buttseks with donkeys, but this still sucks. 




 I prefer Den Knee's. 




 She must give good head, because that shit is annoying. 




 Whew. I thought for sure she was stuck. 




 Isn't this what we're trying to *not* do? 




 Not only will you improve your posture and appear taller, but you'll also strengthen your back and core. 




 Wow, that's pretty tall but this is the internet, so you could be lying and I will never find out. However, you have an honest sounding name. I'll believe you this time. 




  wow, /b/ actually had a unified and genuine opinion  
  
The first and only time this will ever happen. 




 How tall are you, doug? 




 /r/teenageTIFU 




 Why don't Russia and Ukraine just switch countries? Then both would be happy! 




 You're right, I ain't never fucked a dwarf. 




 No need to point fingers. 




 Parents, please don't name your kid Alexa. This will inevitably happen to them if you do. 




 He's more than just an uncle now. 




 My Little Pony. Being attracted to animals is bad enough, but cartoon animals? Come on, cloppers, what are you thinking? What is going on there? Are these people also lusting after real-life barnyard-type ponies too? 




 Full-body insertion is highly discouraged for the first time you try anal. 




 You forgot poop on floor. 




 A can within a can. Canception. 




 /r/atheism 




 Boo!!! Booooo!!! Take your shit post elsewhere! 




 You could fit my house in your bedroom. 




 What he didn't win was the award for sportsmanship. 




 Can't say she didn't deserve it. 




 Good on her.  




 It's people like you who make my puny mines and one-storey houses look like a crappy waste of time. 




 That family is nothing more than Vienna Sausage to those lions. Just pull the tab on the door and their meaty goodness is revealed. 




 Pup-sta Rhymes. 




 He was my favourite too! There was something really satisfying about watching his fat body flip ass-over-tea kettle.  




 A werewolf that fights bears? The movie script writes itself! 




 Updates, OP! Hurry! 




 I think that's the joke. 




 He's can't help being such a softy. 




 I'll just stand here in the middle of this busy highway. What could go wrong?
