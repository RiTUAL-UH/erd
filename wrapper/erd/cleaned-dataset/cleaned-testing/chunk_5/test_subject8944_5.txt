 That's horrible legal advice. Look at the source it came from. That's like asking your opponent in a football game what you should do and they say "fumble the ball and let me score a TD." 




 The downfall is that many of the kids in the program are there because there were ordered by the court to be, as in they are generally troublemakers and there are lots of reports of stealing. Not to discourage you. It's actually a great opportunity. I'm just trying to give you all the information. 




 Well damn. All right, let's do a breakdown. You have $1000, plus $400 on Amazon. Do you mind saying what city you live in? You need to be in a place with good public transportation (even if you get the car, b/c gas is expensive), that is cheap, and has jobs.

Step 0) Sell everything you don't need. This includes the guitar, excess clothes, everything. If you absolutely cannot part with stuff you cannot carry on your back, you need to find one of those storage rental places that gives you your first month for $1 or some great deal like that. But be careful not to sign a contract for longer than that period. If you end up needing longer than the month, 

1) Do you have a laptop? If so, you need to find places with free wifi. Usually McDonalds have free wifi so look there first.

2) Get a library card to waste time, read, and use their computers.

3) The $400 on Amazon is now your food money. They have Amazon lockers that you can get your items shipped to so you don't need an address. Buy small items that can fit in your backpack, and shop cheap.

4) Join a gym. Usually YMCA will give you a membership based on income. Check there first. This is now where you shower, shave, etc.

5) If you don't get the car, you need a place to sleep. Homeless shelters can probably be nasty and dangerous. If I were you, I would buy just an absolute junker of a car off Craigslist to at least sleep in. You can probably get one for $300. If you don't want to do that, start researching nearby shelters. I hear Walmarts are good at letting people sleep in their parking lots, but don't take that to the bank. Otherwise try to find deserted areas that don't look too dangerous. Warning: Don't sleep in the storage locker listed above. It's probably illegal and there are all sorts of dangers of freezing/heating to death, not to mention lack of oxygen if its airtight, etc.

6) Do you have a cell phone? Will your mom continue to pay for the plan? If not, then go buy one of those cheap phones with the pay as you go minutes and only buy the minimum and never text anyone. This is strictly for work contacts.

7) You need an address to put on job applications and where you can receive mail. Buy a PO Box from UPS. They have ones that look like real street addresses (http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/personal.aspx).

8) Now you have all your immediate needs out of the way. And honestly all the above steps shouldn't take you more than 2 days. Now you start job searching. Apply everywhere. You cannot discriminate. It's already likely going to be 2-3 weeks before your first paycheck arrives. Fastfood places generally have high turnover. Put on a button-up shirt if you have one and make your hair look good. You walk in and ask if the hiring manager is working and tell them you'd like to apply. Another good place to apply would be CVS or Walgreens, basically small drug stores. They also generally have high turnover. And this is actually a good time to be applying. There's not a lot of competition from high school/ college students like there is in summer.

9) After you get a job, you want to get a place. Don't waste time finding an apartment you can't afford right now. Go find a rent a room situation on Craigslist. Shouldn't be more than $500 including all bills. And make sure its a month-to-month situation.

10) Now you can start looking at community colleges. I'd start with 1-3 classes you can take when you're not working. Seriously, college goes faster than you know. Think of it as 40 classes. That's all you need to graduate from a 4 year college. Or even start looking at trade professions your community college may offer if you're interested. You already applied to FAFSA, great!! Take any aid offered. Aim to start this summer! You'll be done in just a few years. If you want to transfer to a 4 year college, do your first 60 credits (20 classes at community college) before you transfer. If you take 3 classes each term, and don't skip summers, you'll be done in 2 years + 1 semester. That can be your Associate Degree or your step to transfer to a Bachelors.


While my situation wasn't as dire as yours, I went through something similar, getting kicked out, on 1 weeks notice, when I was 18 and still in high school. I ended up working and taking community college classes for some years before transferring to a 4 year school and graduating with a double major. I'm now on a full scholarship to law school with a fiance and a cat. I'm telling you this so you can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better if you put in the effort. Feel free to respond on here or PM me if you have any other questions.


EDIT: Just saw you lived in rural Pennsylvania. That can't work. You need to get to the closest big city. It looks like Philadelphia is the biggest city in Pennsylvania by a lot. So you need to get there before any of these steps can happen. Try to get a ride from your mom since she's moving, but if not you need to use a tiny bit of your money to buy a bus ticket there.

EDIT 2: Just saw someone from Philadelphia say the job market sucks there. I looked up the lowest unemployment rates in the US and Salt Lake City, Utah is at the top with an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But they have a very small population. The city on the list with the highest population and lowest unemployment rate is Minneapolis, Minnesota or Austin, Texas. I looked at a Greyhound ticket and they're $108 from Philadelphia to Minneapolis or $139 to Austin. They are both big cities with low unemployment rates under 5%. 




 Do you have any interest at all in the military?

I'm not a huge proponent of the military, but you are low on options and they will provide you with food, housing, medical, salary and seemingly most important to you, some structure in life.

Plus you can learn a skill that might be applicable when you get out. 




 For anyone on mobile where it's a pain in the ass to get to, the nickname is Cuddly Bear. 




 I assumed it would be unranked schools, but it's Iowa (27th) and SUNY Buffalo (100th to be fair).

The article suggests this is the ABA no longer requiring the LSAT for up to 10% of each school's entering class and that more schools will soon follow. Article also suggests that schools will likely lobby the ABA for an even higher percentage of students to be allowed in without LSAT scores.

This is all due to dropping enrollment, which dropped another 7% from last year.

The schools will require the students' SAT/ACT, GRE, GMAT, or other standardized college scores in place of the LSAT. 









 Planning on going to 187 so this is easy.

Edit: I'd obviously buy the UFC to record at home so I can hope to catch myself going nuts. 




 That's it. I'm buying tickets. 




 More like, "dude I have this great deal where you'll make $20. Sign this contract real quick." 




 Not now they won't because they still wouldn't have the votes to override a presidential veto. Now if they get a Republican president and still have a House majority but only between 51-59 Senators, I would highly suspect they would do just what you say. 




 He's also going for his 16th Zuffa win in a row, same record Anderson set. 




 His case got reviewed by the Supreme Court. It's over. There's no one else to appeal to. I think I'd be happier running and always looking over my shoulder than spending my time in prison. 




 I agree 100%, but that does not mean that the decision to do something detrimental to your health would not be a stupid decision. Do you agree with the suicide hypothetical I posted above? 




 Surprisingly good. I like how they're taking their time to set up for the long run. Taking it kind of slow, but have some powerful scenes so far. 




 Those people are pretty stupid. Yes, there are a few that won't get addicted after doing heroin for a week, but I'd argue that the health effects of that week alone are enough to make it stupid, much less the likely possibility that you aren't one of the few chosen ones who will get addicted. 




 Right. And I'm saying that it's pretty stupid to likely ruin your life for that chance. 




 Not at all. If you just filmed it and the after-effects, it would serve about the same impact as this heroin experiment. 




 That's not my hypothetical though. It was only what happened here, which is someone doing something extremely detrimental to themselves for a CHANCE they will prevent others from doing the same. 




 I realize that. I'm saying it's pretty much one of the stupidest things someone could do. You've agreed that it is analogous to someone killing themselves if it prevents others to do so. I also think that's insanely stupid. But according to you, that could NEVER be stupid if you do it with the intention of the public good in mind. I think that's a pretty stupid idea. 




 So you are completely agreeing with the suicide hypothetical. 




 You are effectively arguing that if someone does something that is bad for themselves but prevents the general public from doing that thing then it's not stupid. So if this guy were to kill himself instead, say gunshot to the head for example, and that prevented others from killing themselves after they saw how sad his family was, then that wouldn't be stupid, right? 




 What part of purposely getting addicted to heroin do you not find stupid? 




 It was a personally stupid idea to knowingly do one of the most addictive drugs on the planet. 




 Let the door hit you in the face on your way out. 




 I'm sorry but how stupid can you be to think that's a good idea? 




 The Way Way Back, The Spectacular Now, The To Do List, and of course Boyhood. 




 Someone said 17 year old and that it was consensual. 




 That's like a scandal over jaywalking. 




 Looks like I'm redditing mobily from now on. 




 I'm sure that's exactly how it would go but I'd at least be able to prepare some sort of defense compared to the other two options. 




 Never beach and move from hotel to hotel every week. 




 Where so I can just never go there. 




 Typically not. Instead they will track the market rental rate in their area and when the current lease is up, the renewal rate will be at market rent. This sometimes correlates with interest rate increases, but is not caused from these increases, if that makes sense. 




 It's part of Obama's budget proposal. But the cap has not passed yet. Also, it seems it would be interpreted to mean that it would only apply to new borrowers. 




 If it's a phone, you just don't go on wifi. 




 Do you pet them? I'm just unclear on what you do with the wolves? Just looking?

As someone semi-new to the area, I've never been around a wolf and have no clue what to do/expect. 




 Looks like an even dopier version of Eli Manning behind Bones. 




 I always see these kind of pictures from up north and think "Gee, it sure would be wonderful to live there," but then I remember you guys actually have winters and how I walked outside in shorts today here in San Diego. 




 Ah, that makes a lot of sense then. 




 I don't believe his cut has been released for anyone besides BJ, but correct me if I'm wrong.

Also he works with lesser known fighters all the time and I'm fairly certain they are not paying him more than they make. 




 There's no way Dolce charges that to the lower tier guys. 




 3rd year law student. 




 Your landlord has a specific clause in the lease stating you can't replace your door with one with a lock? That right there should have been a red flag.

You should inquire as to why you are not allowed to secure your things and if you can change that part of the lease, as your safety/wellbeing is being affected. 




 Get a lock for your door. $15 and 10 minutes to install. 




 Damn. I even looked on the front page and just must have missed it. 




 I'm inclined to agree that Rumble is best based on what we've seen of his power in his last few fights. But I kinda feel like he's ranking Rashad above DC and Gus just because he likes to make those to feel bad because of all the crap they've talked recently.

I do agree with his DC over Gus though. 









 I have no idea about Australian law, but I'll give general life advice. Do you have proof she forced you to write the note to her, such as texts, email, or voicemail? If so it seems unlikely to hold up.

I also am unsure of the damage responsibility.

However if I were you, and were scared for my pets life, I would lie and tell her I had the money and that I will meet her in public with the money if she brings the dog then just take it from her in as harmless way as possible. Let her call the police and attempt to sue you and deal with that later but your first priority should be keeping your pet safe from a seemingly psychotic person. 




 Thank you so much! 




 Thanks, I really appreciate it. 




 Why do you see so many fighters there? Are you in Vegas or LA? 




 I did call at about 2pm today and those were the only options available. 




 Yea that's definitely not what I'm saying. 




 It only gives me the option to say I'm calling about a refund, which is the option I've been selecting, or an amended 1040X. Should I just select the 1040X option? 




 And in the absence of any contenders, would you agree someone could justifiably get a title shot in a new division? 




 I can see the difference. However, my point is that you are recognizing that someone can earn a title shot in a division they do not have any wins in.

You are not refuting this point.

I'm merely extending the point to #1 contenders who just lost. 




 See that's my point. If you are agreeing that someone, ANYONE, could be entitled to a title shot based on their performance in another weightclass, then why not a #1 contender who just lost? I mean to become a #1 contender, they obviously had to have some pretty high level wins, so they are likely going to be competitive in the new weightclass, just as a champion would have. 




 What about the JBJ part? 




 Really? Why not, because he has no wins at MW?

What about if JBJ wanted to go up/down to HW/MW for his next fight? Would he also not deserve a shot because of no fights at HW/MW? 




 Dude. Many people believe Frankie beat Bendo in the 2nd fight and thus was arguably better than the 155 champ. Yea, he didn't earn the fight at FW, but he more than earned it with his wins at LW.

Let me put it this way: if Cormier, who just lost againt JBJ wanted to (and physically could) drop down to MW, do you really think he wouldn't be worthy of an immediate shot at Weidman? 




 WHERE DO YOU WORK? 




 I filed my taxes in January 2014 for the 2013 tax year. My refund never came and when I went to Where's My Refund, it said it was still "in process" or something along those lines. After 10 weeks or so, I figured I got audited but I had nothing to worry about. In June, I called up the IRS (forgot what number I called or how I found it) and was told that they were indeed auditing me and that they would contact me before August. That came and went with no contact from them, and I got busy with school. Well now it's January and I need to file this years return but I kinda want to know the status on last years return (and get my refund).

So when I got on Where's My Refund now, it thinks I'm entering for tax year 2014 and doesn't work anymore. And if I call the (800) 829-1040 number I found, it keeps prompting me for SSN, refund amount and filing status, but when I enter those it asks when I filed my tax return, either before January 5th, 2015 or after. When I select before, it just says they haven't processed those yet, but obviously they're thinking of this years tax return and I'm thinking of last years.

Please can someone point me in the right direction?

 I mean the definition of perjury is lying under oath so yes he would be. 




 That's exactly my point. Kuhn stands out from the other fullbacks. 




 How many better FBs can you name? 




 Haha same here bro, same here. 




 I mean I get that, but in the article it says Peyton's earned $230MM. I don't follow Peyton's life too much, but I'm sure he lives in a house he's probably paid $20MM or so for, and lives on mayyyybbee $1MM or so each year he's been in the league. After accounting for taxes, which should be about 40% or so, that leaves him with a little over $100MM left, assuming he had no investments whatsoever. Now what in the world would PFM want to buy that he could with $120MM but not $100MM. It just makes no sense. I mean if he invested in US Bonds, yielding some of the lowest interest rates, he'd be nearly guaranteed $2MM each year for the rest of his life.

tl;dr: If he comes back, it's not for the money. 




 What do you think Peyton would want right now that he can't afford but an extra $19MM will allow him to afford and is worth the risk of another severe injury?

If I had as much money as him, I would retire yesterday from a sport as dangerous as his. 




 Unless OP's name is Larry. 




 I nominate Court McGee for best response. 




 Oh you almost certainly have nothing to worry about. Here's a study on births by pregnancy week. Basically anything past 43 weeks would be extremely rare and a doctor would almost certainly induce by week 41.

http://spacefem.com/pregnant/charts/duedate3.php 




 We are in agreement that OP should get the test.

However over a 9 month block, months certainly do work on averages. Pick any 9 month block and it will be closer to 40 weeks than 36 weeks. 




 Months are 4.33 weeks on average, so it's actually much closer to 9 months than 10. 




 As someone who uses adblock, I think you should put a small banner at the top of the site that explains this, because now that I know, I will disable adblock for your site. 




 That reasoning doesn't make sense. An interception on 4th and a fumble on 4th down are still turnovers. 




 I don't know him personally. I hung out with him for an hour or two. 




 When Tim did his AMA and came on here asking if any redditors wanted to help, I responded. Me and another dude went to Tim's house and played with his dogs and we helped type up his AMA as he dictated. He gave us both plenty of signed gear and invited us to a BJJ seminar he was doing the next day. Pretty cool dude. 




 Oh man I completely forgot it was vacant. 




 LOL I was getting downvoted for that?

Such is life in /r/MMA  




 A couple things to note. 1) Johny was injured when Lawler was climbing his way back up so an immediate rematch wasn't possible. 2) A contender losing and getting the rematch is pretty unprecedented (only happened with Shogun/Machida), whereas a champion losing and getting an immediate rematch happens all the time and is even more justified because the result was controversial


For the record I disagree with the rematch. I think Rory should get the fight. 




 The federal govt will just give them to you. No need for you to shop around. Don't go private, or you lose all sorts of repayment benefits.

 If you verified there was a problem with the handle it seems likely they weren't lying.

Just keep that in mind when making your offer. 




 I think that's more 1/3 




 Is this what Leo was talking about in that scene in Django? 




 LOL. No, you signing the wrong name on the contract won't hold up in court. You would lose that argument 100/100 times. 




 W-what is this? 




 Yea, that's not gonna hold up in court. 




 When you say fill in the missing parts, do you just mean stuff your teacher mentions that the outline did not have, or do you just keep the main headings of the outline and fill in all the information?

 Apparently dude just got out of jail. 




 Would Rodgers be Iron Man? 




 Said wrestler was supposedly right around 200 pounds, so 12 pounds is 6% of his bodyweight. 5 pounds for Nate at 160 is just over 3%. 




 Sorry to hijack here, but I just saw Foxcatcher tonight where Channing Tatum is a wrestler and the weigh ins happens, and the dude telling Channing he's 12 pounds over. Mark Ruffalo asks dude how much time they have and he says 90 minutes. I started busting out laughing cause the next scene is Channing biking his ass off on a stationary with a sweatshirt on, and apparently he makes weight cause it shows him fighting the next scene. No idea if that part was based on a real story but it was unreal.

Point being, if that wrestler could do it, Nate could. 




 Cause it's 12/12 




 Who would you vote for instead if Hillary ended up being Dem candidate? 




 That actually brings up a very interesting point. Like right now, if you have a fight coming up in the next 3-4 months its whatever, you'll fight either way. But if they try to schedule you for an event in May/June, would you just get "injured" and not be able to fight until July? I mean really, how many sponsors are gonna stick around until the very last minute? It just makes sense to try to delay at that point. 




 Where you at motherfucker?!? Don't be scared! 




 I still stand by my statement than anyone with multiple MVP seasons is a HOFer. I don't care if they only played 2 seasons. I think that alone deserves HOF, but I realize people will disagree with me.

Also, a SB win, SB MVP, and 3 SB appearances. I mean that's better than 99% of all QB's. I definitely feel Warner has earned HOF.


Edit: Let me give you a hypothetical because I'm curious. Say a QB came into the league and had most yards ever in a season, highest completion percentage ever, most TD's in a season, least INTs ever in a season, lead his team to a perfect record and won SB MVP. Then the next season he had identical stats and record, but promptly retired after those 2 seasons. Would you think he deserved HOF then? 




 In your position, I would do night school if you want to finish your degree. Also, since you're moving soon, you should wait until you qualify for in-state tuition.

Also, welcome (soon) to San Diego! I think it hit 80 today. I got hot walking around in a light jacket. Also, people freak out when it rains at all and forget how to drive. 




 Let me guess. Punitive damages, jury trial? 




 This 2014 season. Nearly everyone has him leading.

Also, Warner is looking like a first ballot HOFer, so I don't see how that's a good argument. Yes, there's argument, but if he doesn't make this cut, he'll almost surely be in within the next few years. 




 They said it last week, when they had Pats #1 after they JUST lost to the Packers. I believe it was something along the lines of "I know how good the Patriots are and nothing I saw in this game changes that."
