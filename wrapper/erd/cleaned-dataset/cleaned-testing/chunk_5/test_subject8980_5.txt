 You're welcome :)
I make music like this all the time, so keep your eyes peeled for more if you're interested.  




 Yes, I'd love that :)
Please just credit me as the original creator in your description or something though. 









 I know that feel. 
When you're stuck against a wall and by yourself, you're nothing more than a snack to a much larger ball, but then some idiot who has no ability to perceive size comes over to try and eat you, even though he's essentially the exact same size as you and has no hope of eating you. This making you seem like less of a snack and more of a delicious 2 course meal for the large ball floating right above you who now decides you're worth splitting for because this other dumb ass who came over and made you look more worthwhile.
