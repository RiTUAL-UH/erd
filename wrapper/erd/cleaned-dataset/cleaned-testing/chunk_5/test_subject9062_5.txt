 Next mail to the Ayatollah will probably be bibles and Walmart gift cards.  














 Yeah, this really just requires a collective "WELL DUH, VLAD"

In a few more months we'll see a headline saying that he shot that dude in the back, right?  




 One of the good guys. This stuff is not new; my grandfather was an OB/GYN and used to travel to indian reservations to delivery babies. There have always been people who are NOT bigots, not racists. The line we are fed about the times changing...really what's changing is whether we accept that status quo or challenge it en masse.  









 It's a gun thing, not a pot thing. Take the pot away, and the gun could still kill ya.  



























































 This is the third incident involving children and guns since Friday in the Houston area.
 









 ^^ End of story.  









 Just local NRA chapter head.  




 A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.

Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.

Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.

Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said. 














 Kyle T. Dodds was treated for a gunshot wound at the Nebraska Medical Center and booked into the Sarpy County Jail for attempted first-degree assault, making terroristic threats, felony child abuse and use of a weapon to commit a felony.
Just before midnight Bellevue police were called to 4128 Bartmann Dr. and learned that Dodds was intoxicated and armed with a rifle. Also inside the home were a woman and two young children, said Officer Laurie Synowiecki, a Bellevue police spokeswoman. 
























 Blame the unnamed contractor. Contractors are the new interns.  














 Her Facebook page is filled with Bible verses, and information about organizing for the Republican Party.  



















 Oddly similar to how the  GOP caters to billionaires but keeps its own supporters half-witted and clueless.  




 So no cell phones, but ISIS can tweet and create video montages of massacres? These fuckers flip flop like politicians.  







































 Yep. Looks like the news will either blame atheism or progressivism, and not the gun that killed the three. No fucking surprise.  









 "My sister had a right to life," said Jane Dougherty of Littleton, whose sibling was killed at Sandy Hook. "My sister had a right to grow old. ... Nobody ever died from a background check." 














 That picture reads like something out of a trailer park or an open carry Texas rally. Teabillies are the same all over the world!  







































 It's a weird thing to feel awkward about though - it's the RIGHT thing to do, even though it's easily mocked and scoffed at. What's better - giving out money? Giving out fast food? Or giving out healthy food?  




 This divide-and-conquer could result in deaths. Rand Paul should step down. This is very dangerous misinformation that puts the public at dire risk.  




 This is incredibly dangerous, and he should be forced to resign. Unfit to serve if he can't grasp basic science. This is seriously KILLING PEOPLE; I have a tiny niece who is too young to have received the measles vax. And pregnant friends; anyone know what happens to a fetus if mom gets rubella? FUCK THIS SHIT. Rand Paul is a fucking ignorant info-terrorist and should not hold any public office.  




 Holy shit. he should step down; that shows a profound lack of understanding of basic science. UNFIT TO SERVE.  












































 Coloradans bought 36,666 guns last month, according to the states background check report. 


Horror.  









 Worried that the fighting might escalate further and knowing that guns and ammunition were around the house, the 14-year-old started gathering what she could find to hide it.

"(The girl) said all the guns were in easily accessible places," the complaint said. "(She) said that, fearing one of her parents would pick up a gun and use it against the other, she tried to grab all the guns and ammunition. (She) said she put the guns/ammunition she could gather into her bedroom, to get them away from her parents."

Police searched the home and found five guns that belonged to Wright, according to the complaint. A Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith   Wesson AR 5 rifle were in a child's room. 
 



















 To be fair, that was some sweet honeyed dick.  




 Same-same. But different.  




 Same here. I thought of my own child when he accidentally spills something and says "Sorry mom, I spilled my drink"...and how this kid said "I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin." 

The adults surrounding those two boys failed them both. I hope the five year old gets massive support and counseling, but I fear that's not something you ever get over. God damnit.  









 I see stories like this daily, but this one wrecks me. Where is the nationwide PSA? Where are the safe storage laws being demanded by the survivors?? Where is the accountability here? This five year old's life is forever damaged.
