 Do you have any idea how disappointing it was that there aren't any misspellings in your bio?  




 I wonder if there's cider on the sun.

 She's looking at the sodas. She's already had a taste of some Rainbow.  









 /r/scifi or /r/oldschoolcool.  




 Thirty years minimum, dude. Not twenty.  









 I've seen numerous people bash the movie on the basis the plot is full of action movie cliches. It was bewildering.  




 No Urotsukidoji? Bah! 









 Tried to die, but I failed.  




 News from 2016: Star Wars Most Disappointing Movie of 2015.  




 I know it's clearly not what happens in this movie, but wouldn't it be amazing to have a movie where we never see the main character's face? Just all POV shots, silhouettes, or shots where his/her face is obscured.   




 Personally, he's the guy from OZ, a million audio books, and the History Channel. One of my favorite voices ever.  









 I have never gone through a list of bombs and thought "good" so many times.  




 Do you ever get contacted by people that want you to sell their dowsing stuff?

Some of them are way the hell more creepy than others, and I'm sure many people would switch them around even if they were told they had to keep these ten. But there's a few on there I'm glad I saw.  




 Not really. It's kind of forced in it's creepiness (the use of b w is a dead giveaway to me that they're trying to be creepy rather than make porn.) It's also nothing like the short story, and the author of the short story called the site lame: http://gadgets.gunaxin.com/interview-nes-godzilla-author/173878 




 I'll say Psychosis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YugLGMYX030

I think the pacing is great if nothing else, even though it's a long one.  














 "Does sad mean 'goofy' on this planet?"  




 You... think wolves are pretty dumb, don't you?  









 I know calling us autistic or aspies is something countless people online can't go ten minutes without doing, but this is a sincere questions without malice. /u/ScalSaver noticed some points in a recent thread about the character: 

she doesn't pick up on facial cues quickly, if at all.
but she doesn't quite get that other ponies don't know what she knows (= bad theory of the mind)
She has difficulty understanding what other ponies are thinking.


That seems a pretty reasonable case, whether or not it's intentional. 




 It's just part of being a libertarian. Doesn't matter what movie it is: You don't want tax dollars to go to it being preserved.  




 I had to wait a damn month after accidentally seeing that my brother bought me a twelve pack of cream soda. She can wait for her birthday cake.  




 Is there an ideal way to read Only Revolutions? I remember chancing upon that in the library, opening it, seeing how it was formatted, and then immediately reshelving it.  




 So that's what... fifteen that have ever jammed? 


jk 




 What? It has made less than half of its budget. How is that 75% of what it needs to break even? Now a lot of the hype has died off and bad word of mouth is spreading.  









 Most of these are more silly that creepy.  




 That is some objectivist horseshit there. 

"Duh, me one of those dumb blue collar guys that never should aspire to better. Me in right place. You exceptional: You should be in better, right place."   




 It's a prequel about how Wooderson is Mason's real dad.  




 Only on Facebook.  




 In the history books. The person on the street, after France, China, the Japanese, and then the Americans called it "this shit again."  




 My brother insists that Pinkie Pie works better when she's actually a kind of compassionate being. She's supposed to be so desperate for parties and fun because it's the only way she knows to try to make others happy. That's why it's supposed to be so important to her when she gets her cutie mark that her family like her party set up, and that if she only cared so much about candy and stuff she could have just entertained herself. That's also why when no one's around she goes so crazy. 

I argued that it makes her too much of a goody-goody and that she needs to have some selfishness and such. She's also kind of stunted and oblivious at the end of the day, and she'd be less compelling if she's so selfless.  




 That's when it gets the hose again.  




 I was just listening to an interview about Big Eyes, the movie about those Keane paintings, and they were talking about how Keane was supposed to have both started the idea of selling the story behind the art, not just the piece itself (also there's that commercialism of art aspect.) I've also heard this said about Van Gogh and such. So what pieces rely totally on their intrinsic merits and we have no idea who made them or under what context they were made?  




 Is she the one that was interviewed on First Person?  




 The true mark of quality, I guess. 

I've heard before the internet, Clerks was supposed to be the most stolen movie. Does anyone know if that's true? 









 Please excuse me if this feels too cynical or too focused on business for this subreddit, but I've got a manuscript I will soon have edited and if I cannot interest a publisher in it, then I'll have to do this. 
 




 I and a friend just got into an argument about Ready Player One. I looked for someone to back me up online and was surprised to learn that there were relatively few reviews that had my back on this. 

You had any books where you had that feeling recently?  














 I don't know, this just doesn't seem creepy to me. It's more like sad or unpleasant.  









 http://listverse.com/2014/12/28/10-creepypastas-adapted-into-even-creepier-short-films/

Warning: a few of them are based on those video game horror stories that I think even Creepypasta fans think are pretty bad. At least one of those is a parody, one's short, and the third one's kind of okay.  




 Why is Scootaloo mad? 
 




 Just your magic to slightly lift yourself up when you're on the scale. It works for me.  




 It's the "already famous for it" that makes me laugh the most. The thought that the guy not only is famous, but his girlfriend doesn't know about it and random people are aware of how fast his rise to prominence has been.  




 Do people give you guff about reinforcing gender stereotypes by associating female players with pink or something like that?  




 So she gets killed by it too? 

Alright, which generation clone is Pinkie by now?  




 I was just wondering with my friend how much The Interview would have just made Youtube and how that cut compares to a movie theater.  




 I haven't seen any of these. But I'm going to change that pretty substantially this weekend!  




 So how much of a percentage would Youtube have taken from that?  



















 Anything of yours available on Youtube in authorized postings?  









 He'll be sure to cut in enough new scenes to make it six hours long.  




 I was watching Reefer Madness: The Musical. There's this scene where the main character's love interest is shot in the chest and she's bleeding out. The guy is cradling her in his arms and she reprises an earlier song "We are just like Romeo and Juliet. We're happy, young, and * Cough * Hemorrhaging blood." Now obviously the movie is deliberately goofy, their relationship is clearly unhealthy, and the lyrics are silly. Really, I imagine audience members would usually hate the character singing by design. But I actually welled up when I heard that line being sung. My only excuse is that Kristen Bell is a very good singer and all that, but damn, I bet it would have gotten a laugh if in the movie there had been a cut to a close up of someone watching that scene.  




 Aren't there four artists for it? 

Also yes, I thought it was shit from the first comic.  




 I think it's the fact he went alone that made it awkward.  














 NOTE: You don't have to agree that it was a sexist movie, it just has to be one where you would have thought people would complain about it. 

I was archive binging and read an old review about Clerks and I was surprised that it hadn't occurred to me that its gender politics are kinda questionable, especially since the indie film world that made Kevin Smith's name is so attached to progressives: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239

Any other movies where you're surprised more people didn't talk about that?
 




 Saturn 3. I don't think it's remembered enough to be hated, let alone popular.

 Aren't those 16 mm film projections?  




 Well, you drive under the zip line, you're going to get this kind of thing! 









 Challenge accepted: Sombity.  




 I've had an insanely good year at the movies, since the worst I saw by far was Maze Runner.  




 That's more Talmud than Christian bible.  




 These characters are supposed to be idealists, not out for money. They want to actually treat patients.  









 Isn't it common knowledge now that buying a new car is one of the worst investments you can make and you'll lose thousands of dollars driving it off the lot?  




 I know it's a stereotype that FA people idealize the idea of having a relationship to an insane extent, but I had a reaction that I think was an example of this that I think most people would think was pretty funny.

So yeah, there's a real "that guy needs a girlfriend" moment for you. Yours?   




 I know that cancer is actually many diseases that sort of get lumped into one category. Let's just say one that would be most feasible for a small, underground organization to make.

This is for a story I'm working on in case you're wondering. Profit margin isn't really an issue since the characters involved are driven by ideology. Also the characters are intended to be chemists themselves and thus can steal and bribe to get materials not normally available.

Thanks for your time.
 














 Yeah, I'm freshly arrived from /r/foreveralone, but this is something I've seen in porn a few times and I've been kind of curious about it lately. To me the stuff smells kinda unpleasant, but some people insist that there's something to the smell of sweat too, so what do I know?  




 Sorry, OOP apparently meant to post this as the source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W78pPCtt9d8 




 So? Why should women lower their standards?  




 Being Dilbert probably doesn't help.  




 Still better than the results of when Pinkie claimed she was super skilled at making cupcakes.  




 Another bad breakup, I'm guessing. 









 He could really relate to the scene where Mason took someone's McCain '08 sign. 




 Or at least one comic artist is not likely to enjoy it.  




 That's what Tia has been rated?  




 I... am... not... a... gun.  




 The situation she's in now is way creepier than she is.  









 Deleted scene from The Room.  




 Sorry, but the sped up foot movements still look kind of silly. I don't know how to make that work, though. Maybe the actress had to be weighed down so that when she ran, it looked more like she's actually running.

 That's at least forty cents too little! 




 Didn't one of those old games with the ludicrously bad cut scenes have you play as Zelda for it?  









 This is more like an anecdote than a rant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKbAEmvZyKQ unless he went on about him on Smodcast or something else I haven't seen.  




 The comment section on that article is hysterical if you're obsessed with the Simpsons.  




 Well, that's a bit much for being annoyed by overexposure to something they don't like.  




 Because it's such a well-known film, I hear it bashed pretty often. This  is particularly by parents who are sick of their kids watching it. Online of course there's a lot of bile for it too. I feel compelled to defend it a bit for the reason given in the title, but of course it would kind of be a waste of time. 

Blargh.   




 I think it would be funny for there to be a character in MLP that is actually happy with being alone and Pinkie kinda butts up against the idea (unlike with Cranky where he was unhappy with his loneliness and turned it into bitterness.) 









 This is just CG?  




 So AJ and AB are way closer in age than I would have thought?  




 I don't get this. Is this a reference to something another performer did? Or is it just that a character on a children's show is being unpleasant?  




 Are the guest rappers worth checking out? I found out about Dan Bull from the Jack the Ripper rap and became a bit of a fan.  




 It's unlikely that some of them will be accessible in your area, but I heavily recommend these: http://thedissolve.com/features/2014-in-review/851-the-best-2014-films-that-made-under-100000/ 




 I think Visitor Q is less terrifying and more just disgusting. It's like being scared by Pink Flamingos.  









 It's a what now?

 If you have the time, don't pass up an opportunity to check out Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner. It's about three hours long and totally worth it.  




 Cum aboard, we're expecting you. 
Love, life's sweetest reward. 
Let it flow, it floats back to you.  




 Back then doing just about anything was a bitch, so you just got used to it and plowed ahead on.  




 Wait, there's a male option? Huh, TIL.  




 My fanfic to be adapted into an episode. 

This time when I mailed it to them, I wrote "Please" at the bottom. How could they resist that?  




  Oh, and while all that was going on, Fluttershy had an orgy of gore.

 You really could just take any arbitrary photo and write a "story" like this about it.  









 I thought 7 was The Toolbox Murders. 

 




 If someone knows the source for this, please share it. No one seemed to know it at the other posts.   









 That's really cool! 




 It's a hardcore Smith purist traveling back from the future to prevent Clerks II and III.

 Has her highness developed resting bitch face?  




 Huh, I didn't know Hank Azaria was a Disney animator.  




 Britain waives the rules.  




 Obviously it barely matters that the characters in MLP are horses, but just around the time I was joining the herd I got a quick gig feeding and watering horses for a family. They really weren't that nice, with only the oldest one being willing to let me pet it at all or anything. 

One thing that stands out in my memory about that gig was one night it got horribly cold, like -7. I lost a bit of sleep worrying about how cold they'd be in their stables. Then I showed up and let them out for their feeding, and one of them started rolling around in the snow. I should have been she was okay, but I remember being pissed that I'd  been worrying about this horse and then it felt like she was unwittingly rubbing in my face what a waste that worry had been.  



















 So is this an illustration from one of those Rainbow Dash books that Daring Do is so obsessed with?  




 Oh my god, as much as I feel prostitution should be legal so that it can be regulated and all that, this sentence made me laugh so hard. I just imagine them all convening on wherever the meeting point was at once, maybe carpooling.  




 Their comedy sucks ass and in PDP's case his personality seems so calculated and horrible that it's sickening.  




 Oh hell no, Furries are fine with me. It's guys like PewDiePie fans or TheSw1tcher fans that are fans of something I can't stand.  




 Learning that there's a lot of overlap with it and fandoms I loathe.  




 Worst part: Mr. Edwards thought he *had* dressed up as Rarity.

 Did you try to join an App team for a major company at some point?  




 How did it go?  




 I'm not saying I'm above it or anything. I just know from second hand experience that of course relationships don't solve all your ills. I have to imagine anyone that would settle for me would probably come to resent me pretty quickly. I'm probably not mature enough to adjust to a relationship and at twenty-eight it's probably a bit too late.  

Not that I've lived a bad life and this is some kind of tragedy. In fact, sometimes it helps things feel a little better.
