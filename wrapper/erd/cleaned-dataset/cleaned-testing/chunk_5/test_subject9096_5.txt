 I always thought this was why guys pissed standing up. 




 I just got a new windows machine (Dell XPS 13 '15 edition) and I LOVE the snapping feature.

Prior, my primary machine was a 27 inch iMac, so never really hurt for screen space hehe. 




 An app would be awesome.

Besides that, I stopped playing in Nov. 2012 and only just picked it back up this month. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Even the popular NC items are the same.  




 Yeah, but I think it's more socially acceptable for us ladies to tell people to stuff it for commenting about what we like. 




 Yep yep yep 10000x yep.

This is my biggest grammar pet peeve, because I feel like when people use 'I' when they should use 'me,' they are incorrectly patting themselves on the back for 'remembering the rule.'

Thank you good sir. 




 Well, it's not from Season 1.

 The one wearing shorts must start the conversation and wax poetic at length about the awesomeness of shorts. 




 There's speculation elsewhere in the thread that may answer your question. 




 Ambiguous 'natural' flavors in some flavored teas. 




 That was Arvel Crynyd. The female A-Wing pilot who was redubbed was Sila Kott. It's an easy mistake though because they look similar in their gear. 




 [Yeah she was awesome.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dine_Ellberger) 




 An excellent point! 




 Porkins bein porkins. 




 AND the guy who gets Indy to go find the Ark of the Covenant. Dude gets around. 




 In the Outer Rim, I'd rather be dead than maimed to be honest lol. 




 Natural flavorings can still be ambiguous. There's a natural flavoring in one of their raspberry herbals that doesn't agree with me that in no way comes from a raspberry. That said, Adagio is my preferred tea retailer! 




 I'm not sure. There is one reference to a female pod racer by Anakin in an EU novel, but it's to describe how horrifically she died.  




 Nope. None whatsoever. :( 




 [She was. Then overdubbed with a male voice](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott)
 




 I have never had a problem with Adagio and their customer service is quite good. I think they use less artificial flavors than Teavana, although they are not completely 'clean.' 




 So useful. Go for it. 




 There were some in the Battle for Naboo! :) 




 The comments in that article make me a sad panda. [Also](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott) 









 Thank you. 




 "It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to, and in direct contact with, an infected case,"

Yep so people will be fear mongering with this even though the scientists admitted it was impossible to control for.

Also

Thursday's study examines the idea that minuscule droplets of body fluid containing the virus could hang in the air and be inhaled by others, providing an unrecognized, if minor, pathway for the virus.

Not the same thing as an Ebola mutated to be airborne! 




 If you read the books, you learn that Picard is fairly unpopular with the brass and that it has a lot to do with the time he spent as a Borg.

Edited to add- The Federation govt. LOVES him. The admiralty is where the problem lies. 









 You are fine. 




 I'd actually recommend this documentary instead. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/video/

Watch it by yourself first though then decide which parts you want to show him. 




 Thank you :) It makes saber sounds when you wave it around and hit it against things too! 




 You can get a hell of an Obi-Wan saber at Ultrasaber. My boyfriend gave me one for Valentine's day. :) [Me and my saber!](http://i.imgur.com/dS2F7LF.jpg)

You can make it any color because it comes with a programmable LED. 




 Archaholic alkeyologists 




 In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.

As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.

I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education. 

Best of luck with your project!

Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it. 




 Your home scale might not be calibrated the same as the one at the doctor. If your clothes feel the same you did not gain ten pounds.
 




 This is my favorite picture of her :) 









 42 hours last week, 38 hours this week. It works out, but it's shifty. 




 No worries. I'm an archaeologist and I understand taking a shit job early career on the other side of the country to get your foot in the door. Best of luck. 




 I really like Atlanta. The area around GaTech is pretty cool and they have a lot of music festivals in the area. Some great museums as well. Can't comment on the dating scene though. Oh and the bars in Buckhead are EXPENSIVE.
 




 Are you an archaeologist? 




 Ultrasaber makes the one he got me. It's Obi-Wan's hilt with an LED you can change to be any color you want.  




 LOL 




 That is the correct level of enjoyment as indicated by the manufacturer.
 




 My cat Abby playing with the lightsaber my boyfriend gave me for Valentine's. :3 









 An intriguing hypothesis. This requires more field testing. :3 




 I was wondering the same thing! 




 They just published a new one so it should be findable. 




 No kidding. I just started watching it because of how much I am enjoying Rebels and holy crap. 




 I love lotso! I have to really bust it to get more than two activations per game, because not only does it take a while to charge but he appears less often in the game. 




 I only got 5 :( 




 I just started watching it. Make sure you find the chronological order! I was just saying last night how I couldn't believe I thought it sucked for so long. 




 LOL :)
