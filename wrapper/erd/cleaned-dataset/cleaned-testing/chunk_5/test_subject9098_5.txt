 I honestly don't know why people say this was so tough.  Maybe it's because I grew up playing the old DK and DK Jr games.  Although it was mostly on the NES. 




 Bond sure has changed a lot since Daniel Craig. 




 Lesbian seagull 




 Am I too late to have a comment that hasn't been taken and will be recognized? 









 Agreed.  Weekends are OK though since there is no work. 









 Although Back to the Future would be a good direction to point them.  I think in this case the South Park episode where Cartman freezes himself for a Wii would help explain things better. 









 Thanks.  We weren't looking to sell them.  Just curious if they did have any value but we couldn't find anything online since the box was blank. 




 My dad got these out over Christmas while the family was home.  The figures are each about 1.5" tall.  It has 2 figures of JFK at the end of it.  The box isn't in the best of shape, but there isn't any information on it to even try to look up. 









 I took these numbers as total profit made since Nintendo got into the video game scene.  Same with the Sony and Microsoft numbers. 




 Hmm, that could make it interesting for me to try watching it then. 














 Me and a friend were sitting in our living room watching tv.  We realized that there were 2 shows on later at the same time that we wanted to watch.  My friend calls my roommate (who is upstairs) to ask him to set his VCR (yes, before dvr was the norm) to record one of the shows instead of one of us walking up the stairs to tell him. 




 Big Lebowski, Toy Story, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park 




 Not sure if I'm missing something, but why is the gold N64 only $149, but the standard one is $199?  Am I looking at something wrong? 









 That was my standard day trying to study when I was in college.  Be at the library reading for about half an hour, take about an hour nap at the table, then study for about another half hour before finally going home. 




 At least you lived long enough to post the picture. 




 Wrestlemania 2000 is the one that gets played to this day with me and my brothers.  Although we do have No Mercy as well. 




 So what does owning a construction company have to do with this? 




 The 2 digit number on the bottom of an anheuser busch can lets you know what time of day it was produced.  Every 15 minutes is an extra digit for the number.  Example: 2:00 am = 08 









 He was way ahead of his time. 




 I have jumped in the lake for the past 10 years, and it has only snowed once during that entire time.  So it seems pretty rare when it does snow. 









 It all depends on who sees it first in r/new if you ask me. 




 Guitar Hero was on 2 games ahead of Rock Band because the first game came out 2 years ahead of the first Rock Band.  Not because they came out with multiple full fledged sequels that often.  But you are correct with the spinoffs that Guitar Hero put out in a short period of time. 




 It's been a while since I've played this, but I thought it was off by one.  So to get the star, you'd actually press the button when the mushroom before the star was in the center of the screen.  and all three rows worked the same way. 




 Are there only 5 levels to the DK Arcade game?  Or are you just throwing a number out there?  Because I have not been able to get through the arcade game myself. 




 And I still read it the correct way on here too. 




 As a bonus, Tom Hanks is still listed as being in the movie! 




 I'm probably one of the few people that actually played through the entire game. 




 True 




 Can't say I'm beta spaghetti pants.  So it looks like the bill would be split 3 ways. 









 Although they are delicious, I'd say that sour patch kids are one step better. 









 And for those who want the [sound effects](http://nooooooooooooooo.com/) with it. 









 I really wanted to see Richard Duncan out there debating! 









 So this is like the Cleveland Show?  Except instead of the bear living next door, it lives with them? 




 TBDBITL! 




 The summers were great for me back in those times.  My dad is the custodian at my school and during the summers he could take a computer home with him and a copy of each of the games.  That way the computers did sit around dormant for 3 months straight. Hours upon hours of Number Munchers, Miners Cave, Odele Lake, etc. 




 So why are you digging through your neighbors trash to begin with? 




 The black one with the big X on it is what I'm referring to.  That would be Xbox. 




 [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Call) is what I was thinking of.  But I really doubt it's referring to the same thing as the article on here. 




 Why does the Xbox controller look so pissed to be with all the others? 




 I think it's sending the signal to space to hopefully contact [aliens](http://qkme.me/3raohs) 




 I'll have to take some time to look through these to help get ideas for this year. 




 But why is he in timeout and sitting in the corner? 




 Woops, I guess I didn't even look at it.  I was looking through posts regarding Ohio State doing a video game themed show from this past weekend and just assumed it was that same show.  My bad. 




 Yeah, Ohio State does do a different half time show every week.  It surprises me how they can learn that stuff so quickly.  3 weeks ago they did one honoring NASA and Neil Armstrong which was pretty neat too. 




 From what I read a few months back, I believe they are going to remain their own country and won't be considered part of Fuji. 




 I think tv executives have already taken care of this question. 




 I went to a public school and had 61 kids in my class.  A neighboring town has around 35 for an average class size. 




 So piss comes out of the faucet? 




 Will Smith and Matthew McConaughey?  How did they get on here? 




 [Stunt Cycle](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1280 st=2) is what I had.  And I actually still have it in working condition to this day. 




 I just assumed it was another day when they were there, and not immediately after all the destruction. 




 I was a little afraid to click on it when i read "chat roulette" in the title. 




 Amen to that!
