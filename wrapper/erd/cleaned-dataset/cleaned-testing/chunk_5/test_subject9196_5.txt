 It is still not released yet, but I will give a presentation about current (and possibly future) status and possibilities at the end of month, and I will upload a presentation about it - https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MichalTajchert/posts 




 *even be possible to create a music controller on an Android watch...?*
Just use ongoing notification for such actions. I think it is a wise move as my 95% of use of sw2 is only notifications.
Also ongoing notifications (as music control) is already available in Google Music, however they didn't released it in API (in preview). 
Custom card UI will be added in final SDK version (around Google IO).

 I'm tire. I'm going home.

FTFY 




 What are 'executive orders'?
Please explain like I'm five. 




 I find **Monsters** (2010) surprisingly good.


[SPOILER - which make whole film a top notch]

First and last scene are the same (with military troops) - mind blowing. 









 Where is PSU in "Vader"?

 Local GDG events (DevFest etc.), I strongly encourage everybody to get in touch with local GDGs.

EDIT: And there is also Mobile World Congress - Barcelona 24-27 Feb. 




 He's not your dude, mate. 









 Op nick "HighLevelJerk" - relevant. 




 Thank you!  









 Yes! You just can't sell/buy it via US bank account - but you can transfer them to some local currency exchange and check out there. 




 You mean to select manually all devices with =1GB RAM? It would be like thousand of them - and you have to check every phone specification.

Apart from screen filtering there is no way to target those devices - I share your pain. Unless you want to select them manually, or programmatically at app start - but both of them are far from perfect. 




 Stay tuned (with auto updates), as it is almost ready (center will trigger clock, and ring - calendar). 




 Some of it I just added in 1.91 version - it's messy but better then nothing. I will polish it in next update. 




 In current version (1.91) you can set them to colors of your calendars. In next update I will give an option to customize them. 




 Sorry, but Android doesn't give a list of alarms, also timely doesn't. 




 Check out latest (1.91) version - I added it. Custom colors will be added in next update - with better organised settings panel. 




 Never say never :)
Reddit made my widget popular so I feel obligated to keep connection and exchange of ideas with you guys. 
Thank you for being one more person happy with that widget. It really means a lot to me. 




 Will look into that but please don't get your hopes up, as there is very little chance that it would work - but I will try! Reddit made my widget popular, so I own you guys. 




 Hi, there... I was wrong, there is a way... (which doesn't drain battery) and I already added it, I will ad Google Calendar colors as option and will push in few hours an update with that! 




 Yes, it have to be in next 12 hours, and it have to be a "not all day one".
Also it refreshes every 30minutes so if you add one in meantime, wait 30min. or remove and add calendar to force update. 




 It will work like that in next or 2.0 update - so matter of days. Stay tuned. 




 Glad that bug turnouts to be a feature.  




 Can't get alarms from Android... Sorry. I would love to.
