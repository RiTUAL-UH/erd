 Bought this razor on a whim without knowing what type it was, after searching online I've found that it is a gillette slim made in 1966. I did a quick clean up just to make sure it twisted and turned in all the ways it should, and everything looks good.

Currently I use a schick krona (which I really like), but I've noticed that the gillette slim is a bit heavier and has a shorter handle. My little sister has shown interest in DE and I want to give her a starter kit for Christmas. Would the shorter handle and the heavier razor be okay for a female beginner? Or should I keep looking for something with a longer handle and lighter weight? 









 You absolutely can profit from working on the island. It's all about knowing how to budget and save - same as any job anywhere. The Jamaicans were some of the hardest working people and mostly friendly. 

Source: worked on the island the past six months and brought home a good chunk of change.  




 If by garbage trucks you mean horse drawn vehicles. 




 The test is very much flawed. I only took one year of Spanish in high school and wasn't very good at it. The test placed me in 202 and I ended up dropping down to 102 and not receiving retroactive credit because I choose to take a course below what I tested into.  




 That's awesome, can you use other fruits aside from apples? Thanks so much, I'll have to try this.  




 Thanks :) 




 How do you know how much to use? I put some of the peels in my apple butter.  




 Make it very similarly to apple sauce, but you cook it longer and make it a smoother texture, comparable to an apple jam or apple spread.  




 I worked with a Welsh girl, a Scottish girl, and an English boy this summer in America, they all sounded completely different. Although if I met someone from the UK I'm not sure I could pinpoint where they were from. 

 




 Awesome! Thanks for the response. I'll probably crack one open later today anyways, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I should look for.  




 Everything on the outside looks like it worked, do I need to open one to make sure it is good on the inside?  









 I saw that as well. I think for now I'll just use something cheap since I won't be actually using the pot to cook in, just for the final canning process. Thank you! 




 Dated a kid named Sean for almost four years, called him Seen the entire time. First time because I thought was how it was pronounced, after that it just became a pet name. 




 Currently work at a coffee shop and I say the same thing, it amazes me how confused people look when they try to figure out how to put cream and sugar in their coffee.  




 I would have looked at a thrift store first if I could, I love them and they are my go to - especially for cooking things. However, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, I am currently living in a place with limited resources. No thrift store, no big chains, basically I need to order it online. I did find someone that is willing to let me borrow a stock pot of theirs though! So for now I'm doing that, but first chance I get I want to get my own. 




 Thanks! 




 Only reason I was looking for stainless steel instead of aluminum is because you can't cook acidic things in it. 

For the actually canning process, there is no difference in what container you use then? As long as it covers the jars and you can heat it on the stove?

I'm in the process of getting a book :) I'm currently living somewhere with extremely limited resources, so I've been relying on friends, family, and internet advice. 

I've been told to start with something easy the first time I can, does it really matter seeing as how I'll still have to go through the same canning steps? My plan is to make apple butter this week and can that as my first item.

Thanks again for all your help! 




 I am new to canning and am in the process of gathering all the equipment I will need. I've ordered [http://www.amazon.com/Norpro-6-Piece-Canning-Set/dp/B0000DDVMH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1381440440sr=8-1keywords=canning+tools] and I've ordered a rack for the bottom of the pot, however I still need a pot. I have a flat stove top so I want to avoid the granite ones. I started looking at stainless steel stockpots and found this one [(http://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Heavy-Stainless-Steel-Savezoneusa/dp/B002GE5GYI/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)]. I've heard good things about it, but is it really necessary to spend 60 dollars on a pot. Does anyone have any other suggestions of good ones that maybe are a bit cheaper? Thank you! 




 These look amazing Nolan! 




 Could you post the list of books you received?  




 Has a book been choosen? I'd love to participate.  




 I'm in the act too old group. :/ 




 That's why I loved hoodies in high school. But then they made it against the dress code to wear them. :/ 




 Applying for everything isn't wrong. I'm completely white, and applied for a scholarship my senior year of high school that was supposed to be given to an African American female that played sports and had a good gpa. I was a perfect candidate for the scholarship, except for the whole being white issue. My principal, who was black, told me to apply anyway because the foundation rather give money to someone than no one and hardly anyone applied for this scholarship. I ended up being one of the people who received the scholarship. I was honest on my scholarship application and checked the box saying I was white. I know this doesn't explain why it isn't racist, but several other people in this thread did a good job of that already. Just wanted to encourage you to apply to any and all scholarships, it isn't wrong and you might get lucky. :) 




 Made a world of difference! :)  




 I just shaved my underarm again and I tried more passes in different directions, this seemed to help, but I'm still not 100% satisfied with it yet. I keep trying to shave the way I used to with my old razor, but that isn't right.

Yes the lather helped with my legs. I ended up doing two passes against the grain. I've tried and tried to go with the grain, but it is the most awkward thing to shave away from my body.
