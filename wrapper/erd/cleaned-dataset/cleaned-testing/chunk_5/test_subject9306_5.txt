 Which city? I might see you there.  




 I feel that I would have a lot more luck in a foreign country. There's so much more to talk and joke about.  




 Beware, it destroys latex condoms! 




 Braces bro. I'm 19 and about to get some. You're never too old.  




 Just because a nation is rich doesn't mean its population is. For example, Guatemala is the world's fifth largest exporter of sugar, coffee and bananas and rakes in a shitton. But *half* of its population - 7 million people - are below the extreme poverty line.

 I don't even know what Red Lobster is and it's probably not even in my country, but still, I want some.  




 Here's your hat and coat 




 I don't think I was ever a truly horrific 'nice guy,' but I struggled (and still do) with the idea that some selfishness or at least putting self-interest first in a relationship is not only healthy but almost required.  




 I'm from Australia, it's basically required 




 I think you're going to get downvoted for this because your wording is a little aggressive, but it would be worth noting that this is the impression the comment's OP receives from reddit, not necessarily her opinion on the world.  




 Yeah I did, OP clarified it for me.  




 I said it in the other thread and I'll say it again: I think that /r/seduction, despite its flaws, actually teaches men to treat women better and be less misogynistic by dispelling the myth of the friendzone and showing them how to be genuinely attractive. 

Perhaps a better example is /r/faimprovement.  




 My mistake. It's a little different then, but I still think it would be a shocking idea to say I love you regardless of how he feels about you. On one hand, even if he does feel the same, I'd say you haven't been back together for long enough for it to withstand that level of serious commitment. If he doesn't feel that way about you, sheer and utter disaster.  




 EDIT: I derped and missed the fact that they're back together now. Keep that in mind. 

I think the fact that he's not your boyfriend and hasn't been in a year would have been a nice inclusion in the title. 

I'm actually not going to go back and read it all because this question is very, very easy:

1) does he feel the same about you? Do you know this for certain? If yes to both, get back together and be happy. If no to either, proceed to step 2. 
2) he no longer wishes to be in a relationship and has moved on. There is *absolutely nothing* you can do about this, and you need to move on as well. It was good while it lasted, and now you need to pack up the memories and think about someone else. Continuing to dwell on this guy will only hurt you, and telling him you LOVE him will stir up all kinds of trouble (even if he still has genuine affection for you). 




 When you phrase them in a way that makes men feel manipulated by the big bad nasty women, of course they will.  




 PSA: 'whoosh' has been so used and abused that it is now downvoted regardless of context and usage. Please stop trying, for your own karma. 




 I think you're the female version of the 'nice guy.' 




 I find it incredibly ironic that (it seems to me) the type of people who think that the best way to be attractive is to be nauseatingly nice to women are usually the most casually misogynistic. 

In this way, as someone who regularly reads /r/seduction with their doucheometer primed and their salt shaker at the ready (just in case, it's usually a fairly nice place), that subreddit actually teaches and encourages BETTER treatment of women - usually by turning jaded and misogynistic 'nice guys' into people who are accepting of their own flaws and of everyone around them, regardless of gender.  




 ... yeah that's a bit messed up. 




 Let's hang on a second. From what I've read (and please correct me) we have no indication of whether this Cheyenne KNOWS the man is taken, let alone married. 

She might think this is a perfectly legitimate relationship. Yeah, a 16 year old going out with a 25 year old is weird (and seemingly illegal in OP's area of the world). But I've seen weirder, and young girls have a serious boner for older guys. This isn't going to change. Let's not crucify her as a manipulative, husband-stealing bitch just yet.

EDIT: for some perspective - and I know this isn't quite the same nor the same level of magnitude, but I'm currently 19. When I had just turned 18,  my first kiss was with a 23 year old girl. It didn't go further than that and we're now friends. I don't consider it a negative experience at all, and though it's a little different because I was legal everywhere and male - and thus completely impervious to all forms of manipulation or sexual abuse (sarcasm) - I think OP's case could be viewed in a similarly more generous way. Teenagers will be teenagers. 

The 25 year old man, though, is just a cunt.  




 how to make friends better than normal people do 




 Her: I have a boyfriend
You: I have a maths test tomorrow
Her: what?
You: oh, I thought we were talking about stuff we can cheat on

EDIT: Not seriously suggesting using this, it's just a joke I heard.   




 I suppose that if everybody is equal in value there are a lot more options, and an increased chance of securing another partner. Interesting idea.  




 I might add that relationships at your age usually last for a few months at best, so the whole dramatic declaration of undying love is probably going to be moot a few years later.  




 Bro, there are many, many people in the world who didn't 'get a girlfriend' until 18 (like me) or even 21. 

If you tick off the years on your calendar and worry that you are x age with no relationship, then you're treating it like external validation of your self-worth, and as a status symbol. That's quite unhealthy, and when you do find a girl at whatever age, that's the only way you will see her. As an achievement, something you get points for on Xbox live. 

Relax, wait for someone you are comfortable with and genuinely wants to be with you - more importantly, someone that YOU genuinely want to  be with - and then go for it. Not before.  




 It's also fairly evident from all the threads about men receiving compliments - there was a good one last night - that even for the attractive ones, it's basically impossible for them to think someone might be interested in them or find them attractive. I think men purposefully ignore a lot of hints and put them down to accidents or vagaries of behaviour. 

There's also the fact that it's much more risky for men to act on a hint than it is for women. The terms 'creepy' and 'potential rapist' spring to mind.  




 I'm 19, and believe me, people change at the end of school. They get tossed out of their established social circles and comfort zones into the big wide world, and they grow up real fast. 

As far as the dating world goes, I've noticed people become more mature and less selfish in their relationships - less likely to dump someone because they know they can get another due to their social status (as the quarterback, cheerleader etc).  




 Or we don't know that we are because no one ever tells us 




 Pretty sure singing that song actually makes you more manly 




 I'm a big hit with female octopi? 




 Squishy and round? Like the rest of me? 




 I don't know why people would bother trying to pass fake off as real when we have /r/eroticliterature. Plenty of good stuff over there.  




 You're not forever alone. You're not ugly. You're awesome, and everyone here thinks so. 

Don't let me hear you say any bullshit in return, because a) every 'forever alone' I've known usually finds great happiness as soon as they stop using that as their identity, and b) self-confidence and assurance are the most important qualities in being attractive to females. Bottom line, if you label yourself as forever single, YOU WILL BE. 

But I highly doubt that at 27 you've gone through life with no female attention whatsoever - even some that you haven't noticed, probably because you're busy convincing yourself that you're not awesome. 

So go be awesome.  




 This doesn't mean at all that we don't FEEL this excitement. With my ex, I couldn't get over the fact that she was a concert violinist and incredibly intelligent and into all the same books as me and blah blah blah.

But I'm not allowed to tell anyone, because let's face it, guys aren't socially allowed to feel those things about ourselves or each other, let alone another human being that I'm only allowed to publicly view as a piece of meat I have sex with. So for most of us, if the only thing we care allowed to say is how good the sex is or something equally demeaning to her, we'd rather say nothing at all.  




 Yeah, you don't want to scare him off. Especially if it accidentally all goes south and his response is a solid no (for whatever reason) - you can come back from a 'let's go out some time,' but you can't recover from 'I've loved you since I was seven.'  




 Dicks can be as wide as coke cans?

Well now I feel self confident 




 Most people shame Size Queens because a guy who says "I won't sleep with a woman unless she has large breasts" would be drawn and quartered. It's only fair.  




 Moooooo 




 If a relationship is essentially being really great friends plus sex, then you'd think the majority of the personality qualities you look for in a relationship are also found in your friends.  




 That's absolutely fascinating. Thank you.  




 If the female masturbation thread over in /r/sex is anything to go on, my friends (who are mostly female) aren't attracted to me (nor do I want them to be). How could they judge? 




 Trouble is, we have no frame of reference for comparison. I *think* I'm really into my hobbies, I *think* I put a lot of effort into being well presented and fun to be around, I *think* I work really hard at my career - but what if I don't? How will I know? 




 Soon there will be a reddit financial crisis from all the lost upvotes.  




 ... does this mean that males have or are willing to have a great deal more imagination in these things? 




 Extremely. 

I think this is also fairly well known in the gender subreddits. Probably not worth a thread on.  




 Sex with slenderman? 




 Not all of them do. That's a huge generalization. I'd actually say quite a lot don't, and that reddit is a biased statistic to draw on. 

Both of my best friends are female and I will never sleep with them. This is my *own choice* (as well as presumably theirs) because I value their friendship.  




 This is actually a very interesting comment. I know the 'friendzone' is an utter load of shit - basically Nice Guys who are emotionally and in personality unattractive whining about how they don't get laid - but the counter argument to it is usually that "it's the same for both genders, of you're not attractive you're just not attractive" etc - which is some merit. 

Here, however, we have direct evidence that the genders do actually have different potential-sexual relationships with their friends. 




 Dude, you have so much self-confidence, self respect, determination and charisma. When you lose a bit more, you're going to be beating the girls of with a stick. Seriously. Hell, you probably do now.  




 A further point to take from this - you know that guy over there at the bus stop, who looks really serious and intimidating and unapproachable? He's just as afraid of you as you are of him. 

This also applies to approaching the opposite sex. At the end of the day, past all the seduction techniques and the game and the self confidence and the blah blah blah, the girls and boys you talk to have just as many insecurities and fears as you do. They're trying to hide them and put on a brave face just like you - but they still really just want someone to love them just like you do. They're not so terrifying after all.  




 Congratulations. I'm really happy you're still with us. PM me if you ever need to talk - if you feel that way again.  




 concerned for my physical safety

I'm sorry, but don't you think that's jumping the gun a bit? So he comes off as rude and immature. He doesn't pick up social clues. I'm hardly an expert, but that all sounds like he's on the autistic spectrum to me. To be assuming he's a physical threat to your well being because of some sarcasm is a bit offensive - and that behaviour and attitude is, in fact, dangerous to him. 

If all of this behaviour was coming from a female, would you label them as a potential murderer or rapist? 




 Damn right man. That's the correct attitude. 

I lost mine when I was 18, and while it was fun and I've done it again since (... a fair bit), you're not missing out on anything vitally important.  




 Jesus loves you more than you could know, wow wow wow 




 How was that an issue?! 




 I wish everyone has this kind of tolerance. I got dumped by my ex girlfriend because - I quote - "I wasn't enough of a dickhead to her."

I know exactly what I did wrong, I was a bit too nice and not 'exciting' enough - too easy to be in a relationship with - but it still seemed pretty unfair to me.  




 Noob question, how are you achieving that particular look with your cuffs and that jumper? 




 Would you please elaborate for the noob on Barney's anti-PUA? 




 Hi mate. I broke my laptop a few days ago, and I've just realized AlienBlue doesn't receive PMs. So I won't be able to read what you've sent me until I've got access to another computer, which shouldn't be too long, but please don't think I'm ignoring you or that I don't care.  




 That's no problem. I'm sure I'd be equally offended if someone said that men don't have body image issues or a damaging media stereotype to live up to like women do.  




 Thank you. However, somebody evidently disagrees with you.  




 I'd say the reason for this is almost exclusively a focus in media on chivalrous and kind, door-opening, dinner-paying men, with a lot less representation of the dominant aspects that make them attractive, so as not to appear superior to women and offend the vocal and relatively new feminist community.  




 You're absolutely right. If they're not attractive, it's just not going to work. I think it really should come down to *awareness* of the exact things females find attractive (as opposed to the things that males think females find attractive) - ironically enough, I had no idea until I ventured into these parts of reddit.

I actually think a discussion of what both genders typically find attractive should actually be a core part of sexual education classes.  




 The first one at least is something they just to man up and deal with to get past, just like we do.  




 I never said women don't have dating struggles. I just don't know what they are, probably due to the fact that I'm 19 and reasonably inexperienced.  




 The reaction to a female showing her vagina would most likely be much less legative than that to a male displaying his penis.
