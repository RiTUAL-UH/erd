 An argument based on a fallacy should be thrown out. But a conclusion based on a fallacious argument isn't necessarily wrong. 




 You don't have to have any logical reasoning to be right, just to expect other people to agree.

I can argue the sun will rise in the East because I farted 12 times. The sun will still rise in the East. 




 This will affect all lawyers, not just PI lawyers. Those who lose business because of driverless cars will spread out to the other areas. 




 Well, after reading the comments, I'm scared shitless to watch the whole thing.

Can someone tell me what happens? 




 I agree but... she ran around topless and snatched a fake baby Jesus. Seems to be a bit of pearl clutching to me.

I think a better response by the Vatican would have been a bit of Christmas levity: fine her, let her go, and call it a day. 




 _The Metro Spirit_ used to be a great alternative paper. Now it's just a tabloid. 




 My ex-wife and I both have divorced parents, all four in the same town. Christmas was a gauntlet. 




 Gorgeous, darling. Gorgeous. 




 How many Mozarts are stuck at Walmart? 




 What sort of assumptions? 




 Hey I'm just trying to offer insight into something you asked about, and I have done nothing but discuss the issue with you in a respectful manner.

No need to be dismissive. 




 I _can_ distinguish between the two. But I also know that people with power tend to use that power. Keeping the two departments separate does not mean the owner's influence isn't felt: who is hired/fired, who is promoted, who gets invited to lunch, etc.

And then, yes, there are the people who cannot or do not distinguish the two. If you're worried about how the paper is perceived, it's not enough to say, "Well they shouldn't think that." They _do_, and that's the reality that must be dealt with.

_The Augusta Chronicle_ consistently wins awards and that speaks very well of the reporting side. But there's always that nagging thought that supporting the paper means you're supporting the editorial staff (because, well, you are to a degree - you're giving it a platform).

My main point is that the paper is perceived as a whole, facts be damned. This means that the hyper-fringe nature of the editorial staff causes people to shun the news content. 




 Well, I'm telling you that that's not the perception. Someone moving here from, say, Oregon, is going to read one editorial and immediately form a negative opinion about the paper.

Edit: And unless you're actually Billy Morris, I don't see how you can claim it isn't even _possible_. That's an extraordinary claim. 




 That's definitely a possibility, and maybe even likely. But when the editorial staff is so obviously *not* reasonable, readers are going to see that throughout the paper.

It's like trying to claim FOXNews isn't O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. Or MSNBC isn't Maddow, Sharpton, Matthews, etc. I understand the difference between news and opinion, but also know that it is impossible to keep them 100% separate in practice. 




 Can anyone in the industry comment on the issue without condescension?

No, Mr. Mortgage Guy, buying a home isn't a great investment like it used to be. Understanding that is the opposite of being ignorant about investing in home ownership. 




 It honestly colors every article I read. I don't doubt that the average employee has good intentions but Billy Morris has a Dr. Evil reputation (which is completely supported by the editorials - they're not just "Right", they're "off the radar Right").

It's not completely unreasonable to believe he uses his influence to push certain news stories and not others.

The editorial staff is hurting the overall paper. 




 Face for radio? Kidding... but it seems obvious that physical attractiveness is a key asset for anyone selling anything on TV. 









 What explains this? 




 Bullshit. 




 Haha, I am horrible at keeping track of redditors but thank you. I responded favorably to that thread. Hating Augusta is _tired_. 




 Wasn't Broad Street the widest street in the country at some point? Or is that a local legend? 




 I second the how so (except for the editorial board of the Augusta Chronicle). Our reporters and newspeople are great. I imagine it's a cutthroat business and there's a lot of shuffling as people move up to bigger markets.

And has anyone else noticed the TV reporters keep getting more and more attractive? 




 Welcome! It's a great little sub. Please post often - you'll find a receptive crowd. 




 How so? I find it to be quite active for Augusta's size.

Augusta redditors will get out of this sub what they put into it. I post content frequently and encourage others to do the same.

But if there's one thing Augusta has plenty of, it's negative attitudes. Post more if you think it should be more active. 




 Island Seafood has been selling raw oysters for 30+ years. Johnny's has been doing the same for about half as long. 




 I'm not sure there aren't exceptions (for preliminary steps that can be taken). Mayor Young seemed to think it was a possibility, and he would know more than just about anyone. 




 Rented it just to encourage this new distribution model and give a big ole fat finger to North Korea's Dear Leader.

Now to see if it's any good. 




 I'm not necessarily disagreeing (I was not impressed with the renovation) but I can speak from personal experience that Rhinehart's is not the only place that successfully sells oysters.

There is a large market for them actually (although perhaps not at a restaurant). 




 I think the line was that the tribe had an historic claim to the land. But, yes, it does appear it was horseshit (a prank on the former mayor). 




 It's not uncommon for one news outlet to get a scoop. But that is why I posted to see if anyone had heard anything. However, it looks like it was a prank on former Mayor Bob Young (who was filling in for Austin Rhodes). 




 Oh for Chri... I'm sleeping until the New Year. 




 Might just be a prank on Bob Young (former mayor subbing in for Austin Rhodes). 




 Greg Williams, the attorney for the Yakama tribe, just claimed on the Austin Rhodes Show that the tribe will be purchasing Regency Mall and turning it into a casino. It is scheduled to open by Masters 2016.

Mr. Williams further claimed that preliminary permits have been obtained and the city has signed off on it.

Does anyone know _anything_ about this? 




 Restrain/arrest her? Why should physically attacking her be the first option? 




 Your attitude is definitely part of the problem. De-escalation should be the goal, not escalation. Physically attacking someone simply because they yell at you is not rational behavior. 




  deserve a beat down

A beat down for screaming in someone's face? For fuck's sake... 




 Same for Georgia. I expected "man" to be an option before I opened the link. 




 Check out the border between [India and Bangladesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Bangladesh_enclaves). It contains the world's only third order enclave. 




 Easily divisible by multiples of 60 (minutes/hour). It would make estimating time to destination simple relative to other speeds. 




 I suspect there is upward pressure to 120 km/hr due to the easy math. 




 I love the suggestion that the boys sleep in your brother's room, and the girls sleep in your room. If your father is being genuine, this will alleviate the problem.

If your father refuses, then the rules are arbitrary and simply a power trip. That means he loses the high ground and it is completely reasonable for you to decline to visit.

Offer to respect him and his rules with a reasonable compromise. If he then chooses to disrespect your relationship and your boyfriend, he has no one else but himself to blame if you're not there. 




 It's the back right paw that kills me. 




 I usually try to set the end time for when I expect to leave. Its not perfect but would work well _enough_ for something like this. 




 The critical program I use at work does not run on Chrome. 




 Fuck at first I thought that was a wine glass and cringed at the possible outcome... 




 Right. The brutality and maliciousness of the concept is masked by using animals. If Yahweh demanded human sacrifice, the religion would never have made it. 




 1102 usually does a block party.

Edit: Oh, not that upscale. More of an early 20s bar crowd. 




 No it wouldn't. Dash cam, cell phone GPS from everyone in the car, plus their testimony. 




 It should have been very easy to prove the sign was not a stop sign. Assuming this story is true, of course. 




 The Senate is the festering sore. 




 And it's not new. 




 The best way I've heard it put is this: The job of a defense attorney is to make the prosecutor do his/her job. If you think the defendant is guilty, prove it.

Once you understand that, it's not controversial. The alternative is due process in name only, i.e., corruption. 




 I need to move. 




 Women had to give birth in hospitals or they would die. 




 Not voting is tacit endorsement of the outcome.

 Perhaps. Perhaps not. What remains true is that it is incorrect to say that terrorists are controlling whether we can watch _Team America_. 




 Recognizing a difference between a full ban and a ban of one out of many mediums is not pedantic. 




 That wasn't the original comment. The original comment was that terrorists are controlling *if* we can watch _Team America_, not whether we can watch it one way and not another.

I agree that terrorists are controlling whether we can watch _Team America_ in theaters. But that is a separate issue. 




 Yes it is. This thread is about _Team America_ and a comment that hackers are controlling what we can watch.

It is undeniable that hackers are not preventing us from watching _Team America_.

While related, _The Interview_ is not the subject of this thread or subthread. 




 But not via any other medium. I can watch _Team America_ tonight if I want to. 




 /u/timacles specifically commented on _Team America_:

Theres are 10 other mediums in which you could watch 'Team America' right this moment.

In reply to this statement by /u/EmJay115:

A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see.

/u/SubHumanGarbage then asked if /u/timacles meant that the _The Interview_ was cancelled for "reasons OTHER than the terrorists hackers attacking [Sony]." That's a red herring and is not what /u/timacles stated. /u/timacles stated that the terrorists are not stopping you from watching _Team America_, and that is true. 




 No, /u/timacles is saying that this statement is false:

A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see. 









 Holy Hell I never thought I'd see this. Great decision. 




 The DA should be ashamed. Rule of law? Ha... 




 I'm only 32. When I was 16, we paid 60 cents per gallon.

Edit: The downvote confuses me. I remember being upset when I got less in "gallons" than I gave in "dollars". 




  Looks like they're trying to turn the mindless section of the right wing against net neutrality by tying it to government regulation. 

If my local newspaper's comment section is any indication, it is working. They are rabid but up until a few weeks ago, had no comment on net neutrality (probably because they knew nothing about it).

Now, it's a "government takeover" and they are armed with talking points. It's fucking depressing. 




 Sure. But if the federal court system is well on it's way to being entirely paperless, I can't imagine there are many arguments that it can't be done elsewhere.

Originals do not have to be physical (they usually aren't in federal court - the entire official record is electrons). 




 K-Pax 




 The U.S. federal court system is overwhelmingly, if not entirely, electronic. You don't get much more "official" for a government document than a court order.

Documents can be e-signed and anything that must be notarized can be done with a stamp instead of a clamp, uploaded, and shredded (not 100% paperless but just about). 




 What the fuck.

He either cheated or he's a sociopath. Either way, I suggest you get out of that relationship ASAP. 




 Yep. The price would obviously be a huge factor, though. 




 "Checks and balances" generally refers to controls _between_ government institutions to prevent abuse _by_ government officials/employees. 




 It's simple: the police need to be afraid of something. Not in a physical way or anything, but in an accountability way.

Checks and balances still work. 




 Big Wallet user - got it!

 Taylor Swift. She took all her songs off streaming apps but obviously YouTube is too important to NOT be on.

I can now listen to Shake It Off in repeat again.

 Can someone who supports what we did and also idolizes Reagan explain how both of those ideas can coexist given this information?

 It's to some degree an Augusta thing. My mom makes pronouncing it that way an art form.

"Woortur." "Woortur."

"Who taught me English???" 




  wurter

Oh god. Mom... 




 I live in GA (not in Atlanta) and didn't realize I never pronounce the second "t" until that post.

No one does. Ever. 




 It's definitely an English word now. We steal words in the best way. 




  managed to hold out until 2004

I had a friend that felt the same way. Why did you consider this a badge of honor? 




  You will not be denied employment for holding it (so long as said opinion is not relevant to your job duties).

This is not true. 




 so brave

Again, grow up. I'm sure you don't think you are a racist. But you are. Thanks goodness humans as a whole are better than you. 




 The fact that you feel confident the attackers are black with no evidence simply demonstrates you are a racist. Nothing more.

Grow the hell up, man. Race is not a reason to hate someone. 




 "Conservative" can easily fit that description, though. If you favor "stability, familiarity, tradition", you clearly think that the way things are now is the right way. "Progressive" only means "the one that is right" if you agree that progress is a good thing (which we have defined "conservative" to disagree with). 




 Nope. You're just jumping to a racist conclusion. Nothing "earth shattering" about that. 




 Stormfront

Wish I'd never googled that one... those people are awful.

 How the hell does this assertive post based on nothing put speculation have any upvotes? 




 Source? The article has zero detail about the race of the attackers. Hell, it has zero detail period about the attackers. 




 CatoPapers

If you're going to astroturf, at least try and be a bit more subtle about it. 




 I saw someone make a great point about all this. If we're not going to prosecute anyone, then the President needs to pardon everyone who could have been prosecuted.

At least that way we acknowledge that it was a crime. 




  I've yet to meet someone in their 20s that claims to love it here.

That might be the issue. My peer group is 28-38 (approx.). And they overwhelmingly love it here. 

 




 Imagine what would happen if something truly irritated him...

Probably less. He's a bully and probably only picking on this restaurant because he know's they aren't financially equipped to push back.
 




 The easiest way to conceptualize this is to mentally expand the turning section as if it is a cross street at an intersection. As a driver would never turn left into oncoming traffic, your rule should be crystal clear. 




 Check the user name. Clearly a fair-minded individual. 




 It's not you racist jackass. 




 Even with good business young professionals simply don't want to live here.

This is simply not true. I am a young professional and am very social with my colleagues. For the most part, the only young professionals I know that do not _love_ living in Augusta are those who were raised here. 




 But nearly everyone pays taxes (I can't think of a circumstance where someone lives in this country and wouldn't). Income taxes are not the only taxes people pay. 




 Looks to me like the top came and is now super sensitive, especially if his bottom clamps down as he's pulling out. 




 I hope the lack of teeth was a baby teeth thing and not a dental hygiene problem.

Poor child :-( 




 Legally, there is a concept called the Eggshell Rule which essentially means you take your victim as they are. If someone has brittle bones and you punch them causing them to break 10 bones, you are liable. If they have a heart condition and you scare them causing a heart attack, you are liable.

I'm not sure if NY has a version of this rule but it is common. 




 Yahoo Maps? 




 Based on federal law, there are limitations, e.g., sex, race, religion. I know this is a state law map but I bet a good many, if not most, of the states that do not protect LGBT employees do protect employees based on certain criteria.

If and when Australia has a manned space program, they must use this term. 




 Dying city? The overwhelming evidence points to the contrary, with the Cyber Command being the largest piece. 




 Not paying interest in the context of a subsidized loan is equal to the government paying it. You have money you would not have had otherwise, thanks to the government.

I don't really see an important distinction.

 This pains me to report. 









 Thanks :) I hope this works!
