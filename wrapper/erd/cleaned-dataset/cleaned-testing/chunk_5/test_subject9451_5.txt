 Wow this is exactly what I needed! Thank you so much for the in depth advice, I'm going to employ it as best as I can. It reminds me of some bad advice a friend gave me...she got on me cause I said I would "try", and by doing that I am deliberately setting myself up for failure and giving myself after way out. as you said, I'd rather be prepared for the inevitable slip-up than promise to NEVER mess up again and hate myself when I do.

Thank you again. As soon as my situation allows I'll try to find someone in my area who can help! 




 Middle of South Louisiana? I do believe we may be in the same area! Go cajuns? 




 Damn I didn't know that! Thanks for the info!! 




 Thank you, I appreciate the advice! I'll definitely check out that sub and try to get some help. 




 Man people are fucking jerks. Ignore them, your dog is cute as hell. 




 This is really impressive but every time I see intricate work like this, I imagine getting really irritated at the Caff cause I just want my damn coffee but the barista had a vision and damn it they will see it through! 




 Wow humans are fucking gross 




 Damn I'm an meat eater all the way but this has some sarah mclachlan-level guilt tripping skills. 




 Best of luck with your recovery! Therapy isn't an option at the moment. I'm unemployed, don't have insurance, and my husband makes too much to get any kind of assistance. Thank you for the adcive, maybe soon I'll be able to use it :) 




 I'm with you 100%. Working out in the morning is absolutely not an option for me. I had to get into that auto pilot mindset. Don't think about doing it, just shut your brain down, drive to them gym, get changed and get started. After working out like 15 mins you just decided "I'm here and doing it, might as well get it done!". Do that enough and it will become habit, like when you have a day off but find yourself accidentally driving to work anyway? It's just like that.
You can do this!! You know you can, you just have to get out of your own way. 




 (I don't even know if this is the right thread so sorry if it isnt.)

My husband has noticed this behavior, too.
For example, today I finished up a Diet Bet and won, so my husband wanted to celebrate with eating ANYTHING I wanted for dinner. I opted for pizza. I got my own large stuffed crust pizza and after restricing ate the whole goddamn thing by myself.
I felt so so shitty afterwards, and if I hadn't recently gotten my wisdom teeth pulled I fear would dislodge the blood clots, I would have purged. I've never done this before and couldn't cause vomiting would have caused the blood clots to dislodge.


Anyway I do shit like this sometimes. I don't want to claim I have a problem with a restriction and binging cycle, I don't want give myself excuses or be dramatic about overeating when other people have serious problems...I just can't tell and I don't have the funds to see a professional about this.

Anyone have any tips or resources they're willing to share so I can get my shit together? I'm going to start another diet bet tomorrow and I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I just keep self-sabotaging and getting in my own way.

EDIT: Was missing the majority of a clarifying sentence. Oops. Posting on mobile is hard. 




 I'm with you. Public shaming and bullying your kid is just going to fuck them up and probably turn them into a jerk and a bully, having learned it's an acceptable way to deal with people. 




 I box! It's excellent for getting out the aggression and bad feelings. Title Boxing is a great place to start if you're interested.  




 This is me 100% and the biggest thing that's helped me is DietBet. Bet $30 you can lose 4% of your body weight in a month, and you split the pot with everyone else who did the same. The bet I'm currently in has a pot of almost  $375,000. I just ask myself "do I want cookies or money? Do I want to watch Netflix instead of working out, or do I want the cash?"
I heard a radio interview of some guy winning  $400 from a DietBet, and I just lost my job so it's a HUGE motivation for me. I plan just keep doing dietbets till the habit sticks without the money.  




 That's a good point, makes me think about the controversy when Brittney Spears released If U Seek Amy. A lot of people had a big problem with that. 




 Man that makes the band name so much better. A riot of kittens. Kitten Riot.
