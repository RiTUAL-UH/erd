 My brother is from Sweden. Some places are really pretty! I highly recommend going, if you ever get he chance. 




 Well that's good. 




 Where are you? 




 Cancun is amazing. Make sure to go parasailing!  




 At least you're creative! 




 Aw why not? 




 Any place you have ever wanted to visit or see in person? 




 Have you checked the game settings? Maybe you accidently turned them down? Stupid question, but it's possible. 




 Mine is all old and wrinkly even though I tried making the parents and grandparents young. :/ 




 Alright I might be on later today. 




 No, he does not. 




 Middle school! I played that in 5th grade but it stopped really quick when none of us got in trouble. 




 I remember a few months ago when I started playing the game again. I felt so amazing I never wanted to stop playing. 




 Oops,look what I commented below! Sorry I'm just getting used to this mobile app. 




 Aww I just got off but I might be on tomorrow if I finish my homework. My gamer tag is Jade Sueta. Just add me and when I get to it I'll accept. See you soon :) 




 I'm a noob that wants money so if anyone wants to do some missions with me to help me rank up that would be awesome! Leave your gamertag below I will add you in a few minutes. I'm on xbox btw 




 Yeah especially when they are a low rank or don't have any good guns :/ 




 If everyone's blip is red then that means they have been bad. 




 What is your favorite color? 




 If you want to play add me at Jade Sueta. I will be playing on Normal. Mic preffered.  




 My xbox fell and my GTA got totally scratched but I'll try to buy a new one later today :) 




 Wow I never realized that I have already completed half of school(not including college, of course). And of course I'm proud of my "manly music". Thanks for asking a question. Have an internet point. 




 Yes. They are amazing. I'm a girl, but I grew up sort of a tomboy. When I turned 11 I think, I started changing and liking some girly things. But you can never make me not like the Weeknd. 




 Either P!nk, Ed Sheeran, or The Weeknd. 




 About 6 months ago. 




 Oops! Well it's good she is doing better, anyway :) 




 Aww well I hope she gets better, if there is any way too. It's nice she has such a great son to take care of her:) 




 Where where you vacationing at? I'm definitely afraid of spiders. All spiders. All sizes. No no no. 




 How are you doing right now? 




 Is she doing okay right now? When was her last seizure? How bad is her memory loss? 




 7th grade. We got our schedule and walked around campus. Super boring. 




 I got it back. Thanks! 




 Oh I knew I would have to call someone but Mor's only got added to my phone after I joined 3 different lobbies. Thanks! 




 The movie changed a lot of things. If it wasn't a book, it would have been a fair movie though. 




 I made the mistake of wearing pants and I felt like death. AMA 




 Try bag balm. It really helps. 




 You can me if you want too. GT: jade Sueta 




 If you are on xbox add Jade Sueta. I'll be on in a while. 




 No it's not. First people spawned ufo's but now the hackers like to spawn rocks. Nothing specialz 




 I have insurance on my car but how do I get it back? I thought if I had insurance on it I could never lose it...... 




 Yeah but with how much people drive around it would get annoying as hell after a few hours. 




 Woops. 




 I'm online right now. Add me at Jade Sueta. 




 Pot shot is really good it gives you 10,000 dollars and it's not that hard. That and definitely rooftop rumble. 




 This is in easy mode right? 




 Ha. I love seeing posts from so long ago. 




 That's great. Naturevideo games. Get out and explore. 

It seems like everyone I meet that has a mic just wants to point a gun at my head and make me join the crew. I would rather get shot a million times than join a crew with those douches. But I'm sure sometime I'll find a good crew and some friends. Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I hope you don't get eaten by a bear, and I'm on mobile so sorry if I made a bunch of spelling errors. Farewell, pleasant internet friend. 




 Cool. If there's ever an opportunity to have more fun, I will always take it. Thanks, I was gonna see if any of my friends had gta5, and now I can't wait to get back to my xbox and level up some more :D. Do you have xbox by any chance?  




 What exactly will I do with friends? What can I do with them that I can't in solo? 




 I'm a level 8 and trying to answer this question as well. But if you get one person into a mission lobby with you and keep doing races with one person you can rank up really fast. If you are on xbox I would love to add you and go on some missions together. 




 So don't be a douche. Got it.  




 Yeah I have a mic. Alright, see you then.:) 




 99.9% of people just rubbed their eyes to see if it still works. 




 West coast. Yeah I'm still on. GT Jade Sueta if you wanna add me I guess. 




 Xbox sorry I forgot to put that. 




 Any good ways to earn some money other that glitches? 




 I noticed this too and thought it was quite funny. 




 I hear that the higher ranks are going to demolish me. Any tips for a newbie? 




 Really. 




 I think I have this. I always seem to want to pull out my eyebrows and eyelashes. I never knew it was a mental disorder. 




 I have not built any parks but I would love to just free skate on hardcore with someone. I'll be on in a few days to add you.  




 Bath or shower? 




 Then go to coolmath4kids. They have plenty of fractions. 




 But the spiders wanted revenge.. 




 I added you.  :D 




 I'm twelve and I strongly disagree with that. I wish I got to choose, but I didn't, because people like you think I'm "just a kid" and I don't know anything. 




 Are you online? We could play? 




 OMG I'm a girl :O lol
