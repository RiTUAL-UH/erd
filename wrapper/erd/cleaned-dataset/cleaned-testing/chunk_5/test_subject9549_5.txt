 Congrats on the upcoming nuptials. My husband and I went to Disney for our honeymoon in 2013. It was a great experience. I'm not a Disney expert like a lot of people here, but I'll put forth what I know from both my honeymoon and my research for our upcoming trip. 

We also decided to move to a Universal Hotel. We ended up just getting a cab, and I think it cost us $40 to get from Port Orleans to the Crowne Plaza on Universal Blvd. It cost the same amount to get to the airport from the Crowne Plaza. Not trying to keep you from switching hotels, but I'd like to mention that I was severely disappointed we didn't stay at the Disney hotel the entire time. I hated having to repack and move all of our stuff halfway through the honeymoon. Also, I really hated dealing with transportation to the airport when we could've just taken the Magical Express to the airport for free if we had just stayed at Disney. But that's just me; I'm sure others don't mind switching hotels, and I'm sure there are better deals for cabs than what we got. 

We went to DisneyQuest about two hours before it closed, when tickets were half price. Even then it was not worth it. Most of the games were broken. The Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster is awesome, but we waited in line for a half hour...then it broke down. The roller coaster simulator is amazing, but I think - and correct me if I'm wrong - they have something similar at Epcot. So, overall, I would urge you to stay away from DQ and spend your money elsewhere. 

I would also suggest reconsidering Planet Hollywood. The food really isn't that great. 

Downtown Disney is a hit or miss for people. It's a lot of shops and restaurants mainly. They also have Cirque du Soleil, a movie theater, and a bowling alley. I love going there, but for me it's not somewhere I spend my entire day - just the evening for dinner and light shopping. The Lego Store is awesome for bringing out the kid in your. Check out the House of Blues if you're into music. And if you're chocolate and/or dessert lovers, try Ghirardelli. Two words: free samples. I have read DD can be nightmarish with the current construction but I don't know much about that - perhaps people who've been recently can comment on that. 

Have you looked into the Boardwalk? I've never been but I'm hoping to check it out when I go in May. It's similar to DD, but I have heard its quieter. It has Jellyrolls - a dueling piano bar - and Atlantic Dance Hall, both of which is 21+ and open until about 2am. 

Be prepared for a lot of attention! People saw our buttons and congratulated us. The driver on the Magical Express announced our marriage. When we met characters, the handlers made a big deal out of the fact we were newlyweds. I know some restaurants will do something special if they know it's your honeymoon. They made our table a little more romantic at Tony's - it was sweet. My husband and I got super super super cheesy and we got a pick of us eating the same strand of spaghetti like they do in Lady and the Tramp. 

Have you looked into the horse drawn carriage rides? I believe both Port Orleans and Fort Wilderness offer them. They're romantic and relaxing. If you end up going to Downtown Disney, you could take the boat to Port Orleans and do the carriage ride there. 

Look at websites with crowd calendars. I'm not certain which site is the best, maybe someone can suggest one, but I think easywdw.com is good. Crowd calendars break down which parks will be most or least crowded east day and basically suggests which day to go to each park. In general, steer clear of MK on Mondays (though I'm a hypocrite for saying that, I'm heading to MK on a Monday because my birthday is on Monday and I'll be dammed if I let a Monday stop me from visiting the park on my birthday!) 




 My husband and I will be at Pop Century at the same time! This will be our second trip together. I hope your first trip is magical! 




 I didn't even think about that... God damn you, Kev!!! 




 It's first grade! 




 We have way too much time on our hands when the show isn't on. Is it April yet? 




 He looks awful with blonde hair and absolutely sexy with dark hair. But he naturally has red hair! Crazy.  




 Yep, midnight EST 




 I love you! 




 Well then, thank you for helping my parents keep their jobs (both work for the post office) :) 




 I just booked Be Our Guest for my birthday lunch in May. I'm really, really, really, really hoping I can get in for dinner instead though! 




 Stay, with Ewan McGregor and Ryan Gosling.  




 A few days ago, a house exploded due to a gas leak near where I live. The house was blown to pieces, shockwaves felt for miles. Two people were inside, both lived without major injuries. After seeing this, I have no idea how they lived let alone walked away practically unscathed. 




 I can stand to watch almost anything. But the hair trap scene in Saw IV? Nope.  




 I thought I was the only one who does this. I started doing this hard blinking voluntary twitch thing a few years ago. I thought maybe it was a side effect of a medicine I was one - it seemed to start about the same time I started new meds - but after stopping the meds the hard blinks never went away. I also have bad anxiety so I've also thought it could be a coping mechanism for that too. I feel tension around my eyes and it only goes away when I hard blink. I've mentioned the twitch to doctors and they've never heard of anyone else doing this, so I quit bringing it up during appointments. Even though it is partly voluntary I can't seem to stop doing it.  




 The actors definitely were much too old, but it's never been a huge deal for me. I've been a fan for about 13 years and I only just realized that Snape, Remus, Peter and Sirius were only in the 30s. How it took me so long to realize that is beyond me; I guess the movies just made me "see" the characters as older while reading the books.

God damn you, seventh grade English.  




 One thing that struck me as odd is that you list your GPA as a 3.90 but you graduated cum laude... If you graduated with a 3.90 shouldn't that mean you would have graduated summa cum laude, not cum laude? Sorry if I'm incorrect. 




 The commercials are giving me too many feels. I didn't want to go on a feel trip today.
