 Every single day for the past few months the thought of death has popped in my mind and I visualize as well too. Recently I decided to get these feelings off my chest and let someone know what has been going on in my head. Telling someone a friend that you feel comfortable, going through the sane thing or talk to a professional. I've been talking to one since August but it wasn't until almost a month ago i confessed to how i was feeling. It sucks waking up every day with nothing to look forward to, but telling someone how you feel and maybe meeting others that experience what your going through will help. I'm 21, you are so young do not give up! Keep your head up! Find something that distracts you. I watch movies and tv shows all the time. its the only thing that keeps me have a real smile on my face you are not alone  




 Correct  




 Which actress was originally casted to play Tiffany Maxwell in Sliver Linings Playbook, before Jennifer Lawrence was casted? (Hint this actress won an Oscar) 




 That's what movies are for! Guilty pleasures are the best. I have so many movies that I love that arent the best films but I love romantic movies. Some of them are not the best but I love them anyways like Something Borrowed and some are good like Sleepless in Seattle etc. As long as you enjoy them that all it matters.  




 So I watched the episode, I was wrong about Jeannie being somewhat involved with Lukes death. Look like Dre and his wife worked on it together (wasn't really clear). Overall, it was kind of a filler episode nothing really happened until the end with Marty and Jeannie. But, I saw a preview it looks like the aftermath of Jeannie telling her friend is going to happen next ep season finale. My guess someone gets put to jail.  




 His role in Sliver Linings Playbook, might not have been his best performance but I loved his role and Sliver Linings Playbook 




 Frozen no joke you will be singing the words after 




 Jennifer Lawrence in Sliver Linings Playbook the part where Pat (Bradley) is running after Tiffany after the diner scene where Tiffany said something like "I opened up to you and you judged me" basically I loved everything from that movie  




 Adam Sandler- I do not like his movies anymore.  




 It's hard, but it keeps me going. Find something even minor, it will help.  




 Every week I have something to look forward to. It can be a little thing like a bubble bath or going to see a movie or watching your Tv show. But that keeps me through the week knowing that on that day I'll be doing something fun 




 Yes!I'm excited for the next episode!  




 Now that you mention it, It looks like he planned the shooting  




 Your probably right!  




 To be honest- its just a theory I'm not sure but from what I got from the ep is The DA or whoever Jeannies friend was saying something like are you sure you want to do this, it will cause trouble etc. Then Lucas got shot? HMMM I think Jeannie might of said something that should of been kept a secret and it end up lucas being killed  




 I would just watch the whole series because in the show the characters do mention things that happen in the series and just knowing everything makes it easier  




 I thought the ep was going to be about the shooting because they showed it in the preview from last week. This ep only showed it at the endbut I guess we'll find out  about the aftermath this upcoming week. I like that the writers are finally going to show whats the whole deal between marty and jeannie. I think Jeannie caused this to happen because it looked like she told her client dirt on Dolla Hyde.  




 i was a bit disappointed too, but its hard to fit all the characters in the movie and get decent amount of screen time. I hope it does well because I do miss the characters and the show. I wonder if there is a new movie it will be her being a FBI agent. That was the plot for season 4 if it was picked up and it was kinda hinted in the movie with the Leo and Veronica scene  




 I thought it was good! It was nice to see many of the characters. I do hope more movies come from this. What about you? 




 Im def looking into getting it at the bookstore or amazon 




  I recently watched the series ever since I've been super psyched to watch the film. So I liked the film, but I don't know if it loved. I thought it was neat to bring everyone back to the reunion. I do hope for more movies because Veronica Mars is one of my favourite characters ever and I do hope more movies are made. 




 I just joined  lol i'm up for discussions  




 I don't know if this counts, but I was shocked that Sandra Bullock got nominated and won for the Blind Slide  




 Sleepless in Seattle  




 Pitch Perfect 




 She sounds crazy 




 50/50 




 You'll feel relieved after 




 That's okay, good luck on your stats assignment! It's good to let it all out! 




 Thank you for the comment, I'm scared because in the past I had told people about my dad having cancer and they don't respond so I'm scared that they are going to have the same reactions but I want to join a support group where I can meet others in similar situations but I will tell my friends I just got to get the courage too 




 At least you told your friends which I have to starting doing. 




 You should tell a professional, I haven't told my friends but I will soon because its important to have support group. It wasn't a easy thing to do, but now I know that i have it i feel a little bit better 




 CORRECT!  




 Walk to remember 




 Young-adult movie where the main male character makes a bet with his step sister who he has lots of sexual tension with and tries to sleep with this girl, but he ends up following in love with her. GUESS the movie! 




 Emma Stone- Oliver Penderghast in Easy A
Tiffany Maxwell and Pat in Sliver Linings Playbook
 




 I think Matthew won also because he has been known for his romantic stupid movies and he reinvented his career. He has been doing dramas recently and this is the first one that caught our eye and the academys 




 American Hustle 




 I would make the presenters be more entertaining, some of them are great but some are boring.
