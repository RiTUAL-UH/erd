 I have some hobbies, things that I used to think that I liked to do. 

But I've come to realize that all of those things are really just distractions. I do them and I can't forget about feeling like shit for a little while. 

I don't derive any happiness from the act of doing those things.  




 I've have bouts of depression since I was a teenager (I'm 33)

I've only recently recognized that I have depression (after hospitalization because I wanted to kill myself) but looking back I've had it basically forever. 

I started taking medication 3 months ago and I feel better. But only just. I'm not great, I'm not happy.  I'm 'ok'.

I don't even remember a time when I was happy. 

What's the point if I'm only going to be 'ok' for the rest of my life?

I'm running his build and it is sweet 




 This is a huge change for both of you. It's totally natural to be stressed about it. 

I think you'd be more excited if you guys had been together for a bit and he was coming back from a trip or extended stay somewhere.  But, as you said, you guys don't have that experience yet. You don't know that it's something to look forward to. 

The thing is, it IS something to look forward to.

It's going to be stressful and you're going to argue and you're going to have bad days but you're both going to be with the one that you love and get to see them everyday. It's not going to be super happy times every minute but you guys can make it work if you want it (and I think it's obvious that you both want it). 

You don't have to lay all your stress on him now but I'd suggest that you make sure to communicate when he's there with you. That's the key to keeping things smooth.  




 I used the one for the 360 and loved it. 

I hadn't realized that they came out with one for the One. 

That's getting shipped to me immediately.  




 Just because he doesn't have a plan for the future doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't want you as a part of his future. Some people just aren't planners. 

You should talk to him and ask where he sees you guys going in the relationship. Does he even want to get married?  You don't need to give him an ultimatum but you need to tell him that you need this conversation to happen even if it makes him uncomfortable. 

You have a right to know what his plans are for the future of your relationship. Or, if he doesn't have specific plans, just a general sense of where he wants it to go. 

Does he want to get married? Does he want to get married but not right now? Does he just want to date you long term?

And then, you need to decide, based on his answers, if that's acceptable to you. Would you be ok staying with him knowing he wants to get married, just not immediately? Would you be ok if he never wanted to marry but still wanted a family with you?

Good luck, I hope everything works out well for you two.  




 I understand you feeling boring because your boyfriend hasn't had a 'first' with you. 

But, you should listen to him when he says that he doesn't think you're boring. That's just your low self-confidence talking. 

Also, the thing is, a lot of times the first time you do something, it isn't that great. 

Instead of being caught up in being his 'first' whatever, you could try focusing on being his best something. Look at his interests and find something that you're into or would like to try. Something that you can really get into and do with him and he can have the best time ever doing it. 

I'm not just talking about sexual things, it could be any interest.

He has chosen you as the girl he wants to be with so believe me, he's already having a great time doing some things with you. Honestly, doing things with someone you like to be around is so much better than doing it by yourself. 

The flip side of this is since he is more experienced, think of all the first that you can have. Even if he has done it before, you haven't and that makes it special. 

I would also suggest to him to stop telling you that he's done things before and if you're asking him, stop that. 

It doesn't help your confidence and it also doesn't matter.

So what if it isn't your first slice of pizza, does that make it any less delicious?  I say no.  




 Of course you have a right to be jealous, you always have a right to your feelings. 

What you need to ask yourself is if you think the jealousy is coming from a place of truth or just a feeling you're having. What I mean is, are you jealous because you think your boyfriend is thinking about/planning/already doing something inappropriate or are you jealous just because he's talking to pretty girls.

From your post I think it may be the latter. 

That being said you need to talk to him further about this. Tell him that you are feeling uncomfortable that he only talks to pretty girls and you'd like it if he talked to you more (in French). 

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for his practice time to be split between you and his Skype conversations. 

Maybe suggest that he have a Skype conversation with you if in person is too intimidating right now. 

I would like to add that I am inclined to believe that his preference for talking to French-speaking girls is probably innocent. My guess is that he feels more relaxed speaking with them than men or older people and so he's able to get better practice.  




 Or you could find a book and order it online. 

I enjoy going to bookstores which is why that was my first thought. 

I think it's really great that you're trying to make things better instead of just letting things go on the same way. 

And your fianc sounds like he really supports you which is AWESOME. 

It sounds like you have a great relationship and I wish you guys nothing but happiness and orgasms.  




 I think #1 you need to talk to your fianc about these things. 

Let him know that you get distracted and that you want to not be distracted. Maybe you guys can come up with a solution together. 

You could try setting a time limit like you're only going to touch each other for 5 minutes and then you take a break. It will add a component of anticipation to your play. 

Additionally, the research that you are doing into more interesting things, I'm going to suggest that you involve your fianc. Ask him look at what you're looking at. Go to a book store and pick out a book that you guys can read together. You guys can discuss things that look fun to both of you that you want to try (now and later). 

And you could incorporate those fantasies into your current play. Find a position or act that turns you on and then you guys can talk about it in bed. Thinking about that could keep you in the moment.  




 I should say, in no way do I think he is deserving of anyone's time. 

However, I can't make that decision for her which is what I was trying to say. 

My wife cheated on me and I would never consider reconciliation with her but not everyone feels the same as I (or you) do. 

I know two different couples who have moved past infidelity and are still together but I don't know that I could ever do that.  




 You can't get stuck on the what ifs. 

All you can do is look forward.  I think it's good that you have your own place away from him. You need time to think on things and what you want to do going forward and it will be easier if you're not around him. 

You need to figure out what YOU want to do. Not what he wants or what his mom or friends want. Not what your family wants, what YOU want.  You're the only one who can make this decision and that's the way it should be because you're the one who has to live with it. 

I understand things are shitty now. I totally get what you're saying about your chaotic emotions. 

I'm going through a divorce right now and in many ways I'm in the same place. 

But things will get better. I'm not saying you'll feel better about what he did but you will find a way to move past it, either with him or without. 

 




 As you stated having learned from this sub, communication is key!

You did what you could to keep the lines of communication open. Asking about new things he wanted to try, making time in your (understandably) busy schedule to be with him and have sex, etc. 

The thing is, he didn't do everything that HE could. 

I can totally understand you feeling like a failure because of what he has done but what you need to remember and what you will believe in time is that it is not your fault. At all. 

This is his failing. He had insecurities, as we all do, but instead of dealing with them maturely with a therapist or by discussing them with you, he sought sex from strangers. 

He probably is sorry and his willingness to open himself and his movements to you speaks to his regret. 

What you need to decide is if you think you'd ever be able to trust him again. 

If you decide to continue the relationship you guys definitely need therapy together. You need to figure out how to move past this and you need to learn how to communicate with each other. 

But, if you don't want to continue the relationship then no one can fault you for that decision. And making that decision doesn't indicate failure on your part. 

I repeat, this is his failure. 

Good luck.  




 You are definitely not wrong to want to be in touch with your sexuality. 

It is as much a part of you as your eyes or fingers. 

I am not a religious person at all but humans are sexual creatures, we have to be or none of us would be here. It's how we reproduce!  I don't see why there's any reason you can't be comfortable with who you are both sexually and spiritually. 

What you need to do is find people who you can talk to about things in a positive way. Maybe a therapist or your school counselor. Also, your friend that you mentioned (the veteran) might be a good choice since you've already spoken with him about your history and he's been supportive. 

Whatever you do, know that there is nothing wrong with wanting or enjoying sex. There's nothing wrong with you, no matter what your family/culture are telling you. 

Good luck!
 




 So I found a note book my wife is writing to her boyfriend or lover or whatever he is. 

Apparently it's his birthday today and she's been trying to come up with something special to do for him and her idea is to write down song lyrics that remind her of him and 'bring him closer to her heart'

Here's the irony: the last song she's written in the book (so far) is I Won't Give Up by Jason Mraz. She's writing to him a song about not giving up on someone at the same time that she's cheating on her husband. Here's the lyrics if you've never heard the song:

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up, I'm still looking up.

Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
