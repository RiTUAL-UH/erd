 ..how did Dobby produce a hover charm for Harry to take the blame for? 




 Harry still got a warning when Dobby used the hovering charm in CoS. 

 




 I agree that it got worse with each revision.
 









 There were no wiz or witchards in Little Whinging and they had to use  means of transport that were untraceable. It still makes Nymphadora's packing spell a bit questionable.

The ministry was against Harry after the tri-wizard tourney (esp. Umbridge) so why wasn't a packing charm noted, when a hovering charm was? 




 Perhaps Albus let the ministry know what was going on.
 




 HA! Interesting. The bible is the best work of fiction. 




 Yes.
 




 It wasn't all of PJ, but I would love to revisit the Tibetan Freedom show in 97. I even met Ed. 




 Wiki says that Fluffy, while in the forest for a bit, was sent back to Greece by Dumbledore. 




 I was in second grade, 1983, and we were lining up to wash our hands before lunch which was back by the place we hung our coats and bags. This girl who was not there that day had left her umbrella there the day before. 

Long story short, I picked it up, opened it in the queue, as a result I got two firm swats by the blackboard in front of the class.

The kicker was, the teacher's name was Mrs. Slaughter. 









 I would assume over time the magic would wear off in both instances. 




 A: Comet 




 Paddy and Mick were walking along a street in London. Paddy looked in one of the shop windows and saw a sign that caught his eye. The sign read:
"Suits 5.00 each, Shirts 3.00 each, Trousers 4.50 per pair".
Paddy said to his pal "Mick look at these prices! We should buy a whole lot of those and when we get back to Ireland we could make a fortune.
Now when we go in you stay quiet, okay?
Let me do all da talking 'cause if they hear our accents, they might think we're thickos from Ireland and try to screw us. I'll put on me best English accent.
"Roight ye are Paddy, I'll keep me mouth shut, so I will. You do all da business" said Mick.
They go in and Paddy said in a posh voice "Hello my good man. I'll take 50 suits at 5.00 each, 100 shirts at 3.00 each, and 50 pairs of trousers at 4.50 each. And oyll back up me truck ready to load 'em on, so I will."
The owner of the shop said quietly "You're from Ireland, aren't you?"
"Well....... yes" said a surprised Paddy. "How did you know?"
The owner replied, This is a dry-cleaners." 




 Well, he was talking about their duel, so it would have been when Grindlewald had the wand of destiny. 




 Search it on youtube. 

I would give it an A- 




 Damn WB.
 




 Oh noes.
 




 I don't know. All I know is when you watch *The Greater Good* there is a link to help with the kickstarter. 




 This is exciting! I tear up at the end of *The Greater Good* every. single. time. 

I wonder what they could do with the Snape story arc? 




 Now I'm on youtube searching for *The Greater Good* again... 




 You're correct. Dropped them off at the front gates, and everyone was staring.
 




 Dumbledore says that he was "a shade more skillful" and that Gellert pretty much gave up at the end.

*Kings Cross* chapter of DH. 









 That was just a one off due to Sirius being on the loose.

..and a bit of a hurry-up. 




 It does take about ten hours.
 




 I agree that it was first Lucius, then Severus. After Lucy fucked up in the DoM though, Riddle had very little love for his general. 




 I read somewhere that it all boils down to tradition. I've asked this question before, and that was pretty much the consensus. 




 YES! Or when they tell the cops they are Trevor Lahey or Corey Trevor. HA!

[8.5]

No shit, my FB tag is TrevorLahey 




 Beg your pardon, but I thought I was allowed to post what was factual.

There is a one hour difference between the two posts, the second is just more in depth.

I'm really not trying to start a row here, just misunderstanding perhaps.
 




 Does that stuff work? 




 Beg your pardon Miss head, but how is speaking the truth rude? 









 /u/Obversa is sore because I called her out. 









 Cheers! 




 That's it. 




 Pick your favorite [chapter art](http://i.imgur.com/IJQ13E5.jpg) 




 All you did was elaborate on what /u/hntjw said an hour before you. 




 Someone once posted a theory that it involved semen on or near the dead body. That was kinda twisted. 




 She admitted in an interview that he retrieved it and kept it. "Strong feat for a rat, I know." 

Sorry I have no source, but it's fact. 




 Yes. 




 ..made me sad. 









 How will Ricky rickyism his name? Or Bubs even? 




 I think in the later seasons, they had one of those empty prop glasses that look like they're full, and edited in the ice clinking noise.
 




 Yes, it's confirmed.

 I was stoned, just coming off a three hour binge, and I was trying to talk like Ricky. insinuating=inseminating 




 "You don't have to come at me with a fucking leaf comb!" 




 He did! I forgot about that. I love Ricky when he finds out who got Trinity pregnant. 




 Nobody is fucking saying anything about them going to jail at the end of every season? 









 *cough* Yea maaan.. 




 Ricky takes an eight to ten year old Trinity into the gas and go again, and Jacob is there. Ricky lays his gun on the counter, Jacob thinks he's robbing the joint. Then Trin grabs the gun and shoots it.

My pointer is, he ends up insinuating Trinity so they could make a baby when he is at least eight years older, and he watched her growed up. To me, that is really creepy. 




 I love the bottle kids!  




 Here's a few hash coins. 




 That's good. 




 No. Albus removed it from Hogwarts. Hermyown stole it from his study after he died.

I doubt she would put it back. 




 Mine is the clearing stick. Bring that back because it's fucking funny every single time. 




 It sure is, except the third. 




 Time turners are not as great a machina as you think they are. She said that after PoA was released, She instantly regretted writing them. I think they're a bit of a bullshit scapegoat if you ask me. 




 Back to the Future? That franchise was great and all for the 80s, but no. They did not handle time travel very well.
 




 harry does not think to save Sirius a secound time in the Ministary by running to the room of the time turners to set the time back ten minutes to kill Bellatrix

He couldn't have anyway. He couldn't even *crucio* Bella. 




 I don't have the interview at hand, but She says about five hours, or you are Siriusly messing with human nature. 




 STAHP IT RON, STAAAHP! 




 I agree. How long was Fox the Gordon Ramsay network FFS? Everything from the early oughts is now fading into obscurity due to Netflix, HBO, and other cable networks. 




 I am a Scooby-Doo fan, and that animated show has been hashed and re-hashed into many different series. There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a "jumping the shark" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.

Addendum, I love the Firefly reference. I have not seen one episode of that show, and just recently realized it was a thing. 




 I live in a fairly rural area of Ohio, and people pronounce the days with -DEE on the end instead of -DAY. 




 That is exactly who I thought would be charged with the task. 




 I would assume his body was cremated unceremoniously. 














 You must iron you hands or slam your ears in the oven, carry on. 




  Frank and Alice were tortured beyond belief, but refused to (I'm assuming here) to give Voldemort any information. 

Uh-uh. Voldemort had vanished October 31, 1981, and Bella, Rodolphus, and Rabastan with the possible aid from Barty Jr tortured Neville's parents. They were looking for information as to where Riddle could be. 




 What the fuck does that even mean? Two smokes, let's go for being so stupid. 




 Absolutely, it goes on over the damn hills. 

Reason #394 that GoF is the worst movie. 




 Totally on my dime. 




 You're right, they do. =o/

Even Mundungus, the filthy git. 




 Yea, I bet Radcliffe had to do a shit ton of voiceovers for that flick.
 




 Yea, it is supposed to be just the quidditch pitch. 200 meters by 60 meters at best. 




 This question  is in the common questions on the sidebar in the great hall, you may find what you are looking for there. 




 I reckon it's because of different directors. 




 How do you dust it all?
 




 RIP Phil. 




 This is a troll account. First day. 




 Is this bullshit? Because I don't really want to do that much work if it's bullshit. 




 Got your back on that downvote, and I whole heartedly agree. 




 Classic Worf. 




 PEANUT BUTTER AND JAAAAAAAAM! 




 I'm not sure if we ever learned his house, but I would assume he was a Gryff. 




 Nice. 




 What did Slughorn ever do that was evil? He fought at the BoH. In case you hadn't noticed Snape was working against Voldemort for over 16 years of his life. Sure Draco was a prat, but he came around in the end. 




 Not all snakes are evil. Draco, Slughorn, Snape. I'm sure their are others I'm forgetting, but they aren't all evil. 




 I like that one.. 




 Nothing specific.

I'm Thornquill. 




 Yup, I just finished that episode, it was written on the back of his neck. 




 That's it! 




 Jacob was in season 1, episode 1. He was working the counter when 
Ricky told him ti give him two packs of smokes at that convenient store. 




 Better a rat at the Burrow than a rat in Azkaban. 




 Man, I was a bit of a bully myself in high school. There were only certain cliques everyone could fit into, and people did what their friends did.

But the fact is, by the time I was 18, I grew out of that bullspit and realized what life is about. I have three daughters, and the three of them are happy and they have gotten nothing but As on their report cards for two years running. (that's top marks for you Brits)

I respect James, because I see a bit of myself in him and Sirius. Someone who learned how to live properly after making a few mistakes. 




 "It was love, Harry.. it was love." 




 Year of Darkness.

It's Neville, Luna, Ginny and them while the trio are hunting horcruxes.
 




 Fitting flair. 




 This is why I drink.
 




 Q was feeding Jean-Luc a line about how he lost his powers, and Picard didn't believe him. 




 ACME already invented the bat-man wings/costume. 




 My bad. 




 That's where I get my rocket powered roller skates. 




 Isn't the Riddle house in Great Hangleton? 




 Sure it wasn't ACME? 




 Hidden camera porn because I like to watch. 




 Not if you're tethered to a tree. 




 A: Because he's married. 




 I figured out which episode it came from. I can't remember the name, but it's the one where Q was stripped of his powers. 




 I don't see it as much as splitting one's soul but rather shattering it. Each horcrux is a container that holds a piece of a soul, and not directly half of what was left each time.

Otherwise, why would his appearance change. 




  since Voldemort felt it when a horcrux was destroyed

Only in the film. In the book, Dumbledore says that he isn't human enough to know. 




 The bar.
