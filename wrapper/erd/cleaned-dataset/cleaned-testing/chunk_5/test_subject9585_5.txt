 That's about the 4th repost I've seen today. And I've only been on here for about 10 minutes.  




 Your life must be so awesome 




 If I had a penny for every time I've heard or seen this phrase on reddit I'd probably have 14 cents. 




 Just as I thought OP was a cool guy 




 What has reddit become...  




 Fucking hell reddit, grow up! You all sound like a bunch if 12 year olds... When did it come to this 




 To be fair, OP never said the turtle was alive...  




 Stupid people piss me off 




 The fact that you claim it's yours when it clearly isn't makes me more mad than it probably should. 




 Would you rather I have a username such as "childrapist4004"  




 You're an awful boyfriend.  









 Why so much One Direction on reddit? 




 Repost 




 Galaxy * 




 Kill yourself  




 You mean.. there are other ways? 




 Repost. OP, you are a fag 




 you mean find this kids parents. 




 Happened to me way too many times...  




 What is this? A screenshot for ants?  









 I just saw this on my news feed and KNEW it would make its way to reddit. It's the little victories...
