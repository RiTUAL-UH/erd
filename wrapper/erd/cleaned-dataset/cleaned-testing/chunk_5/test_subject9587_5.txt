 Yeah, you might be able to lay down across the seats, even (if the arm rests pull up). 




 Too soon on Vikes. 




 Cowboys.  




 Like *Panic Room*? 




 Was a fumble.   In the scrum they found a Ram had the ball.  Because it was under 2 mins, only the fumbling player can recover the ball and advance it, so they marches it back to the spot of the fumble.

No replay from upstairs.  There should have been? But I don't think there was any clear recovery on camera, so reversal would have been tough. 




 This game was absurd.  




 Ha.  Should a gone down. 




 Idiot announcer.  Time Out means nothing when you run the play clock to 1! 




 Two knees means Seattle fields a punt with 35 seconds.  Looking grim, but crazier things.

 Actually just checked. It is at 12% 




 Obviously.  That is why I asked A question with a strict mathematical value attached.

 TD here makes it rough for Seattle.  Win probably % probably drops under 10% , right?

 That is just because he is not a human.  He is from a race of super beings who excel at defense like it is second nature, and he has not learned the ways of our people.

Yet. 




 I make mimosas but use gin instead of champagne.  Faster and still great. 




 Also it appears that the Seahawks are better at home.  You know,  like almost every team. 




 You had to imagine that the media would slobber over the Seahawks for making the "tough decision" - and then weave that in to any narrative they could.

It's all b.s.  Seahawks made a mistake and did their best to minimize it.  Now they are under performing and the Rams are playing well. 




 Rams dominating the LOS, plus have quadrupled their sack total for the year.   Also, one sick special teams play. 




 The bears did this once with Devin Hester (because obv he is returning it!).  But, it got called back for a holding. 




 This game is for me.  My second favorite play in the world is the fake direction punt return.  My first is the Utah Pass.

Go Rams, Go! 




 Virologist here, and I just heard a presentation by a gentleman working on Chikungunya (which was great).  I knew the basics before the talk, but was really taken by:  1)  How debilitating the disease can be, 2)  How long symptoms can persist, and 3)  How little we know about it / few treatments we have.

It seems that this most recent outbreak has really swept through the Caribbean, even including Florida. I think it is almost assured to make it to Mexico.  Viruses in the news all the time now . . . 




 Google, "Jameis Winston sexual assault".  There have been numerous investigations (by the press) indicating that FSU and Tallahassee police likely suppressed and possibly outright ignored investigations into a young woman's complaints that Winston sexually assaulted her.   




 Damn straight.  Ditto "Broncos". 




 Umm.  Rapes?  What about the rapes? 




 There seems to be a huge omission in this thread.   People are bringing up stealing soda and maybe signing autographs and being generally stupid ("FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY!"), but no one has mentioned that he is very likely a rapist?  Possibly multiple times?  The investigations of which were likely covered up by FSU? It would be very foolish to think that this issues won't resonate with NFL GMs, and it likely causes him to fall in a manner similar to what happened with Aaron Hernandez.  I would be embarrassed if the Broncos drafted him.  

Tl; dr - Likely rapist will be drafted, but later than based on talent alone.

 The game tying goal seemed horribly unlucky, too.  Boo.

Oh well, points are points. GG Leafs. 




 Exactly.  Talk the talk, walk the walk etc.  I mentioned in a comment earlier that these Chargers seem similar to last year's Chiefs, at least with respect to the defense.  

Playing Bortles, Smith, Manuel, and Carr will do that for you.  ( I know Carr lit them up - but doesn't that support my argument? ) 




 I am currently reading a biography of Ramanujan/Hardy called, "The Man Who Knew Infinity."  Totally awesome, and could definitely spark a flame of interest.  




 See, I am the opposite - I think there are places for ties.

Imagine an NFL where there was no overtime at all.  If the game ends in a tie, that's it - tie.  (Obv, postseason would be different.  Since it is so special, I would just go ahead and guarantee one offensive possession per team).

I am just showing the numbers from the years since the realignment, [here] (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1 match=game year_min=2002 year_max=2013 game_type=R playoff_round= game_num_min=0 game_num_max=99 week_num_min=0 week_num_max=99 game_day_of_week= game_time= time_zone= game_location= surface= roof= stadium_id= temperature_gtlt=lt temperature= game_result= overtime=Y league_id= team_id= team_conf_id= team_div_id= opp_id= opp_conf_id= opp_div_id= team_off_scheme= team_def_align= opp_off_scheme= opp_def_align= conference_game= division_game= tm_is_playoff= opp_is_playoff= tm_is_winning= opp_is_winning= tm_scored_first= tm_led= tm_trailed= c1stat= c1comp=eq c1val= c2stat= c2comp=gt c2val= c3stat= c3comp=gt c3val= c4stat= c4comp=gt c4val= order_by=game_date).

Would it really be so bad if there were this many ties every year?  Ties wouldn't automatically be de-facto losses because the half-game in the standings would likely compete with several other teams who have tied.  Additionally, it allows for interesting strategic opportunities late in games, deciding whether or not a tie is sufficient, or if you need to go for the win.
 




 The answer:  zero ridiculous, 100 awesome. 




 I want all orange ones.  I fear I shall never get them.

Are orange pants too much to ask for in this life?  ARE THEY!?!??! 




 My life has gone:

Born in Colorado

Move to Utah

Grade School back in Colorado

Undergrad in Iowa (so, I have lived!)

Graduate School in Florida

Now in Wisconsin.

All have their charms.  I miss Colorado for sports and mountain fun. 




 I am not disrespecting the Chargers at all, but their season has a very Chiefsy feel to it so far.  They punched the world champs in the mouth, sure, but their DBs playing well so far?  Palmer, Smith, Manuel (since benched), Carr (who had a career game), Wilson, and Bortles.  It isn't the stretch of 3rd stringers that the Chiefs feasted on to start 9-0 last year, but it does inflate the effectiveness of their defense, which is why DVOA for them places them a little lower than you'd think.

Again, not taking anything away from them, especially since Rivers is the MVP at the quarter pole, but they remain a flawed team.  Maybe Oliver is the solution at RB, but they are still on their 4th center, and as Chargers, are prone to hilarious meltdowns (it's okay, Bolts Fans, we are too, kinda).

They get to be a little scary for now.  But when we punch them in the mouth they'll see that it ain't easy pacing the AFC West.  Then in December, we'll relieve them of that responsibility for good. 




 No worries, man.  Just fuckin' with ya. 




 [Aww, don't be so modest] (http://youtu.be/eF6ZSLDwLhM?t=9s) 




 It is also currently a very small number of plays that have to deal with this rule, so unless it becomes an issue through frequency, or one high-impact play (like the Navarro Bowman rule), I don't think they'll care enough to alter it.

And, with respect to "ball and feet matter", I meant in relation to positioning on the field.  To score touchdowns, or determine field position, or get out of the endzone to avoid a safety, no one cares where your shoulder is - it should be the same for the LoS. 




 [Col. Angus?] (http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a7a_1349546320)

 It amuses me that your three triple posts have acquired a different number of negative votes. 




 I like that all three of your triple-posts have a different amount of down votes.  




 Nine first downs all day - I wouldn't be happy, either. 




 We Are 12! 




 I think this rule needs to be changed in the offseason.  There is no other time in football when the position of the body matters at all (it is always feet or ball).  Not to mention shoulders and fingers and such bullshit.

They should change it to either the feet need to be behind the LoS, or the ball **can not** pass the LoS completely (think of the rule for a Safety).  Also, I don't think you should be able to cross the LoS, come back, and then throw it.  Once the runner has passed it, then the play is a running play and any forward pass will be ruled illegal.

It seems to me that in an era of many burgeoning mobile quarterbacks (Wilson, Luck, Kaepernick, Newton, Smith, etc, etc) this rule will be exploited more and more, and I think it is evident that the Seahawks are looking to exploit this rule in plays designed specifically to go right to the edge of what is legal.  Not hating on them for doing it, it is just an observation.

I mean, after all, they can't call it on every play, right?  (/s) 




 Came for the AFC West showdown.     I hope whoever loses does so in a heartbreaking fashion. 




 I saw one that said:

**C**ard

**B**oard

**S**ign

That's pretty okay. 




 5 minute drill time - Jets' O never touchew the ball again. 




 Very poor execution this half.  Better step it UP D. 




 I heard, "IT'S TOO EASY!!!"  Awesome either way. 




 That catch was actually absurd. 




 Graphic shows Manning as a Bronco, but not Favre as a Viking.  Just inconsistent and a little funny. 




 It is known. 




 Exactly.  Then, he called him Julius five seconds later while watching the same replay. 




 Dan Fouts.  Usually he is merely annoying, but today he is absolutely intolerable.  Also, he's saying blatantly incorrect things.  On that TD, he said two blatantly false things,  and mixed up the Thomases. 




 Very simple, actually:  Denver o line is under performing something awful.  Absolutely sabotaging the entire offense.  D lost trevethan, but is playing well. 




 Better than all. 




 Yeah, they are being really shitty. 




 Small sample size.  Talk at the end of the year. 




 Every player with a goal can say the same.

The whole team has the yips, except Varly.
 




 Okay, I am on fire.  Now what? It's getting real hot.  Pl advdsi

 If you mean in a philosophical way, yeah.  It's kinda Dadaist in how it makes you realize that hockey is meaningless and nothing will ever make you happy.

 Very possible.  




 ITT:  Avs fans too low, Wild fans too high.  No one should jump off a bridge or tatoo, "2015 Stanley Cup Champions" on their neck.  Avs bros, relax, it'll be okay; sometimes you get your shit tossed.   




 So, it might be hyperbole to say the Avs are losing every 1-on-1 battle, but . . .  




 My fave from them.  Haven't tried them all yet, to be fair. 




 New Glarus Spotted Cow.  Wife just drank the last one.  Switching to whiskey. 




 Avs looked really reticent.  The last five minutes were better, but we were fortunate to get out of that only down 1. 




 Is it weird that every time I see MAC my first thought is Arnold Schwartzenegger screaming it to a bald black man who is out of his mind with grief / vengeance? 




 MY FAVORITE PLAYER EVER WAS STEVE ATWATER AND HIS BIGGEST MISTAKE WAS PLAYING FOR THE JETS FOR ONE WHOLE SEASON. 




 Fair enough, thanks for the perspective.  I hate the Dodgers, too. 




 Yeah, thanks; I just saw that one.  It confused me because the post title is kind of backwards, and it wasn't the bleacher video that you posted. 




 Gonna give my two cents here.

1.  Apparently if Kronke move the Rams, he wants to be the only NFL franchise in LA - he will not want the Chargers or Raiders to join him there.  If he is truly adamant about this, I could see the league disallowing the Rams' move to LA, in favor of the AFCW teams.

2.  As for Davis' contention that he will swap to the NFC - that seems very odd to me.  There is such a rich tradition of the Raiders in the AFL and then AFC that I am hesitant to believe that this is anything more than a bargaining chip to get a new stadium for the Raiders.  I mean, Al Davis practically built the AFC, helped with the merger, etc.  To be fair, though, the Raiders have been awful and have a terrible culture of losing in the last decade+, it may be that Mark Davis wants a fresh start, and that could include the realignment.

3.  The Chargers 100% should move.  I get the feeling that a majority of their fan base is in he greater LA area anyway, and I don't think the San Diego die-hards (of which there are some) would completely bail on the franchise if it moved a little north. 

4.  Obviously, if the Raiders bail, we get Seattle back.  The Raiders are far more hated as rivals, and it would suck to lose them, but Seattle is a nice consolation prize.  Battling them twice a year would be fun.

5.  If I was given God Powers, I would prefer that the Rams move, Kronke swallows his pride and allows the Chargers to go with him, and the Raiders get a new stadium in the Bay Area.  Additionally, the 49ers become the "Santa Clara 49ers".

tl;dr - Kronke's stubbornness is big, San D and Oakland both need stadiums, and while losing the Raiders as division rivals would suck, Seattle would be a great rival, too. 

edit:  also, you should x-post this to /r/nfl. 




 A fair point, and I don't often pay attention to contract deals and such from other teams - but how many non-max extensions of rookie contracts under the new CBA have happened?  It seems like a small sample size. 




 Yeah, I know.  You guys fucking pummeled us for like 15 straight years until we became relevant in '77.  The wikipedia article on [our rivalry] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broncos%E2%80%93Raiders_rivalry) is actually put together really well.

In the 60's and 70's, you assholes were 29-10-2 against us.  Fucking brutal. 

 




 The stories that I saw mentioned that the language in the new CBA with regards to non-max contract extensions on rookie deals was very, very vague.  So, most likely what happened was they put together a deal that they thought was fine, but the vagaries of the CBA made it not okay, so they had to adjust it.  I wouldn't say that Connely "screwed up" - it was more like trying to get the right form through a government bureaucracy - and filled out flawlessly, to boot. 




 I say this.  All.  The.  Time.  My wife still doesn't understand.  




 Oh, I am not saying that he can't get 6 TDs and take the record outright this week - just that it is most likely to happen vs. The Santa Clara 49ers.  I'd put it at something like:

5%  Jets

60% 49ers

30% Chargers

5% Patriots or Later 




 Yeah, they would really love that.  I already heard Nantz/Simms talk about it once.
