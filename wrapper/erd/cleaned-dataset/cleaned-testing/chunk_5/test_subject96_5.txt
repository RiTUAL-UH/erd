 That's what the drones want you to think. 




 This looks like some real, old school SF. 

At first I was thinking Asimov's robot stories, then I thought "With Folded Hands".

Looking forward to this. Hope it's good. 














 Gotham is a show with some serious issues. I keep feeling that there's a very good to great show hiding just beneath the surface, but right now it's a bit of a mess. 

Be forewarned, there are people who hate the show with a white hot, inchoate rage. The comment section over at the AV Club is filled with these types. I get the idea that they're angry because they want an actual Batman TV show and they're getting this instead.

I find it to be an enjoyable hour of television for what it is.  Sean Pertwee is great as Alfred and the rest of the cast is decent to very good, for the most part. 



















 One of things that really bugs me about this season is the sloppiness, inconsistency and continuity issues. I mean, which firm's e-mails did the hackers get again. When Alicia and Will exchanged those sexy e-mails, they were working for Lockhart Gardner, which is a completely different entity than Florick Agos/Florick, Lockhart   Agos.

Anyway, It's established early on that Prady and Alicia are both Dems. In S06E09 we have the DINO (Democrat In Name Only) spot. 

In a heavily Democratic area like Cook County, the Democratic Primary is essentially the election, but you still have to have an election. You can't say that the winner is the SA-elect.

Moreover, if the election that was potentially spoiled was the Democratic Primary, there's no way that the Dems could have lost a seat in the state legislature if there was a recount. 

Nothing from this whole SA plot makes any sense at all.

 Because most criminals are very, very, stupid. 














 I am amortizing the cost of the battery over the amount of energy it could reasonably be expected to produce. How you intend to use the battery is irrelevant. If you have an issue with my calculations, I'd be interested to hear it. 

As for your calculations, the numbers you're using are way low. To disconnect from the grid you'd probably need at least two, probably three batteries to account for days with low or no sun. Even assuming you do the install yourself, which wouldn't be allowed by Tesla at this point, you haven't even added in the cost of an inverter to your package.

Unless you really want to get off the grid for some reason, grid connected solar with net metering and energy buyback from your electric company makes a lot more economic sense at this point than buying a $3000 battery. 




 Your numbers don't make any sense at all. 

First, let's forget about the 10kWh unit for now. As noted [here](http://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/teslaenergy?via=newsletter source=CSAMedition), the 10kWh unit is for backup applications with weekly cycling. The 7kWh is designed for the daily use we're talking about. 

So, it's $3,000 for the 7kWh unit.  We have a ten year warranty. 10 * 365.25 * 7=25567.5 kWh. That's 11.7 cents per kWh just for the battery.

But wait, how much juice can we get out of that unit every day? 7kWh? No way, unless we repeal the laws of physics.  Tesla states the battery has 92% round trip efficiency. 92% of 7 is 6.44. Then we have to factor in the losses in the inverter. A typical inverter is about 95% efficient. We now have 6.12 kWh or 22346 kWh. 13.4 cents per kWh.

Can we use all that 6.12 kWh every day? Probably not. Cycling a battery down to 0% charge every day is going to kill it way before its time, unless Musk has invented some kind of super new battery. Let's be generous and say we can use 90% of the power every day without damaging the battery. 5.5 kWh per day or 20111 kWh over the battery life. 14.9 cents per kWh.

That's nearly fifteen cents a kWh just for the battery.  That's roughly what grid power costs in a lot of places.  And remember we're not even calculating the cost of the inverter or installation, which is going to be several thousand dollars on top of that.  Plus, I haven't even attempted to calculate the loss of charge capacity over time, which is significant. 
 









 I've heard good things about this show, but it's not available to stream anywhere, so no chance for me to catch up. 




 Just list the work under Freelance - Self-Employed and then list your clients and the work you did for them. 

It's just, are you trying to get a job in healthcare by listing IT stuff on your resume? That might be the issue. You might want to explain that in your cover letter. 









 I think that we understand that 14 year old is not an adult. They can't legally drink, or smoke or drive a car. Heck, in a lot of places they can't even buy a can of spray paint. 

In most states, an adult having sex with a 14 year old is a serious felony that results in serious jail time because someone that age is not mature enough to consent to sex.

Yet when we enter the criminal justice realm, we're ready to lock someone away for the rest of their natural life because of a decision they made when they were 14. To me, that's morally wrong. 




 Obvious troll is obvious. 




 He was 14 when he committed the crime. Doesn't that merit a little mercy? 









 Deadline reports it as "Living On Video", but [this article](http://www.law360.com/articles/648222/hbo-nixes-living-on-video-name-after-tm-challenge) notes trademark issues with the name.  














 I think a stylus would be nice. There are a lot of Apple-loving artists would would like to do artwork on their iPad. 














 Reminds me a bit of "The Drive-In" by Joe Lansdale. 









 I like mine and everyone who got one seems to like it. The keyboard is kinda crappy, so a couple people got other KBs to use with them.

It's a nice tool if you're in a Microsoft environment. You can take it with you everywhere and it's got all the MS apps. The Win8 interface is actually not all that bad on a touchscreen. 




 This movie was great. I wonder why it didn't get a wider release here in the US. I went to go see it with my wife and daughter at my local art theater and the place was packed.

The story was OK, but the animation was just so beautiful to look at. Every scene was a spectacular piece of art. 




 I think they've been coming out with new ones roughly once a year.

I bought Surface Pro 2's for my operations group back in March/April of last year and I remember the 3's came out not that long after. 




 I think that you generally replace lead-acid batteries on a solar installation every six years or so. The Tesla is supposed to last ten years, so not quite twice the lifespan.  




 It's important to note that less than half of the officers killed in the line of duty were killed due to felonious actions, i.e. killed by a perp. Over the last ten years, an average of 50 police officers lost their lives this way each year. 

And the FBI numbers are way low in large part because there is no mandatory reporting.

Canvassing of media reports shows that [at least 1100 people were killed by police in 2014](http://www.killedbypolice.net/kbp2014.html). 









 The EU is way ahead of us here in the USA with respect to energy efficiency requirements. 

For example, I have a high-efficiency, condensing gas boiler heating my home.  I understand these are quite common in Europe, but it took some doing to find someone qualified to install it here. 




 Here you [go](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+2700+square+feet+in+square+meters) 




 Eight of [these](http://www.solar-electric.com/trt16vo225ah.html) gives you just over 10kWh. A four by two array would be about 21" deep and 30" wide.
 




 I'm pretty sure an emergency generator is going to be cheaper over the long-term than any kind of a battery backup. A good generator can last for a long time and it has the advantage of keeping your lights on if you lose power for more than half a day. 




 The longevity might be one factor in Tesla's favor, although lead-acid batteries designed specifically for solar power applications already have pretty good longevity.

While the Tesla solution might be somewhat less trouble than a conventional system, less maintenance, etc, no home house battery is going to be plug-and-play. And if you're already paying to have solar installed, the additional labor to install a battery system is minimal.  




 Homes in the USA are larger than they are in Germany. The average home in the US is just under 2700 square feet.

Also, a large portion of the US is a lot warmer than Germany and homes there require a lot of air conditioning to stay comfortable from late spring through early fall. 




 I'm sorry, your point is what, exactly? 




 As it is, it's still more than twice as expensive as a lead-acid battery setup for your PV system, which is still not economical unless you're planning to live off the grid. 




 The answer is,  it isn't. 

It's smaller and lighter (and prettier), but it's also more than twice as expensive as a lead-acid battery system for your photovoltaic setup, which can be had for around $100/kWh. 














 My biggest question is why would you pay the premium for Li-Ion for home installation? Lithium batteries are great because they're smaller and lighter, which is great if you want to put them in a car or a laptop, but not very important if you're going to stick it in a closet or in your basement.

A standard Lead-Acid photovoltaic battery setup costs around $100/kWh. The big battery from Tesla is $350/kWh. What's the justification for spending two and a half times as much? 




 I agree. I generally have issues with endings, even well done ones. But the SFU ending was pretty much perfect. 



















 Actually, the argument is that the 20 year decline in crime levels that began in the 90's can be traced to the elimination of leaded gasoline. In fact, you can look at other nations and see a similar decline in crime levels tracing back to when they also eliminated leaded gasoline.

Since we know the effects of lead on the developing brain, it's an argument that has a lot of credibility to it. 









 Deadshot was originally more of a [modern cowboy character](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/08/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-275/) before he lost his eye and got the targeting monocle. 

So we're probably seeing his origin story here...unless they're just messing with us.
 




 This would certainly be illegal here in the US. I find it unlikely that it would be legal in the UK.

Best of luck. 









 I graduated high school in 1984, so picking a favorite 80's movie for me is particularly difficult.

I'd have to call it a tie between Empire Strikes Back and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Oh, and there's no way I'm clicking though ten pages for an 80's movie list, so I didn't bother reading the linked article.  









 Just FYI, this isn't my photo or my house . It was forwarded to me by a FOAF. 

Here's a bit of explanation:

The tenant decided, completely on his own, to attempt installation of a french drain. In doing so, from what I understand based on the adjustor's conversation with me, he took a backhoe and basically unearthed the entire foundation. That made the foundation not have any footing, and voila. 




 I think the answer is that we need to take direct control of economic decisions away from computers. Computers should be able to calculate, analyze and advise, but only a human being should be able to buy or sell.

I don't know how we'd do this. The implementation would almost certainly be difficult, perhaps impossible. But if we don't, we'll be living in a world where the economy is increasingly dominated by algorithmic decision making and the ultimate result is not going to be good for humanity. 


































 A mere bag of shells.  




 Well, I'm sure there will be sports on the broadcast channels, but your wouldn't be paying extra for sports cable channels like ESPN, NFL Network, YES, etc.
