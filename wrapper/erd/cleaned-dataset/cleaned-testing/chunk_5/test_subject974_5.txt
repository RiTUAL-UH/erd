 love it - discovered it while reading my daughter's new 2015 Guinness Record book - it's listed as the highest rated tv show of all time or something like that.  




 I see your point - got interesting I thought when she first sees the video - then the end I thought was great!

 wow, you guys are all amazing - thanks for letting me vent! xox 




 right?!?! 




 The straw that broke the camel's back occurred this past Summer when mom got wasted at a family gathering in honor of my dad and tried to drive home.  She got all dramatic and basically threw my dads ashes(in a can) at my 8 year old son who then completely lost it and was crying hysterically.  Same trip I guess my sister was telling other family members that they've always hated my wife and that she was trying to ruin/break-up the family for years etc.  My wife said that was it - she's done. 




 my sister and mom are together a codependent nightmare which over the years has tried the patience of all those around them - sis is a recovering speed/heroin junkie but per mom is "always working so hard and getting so much better" and "misses her brother soo much" ad nauseam. 




 ask a butcher what's in their meatloaf mix - usually a mixture of beef/veal/pork I think.
 




 I recently signed up for a meat CSA at an up-start local butcher shop - 1st Sat of the month I go in and get a box of random meat goodness - all local, farm-raised stuff...love it! 




 stopping by Penzey's on the way home for some Za'tar....finally gonna use the ground goat in my freezer....thanks for the inspiration!
