 You also have to look at the audience. Majority of the Sepang and Singapore audience are tourist/foreigners, especially Aussies. Most would certainly choose only one over the other 




 What /u/FreakyJk means that with the near proximity, there are higher chances of split audience. COTA and Mexico has a larger location gap, which means that Mexicans that are closer to COTA would choose there instead of the Mexican GP.  




 Sepang after Singapore? And that's too near the usual slot for Sepang's Moto GP. I forsee my budget for Sept/Oct will be tighter than usual ;A; 









 he had prosthetic. only the lower part of his foot is crushed so he could still walk  




 Dunno man. It was awesome to see it the first time, with Vampiro marking out. 

But too much of the same thing will make it boring. When I see that gif now for me it's like "yep, a dive and catch" 




 Because they need someone to fill Bryan's slot on Smackdown ASAP? As I said, it was also because they promised the IC Championship match on ER, but it was cut out due to Bryan's injury. IMO the original original content plan for today was that Renee's segment where she interviewed Rollins 




 As with the title, could everyone post their wheel settings in this thread? It would be easier if everything in one place compared to separate thread about FANATEC, Thrustmaster or Logitech littered around.

And also a request, could anybody explain the Steering Saturation and Steering Linearity in this game? Getting a hard time to get a 1:1 steering input with the Thrustmaster T300RS 




 IIRC the world feed (for TV that is) for this year are using SkyF1's commentary. That's what we are getting from Fox in Malaysia. 

But true, the individual broadcasters might be a problem, as well as Bernie who seems like an old fashioned chap 




 I have a feeling the "sudden" decision to have the KotR tournament was due to Daniel Bryan's injury, and the non defense of the Intercontinental title at ER. 

This way, they give the viewers a "title" match, give some talents the needed exposure (Neville), give the network an extra network only show, and still keep the title on Bryan until they figure out how long he will be out. 




 Does all the travelling takes a toll on you? 
And which circuit do you always looking forward to go every year?
Do you think F1 would be more popular if it introduces a legal pay stream?

 




 It should work, as long as the controller is a directInputDevice compatible 














 Depends on your location. It was out for me since 4 hours ago 









 Bloody hell, i never realised that it would lap nearly the same as one would at Spa. And in comparison Mt Panorama is just 6.2km compared to 7km of Spa

 Gee I wonder which engine manufacturer would want to actually make a V8 after investing so much in V6 Vijay? certainty not the one providing your current engine 




 hence his drug abuse. WWE seems to be toning Neville's ability down to keep him from hurting himself and rely on painkillers. 









 /r/firstworldanarchists 




 Had a chance to get Roman to win the KotR and get him over with marks

WWE does not include him in the tournament, and stick him with Rollins storyline instead

Fuck this company 




 kayfabe wise, more surface area to throw your opponent in 




 Dean Ambrose has finally won a PPV Singles Match, stretching back from MITB 2014. 

 




 IT WAS YOUR NOTEPAD! 




 "E C DUB! E C DUB! E C DUB!" 




 Pretty okay match. I mean it was a spot fest in a mark town, so props to that. But the match did nothing in showing Reigns wrestling ability. It only shows he can take bumps. The tag team match was a whole lot more entertaining than this match in terms of wrestling move and in ring skills.

Interestingly I was more entertained by the Big Show's attitude. 




 Basically he needs to be what Rocky Maivia did when he turned into The Rock. They seemed similar. Both pushed to the moon, and got chewed out by the fans. 

The only difference was The Rock was repackaged into a heel, and made it work, but Reigns did not change, and is still hand held through everything.  




 "Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!" 




 nor the fact that most stores activates their games on STEAM as well? 









 Physics told us it wont happen. To do quick release system for engine would introduce high stressed parts, especially on the drivetrain. That does not include the fact that they need to unplug and replug the fuel line, which introduce danger. 

The only real solution would be to make the whole rear detachable. But that would mean a weaker monocoque they wpuld flex and roll and in the end disintegrate the car. To renforce it would mean added weight. And there is no way they would want a heavy car because that would offset any advantage they would have in the first place 




 Quick, yes. But one minute change? No.  




 Only the lap times. The speeds is most likely there since there are less aero drags 




 It takes nearly half a minute to change a front wing. And that't just taking off four pins, taking off the old wing, put on a new one, and putting on a pin again. 

An engine much more complicated. Considering that the modern engine now is ICE, where it interconnects to each other, and more importantly connects to a drivetrain that connects to the rear of the chassis. That would at least take an hour of work. 




 A minute

I doubt an engine change would take that fast 




 Bray - Undahteika, Harper - Kane?

New tag team playa! Holla holla 




 While the current dates on his previous contract has been fulfilled, we have no idea if Sting and WWE have an agreement for a future contract. It's all up in the air

That being said I'll mark out if he suddenly appears in LU 




 They told the teams to not used the tyres in weird ways before the Silverstone incident. And yet they were the ones looking bad after that 




 weird. I don't think FFB would have any problems.

My settings are
Deadzone: 0%
FFB Type: Wheel
FFB Strength: Med
FFB Dampening: 0%

all the others are on default

My steering is the Thrustmaster T300RS + Ferrari F1 Rim 




 Yes. That's what I thought as well. Pirelli won't want the Silverstone debacle again, as well as the FIA. Imagine a team using the SS at Sepang, and it hit the cliff in the middle of the lap sending the car careering off. Won't be a good PR 




 Did you change controller type? When you set it at gamepad/joystick, the game change the input based on how long you press/hold.

Changing it to Wheel makes it use analogue input instead 




 They are really sweet tho, even in kayfabe. Thank god they hooked up before the WWE ban on internal relationship took place 




 Why are all the other sponsors are kept, while Marlboro is coughing? 




 Holy shit thanks! 




 The link to download CTDP 05 from their site is dead tho :/

Only the new mods seems to be downloadable

http://www.ctdp.net/

Edit: Oh, it's actually back up. My mistake

Edit edit: Any way I can get their old F1 1998 Mod tho? 




 Yeah. The map will have track numbers on them so that they can easily identify and which corner when communicating with engineers

Some teams have them on the steering like so:

 Assetto Corsa. Actually it looks quite good. but the encoding for the video was bad since I selected frame blending in Premiere and quite a low bitrate 




 It was made by ISI. The base game engine (gMotor) IS a full blown simulator and was used to make: -

- rFactor (gMotor2)

-- rFactor team version, which some teams uses for promo purposes on roadshow. McLaren uses this. Also Formula E road show uses this modded version at all of their races.

-- rFactor Pro, of which some F1 teams like Red Bull and Toro Rosso uses for their simulator. 

-- rFactor 2, an updated version of rFactor with DX11 support

- GTR/GTR 2 (gMotor2)

-- Developer of GTR, Simbin/Slightly Mad Studios went on to make NFS Shift and Shift 2 with only some game engine, with graphic updates. 

- Reiza Studio's Stock Car Extreme, Formula Truck and Copa Petrobras. (gMotor2)

 




 I'm not even mad. I was just curious ^^;

For comparison, here's how a 2014/15 game looks like. 10 years really do make a lot of difference 




 After playing it last night I still love it. I just hate that the 16:9 resolution is limited to 1600x900 only without any option to go to Full HD :/

I miss my old mods tho. The CTDP 2005 Mod was one of the best F1 mod I've ever driven on F1 Challenge. 




 Ah no wonder 




 With the game voiceover telling it's "Magny Cours" I'd never thought anybody would miss that 









 It's just a sarcastic joke :/ 




 Won't be long before we see some of the talents on LU appear in NXT 




 The original is still better 




 Not blackjack mulligan 




 David and Devitt are pronounced the same in Japanese,  (Deibiddo). It makes no sense for him to change anything since it won't do anything. What's most likely was the Prince () was added because Fergal (? ?) is weird in Japanese

Wiki also list his name as "Devitt" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Devitt 




 he was being funny. You need to read the tweet's timeline to get the context 




 It is. The system switched off. 




 1997

Nobody on the grid

10 years later

grid full of media 




 Depends. The token system means that Mercedes still has an advantage, at least until next year. 2017 might be their year tho, and they are looking stronger in each race 




 GTX MLXXX 




 Is Raymond Stereo still in the game or do I need to add him with mods? 




 basically it's like Onions. Onions has layers, PC/computer/console has layers.  




 I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there. 

While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.

Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.

I'll just leave this here 









 "Shh, I know it hurts man" 









 I watched it just recently. I think it was on the Network but for the love of god I forgot what show was it
 




 Both new tyres according to live timing as well on the f1 site. Which means they might be going soft - medium - medium in the race 









 I did. Turns out the network was baby butt smooth using VPN, while my country's cable company decided to show an SD version of WM, and it costs more than the network :/ 




 It's Vine. not twitter video. It's just linked on twitter 









 yeah, just realised that. Try using Hola and use Malaysia as your proxy. It's not blocked here for some reason 









 For Mercedes and Ferrari, use Puma as their kit sponsor 




 I'm waiting for his bad ass biker gimmick 




 Not legal brah 




  : 




 Never knew about this. Thanks!

This is where the Briscoe's ply their trade right? Going to see why WWE wants them so bad

 




 As said, I live in South East Asia. Other than WWE, there are basically no other wrestling program on TV shown. A cable channel did show TNA during the Hogan era, but that does not even last a year.

I am really interested in WWE alternatives, especially LU and was wondering is there a way to view them other than *cough*acquiring it via video sharing*cough*.

Thanks in advance!  




 Miles better than the force scripted ones that he was fed with. But still not on par with some of the best talkers on the current roster. Even Cena is still a better talker than him. 

Given time, he will be as good as Cena. He will never be as good as his cousin tho. 




 tubthimping by John Cena

djingis Khan by Uhaa nation 









 as once said by Jay of OSW, Dunn might hate wrestling, but he gave wwe that much needed production value 




 Because Hunico can speak english, so he and his opponent can communicate better in the ring
 




 Money. Basically now that I am working and earning quite a significant pay I can afford to buy all those Technics that I droll on as a child 




 Sasha Banks is his real FAM brah 




 Sasha Banks is the cousin of Snoop Dog 









 I can't read or see who or what the first superstar says. Weird 




 Anything that Val Venis says 




 Greetings from South East Asia!

And that is USD 41 




 Is there a dickbutt in the UPS logo?

Jokes aside, that is awesome. Even Formula E was kinda closed off and I only managed to sneak in on Friday 




 But.. but... he debuted as the Man's Man

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpPsbkHzrok 




 Guy still looks like he has a few more years in him, and his in ring performance is still good. I hope he can still have his match with ~~Cody~~Stardust down the line on the grandest stage of them all. 




 From comparison, I see that a company would use Drew if they need a simple, robust but good looking/modern belt. If they want an intricate, highly decorative belt that has the retro look, they would use Millican/Parks. 




 Thanks, didn't know that. I took for granted that most belts are made by Millican or Parks

*edit*
God fucking damn it Wildcat. They put "Chris Benoit" on the US Title name plate. I can't stop laughing 




 bad encoding on Fox, combined to their auto bandwith selection for streaming lead to this. Fox also shows F1 in South East Asia, and their 1.2Mbps HD stream on their website looks washed and bad. And even when it's 1.2Mbps, it will auto downgrade to the next lowest, 400Mbps  the moment it detects a bit of lag on your internet. 

I discovered that turning off all things running in background, especially torrent, help in keeping the stream at 1.2Mbps.  




 He is going to TNA. I'm sure 




 He was over when he did that scripted shoot promo. Look it up 




 Because the girl is the awww factor?  




 But I take that WWE designed it, so that it's their own fault that it looks bad?

Also OCC and Millican worked together to make it 

http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/10-greatest-championship-belts 









 nwa has their dome belt. for them the belt has more linage and association with nwa compared to the big gold belt. ironically, wwe also owns the original dome belt 




 did you guys know that most wrestling belts are done by one guy?

http://www.davemillicanbelts.com/

he does belts for WWE, TNA, ROH and others 









 He also said that Hamilton's soft lasted only 11 laps while Vettel lasted 14 and can do more 




 CM Punk is a lead in a harem anime. I actually think it works, and works well 




 I forgot where someone said this, but if you can hear the ring thuds in WWE, it means that the fans are silent and don't care about the match 




 https://youtu.be/5PwWjRR6uxo

checo was Banzai'ing, but only one clean overtake happened 




 im guessing he has low rear grip due to old tyres. GP2 has limited sets per weekend, and some drivers may use them all up in race one leaving them with worn tyres for race 2 




 someone send OSW lots of beer and tatoo their name and ask them to do it 




 Remember the Shockmaster? 









 awesome and good wallpaper material as well. did you render the on track pics? because those those looks damn realistic.

the design is brilliant, even tho most wont adhere to FIA rule and / or make no sense (single pillar for the front wing?) but concept car never meant to make sense.

you should tweet or email this to the Red Bull PR 




 I bought this set, altho the Ferrari was a tad too expensive 

That being said, I bought the Lego 42000 and 42039 Technic set as well 




 Neville's ear is what makes gravity forgets him 




 Reigns vs Big Show

Triple Threat feat. Reigns and Ryback

Nope, I just went to sleep rather than waste any energy 




 Super Dragon 




 Lines: the thing that Lilian Garcia forgot 




 Yep. But some of the early WWF/WWE matches were still using aluminium ladders, which flexes dangerously. Hence why they changed it to wood 




 Mike Awesome's Awesome Bomb (Running Razor's Edge). God it look so dangerous, especially since WCW has a small ring, and the guy on the end of the move usually would nearly get their head hit the turnbuckle 




 Since Renault is a French team, would the higher management be happy for them to be based in Faenza? 

If they do move, (to England's motorsport valley I presume) this would also mean the end of an era to the original Minardi team 




 I love their accent. "T-Shart" was a hilarious botch 




 Saying about Cole, not Lilian tho 




 Cole added it a bit later 
"Remember folks, this is a no disqualification match". 

Either I did not hear it the first time, or the dub it in the Network replay of WM 




 Damien Sandow winning a world title 




 I misread the OP's title as "Indian Movie" and was hyped to see JR in Bollywood :/ 




 i think he's a part timer who helps talen in nxt to learn, and not really having a real run 




 Depends on Trips honestly. Joe does not really need to prove anything, but WWE loves their superstars to toe the line, hence going to NXT to clean some rough edges so to speak 




 Remember  Rufus "Pancake" Patterson? I wish they would let him use that character more
