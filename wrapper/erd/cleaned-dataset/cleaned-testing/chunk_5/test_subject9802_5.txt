 Scientists actually sent tardigrades into space with the mission name "Tardigrades In space" shortened to TARDIS 




 I can relate to this. Hugs, OP. Sorry you're struggling :( 




 Hey, I'm a lady and I still think this is a fucking badass apartment. I'd live there happily! 




 Xioacan old fashioned.  

2oz Mezcal  
Muddled sugar cube and luxardo cherry  
2-4 dash hellfire bitters  
Add ice, top with ginger beer 




 Whoa, this is an old post, haha. Thanks, I guess? 




 this is awesome, thanks! 




 I know, but I can dream!!! 




 The first thing I thought of was how fucking cool it would be to have eyes that see colors/uv/infrared like the mantis shrimp can. THE THINGS WE COULD SEE! 




 Why would you post a video of yourself throwing a giant tantrum? 




 clearly! 




 Gotta keep fighting the good fight! **hugs** 




 One of my best friends almost died from lupus. Her story is so sad. She is better now, but she has to be really careful lest flare-ups happen. She broke out in terrible hives when we were in Spain together and her throat almost closed up. It was really scary being in a country where none of us knew much of the language during a situation such as that.

"I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to  
The old world to drink and decline  
And to pretend that the search for another new world  
Was well-worth the burning of mine"   




 I... have a weird opinion of feel good music, haha. 




 The one that drunkenly hits on me and when I say I'm not interested calls me a lesbian.

 This. Just don't shove faith down my throat and we're cool. I won't shove my lack thereof in yours. 




 The thesaurus is a great source! Any smartphone has a thesaurus in conjunction with the dictionary app. Type in a word, find something similar.  

My favorite word is "absolutely". It may seem silly and common, but the use of absolutely in place of "sure" or "no problem" comes of so much more eloquent. 




 Depression/suicide awareness. I feel like so many people are depressed but so few people have the tact or understanding to be a supportive friend to someone struggling with depression. So many people give advice but usually all someone wants is to *not* talk or think about their issues. That's what a therapist is for. We just want to be distracted as a way to be cheered up.  

Also, eating disorders. There isn't a whole lot of understanding with the kind of addiction and struggle that ED sufferers endure. A lot of people think it's about vanity when it very rarely is, or, if it started out that way, it never is the reason for persisting.  




 God I love Josh Ritter. Another new world is absolutely gorgeous. Also, The Temptation of Adam... 




 Saloon! 




 Boston shaker is the best! I live and work at a bar right by there :) 




 I got my septum done at chameleon in Harvard sq in the garage. Very clean and professional. This was in '09 and I still have it; no complications, and painless. 




 Whoa, really?! I always thought it was a healthy alternative to *eating food*. 




 Smoking. 




 Dark, malty beer and almond butter... mmmgod yes. 




 There's a restaurant in Canada called "Signs" that is an all deaf staff where sign language is mandatory for ordering. You could probably work there even if you weren't deaf, I'm sure... 




 Even better: "What do they mean?!" 




 Hahaha, true story. I worked as a travel assistant in a call center that sold tour packages to American seniors. I chatted for a good hour with this guy's father! Dude was hilarious and so proud of his kids! 




 Honestly wasn't expecting the comment to get noticed, let alone be so popular, haha. 




 Ugh, thank you for referencing Big Mama! I feel like nobody knows her and it's tragic because she's *fucking awesome*! 




 Right there with you. It's a blessing and a curse, damn it! 




 Yeah, if it becomes a massive string it can be a little cumbersome. 




 Night mode is pretty rad. I should probably do that for my eyeballs sake. 




 So many different platforms I'm learning about! 




 Well it's not *too far* from the truth.  




 Ha, well based on everyone elses response, it seems like I'm not the only one. But, you know, it's cool if you feel that way. 




 I had people trying to get me on reddit for about three years. Now I have no life. 




 I'll agree with you there. I've gotten to liking the layout in a lot more ways than I initially thought, but there are still flaws that sometimes keep me from commenting/participating. 




 I refuse to download any platforms for reddit. I already waste too much time here 




 That sounds awful! 




 Yeah, it takes time. Now that I'm used to it, I actually quite like the layout. 




 Yeah, I feel you there... I spend WAY too much of my time on here. 




 I was coaxed into trying SomethingAwful and used to browse it regularly. It got kind of boring and I ditched any type of forums for a while. Eventually, friends of mine kept forwarding funny/interesting threads and I decided I'd give it a fair shot. Still hooked. 




 Touch 




 Hahaha, at least you kept trying! Dr. Pepper is huge in Texas. 




 That's fair. I can agree with that. 




 Haha, yeah but for some reason men think the same thing. When I specifically try to give off the "just being friendly, not interested in dating, but you're cool, bro." vibe, a lot of men take it as playing hard to get.  




 Yeah, gay men seem to have no problem flirting with women and women definitely tend to be okay with it. I think it's just "fun" for the guys and "safe" for the women. 




 They'd be more likely to have an orgy if they're **all** gay, don't you think? I guess I would consider myself straight because I pretty much only date men, but I enjoy sleeping with women. I prefer not to consider myself any particular sexuality because it's not really that black and white, though. Pansexual? haha... 




 Ah, I used to work in a cubicle. That shit would *not fly* there! 




 Thanks for pointing that out! Derp. I work at a bar. There's really no such thing as harassment in bars. I mean, obviously *there is*, but we're all pretty open with being weird and inappropriate. It's best to just roll with it rather than get all uptight. 




 Eh, I don't think so. We're just very open about our sexuality/sex lives at work. Restaurants and bars are pretty inappropriate by normal job standards. 




 Nope. I have long hair! It was a lady coworker that said that one to me, haha. 




 I would love it if that song played in the background every time I had to tell a drunk idiot to please get the hell out of my way while I'm carrying 5 manhattans.
