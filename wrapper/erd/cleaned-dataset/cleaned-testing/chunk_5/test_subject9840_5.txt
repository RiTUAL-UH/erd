 When I read meter I think of a parking meter.  




 Aw didn't see that!  




 The article from which I stole the title: http://www.msn.com/en-au/news/world/nilo-the-donkeys-petting-zoo-escape-foiled-by-unexpected-manhole/ar-BBdb4zH?ocid=iehp 

I used the other one because it has more details.

Also the donkey is fine!! 









 Beggars can't be choosers.. someone's giving you something for free. Suck it up if you occasionally get something you don't want. 




 My husband started going for evening walks with me. He is a good listener so just listens to me while we walk. The fresh air does me good and although I don't feel 100% it just calms me a little. It kinda makes each day just a little bit more bearable.  




 Yeah I know, just wanted to try it out to see how it was. 




 Whenever I lift up things in the garden it's always redbacks. 




 I used myGov for the first time this year. It's faster to fill out but having done my tax with e-tax for as long as I can remember it feels like I'm missing out on possible tax deductions... 

I also really missed all the useful help buttons and the depreciation calculator.  




 Thanks for sharing this. I hadn't read it before. My family has been unlucky and had lots of cancer deaths in the last 2 generations from bowel, cervical, lung and leukaemia. One aunt on each side has had breast cancer and both survived when none of the others have, so I do wish there was more funding for some of the other areas. 




 Thundamentals rocked it. They did do their brother cover! They also got a verse in Cosby Sweater along with K21 who has an amazing stage presence. Apparently the first time they've done that together on this tour. I filmed it from my phone tho its not as good as being there obviously - http://youtu.be/I-AjnIapqCY 




 I was actually at the hospital earlier this week getting a scan and the nurse was injecting a cannula into my vein to deliver the contrasting agent. 

As I'm clenching my fist waiting for a needle she turns back to me and looks at my arm and says very thoughtfully "Ahhh it's good to be young and have nice healthy veins..." and then jabs me with the needle.

My response was "uhh yeah, I guess so... I've never considered that before..."  




 I saw Hilltop Hoods last night along with K21 and Thundamentals! It was awesome. I've never been to a hip hop gig before. Love Australian music.  




 Where most of the west has been bended.

Do you think, do you think we'll mend it?

No I guess it's only Perth we'll just defend it.


(Just kidding. Perth rocks.)
 




 I didn't know this before but oreodory fish are a bad choice of fish to eat. They are not managed well from a fisheries point of view. 

http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/what-we-do/publications/the-best-fish-guide-/fish-species-/oreos/deepwater-dory

Oh and E is bad.

"Description:Oreos are deepwater fish that are long-lived (up to 150 years) and slow growing, making them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure and overfishing. There are three commercial species in New Zealand, but they are all managed as one quota management species. They are predominantly found in deep waters off the east and south of the South Island and off the Chatham Islands. Jointly with snapper, mako shark and southern bluefin tuna, oreos have the second worst ecological ranking on the Best Fish Guide of any commercial fishery in New Zealand.

Ecological concerns:Management of the three oreo species as one, a declining stock trend, uncertainty over stock boundaries, lack of stock assessments in some areas, unknown sustainability of catch limits and lack of a management plan. Attempts to improve research in the oreo fishery have been hampered by the seafood industry challenging and preventing the Ministry of Fisheries from commissioning research surveys. 

Also of great concern is the destructive impact of deep sea trawling on seamount habitats and high levels of non target fish bycatch. There is also a bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds. 

Economic value:Key markets are the USA, Australia, Germany and Switzerland, with smooth oreo being the main market species. Exports were worth $7.47 million in 2008.

 There was a well written back story on ebola including the efforts from Samaritans Purse in our paper today: http://m.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-world-let-ebola-spread-20141007-10rh8r.touch.touch.html 




 To the people going to West Africa to help. Thank you. The truth is that so many of us are cowards - too scared for our own lives to risk them in helping others. You are the best and bravest of us. You are probably scared just like the rest of us, worrying about the moment you might make a small mistake that would be the difference between life and death, but you go anyway. You go because you believe that without you, someone might suffer and die alone. Without you, there might be no one else to care for someone who else who was unlucky enough to catch the disease. While the media continues to discuss avoidance, you know they are a person just like us - a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a daughter or son. Instead of running away you run to those who need you most in the world. You are someone's true hero.  




 Great photos. 

One question though - how come two people didn't lift the mattress to wherever they are taking it rather than dragging it across the ground? Wouldn't that [spread any bodily fluids on the mattress](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/)?  




 I believe UNICEF are doing a range of things which include education within communities, supply of hygene products, medical supplies, medical training, protective equipment, vehicles and assisting with burial. They are also helping kids who've lost both parents to ebola and have been abandoned by their extended families to be cared for. They are training medical and support staff. 

They are a large organisation with more resources than some of the others so may not get as much specific attention, but they are doing their bit. For the record I have no preference for a particular organisation - they all need our support. I'm just hoping to provide more information here.


Some examples from http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/world-bank-group-ebola-fact-sheet :

* World Bank Group funds have already financed a first shipment of 100 tons of essential health and hygiene supplies (worth $1.6 million), which were procured and delivered by UNICEF to Liberia on Aug. 26. Among the items in the shipment were hundreds of sets of personal protective equipment, latex gloves, thermometers, syringes, and other medical supplies to restock depleted stores at many of the countrys health facilities.

* On Sept. 5, UNICEF procured and delivered 48 tons of materials and essential drugs for Ebola treatment centers (antibiotics and other essential medicines, cannula, coveralls to protect health workers, 7,440 pairs of latex gloves, and body bags) to Sierra Leone (worth $850,000), also financed by the World Bank Group. On Sept. 17, also with World Bank Group financing, UNICEF airlifted a second delivery to Sierra Leone (worth $1.7 million), of 100 tons of drugs and equipment, including personal protective equipment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and chlorine.

* On Sept. 9, UNICEF procured and delivered 28 new, all-terrain vehicles to the Guinea Ministry of Health (worth $880,000). These vehicles will provide much-needed ground logistics support to treatment, supervision, contact monitoring, and burial teams working in Guinea. A second lot of vehicles will include ambulances for patient transfers and motorbikes for contact monitoring in remote, hard-to-reach villages.  

More examples from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_75900.html :

Examples of such effort by UNICEF and its partners include:

* With support from the World Bank, Japan and USAID, airlifting 544 metric tonnes of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with almost 50 flights since early August. These supplies include protective equipment, hygiene items and essential medicines.

* Supporting the Government of Sierra Leone in conducting a three-day public awareness campaign, 19-21 September, by helping train volunteers and providing accurate information on Ebola.

* Installing water and sanitation facilities in Ebola treatment units in the three countries.

* Training community health volunteers, teachers and others and help spread life-saving information on Ebola.

* Working to avert non-Ebola disease outbreaks and provide basic services to women and children.

* Providing psychosocial support to children affected by Ebola.

Another example from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_76239.html : 

* 10 October 2014  A cargo plane with nearly 100 metric tons of essential medical supplies left Amsterdam today en route to Sierra Leone as part of UNICEFs continuing response to the Ebola outbreak ravaging parts of West Africa. Similar flights are planned for Liberia and Guinea, part of a 1 million donation from the European Commissions Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO). Todays shipment includes protective equipment such as masks, gloves, aprons, coveralls, body bags, goggles, face shields as well as medicine and hygiene supplies to be distributed to households and health centers. This supply has been funded by donors, such as the World Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). 
To date, UNICEF has flown in more than 912 metric tons of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in what is now the largest airlift operation of Ebola supplies.

You could also look into Red Cross who are front line too:
http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Red-Cross-Opens-New-Clinic-to-Fight-Ebola-in-Sierra-Leone
I'm not sure where to go to donate to Ebola from the US site, but the Australian site has a direct donation page to the Ebola outbreak appeal:
http://www.redcross.org.au/ebola-outbreak-2014-appeal.aspx


And another is Samaritans Purse whose staff were among the first to contract Ebola, so they are front line too:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/
You can read more about their work here:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/hope-takes-flight-across-the-atlantic/
I volunteer for them every now and then when I have time. 

 




 I didn't see this but I gave money to Unicef earlier. They're a large organisation and I think they have more resources. They put a similar perceantage of your donation into field work (Not sure what it is where you are but in Australia it's 78% of the money you donate goes to field work, while doctors without borders puts about 4% more ie. 82% of the money to field work).

 Nice one. A smile is something most of us take for granted. You look so much happier now :D  




 Lol yeah. The piece of prawn was the same size as him!

 If you frame the ratings in the context of a terrorist warning system it kind of makes sense. http://www.fire.tas.gov.au/Show?pageId=colFireDangerRatings

Catastrophic = leave early

Extreme = leave early

Severe = prepare to leave early

Very high = prepare to leave

High = prepare 

Low-Medium = continue as usual
 




 If I had a piece of rubbish after leaving the office I would have to wait until I got home around 1.5 hours later to dispose of it. No bins at my city stop, 1 hour train ride, no bins at destination stop, 10 min wait for the bus, 15 min ride home, 5 min walk from bus stop. Yeah, so I'm going to leave it at the station. Because at least cleaners will usually come along and pick it up there as opposed to throwing it on the street. I suppose that makes me irresponsible but it's the truth and why my station was always littered with people's rubbish.  




 It doesn't mean people hate you though. It's hard to find people that you can connect with. It also takes a lot of time and effort to build up friendships. 

Aside from friends, do you think you could change anything to make things better for yourself?  




 You would love the big pineapple! http://lettiemusic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-big-pineapple-near-nambour-queensland.jpg 




 Yeah true, but I was really referring to this particular incident, where they were driving dangerously and probably didn't mean to harm the person in the car but did as a result of their dangerous driving.  




 Well I think you only get charged with manslaughter if you actually kill someone accidentally. Otherwise you get charged with endangering someone's life.  




 If you are in Australia there is an organisation called "R U OK?". It's been around for a few years. 

They did some advertising a couple of years ago but I haven't heard anything in a while. They were trying to have a regular "R U OK? Day". 

I think it's a great idea to remind people to be there for each other.

Is there anything like that in the US and UK? 


Our next R U OK day is 11 Sept, but it's just a yearly awareness reminder to look out for other people and we should be doing that all the time. 




 I don't know if it is true for you but for me sometimes it is just my thought process and how I view the world. What someone might see in one way I see in a completely different way. 

I was told to try to capture when I am sad, unhappy, angry and so on, and try to identify the triggers. In doing that I can understand what my thought process is and potentially redirect it more positively. I am still struggling with this and need help to see the flaws in my thought process. Most of the time I am really hard on myself. I guess this is going to take time. 




 No problems at all. I hope that if I can pass on some things that have taken me years to learn about myself, maybe it will give you a different perspective and/or make it easier for you to learn about yourself. 

It took a while for me to get out of the mindset of being isolated. I am not saying to follow my path but explaining where I came from and how things changed. If I could have changed things earlier I would have had a better life sooner. 

I've always been a bit different to other people and when I was in high school and university that was really to my detriment. I was very lonely for a very long time and also very depressed. But the hurt that I suffered made me strive for a better life so that I could be independent financially and have more control over my own life. That was my #1 priority. I struggled and worked really hard to do that. I wasn't successful at first, in fact, the opposite, so I worked even harder. Years later, I got there and got the independence I wanted. You'd think by then, being successful, I would be happy right? But by this point I'd gotten into a habit of striving for perfection, and I was not at all happy with myself. I was always thinking I wasn't good enough and putting myself down in my head. Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself. And that is when I let other people in, once I could be okay with myself and not always judge myself in a negative way. It was hard at first and people did let me down occasionally but I suppose in the end I learnt my own self-worth and it made me more resilient. I am still closed off a little bit and don't let people in so easily and freely as other people but I feel comfortable at this level of disclosure. :)

What I hope you can take away from all of my lessons is that you are a worthy person. People always say "nobody's perfect" but it's become a cliche and it's almost a throwaway comment as it doesn't really matter about everyone else, 'cause we're talking about you. You're not perfect, and that's completely okay. You are a valuable person who matters. You can live your life in a way that means something to you. You do need to be careful with your trust but not completely abandon giving trust to people. How do you know who you can trust? You said you had a friend who asked about you? Well think about what's in it for him? It seems to me like probably not much, except that he cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay. If you ask yourself what's in it for the other person it can ease your mind a little bit that they don't have an ulterior motive. If you're not sure, then proceed with caution, until you have time to learn more about them. 

I know that was long winded but I hope it helps. 
 




 It could be. When people hurt you it's hard to trust anyone. Opening up is about trust because you're letting someone get to know you and you always feel there is a chance they won't like you and the rejection can hurt. Really though I think it takes a lot for someone to honestly dislike someone. The people who did that to you are mean but they're not the majority of people. I think there are more people like that in school and I'm not sure if they even really know how much they hurt others.

I think the point I'm trying to get to is trust comes in degrees. There are some people who you should be able to trust enough to talk to. From what you said it sounds like you already know who that is. Some people you need to be more wary of. I think it's important to differentiate between those people. It's hard to trust people but it's also hard to live life alone.
 
I was also hurt but in a different way and I think all the same things as you sometimes. I have changed though from isolating myself and can open up more now but I am much more selective who I trust these days. I like having people to share my life with but it's all about having the right people. I'm not compatible with everyone.  




 Sounds like a lot of stuff has been happening. Maybe it's the uncertainty and changes that are causing you to feel unsettled? 

Being around other people is different to feeling like you have companions. Sometimes I have walked through the city and seen hundreds of people but felt completely and utterly alone. I start to think it's sad and then I realise that I don't want to know them all because I like my anonymity. But then I'm alone and I want someone to be with me but not just anyone...

Whoever this person is online they don't sound good for you. Sometimes people who want something from you are the easiest to talk to but not the best. I don't know how, but try to find someone else to talk to. There are people around who will listen and not try to manipulate you while doing so.    




 What happened? :( 




 In terms of what impression you give you can't really know without asking. Even then it's a bit murky. I think you just have to reflect yourself. Think of ways other people act that you like e.g. giving compliments (if you like that) and try to do the same, and of ways people act that you don't like e.g. being too direct (again, if you don't like that) and try to avoid that. It's not really black and white - for example, most of the time I like people being fairly straightforward but the timing is important. Giving me very direct critical feedback when I'm under a lot of pressure and asking for help is possibly not the best idea. 

If you think people are intimidated to talk to you maybe it is just your manner. Do you think perhaps you could be coming across as arrogant? Or maybe just not open to continuing conversation. It's pretty hard to talk to someone who doesn't add details to the conversation or respond with questions. One thing some people do is talk about themselves but forget to talk to others or take any interest in the other person's responses. 

I'm not sure why you think you might come across as a jerk? Did someone say something to you?

Maybe you're just going through an introverted cycle. I go from being extroverted and really gaining energy from social interactions to an introvert who really loses energy from being around other people. It goes in cycles and really depends what else is going on in my life. Could this be the case with you? 




 It's good you got to talk to her. 

Maybe you need to process the depressive thoughts you have before they pop up out of the blue. I know for me if I ignore them then I actually start getting really vivid and horrible nightmares. Some have been so bad I have woken up crying or throwing up. So I have to write stuff out and try to process it while I am conscious or else the emotions come out when I don't want them to. The weird thing is sometimes I don't even feel like anything is wrong while I'm awake but I'm sure I'm stressed or anxious and I'm just suppressing it.

I mean you might have a different result than me, but maybe it could help? 




 Yeah :( I have heard other people on here mention community or church groups if you need someone to lend an ear? Sometimes it just helps for someone to listen to you so you can talk about it and process all the thoughts and feelings you are going through.  




 That sounds exhausting for him.  

If the pain is temporary I suppose just remind him that it'll be over soon. It's not a way to live but I really hope the specialists and doctors he is seeing can provide a way forward for him that isn't so debilitating. 

I don't really know what else you can say or do, except to be there. I think it means a lot to have someone there supporting him so he doesn't feel alone. 
 




 You can talk to me? 

Can you apologise to her for saying whatever you said? It sounds to me like you're genuinely sorry about it.

Was there some event that made you feel depressed or was it just sort of out of the blue? For me it's usually both :( 




 You've been through a lot and suffered a lot of hurt so I'm not surprised you are feeling low. From what you have said it sounded like you were in a toxic relationship and it's good that you have walked away from that. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. 

And also, there is no way you deserved to be raped. It's crazy that people would say that to you! They're outright wrong. 

You need to give yourself some time to process everything you've just been through. I hope you realise that however bad you feel, you deserve to live a life where you don't have to feel alone and where each day doesn't feel like a struggle. You said you moved in with your mom, can you stay there a while until you feel more stable and can start to pick the pieces up again? 




 It is terribly sad when someone dies, and knowing that the world will continue without them feels like a horrifying prospect. Some people I have lost I wonder why the world didn't just end right then, and just not bother to continue existing. 

But then I remember other people in my life, and although I am terribly stricken and sad that I have lost someone who is so important to me, I remember the other people I love and who have shown love for me and I hold onto that, and I try to be a kinder and better person for them.  




 Sites like  www.freelancer.com or www.elance.com. I think there are a few others but I can't remember their names.

There's also other things like www.airtasker.com or www.taskrabbit.com where you can do little jobs for people. 
 




 What about looking at some of the jobs on some of the online freelancing websites? They don't pay very much but then it's something you can add to your resume and it might help to show you have some initiative?  




 Wow that sucks. They sound completely unprofessional. :( 

I had a really bad one when I was younger, who gave me horrible advice. It's good you recognised this early and can walk away. 

Is there anywhere else you can go instead? Like not a different doctor, but a different facility altogether?  




 Nope. It sounds like you have been busy with other things so I don't see why that would be a problem. My first job was when I was 21 and it was at Kmart.  




 One thing that has taken me ages to accept is that it's okay to not be perfect, or even far from it. Before I was always frustrated with myself and I always felt like I would never be good enough. I don't know why, but knowing that gives me a level of confidence. 

When people reject me in interviews, I try not to take it personally, although it always is a bit. But what I try to do is to see an interview as a performance, and if I do that then it's something that I can work on, rather than it being a rejection of me as a person. If I can't find a good reason for the rejection then I blame them and convince myself that they're a company I don't want to work for anyway. :D
 




 Yeah I wish people would do that more often too. Do you have any friends or family that might know of jobs? The job I have now is because a friend recommended me.  




 The first full-time job I got took ages to get. I had an undergraduate degree but didn't have good grades. I started applying for receptionist roles because there weren't any positions in my field. When I started getting rejected from those it was really hard to take. I felt like I'd wasted years of my life and achieved nothing. But I kept trying anyway even though it felt hopeless and eventually someone gave me a chance. I think it took 6 months to get that first job. I think the first job is always the hardest because not many people are willing to take a chance. I'm so grateful to the person that gave me my first full-time job. It's not just you, it's a difficult first step. 

Oh and tips for getting a job - mainly just keep trying. Also I don't know if you have already but try to get a character reference to support your application - seeing as you have no prior non-military experience that will help. Maybe after you've been turned down by someone, try asking for feedback. Not many people are willing to give it but if they do it may help you. I don't think not having used a cash register is a good reason - maybe there was some other reason? I'm not saying to probe for it but if you reflect on the interview do you think it could it have been something else? 




 What about reading a book? Or listening to music? Or going for a jog? Watching a movie? Playing video games? Drawing? I'm not sure. Just something, anything really, to get your mind off it. Is there anything you used to enjoy doing? Maybe you could take a course or something and learn something new, and meet new people?

I guess none of us ever really learn with love. I think we all want to have someone in our lives and we can't help but keep taking those risks and even though we know it might hurt like hell, we hope that it works out - sometimes it doesn't, but then maybe you only need it to work out once.  




 I had the same thing the other day. I wanted to call but I didn't want to block up the line from people who really needed it. 

I think you just need a friend to talk to. It sounds like you have the tools to do it but need someone to lend their ear so you can reason it all out. 

If you want to chat I'm all ears. 




 It's hard looking at other people's lives and comparing yours. The thing is nobody will ever have a life just like someone else's. How do you know if someone else is going to be happy? Why aren't all those people with lots of money and a loving family happy? What about those people that seem to have it all? A lot of stuff happens that other people don't always see. 

In terms of catching up, I honestly think people are busy/lazy/preoccupied, and until they have really gotten to know you, they mightn't go out of their way to catch up. Even friends that do know each other don't catch up as they should sometimes. I know I do it sometimes, and it doesn't mean I don't care, just that I'm not perfect and I kinda suck at doing things in a timely way. It might be up to you a bit. 

One of the hardest thing for me was moving jobs and realising when I moved that all those people I thought were my friends seemed to have no interest in keeping in contact with me once I left, which felt really weird seeing as I'd seen them every day for 3 years. I even spent lunch hours talking to one girl about all her problems. The first 6-12 months after I left and joined the new company I was so lonely. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I didn't know why people didn't try to contact me, even an email, anything. I'd joined a consulting company and everyone was out on clients and too busy to talk to me, so I was basically by myself. I am on projects by myself often and I often eat alone. After a year I finally made a couple of friends though, we still aren't that close, but that's ok. I think that is going to take a long time. 

But I did contact my old work friends, and not all of them, but some of them made the time to see me. It just took me to take the initiative. After doing that a couple of times now they do ask me out sometimes. 

Would you consider trying to see the other friends again?  




 :( That is really tough. You took a risk with your heart and it hurts. If I could hug you through the internet I would. 

I suppose the best advice I can give you is to try to do things to keep your mind off of it. Sure you're going to think about it sometimes but if you're busy then hopefully not as much.  




 I think most people want to be in a relationship and be close to someone, and of course rejection hurts. If you feel hurt by that then feeling dislike towards someone else is entirely natural. 

It can be hard to find someone who is compatible with you in life. From looking at friends I have, it seems to be entirely random. It's not that one person is better than the other, it's just that things happened in their life that led them to meet this other person who also felt the same way. 

I don't think there is a secret formula to finding that person. I know a lot of people who are older and single and entirely unhappy about it, and also entirely undeserving - they're nice people - and it's not like they wanted that, just how their life turned out. What I'm trying to say I suppose is that to some extent it is out of your control, and I know this is hard to take, but you might have to figure out how to be happy with yourself and on your own before you find that other person that can make you feel complete.  




 Hey I think amp3rsand gave some good advice. 

It's going to take time to get through the grief and you don't want to have extra stress hanging over you. What's a "good" job worth if it's not good for you. 

I also think travelling could be a great idea once you have sorted out the legal stuff. Travelling made me feel free, when before that I had felt so trapped. If that's what you want to do, go for it.  




 Sorry, I should have read that from what you said. 

Well, for me, I just tried lots of different things. Some I liked, some I didn't like. I think pick one thing that is with other people, and one thing you do alone to begin with. Sometimes I like being around other people, and sometimes I really just want to be alone, so it's good having different types of things to choose from.

Some things I have done on my own are:
* I wanted to learn how to crochet, so I just bought myself a crochet needle and some wool and learnt from youtube.
* I wanted to learn how to make my hair less boring, so I got a straightening iron and learnt how to curl it on youtube. 
* I wanted to learn how to write a phone app, so I tried that out, and that's fun. It's good to see something on your phone when you get to that point. It's also something that's a bit more involved so keeps me entertained for longer and stops me from thinking too much. 
* I also really like writing, so sometimes I write stories, fiction and non-fiction. I also like writing blogs about stuff I know about and people are actually pretty grateful when you help them out with stuff. Some of my most successful blog posts have been about really simple things.

Some things I do with others are:
* I started volunteering with a friend. I don't like sitting around in cafes that much so it's good to keep yourself busy while being able to talk to your friend/s.
* I play field hockey, and it's good but it's only half a year. Still, I enjoy it. I'm no olympian, it's purely social but it's great like that. 
* Next week I'm going rock climbing with a friend. I haven't been for a very long time but I figured why not try it. I don't really think I'll like it but I'm going to go anyway and see. Sometimes I change my mind.

I guess when you find the thing you like you can invest more energy in it. I think that sort of happens naturally. And then because you invest energy in it you get better at it and it becomes your thing. 




 Hey, I'm glad you shared your story.  I read the whole thing and really feel for you.

Why did you and your girlfriend split up? 

Is there anyone else you would consider to be close in your life right now? 




 There's nothing wrong with feeling better and telling other people about it. :)  




 Beautiful. Reminds me of the waterfalls at Treble Cone a bit, but more magnificent. :)  




 Is there anything you enjoy doing right now? 




 I don't think happy is the right word, but yeah, better for having talked about things.  




 Have you tried the Google Translate app? Apparently you can take a photograph and it will translate the text in the photograph for you. I haven't really tried it but you sound like a good tester! :) There is another one called Photo Translate. 

It sucks that the expat community wasn't nice to you. I heard sometimes it's better to help you integrate into a community to try to make friends with locals anyway. Is there any chance of that? Are there any korean people you could hang with? 




 For some people, depression comes and goes, and for others it is a lifelong battle. The latter is true for me. It never really went away, and it took me so long to realise that it might not. When I realised that after about 15 years I was horrified at first. But resigning to that fact meant that I had to deal with it, as much as I didn't want to. Having depression doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't moments and things that are worth living for, even if the world is dark and you can't see that right now. I hope you do get to see that. 

One other thing I want to say is that while drugs and therapists are there to help, I do sometimes think that ultimately it is down to you to figure out what it is that helps you get by and what it is that makes life bearable for you. It might not be a short battle but it sounds like you have caring family and friends and resources available to help you in whatever way they can. I know you resent that you can't make that choice, and I did too, but those people care about you and they're just trying to help.  




 Glad I could be there to listen. 




 Oh I can see a tinge of blue in the light. That's going to look great. :) 




 Good luck. I hope it goes well.  




 Yay. What color did you make it? I always wanted blue streaks.  




 I'd give you money for lunch. I would never be too tired to make sure a friend could eat. :( 




 First, congratulations on finishing one of your goals. You don't have to feel overwhelming joy about it. You can recognise it for what it is though - an achievement. You've done well. 

Happiness is separate I think. It isn't about summing up success and subtracting the failures. I remember finishing something that was important to me and not really being that happy about it just feeling like.. ok great... what now? And then feeling a bit lost cause I had no idea, I'd never thought that far ahead before. I only had a plan up until that moment. You know what that means though? Now you can try doing other things and see what excites you. And it doesn't have to be achievements or stuff other people value, just stuff that you value.  




 Can you do your own cooking? Sometimes it's hard to find exactly what you want if you're eating out often.  




 Maybe you can find a hobby that lets you meet other singles like yourself. And I don't mean necessarily for the purposes of finding a girlfriend. I mean people who enjoy being single who you can hang with.  




 How about some adjective that doesn't describe that it was good/bad. That's what I generally do with questions related to asking how my day was. Like saying it was busy or quiet. This doesn't work that well if people want to ask more questions about it. Generally just saying "good" is the easiest way to have no follow up questions.  




 By the way, sorry about the slow replies. My reddit connection kept dropping in and out for some reason. :( 




 Yeah I agree that person is a dick. 

You don't need to be entitled or have specific problems to be depressed, you can just feel crappy. Also, who says your problems don't matter? Let it out if you want to... 




 I think you do need to talk about it not just bottle it up. 

Sometimes it is hard talking to friends though because then you are letting them into a very personal part of who you are and it takes a lot of trust in another person to do that.  But I also think that's what friends are for. Maybe you just need to find that person who is non-judgmental and who you can trust.

Another option is maybe talking to a psychologist or counselor? Then it's private between you and them. 




 It does sound like you are doing the best you can. And you're helping. You have taken on a lot of responsibility in taking care of your two little sisters. It does sound like he doesn't appreciate it but that's not to say it shouldn't be appreciated. 

I can't say why he is yelling at you but it sounds like it might be more to do with him than it is to do with you. 

It's hard to not care when you're faced directly with the situation. You sound like you just want it to be better and it isn't happening. 

Is this a once off thing or has this been going on for a while? Could you talk to your mum about his behavior and how it is making you feel? 




 I don't think you're just being emotional and overdramatic. Your feelings are real. 

What makes you feel like you're a failure? Is part of that because you feel like your parents don't value what you have to say?  




 You can talk to me. What's on your mind?  




 I used to sleep in my car sometimes. The worst thing was the seat belt plugs. This is a great idea.  




 I switched to Pepsi Max and it made me pee urgently so now I'm back to coke zero or diet coke with no caffeine. I should really stop :( 




 I did this for a short time and the doc said that binge eating like that can be a thyroid condition. If you are doing this a lot you should check out if you have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A blood test can tell you. 




 I ate maccas everyday for 6 months cause I was working full time and studying and didn't have time for a lunch break. It was so convenient to drive through and eat at traffic lights. I got pretty sick :(

Recently I hadn't had maccas in months and then I got it the other day and sat next to a really stinky homeless guy. Now I associate maccas with smelly people and I don't crave it. KFC is so much better :) Luckily it's not convenient for me. 




 Drinking coke zero. I know it's stupid and it should be easy to stop but it's everywhere. It started out as a way to have a break from the office for 5-10 mins and now it is a fully ingrained habit. It's not even supposed to be addictive. It's just delicious.  




 I did this. It's so painful. You gotta just keep trying to let go. Think of the months or years you are wasting on someone who is not reciprocating. If you keep enjoying life and doing the things you want to do you will hopefully meet someone more worthy.  




 There are some guys who hand out leftover bread at Central Station near the tram stop around 7pm. Does anyone know what charity these guys are? 




 
Edit: Didn't read that properly 




 What? 60km? As long as you're in Australia I'll post you them if you want them that badly lol. 

I also want them that badly but it is more like 1km away for me. :) 




 On second read they only store partial credit card details. Some companies do this for fraud detection.  E.g. last 4 digits and expiry which is enough to identify you but not to use your card. 




 I think they are allowed to store your credit card details if they are PCI compliant: http://www.cio.com.au/article/400300/what_pci_compliance_/

Although my understanding is that they can't store your CVV.

They probably just did it for your convenience, but maybe that was a bad decision. 

I think the biggest problem is that this is so long ago... and they didn't tell anyone :/ 




 Ah thanks for that. I remember now. I think your advice is pretty good. I am 31 and time does fly when you're older but it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think the main thing is being busy due to spending a lot of time in full time work. My advice would be to always make time for yourself and for the things that are important to you, and especially to organize some down time for yourself. Always being busy makes it feel like it's going quickly... but it doesn't have to be that way. When you're younger you can try lots of things and have lots of time for random stuff. When you're working full time you need to be a bit more selective. One thing that changes is when you have a job you have more freedom over what you do with your time and the money you earn. I try to live a life of experiences.  




 The original post was deleted and now I can't remember what this was about :/ 




 If you are fortunate enough to have a good life, give a little. Help a friend or family member out or volunteer. Thinking of others in need and not always about yourself gives your life some perspective. 




 Don't worry if you're not perfect. It's okay. You're perfect as you are with all your imperfections. Don't spend your life trying to live up to someone else's expectations. Live the life that you want.

And if your family isn't happy, well that sucks, but you're not alone. And people do care about you.
