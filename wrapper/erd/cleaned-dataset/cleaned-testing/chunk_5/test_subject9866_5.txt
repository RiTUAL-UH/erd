 This is amazing. It's short, yes, but amazing. You and /u/RPWrites are my favourite Reddit-Writers. 

I definitely will be looking into those novels of yours. 




 Anyone know how long this is going on?

 Thank you so much for having Greats on here! I feel as though that as a brand, they don't get enough recognition in the sneaker/streetwear world.

 You sing it too, but your Grandma ain't my Grandma 




 I just recently watched this and is currently my favourite Short Film. 




 Velco Roshes don't exist. Not that I am aware of, at least.

 Could someone link that Filling Pieces? 




 How does one rock Combat Boots like those?
