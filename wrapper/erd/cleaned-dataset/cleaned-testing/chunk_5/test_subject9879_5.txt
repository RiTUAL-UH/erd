 Different universities - different priorities. Penn State for quite a few years have invested in research equipment. Millennium Science Complex facilities rival a national lab today - which is why MatSE is the highest NSF funded department in the nation.  




 Not completely true - we cannot replace book knowledge - yet. And most MechE, EE and MatSE students are heavily involved in research too. I know of several undergrads graduating with journal publications.  




 Steidle is being completely torn down from the inside and renovated right now. The thing is - it costs $50M, and moving equipment was a year long job. Similar thing will happen to Fenske after Steidle.
