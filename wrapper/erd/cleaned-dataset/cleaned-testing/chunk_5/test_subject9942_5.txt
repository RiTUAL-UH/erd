 gender is neurological/psychological, so it exists (it is not a social construct)
even observable behavior patterns for each gender are real

but yea, if there is no 'defined sets of genders, there is no 'transitioning,' you can be born and well what gender are you?? we can't define it if we didn't have male or female.

people think gender roles are checklists, when i see it as more of a guideline. and it just happens, no, someone did not sit down and said, girls will like to shop and boys will prefer sports. Rather, it just happens that these trends are true. 




 in all other languages, the masculine version just gets used in a group of male and female

no one seems to have a problem with that

why should English? 




 I met a girl, in a club space. She explicitly told me she was cis (I hate that term by the way) and then a week later turned genderfluid. We don't talk anymore.

transtrenders claim that dysphoria is not necessary; they might change pronouns on a daily basis. Moreover, you can tell they're just doing it for oppression points or whatever. 




 Serious question

If you are talking to a transgender (person), you would refer to them using you (as you should unless you have quirks that make you use third person referencing in a conversation).

I might refer to a transgender(person): friend (gender neutral), person (gender neutral), but almost never use he/she/they? 

and even if I do refer to them in third person pronouns, they wouldn't be in audible range (to be offended)? (note I'm not saying I want to misgender nor do I not respect their pronouns, I'm speaking theoretically)

for example, I met this person the other day, he was nice and she bought me ice cream. Afterwards, they went home safely. This person doesn't know I'm talking about him/her/them.

so yea, I've almost never had to use their pronouns. Now if you are going to tell me, I just used it here, I would argue I could've used any and they wouldn't know about it. 




 she asked for advice on reddit 2 months before it happened 




 that guy is just putting words in my mouth, things I never said and claims I have misconceptions when he's the one inventing them and accusing me of them

yea, transgenders don't usually have dysmorphia 




 body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria are not the same, they might be connected at times 




 I never indicated all transgenders undergo SRS 




 okay that makes a lot of sense, thanks!
