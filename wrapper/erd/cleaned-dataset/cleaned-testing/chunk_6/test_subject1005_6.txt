 Personally, I get sick of everyone constantly bashing The Happening and posting "what? no!" every time it is mentioned. What do you see way too often? 




 Oh, I misunderstood. I don't suppose they look like anything. Paradise is of course subjective, so I don't believe one is a penthouse suite and the other a fire pit, although there are passages to "lake of fire" in Revelation. Again, that could be imagery. What I meant initially, is I don't know of a movie that accurately shows a person dying and then living in Heaven for the remainder of the movie, or vice versa.  




 Ben Stein actually seems like he'd be a cool dude to bbq with and shoot the shit.  




 I believe in heaven and hell. Everlasting paradise and everlasting misery. I think without taking artistic liberties, its kind of hard to make a movie about. Does that make sense? I could be wrong though. There may be a movie I haven't seen or forgot about.  




 Damn it. I like Tucci, but he really does seem like he's capable of being a real prick in real life.  




 I met Tom Green once after one of his standup shows. His standup, albeit not too great, really humbled himself and he fessed up to knowing he screwed up in showbiz. Kind of made you think the guy was approachable and not just a total weirdo. So, afterwards, I walk up to him just to thank him for his work and whatnot, and the man wouldn't even look me in the eye and respond accordingly. He had this shitty "oh great another fan" way about him that really turned me off from him.    




 Unload your garbage here.  




 Depends on your views of the afterlife ;) As a Christian, there aren't too many movies (at least not that I can think of right now) that depict the afterlife as I believe it. I'm going to go with Beetlejuice. I think it was a super creative approach to the subject.  




 You could go either way here. Ace displayed a lot of lunacy when he was playing chicken with the truck. He was obviously prepared to be killed in order to prove his balls were huge. However, you don't see that same kind of ballsiness when he's held at gunpoint. He allows himself to submit in front of his friends and walk away defeated. This all being said, I think he is capable of killing Chris BUT it also may have just been another game of chicken.  




 Reddit knows who he is, thank you.  




 Elliot, so Smelliot, whats up dudester? 




 and I worry about the dolphins 




 How did he disappear?  




 Watch it again. Still holds up.

 Can you do a Mummy porn? Rick and Evie but then Imotep shows up and joins in? 




 RAUUUUUUUUUL 




 How dare she have a face! The nerve... 




 What the hell is the matter with you? 




 I'm just razzin. I mean, you never know, but I doubt it. 




 Rumor is he won't take a part unless half his lines can be screamed in someone's face.  




 Charming, suave, loveable? I agree. Fuck him.  




 They play only ONE character and any deviation is uncomfortable and awkward. Who fits that bill? 




 You gave me this tiny winkie 









 There's so much content in the Bible that it is very easy to forget and overlook aspects like this. This was helpful for me too, and I really appreciate you posting. Thank you :) 




 I don't care what Neal's doing. Where's Charlie? 




 You like Osso Bucco, Charlie?
