 My fianc, but the remote to the tv is in the other room 









 I'm moving to Providence in the coming month with my fianc.  I'm 31 and with no children.  I've been told I would like downtown or east side Providence (not East Providence).  I know nothing about the area.  Any suggestions on neighborhoods, apartments or surrounding areas to live or avoid would be great.  -thanks  














 Is there not an appropriate time? 




 Sagging pants.  It's really stood the test of time from the 90s on
