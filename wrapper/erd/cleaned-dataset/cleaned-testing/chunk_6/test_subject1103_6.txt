 I bought this phone 4 months ago, and still waiting.

 Does every hairy arm have a Time? 




 Serious? Thanks I was just about to buy one!

 It's inconceivable to think I was having these problems and now I'm not. It's funny, because that's how life is. First you're a kid crying; hitting your head on the pole, then one day you're the adult wondering why you put the pole there. Haha, enjoy these ephemeral problems.  




 When you hear/read/look/touch/see something you usually don't bat an eye twice or turn your head or say, "what?" hoping to hear it again, nor wish to see it once more. When you see it, you will know.  




 That price is ridiculous, is it made out of king's skin or something?   




 Thought it said, candles.

 You're my favorite YA Author. My question is this, "Why do you think people should read in general?" Basic question, but I'm curious as to what an expert such as yourself would say.

 M'lady.

 People don't  read? I read a lot. Hmm... are you an educated  individual?  I don't play video games or watch  tv. Call me crazy, but I read. Read a chapter before I came across this page, actually. **YOU'RE** *JUST EITHER LAZY OR STUPID*

edit: see /r/books, people do read- 5 mill subs- it's just you and your shitty-ass habits. I'm glad you don't read, so I can manipulate you one day, since you fail to realize the readings. What you don't know doesn't hurt you ;) Knowledge for power is my motto.
