 My brother Teddy died on December 11th, 1999 during our annual family Christmas party. He was 12 and I was 9. I wish I could say it wasnt my fault, but at the end of the day, the whole thing had been my idea. 

I'm from Woodbury, Minnesota as is my entire extended family. Every Christmas my parents would host a holiday party to eat, drink and gossip. It was always a boring event but I loved seeing all my cousins. The adults usually stuck us kids in the basement or the loft but that year my brother convinced them to let us go sledding at the park instead. 

We bundled up in our purple Vikings parkas and loaded up the sleds with blankets and our pockets with hand-warmer packets. Then me, my brother, and our cousins Mike and Jeff set off for the sledding hill which was about a half mile down the road. 

As soon as we were out of view of the house, Teddy stopped. 

You guys wanna do something fun? He asked. 

Hell yeah! 

Of course! 

I want to go sledding." I muttered. 

"Yeah, well, sledding is for babies, said Jeff. 

"That's what I was thinking too!" His brother added. 

Teddy smiled. Good. Because I want to take you guys somewhere *way* more awesome. 

"Where are we going? I asked nervously. Mom and dad will get mad if they look for us in the park and we're not there." 

"They wont look, theyre too drunk, Teddy laughed. 

"But-" 

I think we should go to Rocking Horse Creek." He added coolly. 

Rocking Horse Creek was actually more of a small river than creek but it had been called that for as long as I can remember. The creek had been named by neighborhood kids whod found an almost life-sized rocking horse sitting abandoned and half submerged in the water. No one knew where it had come from just as no one knew the actual name of the river. Because no one had ever been stupid enough to tell their parents that they went there. 

"But Rocking Horse Creek is almost an hour walk from here!" I whined. I was already cold and didn't feel like walking that far. 

Mike snorted. "Pfft, dont be a baby. There're extra blankets if you're cold plus hand-warmer packets in your pockets. 

Yeah, Jeff added, and if you want we can pull you along in the sled just like the baby you are! 

Mike and Jeff laughed. But Teddy didnt and he punched Jeff in the arm. 

Stop it, you guys! Im not a baby! And why go to the creek anyway? It's probably ice." 

"Because it will look hella cool! Teddy said. 

"Yeah, I want to go!" said Mike. "We could tie our jacket strings to some sticks and go ice fishing!" 

"Yeah!" 

"Well, Im really good at ice fishing, I lied, So I *have* to go so I can help you. 

*Sure* you are. Jeff rolled his eyes. 

The walk didn't take an hour; it was more like 35 minutes, though it did feel longer due to the cold. When we approached we saw that the river was indeed frozen over. The ice looked several feet thick, though it was hard to tell. Jeff and Mike were really excited about it and kept testing their weight on the thinner ice of the riverbank. 

I sat down on my sled and drew a couple blankets around me. *Im smaller than them so Im colder*, I justified to myself. Ted, Mike and Jeff stood on the riverbank and threw rocks onto the ice to see if they could break it. When they failed to produce even the smallest crack, Jeff announced it was time to play Ricochet Dare. 

I hated Ricochet Dare. As soon as Jeff suggested it I felt a cold stone drop into the pit of my stomach. Ricochet Dare was something we'd been playing since we were little kids. The rules stated that if you were dared to do something and you didnt do it the game would end and you would be the new "Wuss" (and this ridicule would go on for weeks or even months). However, if you did do it then you got to dare someone in return. Generally, the dares start off mild but with every round the stakes get higher. The game would only end when someone inevitably wussed out. And, of course, that person was usually me. 

*But not this time*, I thought as I shrugged off the blankets and stood up, pushing my hat up from my eyes. I had to redeem myself and make Teddy proud. I had to show them I wasnt a baby. 

"Come on!" Jeff yelled at me. "You go first!" 

"Okay. What's the dare?" I asked with false bravado. 

"Hmm..."Jeff said. "Okay, you have to take 3 steps out onto the ice." 

I eyed the frozen river warily. "Three steps?" 

"Yep, and not *baby* steps, real steps." 

Stop it, Im not a baby! 

Then prove it. 

I took my first step lightly and paid close attention to the give of the slippery mass beneath me. There was none that I could feel and the ice made no sound of protest underneath my feet. I took the two last steps quickly and then turned around and half-skated back to shore. My brother gave me a huge smile and a high five. 

I dared Mike to take 4 and half steps. Mike dared Ted to do 6 steps. Ted dared Jeff to do 10 steps. And then Jeff dared me to walk all the way to the opposite shore. 
The ice hadn't made a sound since we had started the game, instead remaining as silent as death. Still, there was something unsettling stringing through the cold air and the silence. 

I stalled for as long as I could, trying to decide if I should complain. Jeff's dare was actually two dares and I didn't think that was fair. Technically I would have to do it twice: once to get to the opposite shore and once to get back. I was afraid of falling through to the cold water I knew was raging by under the ice. 

"Come one, don't be a baby, just do it." Mike said. 

"Little baby-waby afraid of the icy-wisy?" Jeff mocked. 

"Stop it you guys, I'm not a baby! This dare isn't fair - it's two dares!" 

My voice was drowned out by Jeff and Mike's mock baby cries. I looked at Teddy for help but he was laughing. *Laughing*. My older brother didnt even attempt to stick up for me, he was joining in with them! 

I felt my lower lip wobble and tears fill my eyes. *Dont cry! Babies cry, youre not a baby!* I jerked my head back to river so they couldn't see my red face and traitorous tears. I felt a sob begin to bubble up through my throat and I knew I couldnt let them hear it. 

I would die before I'd let them see me cry. 

I took a deep breath and ran across the ice as fast as I could. And for a moment I actually hoped I did fall through. They would be in so much trouble and they would feel so sorry that theyd made fun of me and called me a baby. With every slap of my boot I listened for the telltale sound of cracking ice. But none came and before I knew it I was on the other side. 

I raised my fists in the air triumphantly and waited to hear their cheers. When I turned to look back, they were still standing in a circle together, laughing. They hadn't even been watching me. They missed the entire dare. 

And I wanted to cry all over again. 

I swallowed the tears and was about to yell that I wanted to go home. But just then, I noticed something dangling from the tree above them. How had I forgotten? I was the only one who'd noticed it and I realized it was my ticket to revenge and redemption. But who to dare? 

I stood silently watching them as they joked with each other and pointed at each of them in turn, silently mouthing to myself. 

"Eeny, meeny miny, moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go, eeny meeny miny moe." 

My finger landed on Teddy. *Good*, I thought. *He's supposed to be my brother, he deserves it the most.* 

I cleared my throat. 

"I dare" I yelled across the small river, interrupting them. They turned to look at me, almost surprised to see me standing on the other shore. So they *had* forgotten about me. 

"I dare," I started with renewed anger, "TEDDY to rope swing across the creek and land on this side." 

There was silence as, in tandem, all three looked up at the rope hanging from the tree above them. During the summer we would take turns swinging on it and cannon-balling into the water; and if you pushed off the tree hard enough, you could actually make it to the other side of the creek. Id seen my brother do it many times. 

Teddy's eyes got wide and he looked at me as if I'd sentenced him to death. Jeff and Mike immediately started prodding him, telling him not to be a wuss. I smiled smugly from the other side of the river. I hoped hed fail the dare. Itd be just what he deserved. 

It didn't take much name calling for Teddy to climb the tree and grab onto the rope. He tested it a few times and then hung on it with all of his weight. It held like it always had. 

"When I get over there I'm going to dare you to do jumping jacks in the middle of the creek!" He yelled at me. Thats when I realized my mistake. If Teddy dared me to do that I would most certainly wuss out and then theyd tease me until Easter. I sent a silent prayer up to God that Teddy didnt make it to this side of the river. 

"On three!" Mike yelled to Teddy. 

I watched Teddy count silently to himself and then push off from the tree as hard as he could. He swung in a long, deep arc just like he always did. I watched the scene with my fingers crossed, hoping the rope wouldn't go far enough and that he would have to land back on the other riverbank, his dare unfilled and the game ended. 
But I could tell immediately that he was going to make it and somberly stepped backward to make room for him to land. 

And then suddenly the loudest sound Ive ever heard before or since rang through the air 
like a gunshot. 

*GROAN* 

*SNAP* 

Teddy broke through as soon as he hit the ice and the rope and tree branch followed him down into the darkness below. I felt my feet moving under me as I slipped and slid my way out to where hed gone in, sheer panic crushing my chest like a vice. All three of us were on our bellies groping into the angry, jagged hole within 10 seconds. We searched the watery void but all we could feel was the tree branch below us. And within a minute, we couldn't feel anything at all- our hands and arms had gone numb. 

Jeff pulled Mike and I to our feet and started running for the sleds. 

"Leave his sled here, we need to get out of here now!" 

I felt cold and dead. I stumbled blindly toward the sound of my cousin's voice. 
"We need to save Teddy. I want Teddy. He's in the ice. We have to get mom and dad." But I was blubbering so badly by the end that I doubt they understood a word of it. And despite my slurred protests, I followed them through the woods, confused and cold. 

But after a while I couldnt feel the cold anymore. I couldnt feel any pain, in my heart or my body. In fact, I couldn't feel anything at all. 

Mike didn't say a word for the entire walk back but Jeff went on and on about the "plan". 

We would just say that Teddy decided to go home before us and that he had said he was going to take a shortcut through the woods - the other woods on the far side of the road. 

I just nodded for awhile, even smiled at his plan. God, to this day I dont know why I smiled. We were almost home by the time I began to process what he was saying. 

"No. I have to tell dad to save Teddy." I told him. I was surprised by how flat my voice sounded. 

Mike just kept walking forward in a daze but Jeff whirled on me. 

"Its too late to save him but you can save yourself! Its your fault this happened because it was your dare. They will take you to jail for murder and put you on death row; its an open and shut case. You can't tell anyone anything. Ever." 

And I dont know why I believed him, but I did.

The hardest part of the day wasnt watching my brother die or the long, cold walk home. The hardest part by far was pretending like nothing was wrong when we got there. 

*What do you mean you haven't seen Teddy? He should have been back by now, he started home an hour before us.* 

I couldn't keep my poker face for very long, though, and I started crying. My dad thought it was because I was so cold that my skin had begun to turn white. 

The adults immediately mounted a search of the woods between our house and the park, which of course, turned up nothing. By nightfall they had called the police. 

Search and Rescue searched the wrong woods for the next 24 hours because they believed our story. The sledding hill had been crowded that day but a couple of people were sure they'd seen us there. 

The day after that they intended to search the other side of the forest - the side Teddy was actually on - but a blizzard rolled in overnight and that search was called off. My parents were told that where ever Teddy was, he was most certainly dead. 

Parents in the neighborhood stopped letting their children play in the woods, even in the summer. My own parents wouldnt let me leave the house for a year. I grew up angry and spiteful. I hated everyone, but no one more than myself. I applied to college just to get away from my parents, whose constant love and support felt vile and wrong to me. I wished they would have another kid so they could give their love to someone deserving and stop talking about Teddy all the time. 

I got into U of M. My grades sucked and I drank a lot. My parents pressured me to excel since I was their last horse in the race. I never returned their calls or emails. 

I lived with the guilt; just barely, but I lived with it. If nothing else, I could take a bit of pride in the fact that I was surviving. 

Drunkenly one night, I finally told a couple of my close friends about it. They agreed that it wasn't my fault, that shit happens, and that Teddy wouldn't want me to dwell on it. I made the dare, but he climbed the rope. 

That night was a turning point for me. After being validated by people who actually knew the truth, I cut back on the drinking and I picked up my grades for the last two semesters. 
And somehow, it was enough to graduate. 

A year later I got an invitation to an engagement party at my parents house. Cousin Jeff was getting married to a girl he'd met in the navy and I was invited to celebrate their love with them. As much as I always hated going back home, I wanted to support Jeff. Somehow, just knowing that he was living a full life despite our shared burden made me feel hopeful, like I could too. 

The party was quieter and more reserved than the parties my parents threw when we were kids. They had become less fun since Teddys death: more refined, more somber. Jeff was quieter than I remembered, too, but he was clearly happy with his new fianc, who seemed like a very nice girl. And though a wide smile was spread across his face, his eyes betrayed a certain guardedness, especially when he looked at me. 

I got up the courage to talk to him only once. We shared an awkward hug and I congratulated him on his engagement and asked him about his brother. Jeff told me that 
Mike was addicted to heroin and living in Arizona somewhere. I said that it seemed Mike had never really recovered. Jeff said he didnt know what I was talking about and walked away. 

I spent the rest of the party hugging relatives, making small talk and pretending to drink (sobriety is suspect in my family). After awhile I went outside to take in a cigarette and a moment of peace. And in the secrecy of the autumn air, I started to cry. 

This party should be boisterous and loud. My parents should be lively and laughing. Mike should be running around the party daring people to take mystery shots. I should be cheerfully telling stories from college and talking about my plans for graduate school. And Teddy should be here instead of lying dead at the bottom of a river bed. 

I flicked my cigarette under my car and wiped the wetness from my cheeks. I knew what I had to do and where I had to go. 

I had to see the river that had haunted me since I was nine. Had anyone been back to Rocking Horse Creek? Was Teddy's sled still there? Had they replaced the rope? Had the creek dried up? This was my worst fear. It had secrets I didn't want to live to see revealed. 
I lit another cigarette as I walked and began to list all the reasons this was a bad idea. I spent the hike either begging myself to find the strength to turn around or begging for the courage to continue on. 

I arrived at Teddys grave before I was ready. 

The creek was loud and the water was moving quickly - recent rain in the area to blame, no doubt. The rocking horse itself was in bad shape. Only its head was visible above the water now and it was so rotted you could barely tell what it was anymore. No one had replaced the rope. 

I sat down next to the creek and took it all in. It was hard to believe this was the same place from which I still woke up screaming. It seemed to have healed since taking Teddys life. If it could heal, maybe I could heal too. The tree was so full you wouldnt think itd ever lost a single branch. The creek innocently bubbled by, full of life and vigor. Everything here was so different than I remembered. 

Even the rocking horse. 

Where the toy had once been cheerful, almost animated, it was now just a morbid, misshapen head. Its eyes were pointed directly at me and they bore a soulless stare right through me. It sent an involuntary shudder through my body and I turned away from the horses head in revulsion, I immediately saw what the horse had been looking at: a sliver of red plastic jutting out of the ground behind me. 

Teddys sled. 

My reaction was visceral and I had to lean over and vomit in the grass beside me. It was real. It had happened. Had I been pretending it wasnt real? Was that why I had really come here? To pretend that the past was gone and didnt matter anymore? How could I forget that what this place really was? 

I stumbled to my feet and began walking down the riverbank away from the buried sled, pausing every few feet to dry heave. I just wanted to get away from it, that thing that was all that remained of my brother. Everything that used to be Teddy lay at the bottom of the river now. I pulled a cigarette from my pack with shaking hands. As I tried to light it I tripped over something and fell forward, my cigarette rolling down the riverbank and into the water. 

It was a rope. And I knew right away that it was Teddys rope. 

I kicked it away from me, it was worse than the sled. If I had anything left to throw up, I know I would have. The end of the rope lay deteriorating on the riverbank with the length of it disappearing into the murky water of the river. And maybe I am morbid or sick or crazy, but I suddenly I decided that I wanted to know, I wanted to see. 

I crawled over to it and picked it up. It felt just as it did all those summers ago when I used to swing from it into the water as Teddy clapped from the shoreline. 

I began to pull the rope out of the river. 

The water was fast moving and the rope was heavy. The creek didnt want to give up its secrets so easily and it rebelled against my efforts. Still I pulled harder. Just as I felt I was coming to the end of it, something long and thin breached the surface of the river. I saw it for only a moment before the rotted rope snapped and it sank back into the dark abyss. 

I almost dove in after it. But as I stood on the riverbank, my brain screaming at me, I realized what Id almost done. What if that was Teddy? Would I want to see? 

Breaking from my trance, I hurled the rest of the rope into the water and fled into the woods. My lungs struggled to draw breath and the trees began to spin around me. I anxiously lit yet another cigarette and let the shudders wrack through my body as I waited for the nicotine to calm me. 

I stood there, in the middle of the woods, the broken rope 20 feet behind me at the bottom of the river and took short drags off my cigarette. And when my breathing had become bearable again, I felt someone watching me. 

It was Teddy, of course. He sat with his back against a tree, faded purple parka still bright in the mid afternoon sun, and in some parts bleached almost as white as his bones. Ripped foil from an opened hand-warmer packet was clutched in his hand, still remaining after all these years. He stared at me accusingly; the deep eye sockets of his skull were somehow not empty, instead they held a knowing consciousness that said he knew what we had done. He knew we'd left him to die. 

*But we hadn't known that, Teddy! We hadn't! We didn't know you crawled out of the river. We didn't know you were freezing to death as we ran home to bury our secrets! We would have saved you, Teddy, if we had known! You know that. We would have saved you!* 

I yell this at the skeleton, in my head or out loud I'm not entirely sure. But Teddy just sits there staring me; thirty yards from the rocking horse, twenty yards from the broken tree. And I know he'll sit here forever. Because Jeff and Mike don't need to know that our sins are far more terrible than we'd ever thought. I know it is only my burden to bear. And I can tell as he watches at me in the fading sunlight that Teddy agrees.

 You're not alone. As of today, nosleep is blocked at my office and my SO's office. Category:Porn. We're stumped. 
 




 Thanks so much!
 




 Thanks for this! 




 I'm really surprised the top comment isnt "my dick".  




 According to his post history, he's a "fifteen and half" year old kid.  




 Bees?  









 I would watch the party announcements as they roll out- they're well worth it. Vegas really does it right. I'd start [here.](http://www.buffettnews.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40 t=93180)  




 The reason I didn't go to work. 
http://imgur.com/ACAmvgo 




 Most schools are closed anyway. My office sent an email not to bother coming to work. Snow day!!! 




 My kid's school is in a delay but we called her out. We'd have to take 2 highways to get there.  




 Nobody in my house went to work today.  




 When I was a kid I lived in a beautiful house. My mother and my older sister were artists; they painted, sculpted and danced their way through life, challenging and inspiring each other. They created and scrapped works of art in a constant rotation. Our house was forever changing and evolving into something new like it had an organic, vibrant life of its own. 

My memories of those days and that house are so very vivid. 

Our family room was usually some shade of orange (my sister had painted it for me - orange was my favorite color).

We had a marble bird-shaped fountain in the middle of the kitchen (which I used to splash my mom and sister),

There was a sculpture of a small dancing man on our landing (which I always high-fived), 

And of course, the hallway that was painted floor-to-ceiling with fish (which I always laid on the floor to "swim" through).

And, finally, my favorite thing of all, a staircase that my sister had painted like piano keys (although I'm pretty sure it's only because she was in love with her piano teacher). 

In short, my house was a magical place that the neighborhood kids couldn't stay away from. Suffice it to say I had a lot of friends.

Since we had the most exciting house in the county, people would always ask to come over and visit. My parents threw countless BBQs, dinner parties, open houses; just give them something to celebrate and theyd throw a party. 

I had so many wonderful memories of my life from before the night Anna died. I had so few of the night that it happened. And, perhaps worst of all, I had no memory of the only moment that really mattered. Until I did. 

My father owned a locksmith company with my Uncle Peter and they were out on call that night. I think mom was home in her room but I can't quite remember.  She was gone a lot in those days. It wasn't until I was older that I learned there were whispers of an affair between my mother and Samuel, the curator of a local art gallery. But that night I'm sure I remember piano music coming from her room. Anna was in bed because she had an early meeting at the gallery to unveil her newest canvas. And I was in my room as usual playing Tomb Raider on my Playstation. 

At some point in the night I think I must have heard a noise because I remember pausing my game and cracking my door to look out into the hallway. I recall staring down the corridor toward the staircase trying to adjust my eyes to the dark. I thought there may be someone there so I came out fully into the hallway to see. I remember that for some reason I was afraid to turn on the light so I squinted down the hallway .

There was someone staring back at me. Someone in the dark, someone who had just come up the stairs, someone...I recognized. He stayed completely still, perhaps wondering if I could see him too. 

As he stared at me I began feel scared. I wanted to run toward the light-switch but I didn't have the courage. And then, suddenly, in a single breath the figure was moving, sprinting down the hallway toward me.  Too afraid to scream, I fell over backward and scrambled into my room as I watched the figure run into Anna's bedroom. I don't remember anything else from that night. Not screaming from Anna's room. Not hiding under the bed. Not falling asleep. 

Uncle Peter and my dad had come home together that night after finishing their call. They spent the night drinking in the garage, which was the only room my mother never touched (and the only room my father could relax in). So it was Uncle Peter that found Anna the next morning. She had been beaten to death; her head was completely caved in. I wish I didn't know that but adults talk loudly when they're upset. 

I spent the day hiding under my bed, plugging my ears and crying.

My mom was hysterical; screaming and crying so loudly that an ambulance came to take her to the hospital. My father, not knowing what else to do, sent me to stay with Uncle Peter and Aunt Lydia for awhile. It was only a day later that the police showed up at my uncle's door and asked to talk to me.

They sat me down in the living room and my aunt brought me a glass of chocolate milk. They asked me if I had seen anything that night and I told them I had. They asked me what happened and I told them what I knew. They asked me who it was that I'd seen in the hallway and I faltered. 

I couldn't remember.

They kept at me until I cried. It felt like hours. My uncle stood in the doorway watching as the detectives asked me the same questions over and over again. Was he tall? Short? Did he have long hair? Was he old or young? What was he wearing? But try as I might, I simply couldn't remember anything. All I knew was that I recognized him. The detectives tried to hide their frustration and anger but ultimately failed. At one point I was so scared of them I thought of making something up. But I didn't want to send anyone I knew to jail.

My parents didn't talk to me at the funeral and it was clear to me that they'd heard about my failure to identify Anna's killer. David the piano teacher talked to me, though, and he cried. I guess he'd had a crush on Anna, too. Most of mother's art friends came over with a few kind words to say. My teacher was there. Samuel the curator didn't come at all.

A few days after the funeral, a child psychologist came to my uncles house. She asked me the same questions the police did, but in a much gentler way. She didn't get mad at me when I didn't know the answers, either. I heard her tell my aunt and uncle that I had repressed the memory of what I saw and that it happens sometimes when a child is involved in a traumatic event. Uncle Peter asked if I would ever remember who it was. The psychologist said that one day something may trigger it again, but not to pressure me. My uncle nodded, gravely.

A week after that I was sent back home. Or at least, sent somewhere that used to be home. The walls of my house were now all white or gray. The bird fountain was gone, the undersea hallway was gone, the sculpture was gone. Anna's piano stairs were now covered in dark brown carpet.  I found my mom drinking a glass of wine and painting over the stars on the floor of the entryway. She didn't look at me for another week. She didn't speak to me for a month.

My once bright, lively home was now the color of Anna's tombstone. I was left alone in my room most of the time. Occasionally my mother would come by and ask matter-of-factly if I remembered yet who it was that had murdered her baby girl. But I hadn't. The asking turned to pressing, the pressing to demanding and the demanding, finally, to hysteria. My father had to stop her from shaking me and screaming at me several times but I didn't mind it. They were the only interactions I had with my mom, anymore. 

Once in a while a detective would come by to talk to me but I never had anything new to tell them. My mother took me to a renowned hypnotist behind my father's back and I woke up screaming in hysterics. To my mother's disappointment I hadn't said anything during the session and didn't remember what I'd seen while I was under. My dad was pissed when he found out. 

I really did try very hard to remember. I lay in bed every night for four years squeezing my eyes shut and screaming at my brain to show me what my eyes had seen. But it was no use. The memory was there, I could still see the figure in the darkness. But it had no face.

And because I *knew* that the person I'd seen that night was someone I knew, someone who was probably still around, I was constantly afraid. I hid from my uncle, Samuel, my mother's art friends, even my dad. 

But worse then all of that was just knowing that Id failed Anna. I fell asleep in tears more nights than not.

Eventually I was old enough to go away to college. I stopped crying at night and started drinking instead. It came to a point where I couldn't fall asleep unless I was blackout drunk.  I no longer wanted to remember what I'd seen. It had been too many years; the wounds were old and finally starting to heal. I didn't need to know the truth of what happened that night and I convinced myself it didn't matter anymore, anyway. 

As graduation neared I was surprised to hear from my dad that my mother was planning to attend the ceremony.  I spent all of my summers and holidays on campus and I hadn't spoken to her in four years. I was hesitant didn't know what to expect.

When the day came, I nervously waited for my parents car to pull up outside of my apartment. As soon as she got out of the car, my mom threw her arms around me and cried. She apologized for abandoning me when I needed her most and she begged my forgiveness. I hugged her back and told her how much I'd missed her. It had taken 18 years, but my mom was finally getting better and it was the happiest day of my life. My parents asked me to come home after graduation and live in my old room while I looked for a job. As any broke, homeless, new graduate would, I excitedly agreed.

I drove home on a Friday and found a surprise graduation party waiting for me when I arrived. And that wasn't even the best part. The best part was that my house was no longer shades of gray and death- it was a menagerie of color and life again. Life that had been breathed back into my childhood home, even dad didn't seem to mind it anymore. The fountain, the fish hallway, they were all back! 

I spent the night laughing and clinking glasses with people I hadn't seen since the funeral. David the piano teacher was there, married now, with his youngest son. Uncle Peter shook my hand and told me I'd become a fine young man. Aunt Lydia hugged me tightly. Some of mother's art friends were there, too, and they hadn't changed at all- they still talked loudly and often. 

Close to midnight, though the party was in full swing, I decided I needed a break to just quietly appreciate how life could take you to rock bottom and then raise you back up in such eloquent ways.  I wandered around the house, quietly admiring some of my mother's new pieces.

I made it upstairs and found that my room had been converted into a more respectable, adult bedroom with a flat screen and a computer desk. And I was happy to see they'd left me my PS1! I peaked into my parent's bedroom, too, and admired the Saharan theme before walking down the hall to come face to face with the very last bedroom - Anna's. I leaned my head against the closed door for a few moments and sighed deeply.

"I'm sorry, Anna," I whispered before pushing the door in.

Anna's room was a mausoleum. It looked exactly as it had the night she'd died only the bed was made with different linens and the carpet had been replaced. All the blood covered up or cleaned away. I couldn't bring myself to go in.

I suddenly heard a wooden creak on my right and snapped my head toward the staircase. A man was coming up the stairs and he had paused on the landing to lean against the dancing man statue and turned to smile at me. My glass fell to the floor to shatter at my feet.

You'd think a repressed memory would come back to you slowly, ebbing and flowing like a wave on a beach, leaving behind tendrils of the truth with each swell. But it wasn't like that at all. As soon as I saw his face, I knew, and I remembered everything. 

The dancing man stared up at me from beside Samuel on the landing. And even though it hadn't moved, I could feel it staring back at me. 

The panic began to well in my chest just as they did all those years ago, when the dancing man had climbed the stairs to stare at me in the darkness.  I remember it all now. I remember, too, Annas screams when the statue entered her room. I remember my mothers piano gently playing Vivaldi over the sounds of my sisters bones cracking and her flesh tearing. 

I remember when the dancing man, covered in blood, appeared at my door and danced to my mother's music, his smile growing bigger and toothier every second. And I remember when he danced away, leaving a dark trail of my sisters blood behind him. I remember everything now.

 Fascinating response! 




 It's Jillian.  




 It had promised to be an awesome day. My dad was finally going to take me deep sea fishing off the east coast of the island. Like most kids on the island I wasn't allowed on the east beach. It was for a stupid reason, of course: a mile out from the east shoreline there was a 500 ft drop off, an undersea cliff, and they didn't think it was "safe" for us. 

I think my dad agreed to take me to the east beach because of the divorce. Both of my parents were trying to win custody of me. They wanted me to choose. I just wanted my family back.

We made a plan to boat around the reefs for awhile, snorkel and let me practice my free-diving. I had been working on it for a year and I could already free-dive down to 21 feet! I wanted to break the world record one day. We found deeper and deeper places for me to dive as we wandered around the unfamiliar reefs and sand bars.

After we had finished exploring a sunken speedboat I decided to sunbathe and snooze for awhile. Dad got behind the helm to take us to our next location.

I was awoken by the shrill ring of my dad's phone. He cut the engine so that he could hear the person on the other end of the line. I thought it must be his divorce lawyer because he decided to take the call below deck.

I peered over the side of the boat into the crystal clear waters and saw that the ocean floor was about 30 feet down. I wondered if I could free-dive that. Then I heard my dad yelling below deck and I realized he must be talking to my mom. I covered my ears, I didn't want to hear that. I decided to try the 30 foot dive just for a reason to get off the boat.

I took several long, deep breaths and dove into the lucid, sparking water. I made it down ten feet easily and then 15,  I struggled to 20 and then 25...I was doing it!  I was almost there, I just needed to touch the seafloor and I could claim victory! I was so close, just a little more, I can make it, I can do it! My lungs began to burn, and I could feel the panic welling.  And then, I was there. 30 feet down! 

I quickly braced my legs and pushed off against the sea bed, jettisoning myself up toward the surface. My chest and my head were aching severely now. I swam up as hard as I could, hoping I hadn't made a terrible mistake. Darkness peaked around the corners of my vision. My arms and legs began to feel weak. This had been such a stupid idea, I was going to drown here. 

And then, suddenly, I broke the surface.  I took the deepest breath I've ever taken and tread water for a few minutes as I tried to recover. I'd done it!

I climbed up onto the boat just as Dad was coming up the stairs.

"Dad, I did it!"

"Did what?"

"I free-dove down like 30 feet and touched the seabed! See?"

I looked over the side of the boat.

"Oh actually it only looks about 20-25 feet." I said quickly. "But that's still a personal record!"

My dad raised his eyebrow and went to look over the side of the boat. I peered down with him.

"Oh...well now it only looks like around 15 feet. Nevermind, I guess." I frowned.

Dad backed up from the bow and started shaking his head.

"Oh my god..." He whispered. 

"What?"

"Sarah, we passed the drop off a quarter mile ago."

"But..."

He started running for the wheel. 

"Dad, wha-, what's wrong?" I yelled, alarmed.

I didn't understand. The seafloor was there, I'd touched it just a moment ago. I looked over the edge again.

5 feet...

 Irina was convicted of manslaughter. They had her on tape injecting Holly, there was no way for her lawyers to argue around that. 




 I'll try. 




 I wonder this as well. "It's waiting for you" doesn't necessarily mean it's just one thing. "It" could be a place as well. I just don't know.  




 Fine with me, I honestly don't even know what it is.  




 Ive always felt a little lost in life, like I never received complete instructions on who I'm supposed to be. Everyone else around me seemed to know exactly who they were. Their lives would fly right by me; their GPSs locked on to destinations while I just sat idling in the street. In high school I never did any extracurricular activities because I couldn't figure out if I was a sports person or a music person. And it was no different in college. I wandered through four different majors, unable to decide who I wanted to be. I just felt like a blank slate.

And if I was a blank slate, Micah York was The Starry Night - authentic, beautiful, perfect. He was my exact antithesis which is what attracted me to him in the first place. He was born knowing *exactly* who he was and what he was about. His confidence and certainty in himself was an all but tangible element of him.

We first met in our freshman year of college; he was a Neuroscience student and I was majoring in History. We dated our sophomore year, after I changed my major to Computer Sciences. We broke up in our junior year, just before I decided I wanted a degree in Psychology, instead. And he asked me a favor our senior year, just after my guidance counselor told me it was too late to switch majors again.

Our last semester of college was beginning soon and Micah had been applying to grad schools. He wanted to get his Masters in Neurobiology and I helped him with the applications when I had time. I knew Micah was under a lot of stress to nail his senior thesis so I was surprised when he asked me over to his house for a party that January. I should have known something was up because Micah was a meticulous student and he didnt throw parties  ever.

When I arrived at his off campus apartment, I considered not even getting out of the car. His flat was dark and quiet, there was definitely no party. Just what was he up to? I picked up my phone to call Micah and beg off but curiosity suddenly got the better of me and I hung up.

When I walked into the familiar TV-less living room I saw two familiar faces and two strange ones.

There was Micah, of course, and Micahs friend Sean Nichols, an Organic Chemistry major. The other two people were introduced to me as Irina Bradley, another med student, and Holly Bishop, a Philosophy major.
Irina the med student scooted over and made room for me on the couch. I sat down hesitantly and waited for Micah to begin whatever it was he was doing. He rose and walked to the middle of the room.

"Thanks for coming, guys. Im sure youre wondering why youre here because, clearly, this isnt a party. The truth is I have something of vital importance to ask each of you.

Micah paused, for effect Im sure, took a deep breath and dropped his voice an octave.

I have selected each of you to take part in the greatest experiment of not only your lives but perhaps even in human history. I am asking you to take part in my doctoral thesis."

I rolled my eyes. Classic Micah. He may be many things, but humble wasnt one of them. Jackass appeared to be, though. 

"And what is your thesis?" I asked him nonchalantly, as if his previous statement hadnt been utterly stupid.

"A conclusive essay detailing what happens after human death.

Irina the med student laughed. Sadly, I knew Micah well enough to know he was being serious.

"How do you intend to prove anything?" I asked. "What kind of experiments have you designed?

"Well, Bridget, Im going to kill myself."

The room fell quiet and Micah, mistaking the shocked horror for awed silence, stood a little taller and finally smiled.

"You can't be serious."

"Oh, I am and it's completely reversible. I am going to be the first person in the *world* to prove or disprove the existence of an afterlife."

"We," demanded Sean.

"Yes, we. This paper is going to be our ticket into any university in the world. Wars have been waged for centuries over deities and religions and we are going to prove what is scientifically correct beyond a shadow of a doubt!"

"You're an idiot," I sighed and rose from the couch to leave. Irina followed me but Micah beat us to the door.

"Bridget, wait! At least hear all of it before you walk away. Please."

I narrowed my eyes at him and shook my head.

I want no part in killing anyone. Even you.

"I'd like to hear how it works." Holly the Philosophy major coolly cut in  from her spot on the couch.

"Ah, actually, it's something *I* developed." Sean said. "A cocktail of biological and non-biological chemicals. It's been tested and it's safe."

"*Tested*?" Irina asked in horror. "On whom?"

"On local wildlife.

"So never on a person. I said.

"Not yet but it *is* safe. Sean said quickly.

"So then how *does* it work?" Irina asked. She took a step back toward the couch and thats when I knew they had her.

Micah gestured to Sean.

"I've developed a poison and a biologic. I call them the Romeo and Juliet serums. Juliet is a poison that kills the body. Romeo is a biologic, or antidote for lack of a better word, that revives it."

"Clinical death will only take place for 30 seconds. Micah cut in. No brain damage, no organ damage."

Yes, it truly is perfectly safe; the body will only be dead for a short time. Sean confirmed.

"So, Flatliners." I glared at Micah.

"What?" Sean asked.

"Flatliners, it's a movie. The characters kill themselves and bring themselves back. If I recall it didn't work out too well for them in the film. But Micah knows that since hes obsessed with it.

"That's a Hollywood movie. Micah said, dryly. This is legitimate science."
"No, you're Kiefer Sutherland, I pointed at him, he's Kevin Bacon," I pointed at Sean, "and I'm Julia fucking Roberts!"

"No," Micah said hotly, "actually *she's* Julia fucking Roberts!" He pointed to Holly.

"So am I Oliver Platt, then?" asked Irina.

"No one is Oliver Platt!" Micah yelled.

"Well, if we get to choose I'd rather be Oliver Platt than Kevin Bacon." Sean interrupted.

"Sean, you're fucking Kevin Bacon." Micah spat.

"And you're Keifer Sutherland!" I yelled at him.

"THIS ISN'T FUCKING FLATLINERS!"

I sighed. "So I'm not going under."

"No." Micah looked exasperated.

"Then why am I here?"

Micah combed his hand through his dark brown hair. "Jesus, I've been trying to get to that.

"Am I going under?" Irina asked.

"No, just me, Sean and Holly."

"And you think she's going to *agree* to that?"

"Actually," Holly interrupted, rising from the couch. "I already have."

"Why?" I gaped at her.

"Because I want to know, I *need* to know why I'm here, why any of us are here. I want to know what the soul is and where it goes, I want to hold the keys to human existence, love and suffering, life and death. I want to understand our purpose. And I'm getting paid and it's perfect for my dissertation."

"That's another thing," Micah said quickly, "everyone will get paid."

"How much?" Irina narrowed her eyes at him.

"$500 each."

I groaned. $500 was pretty much how short I was on tuition for this semester and Micah knew that. What an ass.

"The Romeo and Juliet serums are safe. They've been tried and tested and they *will* work. Sean and I have rented a house on Emerald Street to conduct the experiment. All I need, all I'm asking, is for you to show up, Bridget. Just show up next Saturday."

"And what about me?" asked Irina.

"Irina, I need you to administer the serums and monitor vital signs. Look guys, this whole thing will take less than a minute and then you guys can walk away with your five hundred dollars and a credit on my thesis.
"And what makes your evidence, which is pretty much just your testimony, conclusive?" I asked.

"The serums Sean developed will be available to anyone and everyone and they can repeat my experiment at their leisure."

But I dont think that-

"Please, Bridget, just show up on Saturday."

There wasn't one facet of this little science experiment that didn't make me profoundly uncomfortable. But the way Micah looked at me, the tension in the room, the five hundred dollars...

"I'm not asked, Bridget. I'm begging." Micah grabbed my hands and squeezed.

"I'll think about it."

                                    ***

I wasn't really surprised to find myself at the house on Emerald Street that following Saturday. I'd debated about it all week but in the end - all other factors not withstanding - I was curious. Micah was brilliant, top 1% of his class, several published papers; what if he was right? What if he did see something? People have near death experiences everyday and came back with stories. Micah was going deeper into death than anyone ever had ever come back from before and he was doing it in a controlled environment using an experiment that could be easily duplicated. I mean, who knows?

Micah greeted me at the door with a smile that said he knew Id come and walked me to the large, barren living room. It sported tan walls, hardwood floors, lots of hospital equipment and 3 cheap looking twin beds.

Sean and Holly were already laying on two of the beds with nervous smiles on their faces and IVs in their arms. Irina was bustling around checking equipment and looking incredibly stressed.

Micah handed me an expensive looking, heavy camera. "The cameras at the end of our beds are already recording  theyre our static cameras. I need you to walk around and record with this one as well. Irina is going to stagger our injections so that she can handle all three of us. You are simply a witness, nothing more."

"Okay... Micah, are sure you want to do this?"

"Bridget, we've been testing this and as long as Romeo is injected in under a 
minute, which it will be, there is no risk."

"Theres definitely risk, Micah. And near death experiences-"

"This isn't a *near* death experience, it's a *death* experiment. Look, I know youre worried, and thats why I wanted you here, to make sure nothing goes wrong. And even if it does, I have stacks and stacks of notes and narratives proving that this was *my* experiment."

"Yeah, but

I couldn't think of anything else to say. Any objection I had, Micah would have an answer for. That's just the way he was. There was no stopping him now; I could either be here to see it or be somewhere else to hear about it. 
I chose to stay.

Micah walked over to stand in front of my camera.

Its 12:51PM on Saturday, January 14th. I am Micah York and this is the first attempt of the afterlife experiment.

Micah walked over to his bed and sat down, letting Irina expertly thread a needle into his vein. He lay back on the pillow and  turned to Sean and Holly.

"Remember, guys, as soon as you regain consciousness speak directly to your cameras about what you saw.

Yep.

Got it."

"Okay guys," Irina said with a shaky voice. "Everything is ready."

"Alright, Micah said, excitedly, 30 seconds, that's all. Irina, as soon as the last of the Juliet leaves the tube, hit this timer."
Micah pointed to the digital clocks that were set to 00:30 at the head of each bed. Irina nodded.

"Bridget, you film." I swallowed loudly and nodded too.

"See you on the other side," Micah smiled and gave a thumbs up to Holly and Sean who returned it and then settled back on their beds. I hit record.
Irina picked up three red tubes of thick, clear liquid from a nearby table. Steadying her hands, she slowly injected the first tube into Micah's IV, and then hit the timer above him. At the exact moment she did, Micah's heart-rate monitor flat-lined. I jumped at the high-pitched squeal and tried to steady the camera.

Irina hurriedly moved over to Sean and did the same for him and then Holly. Now all three EKG machines were loudly flat-lining. Irina put her hands over her ears for a minute and then pointed to a different monitor.
"Get this! Bridget, record this!" It was Micah's EEG and there were zero active brain waves. "Get Holly and Sean's too!"

I could suddenly taste a bitter metal in my mouth and I knew I was beginning to panic. This had been a bad idea, a very bad idea. By the time I looked back over to Micah's timer there was 8 seconds left on it. Irina had already loaded up a green tube, the Romeo biologic, to Micah's IV and was just waiting to push it in.

The chorus of all three EKG machines wildly sounding their alarms was deafening. It was screaming at us: Do something! DO something! Why are you just standing there? Save them!

Just when I couldnt stand it anymore, a different alarm buzzed and Irina injected the Romeo into Micahs arm. I didn't breathe at all as I waited for Micah's vital monitors to show life. It took less than 5 seconds for the EKG machine to register a spike. And then another. Micah's EEG machine suddenly flared to life as well. I exhaled.

Irina had just stepped over to Sean when Micah suddenly shot up in bed, eyes wide, and opened his mouth. I was so excited and curious that I almost forgot to hold the camera up. I couldnt wait to hear what he had to say.

But Micah didn't say anything. He just screamed. The surprise and force of it made me stumble back into a wall. It was the most blood-curling scream I had ever heard. And then, Sean started screaming, too. Micah took no notice of him and threw himself off the bed to the floor, slamming his head on the wood over and over again. Sean had also jumped out of bed and run over to the wall to stand just 2 inches from it, screaming at it, as if he didn't know the wall was there.

My shock quickly gave way to panic. Micah's head was already bloody and the sound it made against the hard oak was sickening.

"Irina, help me!"

Irina, who hadn't moved since Sean had knocked her out of the way, stared at me wide-eyed.

"We need to get him off the floor, he's hurting himself!"

She opened her palm and looked down at the last tube of Romeo biologic as if she'd never seen it before.

"You didn't give that to her yet?! Give that to Holly! Now!" My voice was high and wild. I was holding Micah in my arms while he continued to hit his head against the air, as if the floor were still there. And the screaming, oh God, the screaming.

Both Micah and Sean were splitting my ears open. The horror on Micah's face as he beat his head harmlessly against the air, mouth open in a wide O and the sharp, agonizing terror coming out of Sean was enough to make me my eyes well up in fear. What had happened? What had they seen?
The camera, long forgotten, lay discarded under Micah's bed where his flailing legs had kicked it. Irina was doing frantic chest compressions on Holly, tears streaming from her eyes. But I knew it was too late, Holly was lost.

"Irina, Irina, call 911." She didn't stop working on Holly, just continued on like she hadn't heard me. And perhaps she hadn't. The screaming...
I let go of Micah just for a moment to grab my phone and he was up and running. He hit the front door and smashing his forehead against the glass.

"Micah, stop!"

If Sean noticed us near him, he didn't show it. He just continued that piercing, horrible scream.

Emergency services couldn't hear me on the phone but they had someone at the house within 5 minutes. A very, very long 5 minutes. Irina gave up on Holly at some point and just paced around the room mumbling "I don't understand. I did it right. I don't understand."

They took Sean, Holly and Micah away in an ambulance and they took me and Irina to the police station. They watched the videos.
I never graduated but at least I didn't go to prison like Irina. I retreated into myself after her trial and refused to speak to anybody. I spent months holed up in my apartment asking the same question over and over.

What did they see?

And it's not like I could ask them. Sean had screamed until he permanently lost the use of his voice. Now he sits in a room in a hospital facing a wall with his mouth wide open as if he were screaming. And somehow, that's worse than the screaming. He hasn't said or written a word since that day.
Micah, he's in a hospital too. Sometimes he screams and sometimes he's quiet. Sometimes he thrashes and sometimes he lies as still as the dead.
I have visited them both many times, begging them to tell me what they saw. But my visits were fruitless until this last time.

Yesterday when I visited Micah he was in his screaming stage. I sat with him and let him scream waiting to see if he would transition to one of his catatonic stages so that I could speak. When I was tired of waiting I leaned in close to his ear and I asked him.

"Micah, what did you see?"

His screaming slowly morphed into an insane, uncontrollable laughter Id never heard before. His doctor, whod been just outside, came running into the room.

"What did you do?" He asked, alarmed.

I just asked him a question." I responded, quietly.

"What was the question?"

"I asked him what he saw."

We both noticed the sudden silence at the same time. We slowly turned toward Micah to find him facing us, no expression on his face.

"It's all waiting for you. It's waiting for all of us." Then his mouth fell open into a large O and the laughter slowly began again followed by shrill, horrible screams.

I left the hospital that day wishing I had never come at all, wishing I'm never met Micah. I drove home with tears pouring down my cheeks. *What did they see? Whats on the other side? Do I even want to know?* But it really doesnt matter anymore. Someday Ill find out. And so will you.

 Thanks! 




 I wonder who the girl was...

[Minnesota sky](http://imgur.com/9FpY5wB)
 




 [United 93.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_93_\(film\)) I just don't think I could handle the emotions.  




 I never learned to drive a stick shift. 




 So many posts about Robin Williams- I'm sure he could have used them yesterday. It's a reminder to always let the people you care about know it- the last chance to is rarely predictable. 




 I live in a backwoods, crappy town in the Midwest. It's a boring, medium sized city carved out of the dense Ozarks of Southeast Missouri. Growing up here had been difficult. I come from a large, violent family and it was no secret that the Cooper kids got beaten. Of course, lots of kids around here get beaten. That's just the kind of town it is.

Since I wasn't allowed to have any friends, I'd concentrated on my grades so that one day I could escape to a 4 year university on the other side of the state. I never thought that after graduating Magna Cum Laude from MSU I would end up back in Harrington, and I might have killed myself if I'd known it.  

I often wondered about where I had slipped up along the way. I'd had a bright, exciting future in front of me, far away from Harrington and the drunken, redneck family I'd left behind. But it didn't seem to be any one thing that brought me back. It was just a series of missteps and bad luck. There was no one thing to blame, which made it all the more frustrating. 

Teaching English at a community college was a far cry from the literary agent I'd dreamed of being. Every day that I woke up in Harrington felt like a failure. The only thing I enjoyed about the town was the crisp nature that surrounded it. My small home backed right up to the Ozarks and every weekend I went hiking in the woods to clear my mind; always taking the same path by the river and always coming home refreshed and content. I considered them my mini-vacations and they kept me sane. 

But it was this very practice of mine that lead to the single most horrific moment of my life. It could have been anyone in town who'd found her - hundreds of people go out into those woods- but it wasn't just anyone, it was me. 

I don't know what came over me that Sunday, but for some reason I didn't want to hike my usual trail. Maybe it was the difficult week I'd had, or the fact that my hand was feeling so very stiff (I'd broken it years before) or perhaps it was because my creepy stalker had been dancing on the fringes of his 100 yard legal restriction all week. Or maybe it was everything combined. For whatever reason, I decided on a change in my routine that day. 

Since I had brought my GPS I decided to let my thoughts and body drift where they may. I wandered lazily and mindlessly, letting the fresh, cool air purify my soul, as it always did.   I thought about the exam I was giving the following week. I thought about taking my dog Clara to puppy training classes. I thought about calling in another complaint about Doug the Stalker. I thought about everything for awhile and then I thought about nothing. 

After about an hour I realized that I had stumbled onto a narrow,  barely visible trail. The crisp, thin morning air was slowly giving way to it's warmer, heavier brother. I decided to follow the trail for a quarter mile or so and then turn around and head back. According to my GPS, I was only about 2 miles from home, which wasn't that far at all.

I lost the trail twice, but was able to pick it up again after a few moments both times. Just as I lost the trail for a third time, the tree line broke and I was suddenly standing in a small clearing. I could tell immediately that there was something not right about this place, something ailing. The grass was yellowed and dead  and an old, gnarled Burr Oak tree sat in the middle of the glade under thin, weak sunlight.

This place was Creeps-town. I took out my phone and snapped a few photos hoping to somehow capture the eerie aura of the clearing.  I walked around the burr oak, stepping over thick, low-hanging branches. I raised my camera to take another photo when something that shouldn't be caught my eye. There was color between the leaves that had no place in the sickly yellows and sullen browns. It was a pink shoe.

I walked closer, curious, and wondering if maybe kids used this place to smoke weed or drink.  But when I got closer, I saw the shoe was far too small for a teenager. It was the shoe of a young child - and there was a young child still in the shoe.

I've felt many horrible things in my life - failure, disappointment, pain - but I have never felt anything so horrible as I did when finding the bones of a small child shoved into the alcove of a tree. She was curled up in the fetal position, her broken body much too large for the tiny little alcove. It was a wonder that she had fit there at all when she was more than just bones. Her clothes were mostly gone, at least on the exposed side, and her skull had cracks and angry indentations. I vomited on the trunk of the tree and then I'm ashamed to say - I ran. 

I ran all 2 miles home, the need to share the burden of this knowledge with someone, anyone, was urgent in me to the point of hysteria. When I finally broke the tree line into my own backyard I fell onto the grass in exhaustion. I stared up at sun, trying to blind myself of the memory. But I could still see that dead little girl.

When I could breathe again, I took my phone from my pocket and dialed the police. They came within minutes and I somehow found the strength to stand and meet them in the driveway. I explained everything that had happened in short, choked sentences and handed them my GPS to show them where the body was. 

An officer wrapped a blanket around me and another brought me bottles of water. After that, everything happened pretty quickly. I sat in my kitchen  and watched out the window as crowds gathered and media arrived. The sound of helicopters came and went from overhead, both police and news choppers alike, I'm sure. I stared out the window shade, praying that the crowds couldn't see me inside. 

As dusk began to settle, I found Doug in the gathered crowd of news correspondents and neighbors.  He was at the very front of the police tape and he watched both the spectacle and my window, evenly. It was the first time he had ever actually broken the restraining order. I tried to find an officer but I found my bed instead. 

The long, emotional day gave way to a deep and sound sleep. When I awoke the next morning, I saw that media vans from St. Louis had arrived and that the cops had set up roadblocks on my street. I called into work that day and the next and finally I told them I wouldn't be coming in the rest of the week. I stayed home and worked on my novel, trying to ignore the circus our town had become. 

Identifying the little girl took almost two weeks but someone in the media had named her "Sarah".  I saw the headline "Who put Sarah in the Burr Oak tree?" land on my front porch one day. It seemed the media was drawing comparisons between our case and the *Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?* case. I never retrieved the paper. 

Finally, the coroner's office released a statement that the 6 year old girl had been identified - name withheld while they notified the family - and that the likely, though not conclusive, cause of death was blunt force trauma. 

Two days later I was asked to come in and give a recorded, official statement to the lead detective on the case. I went over everything I could remember from that day in extreme detail, even seeing Doug in the gathering crowd. The detective nodded his head throughout my testament and then, when I was finished,  pressed stop on the recorder and left the room. 

I drummed my fingers on the table and absentmindedly stared up at the camera in the corner until he returned ten minutes later.

The door opened and the lead detective walked back into the room with a stranger in tow. He was tall, tanned, and sported slicked back white hair. I instantly disliked him.

"Ms. Cooper, this is Dr. Watner. Do you remember Dr. Watner?"

"No. Should I?"

"Not necessarily." The doctor replied. 

"Why am I still here?" 

"Because of Sarah." The detective sat down across from me.

"Is Sarah the girl in the tree?"

"Sarah is your daughter." The doctor answered.

"I don't have a daughter." I said shaking my head.

"Jessica," the doctor began, "we met several years ago when your daughter first disappeared. You blamed a man named Doug Ozinga for taking her, you were hysterical about it. Do you remember that?"

"I know Doug Ozinga, I have a restraining order against him. But that's where my part in this ends, I don't have a daughter." I repeated, slowly.

"Jessica, I'm going to show you some pictures now that might upset you."

The doctor spread three large photos out in front of me. As soon as I saw their content my hands began to shake. But I wasn't afraid. I was confused. 

"I don't remember these pictures. I don't know who that is."

The photos were of me with a young, blonde girl of about 5. We were both smiling and hugging. 

"Do you agree that the person in this picture is you?"

I continued to stare at the photos. There was no denying it, I still had some of the clothes I was wearing in the photo.

"Yes."

"And does the child in this picture look at all familiar to you?"

The answer was no - and yes. She was a stranger but I felt like she was stranger who I'd seen before somewhere. Memories began to tug at the tips of my synapses and I tried to let them in but they were hazy and butted.

"Yes." I murmured, my eyes never leaving the page.

The detective leaned forward in his chair. "I'm so sorry, Jessica. The body that was in the tree has been identified as your daughter, Sarah."

"What..." I was lost, and suddenly feeling terribly alone. "What do I do?"

"I think you should take some more time talking to Dr. Watner, you're going to need support now."

"And what about the little girl? I saw Doug Ozinga on the day the body was found, he was at the crime scene!"

"Yes, I expected that."

The detective stood up then, and Dr. Watner followed.

"We will return shortly. Here," He handed me my phone. "You should research your case. It might help you remember anything else you may be repressing. Would you like me to call your family?"

But I had no family. "No. I'm just really scared and confused right now, I need to think."

"I understand," the detective said as he followed Dr Watner through the door.

"Wait!" I yelled suddenly, rising from my chair. The detective stopped and turned around. "When are you going to arrest Doug Ozinga? Do you have any evidence on him yet?"

"Jessica...Doug Ozinga doesn't exist."

He closed the door behind him and I fell back into my chair. It's been almost two hours and they haven't come back. And it makes me wonder why I'm still here. 

But I kinda think I know. I had a daughter who disappeared. Doug Ozinga doesn't exist. And I found a dead body in the woods.

 Part 3 doesn't complete the novel, there are still 12-13 chapters left. Does anyone know where the rest of it is? 




 I climb out of my car and survey the intimate piece of wooded glen before me. It's quiet here, and cold. I have come to this secret, isolated place everyday for the past week. It used to be Our Spot, but now, it is only Aiden's.

I sit on the grass and I stare at his tree and I feel the chilled, thin air whip the hot tears from my cheeks. I shake my head to try and clear it as the familiar questions bleed into my mouth, begging to be asked. How could he have done this? What drove him to it? Why didn't I see the signs? Is it my fault? I bury my head in my hands, partly for warmth, partly in despair. We were happy once, we were in love. This was Our Spot. And now when I look at Aiden's tree, all I see is death. And so I'll sit and contemplate our short time together and try to reconcile it all as I have done everyday since it happened.

**3 months ago**

*I don't remember a time that I didn't love him. We went to preschool together and I watched him from afar. Our parents weren't friends or neighbors, we just happened to live in the same school district. I spent a decade loving him in silence. In high school, he joined a band and was well-liked. He was cool without even trying, one of those types. I was the shadow in the hallway, the unregistered blip on the lunchroom radar. I was something to step around, just a dismissive object out of the corner of their eyes. But, I had my own friends and they were as diffident as I was.* 

*The first words I ever said to him were: "Thanks, you don't have to do that if you don't want to, even though you offered to."* 

*Stupid words. Asinine words. The words of a child. I had dragged my friends to a party and Aiden was there. We had never drank alcohol before but wanted to be accepted as one of their own, so we sipped on their wine coolers. Except Annie. Annie didn't sip, Annie got drunk. We tried to hold her up as best we could and Aiden saw our struggle. He wasn't drinking. He was so responsible, so mature. He offered to drive us home. I didn't have my car. We said yes.*

I watch the wind dance between the branches of Aiden's tree. The long, spindly boughs are barren and with nothing to catch the gales, they move only slightly, as if slow dancing with a lover. It doesn't remind me of us. Your tree is strong, but then, it had to be, didn't it? I wonder how long it takes a man to die, hanging from a tree. I pull my jacket around me tighter as if it were a safety blanket, but it can't protect me from the questions. Where were the red flags? What does it say about me that I missed them? That I missed all of them?

**2 months ago**

*Aiden called me and invited me to a horror movie. How did he even get my number? I suppose the way cool people get things that they have a mild interest in - passively and with minimal effort. We sat in the back of the theater. I tried to get my courage up to touch him, but I was failing. And then, at the first jump scare, I grabbed his arm, involuntarily. His hand immediately closed over mine and he held me there, smiling and stroking my fingers. Afterward we sat in his car and talked for hours. He was nothing like I'd thought. He was humble and creative and deep. And he showed me a smile I'd never seen on him before. I called it My Smile, because it was only ever for me.*

*I wanted to hide that we were dating from the school but Aiden didn't care, he wanted the world to know. After two weeks I met his parents and he met mine. He drove me to Our Spot after a party and kissed me for the first time. His lips tasted like cool mint. Our Spot...it had been my favorite place to go, in real life and in my dreams. It had been beautiful and warm, the magic of our young love reflected in a twinkling canopy of stars and shimmering, red autumn leaves*.


But now it was just a grotesque pile of dirt and dead grass upon the skin of Mother Earth. The trees, once whimsical and droll, now looked like sharp, unwelcome daggers jutting intrusively out of the tender, hallowed ground. It looked like it hurt. If I could, I would tear the trees from her body and fill in the holes with soothing, white snow. Oh Aiden, I need to know why you did it! Why did it have to end? What drove you to such extremes?

Did he do it because of me? Or had it been buried deep within him all along?

I stare at Aiden's tree, willing it to give me the answers I crave, but the tree is silent and lovely, masquerading as an innocent, peaceful life. But I know it's not. It has played it's part.

I loved you, Aiden. I told you so under this tree, and you told me, too. We were stronger than the demons, together, I know we were. How could someone like you, so loving, so creative, so beautiful wind up here - hanging from an ugly Sugar Maple, your body as empty as it's crisp, black branches? I had been so blind. To him and to what was slowly happening around me.

**1 month ago**

*I can't put a finger on exactly when it started or why. It's like trying to remember the precise moment you fell asleep upon waking the next day. The details are hazy and blurred, it seemed to happen over time and yet all at once. He still winks at me, he hugs me. We go places together and we kiss. But the smile he reserved only for me seems to have disappeared from his stock of facial expressions. I don't realize then that I'll never get to My Smile again.*

*After a week, I begin to wonder if he is falling out of love with me. So I offer him the only thing a girl like me has to offer someone like that. My innocence. Aiden smiles gently and asks if that's what I really want. I tell him yes. I know that the night will be painful and beautiful and that I will blossom into something different and lovelier by the morning. He considers for awhile and then strokes my hair and tells me he wants nothing more. He promises not to hurt me. He promises not to touch me if I don't feel right about it when the time comes. He keeps his promise. We choose a night after a party to drive to Our Spot. I am happy again, for a short time.*


The light in the sky is growing dimmer, now. Colors begin to bleed into the horizon and I know I must go soon. The wind has left Our Spot and the air, though thin and cold, is somehow stagnant. Had Aiden's last breath of air been like this: stale and decaying? Or had it smelled beautiful as Our Spot once had, like fresh pine and starlight?  I would find no honest answers here. Only lies or silence.

***7 days ago***

*I find it cruel, whether intentional or careless, that Aiden bought the rope while I was with him. I met him at the Home Depot where he worked and he said he had to buy something after he got off the clock. He said it like it meant nothing at all. It was a long, white rope, just an innocuous weaving of fibers, selected unceremoniously from a red bucket of ropes. How could such a plain, ordinary thing take away something so precious to me? How could it dare? It was nothing, just a bland, boring and common coil of rope- limp and lifeless. It had millions of brothers and sisters in the world just like it.  It just doesn't seem fair, like it assumed too much of itself, to take something so important away. I wonder where the rope is now.*

*We went to the party, my last party with the man I loved. Unlike Aiden's sudden, yet somehow gradual change I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew something was wrong that night. Aiden stood across the room from me, whispering with strangers and staring. It was an odd gaze. He didn't try to hide his stare yet somehow still seemed ashamed of it. I began to feel sick then. It was my first and only red flag. I finally had a sign that something terrible was going to happen. But it was too late then.*

*I remember more than I wish to. Aiden noticed my state and helped me stumble to a bedroom. Four men followed him in. Aiden was true to his word, and never touched me. Perhaps there is comfort in that. A different man tied me with the familiar, course rope. It hurt my wrists. Funny thing that it is that pain I concentrated on more than any other.*  

*The man I loved stood in the corner and watched it all. He smiled and laughed with them as the men did the disgusting things they did. Through the mist I could see them and I tried to remember every detail but halfway through it all my brain shut off as if there were a sudden power outage in my body. And the things they did in the dark...* 

*When I awoke I was laying on the floor in a darkened room. The rope, like the very core of myself, had turned from snow white to a hot, unfamiliar red.* 

*I didn't get to take Aiden to the Home Depot but that's okay, I bought the things I needed with his store discount anyway. Then, I convinced him to get in my car. Then I convinced him to drink a Mountain Dew. Then I drove him to Our Spot and penetrated him four times with four ordinary, common nails I had chosen at random from an ordinary, common black bucket. I found out that day that I enjoy poetic justice. Once he was stuck to the tree I sat down in front of it and watching him writhe for awhile. I thought he would be dead by the next day. But he wasn't.*

I get up now and walk across the glen. Our Spot has changed as I have changed. Where I had once been clean and white and pure, I was now dirty and red and noisy. The glen had once been lively and busy with red-orange leaves dripping with so many promises. But now it was white and quiet and dead. The glen and I had stolen from each other, swapped our souls in the dead of night. 

I step up to Aiden's tree. His wounds are no longer bleeding which disappoints me because I am still bleeding. It has been five days. Pieces of his feet are missing and chucks of flesh from his face and thighs, just as chunks of me are missing inside. We are inside-out mirrors of each other and this calms me.

Aiden hasn't moved since I've been here. It seems that the elements and dehydration have finally killed him. I give a satisfied smile. I call it Aiden's Smile. I pull off an orange glove and place my hand against the thin, waxy skin of his face. He opens his eyes just a fraction and parts his cracked lips to speak. He makes no sound as there is only ash in his throat where his promises were cremated. I frown and sigh in disappointment as I prepare to make the drive home. I had hoped this would be the last I'd see of Aiden's Spot. I guess I'll come back tomorrow.
