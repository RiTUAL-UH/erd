 Science AMAs are posted early to give readers a chance to ask questions and vote on the questions of others before the AMA starts. 

Guests of /r/science have volunteered to answer questions; please treat them with due respect. Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.

If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.  Instructions for obtaining flair are here: [reddit Science Flair Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair) (Flair is automatically synced with /r/EverythingScience as well.)

 Even worse, some big name highly competitive chemists (I think it was Corey) would completely leave out critical steps in their procedures so that their competition *couldn't* reproduce it.

Shameful it is.  




 Chiropractary has never had any proof it belongs in medicine, as a field chiropractors reject evidence-based methodology, huge difference. 




 In fairness, so does literally every other field of science, chemistry is struggling with the issue of reproducibility, as is biology and medical science.  The issue is reproducing others work isn't publishable, and if you aren't publishing in academia you are failing.

 Today we announce a new feature in /r/science, **Science Discussions**.  These are text posts made by verified users about issues relevant to the scientific community.  

The basic idea is that our practicing scientists will post a text post describing an issue or topic to open a discussion with /r/science.  Users may then post comments to enter the conversation, either to add information or ask a question to better understand the issue, which may be new to them.  Knowledgeable users may chime in to add more depth of information, or a different point of view.  

This is, however, not a place for political grandstanding or flame wars, so the discussion will be moderated, **be on your best behavior**.  If you can't disagree without being disagreeable, it's best to not comment at all.

That being said, we hope you enjoy quality discussions lead by experience scientists about science-related issues of the day.

Thanks for reading /r/science, and happy redditing!

 




 ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even on occasion music.  It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!
 
























 Starting on April 22nd, PLOS and /r/science will begin a weekly AMA series as part of the Science AMA Series to bring authors from the PLOS journals to reddit.

[See the announcement from PLOS here](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/)

PLOS, an open access journal, and /r/science, which does public review of journal articles, makes for a great fit, one that we are excited to bring to our readers.  

If you have suggestions or requests for AMAs from PLOS authors, email them to plosreddit@plos.org

Tune in every Wednesday for a new PLOS AMA!

 




 I've been trying to zone in on the fix for months, but I haven't had the time to really find the root cause. It's not the .organic-listing css, it's probably some inherited css from a different part of the stylesheet. 

I'm sure it's obvious to one of you, help?

 First off, I don't think this can be done, but I'd very much like to be wrong.

We in /r/science would like to track the number of readers who look at our AMAs, we get a lot of requests for the information and right now I have to email the admins and wait for them to get back to me with a number, I can't look at changes over time, or any other handy stats to let us know how people are using our AMAs. 

If we could embed a smart pixel via CSS we could gather some data on this, but it appears that all of the images that the subreddit CSS pulls need to be hosted on a reddit server, which would make our tracking pixel just a pixel.

Any thoughts on how to do this or am I stuck continually harassing people to get data?

 







































 Please don't submit them either, we are committed to keeping /r/science a serious discussion of science.  We know reddit just loves a good prank, but there are many other places to do so.

Yes, we totally hate fun.
