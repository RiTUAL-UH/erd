 Can't recall if Robocop has a beginning title screen, but it has an awesome end title screen 




 Jerry Maguire...actually ANYTHING from Cameron Crowe.  




 The Killing- Such a great late noir/heist movie and with so many great actors. Sterling Hayden scares me with his delivery of lines and his cold, stone face.
