 It could be uncontrolled diabetes. Two men that I worked with died of it relatively recently and one guy was actually talked about as being on the road to "eating himself to death." 




 Thanks.  




 "Seem" is the operative word. I've definitely had pimples come out during the day. You just tend not to notice the difference in your face from one hour to the next, but a break of eight hours makes it pretty obvious when you've got a new spot. 




 Do you know if they're actual paintings or Photoshopped?  




 Thanks. 




 This is best of? Seriously?

Most people are craven sheeple and it's not remotely surprising that when somebody in power tells them to jump, they ask how high. It's a lot harder to figure out why some people act truly selflessly, putting themselves at risk in order to help or save others. 

When somebody explains that, that'll be worth a best of. 




 I thought that was his mother. 




  A Discovery of Witches

I was considering reading that series. Skip it, then? 




 Which books? Titles? 




 Because they want to live on the Upper West Side the same way that you apparently do. And the UWS is not even one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan either, especially once you get out of the Lincoln Center area. 




 Don't take cabs.  




 Yeah. I don't remember doing homework ever, though there must have been. 

I also didn't get particularly good grades, especially in high school. Seems to me that doing homework helps build a work ethic and keeps kids from coasting on their intelligence.  




 Recently finished Whatever by Michel Houellebecq. It had an unnamed narrator, but it was a really short book so it didn't matter. Too bad it wasn't as good as it could have been.

The beginning was an absolutely vicious skewering of office life and office workers. The middle had a touch of American Psycho to it. But then the end just petered out into nothingness. Perhaps that was part of the point, but it had more of the feeling that Houellebecq just didn't know how to sustain the story.  




 Have you read his other early books The Chocolate War, I Am the Cheese, After the First Death, and The Bumblebee Flies Anyway? They are so good and so disturbing. His later books were weaker.

Some other YA authors who don't get any love here: Ron Koertge, Pete Hautman, Kathe Koja, and Paul Zindel. 




 But seriously, some card issuers do now offer one-time-use codes, and those are secure.

Good one, I never heard of it. I wonder if my CC has this option. 




 WAT. Also: WAT.

This seems like a fantastically bad idea all around. 




 Then how do you use it? 




 Yup, Kingkiller Chronicle.

Not fantasy/SF, but the romance in the latest John Rain book Graveyard of Memories by Barry Eisler had a whiff of "have you ever even talked to a girl?" about it, except that Eisler is married, so clearly the inability to write a decent romance is not necessarily about a lack of personal experience. 









 Because they have a sexy accent and you don't. 




 It goes way back to the belief that the Jews killed Jesus, way before Jews were moneylenders. 




 I have blue tissues in my bedroom right now. 




 Some of them are counterfeit, some of them are refurbished but don't tell you that, some of them are older/discontinued models, some of them were originally purchased with stolen credits cards so it didn't cost the seller anything to buy... so many possible reasons. 




 No. Just go to Europe where men regularly sit with their legs together and crossed at the knee, not at the ankle. This is entirely cultural, not physical. 




 It's supposed to be the ten sons of Haman from the Purim story as mentioned below. 




 A freilichin Purim!

 This is absolutely incorrect. 

Not the mention that living conditions in Gaza are particularly bad because of Hamas, not because of Israel. In fact, Yasser Arafat's widow, Suha, sued Hamas, blaming them for the situation and for being unwilling to give up violence and negotiate with Israel. 




 I don't know what you're wearing or where you're shopping but plenty of my clothes have the label on the side toward the bottom.  




 Nobody knows. If they did, breast cancer testing wouldn't be as controversial as it is. When they pushed early detection they found more and more cancers but it didn't seem to save a commensurate amount of lives. Why? Because it turns out that a significant number of these cancers would have resolved themselves on their own and had they not been found through testing, nobody would have been the wiser. So instead we save a few more lives, but put a lot of women through hell for nothing.

Problem is, nobody knows once a tumor is found whether it will resolve itself or not so the thinking see-saws between earlier testing and later testing. 




 This is seriously untrue. In some countries women are killed for saying they were raped. In some they're not allowed to drive. Or go outside without being escorted. Or go outside without being covered from head to toe. Forced into marriage in their teens. Have no right of divorce. 

Palestinians are not remotely treated anything like this.  




 Wikipedia's source actually says there were up to 6,500 Danish Jews and 1,300 of their non-Jewish children through mixed marriage. Of these 7,800 people, 580 didn't escape and 464 of them were sent to Theresienstadt.

Though other sources do give other similar, but not exactly the same numbers.
 




 OP's article says there were 7,800 Danish Jews, so clearly the number hasn't been pinned down exactly, but it's certainly below 10,000.

ETA: See below. 




 It's really disgusting that OP's grandma wrote a sweet and lovely card and grampa gets props for basically signing his name.  




 I think I misunderstood your comment earlier, and possibly other people did too. Upvoted now, for what it's worth. 




 First, there were very few Jews in Denmark, about 6,000, compared to about 140,000 in Holland, and more than 3 million in Poland. Most of them were so assimilated as to be indistinguishable from other Danes. 

http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/countrymen-untold-story-denmark-jews-escaped-nazis-bo-lidegaard-review 




 There is an old Kabbalistic belief that at any given time, 14,400 Righteous Among the Nations (Gentiles who are willing to help Jews).

I don't know where you got this number or definition from. There's a concept that there are 36 righteous people among the nations in every generation and they "sustain the world." It has nothing to do with helping Jews.

There's another concept that any non-Jew living in (ancient) Israel and was pious was called "righteous among the nations."

And finally, the phrase "Righteous Among the Nations" is what Yad Vashem calls non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust. It's not kabbalistic, it's just a slogan that they appropriated because it sounds good. 




 What it really means is that Danish Jews were so assimilated that they were barely identifiable as Jews anymore. So while what the Danes did was a good thing, if the Jews had been less assimilated, they might not have done it.  




 If you live at home, you have to move out immediately, if not sooner. If not, then you simply have to stop talking to your mom about men and realize that she cannot prohibit you from doing anything because you are an adult. 

She sounds like a very bitter, very unhappy woman. She has no right to take out her regrets about her life on you. 




 This is what the Save option is for. 




 A few men

And women. Ada Lovelace is considered the world's first computer programmer. 




 Normally I downvote all "should I read the book or watch the movie first" questions because the answer is almost always "watch the movie first so that you're not disappointed if it doesn't live up to the book" but I'm upvoting this because funnily, I have that movie out from the library right now myself and I totally forgot that it was based on a book. So, upvote for reminding me. 




 I kept reading the title as a "man-mouse utopia."  




 On the way home tonight a car was backing into a parking space and a pigeon was slowly walking out of the way. I was really scared for it. Thankfully it turned out okay but I'm always worried when I see pigeons too close to moving cars.

 I recently read Broken Monsters. There was a slight bit of horror/sadness. I didn't think it was too extreme, but you sound like a more sensitive person than me.

It's a great book for anyone who liked True Detective.

 At first I thought Quantico sounded interesting, then it sounded like a rip-off of The Recruit. 









 You're right, but at the same time I don't disagree that my writing lacks heart. I think it's a valid criticism.  




 Maybe I'm not writing with a burning passion but I don't think most professional writers are. They always say that you're not supposed to wait for inspiration, you're supposed to set a schedule and stick to it.

I can't do both. I can write in an inspired way but inspiration isn't going to sustain a novel-length work. Or I can write a novel methodically and apparently not have any heart. 




 I don't think the Martian had any heart at all and I couldn't have cared less about about any of it but it wasn't boring, so I kept reading. But most people seemed to have loved it. 




 I read On Writing a long time ago. Seems like it's time to read it again. 




 I'm looking at m-w.com now and I don't see that definition. Could you link it? 




 Even 95% heart and 5% head can work.

Sure, but now it's the opposite way around.

Of course it's a metaphor but the idea is that I'm intellectualizing too much. And the person who said this wasn't wrong at all in her assessment.

You know who writes like this a lot? Orson Scott Card. Occasionally Brandon Sanderson does too. 




 That's advice someone gave me recently. Has anybody else ever gotten this advice? How did you deal with it?

I'm not sure this is something I'm capable of doing. Maybe I should consider changing genres to something like SF where writing from your head is prized (I'm thinking of books like The Martian). The problem is that I don't read SF too much anymore and have no story ideas for it.  




 Hm? I wouldn't recommend calling a woman "sir." 




 How do customers refer to the men? As "Mr."? Then yes, a woman should be referred to as "Miss." 




 More likely it works on people who are not depressed at all, but are simply lazy and don't know how to motivate themselves.

 If the house is up to code, then I'm 100% right.

Why do you have any reason to believe the house is up to code? Again, you have never seen this house, have no idea what condition it's in. To tell somebody that something is okay without having examined it yourself is the height of irresponsibility. 




 Most 

Most is not all. 

That electrician saw this house and you didn't. You're the moron. 




 That's not safe. You're not supposed to use space heaters with extension cords.

http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters

As I said below, I know somebody whose house burned down from an electrical fire so I don't think this is something to take lightly. 




 I really don't understand why you're arguing. I'm sorry this is not something you're familiar with, but this is a matter of safety for yourself, your family and anybody who might be living with you or in your building. It's not something to be defensive about because you've never heard of it.

Do not overload circuits. Never use extension cords or multiple plugs with a space heater, and make sure the unit is not plugged into the same circuit as other electric appliances.

If your space heater is plugged into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) and the GFCI trips, dont assume there is something wrong with the GFCI. Immediately stop using the 
heater until it can be checked by a professional if not, a serious shock could occur.

http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters

During use, check frequently to determine if the heater plug or cord, wall outlet, or faceplate is HOT! If the plug,
outlet, or faceplate is hot, discontinue use of the heater, and have a qualified electrician check and/or replace the plug or faulty wall outlet(s). If the cord is hot, disconnect the heater, and have it inspected/repaired by an authorized repair person.

 You cannot Google what's inside your house. I have a friend whose house burned down from an electrical fire. The "story" is not implausible at all. Space heaters are notorious. But you want to Google? I Googled. First result: Space heaters involved in 79 percent of fatal home heating fires.

http://www.nfpa.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/space-heaters-involved-in-79-percent-of-fatal-home-heating-fires 




 It's worth getting a professional opinion instead of risking burning down your house. 




 How could doctors be utilized? The government can regulate doctors but they can't give them money and tell them to give the money to patients who've lost weight.

 




 The government can control what businesses do. They cannot simply offer people money for weight loss -- there's no mechanism for it. 




  You can get out of the rut, if you just... do it.

 This is not a shoe advertisement. The trick, I'm now convinced, is to just go ahead and do it, whether you feel like it or not. Because you know what? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT.

 Pick something you've always wished you could do. 

That's great, but I have a friend who's depressed. There is nothing she's always wished she could do. She literally has no interests aside from reading and watching TV. 




 That's a good idea, but they have to be careful: My friend was told by an electrician that the outlet in her bathroom was not strong enough for a space heater.  




 So mark this thread Explained. 




 Because colors have cultural and personal associations so we gravitate toward colors that we feel have meaning for us. 




 While what the other comments say isn't wrong, this is a students' show and putting the craziest designs first is the equivalent of clickbait.

 I think in Europe they must use the word tower in a different way than we do in a America. That's not a tower, it's a building. The English definition of a tower is a tall structure that's taller than it is wide, usually by a lot. That flak tower is fairly short and squat. 




 A little late to this party but from searching, over in /r/books about four months ago a lot of people expressed this opinion, but more recently if you say you didn't like it you get crucified. 

I agree with everything you said except for the bit about Hugo Lamb. I didn't find any of it compelling. I basically had to force myself to read it, not because the writing was bad or boring per se but because there was literally no character that was of any interest or any storyline that I cared to find out how it was resolved.

The sum of my feelings is that it was a poorly-stitched Franken-novel.  




 I don't understand the "bus stops" data. There are a ton more bus stops than this showing. 




 And yet it has everything to do with it. The current scope and incarnation of Chareidi society wouldn't exist today if the Holocaust hadn't happened.

 It's by using new ingredients or in different combinations. While they will all get your hair equally clean, they will interact with different types of hair differently. It is more obvious if you have long hair than if you have short hair. So some will make your hair smoother while other will have an impact on the volume, for example.

 Have you ever been sexually assaulted? Honest question, not being a twat here.

I've been bullied and my biggest "win" came through words. And it took me a long time to get there because for too much of my life I was also given the advice to just ignore bullies. 

People sometimes think they will react in a certain way, and when the time comes, it somehow isn't how it goes.

This isn't a case of being cornered in a dark alley and feeling panicked. The girl had enough presence of mind to speak up the first time, she just needs the lesson reinforced that just because an authority figure says something doesn't mean they're always right and doesn't mean you have to listen.  




 Said to the teacher, "No, I cannot and will not ignore it and if you don't take appropriate action, I'm going to the principal's office to report both the student and you."

In other words, be assertive, not aggressive.

 I edited. It's not under 18, it's under 21. 

After years of snapping up credit cards with ease, the Credit CARD Act of 2009 will make it much more difficult for anyone under the age of 21 to qualify for a credit card.

Under the new law, which takes effect in February 2010, no one under the age of 21 will be approved for a credit card offer unless a parent or guardian or spouse is willing to co-sign, or the young adult shows proof of sufficient income to cover the credit obligation.

 The early books are excellent, the more recent books are not bad. 

Watched about 15 minutes of the TV show, didn't seem true to the books at all. But who knows, it might be a good show if you haven't read the books. 




 Most credit cards require a co-signer for anybody under ~~18~~ 21, so I don't understand how this is a problem. Don't co-sign for him.  




 Why do we get so upset at the "gawkers" that slow down to 10 mph to look at a fender bender and cause miles of creeping, but yet when we get to the accident we still slow down and check it out?

That's a classic case of hypocrisy. "Do as I say, not as I do." Either stop slowing down or stop complaining about other people doing it. 




 its all about personal experience during development

It's not. It's also to do with genetics. There are plenty of people who were abused as children and are still brave and/or thrill-seeking. In fact, sometimes people who were abused are more likely to be thrill-seekers than people who weren't. 




 For a heterosexual man in prsion, how can homosexual rape be a pleasurable substitution to masturbation?

The same way that sticking your dick in a pie or a fleshlight is. A hole is a hole. It doesn't particularly matter what it's attached to when you're desperate.

If it's to show dominance, what's wrong with just beating the crap out of the guy?

Because men are much more terrified of being raped than being beaten.

 Henry Cavill? Or that other guy that looks like Henry Cavill but is supposedly somebody else.  




 At least in academia it is absolutely possible to plagiarize yourself. I haven't seen it mentioned regarding fiction but that's probably because you're not going to sue yourself for plagiarism and neither will your audience.

But either way, like you said, reusing the same themes, characters, etc., is very common. Though if the author reuses them to extent that they run out of anything new to say about them, I consider that literary cannibalism.  




 I read a handful of books in 8th/9th grade that had a huge impact on me though I'm not sure I'd go so far as saying they changed my life. Haven't felt that way about a book since and I've long since graduated high school. 




 It's why in the past in China long fingernails were seen as a sign of nobility.

 Talk about yourself, your interests, your studies, your job, funny things your friends have said, books, movies, music, the weather, flowers, the Internet, clothing, pets, your family, exercise, diet, art, politics, religion............

I mean, there are a million and one things to talk about. But honestly, this is not a real relationship, so you shouldn't sweat it so much. I have an Internet friend of like 10 years already and we've never met and we don't talk very often, but he is somebody that I'm glad to "know" and I leave it on that level. 




 If his depression is specific to his job, you need to sit him down, figure out what the problem with his job is and how he can fix it, even if it means going to his boss or HR and asking for some kind of special accommodations. But if the job is just another symptom, then he is genuinely depressed and needs professional help. 




 Your grandmother sounds like she's very lonely. Maybe make an effort to spend some quality time with her every day (at your convenience, not hers) and then hopefully she'll back off with the comments.

 I'm a fan of the Five Love Languages theory. One of the ways of showing love is gift giving. But either you feel uncomfortable about receiving gifts for some reason or it's simply not something that makes you feel loved. 

To a certain extent, this is an intractable problem. If the two of you stay together, one of you has to change. If he does other things that make you feel loved, then I recommend it be you. Otherwise, it should be him because there's no sense in having a boyfriend who you don't feel loves you. 




 Valentine's Day has a historical foundation too. It wasn't "just sort of created" any more than Christmas was. You get Christians saying that Christmas has been become too commodified, so they can try to "take back" Valentine's Day if they want, too.

 And women did physical work like cooking, sewing and child rearing, where long hair and nails also get in the way, so this doesn't work at all as an explanation.  




 Not only the apostles. There were lots of followers that don't get any kind of NT mention. Jewish-Christians were integrated into Jewish society and there were litmus tests to see if people had adopted Christian beliefs. 




 That's later on. The Romans and whatnot weren't the original Christians.
