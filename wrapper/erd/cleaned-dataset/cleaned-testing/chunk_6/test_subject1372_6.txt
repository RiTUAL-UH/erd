 I actually agree with this guy somewhat about the cards he says is bad. The build he posted is pretty good. But it would need some updating since that deck was pretty much built for a year ago. 




 Cyber Dragon Zwei sucks. You don't need it. 3 CD, 3 Core, and 3 drei is all I've ever needed as Cyber Dragons go. So remove the Zweis, the Jinzos, and whatever that last monster is at the end. You just don't need them. 




 Remind me again where I can get a build with Ridley added in! 




 If we never listened to music, we'd probably never have volume levels dawg.

 "Introducing Tyler Perry's..." *rips up paper* "Let's be honest. It doesn't matter what we put here. It's gonna suck." 




 If it was a dragon, then it'd be easy to integrate. But one deck having better use for red-eyes because it's a dragon type doesn't automatically mean red-eyes would be an inherently worse card. In fact, Dragon Rulers with Red-eyes would be even worse than a dragon-ruler deck without red-eyes. You know, when you're actually building it with the purpose of trying to build the strongest deck possible.

Quite frankly, your point is invalid since Dragon Rulers wouldn't want red-eyes in their deck anyway. 




  The whole reason I didn't get MM3D is because my N64 copy still works fine

So does mine. But I still got MM3D. The new game is amazing. The bosses were revamped, there are two new fishing holes, and a few items were changed around. Also, there are 7 bottles, improved design choices, and more often than not, we got what is in the Japanese N64 version instead of the USA N64 version. 




 Because Evolve claimed to be so much more than it was, costs $60 to play a game developed for freemium format, and has over $200 in DLC AFTER you buy the game. 




 I probably would. There would probably be a lot of decks that would benefit from something like this. Plus, it would obsolete all normal monsters with 5 or more stars with less than that much attack. I.E. Red-eyes Black Dragon.

 Will this work with off-brand adapters in the near future? 




 So... if this was able to support the off-brand 3rd party ones, the ones that try to look like the official one, that would be great. I tried just to see if it would work with my girlfriend's adapter. (Her parents did the buying, which was a stupid decision since they don't have a fucking clue when it comes to electronics.) 




 Said the person resorting to insults.

I'd really like to see anybody here complaining about the size make the same OS with all the same 1:1 features and have it be significantly smaller than what iOS right now. Really, if they can do it, go ahead. I know I can't do it, but if I really wanted to complain, it would be to Apple's feedback page, not to strangers on a place where insulting me gets you nowhere, points don't matter, and nothing productive gets done.

iOS 9 is rumored to be a stability and slimming down of the operating system, so let's hope that's true. If the code really is sloppy, maybe a huge stability update will deal with it.

In the mean time, you can stop trying to prove that you're intelligent to people don't fucking know or care about you. 




 I wouldn't say this set is that good. It's mostly fox doing the same old same old fox stuff on a Lucario that sort of gets a decent string every now and then. (I'll admit, better strings than I could pull off on Lucario, but not the best strings I've seen.)

Very last game was a bit intense, but outside of that, nothing I found too extraordinary. 




 Might want to work on the UI. Maybe it makes sense when you touch things and get the hang of things, but right now, just at a glimpse, it doesn't make sense.

The one I'm using right now on iOS, [MLP CCG Assistant](http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/dd/be/e7/ddbee787-03d0-db4a-6fb2-0a3d28d992a2/screen406x722.jpeg) takes care of both players. It's clear, it's concise, and there was no confusion in learning how to use it. And starting a turn even gives the turn player the proper amount of AT depending on the winning player's score. 




 "Honey, please, I'm in the middle of teaching Sex Ed." 




 Combine a lot of megabytes, you get a gigabyte. That's kind of how it works. There's a virtually uncountable list of features in a lot of these operating systems. We're getting to the point that anything you can do on a computer, you can do on your phone. So why do we expect the OS to be smaller just because it's on a smaller form factor? That's completely absurd.

And operating system is an operating system. And they are all just tools to move files and manage/use applications. In that respect, Windows and OS X are just the same with different skins. Well, each with their own unique file handling/productivity enhancing features, but that's beside the point. So how do you assume I don't know shit if I'm comparing operating systems? Check the fucking mirror. 




 Long story short: My girlfriend attempted suicide. I found a cipher online that convinced me I could reach her by posting my message publicly and having someone decipher it. I attempt suicide shortly after. My sister goes through something similar. We land on the local small town news. Other suicides around town follow shortly after. I go to console one of the families and see the cipher in a painting on the wall. I want to take it away, but the deceased's mother wanted to keep it because it was the last painting he did.

So now I'm here, writing what will be my final warning to you.

The mother that held on to her sons painting posted on one of her social media accounts yesterday. She committed suicide shortly after. This is what her post contained.

 Nz Tup, O'n dunoph vu tii zua.

 Vjiz xupv cimoiwi ni, cav O lpux Omm tii zua. atv ci qevoipv. Zuas qeopvoph nelit ni nott zua nusi epf nusi. Xjev ot ov Ovt tu cieavogam. Omm etl zua eheop xjip O hiv vjisi.

 Tov vohjv txiivjiesv.

I put it through a reverse cipher thanks to a few online tools. Here is what it actually said.

 My Son, I'm coming to see you.

 They wont believe me, but I know Ill see you. Just be patient. Your painting makes me miss you more and more. What is it? Its so beautiful. Ill ask you again when I get there.

 Sit tight sweetheart.

When I visited the house, I passed myself off as family just to see the inside. An investigator told me that she had bashed her own head against the painting her son had made. When a shard flew off, she picked it up and jammed it in her throat.

No sign of forced entry or struggle. A suicide by anybody's analysis. I couldn't believe it. But, I fucking knew it. This is how suicide spreads. A fucking demon gets into our head and makes us believe that we can reach that person again. It's a siren's song.

Dont seek the suicide cipher. 




 Guys, there are rich bastards out there already spending this amount of money on watches and jewelry that don't do anything.

You don't have to spend 10k on it. You don't have to buy it at all. But if you really want one, they'll be as low as $350. So really, people, stop losing your shit over something you don't actually care about. 




 Because there are apps included with the OS and features that become universal such as copy/paste, typing, highlighting, showing the time and status bar. That's like asking why is OSX or Windows 7 so huge when it's just a finder to get to applications. 




 I suppose there should also be lawsuits about storage devices promising a certain amount, and you figure out that what you got is actually only 98% of the advertised amount.

No, really. I'm tired of people complaining that their 8 GB drive doesn't hold their 7.5 GB file because there's actually only 6.9 GB on the drive. My 500 GB hard drive doesn't even have 500GB. It's actually around 490 GB. It's frustrating.

In case these companies haven't heard, a Gigabyte is 1024 Megabytes, not 1000. 




 I do agree that active members alone won't solve any problems by itself. It does take a step in the right direction with the right kind of activity. We could have 1,000 members posting here every day, but if only 1 is submitting good content, and nobody is voting on what's good and what's bad, we're just going to continue getting swarms of bad content. This place becomes a mine field with the occasional treasure that takes too much effort to search for.

I personally like your idea of getting the posters involved in submitting vines they make and using this place to promote their page. Why isn't this a real thing yet?

Submit your ideas in a mod message, and we'll start discussing them.

Thank you.

 Hazy Problem Fixer

Spell Card

 This card cannot be destroyed, banished or removed from the field by any other card's effect. On your opponent's 3rd end phase after this card was activated, send this card to the Graveyard. Once per turn; you can Special Summon 1 "Hazy Flame" monster from your deck. If there is a "Hazy Flame" monster in your graveyard during your draw phase, you can add it to your hand in addition to your normal draw.

Hazy Flame monsters take way too much to get their power plays which can be stopped or undone quickly, so they need to be able to regenerate advantage, make plays without using too many hand resources, and they need to be able to get cards out on the field. Not to mention, it sucks that Hazy Pillar is stupid weak to removal making Hazy Flames weak to that.

 This post was removed since it wasn't a vine or a youtube compilation of vines.

* Vines are 6 seconds or less.
* The content was far longer than 6 seconds
* The content was not compilations of 6 second videos 




 The mods here have been disappointed in the lack of voting in this subreddit. This sub has more than 10,000 subscribers. Almost 11,000. Vine is a very popular trend right now even with its changing nature and that it's two year run already settling its place in social media.

The fact is, some of out top posts aren't even garnering the amount of upvotes that some subreddits get with fewer subscribers. Far fewer subscribers. Let me give you some examples.

[Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/vine/comments/2y4qi6/7_days_in_6_seconds/): This is a very well made vine. Not to mention a perfect loop which is a difficult trick in vine. This is the kind of think I would give a like. Maybe not revine since I only revine specific vines, but that's beside the point.

18 points, 83% upvotes. That means there's at most 22 votes on it.

[Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/vine/comments/2y2com/checking_your_bank_statement_after_a_night_out/): This vine has a theme that does rely on reading the caption or description, but luckily that is put into the vine itself instead of assuming you would read it. This makes it good to put in compilations since youtube compilations rarely put the information of a vine. Definitely something I find funny and gave an upvote. But...

25 points, 80% upvotes. That means there's at most 31 votes on it.

This is pitiful. Are there really less than 40 users here willing to upvote and downvote? Don't be afraid to downvote things you don't find entertaining. Or things that are just distasteful. We're not telling you to upvote everything. But with 10,868 (at the time I'm writing this) readers, we should be able to get a few hundred votes on each one. But we're averaging less than .003% of our userbase actively participating.

Things you should upvote:

* Vines you like
* Vines with themes you want to see more of
* Vines that are funny
* Vines with creativity
* Vines that show talent
* Good YouTube compilations
* Text posts about vine or asking for help

Things you should downvote:

* Vines that aren't funny, creative or show off talent
* Vines that are offensive or distasteful
* Troll vines
* NSFW vines
* YouTube posts that don't credit viners
* Things that aren't vine

DO NOT...

* Downvote Youtube compilations unless they are poor or don't give credit
* Downvote vines just because you don't like the user
* Mass downvote every post just to troll

Please be more active. We could make this a great and fun subreddit to visit. And we wouldn't mind getting some of these posts on the front page. We're not expecting you to make us a default sub. As cool as that would be, that's a bit too much pressure and really only goes to top quality subreddits. We aren't there yet. We're nowhere near being on the same level of many other subreddits.

So if we just all make a habit of visiting /r/vine and upvoting a few posts that we like and downvoting a few that we don't, we can improve the quality of our posts and userbase. Once a week, it's easy, and it takes only a few minutes and you'll find content more enjoyable as you go along. After all, that would mean you're actually voting on the content. 




 They go to download then they're done. Torrents are p2p, aren't they? Why would they need to go through a server?

 How many STDs did I get from my cheating ex-girlfriend?... Oh, shit! 




 [Here's a link to what I previously talked about](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2xp7fc/survivors_guilt/)

Like I said, more suicide attempts started surfacing in my town after my sister and I both had attempted. In such a small town, it was big news. But I wasn't prepared for this. Remember that cipher I found that made me think I could reach my ex-girlfriend? In case you don't, you can [read about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/). In other words, we'll get to that.

I looked at the house of one of the families. After my sister and I attempted suicide, three successful suicides happened nearby. Almost too spooky to be coincidence. Government has called to tell news stations to stop broadcasting. They think its encouraging suicides.

But, I know suicide is not a way to get attention. What good is attention when youre dead? Seek help, dont seek the cipher.

I found a cipher to try to talk to my ex-girlfriend who had killed herself after three weeks of our long-distance relationship. After I stopped thinking about suicide, I couldnt see the cipher anymore.

On the wall of one of the houses, though, the cipher hung from a frame. The parents of the deceased put it on the wall as a memorial. He was a painter, apparently. Something I would have never known if none of this had happened. I asked if I could see it. I wanted to sneak it away from them so they wouldnt look at it. They kept such a close eye on it since it was the last painting the deceased had painted.

Maybe it wont have adverse effects though. There's no instructions, and it looked like it was painted from memory. It was barely close enough to be recognizable.

Im stuck just waiting and hoping that nothing happens. Regardless, I'm continuing my therapy. These posts and my therapy talks help me take that wreched image away from my consciene. 




 "Alright, PUSH Mrs. Johnson." 




 I love watching both HC and Markiplier. Mark's very funny and has fun commentary more often than not. And it's mesmerizing to see HC simply not give a fuck. Seriously, he may jump or pull back every now and then (and that's *not* a joke for the internet to enjoy), but this guy just doesn't get scared. 




 So was I. But then something completely different showed up at my door. 




 He is just one guy who makes the games in a matter of months. While we may think of a while as a few months in the game industry as we're used to waiting years between certain games, He's able to write out a new scenario, new mechanics, and work them out in a matter of months. So he may have taken a few weeks out of his life to chill. But since he has the basics of the engine down, he can make it much faster than it took him to make the first one. 




 This game definitely requires a bit of luck on top of knowing what you're doing. And figuring out what you're doing is difficult. I'm still having trouble getting past night 3.

 I cant warn you enough that if you do feel the need or desire to end your life, stay away from those thoughts. Surround yourself by those around you. They definitely care. And if you fail an attempt at suicide like my sister or me, you would probably know that you never feel more loved until after youve accepted that youre still alive.

My theraputic rant aside, there seems to have been three suicides in neighboring cities.  In this context, you're likely going to think I'm crazy, but I'm considering everything I've been through. 

* *[First Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/)*
* *[Second Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/)*
* *[Third Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2w37oa/i_made_the_news/)*
* *[Forth Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2wkgih/my_little_sister_is_in_the_hospital/)*

The shorter version is that I had a girlfriend who committed suicide. I put a ciphered message to her online hoping to get the message to her in purgatory. Thoughts of the cipher drove me to thinking I could be with her again if I committed suicide. My sister went through the same thing with one of her closest friends and attempted suicide shortly after I did. The pandemic is making the news. There are have been more suicides.

Theyre not releasing any names or locations, but I wanted to let people know that now is the time to let everyone know that you love them. 

Im hoping the suicides and attempts stop. I feel responsible. Since I made the local news and got so much attention, it has probably put the idea into a lot of others heads. They all have one other thing in common: these people supposedly all lost someone to suicide in recent days. The news has been calling me asking me to speek out, but Im not sure if that would yeild any success. I might anyway since Im already speaking out against it here.

I am going to visit the families over the weekend. Or maybe just in the next few days. Its not final, but I hope to find something that shows that it wasnt me. Hopefully, the investigators didnt take away absolutely everything.

Wish me luck. Oh, who am I kidding? What am I possibly going to find?

Nothing but guilt. 




 Wasn't aware I was down voted. People can hate all they want. Doesn't mean I'm wrong. 




 Figured this out long ago. I bet a lot of us did. Nevertheless, congratulations on that find. Not many people would find something like that on their own. A bit of an oversight by the dev team originally. But whatever. I guess it was there for those who were a bit smarter than others.

 To post something like that on something as public as vine or reddit is just distasteful.
