 I honestly don't know if I could make it through this game. I *barely* made it through amnesia and this looks 100 times more immersive! 




 Thanks for this! 




 Did you ever get any to drop? I'm afraid I'm too high level and no elite's ever spawn, so nothing ever drops. 









 How do you keep from getting too specific? 




 How many other people work in your css? 




 I like the idea of less abstract, general, presentational naming conventions.  Why does that work better for you? 




 How accurate is your aim? How much time is spent refactoring names like .tall_box into .front_page_call_to_action into .cta 




 Why would I want to display an old CTA that I'm replacing? 




 So in a case where content remains the same but the presentation to the user changes. 

How would your naming change if it was the presentation that remained the same but the content changed?

So for example:

On a portrait phone the container is 100% of the viewport's width and height and an image is displayed. 

On a landscape phone the same container is 100% of the viewport and a different image is displayed.  




 How do you keep your class names from getting too crazy in BEM? 




 What happens if the purpose changes? 




 Why are higher levels of abstraction better ("content" instead of "box" in your example)? 




 How important is semantics and why? 









 That's too bad :( Best of luck in whatever decision you make. Contract fun can be very rewarding! 









 If you do find yourself working in photoshop to create assets [check out Adobe's built in asset generator](http://blogs.adobe.com/photoshopdotcom/2013/09/introducing-adobe-generator-for-photoshop-cc.html). It saves your layers into files based on how you name the layers. It's a huge time saver. 




 I wish I could upvote you twice! 









 Oh no! Sorry about that. If you have time to post a screenshot I'll add it to my list of bugs. I wonder what it could be? 




 Do you have a link to this by chance? This sounds amazing. 




 Deal.  




 I've always thought it would be incredible to work with IDEO. Maybe it's time to consider relocating... 




 This is great, it works on mobile too! 




 Nicely done, you've inspired me. Thanks!

 Is the difference in pay the only thing that interests you about the new job? 














 I like using shadows for the [front face of buttons](http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/dPpvjo). 




 I had weird issues like that in a current project until I set the svgs as background images in the block elements' css.  




 Very rarely do I create the shapes in code. Usually I use Adobe illustrator and save the file as an SVG. Then you just open the SVG into your favorite text editor and tinker.  




 try [codepen](http://codepen.com) it's amazing and free. Best part is editing other people's work to learn new things.
