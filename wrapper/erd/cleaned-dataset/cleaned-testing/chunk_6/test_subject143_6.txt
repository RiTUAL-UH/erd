 I didn't down vote anything if that's what you're accusing me of? 




 Those fractal guides are really going to help me thank you! 




 Thanks this really helps I know an important part of he mesmerized in groups is reflects, thank you.  




 Thanks I'll go have a look. 




 That's an axe in his other hand, no idea who he is. 




 Thanks but I'm looking for more mesmer specific tips, not my first level 80 but thank you anyway :-) 




 Just hit 80 on my mesmer just looking for any general tips for dungeons, I've read the pve sticky on the gw2 forum, but any tips that are not well known that may help? 




 That makes it okay then she is registered with the NHS thank you I'll let her know today about it, yeah I've told her that myself, her mother especially though is very strict on these matters though, but like you said she wouldn't let her daughter suffer over it. 




 Yeah I know but neither of us have had any other sexual partners, so I'm not completely convinced either way STD or not she needs to get it checked and treated, just trying to find the right place to do that. 




 I didn't say it would be a bad idea just as she hasn't lived here long she doesn't have a personal doctor to go to, otherwise that would be our first option. 




 This does cost money though right as I checked the website it's pretty pricey, neither of us really have the money at the moment to be paying for treatments and tests and such, I'm going to have to try and convince her to see someone when she's home in Greece she's just scared of her parents knowing about it and would like to get tests and treatment before she leaves (Which I don't really think is possible given she's leaving Friday) but thank you for the suggestion, I will give it thought I don't want her problem to get worse because she's embarrassed. 




 I know that but i'm still confused by this, not sure how i can i apply this knowledge to work out how many more electrons than protons it has? 




 Thank you i found the equation for it earlier can't remember it off the top of my head 




 My girlfriend has found some small lumps on her vagina, she said it's itchy, and painful and she said it burns when she pees, not sure what it is, she's a student here in the UK and doesn't have a doctor to go to, also she's going back to Greece this friday, she wants to get checked as soon as possible, does anyone know where she can go to get this done for FREE? Really need your help reddit :-( She's in sheffield if that helps. (Not sure if this is the right sub for this direct me if i'm wrong)

Edit: Okay guys sorry i seem to have found a place we can go to, sorry to bother you /r/sex !

But just in case any suggestions would be nice as we will have to make an appointment and not sure when she will be able to get checked, do you guys know of any walk in centres? 




 also if anyone can help with this too If a heater uses 17kJ of energy in 5.2s, what power is it?  




 If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? Not sure how to work this one out. 




 Ah thank you so much the anwser is 2 it's simpler than i thought! 




 If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? I'm not sure how to go about working this out? Any help would be appreciated! Sorry if this seems easy to you guys.
