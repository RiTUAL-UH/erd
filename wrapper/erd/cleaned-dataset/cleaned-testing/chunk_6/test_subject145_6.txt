 Tamara, you should be proud. You saved a couple that would have likely drowned were it not for your courage. Not many others might have succeeded as you did in such a dangerous situation. Personally I think the couple should contact the Governor General to suggest you be nominated for an award. You certainly deserve it.

 Walking tripods. 




 You must have been a very good 31 year old. 




 OP...I'll take a wild guess... broke Asian college student? 




 A better table for sure. 




 Short answer: YES! 









 Lucky you...if that was lunch time, it would have been a totally different story.

 RIP to your dad OP.
