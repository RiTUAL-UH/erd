 It's whatever they feel like in any given situation. They're basically covering their asses as much as possible with these "regulations". 




 **PLEASE READ**

 nbsp;

Please don't give this game any more promotion. They are already trying to sell us exclusive DLC which gives paying players an edge in battle with extra weapons and equipment. We as a community have to stop promoting such bullshit practices by developers because if we don't no one will.

Thanks for your time. 




 That's gotta be fun at wartime. 




 Man, im glad I'm not that John Doe guy. He's always in all types of pickles. 









 Up the butt finger? 




 That's not a grappling hook. It's more of connectshittogether gun. 




 I don't know how many people I'mg goin to reply to on this thread but it does work.


Source: I plugged in my N64 a few days ago. After 30 mins of inserting the cartridge with nothing happen I blew on it. worked instantly. 




 Now you don't. I hooked up my N64 a few days ago and after about 30 mins of removing and inserting the cartridge I said "fuck it I'm I'm doing this old school" even though I read it was bad for game and console. Guess what, it worked instantly. It's like magic. 




 I got my N64 out a few days ago and was for a while trying to get to work. the only way it worked was after a good blowjob to the game and console. 




 It took me way too long to realise, I'm done for today. 




  ..no reason to praise them for something so small


A small gesture can go a long way, especially in today's money grabbing environment.  




 Their wrestling games were the best ever. These new ones reallyyyyyy suck. 




 Nah man you guys are missing out! The bananas is where it's at! 









 Wait, what? no split screen?? That's kind of killed the hype for me. My favourite part is completing the story with friends. Normally hook up 2 xbox's together so we can have half a screen each. 




 Strange old lady walks up to me and says "I don't like Michael, but don't tell him" then walked off. To this day Michael doesn't know.

 My past....deeep. 




 How I'm probably never going to find the one cause I'm too picky. No I'm not Ted Mosby. 




 He thinks about being human. 




 oooo tomorrow's not good for me, I got this thing I've been putting off for a good while now. 




 Cat 2: Meouch. 




 Apparently my boners are really impressive. Nearly every girl I've been with says "wow, big dick" or something of a sort. Happens 80% of the time, 100% of the time but still I don't believe them. Being a dude is complicated sometimes.

 




 Gets them every time! 




 I had a phone-call yesterday where I had to relay a code. One of the letters was F and my mind went blank, the only thing I could think of was Faggot. Thankfully the guy on the other line saved my ass and said "F for foxtrot?". That could've turned into one uncomfortable conversation. 














 I'm curios as to what type of work you do. I'm guessing something to do with stocks etc or?? 




 You make it sound like OP is the cause of all the problems.  




 You forgot to duplicate Crinfrid Reavers Dragon Hunter, good attempt though!


Edit: He is - Northern Realm Archer [5 points] can double attack power with a duplicate. 




 looks to me like the makings of a new death for 1000 ways to die. Why not find a window that's, I don't know, on the ground floor perhaps? 




 Not what you are asking but my most recent and surprising glitch was in Witcher 3. **SPOILERS AHEAD** It's when you are travelling through worlds with Avallach [Ciris elf friend, not sure how to pronounce his name] and come across the world with the deadly gas. If you manage to get down onto the lowest level [there are various ways of doing so] You can explore the world, there's nothing there but you can have a run around the ["titty mountains"](https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/screenshot/cd36820b-eed1-4b83-8067-3c73fe5d6465?gamertag=kiwi1990 scid=de360100-3ae5-4fd5-a7da-9d3d6b481c3d) as I like to call them.

 nbsp;

Also my favourite was in World at War where you could go under the map on that tank map and kill everyone from below whilst guarding the glitch entrance with claymores etc. 









 What button? 




 Yeah turns out I'm really dumb sometimes hence why I deleted the post. Also the diagrams were missing because I had the enhanced versions. Mondays can be roughh! 




 ikr what moron is paying $1000 dollars for 5 lines of code and a fancy skin?? Please let me know cause I have this amazing opportunity for him for the low, low price of $50,000. 




 Don't know why you are getting downvoted, you're on point IMO! 




 I don't want to work where you work. 




 This is just extremely good work, 10/10 on IMDB 




 That backflip though, hilarious. 




 And now I can't wait to get home to re-live this song for the first time in years!! 




 Call me AL!!! Man I wish I was alive in the 80's 




 Do other songs make you leak just salty tears instead of salty salty? 




 Go home mom. 




 Awesome, I now know a ton of people on a first name basis!! 




 France is the asshole of the world, where all assholes congregate.

 Thank you =) 




 His attitude is so infectious, I wish I could find the thing that brings me this much enjoyment and happiness. Happy lazing! 




 send picture in to work, take a day off. Doesn't look that bad to me! 




 For me it was an ex. 




 Nope, so far it seems non existent. Still have a few treasure quests to do so who knows! If I remember I'll post an update if I find anything. 




 Happened to me too!! Time I would roll dodge, Gerlat would mount his "trusty stead". 




 Wartime Rule No 257. Any hole is a goal. 




 There was something extremely alluring about him.
  




 What this guy said!!

 HAHA! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SEOR POOPY PANTS!!  




 ..and most don't have beards! 




 Yeah the main story line in Skellieg was a bit of a let down. I went over on way too high of a level, did a couple of main quests and was already being told to got back to Novigrad. 




 The outcome is not the same. My play went off without a hitch, people applauded and I bowed like a boss.  




 I just mash the jump button when he is in the air. 




 I just walked away like a Boss. That sack of flour is mine now bitch! 




 P^s^^s^^^s^^^^t, ^^^^^it's ^^^^^a ^^^^^she. ^^^^^I ^^^^^made ^^^^^the ^^^^^same ^^^^^mistake ^^^^^and ^^^^^got ^^^^^crucified. 




 Definitely got the moves like Jagger. 














 Just because something looks like it may be a threat does not give the officer the right to murder a civilian. The police have to completely change their manner of conduct to keep in par with the military style of policing that they seem to love so much. Before a single shot is fired you must confirm that the "enemy" is armed and dangerous. A good way of doing this would be making an officer confirm with his partner before opening fire. Instead of just thinking he's a gun totting bad ass sheriff saving the town. 




 This is my theory. A lot of these cops are pussy's. They are constantly scared and will react to **anything** they think has a slight possibility of endangering their lives. 


"OMG he's turning around, he *might* have a gun!"


Another thing I never understood is why carry real ammunition if your main objective is to arrest a suspect. Rubber bullets will stop a man in his tracks and guess what, they don't kill. 




 If he's not Homeless RCMPolice then who is?  




 I think you meant Cervezaa!! 




 If it were to have the actual PC components built into the keyboard then I would be amazed. This is just stupid. 




 Ayyy lmao. 




 I'm not from the states so I had no idea it was supposed to be a mocking jay, I've always seen a man doing the Hussain Bolt but now that you mention it, yes, it definitely is Johnny. 




 spend less than you make


Is this not common knowledge in America? 




 If you have a decent PC to begin with. 




  I've been a PC gamer for 5 years now, in that time I've gone through 3000 worth of hardware. Why? It's my hobby, I like doing it. Do you need a 3000 PC to play games? No. No you don't.

 nbsp;

And this is exactly what I mean, you will end up wasting more money than if you had bought a console. Yes I know he claims it is his hobby **but** that is exactly what it becomes for everyone and that my friend is where the money goes, you will end up upgrading parts and spending a lot of money.
 




 I agree about the prices for games and subscriptions, they can be a bit outlandish but I'm happy to pay it if it makes gaming a simple and enjoyable experience. Also don't get me wrong either I have nothing against PC gaming, to each his own. What gets me is when people claim PC gaming to be cheaper than console (strictly talking about the rig). I paid 350 for my console and that will last me for the next 5 years or so. I highly doubt you can build a PC for that price which will play all the games that come out in the near future without having to upgrade a few components. I just don't see how it can be cheaper apart from game deals and subscriptions. 




 Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles. 




 I wanted to take my finger off but I just couldn't. 




 Care to explain how this simply is not true? And don't give me a list of cheap parts that barely get the job done. 




 It's gotten to the point where I really don't care any more, nothing is ever going to change. The rich will continue to get richer whilst stealing from the poor. It has been happening for millenniums and it sure as hell is not going to stop now. This is the world we live in. 




 We know it was actual game play, that's why it looks crap. CGi trailer would've been better IMO. 




 So play it with the camera panned out is what you're saying? You cannot defend the graphics in the trailer, they are crap. Only reason you would do so is because you're a fan boy. This would have been any other game and the trailer would've gotten Rekt, but since it's a Bethseda game, let the Reddit circle jerk commence. 




 Reading that has fucked with my eyes. 




 It is, I haven't played a game that took me this long to complete the main story line in very long while. I was obviously doing some fucking around but most of the time I was questing. Just finished the main quests yesterday and I still have a good few days of content left if not more. 




 ...except a huge hole in my wallet where my money used to be. 




 Don't know why these fan boys are down voting you. I've never played Fall Out so I can't say much about the series. But I can comment on the trailer I saw and it was just meh. The visuals are crap to say the least and this is a trailer, which will always looks better than the actual game.  




 Buy a console, problem solved. 




 Buy a console. You'll save money in the long run. 




 I found him!


See Obama?? Go up until you reach the few last rows of seats near the top then a few columns to the left. The guy in white sitting in front of the woman in white, he is clearly not form our time. 




 French. Can't stand it, even in their accent you can tell the entire nation is stuck up it's own butthole. 




 ...and this is why I don't buy digital, can't trust it. No internet, no game. 




 This and the ability to deselect quests so I don't have to remove it entirely from the HUD. 




 Oh well I ended up just leaving it locked. I'm guessing either the devs forgot **or** it may be a treasure hunt quest and the key is elsewhere. 









 Ok so I'm in the Elven Ruins collecting the Sunstone. I have obviously had a good look around and picked up a tonne of loot. I have opened all chests, except one which of course is locked. I have searched everywhere, been doing so for a good while now but no luck in finding the god damn key.

 nbsp;

It is the chest in the room with the door [The only room with a door in the entire elven ruins] and also had two ghosts protecting it, but none had the key. Does anybody know where this key is?? 




 Not going to uni, I'm 24 now and feel like I will never get that "going away and discovering myself" stage of my life. 




 Any body else read that in a Mexican accent?? 




 ...and to top it off it's a repost. Scum Bag OP. 




 Some one call the facts police cause /u/Lawnsrevenge just got checked! 




 Disney basically paved the way once Walt died. 




 Hey OP I have an idea for the inventory if you would like to add it in. Drop Down lists like used in the Bestiary and Alchemy tabs. They could still keep the same format as now (i.e weapons and armour, usable items etc) but just add subsections (i.e Oils, bombs, potions etc). That's my two cents, nice list hope they see it! 




 might be a bit late but be careful though they might not stay forever. 




 Thanks!, I'll test it with a few misc items and see how it goes. 




 I'm at work now but I'm pretty sure it's that one. The description says something along the lines of "Gerlat found this letter as soon as he arrived in White Orchard and proceeded to read it". You may be right by saying it's bugged because i know for a fact the I have raped White Orchard. There is nothing left to do there except this quest (and I hate leaving quests in my quest tab). 




 It's like asking how many bowls of your favourite cereal you've had in your life. 




 No fucking way, did you record me playing?? I did this exact thing yesterday whilst on this exact quest. 




 I'm with you on this. Now I'm going to be extra vigilant for loading screens just because they promised. 




 does it stay there indefinitely though?? Cause if so I'm going to find myself a nice little abandoned house or cave to use as my stash house. 




 Ok so I have a treasure hunt which you receive in White Orchard. I never read the letter as I was new to the game and had no idea what I was doing. Now I'm nearing the end and have this treasure quest I cannot complete because I must first read a letter I found at the beginning of the game which I sold not knowing it was important and ofc I have no idea who I sold it too. So yea just keep them, they weigh 0.01 so there is not point in getting rid of them. Hopefully the will update the inventory menu and make a separate section for notes   books.
