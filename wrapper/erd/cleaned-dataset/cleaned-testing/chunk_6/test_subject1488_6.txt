 Crafts like bracelets. 




 What kind of camp are you going to? I'm old and don't know of any camps but I still want to go! 




 I've done that multiple times for school and work. If you get enough caffeine you'll get the over tired energy and be wide awake until you suddenly CRASH which is hopefully after the shift. Which hotel do you work at? (If it's a chain) 




 If you had the dope now you have wouldn't have to worry about shitting. 




 I'm fucked up so now I'm apathetic and act like an asshole. 




 For $600 in Cali, you'll live in a shitty area/apartment. Find a roommate, either someone near a college, via craigslist, through subreddits. You're better off renting a room for $400ish with a few roommates. 




 Yes and it always gets it right. Knows me so well. We're good friends. 




 Idk where you live. Get a sub and fries. Or Chinese 




 Me neither. Fuck shit, bang bang.

 Marketing 




 That's what I'm saying. No one should pay for them. As far as myself, lots of food and condiments, coffee, mugs, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, towels. 




 Do you work in accounting?  




 Ketchup, salt, pepper. 




 Most recently, inside out. 




 Seems more of what he should be drawing than may actually be drawing. But hilarious and awesome, nonetheless. 




 Buffalo NY, 716. Hello! 




 Cheese and mushroom. But not too hot. Room temp. 




 Same. 




 What programs can help? I'm in the same boat as OP. this would help tremendously. 




 How fast can you make a pizza? What is the cost per pizza to make? 




 1926 




 Yup. Sounds like it. She's probably just used to fucking and not having much relationship type sex. She'll probably love it though. You'll have to teach her! 




 I have a few ideas that kind of make sense. One that is more nonprofit, the other is more art therapy. Ughhhhhh. anxiety. 




 I'm a bad planner and lack motivation and support. I have too many ideas and don't know how to center them. I think a large part of it is my depression. At this point, I'm just happy to be able to get out of bed and go to work in the morning. I don't even know where to begin and everything I read on /r/smallbusiness and /r/entrepreneur is overwhelming. Oh, and I don't know how to promote it. 




 either some kind of arts/craft/decor business or a nonprofit or organization for kids down the wrong path. Mixing both together would be ideal. 




 up! 




 I have the same degree, graduated in May. I've gotten offered sales and marketing jobs but fuck the man. I have business and refuse to contribute to the overwhelming consumerism. I don't care at this point. I'm secure at home for now and will wait until I find a good job. I don't overly care/worry about work, I care about life.

Oh, and I remember reading an article that was on the top 10 companies that hire new college grads. Google that! You're going to have to pay your dues if you want to work in HR, I think. 




 Only read the tl;dr. I think you're 100% normal and have the vegabond bug! You have to take action. Do what you love, continue exploring. This is who you are! Not stuck in an office, not stuck with these people that are doing nothing and are so closed off from the rest of the world, content with staying still. Own it, do it. You are who you are. This could be a career, this could be your life.

 Do it you pussy! (your words not mine)

Ever seen that one Shia Lebeuf film (can't remember the name). He draws a small picture of the girl, then when she walks by, he says "hey did you drop this?" and it has his number on it as well. I think it's cute. I'm a female. 




 I've only seen 37 of these. Don't tell anyone. 




 I need to see this ASAP! 




 Get in touch with the 2 murderers that escaped from prison in NY. they know how to do it. 




 Heroin actually is sometimes cut with ground cocoa puffs and similar cereals. 




 Rice, potatoes, Mac and cheese. Sneak into breakfast at a hotel, take anything portable home, like milk, bread, yogurt, fruit. I probably wouldn't eat the cocoa puffs. Fill a water bottle up in public places like a mall or library. 




 Pen, hair ties, pepper spray.  




 You need to detach yourself from these people, even if they are your blood. 




 I haven't heard anything but I applied early May. I would like to know because I don't want to start a new job and leave in February. For those that did receive anything, did you get an email or did you just keep checking the site? 




 I'll be honest here, stop crying about not having a cell phone. That's not your biggest problem and you need to step back and look at what you're saying. Get a track phone if you're so worried about it. Go to a library and apply for jobs. Ask for them to contact you via email. Go in person and hope for open interviews or an on the spot hire. You got this. If you can't afford a track phone (I think they're like $10/month), ask /r/assistance for help. Good luck, chief. 




 Its June 18 now bro 




 Maybe a kiosk 




 Okay, but sounds like you lived life and made some memories. Who knows if you would have had that opportunity when you were retired or something. 




 What did you spend it on?
 




 The time I fell in love. 




 I wouldn't do much of anything other than introduce myself. That and shovel their sidewalk, mow their sidewalk, take in garbage cans if they're not home.  




 Yes. It's a really dirty high though. Also makes opiates more potent and cures the itchiness associated with it. Or maybe you gave her an STD and her vagina is really itchy. 




 Head over to /r/opiates or /r/opiaterecovery. They can definitely help. I urge you to try kratom or subs. But right now you wanna get antidiarrhea meds. Take a lot and sickness will be bearable. Are you on any anxiety meds? Those help. 




 Mint chocolate and anything fruity and chocolate.  




 hit up a free hotel breakfast. 




 you know the rule, if you post pill porn, you gotta share! 




 Well you need to make some chances, but don't go crazy right away. I think you need to sleep on it. You may want to make a rash decision now and quit but tomorrow you'll realize it'll cause you more problems. You boyfriend is not your world. You are your own person and responsible for your happiness. Start looking at new jobs but most importantly, get active. Do what you love to do and dedicated more time to these things. Experience life and look at work as a small part of life.
 




 Either quit and work with your dad FT.
OR
quit and work at the new company.

Sounds like you shouldn't stay where you are. 




 I'd stay stick it out for a few more months, then look for something else and quit once you have a secure position. You say it doesn't challenge you-- how can you go above and beyond? Work outside your job description. Even if you don't want to be promoted to manager, you may keep your sanity. 




 Astray by let it happen.
Disintegration by turnover. 




 dump your girl and ask new girl out. 




 Well, I think your case is a little extreme. What kind of underwear do you use? Get some cotton or something extremely absorbent. I get ass sweat, but only when doing cardio. I think you have a problem. Certain dry is good for armpits, may want to talk to someone about something similar for all parts of the body.  Botox is known to be used but not sure you want to go down that route. 




 Work boots. 




 What do you do for money? Do you need money? What is the average income? Are prices higher due to seclusion? Do you like it? Is it beautiful? How can I become a resident? 




 you could get aluminum window covers 




 Damn that sucks, but I know what you mean! That's how my work is now. I slave away and do amazing, yet they don't really care.

Electrical would be good. Plumbers, linemen. You start at the bottom but they pay for school and can end up making a real decent salary. 




 he's on some criminal minds shit. He wants to learn women's fears, then make their nightmare a reality to haunt them until their death. 




 Crackers. There are so many different kinds these days.

M Ms. 




 Oh, and try those dutch donut things from a stand outside.
