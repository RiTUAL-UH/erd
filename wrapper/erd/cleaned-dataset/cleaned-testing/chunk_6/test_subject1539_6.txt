 I see your humor by-pass is fully integrated 




 SteamOS 




 EA back to 'worst company ever' - it's a lock-in this year, definite Oscar.

But seriously, if they can't keep their software to its own sandbox and also **request** access to other HD areas, perhaps they've opened a whole new malware vector.

Caveat Emptor 




 Then there was that whole [hospital donation fiasco](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/garth-brooks-awarded-1-million-in-hospital-lawsuit/), which legally went his way - though you've got to wonder how he was commemorating his mother's memory with it. 




 Haven't read the book but apparently it doesn't really explain the disappearances either.

Nonetheless, I'm leaving the Leftovers until there's an opinion on the whole season.

Also never going to a movie that Lindelof has had anything to do with: Cowboys   Aliens, Prometheus, Into Darkness, World War Z. I'm surprised he gets writing offers. 




 I don't remember Malaria being a threat in Japan either. 




 Nobody, not even a Dubliner, should stay in Dublin for more than a fortnight at a time. If you do, the nonsense closes in around you, a bubble of regurgitated cant that smells of stale bullshit.

No, that's just you sweetie 




 There is no better way to guarantee that Climate Change is a real danger than have Rupert non-scientist Murdoch try to minimise it.

He's such a shameless shill.

 




 Cheers for the info and bought a bottle today!!!

Didn't last too long in the fridge :)

All the best with it! 




 Her family? 




 As I understand it, this would have involved the BND clearly breaking the German constitution. 

I guess that reveals the NSA's approach to such legal frameworks more than the German government's response to the offer.

edit: In fairness, /u/trot-trot your recent comment history looks like someone on auto-pilot or beyond frustration or replaced by a bot. Your points are going to be lost with such walls of text   links.  




 Sorry about the THE 









 If the NSA were as successful and useful as they claim they are, the Boston Marathon bombings would never have happened. The culprits would have been caught in flagrante as a show-of-strength and a public reminder of the NSA's value to the US. They were even given specific warnings about the brothers from Russian agencies.
 




 When I remember the internet is ~20 years old, I reckon the NSA have all the info they need to blackmail any USA politician for life.

They must be able to de-rail the political campaigns of anyone they choose with simple innuendo, shame   embarrassment. They'd keep evidence of wrong-doing, if any, as a trump card.

So if someone wants to get into politics in the US without their say-so, they would have to avoid all interent   voice coms from the day they were able to use them until the end of a successful campaign - i.e. next to impossible.

Can we rename them the **N**osy **S**tealth **A**dministration now? 




 'driven by jedward' 




 Just tried his name via DuckDuckGo and there are plenty of links about it, couldn't see the Herald one admittedly.

This one is a toughie I reckon, I can see why maybe after 5 or 10 years - someone should be allowed to 'live things down' especially when there's no obvious 'public interest', the event isn't a continuing one or the people involved aren't politicians etc.

But it's just going to be so near-impossible, then the Streisand effect ... 




 It's hit   miss, but such a good place for a rest during Christmas shopping. 




 Tis only a mild detour though, then a quick rest in Grogan's on the way and they'll be nearly there :) 




 I want to hold them responsible for poisoning national conversations with bullshit   lies.

Then of course there's all the hacking they're currently in and out of court for. 




 This one, definitely this one - you can add the Stag's Head in too on Dame Court. It'll be on your way from Hogan's to McDaid's anyway. 




 True, I'm hoping the need for water might make this one special though. 




 Jesus Tapdancing Christ, can the government set up a commissioner to slap Phil Hogan every time he wants a glass of water!

And:

It was confirmed yesterday by Taoiseach Enda Kenny that Irish Water is to be taken out of the control of the Department of Environment, which is now run by Labour's Alan Kelly, and brought under the auspices of Michael Noonan's Department of Finance.

If Fine Gael think they'll survive privatising water, I'd like to see them try. 









 And he couldn't even cost the water charges for everyone before he left, after 3 years.

Am I right in thinking that he still has to be approved in the EU before he can take the post?

Oh, there will be a by-election too I suppose, or does he keep both? 




 "Any differences that we have are most effectively resolved through established **private channels**, not through the media"

Are there any left? 




 Citing an anonymous U.S. official

citing? 




 Such a happy looking lad that Patrick Coveney ;) 




 I'd like to know the reasoning / market-forces behind the Price of New Games in the EU region (Sterling prices too), my views:

* All main platforms are x86 based these days - I thought this would have helped reduce dev costs and so prices.

* Game assets are built high-res to ensure PC porting (if not already done on PC beforehand anyway)

* It's making me avoid release-day purchases as I can spend that 25 difference on many other games, and frankly other things in life, especially when I can't see a 25 improvement in next-gen games overall.

* It's not just a Sony thing, so apologies if this sounds targeted, but at the current prices I won't be getting release-day games anyway.

* The Second-Hand market is having a field-day with this, so I can't see how the current pricing is benefiting devs.

* Counter-point, games like Watch_Dogs are selling anyway - but I can't be in a small minority, so I reckon a 'market-starvation' effect will be short-lived and ultimately will back-fire.

 




 And now they're calling for an inquiry into policing? What are they going to find?

Who do you mean GSOC, AGS or Prof. Scraton? 




 Perhaps he was getting contracts lined up when he went to Bilderburg the other week:

 I'm very much not an engineer and I guess the soil around there mightn't be suitable. Just with the talk of their demolition, it seems like an oppotunity to put something big, equally iconic and forward-looking in their place.

edit: Apologies, the 'incinerators' are really stacks / chimneys - mea culpa.

 He's having a Mattrick-moment, there will be more. 




 Dear South Park,

If you're reading, please make an episode of this farce.

edit: If Garth could meet Paris I would be so happy. 




 If anyone is wondering, Ming needs a reality check on climate change and he'll need to make it clear:

[Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Information  Brendan Howlin in regard to his recent statement that climate change deniers need to be swept aside, if he is aware that everyone accepts that the climate has been, is and always will be changing, though there are many, including eminent climatologists and scientists, who question whether that change is anthropological, or man-made; the way in which he will sweep these people aside; and if he will make a statement on the matter."](http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000062#N6) 




 Which seems to be a pity. I think it was on an old Vincent Brown that Elaine Byrne talked about tribunal costs - an alarming 500 million yet also recouped 1 billion.

I've tried to find a link, but can't.

Though I suppose the chances in this case of recouping money via a tribunal would be, at least politically, zero. 




 Ah, thanks for the clarification.

I guess we won't be getting a tribunal any time soon then. 




 Does this mean that the banking inquiry can go to the High Court to unseal those cabinet meetings?

Has there been a discussion about this already that I've missed? 














 If he wants to pontificate about getting 67 billion back, he has my blessings. 




 I'm not sure people are forgetting it, I think they're just ignoring it. 




 hehehe 




 Bloody hell, that link.

If only TDs were in such a rush for legislation that actually helped the whole country. 




 I'm not sure how accurate that is but it's nice to hear something about it mentioned in the EU. 

I think the EU is going to suit Ming more than the Dil did. 









 I thought this was a joke piece when I saw the headlines.

Are TDs really going to spend political capital assuaging Garth Brooks   Aiken's greed?

There were both happy to go with 3 concerts at the outset and they still can.

If they don't want **their** original plan anymore, well too fucking bad for them.

And TDs saying this is damaging Ireland's reputation need to shut it, their abject fawning over a few concerts certainly is making us look like eejits. 




 I think tweeting the PS3 master key that geohot unearthed spelled the end of that relationship. 




 In conjunction with games being storable on an external hard-drive, could there be an additional hacking risk / vector in allowing this feature?

It's the first reason for cancelling it that popped into my head. 




 Into a 3v voucher is about the only thing I can think of, not exactly using the account online but nearish. 




 For added confusion here are two other articles on it that appear to contradict each other:

http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/govt-defeated-in-seanad-vote-on-free-gp-care-for-under-6s-635858.html

http://www.thejournal.ie/government-loses-another-seanad-vote-1562521-Jul2014/ 









 And if Garth truly

"cannot begin to tell you how badly my heart is breaking right now 

he'd be happy to play 3 rather than none. 




 Cheers! 









 Another thing that needs to change is the price tag in the EU, 75 (~$100) is too much for a new AAA.

I've gone from being a regular release-day buyer on the PS3 (where new games are 50 to 55) to a definite second-hand buyer on the PS4.

The games haven't suddenly become 25 better or more interesting, the reverse if anything.

So the lull in gaming for me will probably last till December, when I'll be able to buy games for a reasonable price.

So glad I went for Wolfenstein at 50 on release, rather than Watch Dogs at 75. 









 Surprising as that is, and rumour-mill notwithstanding, this:

Dr James Reilly as Foreign Affairs Minister

is gob-smacking.

He might still be have a ministry position!? 




 Don't forget to post to /r/marijuanaenthusiasts :) 




 I guess 'wistful nostalgia' isn't quite the same 




 Tigger 




 I'm going to disagree and go with 'distraction'  




 Touch :) 









 In fairness, the artist's definition is:

'words found in foreign languages that cannot be Anglicised word for word.' 




 They're beautiful and interesting.

While I'm typing, are there words for a 'seasonal lake' = [Turlough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turlough_(lake) in other EU languages or has it become a loan word? 




 So did the government not check with Sky or UPC before this announcement? 




 So cry to Aiken, fuck there are better things for the country to be focusing its attention on. 




 If only we'd something of the same standard as the BBC, but for RT you'd have to pay people to watch it. 




 If ad companies aren't paying for people's broadband, they don't get to decide what's on it. 




 Cheers for that, I'd no idea about Palatines. 




 He said he had stockists in Dublin, unfortunately I can't remember where, though you can buy straight from him in Slane.

Bulmers kinda gives me the horrors, but this stuff is great. 




 And let you do all the 'tasting', taxi so :) 




 We'll have to go for a little spin so. 




 The maker was saying yesterday that there are no known examples of the tree left in Ireland, but he's hoping one will be found somewhere.

And I think 'Cagogee' would be a good name, the first hard 'g' making the second one softer. 




 Dreadful isn't it, and it's a complete shame - it is lovely cider.

I'd actually drink cider more regularly if it tasted like this stuff.

 




 Yeah, I've no idea about the Irish origins of the name but I reckon something like 'Keeva' would be better and still refer to the manufacturing technique. 




 While I'm at it, does the Indo know what a fada is?

 If they keep this kind of thing up, the church here is going to end up like Buddhism in Japan, only requested by people at birth or death ceremonies and ignored the rest of the time.

 Probably not seriously, but it's still a big no-no for reddit rules.

The user should be banned so do report it to the mods, and reddit might be able to fingerprint his/her browser so new accounts can't be made to get around the ban.
 




 This isn't about Garth is it? 




 If you ever do need to test one, use a long blade of grass instead.

It'll result in a mild flick feeling just under the nail of the fingers that are holding it, much safer   less embarrassing. 




 A spokesperson for Minister Hogan said all recent appointments had been made on the basis of the abilities of the individuals to contribute to the relevant bodies.

Yet all the appointments are from Labour or Fine Gael

Plus a change ...

 I've my keys handy already ;) 




 Aye, it's in less of a mood now.

And it's way too sunny to be looking at settings anyway. 




 Good, better than yesterday morning which was a false no-hangover followed by the real hangover in the afternoon.

Nonetheless managed to go to a debate on the 'right-to-be-forgotten' at the Hay festival which while more introductory than anything else was still interesting.

Susan O'Keefe recounted the story of a teacher who told her students to bring an embarrassing photo into school the following day and they'd put it on the school gates.

The students were understandably horrified. To which the teacher replied 'well you put them up online everyday' and the students seemed to get the point.

The representatives from Google   Transparency International were good too - the debate could have gone on for hours I reckon. Probably just as well that it didn't though, the hangover came back with a vengence. Naps were had.

So today I'm all sparkly, up at 7 trying to work out why my home-server is in a mood (or at least the powerline plugs are) and looking forward to the food tent's Beer   Tapas thing at 6 today.

Kinda wish it was earlier. 




 I thought this was resolved, there can be 3 concerts which is already 3 more than the agreement with the residents allows. 




 Today in fail upwards ... 









 I think you're confusing questions with word-salad. 




 Which actually caused a few problems last year, as there is a hay festival just over in Trim at about the same time. 




 Hay Festival - https://www.hayfestival.com/kells/index.aspx?skinid=26

/notkidding 




 Oh, I like that one. 




 Wasn't that the interview that made Martin McGuinness leave before his turn? 




 Ok, I'm heading out now.

Cheers, I'll try to ask the question from /u/BLUNTYEYEDFOOL if I get the chance.

Edit: So didn't get the chance to ask the question, they were limited to questions on WWI in line with his new book. He was excellent, and comes across as not so glowering unless he encounters bullshit which was only one of the questions asked. Great talk, 10/10. 




 it's not meant to be serious, look at the guinness one 




 Just as a side note:

[The Communist Party of Ireland has still not submitted the required statutory documentation [on campaign donations] and the commission referred a file on the matter to the Garda on May 19th.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/files-on-fg-ff-political-donations-referred-to-garda%C3%AD-1.1854072) 




 I'd love to see it too. 

The geographical, geopolitical and theological-cultural* advantages they would have would be astonishing.

My grandparents could never have imagined the Queen of England would have an official visit to Ireland but it happened, it was great and there were no problems.

*I'm sure there's a better word for that, but I'm off to sleep now. 




 All terrible awful things and seemingly intractable in terms of negotiation. But did Hamas spring from nothing? No it sprang from how they feel they are treated.

It doesn't forgive their views or aims, but it does indicate how to weaken them as a driving force in this lengthy conflict. If Hamas are the obstacle then the solution is stop letting them have causes and events they can point to for support.

NI isn't like Israel, but once UK forces killed civilians in Bloody Sunday the conflict radically altered. Similarly, Israel's sometimes disproportionate responses to provocations and Palestinian violence gives Hamas all the cause they need to garner more support.

Cooler heads have to prevail, or the conflict really will be endless. 




 All very important distinctions in history, but the point I wanted to make was about the possibility of similar solutions, or at least the real possibility of a solution. Something NI didn't have for a good while.

Nothing improved in NI until everyone decided the negotiation table was better than attending funerals, and preventing further radicalising events.

As for calls to genocide by Hamas, they are crazy and also not every Palestinian.

Calls to wipe out Catholics / Protestants / Republicans / Unionists haven't vanished in NI either but the anger   grief necessary to create those views has reduced.

tl;dr - Negotiations are the only way out, anything else will be genocide for one side or the other. And if that happens, 50 years from now threads like these will still be posted.

 




 True, but then again the Middle-east has had 1,500 years. 




 This is unkind but I can't help it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3_DjiLLDfo
