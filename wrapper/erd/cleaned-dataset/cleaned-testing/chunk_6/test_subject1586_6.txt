 Dude, Johnny gets SOME blame. The idea that he doesn't is silly. 




 It was,  but I was moving to Atlanta,  and missed the whole thing.   




 Bad form. Go Browns. 




 This year looked rough on paper, and then playoff calibre teams' seasons tanked and we beat 'em. 




 Yeah, historically he sucks against the Bengals. 




 [Can't tell if I am being down voted by Hoyer fans for saying I am sure Manziel will get better, or if I am being down voted by Manziel  fans for saying he threw interceptions...]( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/131/399/fry.PNG?1307468855) 




 The people who are calling this season a "Sinking Ship" and that we "screwed up all season by not playing Manzeil" should read this. This has been the most exciting season of football since 95, for me. We have made some great steps forward, and we get to finish off the season letting Johnny get ready for next year. I dont hate it. No more controversy. Go Browns. *edit: I spell like a Steelers fan* 




 Only a Browns fan calls 7-6 after 14 years of 5 or less wins, a sinking ship. I'm not calling for a QB change, but I am hoping that we can keep in perspective how much better we are, and let that be a building block we are proud of. Todays game sucked. Now to next week. 




 Sorry. I was downvoted to hell and told this is how we think on this sub, so I am just holding the line that the fanbase set down. It's our fault, not the refs, sorry. Go Browns. 




 He did throw 3 (2 were upheld) Interceptions. *shrug* I'm sure he'll get better.
 




 Did you think this fanbase, with the way it treated a 7-5 QB after only one other winning season in 15 years, would give Johnny a break? 
 




 I agree with this. It would have been nice to get the same for Hoyer. I am all in with whoever we pick, I just think the infighting over the QB makes me yearn for Connor Shaw.
 




 To quote what was said by /u/slapdog238 : "As a Browns fan who has lived all over the country, I can assure you, every. single. fanbase. thinks the very same thing. It's a copout. Our team is simply not playing well." Though I agree with you. Go Browns

 Do I look like I'm jumpin' nimbly pimbly from tree to tree? 




 TEAM NFL. I dont even think thats an NFL company anymore.
 




 Because the signature of a ghost is more easily imprinted magnetically onto film?  




 I lurk here pretty hard. This is awesome footage.  




 [As a Ravens fan, you're technically a Browns fan, anyway.]( http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130303064521/glee/images/6/6b/Tumblr_m69gmgBqVj1rskeexo1_500.gif) 




 They are probably the crown jewel of my Browns collection. Good looking out! 




 Inherited them from my uncle. He's only 13 months my senior, and his dad (my Papa) is a long time season ticket holder, and his buddy used to be the equipment manager through '95 and the Ravens kept him on. But that's a long story for a pair of shoes. I'm just lucky as hell to have 'em. Thanks again. Go Browns. 




 Rocking out the vintage TEAM NFL kicks, and my Battle of Ohio towel from the 2012 home game with no advertisers marks on it,  and to celebrate wearing the vintage kicks; My new Haden jersey. Go Browns! 









 I say this with all sincerity. I want to be excited. I have been so disillusioned by the Hoyer Hate Vs Manzeil Hate on the sub that I am having a really hard time being getting there. I'm Brown and Orange till I die. Heres to getting excited, and a unified fan base. Go Browns. 




 Does anyone know where they are dumping the raw files? 




 Very true. 




 Indeed. I've always liked old school Seahawks fans.  




 I'm a big fan of Hoyer's. I know better than to buy a Cleveland QB jersey. 




 [Top Jerseys Seller]( http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1066076) 




 Yes 




 A little tight, but I suggest if your player was on the team in 2012, look for one of those. They rock and are super comfortable. 




 It got to me in 3 weeks, my child. Though I had to ship it to GA, then have it shipped to me in WA, because of some thing about keeping the payment in escrow while it processes. You might get it in 13 days. I have had quick turnaround on both of my orders. Blessings on your Secondary from my new favorite nickname: Interception Jesus. 




 Also, owning a Reebok jersey and  Nike jersey, I can officially say the Nike ones are not as stylish. 









 This is why The Haden Jersey is in the mail.  




 Thanks for the consideration, this was a powerful evening for me and I thank anyone who gives this picture a shot, in advance. 









 Totally understandable!  




 I am LBQT, so if I could please post this picture, that would be perfect.
 




 I knew it was Lil John when I read the headline "Fox sends little person to Cincinnati press conference" Epic. I would sport that flair all day. 




 Love me some Little John! 









 Totes fake. I was about to say: "I hope Hoyer knocked Johnny the fuck out" because this crap would be the ugliest, least mature move, ever. I'd stop watching the season if my man acted like that. 




 I'll upvote once for ya, Professor. 




 All I'm saying is: I get it. He pawned a ring. Now let's move on and get back to the rest of the library of songs by Sublime. All of which are amazing. It breaks my heart that there is a song that I dont like.
 




 So, 'Yes'. It's okay. You'll chill, and gel, eventually. 




 Pawn Shop by Sublime  




 New Browns fan? 




 Go Browns 




 Pettine's awesome. 




 He's usually clutch. If the only time he hit the field was a clutch situation, then the odds are in his favor of being really good, plus, (and I am officially excited to see him play) Johnny's GONNA get hurt with his style. It's not 'if', but 'when'. He was lucky to not have gotten hurt on that TD scramble. He took a crazy hit to the side during the play. Plus we know that Hoyer is better than any backup or starter since we got back in '99, so he's a safe bet. If he can't get a starting job somewhere, I hope we sign him as a backup. 




 He had a good run. I hope we keep him as a backup QB. Heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrreeeeeee's Johnny. Cundiff should retire to Baltimore. 




 This is actually full of truths.
 




 They should change that jumbotron THIRD DOWN graphic to any other color combination than the current Yellow and Black. 




 Yeah, or when the Big Brown D gets pentatration to stuff the tight end. Big fan. 




 I say we bring in Manziel to kick. He has college experience.  




 That honor is reserved for that slack ass Raven in a Browns uniform. I swear to Christ that Baltimore is paying him to miss kicks, on the side. 




 /r/skinwalkers 




 Wow...this is trash. 




 
I think this is the closest to what will actually happen. 




 I've been pretty much addicted since I found it. [Nice to meet you.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hi.gif)  




 Ahhhh, snarky insults. A rarity on reddit. It's possible that this is a couple months old. I searched the sub before I posted it because I work a lot and dont always stay abreast of my string and two cans. I'll just go back to reading the posts on this sub. Thank you. 




 I was not hip on the all nude spreads, penetration, or more hardcore posts. I respect and hold (somewhat) your opinion. I dont want people to make a job out of filling our sub with woman-flesh. I can-not, however, as a warm blooded North-East Ohio sports fan, turn down a girl when she has Cleveland Browns Pasties on and tells me she is proud of us beating the Falcons, and would I like to reward the sub with her ample chest? I'm probably going to take that picture and post it every time. Not because it's pornographic, but because we all earned it, and deserve to bask in the gifts given to us by our supporters. You will PROBABLY not see any more pics from me on the subject, but I also cant promise that another girl from my church isnt going to be like "Hey! you beat the Colts! Lemme take a boob picture in a cowboy hat for your sub!" I wouldnt have the heart to not take and share the unique bounty that being a winning Browns Fan on this sub generates. I'm sorry if you are offended. And I'm not annoyed by your opinions. I'm simply down hearted by the energy that has swept over this sub, recently. People attacking other subs, attacking our own members, and a general air of "We are a serious ball club sans shenanigans" has me a little down, but your opinions are sacred, because they are your opinions. Go Browns 




 This is akin to saying "I like presents,  but save all your gift giving until Christmas. Don't give any gifts until it's seasonally appropriate." But that's just my opinion.  I can look at harlots on the Web all day,  but bare breasted Browns fans only exist in certain places,  and I want to see them whenever our female fans are ready. 




 They aren't mine. I only captured them on film. I agree with people not asking for boob pics, but if a female Browns fan can't take a picture of her ample bosom in celebration of a win, then I dont know how we can call this THE Browns subreddit. If people were hounding folks for pictures, I could understand, but freely given Brownie Boobies being down voted when it's part of our history, dare I say, part of the very lifeblood of our membership; like beer and bad memes and down voting to punish people that are different. It's part of us. Dont hate. Participate. 




 These were the same boobs that can be found [in this pink bra](http://i.imgur.com/DUd72BT.jpg) These were a gift for beating the Falcons last week. Go Browns! 









 Just posting the news coming through the wire. It's not my job to prove or disprove, only to populate the sub with conspiracies, and that being said, yes, more evidence. 









  Tim Tebow won a playoff game for the Broncos. Does that mean they shouldn't have replaced him with Peyton Manning?

And as of right now, the only thing comparable between Manzeil and Manning are that they both start with M-A-N. 




 Yeah, splitting the energy of the fanbase isnt my favorite idea. I would rather have the conversations here. I'm all in on Hoyer, and I wouldnt want to spend all my time with people who just wanted to talk about him. *This in no way is an endorsement for either QB. We Bark Together* 




 [Do The Money With Me!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/wic.gif) 




 I was really happy to see this happen when it did. 5 ints and no tds over two games is the right time to put someone on the bench and make them  watch their replacement. He did better than I thought in certain cases, and worse than I thought he would be in others. Good stuff from him though, and I'm glad he got his start. I do not, however, think they will keep him in next week. Just a hunch. We'll see. 




 But you did say this:

 Ahh, the victim complex. Classic!

Which is the same as

 you're too much of a homer to see it.

in that we dont need to trash each other on this sub. We're supposed to be the best fans in the NFL. Let's do that. We dont need to blitz each other when there is so many boobs, beers, and dogs with hats to make us the envy of /r/nfl. It's all irie.  




 Not everything is about you. Jeeeesh!  




  you're too much of a homer to see it.

We dont need to call names. I'm one of the most chill fans out there. I'm just commenting that I saw a lot of busted calls. I DONT usually see or say such things. You generalized me on a single opinion. Again: We're all on the same side, here. 




 And you are being all aggressive, attacking and mean. I'm not the thing you're mad at. I'm on your side in this sub.
 




 He says as I watch illegal block after holding call not get called against the Red White and Blue. 




 He says as I watch Orton Draw the D offside by illegally shaking his head and arms and not being called.
 




 He says as I watch the yellow flags increase to 8 vs 5 for the Bills 




 I just want to know what they have to do to get to wear those black and white stripes. 




 In the KITCHEN!!!! Ishmaa'ily is a MONSTER! 




 When did being a smoker start being called being an "ent"? also, where does "ent" come from? 




 Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison were all found dead with white lighters in their pockets, and then Jerry Garcia coined that they were bad luck. Also, historically, black and white were the only colors of bic lighter, and you could more easily see the resin from the pipes you smoked with it, making the cops more easily recognize your pot smoking.  




 White lighters are bad luck. Retake with a new lighter.

 




 **E** 




 A flea. 




 They've played 11 and it's 12 weeks in. 




 "The Browns are still the Browns"? That's racist sir. You're racist. 




 Best division in history is the current AFC North. Never have all the teams in a division been 3 games over .500, 13 games in.  




 I don't have that problem and I am subscribed to a bunch of subs 




 I can't upvote this enough. 




 Gotta admit that this doesnt happen to Hoyer, Thomas, Haden, Gipson, Dansby, Whitner, Dray, Pettine, or anyone else on the Browns. 




 Johnny Manziel might not be a trouble maker, but trouble sure finds him. Cant wait till he's the starter and is still doing BS like this. This junk makes him look like a thuggish child. Who let's their crew beat the shit out of folks? Plaxico. Next thing he'll be shooting himself in the leg and wearing sweat pants to night clubs.  




 Most of those mistakes were to Gordon, to be fair. I bet the rhythm is way better next week.
 




 Browns. 




 Going Browns in 3....2.....*holds single finger up quietly and points to you* 




 Nope, people on this sub sometimes use the downvote and a lot of ugly talk as weapons when they dont agree with you. Not just your issue. 




 **O** 




 *Insert lecture on knowing and/or repeating history* 




 I can appreciate that you feel comfortable likening an interception in a football game to the genocide of a people. I'll keep that in mind for next time. Also: "Downvote for likening an interception in a football game to the genocide of a people" 




 Because its Browns History, and its in the current news stream. 




 Thank you for noticing. I have been all over reddits nfl pages, and we totally compete for best put together and aesthetics. *EDIT: [Case in point the Arizona Cardinals Subreddit. Sketchy neighborhood for sure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaCardinals/) 




 TIL: Pontbraind sold a jersey. 




 We also need a gif of him [patting Watt on the head after he ran into his leg.

 Nice try, Josh. You should just be happy with the reinstatement. Dont try to get free Omaha Steaks from people.  




 I agree. I'm just sharing the news on the wire. 




 As my colleague above stated, as shown to us by the Large Hadron Collider experiments, all signs point to "Go Browns". It was more important than finding the Higgs-Boson. Surprised you didnt read about it.
 









 It's WAY worse than Hoyer, who is in the 70% range.  




 Johnny Jamboogie is the savior of instagram, not Cleveland. That's the Destroyers job. 




 Hoyer-wut? 




 I hope you enjoy that low hanging fruit! Also, his win percentage is 40.6% L33t4shure 




 Ooooo! Now post his win percentage! *This is fun!* 




 Since this is obviously just fan fiction, I burn it, or turn off my computer. Then I go get my free health care checkup.
