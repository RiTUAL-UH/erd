 "talented" youngsters (whether or not they are truly talented) are expensive nowadays. Every team want's to pick up some of these people to sell years later or hope that they become the next big name. 





























 Not sure if tradition is 90% better... I almost always open with Liberty, because I know I will end up with like 8-10 cities after battling some opponents. I think Liberty is worth it as a long term investment, if you plan to fight (which almost everyone has to playing higher levels).

But you are probably right, tradition is better for beginners.

Honor is also important, should at least unlock it to get culture points for killing barbarians. This is almost always my 1st or 2nd unlock. 




 Building some wonders yourself will make your battles easier (e.g. build the great wall yourself, or status of zeus). Some wonders (like the Oracle) have a one time effect, so I tend to build those myself as well, if possible.

 




 But I heard that bees only sting others when they are in absolute danger. If they don't "know" that losing their stingers will kill them, wouldn't it be more logical to sting more often? 




 It's another way of playing, not necessarily good or bad. Teams often have short corners prepare as a surprise weapon against their opponents. 














 clippy was such a fun character, wasn't it? 




 It's true that from a ranking perspective, when someone moves up (because they improved), someone has to move down (even if their playing level stays the same). But Levon is just losing lots of rating points and playing badly, so yeah, maybe it not just about someone moving up and down the ladder. 









 If this is true, it's really surprising to see how getting engaged has such a big impact on your career! 









 Anyone know what happened to him? Why is he losing like every game? Please come back and show us some good chess! 














 Wasn't he believed to be the next C Ronaldo? Just 7m now? 




 So essentially, Juventus sells half of him for 10m, and buy 100% of him for 18m next season? That sounds pretty good. 




 I didn't create the list, I found it on my LinkedIn network. 




 How many people feel mad?  



















 When they say (I didn't create this list, btw) Ideas are worth shit, they don't literally mean it I guess :) 




 E.g. it's better to own 0.1% of Google than to own 100% of your own startup with just yourself.

Meaning: you should not be afraid of raising money and diluting your own equity position.  




 Yeah, I am just in the process of learning how to do this! 




 Thanks! This is really, really helpful! 














 1) Not really, there are a lot of position available (at least when I was in my undergrad) and a lot of the unpopular jobs get no applications. You need to be receiving OSAP to qualify though.

2) Wages will all be at $11.25 (when you start), some department will add an extra $1 or $2 on top of it.

3) I worked at the Alumni Relations office at Rotman when I was in my 3rd year. It was great, fun and you get to know a lot of alums who do interesting things.

4) Work study should be the easiest (and most flexible). If you know programming (since you worked at IBM), perhaps work as a contract developer for others? 




 Ahh, I know what the problem is. It's thearima.com, no www in front. Sorry about it.

50. Have fun!  




 That's exactly what I am asking here.

It is possible to fill in the missing values with averages, it's also possible to even throw all entries with missing values out (due to the nature of the problem - we are not looking into making a prediction for every company, just pick out the better ones). I guess what I should ask is if there are methods that can handle missing values (i.e. the classifier implicitly deals with them). I think trees is such a type, although I am not terribly sure. 









 Edit 1: The scenario is the following:

A venture capital firm would like to predict which companies are interesting based on some stats like money raised to date, the industry they are in, # of employees, etc. And they get this information from 3 online databases. In some of the companies available on the databases, information are missing. My guess would be they are missing because the firm is small or has been inactive for a period time, and hence not updates. 




 I really don't think there are ideas that nobody else has done before, in the sense that it is entirely new. Most ideas that you think about are probably tried before (which you may not be aware of, since there are so many startups out there).

I would suggest talk to people about it. Speak with your family, friends, and talk to people online. One advice I'd give you is don't be afraid that people will steal your idea, because they won't. 




 Please look at mine as well, thanks!

 Yeah, I had that feeling too.
 




 I liked it, but I think there are too many unnecessary deaths. 









 Take first year seminar courses. 




 It's not the worst since it's not part of your so-to-say core courses, but still failing a course does not make your transcript look good.

I am assuming what you are taking is MAT223 (correct me if I am wrong), and since this course usually does not curve students, I'd recommend speaking with your instructor immediately and explain your situation to him/her (e.g. I don't come from math and am taking the course for my own curiosity, I need to go to grad school for reasons xyz, blah blah blah). Sometimes this will help because the instructor is often a student (grad) himself, so they have some sympathy for students (not always true though) and maybe would bump up your mark by a few points. I'd also recommend seeing him in person (prepare your speech) instead of sending emails.

Other than that, not much I can suggest. Perhaps take some easy courses to make up for your GPA if you failed or did badly. 




 In the New Yorkers cover story profile, Marc Andreeseen talked about how he and Ben Horowitz are building a different kind of venture capital business.

One of the key elements is offering services to startups within A16zs portfolio beyond money. This approach involves 65 in-house specialists focused on executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing.

We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years, Andreessen said.

It got me thinking about whether VCs should be providing services to startups, rather than simply giving them money, advice and, theoretically, networking opportunities. Should VCs serve as service agencies that can proactively meet the needs of portfolio companies directly or indirectly?

Many startup entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, are smart, but they dont know what they dont know. They may be excellent developers or engineers, but they have limited knowledge or expertise about areas such as sales, marketing, finance or hiring.

To be successful, startups need to make the right decisions about multiple things and hire the right people. Some of their hires will be external  consultants, contractors, part-timers, interns, etc.

The question is how do startups make sure they attract the best talent to drive growth? They could spend time searching for good fits through research, asking their networks for advice, or simply hiring their friends (a common HR tactic).

But perhaps a better approach is having their VC become a one-stop HR destination for whatever a startup needs. Some of these services could be delivered by in-house specialists, while other services could come from a roster of strategic partners.

This could be a more efficient and effective way for startups to operate while VCs would achieve two goals: ensure their startups are making the right decisions to achieve their goals, and delivering value.

For better-financed VCs, it may be financially viable to have in-house expertise. For other VCs, it could involve building a roster of partners with a variety of skills. These partners would not only be hired guns but could be tapped for their expertise in other, non-formal ways  e.g. coffee, phone calls, etc. This would create a success-driven ecosystem that would eliminate some of the operational challenges facing startups.

What do you think? What role should VCs play to ensure the success of their startup investments? Are VCs about capital and advice, or should they be more pro-active?

 Yeah, any sport at the competitive levels is intense. It's very different playing badminton yourself (most likely in a relaxed way) vs. watching it on tv. 




 I think this is targeting a really, really niche market, and your value proposition (The goal is to create a well known and respected community that can address the failure of crowdfunding platforms to allow effective community policing of campaigns) will attract little people.  




 leadership, for example. 









 Being a good player, imo, is more than just technical skills, and I think Maradona has way more of these than Messi (not saying that his techniques are inferior). 




 I think at least one of Berardi or Zaza will join. 




 I suggest talking to others in person. This is much more helpful than trying to find some user testing groups. 

You can also try userpeek, which, I think, this the relatively better user testing group. 




 Is this the AI playing or a human player? 




 wow, first time as well. 









 Sad to see them go. They used to be a club with great players.
