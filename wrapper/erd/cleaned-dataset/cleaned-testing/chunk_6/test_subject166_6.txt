 I wish I could afford to travel to all of them.  Just beautiful. 




 This was the year my parents moved to Las Vegas.  May check out the Google Earth mentioned in the comments below.  So many memories. 









 Just not sure where I should post this.. 














 Great looking couple!  They look like they should have been cast on the Mod Squad. 




 Dream on.  I have a 401(k) that is 30 yrs old and is worth about the same as it was then. 




 Their deal will cost me about $400/mo.  I remember I was not working and had to pay taxes on my unemployment.  That also happened during that period. 




 And sat on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors for 12 yrs. 









 I hope Dems do not get passive, and actively pursue voter registration of these folks. 














 They actually paid more -- 110%. 




 Gret comments. 




 That was beautiful. 




 You will spend a lot of time driving between sites.  You may want Tito look at travel times. 




 You're missing all the wonderful parks in Utah!  Check them out. 




 Nice. 









 We would have two more crazy senators. 




 Wow.  Just having Bernie tour the country would be great. 




 Me too.  If you go back further, you have FDR which I think was our best president ever.  Would have liked to live during his tenure.  My grandparents loved him. 




 I loved to listen to Clinton talk (yes, he is the explainer in chief), but he was not our best president.  The trade bills hurt Americans, except for CEOs on international companies and repealed the Glass-Stegall Act.  That being said, unemployment was the lowest I've seen in my lifetime. 




 They turned off the debt clock in New York City because it was going backwards.  They didn't want to pay bonds off before they were due, so essentially we did have a surplus. 




 They may shift the burden to state governments, but usually with the money.  It's called block grants to the states, and states decide thier priorities. 




 Most local governments are paying for medical care now at County Hospitals that can't turn people away.   




 Medicare, Part E - E for everybody. 




 Thank you! 




  I can't find my saved items on Reddit anymore.   




 I just learned that.  I've been upset over the fact that I didn't go see it when I was at Black Rock. 




 For sure. 




 I think small businesses were better off before the large corporations took over.
 




 Based on your opinion.  I'm not sure how you could factually document why smaller government is better.   




 I'm not sure how good it is now, but it used to be that veteran's had the highest satisfaction with their health care. 




 I think Section 8 was to get federal money to private investors who could buy housing/apartments and get their mortgage paid by the government.  Section 8 made a lot of people money.  They was also a huge HUD scandal during the Reagan administration that cost us billions.  You don't hear anything about it today. 




 I used to think that the South would only vote for a republican OR another southerner, i.e. Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton.   They turned against both of them though.  Jimmy Carter, a real evangelical! 




 Time to revisit the "Two Santa Theory" of republican tactics:

 Single payer would make sense.  Some parts of the economy should be for the public good, not private profit. 




 I also wonder how much they are paid to be trolls. 




 Seniors use to vote Democratic because they were grateful for medicare and social security.  I can't believe how they have changed.  It's got to be fear. 




 I have a legend I would like to know if it was true or not.  My parents told me that prior to central air conditioning, hotels bought cooks cases of beer to cool off during hot desert summers in Las Vegas. 




 She is a real artist.  Very creative and beautiful. 




 I think you are right. They should pay a price, and they were heading towards bringing down the world economy - because they didn't like a law. 




 And how much did it cost? 









 Yeah! 









 Many employers USED to think of their employees as family, and care about their wellbeing.  Now, it is only the bottom line.  I think alot has to do with local, small businesses vs corporations who don't know or care about the employee.

 He was active during Clinton's impeachment. 




 I think you are right. 




 How about a war started on false premise, or the econy collapse. Those two items should be enough. 




 I read a book recently that said World War I didn't end until the fall of the Berlin wall in the 1980's. I think this guy has it right. They are still fighting over state's rights which should have been settled in the Civil War. 









 Right now, Matt Taibbi. 




 I saw Ted Cruz's father on C-Span and all I can say is that I understand why Cruz is the way he is. His father is an absolute lunatic. 




 There is a great book published during the Bush years called "The Banana Republicans".

 You are absolutely correct.  There may be only 30 who consider themselves moderate.  There is plenty of documentation to back this up. 




 I love their sense of humor.  That's great. 




 Unfortunately, you are correct. 




 My favorite politician EVER. 









 I kind of like that idea. 




 Religion is based on faith, not reason. 




 There are a lot of wonderful Christians who do help.  I know them!  But as a group, they are capable of bringing the whole system down - like in the debt ceiling confrontation happening in congress, or the lack of belief in science and the denial of global warming, which will create untold horrors.  And, in the end, do we really want children to go hungry? 




 There are probably programs at your county that will pay for a year of your schooling for a year of paid service.  You should talk with the counselor at your college. 


 




 The above post is a repost from politics to Vegas.  Let's hope this guy isn't right. 









 It wasn't a filibuster; it only looked like one on tv. 




 I wondered about that too. 




 There are sure a lot of right wing folks on reddit.  




 

















I guess you never read John Locke.



 




 They tried to in Wisconsin, and lost.

 I'm just sick thinking how seniors are now mostly republicans. Dens brought them social security and medicare. They used to know this and support dems. 




 FDR was amazing. Can't believe he hasn't been mentioned. 














 I'd like to see a test showing how you could change people's minds about a social issue in the short run.  
























 Exactly.  He was awfully quiet during the Bush years. 




 That's the best definition I ever read.  I would post it if it was in an article format!  Thank you. 




 Reading the comments, I can't believe how many redditors are republican.  Are they ALL on reddit? 




 We don't need to cut the size of government.  We need to go back to collecting taxes from those who can afford it.  A big country needs a big government to do big things. 




 So, we stop educating children???? 









 Many of the rich don't want to pay taxes to support it.  




 I could only wish. 




 I want to be a Millennial. 




 He needs to be fired. 




 I've been saying this forever:  We need to look at a new way to distribute money rather than basing it on work - guaranteed annual income?  I don't see another way for the long term. 









 Good article.  I watched Elizabeth Drew religiously on PBS during the Watergate hearings.  
 




 I want to sign and send it out to all my friends, but I can't get in to the petition!  Will try later today and see if it is the same. 




 You did great. 




 Plentiful jobs at low wages. 




 Thanks for the posting.  I was wondering where the other bridges were located.

 Interesting concept.  I used to think they had not been in control of  congress for so long, they didn't know how to govern. When they did control Congress, they did a terrible job on it. I still believe that they don't know how to govern, but how we got there may be different than what I thought.  We do have a problem with the constitution and giving them more representation than they deserve.  I'm not sure we will ever get them out. 




 A few years ago (when I was 60), I started dieting - I did my own diet of low carb, low calorie.  It was tough.  It took forever for the weight to start to drop.  I started walking - a little more each day - and did leg presses at the gym to get my strength up.  It took a while, but easily got up to 3 miles/day x 6 days/week - 20 minute mile - about 1 hr/day.  I only lost 30 lbs, but my pant size went from a 20 to a 12.  I stopped and it all came back very quickly.  I'm having trouble getting motivated again, but I know it works.  My doctor was really pleased with my vitals. 




 I hate thiefs. 




 Interesting take.  You may be right. 




 I haven't been to Burning Man, but I've been to the location (Black Rock Desert) for other activities.  It is awesome.  It is so big that when you are on the desert, you can see the curvature of the earth on the horizon.  It would be easy to get lost too. 









 You are right.  Nevada ranks #1 in the inability for people to find full time jobs. 




 This is the second qilded age. 




 I think that is the rule in Las Vegas.  Some restaurants pay like 2.00/hr expecting their employees to make it up in tips.  I think it sucks.
 




 That's the point.  Lift low-income workers salaries and everyone's rise. 




 Music was great and we felt we could change the world.  We failed unfortunately, but it was a good feeling. 




 I remember those!
 




 I have a friend who started buying electronic cigs from China with about $300.  He has built up his business where he now has 4 stores. 




 Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.

 There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day. 

 WHAT: 1st shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 5 AM

 WHAT: 2nd shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 9 AM

 For more information on the strikes contact:

 I wonder who has the "in" for contracts to do it. 




 A lot of boomers believed in politics and public service.  Trying to stop the Vietnam war and starting of the Peace Corps. We thought we could change society.  Many changed in the 80's however.  It's too bad that we failed. 




 Thank you for your thoughtful comments.  I couldn't have said them better. 




 Years ago, we had an anti-welfare march in our town with people who think just like you. I was volunteering at our local legal aid office. One of the leaders of this anti-welfare march was there seeking assistance. He had had a heart attack (no insurance), lost his job, then his wife. He was trying to get some help. He regretted his previous stance. The lesson is that we are all one step away from poverty.  I now work at a welfare office.  When jobs were available, we had a lot less clients. People on the whole prefer to work. 




 You direct your anger at the wrong folks. 




 Campaign finance reform. 




 Yes, I wish that Dems would have tackled this issue first when they were in power (rather than health care).   




 It drives me crazy when I hear people say that Republicans freed the slaves.  The Republicans who freed the slaves would all be Democrats today. 














 Everyone should read your response. It was great. 




 Really good point.  I wish I could give you multiple upvotes! 




 I haven't read the article yet, but I wanted to start a co-op in my community.  It is against the law.  Our electric company provides a partial rebate to few homeowners every 2-4 years to have it installed  for outrageous costs. 



















 Little late now, but I go to the dry lake bed headind towards Laughlin. Young just before you get to Boulder City and it is on the right. Next time. 




 People could get paid, and live a higher standard of living. 




 I agree.  Right now, work is just a way to distribute money for people to live.  And how many people are doing jobs that they hate or are not really productive to society.
