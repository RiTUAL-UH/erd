 For us, it was something along the lines of "The weather decks are now secure to all hand. The smoking lamp is lit in the DC shop."

As for announcing rough seas, they never really did that as the motion of the ship was usually enough to tell you when things were going to be getting worse. 




 I will do that! Thank you :) 




 I will do that! Thank you :) 




 Even at it's worse, there was never a "We may not survive this" feeling. For the most part, everything was ops normal, but more vomit. And this wasn't even the worse that we saw that patrol. There were concerns for those out on the deck, but when those concerns arose, the CO secured the weather decks (basically no one goes out). But it was actually easier for those at the helm as they could see the horizon. That's the key. When you feel sea sick, put your eyes on the horizon as it gives you a sense of stability and  your body can acclimate.  




 It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Of course most of the crew spent a good portion of their time sick... 









 I will! 




 Thank you so much for your help! 




 There in lies the rub. I no longer own the camera. It was dropped into the ocean on my last patrol back in 2005. I've still got all of the exif days on the pictures but the camera is long gone. 




 Mother nature is a powerful force 




 Thank you! 




 It was a rough ride though! 




 Perhaps, but I still find it beautiful 














 That's amazing! 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! 




 Fantastic! Thank you very much!

Do you know if that $55 would cover future photography as well? 




 My concern is the cost. Would I have to register each photo or just the fact that I took a large group of photos? 




 I have recently started posting some images I took years ago to reddit (as can be seen in my history). As I understand it, because I am the photographer, the copyright is inherently mine. Recently, I found a website was taking images directly from a subreddit and rehosting them on their own site. Twice I asked the site admin to remove my images and both times they have complied. However, this last time, they responded demanding that I provide proof of ownership of the images. I'm wondering if I should watermark each image and how to protect myself and my IP in the future with these images. Any advice is welcome. If I don't respond right away, chances are I'm asleep as I work overnights.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

 That is a beautiful shot 




 We were deployed with the navy and ESG5 back in 2004-2005. After the deployment, instead of going back through the Pacific, we proceeded up through the Suez, with a stop in Jordan first.  









 No matter how much I've searched, I can't find an importer anywhere in the states :/ 




 It was amazing when I was there. I remember at one point going somewhere and we turned and found the [Alpine Cheese Festival](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/events/event-29543533.html). It was amazing! I want to go back soooooo bad . 




 I had such a blast there! I want to go back so badly
