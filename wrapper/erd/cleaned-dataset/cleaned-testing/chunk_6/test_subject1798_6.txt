 If you look at the mic/headphone plug, there are 4 sections. The headphone/mic jack has 4 conductors to handle everything separately:

* Left channel out
* Right channel out
* Microphone in
* Common

For a headphone that doesn't have a mic, there are only 3 conductors. The mic conductor isn't touching anything so there isn't any input signal to process. The phone senses this and leaves the on-phone mic turned on. 




 You are absolutely right. I meant my comment to be specific for this bill and re-reading my comment I can see that I was too generic, hence the confusion. The bill got filibustered. The Senate had 3 cloture votes on the House bill--maybe more, I stopped counting-- and all failed. 




 In the Senate, legislation requires a 60% majority (60 votes) to pass. Republicans don't have 60. 




 If it's not ridesharing, as Uber themselves and many others on this comment board have called it, then what is it?

Hint:  Starts with a "T." 




 [Uber drivers are getting 1099-Ks](https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/read-uber-1099) starting this year. 




 1. Uber's drivers are 1099s (hired contractors).

2. Uber can fire a driver, which they do all the time. You get fired if your rating is below 4.2, if I recall. This means they're more than just a service. They're an employer.

3. Ridesharing would work this way:  I'm in San Diego and going to Carlsbad. I have a few extra seats and can give somebody a lift. I use Uber to make a few extra bucks. 'Cept that's not how it actually works. Uber doesn't tell the driver where the passenger is going. This is to prevent the driver from making a decision based on the destination. This completely destroys your belief that it's "ridesharing." Sorry to burst your bubble. 









 You get a pass because you're saving the planet. 




 I'm in Salt Lake City.

Even when you are in a 270 degree cloverleaf, you are probably doing 30 MPH when you come out of the turn and there's (i'm guessing) 500 feet or more before merging. Surely most cars can accelerate from 30 to 65 in 500 feet? 




 I guess that's probably the reason. They don't realize that it's the  relative difference in speed between two cars that makes a situation dangerous.  




 The tiny engine cars obviously aren't what I'm referring to. 95% of cars in the U.S. can easily be traveling at 65 MPH within 2/3rd of most freeway on-ramps. 




 Mostly to get announcements from the groups that I'm a member of and to get time-wastable news links from sources like IFLS. I also think it's kind of cool to see what my older, over-30 friends are up to. Before, I would only see them maybe a few times a year and in those times we usually forget half the important stuff that has happened since the last time. 




 Facebook is evolving. It's definitely not the platform it was one or two years ago. It's not the communication platform like it once was. I've noticed a lot of changes in what people are posting now. Video has really taken off and FB has done a really good job incorporating it. I think FB is like Vine + Pinterest + Twitter, but not necessarily better than any of those other sites at what they do. It's just a kind of one-stop-shop. 




 I think 3.6 will suffice. 









 Comcast customers were reporting shitty Netflix streaming. User testing gave [proof](http://www.measurementlab.net/static/observatory/M-Lab_Interconnection_Study_US.pdf) that Comcast was throttling traffic from Netflix. Comcast denied, denied, denied. 

Netflix caved and [paid a ransom to Comcast,](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790) suddenly no more problems. Netflix also signed a similar agreement with Verizon--who was doing the same thing--a couple months later.

Netflix complained to the Feds, which started the ball rolling on reclassifying broadband as a utility to maintain net neutrality. 









 Why doesn't the U.S. retaliate by raising tariffs on cheap Chinese goods? 









 Imagine two people on a moving train and they are throwing a baseball to each other. If you're on the train and watching them throw the ball, it wouldn't look any different than if the train were not moving.

The airplane is like that ball. It doesn't matter whether the Earth (which is like the train) is moving or sitting still. 




 Thanks, that's helpful advice. 




 What's your commission rate for full commission, and are you under sales goals? 




 That's really helpful. So you like all commission rather than base + commission? It seems like it would appeal to confident and aggressive sales people. 




 I will be hiring salespeople for a startup software company and I want to get feedback on how you like your commission structure, or whether you even have one. Do you help set your sales goals and do you think they are realistic? 




 Then they should go get skillz. Software support positions *start* in the 40s, green developers are getting 70s and sometimes 6 figures.

If somebody's attitude is to say "fuck you" then that's probably why they're stuck at minimum wage. 




 Why should every job pay a living wage? Minimum wage jobs are not considered skilled jobs. They are jobs that unskilled people can work at to gain experience and develop a good work ethic that will help them advance in their careers.

Society will always and should always have jobs that are not going to pay a living wage. A living wage is the incentive to do well at your job and get promoted or get better employment.  









 True, the 1948 war was such a huge factor. King Abdullah I of Trans-Jordan was promised the West Bank in a secret deal so he held back a lot of his forces and never fully committed. To me, that was the most critical piece. Israel was on the brink. There were so many ways that could have played out but the chips fell a certain way because of politics, which Israel played masterfully. 




 Before World War I the entire middle eastern region was a part of the Ottoman empire. Ottomons began as orthodox christians but transitioned to Islam. They were benevolent towards non-muslims, and granted them religious freedom. For most of the 2nd millenium AD the religious makeup of the empire was mostly Christians though the rulers were muslim. Islam gradually grew through the population and became the majority. There wasn't really much religious animosity in the middle east during this time.

The ottomans backed the wrong side and were defeated in WWI. A power vacuum was created and the British were given control of the middle east in what is called the British Mandate. They drew arbitrary lines creating countries without thought to ethnicity, which started the trouble. 

After WWII the British ended the mandate and gave up control. A guy named David Ben Gurion dreamed of a Jewish state and had been pushing for it through the first part of the 20th century. He saw the withdrawal of the British as the perfect opportunity. He worked with the Mandate to create a Jewish, muslim and christian state in Palestine but the borders were never finalized. There was massive jewish immigration out of Europe during WWII, escapees of the holocaust. England and the U.S. were the primary recipients of the immigrants and this was creating a lot of political tension. Ben Gurion promised that a Jewish state would attract Jewish immigrants, taking the pressure off them, so his plan became a desirable solution for the U.K. and the U.S. as well. As soon as the British handed over control (literally on the same day, if I recall), David Ben Gurion declared the Jewish State. the U.S. and U.K. immediately recognized the state, much to the anger of Islamic palestinians who were living there and who were the majority. (I believe Jews were about 15% of the population at the time.)

TL;DR:  Jews, christians and muslims have been living in the area for thousands of years in relative harmony. David Ben Gurion declared a Jewish state when the British vacated control, and the U.S. and U.K. recognized the State, and convinced the U.N. to follow along. Muslims pissed ever since. 




 When the U.S. Constitution was written, a representative democracy was a new concept from the enlightenment but was completely untested. The founders were well versed in history though, and Roman history showed the dangers of populism in a republic. To mitigate against the possibility of the people really screwing up and electing some popular tyrant, they created the electoral college. The belief is that the college would be more thoughtful and could override a bad choice by the voters should they feel it necessary. 




 Who's arguing? I wrote what I believe and respect that others may disagree with me. To me, it's more than semantics and calling Professor Hawking a mathematician is like calling Thomas Wolfe a linguist instead of an author. But again, that's just me. I'm not here to force my viewpoint nor am I passing any judgment on physicists, mathematicians, linguists or authors. They all do different things that have some overlap. 




 When your body starts feeling cold the blood vessels to all of your extremities begin to constrict, including your penis. This helps keep the blood circulating around and warming the most vital organs to protect them. Your penis doesn't have bones or cartilage. It's size all comes down to blood being pumped into it. When the blood leaves, it shrinks. 




 To add to this and help define irony:

Irony is just communicating a thought by saying the opposite thing. Describing your new Mini Cooper by saying "It's sooo HUGE!" is an example of this.

Sarcasm is using irony in a critical way. Example:  Your friend walks into a tree and you say "That was smart."

The difference is your intent, whether it's just to be funny or critical. 




 Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist, not a mathematician. The discipline seeks to explain the physical world using math since a lot of it isn't directly observable.

 Imagine you're sitting in a moving train passing another moving train. Both trains are on the Earth, which is rotating. The Earth is revolving around the sun. The sun is moving through the galaxy. The galaxy is moving through the universe. What's your absolute speed? It's an impossible equation. You can only measure speed in relation to some other object--how fast your train is passing the other train--but not how fast you are moving through the universe. 




 Sand is a great desert topping too but, alas, not a good foundation. 




 Very enlightening. Thanks.

In-situ would result in faster start-to-completion times typically, yes? Reminds me of the hybrid "design-build" rage in the U.S. 




 This is probably a topic for [/r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit). 




 All celestial bodies except black holes emit radiation. That radiation is comprised of many frequencies depending on the matter that it's made of and it's not hard to figure out what those frequency components are. When bodies are moving relative to each other, those frequencies get shifted slightly due to what's called the Doppler Effect (think of a train passing you and the noise it makes as it's approaching vs. traveling away). The faster they move the more the shift is. By looking at a spectral graph of a celestial body we can calculate the speed at which it's moving away or towards us from that shift.

There is no true speed, only speed in relation to a point or another celestial body (such as our Earth). 




 You can program a PBX to display pretty much anything you want for caller-ID. And sometimes a PBX is misconfigured so it displays an extension number that can't be dialed-back. It's best to make it a policy to ask so an emergency dispatcher can make it a part of their routine. There's already enough to think about without having to decide whether to ask for somebody's phone number. 




 Computers use binary computation because it's really easy to just consider an electrical signal as either on or off instead of splitting a voltage into, say, 10 possible values which would greatly increase the chance of making a mistake when reading the signal's value. In a binary math system each digit in a binary number increases the range by a factor of two. A single digit has two values, 0 or 1. A two digit binary number has four values, a three digit number has eight values, and so on ad infinitum.

The bytes and kilobytes refer to memory, either RAM or on a hard drive. You reference data stored in memory by referring to the *address* of the data, i.e. where that data is stored (addresses are sequential, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Computers use binary values for addresses. If you were using 8 digits for addresses, you can have up to 256 memory locations. A 10 bit address has up to 1,024 (a.k.a. 1K) locations. A 16 bit address has 65,536 addresses (a.k.a. 64K). 









 She'll make somebody a nice husband. 




 Thinking about it more, I think the answer is this:

You are right, but the only place where the forces count is right at the mouth opening, not at the tip of the noodle. Where I got stuck is thinking that because the noodle is a cylinder, the pressure can only act on the end of the noodle. But in actuality, the pressure is acting on the cross section of the noodle right at the lips and it doesn't matter how long the noodle is.

I'm not 100% on this explanation but it's better than anything else I can think of. 




 Thanks for the diagram and really, thanks for taking all the time to explain. Your diagram is what I was thinking too but I just don't think it's a satisfactory answer. Here's why.

Imagine an *infinite* noodle. If it has no end, this explanation would conclude that an infinite noodle couldn't be sucked into your mouth. Of course, I haven't tested this hypothesis but my gut says that's not the case, that indeed you can keep sucking an infinite spaghetti noodle. Then there's the problem of pushing on the end of a limp spaghetti noodle--I don't think you can make it go where you want it to go.

This is why I threw this up on ELI5. I can't reach a satisfactory explanation by myself. 




 Ya Paint sucks. Google draw is only slightly better but meh, it works for this kind of thing. I sent a request for permission. 




 Because it's in the Constitution. 




 Or rather:

Things don't suck. They blow.

Physics geek t-shirt idea! 




 I understand the beer bottle bursting. I wasn't thinking of the cap or the end but the midsection. the pressure is pushing on the bottle wall. The bottle bursts outward. *I get it.*

Maybe [this will illustrate](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1e24LQwskqeEmaX8R3DhFMYXKXnbaQ4UzBWZu3XJ4EOs/pub?w=960 h=720) my question better than my words thus far.

Edit:  Imagine a piece of paper on a table. For my hand to slide that paper across a table, there must be friction between my hand and the paper. If it were frictionless, I would not be able to move the paper across the table. And that friction is, of course, created by the roughness of my skin and the paper. 




 Oh shit, my ass is on several hard drives. 




 The beer bottles I understand. Its surface is orthogonal to the direction that it bursts. You push on a flat surface, it moves in the direction of the force. How does that translate to the noodle, whose surface is cylindrical but parallel to the direction that it moves? 




 So the air pressure is acting on the roughness of the noodle. *If* the spaghetti noodle had a perfectly smooth surface, you couldn't suck it in, right? 




 Sorry, misspoke. I meant air pressure, not force. 




 That air pressure must have a surface to push on, right? A noodle is cylindrical so there isn't any surface can accept a force which pushes the noodle inward.  Well, except for the very tip of the noodle. 




 ^^^ What he said. I meant *air pressure* forces. 




 Oh boy that's an entirely different beast. Nobody knows how gravity actually works, just that it does. 




 Having a hard time wrapping my head around the "fluid" part. I can push an uncooked spaghetti noodle but have you tried pushing a limp one? Doesn't work so well!

Edit:  Oh you mean like water through a straw? Fluids aren't compressible so if they are constrained in a straw then they can behave like a solid. 




 Edit:  I mean *air pressure* forces can only push, not pull. 




 Even if a solo pianist has played some piece a hundred times, it's never plays the same way twice. The same goes for a good orchestra, but it would all sound like shit if every musician did their own thing, holding some notes longer than before, playing some parts louder or softer than normal. A conductor is needed to be the creative force during a performance. Good musicians are needed who can respond to the conductor's cues and make it all come together. 




 It could be a honeypot as well. 




 HDMI and DVI are both digital video standards but there are two differences that will explain why desktop PCs tend to use DVI rather than HDMI. First, most DVI ports also provide analog signals and HDMI does not. This means you can connect a VGA cable to a DVI port using an adapter. Since many existing monitors are still analog, this was an important design criteria for desktop PCs. 

Second, HDMI carries audio. This is really important for signals going to a TV since all of them have built-in speakers. Most computer monitors, on the other hand, don't have built-in speakers since most PCs use external speaker systems.

There's more demand for HDMI on laptops because people are more likely to plug laptops into TVs since they are more portable. Few people will unplug their tower, keyboard and mouse to take it over to a TV. But you'll notice that even laptops that have HDMI ports will also have a DVI port. (Yes, there are exceptions, I know.) 




 The amount of debt is one piece, interest rates are another, and currency is yet another factor. Debt rating is a measurement of the risk of default. U.S. government debt has one of the best debt ratings in the world. The U.S. dollar is also highly sought because its value is stable. All of these factors make the amount of debt less of a factor to the U.S. than that amount would be to another country who doesn't have as favorable of conditions.

Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing if used well. Let's say you invented the SuperWidget 2000. By yourself, you can make one a day, around 250 a year without working weekends. Let's say a rich uncle saw one of your widgets and is willing to help you grow your business by loaning you money at less than 1% interest to build a factory, buy machinery and hire and train workers to build the SuperWidget 2000. Now you are employing 100 people and building 100 a day. Your income has gone up 20X, thanks to your uncle. You would be crazy to turn down that sub-1% loan. That's exactly what the rest of the world wants to do. U.S. pays interest rates in the 0.1 to 0.3% range on our debt.
 




 Default is when you don't pay. The debt doesn't all mature at once, just like your mortgage that has monthly installments. The U.S. debt has varying lengths. The debt limit is completely made up my Congress.

 I don't have a problem with wanting to believe in God as long as they respect other religions and non-believers. I feel the joy of love as much as anyone else. I hurt as much as anyone else when my mother died. Just because I know that emotions are synapses firing in my brain doesn't make it any less powerful to me. I also feel sympathy for others, no matter what they believe in. To me, it's not religious. It's just being human. If I ever join a religion it would probably be Unitarianism. 




 I apologize if anyone took it that way. That was not my intention. 




 Generally, you're not allowed to shoot somebody unless you can make the case that it's self defense, that you feel your life is being threatened. In most states, feeling that your property was being threatened doesn't rise to that bar, and it certainly doesn't if the person is in the act of fleeing, regardless of whether they are carrying your property. 




 How much time did it take for you to realize that Star Wars was a work of fiction? That's about how much time it took for me to realize the bible was a work of fiction. If you take the position that the bible is a scientific paper consisting of a hypothesis, an experiment and a conclusion then its conclusion would have been shown to be erroneous many times over.

 If you have bought anything, you've paid taxes (at least in most states). If you live somewhere, even if you rent, you pay taxes (your landlord passes these costs to you). If you are employed, even at minimum wages, you pay taxes (your employer withholds these and they also pay employer contributions that you don't see).

If you're an adult, chances are high--very, very high--that you pay taxes. 




 There are a lot of great companies, many started and staffed by some very hard working and entrepreneurial people. That's a big part of the equation but not the only part. One of the reasons why you can earn that money is because taxpayers and government helped create an environment with good infrastructure, regulations and laws that foster and protect free market competition.
