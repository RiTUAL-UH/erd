 I am unsure on who to start,Deric or Ousted.... :\
 




 Captaining BWP for the sake of it :) 









 It is not common in synchro dimension, but the tops and security probably has heard of it like how the top headquarters in every dimension knows about all the other summons.  




 Yes, but not every single one.  




 We should start tolling all highways, so it needs to run a profit.  




 No because only blue state urban folks use Amtrak. Why should rural red state people subsidize something that they don't use? We need to fund and build more highways and airports if we want to use money wisely. ;) 




 You sure these are the best evidence to be against TPP if freetrade has been proven by most economists to be a net benefit for everyone in the GDP sense. 




 Keane and Zardes aren't starting together at the top. Also Landon Donovan is gone, so it should have been expected from last season that LA doesn't have that assist maker threat.  




 Colorado's Postponed game . 




 Should workers be free to move from country to country to get better wages? 




 Economics has a lot of outside factors and can't really be scientific proven. 

Example: Nobody can scientific analyze to the exact point how a minimum wage increase can affect the economy.  




 In capitalism, yes.... it is inherently darwinistic.  




 Labor Particaption was also worse in the 1950s than today's.

One person can easily provide family income.  




 It similar to a budget deficit. We are consuming more than we can afford. 

Revenues = Trade Exports

Spending = Trade Imports

When we say we are exporting more through more jobs, we are increasing the rate of trade exports but ignoring how much trade imports we take in.  




 I agree. Trade is supposed to benefit all parties involved. Nobody should "lose" or have an "advantage". 




 Now, we have a time delay to get back to the original aggregate demand. 




 Those are small compared to the whole equilibrium market, so it doesn't affect equilibrium all that much. 




 So... We should continue on a negative trade balance? What are the benefits of a trade surplus, where we export more than we take in?

In economics, something has to add to zero because nothing is infinite.  




 Question: aren't the workers, who make the items are also a portion of demand, so if they lose their jobs, should demand of the good shift to the left as well? 




 Are there articles by economists that day TPP is a good agreement? I want to read them as well as economists who say that it isn't, even though it is known that trade = benefits everyone. 




 In trade, everybody gains so there shouldn't be any losers. 




 What happens when everything is at world equilibrium with goods, wages, prices, etc?  




 How will TPP address the trade deficit is the main concern? So far our trade policy has increased trade deficits. 




 how about the Mexican economy and it's different sub groups in the economy? Shouldn't trade be a benefit for everyone? 




 The middle-man business will obviously want to buy the cheaper-made good because it is in its best economic decision making. 

What are you trying to lead me into? Opportunity Cost? Comparative Advantage?   




 Ya. I am taking economics right now in college, so I might not be a complete expert on this topic, bur I do enjoy learning about it. If I faced off against a person with "supply side-centric", I will probably lose. However, economics is a "dismal science" as noted in the economics subreddit and it really just depends on your opinions.  




 Not all economists are conservative, but the science relies on a capitalist supply and demand graph. 




 I honestly want to see a debate between economists vs protectionism  




 You sure? Don't they have a lot of evidence that say all freetrade = met gain for everyone? 




 Clarify this please? One person is trying to obtain 1 million orders of f500 vs 1 million of another object?  




 Economics the dismal science  




 next what is the point of national borders if companies, workers, migration, and prices of every good in the world are at world equilibrium?  




 Why are there "trade advantages" if freetrade is a net benefit to everybody involved? There shouldn't be any losers in trade.  




 I wonder why doesn't shifts of the labor supply factor into the equation 




 I have always wondered how would Sanders face against an economist on free-trade's pros and cons? Most say yes to TPP and free-trade.  




 I agree. Other countries have amazing modern infrastructure for public transit, trains, airports, seaports, etc 




 there is a correlation with an increase in trade deficits with an increase in freetrade in the past few decades.  




 Any link to articles? 




 The same logic is similar to perfect competition businesses. One Business can't affect the market's price. They take the market's given equilibrium price.  




 It may be true in a way, but I only stated this because people have been saying that protectionism never works at all, even though it had for decades before the Great Depression.  




 I wonder why the Highway Trust Fund isn't getting major headlines since the deadline is coming up. 




 one person making a change in purchases doesn't really affect the market. You need a massive amount of change by buyers or a change in macroeconomics policy making. 




 protectionism worked in America from the beginning of our founding to the 1920s 









 democrats and republicans had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings. parties used to be regional rather than ideology. 














 Most Businesses don't even run on profit. The ones that do run on profit are large corporations or businesses with ideas/goods that are superior to the current market state. Most small businesses close and file into bankruptcy with a couple of years. 

Most infrastructure systems are natural monopoliess. 




 While we debate an issue of whether to even have intercity train travel, Europe, Japan, South Korea, RUSSIA, CHINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, etc are building miles and miles of rail and in some cities within these regions have better transit than us. 




 This is so ridiculous. We need to increase spending on Amtrak.  




 Why do you have Thunder Sea Horse but no Batteryman AAA? You have only 1 specific name for seahorse. 




 Yes but is is easier for republicans to gerrymander because Democrats live in clustered urban areas and minority dominated areas in the west and south. Republicans have a larger access to land size since they come mostly rural areas, which are very sparse. 




 Yet, America was more socialist when our grandparents were young in the 1930s to 1950s. 

NASA was a socialist program to defeat Soviet Union's Capitalist space program. 

Marginal Income Tax Rates were above 90% on the wealthy.

!950s had the largest infrastructure spending in our nation's history with the interstate highways, which would cost 1/2 to 1 trillion dollars in today's money.  




 fusion recovery is recyclable and a bit less of a dead draw than the other fusion cards. 




 -1 or -2 Quickdraw and replace it with chronomaly golden jet, so galaxy soldier's effect goes off.  




 the effective tax rate would still be larger. if today's effective tax rate is 0% and sometimes negative for wealthy people and corporations, then wouldn't the effective tax rate back then be high? According to this "lots of loopholes" logic, today people are receiving a lot of negative tax rates. 




 Like $15 to $30 depending on the rarity? 




 I thought that conservatives believe that entry level jobs are supposed to be "part time"  




 Ya. Either way, nobody could have really expected Bingham with SJ's below average defense to do well against Houston's offense + Bingham's ability to save a penalty.  




 Don't forget that Houston still faces the Toronto's defense that still isn't great.  




 Giles Barnes :D 




 Same. Though, Deric hasn't been doing so well. It might be the absence of Horst. If we can get Horst to start both games, then I will start Deric.  




 ya. Though I just realized that I have 2 more transfers since I only used 1 last round. I am thinking of replacing subs for a good sub.  









 ishizaki should be on people's radar when Zardes and Keane play as forwards.  




 So this is how we can compete against developing countries. Good job America! 




 Galaxy is good in OTK decks.  




 Madison only wanted a republic to stop the masses of the working class to vote away rights of minorities, who were the wealthy landowners at the time. Minorities didn't mean racial minorities, sexual
Minorities, religious minorities, etc. 




 I rather have a majority rules multiparty proportional system which every developed country has. You think they have mob rule and uninformed citizens and vote away rights of minorities?  




 yet we still claim that we are the least corrupt out of the rest of the developed world 




 Right.... Are Republicans going to talk about their support of free-trade, Patriot Act, drug war, privatizing infrastructure, reducing urban development programs, increasing police officers, etc in Cleveland?

Yes. Those are the "solutions" to solve any urban problem in America. Of course, there are other issues by which they will differ themselves from Baltimore like family values, responsibility, education, etc, but you can expect no talk about any of the major issues above.  




 Should have started Ousted instead fo Deric 




 No Wildcard usage :o 




 Only in America where opposing majority rules is good because conservatives fear that they vote away rights of minorities. What James Madison wanted when he created a republic was to stop the rule of majority against the minority land owners. 




 you have got to be kidding me. James Madison wanted a republic so individuals can think for themselves instead of the majority opinion? 




 Roids 




 I want somebody who isn't centrist Hillary and divisive as democratic socialist Sanders but is still electable to the American Public. 




 Ya. I was planning on that.  




 ^
I know that incentive by Republicans. I want a candidate, who isn't too centrist like Clinton nor too extreme like Sanders, but still can be electable.  




 I don't see any good transfers investments, if I transfer out Arrieta, Villareal and Jacobson. I only transferred out Gehrig for Polster to save 0.2 million and get a more attack-oriented defender. 









 Republicans want a more liberal candidate so they can gain moderates in the general election. 




 you need a way to get rid of common singles first to make up any remaining losses.  




 I don't think Robles is a good investment even after the double game week, so not really. 




 The yugioh community is basically people with a lot of $$$ already. Those people go to locals, regionals, and nationals. Konami already makes a lot from them because they will always buy. There has to be a reason why investors aren't investing in Konami for the TCG yugioh. 




 Honestly it just depends on the consumers of yugioh. We need to expand the market base so konami will make money in America. 




 I wouldn't recommend getting Powers since Colorado's attack isn't that great. Forwards must score if Powers wants to get assists. Then, again, if you have Colorado Players already on your team from past, keep them there because you will never know what the future will hold and you have double the chances. 




 Training Field

Spell Card - Field Spell

You can normal summon "roid" machine-type monsters without tributing. "Roid" Monsters can target their own monsters for attacks. When they do, the attacking monster gains 300 ATK and the battling monsters are not destroyed by battle. If this card is destoryed by a card effect, you can add 1 "roid" card from your deck to your hand. 

I slightly added more effects from the anime version. 




 I know. I am just satirizing the people, who say free-trade will improve enviromental laws. 




 For the past couple of seasons, FC Dallas always starts the season strong and then falters for some reason. 




 I captained FINLAY! :D
 




 Yes. I did. :) 




 Free-Trade helps to introduce competition and increase living standards for everyone on all sides. Why should anybody be concerned about the enviroment, if the economy grows? The freetrade and competition will reduce the negative enviroment externalities.  




 Yes. I said that statement to keep people aware that the Republican Party and some Conservatives didn't always support free-trade during their history and Democrats/ some Liberals used to support free-trade.  




 Yes in a way, but not exactly. Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings.

Democrats purged out their conservative southern faction after the New Deal Coalition and the emergence of the social progressives to the dislike of Southern Democrats. Republicans purged out the Northeastern Liberal Establishment before the 1980s, but began in the 1964 GOP National Conservation, when they don't want moderation at all/hated the Welfare/Big Government (which had grown under 1950s with an increase in marginal income taxes and new spending) 




 I though Conservatives are nationalistic and would oppose free-trade because nations wouldn't live within their means and we would be dependent on other countries for goods and services. Self-Reliance and Personal Responsibility anyone? 




 If free-trade is good for all sides economically, then why don't they just release the trade negotiation details to public before they sign it into law? Is it in secert to ensure US's interests are kept? How? Shouldn't everybody benefit? 




 Keep in mind... Mexico is supposed to increase living standards every year as a result of NAFTA's free-trade. What has happened since then? Drug Cartels, Mass Murders, People still living in shacks, even though they work in manufacturing jobs, pollution in Mexico City, etc. Why are the TPP negotiations in secert, if everybody benefits from trade according to economists? Why do people say that it has to be secert to ensure USA wins a trade? How? i thought in trade... everybody benefits.  




 The Republican Party used to be the party of high tariffs and protectionism. Keep in mind, the US economy was reliant on protectionism until 1920s. During that time, we went through a huge industrial boom. Yes, protectionism was also one of the causes of the World Wars.  




 cool! I never knew that he did this AMA before, so ya. :) 




 Syrus Truesdale with better roids to face off again Yugo's Speedroids 




 What is your favorite yugioh deck? 




 True, but I mean as a result of the political forces.......you had more globalization of the markets, since the 1970s.  




 I know, but basic economics say yes. Also, most economists during the period of 1980 to 2008 agreed that it worked. Right now, most economists still believe free-trade is a good thing. How is not viable? Where are the supposed "economists" who can debate the issue of trade, inequality, taxes, and amount of government spending? 




 It is really a toss-up. Deric seems to be getting a lot of bonus points, even if he doesn't get clean sheets. 




 Isn't trade a good thing? According to economists, all free-trade deals are good economically.  




 Shouldn't the a more freemarket economics, deregulation, a reduction in government services (to reduce deadweight losses) help to expand the economy and reduce inequality during that time? After all, we expanded free-trade, lowered taxes, reduced the size of the government spending, spent more on military, etc? '
