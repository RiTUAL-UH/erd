 Literally worse than Pao.  




 I don't know if it's true or not, but it might be. Better be careful or one of the Nazi mods might b  you! 




 I would respond with some stupid shitty response mocking the outrage about FPH's ban, but there's no way I could be ridiculous enough to out-shitty those people... 




 [Here's a pretty scathing rebuttal of Soon's most recent co-authored study.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jun/03/research-downplaying-impending-global-warming-is-overturned)  




 Lol I wish it were that easy! 




 I can't think of a single agency that doesn't use the term

That's the point! Southern Company isn't a common, public, or unbiased funding source. They're a company. Their motive isn't uncovering scientific truths, it's making money. (Yes, companies fund lots of perfectly good science. Clearly that is not the case here.) 

And it's not a "we're too stupid" defense, it's a "you're too smart" one. 




 Not to get into a whole thing here, but...uh...[remember Sandy](https://www.google.com/search?site= tbm=isch source=hp biw=1038 bih=893 q=Sandy+NYC+underwater oq=Sandy+NYC+underwater gs_l=img.3...5657.8552.0.8746.20.10.0.9.0.0.303.919.6j2j0j1.9.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..12.8.614.4MvcdDFQvN4)?

Because I do. In fact, I remember seeing the road in front of my apartment so flooded that when the waters finally receded, there was a ~10 lb Atlantic Cod flapping around on a sewer drain.   




 I get what you're saying, I'm not disagreeing. I'm telling you that you're expecting the media to operate as though they're publishing PhD's, and expecting the public to understand things like publishing PhD's. It's just unrealistic. 

The focus on the term is just a heuristic. No, it's not technically 100% accurate. No, it's not the key issue. *It's just a symbol that people can understand.* 

Having the slightest idea what you're reporting on

I hate to tell you, only the most experienced and educated reporters have any clue what they report on. If you'd like to change that, convince more PhDs to stop writing peer-reviewed studies and start writing for the public.

Something that most PhDs don't know and always have a hard time dealing with: mainstream media is written for an 8th grade reading level. 

Let that sink in. 8th grade. 

That's the standard you can to hold them to.  




 the use of the term 'deliverable' in no way implies such a relationship. 

I mean...it kind of does though, if the other option is that there's no relationship at all. It isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the study was done on the company's behalf. Which means he's not independent, and he should declare the funding. 

What is the purpose of paying attention to their coverage, when they admittedly have absolutely no idea what they are doing?

Then don't. If you demand perfection you'll always be disappointed, and you can go ahead and stop doing anything outside the ivory tower.  




 [Make it happen people!](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=sloths+are+slowbears)  




 A billion Catholics would beg to differ... 




 Yes. Wouldn't have helped the fact that they've been debunked, but it would at least make him honest.  




 I guess I should have added that he claims to be independent, but if it's a study for a company in exchange for funding, then it's not really independent. Right? 

I just think you're holding the public media to a higher standard than they're ever going to meet. You can't expect the public/media to understand the details of publishing. Of course it'd be nice if they followed science as closely as pop culture, but that's just unrealistic, you know?   




 For the most part whatever public institutions or private universities they work in...  




 Except Gore's not publishing studies without disclosing that funding. 

So you've inadvertently made the opposite point you tried to. This shows that Soon's not a scientist, he's an advocate.  




 I hear you, but that's kind of the point. The fact that he considers them deliverables but *failed to disclose that to the journals* is the problem. 

Though you're right, journalists/editors are going to use that term as a shorthand for the public.  




 Is there any indication his work is biased or fraudulent?

Yes. He's been debunked repeatedly by scientists who aren't being paid by fossil fuel companies.

 Oh not to worry, you got it!  




 /r/fatfishhate 




 "business as usual scenario" would not, it assumes a continuing reliance on fossil fuels. 

But some of them would, yes. They tend to do a range of emission scenarios, from no clean energy to mostly clean energy, to mostly clean energy and some carbon capture and sequestration, to all clean energy and carbon capture and sequestration.  




 lol, Daily Mail. I wouldn't be surprised if they started sourcing us for the "facts" in their "news"! 

(Also, keep submitting, these two were great!) 




 Umm...just to verify, you know the "shitty" in the sub name is because all of these facts are made up nonsense, right? Not a judgement of whether or not it's an amazing "fact"?

 [Hey bby!](http://i.imgur.com/uzcU6ym.gif) 




 Exarctly. If I thought people would actually get into it here, I wouldn't have mentioned it. 

But it was a busy morning and I'm all out of fresh sloth photos so I just grabbed one from my album and went with the first thing that came to mind!   




 http://i.imgur.com/bgKgdxj.gifv 




 Just stay out of /all and you'll be alright! (And I feel a little bad for bringing the drama into /r/sloths...)

 OMG SO EXCITED! 

When it arrives I might have to take it on a tour and get some pictures of the Sloth in the City in the City! 














 We should! I actually just worked with Running on something else, I'll shoot him an email!

I DVR'd Bloodsport this weekend, gonna watch that tomorrow methinks... 




 You've seen Kung Fu Hustle, right?! If not, drop what you're doing, build a time machine, travel back far enough to find a Blockbuster, and rent Kung Fu Hustle.  




 Young Jackie Chan is the only person who's more entertaining a fighter. His Drunken Master is [great just by itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Hf8l_TUaU), but a whole lot of fun to watch [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OBuMA2qEk).  




 Me too! Just the right amount of style to his fighting. 

Check your TV and see if you have the El Rey channel. It's a weird channel that's mostly kung fu movies and stuff from the 80s, but branded around Mexican wrestling because that's the only original programming it does. 




 Yus. This is my favorite one yet. Perfect! 

(Helps that I've seen the movie recently.) 




 Tell me about it! I went to Coney Island last Sunday and got a little burned after laying out for just a little bit. Then the next day I went to work without a sweater and about froze!  




 Yes, people who mine and burn the dirtiest fuels will need to find new jobs. Which, as the quote in the title points out, will be outnumbered at least 2 to 1 by the new jobs created. 
 




 More technically, it looks like a shortnose batfish, or Ogcocephalus nasutus.

No idea why that big nose is considered short, but I hope that helps! 




 I would if I could, but this is an old image I had in my imgur, that I probably pulled from Pinterest. 

TBH I only knew it was a batfish because I posted the image here 9 months ago with a different title... 




 Hey, if /u/foieymcfoie can get google to autofill a group of chameleons is a starship, I think I should be able to make slowbears a thing! 




 Really? Because last time I heard it, yomamma was so ugly I had to repress the memory! 




 It's not just for the sake of jobs, it's rebutting the industry talking point that regulations destroy jobs. 

Because yes, what you're referencing is the Broken Window fallacy, and it's not exactly good policy.  




 Oh yes, think of the gas companies! We would hate to put a dent in the profits of the richest companies in the world! Heaven forbid they earn anything less than a bazillion dollars for their product that's polluting the atmosphere!

Privatize profits and socialize losses, that's what I always say! Yay corporate socialism!  




 Right, because businesses just up and quit when the EPA regulated lead in gas. 

Businesses just up and quit when the Montreal Protocol phased out aerosols and coolants. 

Business just up and quit when we ended child labor. 

Oh wait, they didn't? And that's just the fearmongering every industry does every time there's a threat of regulation? Oh, hmm.  




 If Slowbears could get popular enough to catch on in google, 

I would be soooooo happy.  




 Batfish, which is actually pretty rare.  




 What's funny about the most recent point on a long-term trend line showing a clear forcing being relevant, while pointing to a short term fluctuation isn't? 

One's evidence of the continuation of a longer trend, the other isn't.  








































































































 Lol, my /r/shittyanimalfacts trickery apparently knows no bounds!  




 I'd guess his intention is to make that 165 million a tactical advantage.  




 [Oh yes, 670,000 coal deaths in China in 2010.](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1632163/670000-deaths-year-cost-chinas-reliance-coal?page=all)  




 Yes but was it propeller-powered? :P  




 Yeah that part confused me too. I'm guessing it's something to do with their personalities and the larger narrative of them "just" being farmers.  




 I hate ol' anal froth as much as the next guy, but this just makes me pity him. That's just sad.   




 It's got 3 hours of battery life, so unless it's a big-ass lake you should be alright!
