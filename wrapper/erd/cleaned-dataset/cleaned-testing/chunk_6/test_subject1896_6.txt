 Hey, you should give her (him?) a guest compliment at City Hall (or at Chamber of Commerce at DCA). It would really make their day, I'm sure.
 




 Whoa, did you just call me YOLO? 




 Wow. I'm extremely humbled by this. That's my tweet. I started posting my tweets in Nov to get feedback on my jokes and reddit has been very kind to me. Seeing someone else post my own tweets is so crazy. 
To clarify, I work at Disneyland and teenagers run rampant through the park and say YOLO. All. The. Time.

Thanks again Reddit.

 Thanks everybody! Email sent. Will follow up.  




 If this somehow gets front page, I get to send him the same email.  




 I'm sorry people downvoted you. I thought this was very funny.  









 What movie were you watching? 




 "You may wonder why I've brought you all here today." 









 I had to exit at "What was your name again?" 




 Fuck your title.  




 My mind awoke before my body did. I lay motionless, lacking memory, afraid to peel back my own eyelids to face my reality. One eye opens: pitch black darkness. The other eye follows and soon and I realize that... *could I still be... in the coffin*? I rack my brain for memories... why is it so hard to remember? The wood above my head is cracking from the weight above-- I'm underground. Rapidly, more dirt fills the empty space around me. I try to fight back. *Is this how I die? In the pitch, dark, blackness....?* 




 RE: bitch comment- To be fair, he did buy her a dog collar (picture).  




 FUCK 




 Are.. are you... the teenage boy I saw? 




 Extremely good point. This explains all my bicuriosity as a young ma-... I mean... 




 If only they all knew the rule you speak of. Can't count how many annoying ass middle-of-the-mall workers try and stop me for teeth whitening, hair straighteners, ground-breaking makeup, breast lifters... and I'm a man. 




 DAE Reddit? (philosophical question) 




 She hopes it will show up as merely a blemish on her record.  




 Did someone say... [Hardy](http://i.imgur.com/s0ukI.jpg)? 




 DAE HARD? 




 HOW HARD BRO?  




 Here's a link to the post this is a reply to for all y'all who don't REDDIT HARD ENOUGH.

 Chapman actually.  




 Very correct. The Mouse doesn't give me any time off when I really want it and doesn't give me any hours when I really need them. It's a great place to work... but I can't say it's worth the trouble during holidays.  




 Certainly not for humans, absolutely not for arbors.  




 Sorry for the shit quality. I made it on my POS phone.  




 I work at Disneyland and the busiest time is during Christmas.  




 Definitely didn't give off any sort of attitude regarding me working on holidays. I'm pretty positive that it's an innocent and simple plea to ask people to remember to be courteous to those offering a free service to keep them safe during holidays.  




 Also, please remember not to be a fucking dick to the dude that tows you. He is working on NYE to drive your sloppy ass around.
