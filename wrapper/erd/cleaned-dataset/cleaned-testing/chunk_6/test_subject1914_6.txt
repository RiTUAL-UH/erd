 exactly thats what i thought. I'm just going to spam it to every channel until i at least get a response. this might sound dumb but how do i go about copyrighting it. is there a form i have to fill out or something. I'm not really in the industry yet so i don't know what the procedure is.  




 and how would i go about representation. would someone approach me or would i have to go to them 




 thanks for the advice. i might just start sending to the companies BBC ITV etc 




 a bit confused as to what to do next. 




 the deepest fear speech in coach carter. 




 aston martin DB5. i wish i was james bond

 i want to be  writer I'm very insecure about my creative energy and i wonder if i have what it takes to make it in life. i also have drastic mood swings and it makes me wonder wether i have some kind of mental illness

 Okay so I'm going into my third year and uni and I'm moving into university housing which means living with 5 other students. now i have a problem with small talk and I'm really scared about living with new people for the first time in a few years. and this sounds really dumb but how do i create a polite and friendly atmosphere when people are talking to me i have big trouble with first impressions and small talk anyway even though i have the best intentions in mind. any tips 

P.S this is not a self deprecating post to get compliments or anything i genuinely need help at being friendly and sociable. thanks a lot 




 my kids only 22 and he's already nearly better than yours ;)

 walking my dog when its quite and theres nobody around 




 pretending to be dumb 




 i love the opening credits in grease. i just love grease if I'm gonna be honest  




 well. its a funny story actually my and my family went on holiday to florida and when we were there we went to one of these places where you can swim with dolphins and you do this in groups of 7 and in my family theres 5 of us. just by pure chance tom felton and his girlfriend were with us and me and my mum couldn't resist saying a few shit jokes like when he was swimming with the dolphin my mum went 'Come on your a wizard this shouldn't be a problem' which he gave us a polite chuckle lame shit comments like that really :).   




 say a wizard pun to tom felton and made him sigh.  




 amazing film ! 




 #barebantznolistsfornobodyyolo2014  




 i think we've found a 14 year old. 




 holy shitting fuck stick ! 




 yeah school did that for a lot of kids :(. really sad in a way 




 completely agree on your first point. just to clarify here i love to read I'm not saying reading is bad I'm just saying a lot of people like to say they read maybe to seem smart or maybe because they are worried they have no character or something i don't know but I'm saying people like to tell other people they read. but fiction isn't overrated don't be stupid  




 i love to read as well. but the amount i hear at uni from girls mostly trying to pass of they love art and reading and it just bugs me a bit. 




 yeah i meant reading books. obviously  




 switch to controversial  if you want real unpopular opoinons  




 reading. tons of people pretend they like to read.  




 Thats complete bullshit. 




 god damm this whole album was amazing. franks voice is so tasty  




 at least she admitted it. gotta give her credit for that seen to many videos like this when the person at fault just gets more angry  




 sweet self-depricating post for instant karma. cunt  




 the door to our kitchen has a gate on it. A kind of gate you put on to stop toddlers and babys and stuff anyway my chocolate lab walks into the gate daily and he just cant get his head around the concept of a gate he just doesn't understand how he can see through but not get through. its adorable the big dummy  




 maybe they should tell you your money is going into people pockets rather than the cause they have been told then. 




 I'm under no illusions there cringy and horrible but fuck it there funny as shit to me and I'm a want to be a writer as well what does that make of my sense of humour ? 




 firstly i love cheesy comedy one of the reasons i love pierce brosnan as bond was because of the lines e.g i thought christmas only comes once a year. but i just like kevin bacon and stupid cheesy crap jokes 









 someone could win. is not about being financially responsible here in the uk it costs 2 i mean i know the odds and such but its possible my numbers can come up and for the excitement and dream its worth it. hey i could spend that 2 quid on a ticket and have the 'what if' feeling or i could buy another drink at lunch plus the lottery funds some great stuff over here i mean the freaking science museum is lottery funded so even if you don't win your doing a bit of good thats how i see it 




 im glad everyone is annoyed with this problem aswell  




 good point actually  




 i always thought a lot of him I'm stupidly rich and i like to reward my key players with good contracts. this kids always been a stand up fella he's hurt me Deji29... he's hurt me  




 so dumb this better get fixed. i mean it would be more realistic if the player said ' i want to live in france where it would be better for my family' that i can understand but not ambitious enough come on ! 




 t.v in the bathroom, watching grease in the bath with a beer would be the dream. p.s yeah i like grease and what ! 




 the funny thing is is that i offered him a new contract and he's totally willing to negotiate. sometimes this game is just plain dumb  




 i hear you brother  




 yeah i understand its just annoying. like i have won everything multiple times and he says its because ambition bloody stupid.  














 pencil skirts and glasses. or i good sundress  




 its not underrated its just shit 




 weird how she keeps saying she's a legitimate actress and her beauty prevents her from getting roles then choses a role when she wears a skin tight suit throughout.
