 I'm really surprised this isn't a thing or at least an option. Lets sell our own brand of needles with this on them. We just need a sweet name. 









 Well you can fuck right off then. Everyones thinking it 




 Did you also do the video editing? I do street art and video. Just curious if you also did the video too. Nice soundtrack btw. 




 That was good, thanks 




 I'm sorry but this... (From #12) "In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone." is the most false and ignorant statement ever.

 Yes, in the rare and right context but women can also use these in very evil ways. Are you a women? If you are you just wouldnt get it...
 









 Yes true, but it says they only had a glimpse of it. Just enough time to see something and jump to conclusions. Then question everything you know. 




 Is it not possible a person went skydiving, gilding, or something similar without reporting it first? The other 2 thoughts I had was it could be a R/C Plane or kite (yes Very high, but still. Look at the link). Or a metor in the shape of a person. [Example 1](http://techgeeze.techgeezecom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/superman-rc-plane.jpg) [Example 2](http://static.ibnlive.in.com/pix/slideshow/06-2013/the-superman-plane/main-1-supermanplane-280613.jpg) 














 Believe it or not that was a mechanical pencil. Look real close. 




 This was an assignment when I was in college film school. The person is not me in the video, hes a friend of mine. This was shot about 5 years ago. The assignment was to combine video and music together so they complement each other.  




 Damn that took a lot of work to get that shot. The lighting had to be just right. Pain in the ass for less than a second of screen time. 




 The use of slow motion and speeding up shots really helped in giving it that real feel. 




 Yea that's my favorite shot. I was constantly spraying my friends face with a spray bottle of water to keep the cold sweat look going. 




 Yea It fits really well 









 One of her I did awhile back... [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/XgnQPwQ.jpg) 




 Another one of my favorite songs by them. Thanks for posting this. 














 Yea for sure. I have been using streamers lately but they do hit hard but like you said its worth it when you don't want to loose it. Ive been using OpenRocket and it really gives you a lot of info I can use for better launches. Thanks a lot for recommending that! 




 Thanks for your advice. Your definitely right about there being to many variables to be able to predict landing area. I was hoping there was some equation where you input thrust, height, and wind speed and come up with a 10X10 foot estimate. But like you said, it wouldn't be something you could do on the fly. 




 I'm looking for some basic math on how to figure out where my rocket will land (with or without parashoot) Right now I'm using basic C6-5 Estes motors so I can look up all the statistics online for the thrust. Any advice would be appreciated.   




 Nobody cares about your birthday.  




 What a waste of time watching this. THIS IS NOT FUNNY! AT ALL! 




 Why is this funny?
 




 Agreed. Those titties took me by surprise. 




 Its not. downvotes all around. 









 You can actually visualize sound traveling in this gif. As people are hearing GO! it takes a moment for sound to travel to someones ears. So the people in the front go first and everyone else follows. 





























 Agreed. poetic and insightful. It must have took awhile to write it.

 I can see this dude being about 400 pounds with no neck and a learning disability.  




 Or maybe its a trap to keep selfi taking, duck faced people off the streets. 




 That a good point. I feel like we would break them if we told them that. Their face would get a permanent confused look forever.
