  When you destroy secular dictatorships in Iraq, Libya and Syria, the result is Islamic State extremists. When you depose a duly elected government in Egypt, the result is Islamic State extremists. Seems no matter which way you turn the wrench, it ratchets to the same position. 




 I do not understand your criteria for inclusion. If my strident commentary is considered a violation of reddiquette, I can adjust to community standards. Please clarify. 




 The ongoing catastrophe at Fukushima gets little media coverage, considering how central it is to the critical issue of a sustainable industrial future. Many hail nuclear power as necessary alternative to fossil fuels, with which even James Lovelock could concur. While Germany has prudently decided to decommission its nuclear reactors, aging units stud much of the developed world. The disaster at Fukushima was a Black Swan event, where a mega-earthquake produced a tsunami sufficient to top a seawall and drown the backup diesel generators necessary to cool the offline reactors. Japanese have great technical prowess, but failed in due diligence. What then, can we expect as less meticulous nations, especially China, proceed on the nuclear pathway at full bore?

I grant that this article by Robert Hunziker, posted first to the Counterpunch.org and now forwarded to Oilprice.com by Zero Hedge, comes via two sources that tend toward hyperbole. Likewise, Dr. Helen Caldicott has stood in the anti-nuclear pulpit for decades, foretelling imminent disaster  but Cassandra did prove to be accurate. Some facts are not in dispute. Three nuclear reactors melted down and these are still leaking large quantities of radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean. Four years on, the status (or even the precise location!) of the melted cores is poorly understood, and though many billions have been spent on the cleanup effort, full containment of the radioactive waste could take decades  that is, if the means are found to do so. See this related item http://phys.org/news/2015-06-small-robot-interior-fukushima-daiichi.html. Robots get fried -- yes indeed. We do not need robotic chauffeurs, what we need is superhero robot.
 









 Shuddering is justified. How have the Western publics allowed this shit-fest to recur? Granted, we suffer distraction from the debacles of Iraq, Libya, Syria, et al; through continuous, economic corrosion; by our daily witness of the accelerating destruction of the biosphere  but in permitting our leadership to resume the Cold War, we have abdicated the last of our civic responsibility. What is most disturbing about Max Fishers rambling explainer is not the catalogue of mutual intrusions, threats and policy shifts by the opposing camps, it is his one-sided assumptions of culpability. Russia (or Putin) is aggressive. Putin (or Russia) is paranoid. While the military colossus that attempts to bestride the world is the USA. The Russians do not arm Mexico; why is the new Ukrainian Finance Minister a lobbyist from Chicago? I see Russia as being realistic in preserving its national interests. As is typical of Americans (including myself), Fishers analysis is lacking in historical context. I will spare the reader my amateur recounting of the past century, but for two salient points  the Soviet Union was a failed and murderous vehicle for the preservation of the Russian Empire, and most of these new members of NATO were either minor allies or extensive collaborators with the Nazis in their genocidal war against the Russian people. (Poland is an exception; however, if not the Red Army, many more Poles would have perished in the death camps.) Why do we stir the ashes to rekindle so much hatred?

I find it laughable that Max Fisher seems critical of German pacifists. Rightly, Germany understands that Russia is now their vital economic partner, for an exchange of manufactures for resources, and perhaps, from experience, they are not as sanguine as he is of the success of a NATO blitzkrieg capturing Moscow. I do hope our generals do not expect something similar to our romp into Bagdad. Equally astounding is his characterization of Eisenhower as the reluctant nuclear warrior. He should read the recent history by Evan Thomas, Ikes Bluff  its thesis is that in the event of any Soviet (or Chinese) aggression, the grinning Ike threatened (intended) to respond with a nuclear first strike, an all-out massive retaliation. He did not believe in limited war. Thomas suggests that ulterior purpose of the Interstate Highway System was to facilitate the evacuation of major U.S. cities in advance of our nuclear attack.

While avoiding any criticism of the reckless expansion of NATO, or our creation of a failed Ukrainian state, Fisher seems almost glib in presenting scenarios for nuclear disaster. However, the article is a valuable warning of the stakes of the approaching US elections. The thought of another idiot, reckless Bush brother or the vapid, jet-setting Mrs. Clinton (she of the Russian reset button prop) as the next Commander-in-Chief should really make us shudder. Let us hope that both Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders make respectable showings, and their campaigns become the nuclei for an effective, dual opposition to all of these mad geopolitical adventures.
 




 Being deficient in financial and technical resources, I do use Microsoft products, and while they have steadily improved over the decades, they have typically been the opposite of innovative. Of all the technology tycoons, the founder of Microsoft is least capable of meeting an urgent need in high risk investments in breakthrough technologies  should you need an underperforming knock-off to force on a captive consumer, only then he is your man. Nor does his miracle of the automobile metaphor inspire confidence  that implies relying on a consumer and market driven solution to the Carbon Crisis, albeit one generously larded with public subsidies. Mr. Gates has been a public booster of the works of Vaclav Smil, but seems to have missed one of the professors vital points  the infrastructure of energy production and distribution are enormous investments built over decades. As eleiti cites above, what is required is a massive, crash program, and a consortium of the principal, and principled, governments must take the lead of it. The World Wars offer parallels, but the scale and stakes of this enterprise dwarfs the scale of those efforts.

In his most analytical mode, Mr. Gates must understand this, yet his intellect has one pathological drive  he covets status. This is why he built a voracious and innovation killing monopoly, and the Gates and Wife Foundation exists to perpetuate this egotistical quest  I expect that the Taj Mahal too, avoided estate taxes. Income derived from fossil fuels is a reliable prop for his Foundation, and should others divest from these industries, that also could undermine his eponymous, good works  an astronomical cost indeed. 

Attention Mr. Gates  all that you covet will not long survive you. Sell all that you have and give it to those who are willing and capable to do what is necessary. Achieve that noble fame, or alternatively, you can continue to be an asshole.
