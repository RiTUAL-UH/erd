 Hows it going so far friend? 




 It exists and you WILL get to it. Imagine how incredible it will be. Finally feeling content and free. You have to put your heart and soul into climbing out of hell. Practice meditation. Seek psychiatrists. Do everything you can. You get one life. Its worth fighting for even for 10 minutes of bliss at the end.  




 Haha. I also always get really existential and upset with the idea of non-existence at night. Don't worry, its usually a night thing and tomorrow morning you will feel fresh and fine.

Watch any Alan Watts video on death and it will make you feel a lot better. Death isn't something to be afraid of. Realise that you are the universe. 




 Hey! Don't worry you will be fine. Go make a glass of water and fill it to the brim with ice. Make it so cold it almost hurts to drink and then drink it. 

Relax...It's only an exam. You are not dying. Imagine you have been fighting a war for the last 5 years. A gruesome horrific war. And all of a sudden teleported to you right now about to take an exam. You think that person would care about taking this exam? Who cares if you fail its only an exam. Of course you'll do your best but it doesn't matter if you don't. 

Also change your mind from "I'm going to fail this exam" to "I'm gonna do as much as I can to pass"  




 Is it night time where you are now?  




 Yeah I completely see where you are coming from. You should work really hard in the next few days and try and get into med school then (but with the mind-set that no matter what happens you will still be happy). Don't under-estimate yourself. Of course it's not an ideal situation but its still possible. Do what you can with the cards in your hand :) 




 As a 19 year old guy who is a HUGE game of thrones fan. I can 100% tell you that your boyfriend does not watch it for the boobs. Also the first few episodes may make you feel like there is always nudity but it really gets less and less frequent as the show goes on and got more popular. The show is amazing and you should absolutely watch it if you are interested.

I think the real issue here that you need to address is the  fact that you get jealous at the thought of him looking at boobs. There was a really good video posted a while back where the guy explains scientifically why a guy might look at another girls breasts as its biologically programmed in men but also that literally 95% of the time if you were to ask them about that girl later on in the day they wouldn't even remember them. A guy is biologically programmed to look at breasts. Yes he might have a "hah boobs!" moment for about 5 seconds but after that he will forget about them and in no way should you feel jealous because he wants to be with you!

I'll actually try and find the video because it was really interesting.  




 Sucks that you are stressed! Exam season is always the worst. Nikosi Johnson said Do all you can with what you have, in the time you have, in the place you are. Whenever I feel bogged down with feeling like i'm "too late" or I've "run out of time" I change my perspective to one based off of this quote. It's not about what you haven't done in the past but what you can do now. Imagine you have a clean slate now and your just going to try your hardest in the time you have. Almost imagine a God-like deity coming down and controlling the body of kirbias for the next 4 days. Ask yourself what they would do in that situation and do it. 

Also, from my own personal experience. Don't panic and work extremely long hard hours and burn out. Work smarter, not harder. Stay hydrated, energised and happy. Take regular breaks and study in small 20 minute bursts. Also look up the syllabuses or previous exam papers and see what questions/topics are most likely to come up. 

Most importantly though, relax. Although exams can seem extremely important at the time, almost as if your whole life revolves around the next week or so, this is not the case. If I were to ask your older self about that stressful exam period you would either not remember it or say that you wish you weren't so stressed at such a prime, young and happy part of your life! :) 




 Once you're out you'll feel better! The sun is amazing for making you feel good but you have to actually leave the house for it to have an affect on you. Within 10 minutes you'll feel great. Go ride! :) 




 I play enhancement shaman and hunter, always nice to speak to fellow wow players :) 




 Also, when you do feel up for doing some of these tasks, do them one at a time. Don't look at it like "oh no I have all of this to do how am I gonna do it!?". Get a piece of paper and physically write one thing that you are going to do at a time and take it slowly. Break down complicated goals like "I'm going to get a job" into individual steps. It doesn't matter how minuscule these steps or progress is as long as you are making progress no matter how small it is! :)
