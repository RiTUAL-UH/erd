 I would take you out anywhere your heart desires 3 




 Apparently, in the future, global warming has clearly flipped the earths seasons on it's head. What we used to know as wintry Christmas time, is now the prime season for a tropical vacation, full of beach parties and sunbathing. I wonder if they still have presents. 




 Omg, you are too cute. I love your makeup, I love your hair, I love your socks. You are precious  




 I know a person who will be looking for a roommate come August or September. Who loves reading, Netflix, knitting, and art; and who's boyfriend loves tabletop gaming, lol. House will be with two other people in their mid-late 20s, 1 male, and 1 female. You will have your own room, and possibly your own bathroom. How do you feel about dogs? 




 Now that deserves a salute 




 Oh, haha. Well, regardless, you're still the cutest thing ever :) 




 You should check out a game called Hero Academy 




 Yes, yes they do ;) 




 If I was attracted to them, and we had chemistry, yes.
