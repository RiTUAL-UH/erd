 I'm all for agreeing that the sky isn't falling, but this is still something to take note of:  A customer did something that sling doesn't like, *and they noticed*.  Then, sling *terminated their account*.

Depending on what the customer originally did, or what services they were using, this could be the start of something significant.

 You knew the context I was saying that in.  Being an ass calls for necessity.  Dont just give it away. 




 Actually, it was in 1999 (I was in Paris for Y2K stuff), and this was by far the smallest car I had ever seen in my life.  These didnt exist in any major cities in the US.  How can you not comprehend that back in 2001 (although I really was thinking of 1999), a car like this was not known by a majority of the American population?

Does that make some sense of it for you? 




 Yep.  I first encountered a Smart Car in Paris back in 2001.  As an American, I could not understand what I was looking at. 




 This article if force-feeding bullshit to the masses.

1. Fury is not a character of any importance in the Civil War story.
1. SLJ has a 9-movie deal at a certain rate. To force the Fury character into Civil War for no good reason would be a total waste of that contracted rate, and make a later movie cost more due to contract negotiations. 




 Fuck selective breeding.

 Its not clear if the movie is following the canon of the comics here, as they never really address it.  But in an earlier movie we see the image of the [comic] Phoenix Force move through the water at Lake Alkali(sp?).  So, a lot of us see that as the Phoenix Force coming to her to save her - showing it as a separate and self-conscious entity, like in the comics.

edit: grammar  




 Oh god yea, the mods at TheTVDB are horrible.  They could easily track/present information in multiple ways, but instead they give everyone a big *fuck you thats why*. 




 Journalists are writers, and they have to paint~~s~~ pictures of stories with words.  The kid was an honor student.  That's his most recent claim-to-fame.  Its completely reasonable to refer to him as that. 




 Its a joke, because you are being overly defensive.  I'm sorry that you dont get it.  You still need to take a break from the conversation. 




 Exactly.  The only thing saving Logan is his fast healing-factor counteracting being torn apart (I don't even think his adamantium figures into this).  Nothing else on his person should be surviving the onslaught. 




 Because [in the comic books] the phoenix force isnt a mutant ability.  Its a "cosmic" entity/power that takes over people.  Part of Jean's ability to control it as long as she did was relying on her mutant mental powers. 




 WAITRESS:  Doesn't matter.  Got tip. 




  You need to realize that not every situation a cop is forced into is going to end up with the cop doing the wrong thing.

And no one is saying it is.  You're getting really defensive really quick.  Maybe you need to take a break officer. 




 Because it portrays him as a "good" person, that would likely not partake in a criminal activity worthy of being shot over.  When telling a story, in any medium, these are things people want to know.  Its interesting, and its how you tell a narrative as a writer.

With that said, as far as I have heard so far, all this kid was is drunk and belligerent.

I'd love to know why he was shot and killed. 




 This is pretty much the one thing that dissapoints me about 3.33.  I only give it a pass because I realize that a lot of time has passed since Misato last saw Shinji.  She has clearly seen some shit.

But, as a fan and a viewer of the rebuilds, it is seriously annoying to not have a better understanding as to just wtf has tarnished everyone's attitudes so much.

 




 I think this is an otaku version of a newish womens-fashion thing I recently started seeing infomercials for.  The "thing" is this band-like fabric that wraps your torso and goes over your pants.  The main thing about it is that if you have a short shirt, if you bend over of whatever, you wont expose your midriff.  If you crouch, you wont expose your panties/whale-tale.

I dunno wtf you call it, but its some sort of modesty apparel, so you can still dress in trampy styles, but not expose your undies. 




 I loved it.  But I can understand the hate, especially if you weren't expecting a massive divergence from the original storyline/timeline. 




 You're partially correct, and I have corrected my original response.

 Its not a matter of voltage.  Its a matter of size.  The size is a lie. 




 Its a good thing that Americans cant read sideways print! 




 I recommend 2-3 max.  It can be dangerous going alone with no one to watch for police, and particularly; no one to watch you back from miscreants.

Anything over two, I recommend that you have some distance between each other.   Any additionally paired people that are standing close to each other can appear suspicious.  What looks normal walking down the street or otherwise hanging out, does not look normal behind a building or in the shadows. 




 Behind every huge white box is a BBC. 




 Thanks for the re-education on this. Amazing how memories can be distorted over time.  I recalled buying the colored graphic novels before seeing the movie in the US.

No doubts that the original first-run manga was b/w. 




 I've been really enjoying it - and I didnt think that I would going in.  Half-way through the first season I found myself thinking to myself, "This is like a great version of TLOEG.  I wonder what Alan Moore thinks of this". 




 How odd.  I thought I was already watching a new series/reboot of The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen...  it's called Penny Dreadful, and its on Showtime. 




 Clearly, you are done with the internet, and should see yourself out.

 Are you sure about that?  Because the one I owned (25+ volumes) was not printed by Marvel, and they actually cut english-language production before the US run was completed - with the remainder released in B W and on much lower-quality stock. 




 you cannot "stream" without transcoding.  If you want to direct-play subtitles, you can - typically if the subtitle is in a separate file, *and your Plex client supports it*.

As an example, my Samsung TV can direct-play .srt (SubRip) subtitles.  So when I use Plex on my local lan, I make efforts to never have to stream/transcode, and am able to direct-play everything. 




 TIL they are related. 




 You ain't got no lube, Lt. Dan!

 The movie HAD to pull out all stops artistically, because the comic was a top-notch digital-color very high-quality graphic novel.  At the time, it was the most beautiful comic I had ever seen.  I didnt even know that level of "comic" quality was possible at the time. 




 The original comic in Japan was huge (in length/depth) in comparison to the movie.  I was shocked they did as well as they did. 




 I love this sub. 




 Although he approached it incorrectly, to give him the benefit of the doubt, he may be attempting to prevent his own liability against sexual harassment.  By this, I mean, he has to constantly observe his students for their physical behavior.  He was to watch for posture, as well as foot/leg/arm/hand positioning.  As a man, I can only imagine this leaves him open to accusations of lecherous behavior.

I dont think there is any "right way" to approach this with him, aside from genuine honesty.  He used stereotypical male humor to approach an issue, that unfortunately perpetuates a sexual bias.  If he seems sincere, it may be better to just let it slide.  Not everyone is an expert in political correctness, nor is every situation an appropriate teaching moment.

Again - only if he seem to be genuinely sincere in his policy reasons, I would approach this after-the-fact, with him directly or to his employer.  Doing anything during will only add to the discomfort of the situation, and continue to downgrade your paid-for learning experience.

Thinking on it more, I wouldn't approach this with him directly.  I would approach the company, so it can be a learning experience at a higher-level, and hopefully be something that is disseminated to all of their staff.  I would keep my name out of it, and if the teacher seemed sincere, I would not name him specifically either.  I would want this to be a positive outcome event, not a negative one.  If it becomes negative (if someone is penalized, loses their job, etc) the moment of positive influence is lost - and negative stereotypes will be further enforced.

 If you dont normally have this issue with other 1080 videos, then this is a limitation in how the video was encoded.  What you want to do is reencode it, allowing for PAR (anamorphic picture sizing). 




 Do you know if you are referring to *Chicago style* or *Sicilian style*?  That might help narrow it down.  I'm not certain what you mean by *NY style* in terms of crust thickness.

  What were the cows like when you were young?

They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona

And the fields always had little fluffy cows

And they moved down, they were long and clear

And there were lots of stars at night

And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful

The most beautiful cows as a matter of fact

The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire

And the cows would catch the colors everywhere

That's neat, 'cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little

You don't see that... 




 I guess I should have been more specific in my question:  

Why not make/keep this a batch script?  If you have to edit a text file anyway; a batch script is a more visibly open/trustable solution to share.

In this case, I don't see an advantage to compiling this into an .exe, when this doesn't appear to be doing anything outside of the conventions of a batch script.

*No attack or offense intended.  I'm intrigued and genuinely curious.* 




 Why is this an .exe application?  The output is clearly of the built-in tree.exe command-line utility. 




 Thanks! 




 Please follow the rules when making requests.  Thanks!
