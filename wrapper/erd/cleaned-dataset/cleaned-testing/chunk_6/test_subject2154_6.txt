 Who invited 2014 CJ Wilson? 




 You can't be serious 




 Except against us. Give him a rest against us, you know, so you don't blow out his arm. Then I'm okay with this. 




 We didn't score..hard to blame Morin completely. Yes he let them wedge the game open a bit, but we didn't score. Richards loses even if he gets the last out there. 

This sub is ridiculous, no sense of perspective on here at all.  




 Yeah it seemed that way from what I saw of the situation. Same thing seemed like it happened to Adam Eaton too, more or less.

You guys are ekeing your way back to respectability though, hopefully in a couple of seasons you'll be back in contention. Goldy sure is fun to watch. 




 Thanks Latrell 




 CAN WE SCORE PRETTY PLEASE OUR OFFENSE IS GOOD I PROMISE 




 A lot of Angels fans thought he got thrown off by the Home Run Derby, but yeah he just wasn't that good at all after May. 

Yeah trading Upton was Towers having an axe to grind right? He just didn't like his lack of hustle/grit/whatever. And Trumbo is a vastly inferior player, yeah haha.

 




 I was of the opinion Trumbo was a drag on our offense because of it before we dealt him. Most of the homers he hit the year before were in April or May. He was flat-out bad after the All-Star break that year.

Yep, that's exactly what happened to us with him too. When he's hitting Trumbombs it's okay, but when those stop flowing he becomes a strikeout machine and huge drag on the offense. 




 Haha I was actually just making a joke from Infinite Jest, where Canada and the US keep arguing whether it's The Great Concavity or The Great Convexity.

But yeah, that too! 




 I guess I replied sloppily, my bad. I didn't mean we shouldn't be getting more than we have been (you're right, we're down), we just shouldn't be getting much more. This area isn't supposed to get much rain, and that's what I read you as saying. 

Weave's velocity has been on the way down for a few years now, but at the beginning of this year his fastball dropped all the way down to 83-84, and he's gotten thrashed a couple of times. He said himself he felt like he was throwing BP on the mound. That being said, he's a gamer if I've ever seen one, and I still have faith in him. He threw a complete game shutout against the Astros his last time out. It'll be interesting to see if he can produce for us. Even though he started Opening Day again for us this year, realistically, he's our #3 at best. 




 Convexing! 




 It's actually turning into a big deal that people don't understand this with the drought. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what southern California should be able to support population-wise, amongst most people. People don't understand the urgency of water conservation because there are no signs to them that we're running out. Water comes out of the faucet when they turn it on, and that's the only interaction 95% of people have with their water supply.

But anyway, yes, baseball is good and I like it. 




 Was counting it in Gold Glove defense, but yeah, the dude can unload the ball. 




 Yeah to be honest, I thought we got an unbelievably good deal. His career OBP was under .300 when we dealt him. Even though he was a fan favorite, I was psyched when news of that deal came through. It's worked out well too, Skaggs was good last year before TJ, and Santiago has an ERA under 2.50 right now. 




 Glad this is noticed. Kole is a really good player. Gold Glove caliber defense, plus 15-20 HR pop and a .300 average in the leadoff spot. He's the sparkplug for the team too 




 Wow that's bad. Good old Trumbo.

How do you guys feel about that trade? 




 No we shouldn't. Mediterranean climate essentially means coastal desert. 




 It's okay, I was cussing at the out-of-town scoreboard when I saw you guys take the lead. 




 This is a pretty steep discount since he wants to stay in LA; annual value is roughly what he'd get on the market, but he'd have gotten at least another year. 




 He gave us a pretty substantial discount because he wanted to stay in Socal. He was looking for 4 years/~$37 million, and likely would've gotten it, given what elite closers are going for nowadays. Awesome news for us. 




 X-rays came back negative actually 




 Yeah the time calls were getting later and later. In the 10th it was justified cuz of all the looking down at second, but in the 11th it was just silly a couple times.  




 I was at the game and I didn't think he had any chance of scoring when I saw the ball off the bat. Wasn't even close at the plate, Featherston scored easy.  




 Yeah, I'm skeptical of extrapolating a pace this early in the year, but he's definitely running well. 




 Yeah the steals declining is almost exclusively due to Pujols hating it when people in front of him go. I'd say we'll see at least 30 from him this year. 




 What are you using to say his speed is declining? I watch him play all the time, and he's super super fast.

He runs a lot less ever since he moved to the 2 hole in the lineup, because Pujols really doesn't like it when people on base in front of him are trying to steal. But Pujols has gotten over it a bit, and he's opening up the running game a little bit more. 




 He has 7 stolen bases so far this year. 




 You guys are currently dead last in the majors in BABIP (and here I was feeling bad for us at 28th). You'll rebound. 




 Ouch. I saw something about how you guys were really lucky in 1 run games last year, so paying the piper I guess :/

Still, it has sucked to have Zobrist out I'm sure. And Doolittle being on the DL can't have helped your bullpen. 




 This will change, it has to change..right? 




 I mean, they've definitely done it before, so who am I to question it?

But still, I didn't think they were gonna be very good, and so far they're not. Plenty of time to turn it around though. They have had some poor injury luck. 




 Am I the only one that didn't feel like they were actually gonna be that good? 




 I hope so too! I really like Efren. 




 Gotta be the Astros right? 




 Efren has to stay in the minors for at least 10 days since he got optioned back, so they called up Krauss instead. 




 Moreso than anything else, it's the TV thing. You guys don't bring new markets, so you don't bring new money, and therefore have nothing that the conference really wants. 




 It makes me happy. 




 Sucks for us, awesome for the bullpen. Get fresh, cuz it'll be 3 weeks between off days. 




 Colon being the best in the "teehee, fat guy pitching" sense. Both of them were really good for us. 




 I forgot about the best one. Totally forgot he was on the team that far back. 




 WAIT THIS IS THE SAME KEVIN GREGG

HOW

I JUST ASSUMED. "GREGG'S NOT THAT UNCOMMON OF A LAST NAME" 




 The Rockies don't need an ace, they need a whole rotation. And if you're trading any of the cornerstones (Arenado, CarGo, Tulo), you better be getting established major league talent AND prospects. 

But I'm sure the fact that the Phillies are rebuilding and just so happen to have an ace on the trading block has nothing to do with your willingness to trade the Rockies' star players for an ace. 




 I'm excited to have you guys in town this week. Never seen Tulo, CarGo, or Arenado play in person, and I'm stoked.

(pls don't beat us though) 




 This is awesome.

Might be cool to try and work in the culture around the game, like all the ballpark food (good way to teach some of those words too), and clips of people celebrating, that kind of thing. 




 **A River Runs Through It, by Norman Maclean** 




 I can understand that perspective. I usually recommend Thousand Autumns as a starting point for Mitchell because it's a more traditional narrative structure, but still has really good examples of a lot of Mitchell's hallmarks (like you were saying). 

Thousand Autumns does have an unusual rhythm to its pacing though, so I can see how you'd feel that way. 




 Does anyone have any context? 




 I picked up *Disgrace* by J.M. Coetzee at a thrift store with no expectations, and it really delivered. A haunting look at a man growing old and realizing he never really figured much of anything out. Devestating, and incredible. Read it in a couple of days.

*A Prayer For Owen Meany* also got me. The novel inhabits such a weird but wonderful (in a weird way of course) world. 




 There's not much fiction, but there's a ton of great outdoor nonfiction writing. John Muir, Edward Abbey, Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall, Sigurd Olson, Henry David Thoreau, Eric Shipton..try a few, see what you like.

 




 Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Larry McMurtry are all very known Western writers. 




 Oh yeah basketball has very little to do with it in most cases, and a limited role at best. As has been proven by every single conference realignment move. 




 Grantland is an ESPN property, so Simmons will be leaving there too. 




 We've been really glad to have him, dude's been incredible. Walk-off double two nights ago too 




 Seconded. I think Thousand Autumns is a really good Mitchell book to start with. 




 I mean to be fair, if La Tech couldn't get one in any of the last 3 years, and you guys couldn't get one last year...safe to say an at-large isn't gonna happen. 




 The Angels being only 3 games under .500 is actually kind of miraculous and deeply troubling at the same time. 

The perceived weakness of the team, starting pitching, has actually been pretty good outside of Weaver, who's "throwing BP out there", as he put it himself.

But the bullpen, one of the strongest in the league last year, has given away 4 or 5 games at least, already. Largely because we have Huston Street in the 9th, Joe Smith in the 8th, and who the hell knows before them. Smith had some bad BABIP luck that caused him to cough up a couple games, and now Street's arm is about to fall off from being literally the only reliable guy so far this year, and it's showing (2 blown saves in a row, including 3 runs in the 9th last night to fumble away a 2-0 lead and the win).

But the most troublesome thing to me is the way the offense has looked. Outside of Trout and Johnny Giavotella (who has been amazing, and is making a lot of Angels fans really glad we traded Howie, which is something I never would've thought possible), the offense is sputtering mightily. Calhoun has gotten it going as of late, and I think he'll stay there. Pujols has had bad BABIP luck, so hopefully that changes. But this is the main reason we're losing games. We had the league leading offense last year. In the past week, we're scoring less than 2 and a half runs per game, and that seems right about our season average. It's a small wonder that we've been losing games with our bullpen. That's what happens when you give a razor-thin margin of error.



TL;DR Angels have sputtered in a big way, but surprisingly because of the offense, not the pitching 




 Big outfield, both aren't very good defenders anyway, and Myers is being forced to play CF even though he's a corner outfielder because Kemp and Upton already take the corners. 




 That's not in their defense haha. The Angels were dickheads for the way we acted, and the Yankees are too 




 Guys, this is supposed to be funny. Just laugh 




 I saw a few people with us in third, but no one had us lower than that. 




 Street's been pretty good for us :D 




 Jackson's not seeing the majors any time soon. Organizational depth. Still, nice to get something, anything, back for a guy we cut. 




 It's ridiculously well established that the best teams don't always win in the playoffs. 




 I mean, given the sheer amount of talent you've been able to call up in the past few years, it's about damn time the cupboard is bare. 




 Yeah I know I was mostly just being sad hahah. Dude's been awful. Although he's starting to hit the ball harder. 




 That makes me really happy to hear. It's seemed like he's doing well from afar, glad to hear it's indeed the case!
 




 Certainly not this year... 




 We don't hold the schools to the standard of full 4 year scholarships. Players lose their scholarships, and it's not even rare. 




 It wasn't meant to be a bulletproof comparison, just an illustration of the fact that sometimes 1 hit is a big deal.

Hamilton wasn't good in the series, almost entirely because he was playing through injury. That homer was incredibly clutch, and should have won the series for them, and is even more impressive given the injury he was playing through. Both of those things can be true at the same time. 




 He had a sports hernia..

In related news, Kirk Gibson was pretty worthless outside of his home run in 1988. 




 Yep, exactly. There's also the Mudiay approach, he played in China this year (although a lot of people think it's probably because he wouldn't have been eligible at SMU). 




 I could actually see the NYY fan turnout going down a bit without Jeter there to vote into the starting lineup yet again. It'll be interesting to see if that has an effect.

But on the real, ARod. That would be amazing. 




 He can go to the NBA one year after graduating high school. Everything that has come out indicates he will graduate in June, so he will be eligible to enter the NBA Draft next year.

This point has been a particularly obstinate piece of misinformation. 




 Well, there's always *Fight Club*. 




 Yeah it's really not close, the 2011 team was on one to make it to the title game. 




 They were a 3 actually. 




 Wow, thanks for all the legwork! I want to say someone had a Gordon triple timed between 10.5 and 11, which would tilt the math towards a bang-bang play, but holding him was definitely the right call given how it went down. Just a fun thought experiment. 




 Pete Kozma and Daniel Descalso look identical when wearing hats 




 Wish I remembered where I'd seen it so I could link you, but I saw Gordon's fastest time to 3rd last year compared to the time at which Crawford got the relay throw, and it seemed to show that Crawford would've had a good chance to get him, but that Gordon would've had a chance to be safe as well.
 




 THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S HARD OUT HERE SOMETIMES 




 My impression of that play was that he was charging it hard to make it look like he could get to it, when in reality he was never gonna get it and was only charging it to feint Canha into not scoring. Which worked. 




 Ian Kinsler. He's just always come off like a colossal douche to me; glad he's out of the division now. 




 If he would've been sprinting out of the box, the times suggest it would've been a play at the plate.

Given that he was not sprinting out of the box because he expected it to be a single, the consensus is that he was out by 40 feet if he turns. 




 WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT. I WAS BEING NICE. 




 IT'S OKAY BRO, JUST GET JOSH TO A PLACE OF PERSONAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY AGAIN SO HE CAN RECLAIM HIS LIFE AND WE CAN ALL WATCH. BASEBALL IS BETTER WITH A HAPPY, HEALTHY, EFFECTIVE JOSH HAMILTON.

EXCEPT AGAINST US, PLEASE DON'T DO IT AGAINST US. AS A FAVOR FOR EATING THE CONTRACT. 




 Not in the past 2 weeks. 




 I almost feel like you should have to commit to your appeal if you make it now. Like if you file it, you have to take it all the way through. Just to keep people from doing this. 




 THANK YOU BASED TROUT 




 *The Financial Lives of Poets* by Jess Walter. Dude is just a really funny writer in general, but this one especially made me laugh. 




 Really? I'd always heard the opposite, but I guess none of those were sourced. 




 That was a great inning defensively for Featherston.
