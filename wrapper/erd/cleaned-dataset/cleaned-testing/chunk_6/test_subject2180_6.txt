 Two of the victims who are still being forced to live around the predator and the predators supporters it's the same as trying to talk to a abused child while the abuser stands over his shoulder giving the kid death stares. Theirs no way you can get an actual idea of what is going on in that environment.  




 Are their any studies on this? showing trans suicide rates in more progressive regions versus more hostile? that would be a good study.   




 Been agreeing with your post in glad to see their are advocates like you for transpeople. But i was reading through one of your links about trans people throughout history, i'm a history major myself http://www.bilerico.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php and allot of this seems to be speculation heavily based on the instances of crossdressing or genderless deities.

Much like how some people use the presence of societies worshiping female warrior deities as an example that their have been female warriors when deities themselves are more of a ideal in not actually a factual basis, other examples like in south america of women dressing as men also does not reinforce this idea. In albania it's common for women to dress up as men if they're no men remaining in order to lead or protect their families, while i'm not outright disagreeing but allot of the cited cases don't to be transgender but more akin to a mulan if you will. Not people who actually identify as the other gender.  




 Very informative thank you.  




 Not a hater of trans people please don't dm me. But question is it true john hopkins officially stopped performing reassignment surgery and declared this a mental illness? 









 Not disagreeing but you'r comfortable others may not be. I think this really will always come down to how people feel on a case by case basis.  




 I don't get this, one minute we're supposed to get over human body issues and next we should all have non gendered separate stalls for privacy? are we becoming more progressive or conservative? 




 Their perspective if heavily influenced by their family is not theirs but a orchestrated ploy by the family for pure PR. 




 Bitchball more like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07mBfR8erMY 




 You're the people who are shitting on america just for being america. That's the definition of nationalism, you think your country is better then america, you're better then us because you consider us ignorant. That's the height of bullshit nationalism, i could easily go off on the shithole you more then likely live in but i don't, that's why i like my country, call us conceited but we could careless about 99% of other countries. We do not spend half of our free time bitching about some country we have never been to, will probably never visit and does not effect us in any way. Only you come on reddit, american site, using google a american search engine, with a fucking laptop, cellphone or computer probably from america to bitch and moan about the very country providing you with the tool's to call them ignorant. Do you see the level of irony in that?

All of the comments i have seen have been nothing more then a circle jerk of f america because that's popular. Jesus get over yourselves, if we compete then we compete. Have fun flopping on your grass, i did not say we could be the best i said we could compete. Only thing worse then a boastful fool is a dismissive fool like yourself.

Your issue is you think you're the end all of soccer, where you from? i bet your country is not even that great, but you condescendingly act like your the master of it, do you even play? jesus i can admit i'm inexperienced but at-least i state this, you act like your opinion is any more factual then mine, jesus it's like that movie on the Jamaican bob sled team, you know little about how our country develops our athlete so stop talking like you do. We don't know what would occur until it bloody happens, all i know is that in general we dominate the world Olympics in various competitions. Our population is the WORLD! we have immigrants from Ecuador, Brazil,Spain England etc, you really think we could not be a competitive soccer team? you act like your clubs don't recruit internationally  and are made up of players from across the globe. You act like a us team could not do the same just shut it. 

If you think that theirs some magical knowledge that is ingrained into your blood stream at having a good soccer team or you need some great culture to kick a ball around then just stop it. Your the same as the idiots who say we would be the best at soccer from the get go.  




 Pretty fly for a white guy.  




 Tell that to the sikhs.  




 True but it goes into the american thing. Americans are not white, we're americans. Majority does does not wipe out the fact they're Tuareg and other darker skinned algerians.   




 http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/algerian-traditional-dress/ It's alright while most algerians are pretty light Tuareg also come from algeria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people
Just call me him a Tuareg 




 You mean cricket? is that the thing with the bat or is... oh wait you mean the biggest sport where it's not really sport but where you pretend to be injured for 10 minutes. I think that's called acting where we come from, one opponent that happened to at one point or another controlled or influenced one third of the world.  




 No were not claiming anything. We simply stated we could compete if soccer was more popular in america, just like we could compete if cricket became more popular in america. This is not a claim but a well established facts, america does amazing in the Olympics. On a international scale we repeatedly shown we're definitely top ten in most sports.

I could give a fuck all about your football, but stop acting like you idiots have a set recipe for making great football players. England invented the sport in they suck at it, yet i here people making the same bullshit excuses about how america is only good at sports we invent. I have no idea who does guys are, so i have nothing to compare them too. It's not about having 6ft tall beast though, you are stereotyping because you have a onesided view of american athleticism, we have 300+ people we're not all Michael jordans, have you seen american quarter backs? look at brett favre? you call him a example of athleticism, a QB does not have to be a adonis of athleticism to be good or even great at the game some of the best one's were couch potato's. we can find 5ft7 guys just like we found the women for soccer.

But to do that we need coaching staff, we need people to actually care about the sport. Jesus this is why america does not care about world opinion, you assume we're ignorant and not conscientious then are shocked when you're proven wrong. You guys are the most elitist jackasses i have ever seen, all we're stating is that we could compete, just like we always do and we could be good. Because guess what, that's what being an american is, even if we suck we don't give in, we keep practicing and trying harder. We don't believe in defeatism or relegating ourselves to being underdogs. Maybe you guys should stop being assholes in maybe try learning this thing called sportsmanship? oh wait no you guys are just a bunch of ultra nationalist who use football to talk shit about other countries while decrying america as a hive of uberpatriots fuck off.  




 "And the reason it never became popular is because you kind of suck at football. It's really a catch-22 moment for you guys.
You're not good at football because it's not popular, and it's not popular because you're not good at it."


You contradict yourself saying Americans don't suck at football because we don't care but because we just suck in general. Then use this to say you don't care about women soccer that's why the us won. It's contradictory bullshit. Your an idiot. We could give a shit about soccer, we care even less for women soccer yet we still won it. Nobody cares about half the sports america competes in during the Olympics yet we still get gold, get over yourself. Sucking at a sport does not mean you don't care about it, plus we don't suck at soccer our men team is actually pretty decent from what i hear.
 

The american's who went to the moon, winning the space race, developed most of the technology you're using right now to say we're shit at most things and the people who dominate the epitome of athleticism every 4 years when the world collectively comes together to get stomped by the us Olympic team. Yeah buddy keep on, you're just a delusional hater. God i really do hope soccer becomes more popular in america just so we can stomp you idiots in it. 

 




 In how well do they do in the Olympics? at the end of the day we have a set record for performing good in international event. Jesus we just won the female world cup, obviously Americans can compete on any level.  




 TIL to be good at soccer you must be born in Uruguay, have soccer in your blood, you must be born from your mother being impregnated by a soccer coach and you must eat a thousand blades of grass from the purest soccer turf. Only then my apprentice shall you master the ability of flopping. 




 In my experience their seems to be a bunch of people made about the women world cup still hating on americans for saying we might actually be able to compete if we cared to play.  




 Unique skill set, i'm pretty sure we can flop with the best of them.  320 million people who do not even know soccer is actually called football versus 3.5 million who's only chance of ever having a better life is through football..... yeah makes sense.  




 God this is why we don't like you soccer nations. Ingrained into your culture? jesus stop being full of yourselves. The fact England sucks shows how bullshit this argument about culture is.  




 Hakkzpets um we just won the women's world cup. Are you guys retarded or what. It's not popular because we don't care about soccer, we named it soccer for a reason. Now stfu in wait for the next olympics so we can dominate you little third world nations again.  




 How is it asinine, people are posting we only do good in sports that are popular here but no shit, that's how it works. Would spain,brazil or any of those countries be good in soccer if they were not extremely focused on them and very popular. America dominates in the Olympics, if we focused on soccer we would more then likely at-least be competitive to a certain extent. You in user https://www.reddit.com/user/CptMurphy think we're talking about oh we throw in a few running backs on the field and some point guards in bam we can win the world cup, no we're saying that if we focused our athletic resources and got kids into soccer at a early age like the rest of the world does, we could be on the same level as the rest of the world.

Remember america is a sleeping giant, don't wake us up.  




 Tell that to japan about baseball or china about soccer.  




 China loves basketball, japan loves baseball along with most Caribbean countries.  




 True. But we also dominate the olympics. Oh in we just won world cup thingy or w.e the world calls not football.  




 Bro i'm a zionist shill not. I don't use alternate accounts. If i did i might have more karma lolz. What am i praising kurds for? you're assyrian i'm guessing? i'm sorry if you feel like the kurds are pressing for control of territory your people want but i still support them. Compared to other parts of the region they're the best chance for stability. 

If basra was safe then why did they change the gulf cup because of security concerns? listen i'm not against you i just support kurds. I don't dislike assyrians and i support all secular people, i dislike the iranian government yet i like their people because i know they're moderates. I've talked to a number of southern iraqi's on fb in i understand that they're atleast moderate enough to talk openly with jews/pro israeli's in even support israel, so that has drastically changed my view on shia. I don't particularly care for sunni's but the kurds are sunni in i respect them.

In yes i know about the embassy bombing, i know the kurds history, there are various groups who even kidnapped some foreign nationals back in the 90's but what's your point. I'm not stating that the kurds are perfect, israel has done questionable military strikes in the past but i still support them. The kurds are atleast in 5 different conflicts right now from isis, to syria, to the FSA/various rebel groups, turkey possibly and next it may be iran for all i know.  




 /r/shitredditsays basically they link reddit comments and have a circle jerk talking crap or making witty statements about the user in his comments or his "complex" or compensating or w.e basically like brigading without actually brigading. But who knows they probably pm the user too. I don't know how they do not get banned. 




 Aww now i see. You're mad because the kurds are building a state on your territory.  




 Indeed. Did not know this?

It has been said that the history of almost all of the Jewish holidays can be summed up succinctly: "They wanted to kill us; we won. Let's eat." Why has anti-Semitism been so pervasive in so many countries, in so many time periods and for so many reasons? (One begins to wonder. Perhaps there is something wrong with the Jews and Judaism? After all, there is an old Yiddish saying -- "If one person calls you a donkey, ignore him; if two people call you a donkey, buy a saddle.")

Between the years 250 CE and 1948 CE - a period of 1,700 years - Jews have experienced more than eighty expulsions from various countries in Europe - an average of nearly one expulsion every twenty-one years. Jews were expelled from England, France, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, Spain, Portugal, Bohemia, Moravia and seventy-one other countries.

Historians have classified six explanations as to why people hate the Jews:

Economic -- "We hate Jews because they possess too much wealth and power."
Chosen People -- "We hate Jews because they arrogantly claim that they are the chosen people."
Scapegoat -- "Jews are a convenient group to single out and blame for our troubles."
Deicide -- "We hate Jews because they killed Jesus."
Outsiders, -- "We hate Jews because they are different than us." (The dislike of the unlike.)
Racial Theory -- "We hate Jews because they are an inferior race."

As we examine the explanations, we must ask -- Are they the causes for anti-Semitism or excuses for Anti-Semitism? The difference? If one takes away the cause, then anti-Semitism should no longer exist. If one can show a contradiction to the explanation, it demonstrates that the "cause" is not a reason, it is just an excuse. Let's look at some contradictions:

Economic -- The Jews of 17th- 20th century Poland and Russia were dirt poor, had no influence and yet they were hated.
 
Chosen People -- a) In the late 19th century, the Jews of Germany denied "Choseness." And then they worked on assimilation. Yet, the holocaust started there. b) Christians and Moslems profess to being the "Chosen people," yet, the world and the anti-Semites tolerate them. 
 
Scapegoat -- Any group must already be hated to be an effective scapegoat. The Scapegoat Theory does not then cause anti-Semitism. Rather, anti-Semitism is what makes the Jews a convenient scapegoat target. Hitler's ranting and ravings would not be taken seriously if he said, "It's the bicycle riders and the midgets who are destroying our society." 
 
Deicide -- a) the Christian Bible says the Romans killed Jesus, though Jews are mentioned as accomplices (claims that Jews killed Jesus came several hundred years later). How come the accomplices are persecuted and there isn't an anti-Roman movement through history? b) Jesus himself said, "Forgive them [i.e., the Jews], for they know not what they do." The Second Vatican Council in 1963 officially exonerated the Jews as the killers of Jesus. Neither statement of Christian belief lessened anti-Semitism.
 
Outsiders -- With the Enlightenment in the late 18th century, many Jews rushed to assimilate. Anti-Semitism should have stopped. Instead, for example, with the Nazis came the cry, in essence: "We hate you, not because you're different, but because you're trying to become like us! We cannot allow you to infect the Aryan race with your inferior genes."
 
Racial Theory -- The overriding problem with this theory is that it is self-contradictory: Jews are not a race. Anyone can become a Jew - and members of every race, creed and color in the world have done so at one time or another.(correction jews are a ethno-religious group)

Every other hated group is hated for a relatively defined reason. We Jews, however, are hated in paradoxes: Jews are hated for being a lazy and inferior race - but also for dominating the economy and taking over the world. We are hated for stubbornly maintaining our separateness - and, when we do assimilate - for posing a threat to racial purity through intermarriages. We are seen as pacifists and as warmongers; as capitalist exploiters and as revolutionary communists; possessed of a Chosen-People mentality, as well as of an inferiority complex. It seems that we just can't win. 


 Of all the extreme fanaticism which plays havoc in mans nature, there is not one as irrational as anti-Semitism.  If the Jews are rich [these fanatics] are victims of theft. If they are poor, they are victims of ridicule. If they take sides in a war, it is because they wish to take advantage from the spilling of non-Jewish blood. If they espouse peace, it is because they are scared by their natures or traitors. If the Jew dwells in a foreign land he is persecuted and expelled. If he wishes to return to his own land, he is prevented from doing so.

- Lloyd George stated in 1923

   "The uniqueness of anti-Semitism lies in the fact that no other people in the world have ever been charged simultaneously with alienation from society and with cosmopolitanism, with being capitalistic exploiters and also revolutionary communist advocators. The Jews were accused of having an imperious mentality, at the same time they're a people of the book. They're accused of being militant aggressors, at the same time as being cowardly pacifists. With being a Chosen people, and also having an inferior human nature. With both arrogance and timidity. With both extreme individualism and community adherence. With being guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus and at the same time held to account for the invention of christianity."

- A speech about the irrationality of anti-Semitism 
by professor Michael Curtis, of Rutgers University, 1987
 




 Oh look neo-nazi's complaining about a positive story on jews. LOL 




 I already explained this. Muslims did not save him in ww2, it was Christians, now he feels a personal obligation to help those who helped him. Christians are a extreme minority in the region directly being persecuted, they're in the same position he was in back in the 1940's.

While i'm sure if he see's a fleeing muslim family he would not be like, you guys are not christians get out, he is focusing his efforts on christians because that's where he can do the most good and save the most people while also satisfying the debt he feels to those Christians who saved his life. But once again, people like you are not doing shit, just complaining, unless you want to fight isis be quiet.  




 I'm pretty sure the kindertransports had allot to do with their religious values not in spite of them. Christians are odd like that, one minute they're doing pogroms the next they're supporting jewish statehoods. You do realize Christianity is a offshoot of Judaism correct? once again millions of muslims, only thousands of christians. He's trying to help the most persecuted people who's very life is in danger. 




 Yes i'm well aware, it was also non existent until very recently for their to be any kind of terrorist attack in Iraqi Kurdistan and it's extremely peaceful compared to well any other part of iraq. In yeah but i agree, their maybe some islamist factions but of course there are, kurds are in the middle-east, it would be surprising if this was not the case  but atleast the kurds stick up to their radicals and implement moderation and secularism which is more then then allot of other countries do.  




 Pm me. How did it ruin the message of the film?
