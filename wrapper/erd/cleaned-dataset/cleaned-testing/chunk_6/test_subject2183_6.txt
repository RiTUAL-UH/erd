 I'm not implying that freedom and peace actually work together but many people seek both. 




 STICKY 




 Breathing in the warm summer air from my hometown flooding memories of a blissful perfect childhood summer playing with friends, It feels beyond perfect as if heaven. So much happiness. Life was so good.

Whenever I get those memories I get knocked out of my daily routine, they are amazing.

 We had a substitute teacher that looked like elvis and sounded like elvis in art class, the first thing he said was.

"Good morning my name is Mr Balls"

The whole class laughed for 15 minutes non stop while he was standing looking all indifferent, me and a friend kept on laughing and we couldn't breathe.

Next art lesson he was balls gone. Turns out he got fired because someone broke a table in his class.

I said to my mates, "He got sacked"

I was like 14 when I made that pun 




 Wow that's just slightly less rare than winning the lottery. 




 Exactly what I was working on,

Single-tasking is very valuable
Multi-tasking is an addiction that undermines one's life

 Try and train your brain to think of ways to find real women every time you get horny, this will make it a habit. I know how badly one can want sex but limit the time that you are idle and make sure you are focusing on your life.

 Yeah I know; I mentioned earlier that there is indeed nonsense 




 Coincidence I was watching that right now; I don't really understand the significance of the present moment the way sam describes it, why is it that important?

 I hear this all the time but the people who say it don't elaborate; can you? 




 I don't have a passion for anything I lost interest in most things about the age of 10 (idk what happened to me maybe some event or one of my childhood operations something gone wrong) after losing it at 10; my time became occupied with philosophy and just wasting time mindlessly or on intellectual things like science and math. I know people who have a passion but it seems pointless, one friend is in love with cars but he wastes all of his money and screws himself over, he says that he loves it and enjoys it but it seems like an illusion and completely unjustified another friend is the exact same but with computers

btw how do you think I lost my passion for life and certain fields like math and technology? 




 Wow; there are many myths there about cutting back on food. Check out  the two links i just posted. 




 Intermittent fasting; every second day to 5:2; Water; am trying to reduce blood glucose, IGF-1 and improve other things I am 18 and a male.

 Is that height good? How does it compare with your parents and family? 




 God damn this thread is making me have some sort of vertigo, feel sick.
For me: death, non-existence, the size of the universe, the age of the universe 




 Try and frame it this way, "Think of it as if you are not seeing France right now, you don't see the black version of France, you don't see France at all" 














 I exercise; I also lift. You've got it the other way around. I look thin but I suspect my body fat % is higher than what it could be. 




 Yeah I was thinking that; why do I still have a lot of body fat? especially over my abdominals

[This might better express my means](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvdbtt_eat-fast-live-longer-hd_shortfilms)

I have high IGF-1, Blood glucose, cholesterol and pretty sure body fat is over 15% 




 I'm very healthy; don't smoke; I am intelligent. 




 Will fasting and low calories interfere with my height and growth? I heard that nutrition plays a big role in one's height 














 yeah. hmm idk what to do man 




 Spontaneous generation (not really) or geese are common carriers for fish eggs. they spend a lot of time walking around in the shallows looking for something to eat, picking up eggs on their feet and underbelly. when they fly to the new pond and splash down, the water often dislodges the eggs and drops them off in their new home 




 What is your method of meditation and how do you reach these 1000x pleasurable states? 




 I theorised that the world was black and white back then. 




 I've seen doctors, psychologists, tried meditation, tried focusing on one goal. 




   I once knew someone who developed very similar dis-associative symptoms and his case became quite severe after awhile

Can you elaborate on that? 




 improved focus, less anxiety, some sort of awakening, new perspective on life, less stress and anger, enlightenment, less multi tasking, more control over attention, more efficient thinking 









 Strangely I developed another symptom today, I was looking at my left bicep since my right is normally stronger. I thought to myself, "Is that my left or my right?" seriously I am starting to think it's neurological. "Why does the left side of my body feel like the right side?" I was worried especially for the fact that this resembles a stroke. 




 Some say naploeon and other say saneca 




 If I gave you my paypal email reddit, would you give me money to pursue my dreams? 




 It was happening before paleo, I think it developed after stressful family situations and exams 




 LOL quick tell us the secrets before they find out I'm a traitor 




  I'd say it's a natural reaction to obsess over it until it does.


exactly, I think we are getting somewhere with this
 




 No medication, what makes it sound like depersonalization? I see no correlation. 

Better examples:


Looking at the time 4:30pm, it's like my brain won't recognise that it's 4:30pm and I have to say to myself 4:30, FOOUURR THIRRTYY, hmm four thirty, that's late, , I HAVE TO DO THINGS (OCD feeling when I affirm that statement to myself) I never used to be like this. One very common example, is when negotiating a price, $35, thirtty five, is that a lot of money? is that worth it (more OCD feelings to repeat it until I get what $35 is in terms of it's value. 









 Possibly, i'l test around, I have been paleo for a month strict 



















 haha, i have a rule of thumb, ask the question, why should I do that? rather than; why not?

What good evidence is there for me to eat grains?
viola 




 Its better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing, than a long life spent in a miserable way.

I might pick the dream; I just don't want to be a hippy with a wasted life haha. On a serious note; Indeed the dream. 




 Working with ambiguity and a mix is fine.

 My concern is the moment that I have to take the leap, the moment I have to be decisive about making the project a full time commitment.

Money isn't a concern; knowledge is good; time is a factor.

agreed, tsk tsk 




 I hope this doesn't get lost in the comments.

God damn this traumatised my childhood. Even one time I had psychosis after a fever in a village. I was having a dream where I was in a place similar to the pit in the dark knight rises. There was a briefcase being opened with millions of dollars. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During this I was experiencing the worst feeling in my life it was truly like hell. I then felt like I was a tiny particle in that massive pit, destined to be there for eternity, unseen, unheard, nobody to save me or find me. (I'm an atheist now but my early christian upbringing might be related to the dream)

___________________________________________________________________________________________
 I went into automatic mode where my mind controlled my actions, I walked downstairs and started screaming, "I'm a stick! I'm a stick" I started banging my body against the wall and I managed to snap out of it. Most uncanny event that had ever occurred to me. Few years later I developed depersonalization and severe anxiety, still haven't got rid of it. 




 I sometimes think when two people are having a meaningful conversation, the conversation coming from the two parties is about a different topic, they both are convinced that they are talking about something but they both are applying a reality from their life experience, and words fill the gaps of missing meaning.
