 Nice!  It goes to show that I should read an article instead of just skimming through it.  Thanks for letting me know! 




 While I agree with the sentiment, I just can't see this actually passing.  SW is (unfortunately) a HUGE money maker for southern California so I don't see the reps from that area allowing it to pass. 




 Hi Skrillex!

I wanted to thank you for introducing me to the dubstep genre.

Do you agree with those that say dubstep is a dying (if not already dead) genre?

I believe there are still some phenomenal dubstep producers creating amazing music, but it seems as though many people believe that the popularity of the genre will never again be close to what it was in 2011/2012. 




 I have what was described to me as a corn sensitivity, but is essentially an intolerance (intestinal cramping, IBS, other digestive discomforts).  I've been dealing with it for about 6 or 7 years now, and you definitely learn to pay attention to the ingredients in food.  The cool thing is that recently there has been a bump in cane (or beet) sugar popularity, at least in my region of the U.S.  You have to avoid things that you used to consume regularly, but, at least for me, there were great, albeit more expensive, alternatives available.  If anything, I feel more freed to try new things and diversify my diet than I do limited by not having (many) corn-derived products.

Good luck to you on your new edible adventure! 




 Don't herta yourself coming up with one. 




 I have a 2 foot tall brachiosaurus statue in my yard!  He's not as interesting as this guy, unfortunately.  We sometimes put a little mask on him for Halloween, but that's about it in terms of dressing up. 




 If you're looking for rap over a dubstep beat, one of my favorites is [Like This (feat. Virus Syndicate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xishhKPQ9Nw feature=kp) by SKisM.  Flux Pavilion was who really got me hooked onto dubstep - [I Can't Stop is one of his most well known songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9rewnLFYw) but he also does a song called [Do or Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNqRuyFSXk) with rap from Childish Gambino.  I also recommend [Dodge   Fuski](https://soundcloud.com/dodgeandfuski).  I love [Zomboy](https://soundcloud.com/zomboy) as well.  If you're interested in a more melodic/chill kind of sound, Seven Lions also makes great melodic dubstep.  His remix of [Running to the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZREifFcEs) is one of my most favorite songs right now.

A majority of the dubstep artists I listen to are signed on to either on [Never Say Die Records](http://www.wewillneversaydie.com/mixes/) or [Disciple Recordings](http://www.disciplerecs.com/mixes/), both of which release free mixes made by their artists periodically.  I'd say my favorites at NSD are SKisM, Zomboy, and Eptic.  Disciple Recs is younger, so I only really know Dodge   Fuski (who used to be with NSD), but I'm really liking what Pegboard Nerds and Astronaut are putting out.  You should also check out the artists over at [OWSLA](http://owsla.com/artists/), which is where Skrillex and Seven Lions are
signed.  Kill Paris, Kill the Noise, and Porter Robinson are also great from OWSLA.

As far as trap goes, I don't listen to much, but I do like things by Brillz, LOUDPVCK, RL Grime, Buku, and Baauer.

Sorry this turned into a wall of text, but hopefully this will help you find something you like!
 














 I'm currently going through the grad school application process which involves emailing a huge number of professors about their labs and I'd say my response rate is about 50 percent.  It seems like a majority of the professors that I have interacted with in this process and also during my undergrad are more than happy to help students, especially ones that show an interest in what they work on! 




 If you strike out here, I'd suggest looking up research papers on a particular marine mammal-related topic you're interested in and emailing the authors.  It's likely many of them will be too busy and will decline or may miss your email altogether, but I'm sure you'd find someone willing to talk about his or her research!
