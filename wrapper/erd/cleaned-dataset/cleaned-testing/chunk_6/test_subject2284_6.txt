 a lot of that stuff can be explained by Velkas involvement, because returning to the asylum is beneficial to the undead (and allows you to get to the painted world, an area with heavy velka associations, it's reasonable to assume she had some impetus in this stuff.

1) The stray demon has the Titanite slab, and its beneficial to the CU to fight him, therefore, the floor was either broken by a third party trying to help you (velka, possibly gwyndolin) or was broken during the same time dilation that all of Lordran is experiencing (enemies are different in the asylum too, you could have escaped thousands of years ago)

2)Peculiar doll is likely supplied by Velka, seeing as the painted world is the best grinding area in the game, and gives you lots of god killing items, and also has a strong Velka association.

3) Anastacia is the only Firekeeper who still has a body, although why she doesn't dissapear like everyone else is unknown, perhaps it's something to do with the way of white?

4)Rats have a high drop rate because they've been eating humans

5) This is a genuine oversight, much like ciaran using the dark/gold tracers after giving them to you

6) Snuggly can again be explained by the velka association, you put some garbage item down, and the giant crow replaces it with actually useful stuff.

You're confusing **ambiguities** with 'making sense' 




 So you've never played dwarf fortress? 




 WOW Kim is 29? Never realized, she looks so youthful! 




 Hey, with a new planescape game out soon and all the divinity stuff, why don't you give planescape:torment a try? 




 Sarkeesian's ever gaining snowball of popularity continues. To be honest, I'm slightly worried that it'll make all criticism of Sarkeesian be branded 'pro-gamergate' which would kind of suck, as I'm honestly not much of a fan of the 'Tropes vs Women' series. 




 He was on the podcast *before* TB started burning bridges by saying things like 'Sarkeesian's death threats have nothing in them, otherwise she'd be dead'. All of Tb's interactions with Jim have been one sided on  his part, and *I personally* doubt Jim will want to associate himself with I guy who he's pretty opposed to without TB making some sort of sweeping retraction of his GG support. 




 TB's also been burning a *lot* of bridges lately, particularly with his post saying that white privilege doesn't exist, which seems to have soured his relationship with Jim sterling.  




 Someone attempted to do it again with MGSV recently too, they set up a crappy youtube account with weird, surrealist with obscure references to MGS lore, which is exactly the kind of thing Kojima would do. The community didn't really bite though. 




 If you're looking for games with secret finding communities, check out the Arkham city forums/secret hunts. Recently, Rocksteady revealed an Easter egg that was hidden for *years* in Arkham city, despite the fact that the game had a very active secret hunting community (especially after Rocksteady did the same thing with Asylum), the code for AC was pretty difficult to decipher too, unlike for GTA V, so when the guy found the most recent egg (AFTER he found basically every wall with no collision detection in the game) he must have been pretty shocked. 




 Well, the race of larger than average people are never named, but they're clearly separate from humanity (not descended from the furtive pygmy), and are relatively powerless compared to say, Velka, who takes a more conventional 'God' role of manipulating stuff/ not having a human form. Who's to say that the Gods in dark souls are really God's, and not just half giants whom were called Gods by a Humanity which knows nothing better? Perhaps the chosen undead is a vessel to punish these blasphemers? 




 Probably the ultimate demonstration of this is him shooting Darkseid with a gun in Final Crisis, essentially killing him. 




 The vagrant wiki page 




 Ornstein is too tall to be a human, even ciaran apparently isn't human. 




 Vagrants spawn in set locations though, so everyone who dies in that area has a vagrant spawn on that spot. 




 But within the context of the *game* it's not presented in a humorous way, whether or not you think Kojima has the 'credibility' to present such a scene, or whether or not you think that Kojima has mishandled sexuality in the past,thus making him a hypocrite doesn't change the fact that in ground zeroes, it *is* represented negatively, and not in positive light. I think it's perfectly valid to claim GZ or MGS is disturbing or sexist or whatever, but not because of the sexual elements Kojima included in a decades old game. If you're going to claim that, why not claim that Jim sterling shouldn't be able to say anything or sex, considering that he said all that sexist stuff a few years back, and had a podcast which almost entirely consisted of him sexually harassing Jonathon Holmes? 




 It's a fantastic read. The making of the Room is even more bizarre and weird than you would expect, particularly as Wiseau spent millions of dollars on the film. 




 No, I was just wondering why you thought that the bomb was the objectionable part in ground zeroes, rather than pazes poorly written treatment in that game as a whole. Why do you that sexual harassment being played for laughs in one game shows that it's played for laughs (or titillation in another game? Those elements aren't played humorously in ground zeroes, particularly in the "context" of the game itself. Ground zeroes is a very hamfistedly written game, but that doesn't make things like Paz getting raped sexist. 




 Chie and the protagonist (I think) from persona 4, a PS2/vita visual novel/dating/jrpg game. 




 Ha, and on the very day I decided to re-read the disaster artist. 




 Every Hanz zimmer song must by necessity be re-used over and over by television companies trying to make things more 'epic'. Can't wait for Interstellar to be overused too. 




 You've also got characters like Para-medic, who's a female character who is never sexualized, and has an almost entirely platonic relationship with snake. I think it's cool that the MGS game include these elements, as opposed to games that just include a token action girl or whatever. 




 I'm not sure why these elements, other than quiets costume, are inherently sexist (we also don't know why quiet dresses like that/gets tortured yet, whilst I think it will almost certainly be given a bullshit reasoning, we should probably wait for that)


If you're bringing up Ground zeroes, why not bring up the audio tape where the villain forces a kid to rape a much older girl? That game had a shitton of awkward, hamfisted sexuality elements. 




 MGS3 also had para-medic, who is my favorite example of a male/female platonic relationship in a game, and EVA, who was deliberately sexualizing herself to steal nuclear pans for China, which she succeeds in, although YMMV on how progressive that is. Whilst I think that Kojima *does* include some sexism in his games, the games do also have some progressive element. (at least, for a videogame) Hell, you had a romance minigame with Kaz in peace walker. 




 I honestly think Burch was trying to humiliate GG in his original tweet, because the way he specifies Dtoids DLC scores seems like a trap. Dtoid actually gave relatively low scores to the borderlands 2 Dlc, in particular, the  [sir hammerlocks big game hunt review] (http://www.destructoid.com/review-borderlands-2-sir-hammerlock-s-big-game-hunt--242877.phtml) is *very* disparaging of Burch and his writing. I'm really surpised so few people brought this review up. 




 GG seems to be incapable of saying good AAA game is bad because of it's 'SJW agenda.' If they think that liberals are supposedly warping the industry to pursue a 'liberal agenda' they would be attacking Dragon Age and Borderlands and Metal Gear, which are games that go out of their way to be inclusive to people, but they apparently the don't care about ethics enough to let it stop them enjoying games, despite their arguments to the contrary. 




 He did, he kept getting dicked about by the studios for it though. It was announced alongside Hulk and Iron man. 




 Well, it was 'his' movie when he started making it before the MCU even started. 




 Yeah, I did think about amending that whilst writing it. To me, Hornets are inferred by the fireflies and that jazz (It's never really indicated that insects are any different) and a Hawk is shown on the Hawk ring, and I think may be referenced in some capacity elsewhere. Crows are also a pretty common element in Lordran, so we can sort of assume hawks would be able to survive as well (everything in Lordran would kill a regular lion, as shown by how wolves have adapted) 




 So just a bit of lore based speculation. But I've been pondering recently about Ornstein, more specifically, his totem animal, the Lion (or Leo) is a weird exception to the naming rules of the four knights, not only is it the only four knights animal we never see in the game, but it's also the only one given a Latin name, which gave me an interesting idea.

What if lions are fictional in the world of Dark souls?

Think about it, the only thing in the game that comes CLOSE to being lion-like is the Chimera (sanctuary guardian) and the big cats in darkwood, which are both fairly monstrous. How would a lion be capable of existing in Lordran? Ornstein, a famous trophy collector, would surely have some representation of his favorite beast if it were to exist. This adds a interesting dimension to his character, perhaps he looked upon the Chimera and dreamed of a lion, maybe his mother  told him of the man eating monster known as Leo to keep him up at night, hell, maybe, the sanctuary Guardians are actually his pets, which are known as 'Leos' in the world of Lordran, and their deaths cut him off from the world.

It's probably bullshit, but it's my kind of bullshit. 




 I'm pretty sure they never stop coming. 




 Both Jim Sterling, Yahtzee, and Jonathon Holmes have been talking about how Bayonetta a negative female character in their opinion (I saw it a lot on my twitter feed a week ago, as well as comments from Elsa from the Dtoid community) BUT they also stressed that it's perfectly fine to disagree with that viewpoint. 




 Malmo forgets and forgives :( 




 rated PG-13 




 You can find the more synthy version on Itunes. (at least, I think it is) The song is written and performed by metric, who were the real life inspiration for Clash at demonhead, All of their songs have a similar style ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtd8ArvH_s)  




 Because metric wrote the song. I believe you can find the more synthy version on Itunes anyway. Metrics pretty great too, they have a lot of songs like black sheep. 




 Like what happened with the animated film in the 70's? 




 Although not as badly as the third person review. Those sound effects.... 




 Dwarf fortress is basically all about weaponising babies. 




 And the voice acting, which needs to British to keep consistency with xenoblade. 




 So Destructoid is retroactively wrong for saying the game MIGHT be good, and nominating it for two categories where I'm guessing that every game of the type was there? 




 "Oh Gee, I'm so happy my SURFACE PRO TABLET from MICROSOFT CORPORATION allows me to speak to my friends on SKYPE whilst also playing FIFA with me mates on my XBOX ONE, supplied by the kind folks at MICROSOFT" 









 I was mocking people who thought various plot points were too complicated, such as the Doctor and Clara lying to each other. To me, these elements were easy to understand, and not really the issues they were being claimed to be. However, maybe I just hold too much stock in viewing audiences that I expect them to understand these plot points from my perspective. That's genuinely my bad, I'm sorry. 




 When did I ever say those were the plotholes my hypothetical redditor was referring to? I mean, you do understand I was referring to the absurdity of the complaints, because the way you said "I don't think they did?" in regards to Gallifrey really makes me think that you thought I actually didn't know it wasn't meant to be there (Although I saw a lot of confused people on the discussion thread, which I thought was absurd) 




 She was as flesh out as she needed to be that you felt bad when she died, that's all that was needed. 




 Yes there was, the doctor said she was going to be a companion in earshot of Missy and she killed her. The audience is attached to her, so when she dies it shows how bad Missy is. Whats not to get? 




 I can't believe a character I LIKED dies in a TV show, and I felt bad! What terrible, terrible writing! 




 Judging from the discussion thread, this made a lot of viewers into ten year olds again

MUM why were the doctor and Clara both lying?

MUM why did the master escape gallifrey?

MUM why is it so boooooorrrrinng?

MUM why did Osgood die?

MUM did the master die?

MUM why is the master a girl now?

MUM why did they bring back Gallifrey?

Seriously, its like people were watching the episode taking notes on which plot holes they could complain about to get Reddit points. Sure the episode had problems, like the out of place scene with the portal to heaven at the end, but the bulk of it was great, emotional stuff.
 




 I think it's better to keep lautrec alive from a story perspective. Having him kill Anastasia and then having to fight him to get her soul back is much cooler than kicking him off a cliff, and is relatively intuitive.  




 Konami let's Kojima do whatever the hell he wants, they killed castlevania, they killed silent hill, Kojima is the last Bastion of konami's game dev division, if they were really that worried about backlash, they'd have taken out the child rape in GZ. 




 Well, TPP isn't really that much bigger than mgs2, and that twist didn't ruin Kojimas career, despite the fact that Raiden was widely hated. 




 Fantastic, I really appreciate the effort. Just a quick question, but is anything major from a lore perspective equivalent to say, Kaathe from DS locked behind world tendency? 




 IT's on sale for 3.49 on the PSN store right now. 




 Yeah, I just played through the first level at level 1 without dying, so it is pretty easy, that said, I'm still really enjoying it, particularly the reveal of the sanctuary kid. 




 Since I downloaded it digitally do you mind giving me a quick heads up on world and character tendency? 




 So I'm a big Dark souls fan who just bought demon souls in the PSN halloween sale, do you guys have any advice/pitfalls I may fall into after having played Dark souls? Where do the key differences lie? 




 All over my pancakes 




 Sorry, I only have enough flour and eggs to make syntax error pancakes. 




 You don't have to watch anything, but I DO recommend checking out the madoka tv tropes page, particularly the 'YMMV' page. It explains a lot of stuff about the madoka fandom before the movie was out. 




 It sure was an incredible coincidence that the captain happened to be bluffing when Duncan roled a two. I'm glad Duncans SKILL helped him out in that situation 




 My headcanon is that Bloodborne is set in Carim, the continent that gets mentioned in dark souls, the Continent of treachery and deception, and the worshipers of Velka, god of crows. 




 You should definitely check out the series. The first 2 metal gear games are a tad dated, but are still great games, and do begin the story of the series. MGS is the MSX scaled up a bit with fancier graphics and excellent cutscenes, MGS2 was well ahead of its time in terms of game storytelling, even if it is one of the weirdest and trolliest games ever made, MGS3 is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest action adventure/stealth games ever, MGS 4 is mainly a capper to the series, and peace walker is another amazing game gameplay wise, but has a simpler story. It's really worth checking out the series. 




 Yeah, It's presence on this sub and Lewis and sips twitter feed has been practically non-existent. Did you also know that they also play Civ 5? I would never know that if I just followed this sub! 




 Perfect Blue. You know the movie Black Swan? a metric tonne of its content was taken from this movie. It's also one of Terry Gilliams favorites!  




 Thanks for the late reply, I really appreciate it! 




 It's one of the best farming spots in the game, too. Just cast poioson fog on the clumped up undead or do an AOE and you'll get thousands of souls each time.  




 That's exactly what Kojima *would* say if he was covering it up! 




 Well, one could argue that you should have really dodged out of the way at that close a range, or at least kept a fair distance so not EVERY bead hit you. The dark bead further imbalances an unbalanced game, but the since the only way to get a 'proper' duel is if the other guy plays ball (doesn't gank or use some nonsense AOE, has a perfect internet connection etc) Other than that, the DLC is probably the best part of the game anyway. 




 Well, dark Bead IS a pretty rare and obscure power, at least for the first few months of the DLC release, and it's hardly like Dark souls is that well balanced in the first place. 




 I actually thought the boss fights were pretty fantastic as a stealth combat character. In particular, that boss felt like a highlight to me, as he has fairly low health but you're empowered. 




 Ah, but it's already happened! Think of all the feelings that will be released in players hearts! It will be magnificent! 




 Yeah, I really hope we get to see para-medic in TPP because I'm assuming her betrayal of big boss hit the hardest. 




 MGS 3 still had the top down view at launch. It wasn't until substinence that it became the best game in the series, and it's kind of difficult to give a re-release a 10/10. 




 The twin gargoyles isn't impossibly difficult, the second only appears when the first is at 50% health, and solaire gives them more health anyway. The baldur knights and armored boar are far trickier at that stage in the game. 




 Nope, trying to continue the joke! 









 I think they shied off from making ghost rider tie-ins in event books after he basically won World War Hulk on his own, but chose to let hulk live. 




 Have you fought Artorias? He pretty badly overshadows gwyn in the 'have a proper swordfight' department. 




 Eh, I personally feel that we should wait for the second cour to get a full picture before we judge it. I feel that the duality between Slaine and Inaho was played up nicely and contrasted with the princess/rayet parallels.  




 I like Inaho because he is, or potentially is, an interesting character. He's essentially a cold, calculating, sociopath who happens to be fighting for the good guys. If he came back, after being shot by Slaine, he's probably do way worse stuff to the martians, and that would be neat to watch.

 ' former roboteers from SPECIFICALLY the first series of the UK robot wars, what was it like to deny an opponent the unquenchable thirst of battle by beating them in the pinball round?' 




 The DLC wasn't ever really intended to be conventional DLC either, it was meant to be a bonus for PC gamers. Although because of this, PC gamers didn't discover what amounted to the best area of the game for ages, which made the poor PC port more apparent.  




 To be fair, democracy v anarchy WAS where the majority of the lore and conflict came from. 




 Even though the PC version was bad... it was totally worth it for the artorias DLC. 




 You'll also want to see if you can summon solaire for the fight, and get an xbox controller. The game is NOT designed for keyboard at all, and is unnecessarily hard using it. 




 Because all cut scenes are in engine, which allow's for some neat things like custom gear appearing on you're characters, even in flashbacks. It's similar with a lot of RPG's, you just don't notice so much in stuff like WOW or FFX 




 Shulks in the trailers though. 




 It's due to getting the game to run on the systems. You can't have such massive explorable areas without making a few compromises to textures in the foreground. 




 Looking forward to fans saying every video CONFIRMS YOGPOD RETURNING! instead now. 




 The TOTG is pretty close to the second kiln, isn't it? Perhaps the blast from the kiln reached the Tomb, hence why there's so many worshipping skeletons in Nito's room, who were probably frozen in place when the blast hit. I personally doubt that Nito has anything to do with the curse of undeath. The curse is clearly meant to be alien to the other forms of undead in Lordran, such as the skeletons (body, but no mind) and ghosts, (Mind, but no body) the whole reason for Nito's lack of power is that people have stopped dying conventionally, in fact, one of the themes in dark souls is that *hundreds* of factions (all the covenants, all the nations, the demons, the skeletons, the darkwraiths, seath Gwyn) are powerless in the face of the curse of undeath, and nobody knows who's causing it. 




 Although I have been mobbed by anti abortion campaigners in my British school, so I wouldn't say it's not an issue. However, I don't see why it's interpreted as an analogy for abortion when it's really a pretty basic 'utilitarianism doesn't hold all the answers' analogy. 




 Eh, my personal problem with listen was that it's not ambiguous enough. The alternative explanations make sense to the CHARACTERS, but they don't make sense to the audience. The characters get no evidence the monster exists, but the audience get a tonne, to discount the monster existing, we not only have to assume the characters train of thought, but take the perspective that the CAMERA is lying. We see a hand grabbing people under their beds, we seen a 'child' act nothing like a child and have an alien face. We have to assume that Doctor wrote 'listen' on a blackboard for no reason offscreen, and we have to assume the semi-easter egg of the pressure door subtly whispering 'listen' didn't actually happen. The episode is supposedly ambiguous, but the audience has to mental gymnastics to make it so. 




 DOES LIQUID HAVE PREP TIME?!?!?!? 




 Well, before the boss room (The area with the baby skeletons) you can see that Nito had  a LOT of worshipers, so Gravelords might also have been pretty popular. 




 ah, that sword scaling does make sense. 




 Gough still has huge strength in order to use his greatbow, In fact, all of Gwyns archers favor strength by using greatbows

Artorias doesn't have stats in everything, he's clearly not a magic user. His armor could also be said to be fairly gender neutral too. 

Ornstein is still working for Gwyn, or at least using the Armour that Gwyn gave him. He also has a pretty androgynous armour, so much so that many players though he was a girl in the first few trailers. The silver and black Knights armour is definitely more Masculine than androgynous too,a t least for me, although YMMV on that. 




 I was gonna point them out, showing how mildred is one of the few females usin a melee build, and how she doesn't work for Gwyn. Laurentus is also the only spellcaster who doesn't wear feminine clothing, which further corroborates it a bit. 




 I'm only semi trolling. Everyone under Gwyns command that has a dex or INT based build has a noticeably feminine armor set, even his son, gwyndolin, whereas everyone who uses a strengh/faith build has way more masculine armor. 




 I think it's more to do with Gwyns weird approach to gender. Everyone who uses a DEX or magic build HAS to wear a dress, because only women can do those things, and we need to make you as much of a woman as possible to fool people! 




 Thank goodness, the speculation was getting *silly* 




 As, so the multiple duncans were all just a blip in the system. Glad to have all that speculation cleared up. 




 Ha, I did the same thing on my first playthrough till I got my ornstein gear. It still amazes me how you can run up stairs without falling over. Interestingly enough, that gear belongs to the best spellcaster in the lore after Gwyndolin, so it kind of live up to those stats. 




 Yeah, but I don't think that's such a huge flaw to make the entire episode the 'worst ever'. I enjoyed the whole utilitarianism conflict and stuff.
