 Okay, just unsubscribed, you can go back to preaching to the choir now, seems to be all you really wanted to do anyway.  




 Just pointing out that a little over half those suicides in the U.S. are also gun deaths, so saying that there are more suicides than gun deaths isn't exactly accurate. 




 A gun shot is thought to be the most common and effective way to commit suicide, and accounts for 53.7% of all suicides in the United States.

http://www.suicidemethods.net/suicide-methods/ 




 and yet in your past you did not have school shooting.

The earliest known U.S. school shooting was the Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four men entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed schoolmaster Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children (reports vary). Only three children survived. 




 The lapels and ties of the two gentlemen on the right, closest to the signage, would make me think it's about 1962-63, but the younger gentleman on the left is sporting a slightly wider tie and lapels, suggesting '66-67 maybe.

 Well, shutting down the government would certainly make it harder to deport five million people. 




 By that logic, OP is best buds with Peter Suderman. 




 She'll probably leave them for Bill to wear when he's the First Lady.  




 Guess they should have actually voted then. 




 So, he's still working at Fox? Someone told me he got fired sometime ago.

 But, there aren't any Southerners in Ohio and there aren't any Republicans in the Democratic Party?

 So, can we stop asking "What if there was an election and nobody voted?"  




 I don't see how ranked-choice voting would have changed anything for me on Tuesday. In nine of fourteen races there was only one person running and in the other five, there were only two. No third parties or independents on the ballot at all.  



















 Guy sounds like Ron from GTA 5. 




 I don't know how you got that I thought people were "abusing it to get stoned on their couch", I'm talking about them getting stoned and driving a forklift. If you're being treated chronic/life-threatening conditions, you probably not going to be unloading trucks anyway.  




 They could fire me for taking pain meds, if I haven't been prescribed pain meds and some people are prescribed Vicodin, but those people are usually told that they can no longer work.

 Your problem is that you think you are a "Big Man" and that there are "Little People", who for some reason, are not as "Big" as you are. 




 I wonder if this most is intended to

a) Make me not like Ice Cube because he is a Muslim?

or

b) Make like Islam because Ice Cube is a Muslim?

because I really can't see how someone holding a relatively common religious belief is all that interesting.  




 Oh now I get it, the early bird gets the worm and everyone else must suck his dick. Winner takes all. King of the hill. Dog eats dog, right? 




 Yea, donating or learning more does help. 




  And nobody would be able to avoid paying it like they do now.

Yes they would, by making as few transactions as possible, which is why it wouldn't stimulate the economy or create jobs. 




 If you think for one minute that corporations are going to say "Oh look, more profit, should we give it to our customers or our shareholders" you will have proven P.T. Barnum right.   




  They would become richer.

So you concede that only those who already have money would benefit? 

 Well, when your paycheck increases from no longer paying income taxes, how so?

When the increase in the amount you pay for food, rent, electricity, water, gas, socks, soap, toilet paper and toothpaste is greater than your income tax burden was because you no longer have deductions. 




 Stone don't kill people, people do. 




 A consumption tax? How would raising the price of everything stimulate the economy and create jobs? In the long run it would have the same negative effects on the economy as raising the minimum wage would but none of the positives. 









  an anti-war and anti-corporate Republican 

Can you name one?

 




 And yet you still find time to renew your licence? How about an absentee ballot? 




 I went at 7:30 AM and was in   out in less than 10 min. and my polling place is inside my local elementary school. 




 Capitalism is like beer, one are two a day is better for health than if you drank none at all, but a case a day will kill you before your time and then some folks are alcoholics.

Edit: I didn't even have a beer yet and I still used "are" for "or". 




 "re-election bid" as in the Arizona Senate seat he now holds.  




 The fact nearly 2 in 3 didn't even vote might have something to do with that. 









 She shook 'em off. 




 Still unasked is the obvious question, why are whites who formerly voted Democrat, now voting Republican?    




 Is the President not allowed to have private conversations? 




 You folks know that shit got cancelled, right?

 You mean Johnsoncaid and Johnsoncare? 




 And they didn't repeal the interstate either.

 Your title should be comprised only of the copied and pasted headline of the article and/or exact quotes. The selection of quotes should reflect the article as a whole. 




 The most likely reason is that this model truck isn't even sold in the U.S. and it would be a waste of money to advertise a product that you do not even sell. 




 I think that was Rambo. 




 That one on the left though. 




 You'd like to have options others don't? 




 Actually about half the ballot in Alabama is like the Senate race, Republican incumbent vs nobody. You people want a third party, hell I just wish I still had two.   




 Check my zip code, 36116. In most of the races, I don't even have a choice between one of the two parties, only one, much less a third choice. 









 He literally just sold a white family to a tobacco farmer in Virginia yesterday.   




 Naw, can't be. If people are disagreeing with my opinions, it must be because someone is paying them to do it.   




 Yes, his ex-wife was opposed U.S. military interventions in other countries.  



















 The owners of Walmart are the richest people in America aren't they? Doesn't the U.S. have progressive tax rates? 




 So we're only paying like 20% more for gas today than we were a hundred years ago?

"No!"

 Respect, actually looking people in the eyes and saying "good morning", not "sup". Getting off your phone when you go in a restaurant or store, acknowledging the cashier or waitstaff as being a human being and not an ATM or something. Asking if you can take a picture first.

 I don't see why anyone cares? How is UPS going to victimize you with this information? Are they going to tell your boss what kind of car your uncle drives if you don't give them your lunch money? 




 Columbus Day, it's like celebrating the day a rapist found their victim or something. 




 U.S. labor costs rose more than expected in the third quarter as wages recorded their largest gain since 2008, a sign that a long-awaited pick-up in wage growth was underway.

I like to mention Nixon.

 When Kalashnikov died, I posted a story from CBS news. I didn't edit the headline which used the term "assault rifle". The first and only comment was about my "poor choice of words" followed by my being banned from r/guns.   




 When I say "Public Assistance", you hear "Wealth Redistribution", I doubt that you are really open to hearing a solution and agreeing with me. 









 Nope, overqualified. :)  




 I suppose you think yourself more competent than Congress?;D  




 If your options are

a) Your child must quit school and work or they will not eat and will always be employed in a low paying job because they are uneducated and their children will also not go to school because they too must choose working over an education.

or

b) The community will pay for your child's food so that the child may remain in school, receiving an education which will allow them to make more money as an adult and not have to choose between having their children working or getting an education.

Would any parent say "No thank you, I would like my children to remain uneducated and poor"? 




  low illiteracy 

would mean that more people in those countries had received an education and could read, low *literacy* would mean fewer people could read. Is that what you meant? 




 Actually, the family is incentivized to produce educated children who will be more prosperous in adulthood and not need welfare, than children who work instead of becoming educated and will always be employed in low wage jobs.  




 Countries with low rates of literacy, have high rates of poverty. 




 Unless that family lives in in a county that provides public assistance, which was my point. 




 Compare [this map](http://www.glpinc.org/High_Literacy_Clusters/world_literacy_map_unhd_2007_2008.png), with [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Percentage_population_living_on_less_than_$2_per_day_2009.png). 




 The Bible also never condemns slavery or says that marriage is between only one man and one woman. 




 Can you name even one bible that does state that Satan rules hell? 




 Allowing a substantial portion of your labor force to remain illiterate and therefore trapped in low wage jobs is a good way make sure your economy remains poor.  




 If there is no welfare, no child labor laws, no minimum wage and no requirement of education, this is what happens.  




 
I fight authority, but authority always wins. I've been doing it since I was a young kid and I've come out grinnin', but when I fight authority, authority always wins. 




 You think they'll look anything like Karl Rove on Fox News, election night 2012? 




 Only industrious, hard working, self-supporting, bootstrappy people can live in Liberal Cities? So does that mean that the freeloading, deadbeat, 47% have to live in "Real America"?   














 No it isn't.

 So, on the one hand we got a Doctor who got a prize from the people gave Obama one for peace and on the other hand we have the CDC, ACLU   the UN? Guess who I'm going with for now? 




 So everyone could be in the one percent if they just choose to be? 




 Wait, so Fox News want me to believe that the Democratic party doesn't want Democrats to win? 




 Did he get that prize the same year as Obama? 









 When Hillary Clinton was a teenager, she canvassed and campaigned for Nixon and worked for Goldwater '64, and was even elected president of Wellesley College's Young Republicans club. Reagan was a strong FDR New Deal supporter and campaigned for Democrats in '50 and tried to get Eisenhower to run as a Democrat in '52. 









 Wow, actually says "can ignores".

 Small, well-trained governmental agencies can plan and execute near perfect plans

Why would they if

the bloated federal bureaucracy couldn't coordinate gun control measures after the fact.

If there is nothing to to gained, what's the point? 









 In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners. 

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html

If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government. 




 My problem with this is motive, I don't see how the government gained anything in Sandy Hook. What right do you not have now, that you had just before Sandy Hook? 




 Why would FEMA, the FCC   AT T want the public to think that just any random joker has the ability to hack their system and send out meaningless alerts that should be ignored by them?    




 Kamala Harris isn't Holder, would she be okay? 




 I have also heard that there was no Ebola in the U.S. until after Obamacare was passed and it may be responsible for the attack on the Canadian Parliament.    




 "You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good?

 Probably for the same reasons Republicans oppose ID's for gun purchases?  




 Wait, we should surrender unless there is irrefutable proof that we are winning?  




 Stepping down isn't accountability, finding or replacing the 263 million that went missing on your watch would be accountability.

 I'm not exactly sure how thinking I might get Ebola would cause me to not care if my bank was going to go under and take my money with it?  














 And why doesn't this happen to the Germans, Israelis and Japanese, I mean they have U.S. bases in their counties, right? According to Dr.Paul that's all that's necessary for rape, murder and torture at the hands of American troops to happen and yet it doesn't happen in those counties.   




 The reality is that our military presence in Australia, Germany, Israel and Japan don't seem to be as offensive to the people that live there as you and Dr. Paul would have us believe. 




 What if the U.S. had military bases in Australia, Germany, Israel and Japan?

[Oh Wait,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_military_bases) we do.
