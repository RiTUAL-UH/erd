 Reddit has changed. The top comment of an article was almost always the counter argument to the link. This would allow the reader to get a full perspective on the topic. Now it is usually occupied with circle jerking reinforcement (i.e, all the anti-Muslim posts over the last 36 hours).

I am not taking either side on this issue, I am just disappointed I had to scroll this far down for a counter argument.

Inb4 "le noob month old reddit account talks about the good ol days hue hue hue", I deleted my old account because it had an offensive connotation.
