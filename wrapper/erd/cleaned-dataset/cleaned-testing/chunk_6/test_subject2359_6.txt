And here's one with a T-64 following a truck with a *fucking Russian flag* in Ukraine:

  Not a single of your links shows a Russian tank

So you didn't actually go through all the links.  Got it, little Russia-bot.  How much are you getting paid to post nothing but RUSSIA-STRONK bullshit, anyways?  Because I hope it's worth the mockery and scorn you deserve.

Not to mention numerous accounts of Russian soldiers fighting on behalf of separatists, which Russia doesn't even bother denying, instead saying the soldiers were "on vacation."  Which is bullshit that you seem happy to shovel. 




  Just like those picture of Russian tanks and soldiers invading Ukraine

Those pictures that *actually exist*?  You mean those?
 




 I really wonder how many people who enjoyed this book did so out of a sense of vicarious nostalgia - that is, nostalgia for a period they didn't actually live through, but like to pretend they did.  I suspect a lot of fans of this book weren't actually alive in the '80s, or else they'd realize just how thoroughly beaten the dead horse of '80s references truly gets. 




  "the boy racers and their V8s" Which is bullshit as they don't drive those in this country

What sort of country do you live in where cars don't have V8s? 




  An example of the latter is the Adem in The Wise Man's Fear not understanding the connection between sex and pregnancy.

Well ... this one I can give a pass on.  The thing is, the world they live in doesn't function by the same rules as ours - we sure as hell don't have anything like "unbounded principles."  So I honestly wonder if the Adem are right, and everyone else is wrong.  The whole "playing music makes you a whore" thing is just bullshit, though. 




 For people who are impoverished in the real world, that first example of repetition is actually pretty depressingly ordinary.  Trust me. 




 I used it once at an ARCO station about fifteen years ago, but I've never seen it since.  Which is a shame, because it's damned convenient. 




 I'd love to wake up one day and have 1.5 thousand in my account. 




 But if it's just sloppy gun and knife work... It's not for me.

It's actually incredibly well done gun work and knife/hand fighting.  But yeah, pretty violent. 




 All he'd have to do is read the Constitution. 




 I don't think I'll watch it,

Good God, why not?  You're depriving yourself of something *awesome*. 




  "There was a supernova detected and I've got work to do."

I sure wish my life allowed me to say things like that. 




  I'm just confused as to how they think

See, it's best just to leave it at that. 




  How the McDonald's case in 1992 wasn't thrown out in the same fashion is beyond me

I'm guessing it's beyond you because you haven't actually read the details. 




 I like to think of the second one as being like what Kvothe played by the campfire in Roent's caravan. 




 Oh my God, I'm not the only one.  Though it's a 2.3Ghz single core processor and 2 gigs of ram, running 32-bit XP.  Being broke sucks. 




 Instead of the slow, plinking, dreary "chamber music" mentioned below, I prefer to think it sounds like Ronn McFarlane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDtBUePhlzU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw0fKzJQgeg


Although I guess the first one might sound a bit too ... modern.  




  I think Pat thinks we're supposed to like Denna, 

Part of this may be that *he* knows all the details about her, and forgets that we don't. 




  And smelter's flu isn't something he could catch, not really. He is a Master Linguist, not an alchemist or an artificer. I believe it is a dennar resin poison because the Medica seemed to be at a loss for how to treat him.


I didn't say he *caught* it, I said he was poisoned.  The fact that he's not an alchemist would make it that much easier.

And the Medica would recognize denner resin poison, the sickness from which wouldn't last day after day.  From Wil and Sim's description of alchemy, the Medica can't really do much about the nastier or more subtle stuff. 




 Possibly ... but it's more important that *the Maer* describes her that way, not Kvothe. 




 Denna doesn't visit Kvothe at the University itself, she visits him at Anker's, a place she's been to plenty of times before.

And Herma's illness sounds a lot more like smelter's flu or some other form of alchemical poisoning, leading me to believe it was done by Ambrose and/or Hemme to put Hemme in the Chancellor's chair. 




 It's still up in the air.  An off-hand comment by the Deputy Prime Minister is not binding.

http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russia_announces_plan_to_build_new_space_station_with_NASA_999.html 




 That article is almost a year old, and didn't wind up happening.  The current commander (Expedition 43) of the ISS is American Terry Virts; on board as well is One Year astronaut Scott Kelly, who will be a part of Expedition 44 and Commander of Expeditions 45   46. 




  After banning american astronauts,

What reality did this happen in?  Because ... not ours. 




 I realize the reddit demographic skews towards the teenaged/college aged who view anyone pushing 30 as being positively ancient, but "young" can quite well be used to describe someone in their late twenties, or even early thirties.  Shocking, I know. 




  When I was 16 like he is now I had to solder most of my parts to the mobo,

Yeah ... in 2005.  Right.  I've been building my own for ten years longer than that, from the case on up, and have never soldered a damn thing. 




 Why hasn't Sputniknews been banned as a source yet? 




 Nothing like wandering into a thread and seeing 83 [comment deleted]s.  Because I know I'm not seeing a whole bunch of BS, unlike in /r/history. 




 I remember seeing these pictures in National Geographic in elementary school in the '80s. 




 This strikes me as exactly the sort of thing the LCS would be good for, in a supporting role. 




 That ... that very well may be the best CO *ever*. 




 FWIW, I'm actually from Chester.  And Quincy is great - I love the downtown, and how walkable it is, especially around that stately old courthouse.  The FRC campus is also beautiful, on the forested hillside and right next to that meadow. 




  Digital Path?

Digital Path user here (in Chester).  Fuck Digital Path. 




 "Drug deals and crime" doesn't quite sum up Westwood.  "Meth, stray dogs, and pregnant 15 year-olds" however, does.  

It's gotten slightly better in the past few years, but it's still sort of a squalid little redneck town.  Young's Market is nice, especially since they slice their bacon thick, but expect to pay a lot for gas at the two whole gas stations available (gas prices in both Westwood and Chester tend to be about 50 cents more than the California average).  Buffalo Chips makes decent pizza, and there's a couple of other good places to eat (the Old Mill Cafe being the standout), but precisely dick for entertainment.  There's no in-town bank, just an ATM.  Also, the library sucks, even for a small town.

It's pretty much just a pit-stop for people going somewhere else, both short-term and long-term.  If you're looking to move there ... well, don't 




 The lack of snow is kind of disturbing.  I mean, there might be some more this week, but ... things are pretty bare in the Park for mid-April. 




  as long as you trick yourself into believing that you're struggling to follow the story because Erickson's storytelling is just miles of every other author

Or, maybe, some of us didn't struggle to follow the story. 




 Try reading 1493 by Charles C. Mann - it really goes into the transfer of potatoes from South America to Europe.  Along with a lot of other great stuff. 




  I can't believe people actually want single cabs by choice

Why not?  It allows better rearward visibility, and you don't accumulate as much crap by continually shoving more into the back of the cab. 




  You can throw an old VW Beatle about 1.5 miles.

This needs to be done. 




 What's the hardest part about putting a baby in a blender?

My erection. 




 I think maybe you should learn English, before posting on reddit.

But it was probably pudding day in the special school you go to, so I can understand if you were too excited to spell correctly, or use particular words in their correct places. 




 There's a certain fundamental stupidity that is embodied by people who don't understand that diplomacy has a place, even between adversaries.  The U.S. negotiated and signed disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union, a nation that was literally arming other countries fighting and killing American soldiers, a nation that had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads aimed at us.

But the modern Republican betwetting, pants-shitting, sociopathing neocons are blind to history.  They only know that the scary Kenyan Muslim darkie who stole the White House thanks to ACORN is bowing down to Tehran and gifting the Ayatollah with the nukes he'll use to destroy the 51st American state of Israel by ... negotiating to delay Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Or something.  It apparently doesn't have to make sense, outraging Republicans is now as simple as not killing funny-talking brown people. 




 Northern California, nothing really south of Sacramento. 

I'm looking for a nice city that has a good job market for IT and a good nerd and japanese culture with a nice art community.

These are mutually exclusive. 




  In February it was -15 or some shit, and in July or August we can hit 95. That's 110 degrees difference.

In California, you can possibly do that on the same day - camp high up on the southern High Sierra at 10,000-12,000 feet where it gets fucking cold at night, and then drive down to Death Valley fifty miles away to bask in the sun. 




  Ambrose finds out Kvothe has been stealing much of his tuition, and finds a way to prove the crime to Chancellor Hemme,

I think it's going to be a lot simpler - Ambrose will find a way to prove that Kvothe made a gram, using runes that are off limits to a Re'lar.  Remember, the stories say that Kvothe was kicked out of the University for "stealing secret magics." 




 Cedar is fine for kindling, but burns up too fast to use as a good source of heat - you need a *lot* of it, volume wise, to get the same heat as from a smaller volume of other woods. 




 Redwood actually burns really well, if quickly.  Whenever I can snag some leftovers from a construction project, or have some left over from a project of my own, I burn it. 




 Sounds like a crazy person who might have taken a geology class once at a community college ... or just seen a National Geographic show on earthquakes.  Definitely doesn't sound like someone with any kind of degree. 




 This is completely and utterly wrong about pine.  It's perfectly fine to use as your sole source of firewood (a lot of people where I live, including myself, do so).  The sap content doesn't really matter when seasoned, and I have no idea what "burns messy" is supposed to mean - it doesn't really generate more ash or creosote than oak or almond. 




  And 'Shitting Dick Nipples' off the list of things I didn't think existed on the Internet.

Really?  That's been around forever in Internet years. 




 Oh, it was worse than that for the Soviets.  At this time, the U.S. had about 220 ICBMs, the Soviets ... 4, 2 of which were experimental.  As well, the U.S. had 9 SSBNs in service, with the rather capable Polaris 1A SLBM (range of 1000 miles), while the Soviets had a haphazard scattering of converted subs with short ranged missiles that had to be launched from the surface.  That, and all the IRBMs that the U.S. had stationed in NATO countries very close to the Soviet border, whereas the Soviets just had whatever they'd installed in Cuba.  

The only nukes likely to get through to the U.S. would've been the ones launched from Cuba, and those probably only would've been used if they were in the process of being bombed. 




  and that such an event would lead to nuclear Armageddon.

Given the disparity in nuclear arsenals at the time, it would've only *really* been Armageddon for the Soviets.  It just would've really sucked for the U.S., especially the East Coast. 




 Or making Caesar Dressing. 




 God, I loved those.  I remember the one with Descent on it.  For someone with no money living in a rural area ... this was incredible. 




 I want people to start posting pictures of the ugly side of Hawaii, just to reassure me it's not all a bunch of absurd beauty. 




 Shouldn't that pants shitting draft-dodger be dead or in jail by now?  You know, by his own words?

Oh, right, forgot he's just a pants-shitting coward. 




 What does it warn you?  Not to climb so damned high? 




 Guess your secret identity as Clark Kent has just been blown. 




 Definitely a water hazard. 




 Please ... you can't trust the odometer on that thing.  4 mill, tops. 




 Can confirm.

   I don't have proof, but I know he has eaten about 100lbs of fries, left over hamburger piece, etc.

Say goodbye to his pancreas.  And, sooner than you'd like, him. 




  that ability to win is the sina qua non of democratic politics.

"We should elect him because he's good at winning elections" is a pretty damned stupid argument. 




 he may have renamed himself in such a way as to split off the fae portion of himself into a new creature.

"The Lightning Tree" doesn't support this, if you haven't read it - [Spoiler](/s "It's written from Bast's perspective, and he definitely existed before he met Kvothe.") 




 I can actually see how some of them might not be - Hemme, Brandeur, Lorren, Herma, and to a lesser extent Arwyl wouldn't need to be full arcanists to run their departments.  

They could've attended the University when they were younger, learning certain basic principles, then went out into the world and attained great stature and fame in their respective fields, then be brought back by the University to be Masters teaching in those fields.  Naming, Artificing, Sympathy, and Chemistyr/Alchemy would of course require a full arcanist's level of talent and knowledge.  

But Archiving, Rhetoric   Logic, Mathematics, Linguistics, and perhaps Medicine ... these are things where the rest of the Four Corners might offer just as much opportunity for learning and accomplishment as the University.  Someone like Chronicler could potentially be brought back as Master Archivist after another twenty years of gaining repute, for example. 




  I think our bitterness about the 2000 Western Conference Finals might be one of the few things we agree on. 

If there's one thing Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, Red States and Blue States, pro-Choice and pro-Life, hawks, neocons, peacenicks, dirty fucking hippies and chickenhawk warmongers can come together, join hands, sing Kumabya,  and agree on, it's that the Kings got seriously fucked in Game Six.

Hell, I'm still pissed about how Doug Christie's face managed to foul Kobe Bryant's elbow a couple years later.  How the shit? 




   Of the records, the best is Scott Walker's, who won 3 elections in 4 years

Maybe you should evaluate him on his accomplishments in office, not on his ability to win elections.

 




  Walsh might soon be replaced by Bochy or Posey though

That's some serious recency bias. 




 The quick and easy way to tell the difference is that the Burkes don't have a RAM launcher. 




 Tracers are a form of incendiary round - it's just not their specific purpose. 




 Carl's Jr. and Hardee's comes to mind. 




 Tracers can. 




 Because they were using machine guns, there would've been tracers (which are incindiary) mixed in with the ball cartridges. 




 How do you not understand basic math?  Just ... how?  If the other countries have our tax rates but their workers make a lot less, the corporation pays less to the workers!  Less = not as much.  That's like 2+2 =4, but you're insisting that 2+2 = Elephant. 




 So ... if there was no nuclear deal, the Iranians *wouldn't* be buying these weapons?  Is that what Israel is claiming?  Because that makes absolutely no sense. 




 No ... no, it can't.  If Country A and Country B both have 10% payroll and 35% corporate taxes, but Country B has a median income that's significantly lower than A's, corporations in A save money by outsourcing to B.  Period.

You don't understand math, at all. 




 ... you're just not very bright, are you? If another country has the same payroll and corporate tax rates as we do, but the workers only get paid 1/10th as much ... guess what happens? 




 I don't think you know how percentages work.  Or payroll.  Or economics.  Or causality. 




 That's the thing that would break MULTIVAC. 




 That doesn't even make sense.  Corporates don't offshore because of employee payroll taxes, they do it because they can get the same productivity for 10% of the labor costs.  A slight drop in their payroll taxes (other countries have taxes too, you know) is hardly a big motive. 




 "Because I want to be President."

Pretty sure that's about it. 




   Let's be honest false flag attacks are bread and butter of the political left.

And I love the way you provide so very many examples. 




  MSNBC gave fucking Al Sharpton his own show.

They also gave right-winger and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough his own show, which continues today. 




  Our tax structure didn't send manufacturing overseas.

Our tax structure doesn't send manufacturing overseas, cheap labor does. 




 Probably the sort of sanctions that the Iranians are desperate to get lifted right now, given the effect on their economy. 




  Let's be honest false flag attacks are bread and butter of the political left.

Except ... they aren't.  They're extremely rare.  There's no real equivalent of James O'Keefe or backwards-B girl on the left. 




 You people are making me jealous - my old B2150 has got a lot of hours on it, but I can't afford anything newer.

Also, those swing arms make it a bitch to switch from an augur to anything else. 




  Bast's understanding (perception?) of Ctaeh is clearly based on legends and stories

Which is probably very, very deliberate on someone's part.  I wouldn't be surprised if Fae children are raised with these stories to keep them from seeking out the Cthaeh.  It probably really can see almost everything, which makes it dangerous to talk to - so, you'd want to discourage that, by really amping up what it's capable of.  The Sithe probably know that the Cthaeh doesn't actually know the future, but the fact that it knows everything in the present is bad enough.
 




  This is literally the lowest geographical area the United States has.

Well, there is that absurdly high-res dot-map, where each dot represents something like 1,000 people. 




 This sentence is a lie. 




  should his life be ruined as well.

Yes.  The answer you're looking for is "yes." 




 Goddamn that's an awesome picture.  The Tomcat just looks brutal. 




 Kvothe is already famous in-retelling at the end of TWMF, and it's pretty obvious he sees Skarpi again after that.  As well, I just can't imagine he doesn't track down Abenthy once he's out of the University - it would be a logical step. 




 For the first question, that goddamned fucking "I'm a lonely boy" song.  I don't even know what it's called, just that the whining singer repeats that over and over.  Heard it at the store the other day, made me want to punch babies in the face. 




 Things look pretty cool from up there.  Enjoy the view, if you have a window seat.

If you don't ... I don't know.  Just don't whimper and cry, it bothers the rest of us. 




 Sure, if the vacuum suddenly stabilized.

Have fun sleeping knowing that all of existence might end instantaneously. 




 Hand grenades and .357 Magnum, fully loaded.

They have to give me what I want, right? 




 If I knew, I wouldn't fucking be drunk, alone, and redditing. 




 Because we're anonymous, and there's no real-life consequences to our assholery. 

... well, usually.  We don't make very good detectives. 




 You seriously think he's the only one? 




 Holy fuck, like we could possibly get any more virgin in here. 




 That's all it took?  Man, appropriate username. 




 Oaks get cut down and turned into furniture. 




  This is my "fuck I'm dumb" moment/

So at least you'll have a good response for that inevitable /r/AskReddit thread. 




  Skarpi and Kvothe after he became famous
 Abenthy and Kvothe after he became famous ("look at what you have unleashed on the world")

We're almost certainly going to see both of these after Kvothe gets expelled. 




 Sour cream and a lot of Tobasco sauce - makes for a really great dip for chips. 




 Hey, look everyone, we found that one guy! 




 Bukowski was an effete urban poet who was rated 4-F by the draft-board.  Hemmingway was a hard-bitten fighter who worked with his hands, and got those hands dirty, and would beat the ever living hell out of Bukowski. 




 Cleaned shit off the top of a toilet lid.

Seriously, they couldn't even bother to lift the lid.  Anyone who's worked at a place with a public bathroom has no doubt encountered this.
