 This is one of my favorite episodes. Everything Marshal does at the party is amazing 




 Well Robin still seems to hang out with Barney when he's teaching Randy how to live. I doubt Lily ever really hangs out with Barney and Marshal is usually with Lily

I do feel that Ted would be more mad with Robin though, not just shrugging it off 




 This honestly sounds worse than anything the kids would be doing 




 Used to work at a McWalmart. Would not recommend  




 Maybe the flag glasses are deceiving  




 The Seattle native in me has to say that there is much more things that are "worthwhile" to do in Seattle than those, not that those aren't fun either 




 Lost it by the gas station by Stephenson.  It's a gray vans wallet. I posted on CL too but if anyone finds it I'll give them a reward.  Thanks   Go Cougs 




 This has one of my favorite quotes from Barney

"Was the Blair Witch easy to deal with or did she haggle over the closing cost" 




 I've had some life changing epiphanies in there 




 And you're an anti-dentite! 




 ITT: Wegmans 




 My guess is oxidized piss 




 That *is* a tasty burger

 I love how they attempt to get back into formation while also fleeing for their lives
 




 ehh they were probably gonna die anyways 




 It is fun, by senior year though it all starts to sound the same. If you're a freshman though go and enjoy it! 




 Why does everyone hate this episode so much? I think it's far from the worst

the part that always bothers me is Lily's terrible gun handling skills 




 Lately it seems the "cool" thing to do is like the ending regardless of original opinions of it 




 I loved the finale and have never heard the whole dead theory, then again I'm 22 so wasn't really aware when the show was airing. I really like this explanation though 




 Well there goes the next 48 hours of my life 




 That chicken is oddly proportioned 




 Good, I get paid in potato 




 It amazes me how many people here (in WA) think that just because its legal doesn't mean employers won't test for it and turn people down 




 S2 E10, James wears that same tie.  




 This is what the infinite staircase felt like we^just^need^the^music 




 the opposite of fine 




 Suitjamas I believe 




 Do I get a vote? Skank lane! Skank lane! 




 This makes me sad too because I think he's a great actor. he just got caught up in Pirates far too long 




 People would always dare others to do this and I'm like 'I'd do this anyways'  




 HIMYM and 30 Rock I thought both had great hooks from the start 














 If you've never read the book this is a great one to read, even if you don't like reading. This whole operation was pretty crazy and the book tells it from a lot of perspectives, including some stories of Somalians 




 My dad is a pilot for Alaska so him trying to hurt their business because he was late makes me mad 




 My dad is a pilot for Alaska so him trying to hurt their business because he was late makes me mad 




 Two weeks ago you were asking me if you had to grow up 




 UP all night playing poker 




 I was thinkin Pikes Peak 




 They also serve free craft beer and wine 




 Taqueria Chaparrito in downtown is the best mexican food 




 I made my username after Lord helix 




 Further proves people upvoting aren't people in the comment section 




 How bout all the cows that had to live and die to feed the aforementioned people 




 May need some Windex 




 If i had my phone in my right pocket and wallet in left pocket that sounds really uncomfortable. Is it better than  I'm picturing it? 




 Figure out how you study best. I came in Freshman year thinking it would be enough to look over the study guide a couple times and be solid. Did NOT work out. You'll score a lot higher if you know how to study well

Also study a little bit every day instead of cramming, if you do this you'll have all the time in the world to go out and have fun 




 The funniest slaps are when they're not anticipated IMO. After Slapsgiving they all? have an episode solely based around it 




 I think it's hard to say given that it was only season 1 and their plans for how the show would go were a bit different then. It is an interesting point though since he seemed pretty fixated on something that would not bode well for Ted and Victoria's relationship 




 There's that episode in S9 where they say you can have that one "you can't ask me why" request. But in Season 2 Marshal asks Lily a favor when she returns to NY but she can't ask why 




 Star Wars Battlefront. I've probably spent a couple hundred hours on Bespin Platforms alone 




 Whenever I chew gum it's as if I've completely forgotten how chewing works 




 I think most trending subreddits are from askreddit threads. It's always funny to see a post there and then the next day the subreddit its trending
 




 I'd say he's one of the very few people who actually pull off autotuning, I love 808s 




 I mostly agree with this. I'd also just say that any good music today isn't the catchy type of song that you would hear being sung in a bar 









 He didn't have a coke 




 My OChem professor used the chalkboard. OChem 2 used powerpoint and I hated it 




 Let's not forget John Belushi either. The Breakfast of Champions skit is hilarious and probably not even close to his funniest performance 




 I agree that they rushed their relationship a lot. they dated for like 5 episodes? It didn't really help that the next episode was The Playbook, where Barney actually uses their breakup to his advantage. I didn't really like this episode either though it was painful watching Barney and Robin being total jerks to each other 




 I'd say one reason is because a large portion of both guys and girls here work out consistantly 




 Ahhhh.... ohhhh.... 




 Holy fuck. The wing actually scraped the top of it. I can't imagine how loud and terrifying that must have been 




 Constantly rubbing my fingers together. I just can't stop for some reason 




 I thought it was to make them haters look back at themselves 




 Anyone know how big the sample is? This is awesome btw 




 I'm predicting 1 mil views by tomorrow and a special on some news channel 




 incandescent  




 Supposedly the soft serve ice cream at mcdonalds is the healthiest thing on the menu 




 Tim's Jalepeno chips are perfect 




 Wyoming. I think they ranch there?  




 I guess we're bday buds 




 The entirety of E. WA is 1.3 mil though so King Country alone has more than the whole other side of the state. This isn't an argument for money but more for voting and the fact that E vs. W has different needs 




 Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!" 




 I just hated her reason for wanting to save the Arcadian. She grew up in it? I get the sentimentality but the fact that the snake infested building could be replaced with something way better that affects everybody would've been much greater.

Yes I know the lion stone headwork is iconic!! 




 This and the time it takes to gather the courage to go ask. I used to sit the for 15 minutes debating whether to go talk to them or not. Now it's like 2 beers and a couple minutes 









 3 months ago was a good time for this repost 




 Fine I'll take on that role tonight 




 Cheap tricks?! Not one of these is a cheap trick.
Except for "The Cheap Trick.
" I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.
And even that one involves expensive hair extensions! 




 I laugh everytime at this. To me this is truly clever humor 




 You're right I had it on best 




 This is the top comment, though. 




 Black, purple, and teal were the official colors of the 90s. Just go look at the sweaters in thrift stores 




 4th grade powerpoints were allll about these. Of course putting a picture in the clear text was the best 




 That's what really confused me. They end up breaking up and instead of going to Barney who she claimed to have feelings for just goes back to Ted 




 I mean it's hard not to feel that way. We can only really take Ted's word that he loved the mother but we never really see it. I mean yes for a few episodes but not compared to the years we've seen of Robin 




 I used to always think Barney, but over the years I've changed my mind to Marshal. His speeches, singing, he's an actually good person but will still do stupid/funny things. He's an all around character 




 2 gen chem labs in a week *shudders* 

If you do decide to do that I'd advise not taking another class along with it that'd be too much 




 "Who the hell is that guy?"

"That's Shin-Ya, he's sortof been auditing the class" 




 How bout Modern Marvels? Also great. Or when they actually played Rome and WWII documentaries all the time 




 [X wing though](http://www.target.com/p/star-wars-men-s-sweatshirt/-/A-16505188?lnk=Rec|pdp|viewed_viewed|pdpv1)
 




 Not sure what the hate on Stephenson is about. I had lots of fun there. There's tons of people so you will find someone that has similar interests, it's no more than a 10 min walk anywhere, it's got tutoring in the building if you want that, and if you want to party you'll have no trouble finding one 




 I always thought that according to Marshal's he didn't wait nearly enough time to go out with Barney after Lily left him 




 I thought this episode was good too, the classic himym retelling of the same story. Also, there are just faaar worse ones than this all throughout season 9 




 Was the name of the dorm Stephenson..? 




 Beanie girl is looking longingly into his eyes 




 I almost forgot about the Balloon Robin thing. almost... 




 Not only that but any microbe on the babies skin the mom probably already has antibodies specific for it 




 Freshman year we actually managed to throw a decent party in someone's corner room (bigger than most dorms). All of a sudden an RA came in and there was alcohol everywhere. One dude there decided to go into the bathroom and punch the paper towel dispenser so hard he ended up busting up his hands and the police were called. Then this girl ended up puking on the floor of the corner room and the RA had her escorted to the hospital. It was basically chaos for a bit. I managed to walk out and despite them getting our student IDs down only the person who punched the dispenser got in trouble.  




 Mini putt. I've been playing it for like 10 years now never gets boring 




 That picture does not look to scale at all unless that fountain is going to be huge 




 I'd say the porn one was realistic in an edgy sorta way. The cliff one and bday one were a bit funny. Everything else made no sense 




 I've only really seen him in 30 rock and I love him in it. He does sound a bit crazy in real life but I can deal with it 




 Loan words? 




 I don't know what that is but sounds awesome 









 Probably because he sounds like a 14 year old 




 I couldn't even finish that. When she says "how can you sing about this with little kids listening to it. Don't you have kids?" Like Fuck it's up to the parents to not let their kids listen to that, he doesn't want little kids listening to his music it's not his audience
