 I'd actually think about keeping the processor and just going with a 780. No single card solution past  780 should bottleneck the 8320.  




 The last one should be wing dings. 




 Funny how this guy is trying to scam walmart. iPad mini ( non-retina edition) retails for 299.99. This guy has an iPad mini retina box, but iPad mini with the retina displays retail for 399.99. If you look at the front of the box, if the iPad mini has iOS 7 icons it is a retina version. If it has iOS 6 icons, it is the regular iPad mini. What a low down scum.
