 I don't even want to go near it. Every time I'm around the stuff I start to feel sick. It's sort of like the feeling you get when you know you've done something wrong. I can't explain it. 




 thank you. I'll keep you posted if I can keep my wits about me. 




 thank you Linkoban. Every comment like this brings me back to reality. If even an hour goes by now without hearing from someone, I start to lose my grip. I'm learning things that don't seem right and I need to get out of here now. Please don't go. 




 I can't say thank you enough. Each of you here makes me feel like maybe I can leave if I keep going. I replied to your thoughts above. If you have more suggestions, let me know. Please please don't leave. 




 I'm so glad you're here. I replied to your comment above. Thank you so much for the kind words. I really needed it, staying strong on my own is scary. Please stay.
