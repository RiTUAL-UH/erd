 Fuck him. You don't get to commit crimes and think an apology after the fact squares everything. 




 Her wrath will be fully unleashed on Reddit now. 




 What if he was big and black and could play football really well? That's a jackpot. 




 Joe Flacco elite as fuck. 




 Yeah, this seems like another case of Reddit upvoting a long post because they think long = good.

Not saying I could do better, or that OP did a shitty job.  It reads very well.  It's just the wrong character. 




 It's like he didn't even give a shit about dry hair. 









 Yahoo has him 2b eligible I think. 




 Sorry, Bender 




 If you were really smart, you would do both for that maximum IQ karma. 




 Texas, Our Texas! all hail the mighty State! 




 Seriously man.  I'm looking at my one month shit and have to physically fight the urge to shave this mangled mess. 




 I want to see what happens when the car breaks to a stop. 




 Specifically women and children! 




 What a scrub. 




 Didn't Modano also start out in a similar fashion with like 50 goals in his rookie year.  The he got Hitchcocked. 




 The differences between the two are astounding

/r/firstworldanarchists  




 Yup.  Throw in Dana's boner material Sheldon Adleson into that mix too. 




 He worked on conditioning!   Oh shit!  It's over, son. 




 If anyone is taking bets, I'll put money down on both of them on something. 




 Time to make that money. 




 I honestly didn't even notice.  I'm mentally vomiting now. 




 This is theft. A good manager would not let this shit fly. But then again, there are so few good managers in retail anymore. People are too afraid to offend idiots for fear of lawsuits or whatever. 




 Conservative estimate: there are at least 1 billion spiders in there. 




 yeah, Dana wishes he looked like that 




 Killing off Mr. Ecko was the last straw for me. 




 So why did they vanish. I'm not gonna watch, so dont worry about spoilers. 




 I stopped watching after the first episode. So they brought in another guy? 




 Yep. They do this to give their face false definition of a jawline as well.

Dammit, forgot how to properly cross post.  This is where the discussion is happening. 









 Seriously, this seems really dickish. 




  I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic. 




 Damn. That list of 1 time main event fighters is a who's who of former title contenders who disappeared into obscurity. 




 Are there lots of fighters like this?  The ones that seem to think that simply being in the game longer means that they are better than the newcomers by some huge margin? 




 post these in an imgur album and cross post to larger subs like /r/pics  




 i guess it only sucks for mobile users 




 Fuck iminus in the ass

 Don't worry, I upvoted your effort. 




 This is gonna be tomorrow's top /r/TIL post 



















 Only if there is a just god 




 Ah yes, the old "going limp" strategy. 




 That right there is the biggest problem.  Too many people being 'triggered' by actual discussion of real issues that need to be fucking discussed. 
























 Besides /r/news, what sub can this be posted to? 




 Cronyism on reddit.  What a riot.  After all the years of users being butthurt about GW's administration engaging in such actions. 









 ha 




 wrong song bruh 









 Thank you for yur brave honesty.  It couldn't have been easy. 




 all any of us want to see, really 




 I was under the impression that any sub that has 'porn' in the sub name is not actually pornographic. 




 Who do we blame for shitty removals? 




 It's ok, he has a black friend 




 Every decent dynasty league will have him on someone's roster.  Unless your league is shallow.

Hell, in one of my leagues, if a veteran is on the last year of a contract, his secondary receivers get picked up. 




 Holy shit, this would suck major donkey balls.  I've been to Skaagway, Alaska a few times, and I thought that was a tiny hell hole.  Literally one main street that goes for three or four blocks.  A few blocks for residents, and one block for shops that cater to the cruise ships.

Town population with all the seasonal employees during may, june, july, and august is around 800.  That drops to half that in the offseason.  Which always makes me wonder:  what do the people who stay during the winter actually do, since tourism is the economic driving force? 




 /r/shitpost

 Hahahaha. I was just kidding bro! Jeez, it was just a prank, lol haha. Can't you take a joke, haha lol? You need to lighten up bro. 




 Too bad Ronda's soul weighs 135 




 That's assault and battery. Oh yeah, not to mention the theft. 




 It's been true for a while now.  I haven't worked in a retail store for about 15 years, but I used to work at Kohl's, Target, and Academy Sports.  At all three locations we were trained for this as an "unexpected occurrence."  But when three different companies trained their employees to handle the same situation, it is hardly unexpected anymore. 




 Obviously it's going to get deleted from here, too.  Keep reposting, people.

 Holy shit, someone used they're and their in the same sentence correctly. 




 At this point in the retail game, it's expected. 




 Here I thought he was referring to some kind of extremely small bra size or something.

 It seems that I fucked up the joke.

 *[REACHING AROUND INTENSIFIES]* 




 could you share your next parlay? 




 As far as the draft stuff goes, in my best league, we keep track if all extra stuff in a Google docs that everyone can access, but only the commish can alter. Off season trades, draft pick trades, farm teams (for baseball), and other stuff. 




 Just be flexible, but dont allow yourself to be walked over. I had a baseball commish that was hell bent on having a defensive stat, so he started the league with an 'errors' category. After years of complaining from the other 11 owners, hr unilaterally changed it to another defensive category. The other owners wanted to eliminate the category, but he wouldn't even consider having a vote. Six owners ended up leaving the league after almost a decade in.

On the other extreme, I had a commish who would just implement whatever rules were suggested by two particular owners. We ended up with ppr, points per rushing attempt, points per passes completed, extra points for yac yards, and 8 defensive starting positions.

Both if these types of commissioners suck the enjoyment out of the game
 




 Find that scene and post it r/videos 




 This right here is the best answer.  Your safety should be your family's priority.  If they are more concerned with community image than your safety, then fuck them. 




 I remember people calling for Aldo/Pettis when Showtime first won the belt.  Incredibly disrespectful to Aldo, who has had the strap for years.  Let a champion at least fucking dominate their own division before calling for superfights.  Even then, don't do it. 




 This was way more dominant.  Barao lasted into the 4th, and at least fought back.

 If this was really wall street, no they wouldn't 




 Not even that 




 LOL at the HBO shills giving it to Bradley

 Plus, didn't those dutch training camps use to go full retard during practice at Golden Glory? Or whatever that camp was called? The same one that ruined Manhuef's chin I think. 




 Why are people holding 60fps as some hot shit?  When I play CSS, I routinely get 200fps+.  Is that something different? 


Edit:  Thanks for all the clarification guys 




 Total noob question: how do I create an ai only match? 




 He's flipping off op because this isn't a confession 




 Does anyone have that picture of these guys coming out of a high end shop with full bags with some distorted version of "Master of Puppets" lyrics? 




 typo.  I meant to say 985 miles per hour. 




 Typical OP.  Not posting an easy link to porn for us.  For shame. 




 Seriously.  That's fucking Randy Johnson.  That ball must have been going at least 885 miles per hour.  Conservative estimate. 




 shuck it Trebek! 




 Oh Long Johnson! 




 I seriously don't remember the faux intellectual bit.  So I looked his ass up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn)

Foghorn Leghorn[3] is depicted as a large, white adult Leghorn rooster with a stereotypically Southern accent, a "good ol' boy" speaking style, and a penchant for mischief

I read through the entire bio.  Nothing about being an idiot. 




 I don't remember Leghorn using the absolute wrong words. 




 Error:  bug has re-emerged, this time stronger 




 You have no idea what he's talking about because he's trying to use big words and getting them wrong.  Apprehending =/= comprehending. 




 Also, you used the word "apprehending."  That makes absolutely no sense.  Did you mean "comprehending?" 




 Deb's angry swear word rants became the saving grace of that show's last four seasons. 




 DUN-DUN 




 OMG guise this is so insane!  So not only is this poor wolf neutered, but now has a vagina? 




 I created www.reddit.com/r/TILunfiltered/ but I know nothing of how modding and managing a sub works.  If anyone has any interest, you can take over and build it up.

I'm just sick and tired of legit TIL posts getting knocked off the front page. 









 Can someone start a clone sub of TIL called /r/didyouknow or something like that with less bullshit? 




 Seriously.  The only way it could be more ironic is if he was injured from an opponent who held on too long. 




 just a little bit 




 MMA training camps 




 No worries.  I set aside a small budget for entertainment, and my sports betting falls under that category, so I don't over spend.  If I lose a big bet or series of bets, that's just my entertainment budget finished, and nothing more.

Since it's my first time trying live betting in MMA, I'm gonna go small, with $10 bets.   




 Interesting theory.  I've never done live betting, but I'll try it tomorrow night during the UFC event and see what happens. 









 WHAT DID HE SAY?!?!?! 




 Everything T-Mobile has been doing makes me want to join their network.  Except for the fact that their network sucks outside of big cities.  FUCK!

 Totally serious 




 I would honestly be shocked if Weidman was clean.  Not taking anything away from his accomplishments; I just highly doubt people coming from wrestling backgrounds who cut shit tons of weight. 




 This is a good thing.  Hopefully all the shit that's been clogging Reddit's arteries will flow over to tumblr.  They can be number 1 all they want with their shitposts and trigger warnings 




 Also, this isn't a fucking confession 




 dummy, he said un-ionized.  Can you tell who doesn't have their PhD guys? 




 What happens when you've got Red Bull? 




 Having an opinion is not a fucking confession. 




 Kind of over rated, OP.  I expected better.  You can totally tell that you didn't even put your heart into the brush strokes. 




 much like /r/funny, this sub has become a breeding ground for /r/shitpost 




 almost KenM levels, but not quite. 




 High price =  high quality, right? 




 Link, bruh 




 This is why you people(ex-Muslims) are few in numbers

The reason why we are so few in number is because those of us not public with our apostasy fear for our lives from bible thumping (quran thumping) muslims who genuinely believe we should die for our own personal choice.

Funny how there was no choice given to most of us when we were assigned the religion at birth.  




 I come from an Indian background, but I've seen this mentality prevalent in almost all religious families around the world, where they are so concerned with what people think of them from the outside, that they don't care to fix their families from the inside. 




 I haven't been doing it consistently.  But 20 years ago, I started leading and I had no choice, since I was a minor.  As I grew older, and my balls got bigger, I started refusing.  First passive aggressively by taking night classes in college that directly conflicted with taraweeh schedules.  Then, as I got a job later on, I would just tell people I didn't feel like it.  If people really pressured me into it, and it would seem like there might be some blowback to  my parents in terms of ostracizing, then I'll begrudgingly do it.

But I've garnered a reputation as kind of a smart ass that talks back and correct everybody's bullshit pseudo science opinions on Quranic miracles, so now they only come to me when they're desperate. 




 Of course it has awesome food.  Every big city in America is gonna attract international cuisine.  The thing is, does DC have anything that is strictly DC?  Or does it kind of fall into Baltimore as far as food influence goes? 




 To be fair though, I've heard that Geno's is way overrated any ways, and to get a real cheese steak, you have to go elsewhere, not so popular. 




 That's fucking purple. 




 I don't know.  Does /u/gallowboob shamelessly repost and pass things off as his own?  I never thought he was a reposter, just a mass poster. 




 There are fucking billboards about the rape problem.  Holy fucking shit. 




 Oh my god, that is almost as insanity wolf as OP's brilliant post. 




 Yeah but you can totally tell, right? 




 Although really, once is enough 




 Haha.  I've been leading taraweeh for almost 20 years.

 Seriously.  I thought it was generally agreed upon that the staredown with fighters and fans was incredibly douchey. 




 Or maybe the coal deletes some of their karma. 




 What about my 1991 egg shaped Toyota Previa? 




 Yeah, these "accidentally in the wrong thread" posts are so painfully obvious attempts at shitty karma.
