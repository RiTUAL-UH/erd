 That's a quote. I read it years ago but who said it alludes me. 









 It's a great university and its definitely worth your time if you can get in. Good luck. 




 I know this is late but I'd say before they turn 10. Just take them down and both parents talk to them just explain to them. They will likely understand but it depends on the situation.

If the kids birth parents died then that should be explained to them and say that you love them very much and then co.fort them for a while. When they grow up they'd be grateful that you raised them.

If, however, the kids parents abandoned them explain why they did it if it's known. Like they were very poor and couldn't raise you. If it was something like they never wanted kids then you could tell a white lie.

 




 1) ok if it doesn't bother you fine

2) this ha  become a reason in many recent divorces. I'm not saying they're all down to porn but you start expecting a new women every time which makes sex with the same woman boring and repetitive.

3). Ok that's fine

4). Learn how to use grammar and then we'll talk.

5). Thank you

6). Ok that's fine with me I respect your opinion I just don't like the idea of watching others have sex right even if it's considered the norm and also prostitution is wrong in my eyes but if your ok with it I won't judge. 




 You can't. It only works once it might look like your pressing it but  it's someone else 




 Porn doesn't show real sex. It shows a guy and a girl fucking for money. Not pleasure or love. 

It teaches people to expect someone different people every time.

It makes any women that don't have pornstar bodies look "disgusting"

It makes you think all women like hard-core sex like anal or gangbangs. While some might most don't.

It has almost no benefits but plenty of issues. 

Not to mention that it's basically just filmed prostitution. 




 Is that were south park creators got the idea of a gay fish? 




 It's a sort of social experiment. Everyone only gets one push and we aren't to let it reach zero. If we wait till it was at one then pushed it once back to sixty it could last over a year but people have pressed it so much it to be done in a month. 




 Depending on how things go in May we could have one in five years. A lot of people who said no have now said they wished they had said yes. If we don't get it within the next decade there's no telling how long it could be if ever. 




 I like, like you. I'm weird. 




 Ha, ha Obama's my home-dog. No but in all seriousness I hate having to be part of the UK 




 I like you. 




 But you don't know that it's easier, I'm not circumcised and I find it very easy to clean it takes literally less than a minute. 




 The university is amazing. It's a bit expensive but it's defined Italy worth it and st Andrews is a great place. 




 Sounds pretty good, how many seasons are there? 




 Sounds interesting I might watch it and see what I think :) 




 What's it about? I don't think I've heard of it. 




 Let's talk about why we love our favourite shows and try and get other to watch them too. 

Who are your favourite characters?

Why do you like them so much?

What is the main story about? 

 




 I don't see the point in the button can someone explain it please? 




 Ha, ha he's an ass. 




 Ha, ha oh sorry :D 




 That's sad. It really is a reminder of how there are people who suffer from war that have nothing to do with it. 




 And America should recognise the mistakes they made in WWII. I do know that Japan did some awful, awful stuff during the war (I'm not Japanese) Some of it was, indescribably disgusting but that was almost a century ago. We shouldn't let the past go but we should remember, learn an  move on to our futures with a little more insight. 




 What was your favourite serious? Mines was the original one, with ti and Matt etc 




 I love the clarinet, it has a great sound. If you know how to play it still you shouldn't let it slip away. Buy one and just play when you have time then you won't lose your talent. 




 I want a woman who is funny, kind and caring. She wants kids and is also pretty social. I hope she gets along with my family. As far as looks go it's not a huge deal but I like long brown hair, Brown eyes. Race and skin colour etc isn't an issue. I'd like her to keep herself clean. I mean most people do but when people don't wash it's just disgusting. Weight I prefer skinny but I don't mean like girls on tv skinny that's just wrong I mean a normal real life weight that's healthy not an eating disorder. 




 You should come to Scotland I've seen women like that. 




 I used to love Digimon, I actually researched the entire series last year :) 




 My friend, let's call him Bob, stayed one time. He always said he had night terrors. I always thought he was joking since he's pretty funny and always laughed when he spoke about it. Anyway he stayed and after he fell asleep he woke up but his eyes were shut and he was crawling around my room screaming then he tried to crawl downstairs. I didn't want him to get hurt but I also didn't want to wake him because it can be dangerous so I tried guiding him back to my room before he just kind of collapsed back in to sleep. It was only about two years ago.  




 Ok here's what to do:

1. Set aside time, a lot of time over the next two weeks

2. Get past papers, either from school or online

3. Make a time table to follow.

4. Start by trying a past paper. Study for a while (a few days) but make sure when your studying you take regular breaks and don't get to worked up. Then after studying try the past paper again and see what score you got compared to the first time. Let's you know if/that you are improving and where you need to work one. 




 I love their songs. I don't really hear of them here but I found out about them through the theme song for the big bang theory about eight years ago an  I've loved them since. 




 I like saying random stuff which just confuses people before they laugh because what I said was so random or over the top that they can't hold it in but I'm not a hilariously funny person, however, I do get quite a few laughs. 




 Ha, ha /u/SketchyJJ berta lovejoy is hilarious! 




 I personally play the piano, keyboard and drums. I enjoy playing lots of songs on each but here is my list:

Piano - I enjoy playing the caprices of paganini.

Keyboard - a whole new world from Aladdin.

Drums - mostly rock songs from the 80's but I don't have a favourite.  




 Ha, ha by mentioning it, like everyone else has, we can expect it in half a century. 









 Boom. They were dead  




 Gets remastered. Then... 




 I've heard it happy but I like the sad version. I like the bagpipes but even as a Scotsman I don't hear them too often, normally only on special occasions.  




 Hey so jefe, Scottish guy here. The bagpipes are Scottish you were right and some of us did want to be independent. He'll I hate having the English anywhere near me. There were videos of our votes being rigged and still they wouldn't do a recount. I fucking hate those bastards, please do some reading before assuming we just turned it down because every person I know wants independence! 




 Ha, ha I just saw this and felt drawn to it since I'm scottish. Yeah amazing Grace sounds beautiful in a sad way. 




 Book: 

Harry potter and the chamber of secrets when Harry and the others are in the wrong place at the wrong time

Gone (my favourite book series):

In book 5 when Diana gives birth to gaia and she becomes a killing machine so fast.

Hunger Games catching fire when katniss fails to show her love to peeta to snow. I prefer the book series to the movie but the movies were pretty good.



Movie: Finding Nemo 

When marlin drops the mask.

Game: Telltales the walking dead. ***SPOILERS***

When, in season 1, Lee gets bit. I have played a lot of games, I mean a lot and these are the only two that have made me cry.

Also in season two when Rebecca dies and she tries to eat her baby and then the Russian gang attack and we don't know untill episode five who lived and who died!!

Tv series: Buffy the vampire slayer season 1 finale

When Buffy died for like two minutes and then she had an amazing sequence where she was walking with a smile on her face to the theme song before killing the master.

The walking dead show: ***SPOILERS***

Basically every episode but to be specific season 3 episode 4: killer within. Lorri goes into Labour right when a bunch of walkers try and attack the group and then she later dies :) 




 Don't worry about it I'm 16 and I've never drank alcohol. I've never been high either but that's cause, not to judge you but, I'm against drugs. Of course alcohol is a drug of sorts but back to your question. Anyway if you really want to try being drunk don't get pressured into it and don't hide it from your mum and dad. In December my family had a kind of party, my mum has lots of brothers and sisters so there were a ton of us. She said to me:

"(Insert my name here) if you want to have a couple of beers tonight don't get embarrassed or ask anyone else to buy you one. Come to me and I'll get you them". 

I never did it but I liked that I was aloud. She said to me soon after if I want to drink I can have some friends over, not  a party or anything (I really don't enjoy parties so that's fine) but just you and your friends (she said their names but I have around 4 close friends here outside my twin. I have others but they're the ones I always talk to.

I went off subject there, sorry, anyway my point was if you want to drink try not to worry about it to much. I suggest you say to your parents or whoever you live with, let's pretends it's your mum:

Hi mum, is it ok if (just say a couple, three at most, of people's names) come over tonight and have a couple of beers?,

She might say no at first but just explain to her that it's better if you have a drink at home where she knows what's going on rather than walking around the streets drunk, that should make her come around.

I've worried to that if I drink I'll say something I regret but I guess I'll try it when I'm ready but since you are ready, good luck.

Also I know I said  it but don't be pressured into it. 




 Wow! That was beautiful. I never expected anything like that. I really have to applaud you. The ending was sad but with a re-read there were hints and the fact that it seemed so *real* is a great bonus. If I never  knew that you had just written that you could put it in a history book and throw a name or two on it and I'd certainly believe it was from the time. 




 Ha, ha I love south park!! :D 




 He was hired 




 Good luck man, I'm doing this for myself, my future and religion. Everyone here's pretty supportive good luck. 




 Because they felt 




 A smaller bear

 Wrecked. 

I watched wreck it Ralph. 




 Ha, ha thank you? I guess. I love writing but every now and then I enjoy doing little joke stories like this and I couldn't help myself but I do like the idea of Ronald and the burger king. 




 Just incase you misunderstood I'm setting this during the Irish potatoe famine. 




 Ha, ha sorry about that. What do you think was wrong with my version? Was it all the farting, oh or the ending? 




 There once was a land that housed a man,

The man was a king, a burger king.

This man was loved by all,

Which would lead to his eventual downfall...


Our tale begins in the land of resturantante in the year of 1397AD. The land was happy and the king was beloved by all. One day King Burgerton the sixth was at chess with his beautiful wife sal-ad when his young, promising jester Ronald of house McDonald strolled through the door with a grin on his face and a twinkle in his eyes.

"Ah, young Ronald" said the king

"My Lord" he replied with a slight hint of laughter in his voice "m'lady" 

"Might I ask what's so funny young Ronald?" Ask the king

"Why yes, you may" then out of nowhere young Ronald leaped from where he stood and farted on lady sa-lads face, a little bit of crap came out too.

Ronald held his side with laughter

"Aaaaaugh, aaaaaauuuuuuuuugggggghh!!!" Screamed the queen

"Ronald!! My queen are you ok?" asked the king

"I shall never be clean again!!" She stood from her seat and ran to the window before jumping to her death.

Soon after the king became a ruthless and unjust man. He banned all cola and wouldn't allow any extra sauce!! He tried to kill young Ronald himself but the lad escaped.

Ronald went on to form his own kingdom of monopolyow. Through time it grew, they struggled at first attacks from dragons were a regular occurrence but before Ronalds 300th birthday his kingdom was striving. King budgeting heard of this kingdom and he wondered how a young, immature jester had accomplished such a feat. Straight away he declared war against the kingdom. 

The war was long and unforgiving. Winters dragged on and summers seemed to span a lifetime. Yet the war continued. Eventually young Ronald came up with a cunning plan. He had a wicked sorceress temporarily disguise him as the king from the distant land of pizzerianton, Lord hut. He arrived and king burgerton greeted him happily before Ronald, still disguised farted on his face and chopped of his head.



The end. 




 Ha, ha I'm sorry ;) (but seriously I'm sorry) 




 Ha, ha don't worry when I said it was rare I meant very rare like very, very rare. Don't worry you won't be using your mouth as a butt anytime soon :) 




 Yes, it's very rare. When you swallow food it goes through the process of peristalsis which is basically (the very short version) going in one side and comming out the other. This rare disorder waits till your food reaches the end of the process and basically turns around fixing EVERYTHING back up. It will likely never happen to you but if it does it will only happen once.  




 Ha, ha I was going to say this has been posted a million times. My username is XboxG4mer because I love xbox!! :) 




 And reverse peristalsis is just shitting from your mouth :) 




 Nice :)  




 Great question! I would make it... a diamond, I think since they are very difficult to break and I would likely hide it in a desert or a Forrest. I would kill my father (I'd rather not say why). 














 I love flying. It's great to look out of the window and see the ground hundreds of feet beneath you.  I lov  taking off, landing and everything about it. You don't get any special feeling but I reccomend you try it one day. 




 Sorry but what is this. 




 It would vary. Before nofap at some points I would do it a few times a day or just once  or twice a week. 




 I'm not in anyway saying that she represents the entire culture but they are very heavily oppressed but know no other way of life so simply accept it. 




 That was an interesting read, I'm not from the US so I never knew that they never taught that over there.  




 Ha, ha you're happy because you can be but you're unhappy because you shouldn't be able to be :D 




 I have spoken with a north Korean woman, she said they have almost no freedom and that's the way they were brought up so they don't understand the concept of freedom, therefore they can't value it. They are taught that the authorities are in charge, what they say goes. No one would dare speak out against it or rebel in anyway because they have no way of doing so and no one would ever speak of such things.  




 I understand that completely. I love having my views challenged, cause like you said it strengthens them or opens you up to new ideas. Again, like you, I love science. Especially biology and chemistry but for whatever reason people don't always like science and religion being paired but I've  never had any trouble in that department, well at least not anything serious.  




 What do you mean the freedom is going away? I'm from Scotland and I understand why you would care about freedom since its something virtually everyone values, at least those that have it do. I can't imagine people in north Korea valuing their "freedom" very much. 




 Good luck man that's rough but at least you're not going to binge or mope over it. Failure doesn't have to be bad as long as we learn from it. 









 [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/313q43/for_a_very_very_short_period_of_time_each_and/) 




 Repost! I wrote this yesterday!! :( 




 Not really, that's when we were conceived not born and we track the days from birth. I guess you're right in a sense. 









 Yeah we all know this is a repost. 









 No, I feel like it would drive me mad trying to prevent it or worrying about how close it is or isn't. I'd rather just leave it the way it is. 




 Ha, ha oh my god I have to make another variation of this and stick it in every bathroom I know of! 




 April fools! 




 So those who help keep reddit going can't use it? 









 So, Cinderella, do you deny the charges of murder of Sir Prince Charming in the 1st degree set against you here today' asked Far, far aways Totalitarian ruler the queen of hearts, who was foreseeing the case... 




 I know it's April fools and all but I wouldn't wear that even if  you paid me!! :D 




 'So, Cinderella, do you deny the charges of murder of Sir Prince Charming in the 1st degree set against you here today' asked Far, far aways Totalitarian ruler the queen of hearts, who was foreseeing the case... 




 Wow! I never thought about that before. 




 Damn!! 




 Damn it! The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan! 




 Oh my god you actually did this!! Yay!! What do you think the general reaction will be to your new movie, especially after the success of the original? 




 Ok here goes:

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a boy. A boy just like any other, except for one small difference. He was an egg. His name was humpty. Humpty lived with his mother and father, both loved their son very much, however, his parents were human. This made humpty feel very self conscious and confused since he was the only egg in the neighbourhood that people wouldn't eat, of course this was a positive in his books. He didn't want to be boiled, mashed or scrambled.

One day humpty came home from school and when he walked into his house he saw something that made his eyes yolk. His mother, snow white, was lying on the floor with blood oozing, slowly, from the back of her head. Behind her stood Doc, an enraged, heroine addicted dwarf. He stared straight at humpty, there could be no witnesses! Doc threw himself towards humpty who narrowly dodged doc and his incoming hammer, the same hammer that had just beaten his mother.

Humpty ran from his home and into the deep dark forrest. Doc was still following him, he threw the hammer straight into humpty's back. Yolk began pouring from humpty's bumhole.

 ***6 months later*** 

'Do you Doc, dwarf of house white, understand the accusations put forth against you by Prince, Wilfred charmingDumpty the third and his son Humpty Dumpty?' Asked the queen of hearts who was judging the murder trial which had unfolded after snow whites death.

'I do and I deny each and everyone of them. I would never murder snow white! She was my friend, and sometimes more if you know what I mean' he winked this last sentence which enraged Prince charming who soon tried to attack his wife's killer

'Order! Order I say!!' Yelled the queen. After things settled down the queen continued.

'Doc, can you explain the giant crack on this poor eggs anus?' She asked while she held back a laugh.

'I, eh... are you serious?' He replied

'Yes, quite serious'

'I don't anything about said crack'

'Doc, by denying the charges put forth against you, you are proving not only that you are terrible at lying but that you...' doc sniggered

'Excuse me' said the queen 'might I ask what you find so funny?'

'Yes, ha, ha' he said grabbing his sides 'you said but, ha, ha!!'

'Fuck this' she said agitated 'doc, you have pissed me offer you silly little junky, we have indisputable proof that you murdered snow white, by denying it you have angered me. Off with his head!!'

'Shit' said Doc as he was carried away.

Humpty and Prince charming walked out of the court house victorious.

'How do you feel knowing justice has been served?' Asked Cinderella of Fairy news 5

'I feel supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious' said both of them at the same time.





Sorry I never included more characters but that was fun.

 









 True but his name is Harvey dent 




 Lara's doppelganger from tomb raider underworld. She was made to be a villain and had no power over what she did, she was eventually freed by Lara though and managed to kill natla so she kind of redeemed herself. 




 I can't drive either, take a bus or train. I'm from Scotland and the buses and trains are a pretty good quality but I hear that's pretty bad in the US. 

To be honest I'm not a love expert, I'm kind of a nerdy guy but just ask her. I know it's easier said than done but force yourself to do it. 




 Great! Please, whatever you do ask her in person. Don't do it through text, it makes you look scared. 




 Just try hanging out with her first. 









 Ok, see I was worried that if she said no then her friends would find out and I'd be made fun of. Just do it. I wanted to for so long, it took me months but one day I woke up and said:

"Today's the day! I'm going to do it"

Just force yourself but no matter what don't do it in front of people and don't put pressure on her. If you do it in front of people she could get embarassed and say no.

Just say:

Hey [insert name of girl here] Do you want to hang out later? 

Or even just ask her to the movies. 

When you two are alone ask her. If she says yes don't brag about it, be happy obviously but don't ruin it by telling everyone straight away, wait till you're both ready. If she says no just ask her not to tell anyone.  




 I'd say don't force it. My old girlfriend and I were friends for years and one day I noticed how much I actually liked her. I was to shy to ask her out but eventually I made myself and she said yes. Ha, ha I remember after she went home I jumped around for ages screaming

 "yeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss" 

Anyway don't go out with a girl just to have a girlfriend, make sure you like her in that sense. 




 Computer programming?! Great! It's a growing industry, there are only going to be more and more jobs in that department. Follow it, if you think you can do it. Make sure you do enjoy it though, you don't want to be miserable doing something you hate. 




 In school what is your favourite class, what do you look forward to. 




 Well I don't have a gf right now because I moved a while back so me and my, at the time girlfriend had to split up. 

To stop playing games I found something that would motivate me. History. I want to be a history teacher and I would rather have a nice future than a lifetime of games. 

Just find that thing that motivates you to stop.  




 Ha, ha the day after I could barely keep my eyes open :D I do want to go places in life though and playing games won't get me there, studying will, so even though it was hard I'm happy to do this but during the summer holidays I'm going to play again :)  




 I would occasionally (during holidays or weekends) do 24 hour game sessions with friends. Now I'm happy with just a few hours because I know it's better in the long run. 




 Now I'll play for maybe an hour or two on Saturdays and Sundays but I used to play for a minimum of six per day. 




 I still play my xboxes but only for short periods of time, not like my old hours a day. 




 Oh, I hate CoD. 




 I'm doing 5 subjects next year and they're what I'm going to study. An hour and a half of each subject per day means around 7 and a half hours a day. With a break or two of course. 




 Oh me too I'm a much bigger DC fan than Marvel 




 I haven't quite finished it yet but when I submit it I'll come back here and tell you :) 




 Who? 




 I built agrabah from Aladdin. I made my INterior look like the palace and I even built the cave of wonders. Inside it is a big platforming challenge, at the end you can save genie and get some treasure. I built the marketplace and even Aladdins "home". Remember his place where he looks at the palace. 









 You have to want to. What do you want to be. I used to just lay around playing xbox, I always wanted to be a doctor but I stopped and asked myself what do I really want out of life? I decided that I wanted to be a history teacher since I love the subject and for other reasons. Any way now I study way more, I used to study for a while each night now I'm going to study for six hours a day for the next 3 weeks. Set a goal and work towards it.
