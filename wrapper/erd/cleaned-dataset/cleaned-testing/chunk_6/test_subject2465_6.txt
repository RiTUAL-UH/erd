 Did you really think the NSA wasn't doing that? 














 Because it was all a dog and pony show anyways. 

They knew there was no real scandal 




 Its well documented that Snowden et al aren't really being honest and clear with who has the documents and who has which documents and how many there are.

And they've been really cavalier with how they've managed all that data.  




 what details do you want? They said this came from the PM's cabinet

Its not clear snowden is being honest about who has what files.  




 Do you know what FIVE EYES is? 

Please tell me you're at least qualified to participate in this conversation 




 What world do you live in where stolen state secrets don't get people killed? 




 Greenwald doesn't know as much as he claims to know. Snowden had to teach him how to even use PGP...but now he's some sort of security expert. 

Come on now.  




 Theres no tanks rolling down the street, therefore the USA faces no threats.

See how stupid that sounds?  




 Its funny when you consider the EU spends effectively NOTHING on defense yet tries to wave their tax base around and proclaim how superior their civil society (read: government subsidy) is while the USA does all the heavy lifting.  




 Its funny that the Iranian news source is reporting this.  




 I think historically, they've shot more USA planes down than we've show down of theirs 




 Huh? How are they the idiots? 




 we have no way of knowing if these journalists are telling the truth either.

Do you not understand this?

AND GREENWALD ET ALL REVEALED EFFORTS ON INTERNATIONAL SPYING 





























 Prove that snowden used this type of encryption  




 its not pointless when you live in a country on top...now is it.

You really don't understand what a lesser nation sees that you don't, do you? 




 they claim that sourcing someone in the UK PM cabinet isn't good enough 




 What world do you live in where everything is peaceful and there are no threats and on-going fights for geopolitical leverage? 




 What world do you live in where theres no threats?  




 Wikileaks is moving the goalposts.

The files are cracked and the info is gone. Why won't they just stop the charade?

This has nothing to do with Snowden...the intel is out. They keep wanting to make it about him.  




 this article has nothing to do with spying on americans 




 They burned for an hour...and planes traveling cruising speed hit them 




 Unless a jetliner traveling 400mph hits it, this thread is stupid 




 I'm not blindly patriotic. I've criticized this government more than you'll ever known...but what I'm not is naive about how many other nations would leap at the chance to use our own information against us.  




  international spying on civilian communications is out of order. If the Russian government was caught sniffing all US citizens youporn browsing habits it's be a violation of US sovereignty.

Yeah. So? 

We promote the ideas we want and shun those we don't want.

Theres no such thing as hypocrisy on the world stage

 




 Now, you're just a naive blowhard 














  The way the NSA does encryption? Yeah, it's unbreakable.

You're talking like you think snowden did this very thing. 

 




 Please, tell us more about these security standards you use that all foreign governments can crack with no effort.  




  Snowden did not take any files with him to Russia. As a teacher of Chinese counterintelligence, he knows how to keep his data safe. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians stole his data, nor did they "break the encryption", this entire story is utter nonsense and transparently so to anybody with a modicum of crypto experience.

Thats a nice cover-up to avoid the fact that they really had no tight clamp on the data that they claimed to


So Greenwald says "my files are safe"...and it turns out they're not.

So where does this leave us?  




 Did the asparagus make Putin taste bitter this time?  




  I really don't get Reddit sometimes. Failures are known, successes are not. 

PRECISELY!!! Why the hell would they advertise a victory?!? 




 Because it was a TERRIBLE metaphor and you've overplayed your hand.  




 I don't advocate dometic wiretapping. 

I advocate international spying.  




 Portugal also has no geopolitical influence around the world.  




 You haven't shown the extent of your knowledge and frankly, it doesn't matter. You don't work for the NSA and its very telling that so many people claim to be security experts until snowden showed the world how many backdoors there were into all of these "secure" communications.

So yeah, keep flaunting your credentials like your'e the next Thomas Drake or William Binney. 

You're neither. You haven't worked on those frontlines patching up the shores of the US's infrastructure. You're probably some low-level employee at Yahoo...but i'm really not interested at learning what you claim to know cause you got a BSE somewhere.  




 So you're just against any sort of power, right? 

**Because i've already admitted domestic spying is a legitimate debate...foreign intelligence is NOT up for debate.**  




 Call me a hypocrite, but I don't have any problem with the CIA infiltrating the highest ranks of every other country and using that intel to improve the welfare of the United States.

You know why?

Because everyone else does it.

And why should we lose out on that leverage and legitimacy while everyone else does?

Do you want to turn us into...portugal?  




 No. We're not

You tried to pretend that Poland has border disputes, therefore Americans can't care about their borders.

its not my problem you don't have two bodies of water on both sides of you.  




  Red herring. He's said all countries spying is bad. Repeatedly.

Too bad. He's never revealed a single Russian intelligence effort. Or chinese. Or Japanese. Or African. Or south american.

I support my country using ANY asset to gain leverage over others.

Theres a reason I don't live in Mexico.  




 The principles of THIS COUNTRY do NOT extend to everyone outside of this country. 

Period

Stop pretending every human is an american citizen.  




 Its so insulting to see people not even be capable of weighing different sources of information at the same time

If snowden says it, its law. 

Its so weird to me 




 Do you know anything about the Chinese or Soviet or Pakistani  nuclear programs? 

You all are so naive at this point 




 NSA was fine when it does international spying

Domestic spying is one thing.  




 You're waving the "programmer" card?

I'm a med student. 

Does that disqualify me from talking about anything? Cause last I checked, you weren't exactly James Bond either.

So lets get focused again.

Why do you support Chinese spying? 




 Spying doesn't work that way.

The world isn't flat and its not fair.

 




 **He could have leaked just the domestic stuff, then.**


People do NOT understand this.
 




 Whats evil?

Because I don't consider spying on non-Americans evil.

I fully support it.

I'll wait until Snowden says the Chinese doing it is bad. Because he won't.  




 I bet you believe everything coming out of Putin's mouth though.  




 I have no problem discussing domestic intelligence.

The problem is that Snowden turned the gun on his own people...and for that, I have no empathy for whatever happens to him.  




 Because:

1. Snowden didn't have to reveal foreign intel. THAT is treasonous. 
2. There are mechanisms in place to do it
3. he chose to just go rambo and he went off the reservation. 




 You're talking a big game but won't acknowledge how Poland has basically come hat-in-hand asking the US to reinforce their low-land in case Putin decides to go for a drive across the border.  




 Snowden doesn't realize the Russians and Chinese don't care about him.  




 Yeah. You're playing the game where your fingers are in your ears.  




 Its not speculation. Read the article in the Sunday times.

A member of the UK PM cabinet said the Russians and Chinese intel leaders HAVE the files.  




 Whats funny to me is that for every prevented attack, you're probably in that predictable band-wagon calling it "entrapment" or "false flags" or something else that just can't wait to steal the credit of legitimate intelligence efforts. 

And mind you, I'm a heavy contributor to /r/conspiracy...but the world is more complicated than just thinking the opposite of everything you read is therefore the truth.

Its lazy. You're lazy.  




 Or...honest? 

You seem to think the world is just full of daises and theres no importance in geopolitical intelligence

 




 I fully support the NSA/CIA knowing if any Non-American so much as brushes their teeth for 20 seconds. 

Domestically, we can argue changes...but internationally? I want the CIA to have access to any resources they can imagine.  




 I didn't think there were chances RSA was cracked...until it was revealed.

Nothing phases me anymore.

Snowden got reckless and now the US is at risk. He can't claim to just be a passive participant in this anymore.  




 But you won't DARE touch what Snowden did to internationall efforts

Whats funny about all of these leakers is that they live with (and I say this as a non-white guy) something that looks like "Western white guilt" of sorts where they're only concerned with how bad the USA is...they'll NEVER say a WORD about Russian spies or Chinese spies in American higher education 




 Whistle-blowers use official channels. They don't just reveal anything they want then say "SURPRISE! IM A WHISTLE BLOWER!"...especially when you're a government agent with top secret clearance. 

He crossed the line when he didn't stick to domestic intel.  




 I don't feel the need to EVER let up on the gas. 

This is the Great Game. 

Catch up. 




 Wow. Sounds like YOU know what snowden had.

Tell us more. What'd he eat for dinner?  




  No, it isn't clear. In fact, it's buried in so many strata of lies and bullshit, that I'm surprised anyone alive still trusts our government to tell us the truth.

Why are you so goddamn dense?

Yes. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO GET AT US!

Do you not acknowledge this? 


The world isn't peaches and cream and candy.

Its rough and everyone is fighting for ANY leverage possible. Stop thinking this world is safe and everyone is a good actor.  




 Flying-Bagel-Monster, forbid I have my own nuanced opinions as a 1st generation american about how geopolitics works as a citizen and what it takes to maintain the edge internationally.

Go apply for your passport, use it, and get back to me.  




 I don't agree because you're not offering any immediate practical solutions instead of holding out for ambiguous, non-specific pie in the sky bullshit. 

This sounds like a great fiction story...but this doesn't help us RIGHT NOW.

So no, keep that "border-less world" crap to yourself. Its not even relevant...and its insulting you could be that naive to even try to use that as a talking point.  




 Just show me something other than the anonymous word of a few British spooks. That's about as unreliable a source can get.


2 hours ago you didn't even know this information...and now you're asking for more

Oh really? What do you want? ANOTHER leaker? 

Stop moving the goalposts.

This is the closest you'll ever get to this confirmation. Snowden burned everyone living in the west over an ideological hang-up he has about the reality of geopolitics.  




 Snowden just betrayed every American citizen because he didn't know where to drawn the line.

He took that risk and now, he's failed.  




  Did you know that the 4th amendment constitutional protection against mass surveillance afforded to Americans... is not unique to Americans?

Thats too bad. Because I'm not really concerned how non-Americans think about intelligence. 

All human beings are entitled to this right, and to protection from the law against anyone who might violate it. And yes, they are worrying about it, all those human beings who don't live in the US.


Like hell they are. 

Each country has their own interests. All of these hifalutin poetic ramblings offer no important tangible things to discuss. Practically, this is useless. I want the USA to maintain EVERY edge necessary to stay ahead of the pack in reconnaissance and leverage economically and geopolitically...and even militarily. 

There are borders for a reason and until you understand this, you'll never learn what allegiance means.  




 The hegemony works in our favor. Not theirs. 

Remember who makes the rules.  




 I post good links. You should try.  




 I don't work for the government...but I damn well understand that geopolitics extends beyond the end of the couch in many of the basements that the narrow-sighted AnCaps  ideologues that predominate Reddit. 

 




 its in the Sunday Times 




 ***Reminder to Reddit:***

When you inevitably read something like: no evidence from the leaks of anyone being harmed 

DO NOT BELIEVE IT. They would NEVER admit to there being a direct link. 

Any intel that gets leaked, gets people killed. 

Period. 
 




  which is irrelevant to the question "should we be doing this?" and also the question "is this the right thing to do?"

I don't care if its the right thing to do or how messed up you think it is.

I WANT my government to know whats going on around the world. Domestically, we can start talking about "rights" but I don't value or even think about the rights of non-domestic citizens because they should worry about their own issues.  

 




 I don't care about foreign governments.

Do you not understand this?

They don't care about you. if you live in the US or Europe these people DO NOT value your "rights" or privacy. They never did.

Domestic spying is one thing...foreign intel leverage is another.

Snowden crossed the line when he did that. 

I support the west and western ideals.  




 Yes. Because only the US has geopolitical aims and only the USA ever does anything bad.

When you deal with classified information and governments NOTORIOUS for stealing intel, then for some reason its hard for you to believe that they'd take stolen top-secret information

You're ridiculous.

Seems you don't understand how geopolitics works.  




 Thats the same as giving them the files.

Do you not understand this? 




 Two different conversations.

And frankly, a lot of Reddit doesn't understand how geopolitics works or how power is maintained, gained, or transferred.

its not neat and its not pretty.  




 ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS REVEAL DOMESTIC SPYING.

BUT NOOOOO...HE WANTED TO GO OFF THE GODDAMN RESERVATION.

THIS. IS. TREASON.  




 I do NOT care about surveilling foreign governments or interests.

Snowden crossed the line revealing foreign surveillance.  




 There was no breach until he leaked every bit of foreign intel effort  




 He's too famous to outright kill. 




 Being "anti-government" doesn't mean you're inherently right about something. I know you're looking for easy upvotes won't come that easily. Try harder. 

Why should I believe Snowden didn't give the chinese or rusians anything? 

All of his leaks were anti-american.  




 He won't say anything. They have his stuff.  




 i'd be SUPER pissed if he did that to me 




 Wont be for another decade 
























 well put 




 they're up 2 MILLION downloads from last month

Good god Rogan 




 This is hilarious 









 Eh.

 He's not entirely wrong... 




 just got renewed for season 3 http://t.co/KuDhPE95Jx 




 Yep. And it sends the message to the populace that "something is being done" about the situation when they're all in on it.

Look at how Germany responded to the Snowden leaks. They gave enough of a show to make it seem like they cared but they really didn't.  




 Why is it so foreign to you to consider that a group of religious people CAN in theory impose restrictions on their own behavior and societal organization?

A democracy does not mean what you think it does.  




 *slow clap* 









 You. 

You get it. 









 What? 




 That assist is amazing 




 On land? or out at sea? 




 I don't even know why anyone would argue this anymore

I mean, whats the difference from a private party at someone's house and this event?

In what world do people live in where those with money, power, or both not collectively gallivant around each other? 




 anyone that believes in freedom should resist these tyrants

Huh? 




 You're a professional athlete...why is that unusual?  




 They will...gotta focus more on shoes though instead of apparel

 He's preachy and a bit of a blowhard 









  A fundamental aspect of a democracy is having the right to protest, the right to organize freely, the right to vote, a relatively free press...

False

Thats an AMERICAN democracy

You're biased and you don't even know it

 They could have banned /r/coontown though 




 Not necessarily.

But Iran definitely has bomb components. Ask A.Q. Khan 




 Because its Boston 




 I don't know...I can't imagine Israel not sharing SOME of that info with the US 














 Democracy TECHNICALLY could result in the saudi arabia that exists.

I don't know why people confuse democracy with liberalism 














  listen to the kids threatening to kill the officer

So, you're lying now, huh? 




 They weren't tresspassing

 This video just proves the cops point.  




 Eh...guy wasn't really complying. 

Are we going to ignore this guy fighting back? 




 i bet you have 50,000 unread emails 









 How's middle school? 




 No. Watch the video. All the girls were leaving and he was cursing at them and they told him not to get so angry and as they were walking away, he pointed her out and then you saw everything unfold 









 Can you explain shortly? 




 She was walking away when he snapped.  




 Thermite! 




 you're trying to rationalize the irrational

Just accept that what Robertson said makes sense if you are religious 














 Not really it seems. I mean, if you're really religious, theres nothing wrong with that line of thinking... 





























 It wasn't a private pool party.  




 This is unreal 




 Good thing your computer opens those links for you.  




 We can judge them when they overreact  




  If they were atheists... They wouldn't have that many children and could properly take care of the ones they have so that this never would have happened.

This is why people hate atheists. 

I understand your point, its not exactly even true to a degree to make such a blanket statement 




 They would literally remove all impetus I have for using third-party apps if they made it easier to input events into the calendar.

Apps like Fantastical do a MARVELOUS job with this and I don't see whats so complicated about going ahead and doing it in house. Is such a thing patented? 

If you're not sure what I mean, look here: https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone 




 This isn't hate speech. 




  They are just trying their best to keep the situation under control while officer hot head is going around acting berserk. 

It only takes one.

And he's the ranking officer 




  Because they are kids, they should be allowed to bite, kick, scream, insult, steal, trespass, murder, etc without any retaliation or self defense. Because they are just kids. They get a free pass on everything. Yep, nothing illogical about that.

Thats not what happened

Its not as if people don't listen after repeated warnings to step back, get on the ground, etc. Nope, she wasn't given multiple chances to respect authority at all. He just drove up and immediately started throwing her on the ground. She totally wasn't resisting arrest at all, no sir.


She was walking away when the cop went and grabbed her


 




 Theres exactly no chance less. Pedophilia is what it is. Religiosity just tends to have a different effect on the outcome 




 She didn't. Everyone excoriated her for that.
