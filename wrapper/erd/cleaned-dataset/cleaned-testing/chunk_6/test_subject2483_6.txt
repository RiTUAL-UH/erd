 Thanks :)  




 :'( 




 You are right, that is why I am not doing so. I fully agree that I am too inexperienced, and I do not plan to do so anytime soon. That is why I am asking here, to be able to find out how to find this information.  Nevertheless, thanks for your answer: short and to the point. 




 I don't expect venture capitalists. I'm talking about friends and family. The only reason I would want increased capital is to allow me more opportunities. Any other questions that may help you understand? 




 Could someone please explain why Indonesia's GDP is so cyclical (yearly)? Its GDP rises the first 3 quartets, before falling in the fourth. 

Is this because of commodity experts? However, its largest commodity, coal, is merely 10% and not cyclical. Palm oil, 7.3% of exports, is not either. 




 I guess I should have added a TLDR:

I invest. I want other people to give me money. Their capital will track my portfolio (eg. my value +10%, their money invested rises +10%). They become minority owners of my portfolio, owning 'shares' of my portfolio/vehicle. They can sell the 'shares' to me or other 'partners' and earn/lose the difference. They have voting rights to the investment decision using their 'shares'. They sign document agreeing to all of this AND that they understand they may lose all money.

Is this legal? Will I have problems? 




 Thanks for the fast response! Where would I be able to find the french laws? If that is asking too much, where did you find the US laws? 




 Hey r/Investing!
I hope this post matches the high quality that this amazing subreddit provides to all. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short.
I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds), living in France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the 'investment vehicle' to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this). 




 That is awesome! Would you mind showing me your website, kickstarter, or plan? Honestly, I would like to help you if I can, specifically in accounting (not that there is much point for it, but I would want to build balance sheets, PnLs and cash flow forecasts). 




 Thanks for the response! That is something I used to do in Poland (which got me in trouble but yolo ca$h money bling bling). Now that I live in Paris, and are in high school, we can leave the campus and all stores are available to us. :(

If you have other ideas, please tell me! 




 So how does this apply to 'les Pays Bas'?

Would you be nice enough to tell me a bit about the atmosphere in Spain right now? Where are you from, what job do you work in, what do people think about the parties? Economy? Euro/EU? I would love to hear a inside perspective that isn't from the news. If you do not want to, by all means don't. I'm just very curious! 




 I would love doing that, but its impossible living in the middle of Paris. I was thinking maybe bringing newspapers or even breakfast (croissant, etc.) to neighbors (and later grow) every morning. What do you think? 




  Excluding school, etc. I am not able to pay taxes, which puts me in a difficult position (by declaring taxes myself my family will lose a lot of its 'pro-natalist' benefits). Secondly, I did not localize a problem that I could solve living in Paris, which would allow me to open a business. Costs here are very high too, which would mean that I would need a large price to cover them. But please, if you have any ideas or guidance, I would love to here it. What do YOU do? Tell me your story! 




 I am investing through my father's account as I learn and ease myself into the world of investing, which limits my risk of losing too much money. Therefore, I do not have the privilege of exploring my broker's capabilities (however, this will certainly something I will now try to ahcieve). Nevertheless, could you please tell me a bit more about investing in bonds. Thanks  




 1) Governments of major economies, nothing too hard
2) From what I understood, purchasing bonds in the primary market requires high capital (thousands of euros), which I do not own being only 17. If I am wrong (as I often am), please enlighten me.

Thanks for the answer by the way, I appreciate it greatly. 




 Just don't vote for Podemos and you should be fine in the long term :) Hang on tight! 




 +1 for "depending on what part of France you're in, some have more grass then others"

Thanks for the guidance, being so young I guess it is what I need most. I have trouble finding resources to work out the myriad of taxes and regulations imposed here, and I am not sure what to do. If only there were entrepreneur subreddits for each country (or at least an EU wide one)...

I would love if I could help you with accounting. I would love to help create and evaluate balance sheets, PnLs, cashflow forecasts, if you're (or anyone else) is interested. 




 Makes sense. I may be wrong, but maybe having 50%+ as one colour would allow you the possibility. 




 Are you investing through your fathers account or on your own? 




 Too young, only 17. Living in France does not help either :( 




 Im sorry if I may be wrong, but isn't the Netherlands, Les Pays Bas, plural, and therefore neither? 




 The green area, "0-9%" should be further subdivided. The natural rate of unemployment is commonly around 4-5%. 9% unemployment is not good by any means, so why is it in the same range with 3% unemployment?

PS. I agree with you. 




 Hey r/investing!

Im having trouble understanding how to buy bonds (I am only interested in government ones) in secondary markets. I understand what face value, coupon, yield, etc. mean and how they are calculated and what they represent; but I fail to understand how to buy them and how the secondary bond market system works.

I would be very grateful if anyone helps :) Besides, bonds are the other side of the coin in investment, and yet, bond investment is so underrepresented here. I am sure an answer here would help at least a couple of you out there.

Thanks for the help, and wish you all the best for your portfolios! :)
