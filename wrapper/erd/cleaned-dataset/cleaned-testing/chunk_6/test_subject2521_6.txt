 OP please provide a link to that post. Thanks! :-) 









 Best bet would be to search the KC area. I know some people who were a part of that group, but they never mentioned anything happening in Lawrence. 




 The United Way of Douglas County provides information about volunteer opportunities in the Lawrence area:

 There's nothing in the wallet? Seems kind of pointless to post about an empty wallet. 

 




 I work at an elementary school and knowing this worries me. During the first week of December, over half of the students in a kindergarten class were sick with the flu and the numbers grew throughout the school.  














 Have you tried Elevate Massage at 14th and Mass? Their deep tissue and hot stone massages are amazing.  




 Factory farms are clearly bad, but what if you raise your own animals as a source of survival? Would that still be deemed bad? I understand that you're pro-vegan, but that is not a style of living everyone is willing to fulfill, or can for varying reasons.
 




 There are monthly game nights at Conroy's Pub. You are bound to find people who love anime. 




 So it's a reddit form of geocaching? o_O
 




 If you want to skip the long lines, order online. You can go straight to the registers and pick up your order.  














 I finished reading it and the entire story  was structured like that. 

Isn't that the sole purpose of confession bear? I'm confessing something that I WILL NOT share with the student. He's only in 3rd grade and still has a lot to learn. But it is sad to see just how much.  




 3rd grade

Thanks for your kind words, asshole 









 They may be experiencing stress due to the weather. Cold and dreary weather can cause stress and/or depression in humans. Dogs and cats may very easily experience the same emotions, especially if they are accustomed to going outside. 




 Winter is coming. Are those in need receiving adequate assistance? If not, why? Lawrencians tend to work for the needs of others, but are we/they living up to that expectation?  




 First time back home in over two years. Spent the day shopping with my mom and ran in to a girl from high school. She smiled and looked excited to see me. I said hi and kept on walking. Felt like a complete bitch afterward, but I didn't feel like talking to someone who treated me like shit in high school.  




 If you were the only one he let hold, how do you expect for the cat to react once you leave home? Adopting him is a must, but it would definitely come as a shock to the cat once you left.  




 Check out the temp agency ExpressPros located on Iowa. They can hire you to start working - a lot of different locations in Lawrence - the very next day.  




 No. I worked with students from K-5 and focused most of my attention on students who needed extra help with their assignments. Before leaving class, several students ran up to me and said 'Bye Miss X' and gave me a hug. It was a great first day.  



















 Kids of this generation are still stuck with the idea 'my vote does not matter'. 

*Hopefully* they will see just how wrong they were and vote in two years.  




 [Audra](http://www.audraesque.com/) is an amazing photographer! 

 




 Did you use a macro lens?

 KU not Lawrence. People don't know what you mean by Lawrence.

 




 Obvious given the day, but still a warning of what to expect.  









 I sing and try not to cry.


That is another thing I like about South Park, they incorporate classic hits that a lot of people from this generation have probably never heard (I am a child of the 80's). Same goes for Family Guy. 




 I cry every time I watch "You're Getting Old". 




 It is great to see that someone is taking the time to break down and understand the social issues portrayed in each episode. I do that for most episodes and my boyfriend thinks I am crazy. Try it sometime, you may be surprised of what you can learn, and further understand, just by watching the show. 

The Simpsons did something like this during their first few seasons. I have yet to figure out why they stopped. Either way, I lost interest in the show.

 Skipper or Barbie? Or do you swing for Ken? 














 Nope. I started writing chapter two with the first pencil but it made my finger hurt...cheap plastic grip. So I changed to the second pencil. 




 It is really easy to make and tastes great! If you decide to bake this, check every 10-minutes to see if it is done. The recipe calls for 40-minutes at 400 F, but it was done in less than 20-minutes.

 Went to a health museum in 3rd grade. Started feeling sick while there and was sent home with a 100+ temperature after returning to the school. We had a morning teacher and an afternoon teacher, so I was sent home after the morning portion of class.

 Easier for people with poor eyesight and those who cannot see through the peephole (i.e. short people). 

I am short and would love to have one on my front door. It would make me feel so much safer, considering where I live.

Edit: words 




 Thank you! :-) 




 Use of passive voice....

I was born to - meant to - do art therapy.  




 I like being optimistic.  




 Working with children and adolescents through art therapy.  




 I have spent the past year applying for jobs throughout the area and this is the first time I finally received a call for an interview. *Hopefully* it pays off.

 Did you bring back any buffalo milk mozzarella? Such a delicacy and it is impossible to find in the US.  




 We rarely ate dinner together, unless it involved the downstairs TV and my brothers and I sitting in front of it eating. 

We weren't and still aren't a close family.

 I know of an Ophthalmologist located in Dallas/Plano, TX. He has helped me tremendously over the past years.

 I agree TV is overrated, but I (and most likely we) live in a First World country. We grew up watching TV (and now more so the internet) where as, she has never owned that luxury. 




 Thanks.

 It tasted great after I added some salt and pepper, and yes, it did. Easy to make and so much better than buying from the store. 

 




 I highly doubt either would work. Using a juicing machine squeezes the juice from the vegetable/fruit and discards the remaining pulp into a separate container. 

There might be information about this on the website.

 It's kale, green apples, ginger and lemon. 




 My Mom: only sluts wear tampons. 

When I told her I bought some for when we were in Key West for vacation - great timing...- she nearly flipped shit. 




 What does that have to do with this post? o_O 




 I agree, but not when you are dealing with Republicans who see everything other than what they believe to be un-American and downright foolish.

They tend to dismiss the possibility of progressive ideas.  




 The problem with online forums is the fact you can never quite be certain which are valid opinions, and which are just trolls. 

Tolerance cannot always be accepted when dealing with trolls. 
 




 I could careless what he/she said, but felt obligated in putting them on the spot due to their comment. 




 People like you bore and disgust me. You're the one who should go away.  














 Nickelodeon, Disney, and Fox were my best friends growing up. Here's a short list of favorite shows.

Animaniacs

Goof Troop

Rugrats

As Told By Ginger

Bobby's World

Ducktales

Welcome to Pooh Corner

Edit: Included a few more shows.
 




 Back in 3rd grade - early 90's - we would watch an episode of Wishbone and The Magic School Bus every week. Great times... 









 Alive but barely breathing.

I've come to the conclusion you'll have a 1 in 10 chance of finding something worth reading or watching each day. But even then, the stories often suck and include nothing but gossip like reporting. 









 Yeah, it is a lot of information to take in at once. Most of their lists are 20-30, not 100. 

Smoke some weed, sit back, and enjoy the video. 

 




 I twitch when a sight or idea scares me. Thanks for the multiple switches. Only thing worse would be if you added a clown to the picture.  




 [LJWorld](http://jobs.lawrence.com/9) has a link for jobs. It requires a 'membership' to join, but it's free and easy to do

[Workforce Center](http://www.workforcecenters.com/lawrence/employ/section/employer_links.htm) has a list of companies in Lawrence.

There are also several temp agencies along Iowa St.

Hope that helps.... 




 Why the fuck did more people upvote this and downvote the link I posted an hour before this one? :-(
I deleted the post after seeing the love and support of this one.

Oh well. Can't wait to see the episode. 

P.S. I look forward to downvotes of this comment. Peace, Love, and Skittles.  




 Jupvote for the jupvote.

F*cking love VSauce. 














 I couldn't think up a creative title, but the video is definitely worth watching. 









 I have used this vet since moving to Lawrence nearly a decade ago.  Even though there are a wide range of veterinarians in the Lawrence area, CPAH is the only location in town that grooms cats. 

I agree with /u/SmirkingRevenge that they are somewhat pricey, but it is well worth the few extra bucks. I have never been dissatisfied and they have a very knowledgeable staff. Unlike vets I have gone to in the past, they will actually explain everything to you and let you know the best options for your pet, instead of trying to sell you things your pet does not need.


 




 The cats are Maru and Hana and their owner posts videos of them every week on his YouTube channel - mugumogu.

Thank you so much and I hope it is an experience worth remembering.  




 Thank you! 




 I was not sure if I should write it with just my approach, or to include my brothers in finding out. I will go ahead and make everything singular. I am more concerned about my own finding out, not my brothers. 

Should I remove that sentence from the first paragraph and leave it as is, without adding more information - my name and finding out? I'll definitely continue with the 'wanting to meet you' at the end of the letter. Also requesting a reply is a better way to approach the subject.

Going too far in-depth with the 23andMe is too much? He's in his early-to-late 70s and I am uncertain whether or not he's that tech savvy, and would have any idea what I was referring to. 

Thank you so much for your advice, I truly appreciate it!  




 Thank you!

 Thanks for the tip. I'll definitely contact Google is this ever happens again.  




 There is a 'male' cup, of which you have, and a 'female' cup. It/she is wearing a bow in its hair instead of a bow tie.  

edit: I deleted an extra space.  




 I dropped my Google Nexus 5 last Thursday and cracked the screen. It's an hour away and receiving some special care. It has been a week and I feel empty. Our separation has had a devastating impact on my life.

Nah, I'm rather well. Frustrated of the fact I procrastinated on buying a case, but that's what I get. The only downside is the fact I can't text my best-friend. Emailing will work for now, but texting is a lot easier...plus sending pictures is way easier than using my DSLR, uploading the pictures, and sending. 

I spend less time reading Digg posts and whatever I come across on reddit. Plus I've spent a lot of my time reading about my favorite subject - art therapy. All in all, the separation was for the better. Everything might change once I have it back.
