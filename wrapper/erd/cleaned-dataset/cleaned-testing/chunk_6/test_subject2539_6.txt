 At least you don't fly to places to fire people.


Watch Up in the Air 




 I enlisted into the Navy just for this reason. Haven't left yet tho, but I hope they didn't lie about the traveling. 




 I probably wont though right:/ what are we like 12 million square miles of area? I'm happy with just seeing a new place at least once a year.

Favorite place I've visited so far was Puerto Rico. I really want to visit the Pacific Northwest and Spain. So, where have you guys gone/where do you want to go?

Is anyone not really into it? I have a couple friends who think that their hometown is perfectly large enough to be explored during their whole lifetime. I dont really understand this type of thinking tho. 




 You have a ron Swanson username lol, way more over the top. I thought Titus was the right amount of "character" for how the show felt . 




 Why don't you wait to see of his job works out before doing anything? 




 Second time we did it she wasn't on her period and it was definitely better, but honestly the first time didn't feel gross for me. All I could think of was how I was getting laid.  




 She had her period and I didn't care, waited 19 years, didn't want to wait any more. It was a good time, probably didn't blow her mind, but it was good for both of us.

Overall the relationship was a huge waste of time though. 




 Lol saw this episode today 




 It will also make you feel hungry  




 He has a book coming out and the kinlde edition of thunderstruck has been on sale for only $1.99 last couple weeks. Also, isn't the NYT lost mostly bullshit? 




 Former pizza guy, glad you Re getting tipped well. The worst is when a wealthy person doesn't tip. Just doesn't make sense. 




 Not fantasy at all, but Stoner by John Williams is about a farm boy who goes to university and falls in love with academia. Its set in the early 1900's in the American south/mid west. 


Shit, when you say English. Do you mean England English? If so, forget what I posted. 




 Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, about a recent wall street trend.


Devil in the white city by Erik Larson, amazing book about the 1893 Chicago world fair, its construction and the serial killer living in the city at the same time. I just finished it a week ago and I find myself thinking about the time in which the story takes place a whole lot.


The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, not too heavy on narrative, sometimes it feels like an info dump, but a very well written and extremely well researched book on Al qaeda and the cia/fbi on the road to 9/11.  




 On episode six and this show is hilarious. I thought the trailer was horrible, but the show is so much better than expected. Its a mix of 30 Rock and Arrested Development. 




 Did aspergers exist before the internet? 




 Its a comedy show 




 Tell those girls you know what you just posted, trust me 




 I'm half way through Storm Front and not really enjoying it. Thank you for saving me some time. 




 Most Vonnegut 




 I've read three of his novels and enjoyed them all, but Michael Chabons "Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" seems very intimidating to me. Its about 600 pages and it won a Pulitzer. I feel like I'm going to judge it harder than I did his other books. What if my expectations are too high? What if Chabons style doesn't work past the 400 page novel? 




 Most important book series ever. Strong in popularity when for the first time ever books had to compete with the internet and video games. An entire generation of readers would have been lost if it weren't for harry potter.


Harry Potter 1, made me want to read Harry Potter 2, that led to 3, and eventually until 7. When I finished the series I said, what now? Now, all the other books. Any book. I just need more stories. Thank you Rowling! 




 The Sun Also Rises. Its more about the beautiful people in 1920's Europe though. Ots also a masterpiece. 




 Yes yes to The Stand and 11/22/63. The Stand specifically has a lot of character growth 




 That's not your fault though. Dont get pushed into something you don't want.  




 Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon. A pot head college professor gets to know a student,  and a lot of other stuff happens. 




 I read AG riddles first book from that trilogy and I skimmed the last 200 hundred pages (the whole second half). Honestly, I dont think it was a well written book, and this one you're reading isn't probably that great either. Just read a summary online of what happens at the end and move on to a better book 




 I have the same fears for myself. I dread that first week more than the whole commitment. 




 Tina Fey Bossypants

Adam Copeland "on Edge" (wrestling autobiography) 




 Besides the ratings system being a total joke, there are other ways to watch. 




 Lol is that a question mark 




 I saw the movie and it made me sad. Does the book add anything? 




 Lucky, I still have over 80 left 




 Really need to watch this one 




 How did you think those would be succesful 




 No you need a recruiter to make you appointments and prescreen you. 




 I'm reading Persepolis right now. Deals more with Islamic revolution than straight Cold War. 




 Great Lakes. I was lazy. But I ended typing it up anyways lol


Thanks for the ama! 




 How often do you get people completely backing out of shipping? Young 18 year olds suck at knowing what they want in life so I would be surprised if you said not many. 




 That $7,500 figure is that the cost of getting them to GL?  




 Haha, not really. Just a socially awkward depper 




 That makes sense. I'm socially awkward so I don't really speak to anyone in the meetings lol...

 




 I ship on 5/12! 

Have you ever been to r/raisedbynarcissists?  I thought my mom was one of a kind, but then I went to that subreddit and found that a lot of parents can be like that. 




 How long till you ship?


My mom cried in anger/sadness the second I called her and told her I swore in. She's more accepting now, but that initial reaction was horrible. 




 What's the point of DEP meetings? I've gone to four already and they all felt like a waste of time. Is it just another weeding out process? 




 The Stand, but I guess I'm confusing writing style for content. 




 There has to be a book like this. Right now a commercial for some vacation hot spot came on television, sandy beaches, drinks, and plenty women. So in my head I instantly went to that place I always go to: What if I took a vacation, and something went horribly wrong?


Is there any good novel in which a vacation goes horribly wrong? Murder, disaster, tragedy anything.

Thanks 




 For the physics or the entertainment? Cause it was entertaining 




 I wasn't even mad. I just told myself mad dog was a twin 




 Oh ok, makes sense. 




 With that degree you'd be dumb to Enlist. Why don't you try officer 




 I dont know much about that job, but from your post I can tell that you want to work on air planes. Question is, where do you want to work on airplanes? Navy has aircraft carriers and multiple Naval Air Stations. Air Force has only land bases. 




 I've read that sometimes new sailors have to do watch after the PIR. Is that true? 




 How was the medical screen during p days ?


What did you do after graduation, did you visit Chicago? 




 Yes, and I had to write some quick mini essays on what happened and why it will never happen again. Also had to speak with a head of recruiting over the phone explaining everything again so that he would aproove the waivers  




 Is it a misdemeanor or a citation? 

Because I got in with misdemeanors.. 




 Did you see any DQ's? 




 I know certain rates get different medical exams, so I'm just wondering about the regular rates, not seal/nuke/aircrew.

Is it just the same as MEPS? 




 I just remembered him as Brad Pitt 




 Who the fuck is Gerry 




 I love it so much, I think people dislike the non-linear storytelling, but I think its great that it did something different than other comic book films. 




 Kingsman really surprised here. They did start putting out better commercials recently, because the first trailer was straight up Cody Banks.


 




 Thank you. I will start squatting.
