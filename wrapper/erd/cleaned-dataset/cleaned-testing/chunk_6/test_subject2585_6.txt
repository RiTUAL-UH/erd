 Thanks so much, sorry I forgot to mention that I go to weekly therapy, and I am on my third different batch of anti depressants so already a step ahead ;) 

Thank you so much :)  




 Hi all. 

I've recently been diagnosed with depression, and am hoping to be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which will make my condition easier to treat, and understand. However, in the process of weekly therapy, anti depressants and doctor appointments, I have lost my sex drive. I have gone from masturbating daily, to only doing it once a week or not even that. I feel I need to wear sexy lingerie to feel good about my body, and my partner constantly reassures me. 

Unfortunately, my diagnosis came around when I was a young teen after being sexually, physically and mentally abused and sometimes this effects our sex life but we have this part under control. However my partner doesn't want to feel like he's forcing me to have sex with him, although he isn't, and so sometimes he goes without sex. 

I just want some help on how to recover the drive, and spice things up a bit. Please keep in mind that this a serious post, and I'd appreciate if this was kept serious too.   




 In the shower, in my/his bed, we once tried on a wall outside his room but that was an epic fail. Lots of car sex too.

 Do you hate me for letting the vet cut off your balls? 




 I have recently been diagnosed with depression, and prescribed anti depressants. In the next weeks, myself and my SO are hoping I will finally be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, as it with really help us understand every thing better. 

In the meantime, I no longer initiate sex or anything sexual. I wear lingerie, purely because it makes me feel sexy and I find it hard to orgasm by myself. My sex drive has dropped from 100 to 30 in the space of a few months, and it is horrid for my.partner and I. 

Any suggestions on how to get back the drive, or even advice on how to spice things up a bit.  




 I cry a lot when pleasure is too much, for example when my SO pounds into me, I cry as it is too much pleasure. I cry during spankings, canings and sometimes just cry because the adrenaline has passed my body and emotions overwhelm me. Crying is my way of releasing, if I don't cry then I'm not being pushed enough. 

I've met people who giggle, or full blown laugh through scenes, not because they are ticklish but because they don't know what else to do!
