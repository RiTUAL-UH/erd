 I think a prison architect stream would be the best way to replay the game.Not an everyday thing just maybe once or twice a week would be really nice and a good break in the usual content 




 I really like alot of the songs in the Eurotruck simulator stream playlist is there a way to access the playlist ?
I went on to spotify but couldn't find the playlist when I searched "Sips".If anyone has a link or instructions on how to get to the playlist that would be great even a screenshot or shots of all the songs
Thank you in advance @_@

 No matter how good someone is or how well trained the winner of the war usually goes to who is motivated more we saw it in the jungles of Vietnam and now we may potentially see it in the desserts of Iraq
