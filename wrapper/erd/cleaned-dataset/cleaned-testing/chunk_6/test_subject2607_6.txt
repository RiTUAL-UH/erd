 Saturday I think. Boys are frustrating and dumb. 




 Idk whenever I have guys over they always want to watch tv or a movie but like, is rather just sit there and talk to them. I'm sure it depends on the girl but she might just want to sit down and have a conversation with you. I'm a loser.

 June 13th 




 Gross one time I went to the movies with my best friend and her boyfriend because I'm a gigantic idiot and at one point I looked over and his hand was literally in her pants like calm down please this is public 




 Be prepared for "LET ME TRY OM YOIR GLASSES" and "LMAO HOW MANT FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP" and "WOW YOURE BLIND HAHAHA". Also from personal experience, "Thanks, I need them to see" isn't the way to respond when someone compliments your glasses. 




 The only other John Green book I've ever read was Looking for Alaska, and it's my favorite book of all time. DEFINITELY worth reading. TFiOS was such a disappointment after that book. 




 Yup, that sounds about right. It actually did make me cry at one point just because he's so innocent. Keep reading to the end, it's worth it. 




 Dark hair and eyes. I always seem to like either tall, funny, chubby, nerdy white guys or cute Hispanic boys with nice smiles and cute accents. 




 Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli for school. 8/10. Made me feel some type of way. 




 FINALLY someone agrees with me. I liked the book but I definitely don't think it deserves all the praise it got. 




 I thought so too XD And it's dejaentenduude.tumblr.com 




 Well I suppose, but I'd rather be closer to home. 




 I looove Weezer and Vampire Weekend 3 I'll go listen to the one you recommended, lol 




 From Brand New I'd try The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot or Magazines. From Bon Iver, try Skinny Love or Creature Fear. Some other bands to try are Counting Crows or The Wallflowers if you haven't already listened to them. What are your recommendations? 




 That's hard. None of them showed up on shuffle, but probably Bon Iver or Brand New. 




 I very much like your music taste :D and thank you! 




 WAIT I FOLLOW YOU ON TUMBLR. You liked on of my selfies on there the other day. What.

 I used to be obsessed with this. Being from Detroit, the end always made me laugh way too hard. 




 Deja Entendu - Brand New
Pure Heronie - Lorde
For Emma, Forever Ago - Bon Iver

Probably my top 3 favorites ever  




 One of my top 3 favorites. 




 http://dejaentenduude.tumblr.com is mine, but it has no rhyme or reason, it's just whatever I happen to feel like reblogging 




 - I don't care about how big your penis is, please don't mention it anymore because it's creepy

- I wish you could just be open with me and tell me if you don't like me because it's emotionally exhausting trying to read you

- I feel like you're replacing me after we've been best friends for the last 5 years 

For three different people. 




 That made me sad :( 




 The lack of being able to double tap to reply makes me cry 




 There's a guy who lives in my neighborhood with a bunch of reddit bumper stickers. Never actually talked to him. 




 Congrats on the medals to you guys too!(: 




 I think the paper planes are fun until matches start and people start giving speeches. I hope that the plane that landed by Dean wasn't actually aimed at him and was just unpredictably flying and happened to land by him (not that they should've been flown while he was talking anyway). But I think the planes can be fun if they're flown at the right times and aren't out of hand. But yeah, sucks to be whoever has to clean them all up. 




 That is awesome! I love all those teams. 51 is probably my favorite frc team besides my own and these teams all worked together extremely well 




 In the 33.3 percent. Fucking Detroit. 




 I'm sophomore in high school, that's my dream college oh my gosh  




 Reese's cups. Oh my god, do not let those things in my sight. 




 They're not super popular haha. But they're very eclectic, I love thence. 




 I originally wanted a cute short almost pixie-ish haircut but it's too hard to maintain since I have curly hair so now it's like shoulder length with a metric fuck ton of layers and straightened every day, parted to the side. I miss my long hair a lot tho. 




 Vices by Brand New. Ugh. Daisy in general was a bit of a flop imo. I still love it but it can't even compete with Dj Entendu or The Devil and God. 




 I wish I was less sensitive. Every little thing makes me upset. And I wish I was less of an open book and less trusting, because it has fucked me over in the past. Also I need to stop putting the feelings of others before my own feelings. Probably my biggest issue is my social anxiety though. I'd love to see a version of myself that isn't scared of social situations and that could talk to people my age without feeling awkward and walking away. 




 I had to end up learning gradually through internet, friends, vague things at school. I don't recall the exact age but yeah, my mother avoided the subject 




 YES. Wounded Healer is my favorite. 




 5: At college (REALLY hoping for Michigan tech or U of M) working on some kind of engineering degree
10: Steady job, steady income. Hopefully good friends and a good relationship.
20: Married with kids and a family, with an overall happy life, being able to continue an engineering career with good pay while doing something I love. 




 Spent it in St. Louis at the world champion robotics competition. Best time of my life. 




 I've literally NEVER heard of curving a quiz down. That's bullshitty. 




 I had zero interest in boys until fifth grade. Then it was a super tall redheaded boy with freckles and super green eyes. And he was really funny and could crack me up. Holy cow though my feelings were so strong at the time, probably because it was my first crush. But he's a douche now so lol oh well 




 ":c Feel better. Good night." To my ex boyfriend. Sigh. 




 Music and engineering. I like most sciences and stuff but damn I love engineering (especially that of the chemical and mechanical variety) 




 One time in 5th grade I had to go to the hospital because I got pencil lead stuck in my ear. That counts, right? 




 Bed: 12:00-2:00
Wake up: 5 on Tuesday/Thursday and 6:15 every other day

I'm not a smart person. 




 My team is from the Flint/Detroit area as well, so I know what you mean, lol. But I didn't even think about the Jr. FLL teams there. I already get nervous about the FRC and FTC teams, but at least we're all old enough to hold our ground, the FLL teams aren't. Aw. That's really scary. :( 




 I agree. I think the area as a whole is pretty sketchy. I read about a student on one team on here who got mugged outside the hotel. That could happen anywhere, but St. Louis really isn't the safest of all places in my opinion. 




 The build process on my team is very student-led. I think that the thing the mentors help with the most is designing the robot. While the mentors help on some things that they feel are dangerous for students to do, they try very hard to let us do the majority of the build. Usually when you have a question, the mentors will not give you a direct answer. They ask what you think the answer is and they walk you through the steps to get to the correct answer. I would rather have a robot that doesn't win a whole lot that is built all by students than have a robot that wins everything but was made by the mentors. I wouldn't feel like I could take as much credit since my team didn't actually build it, my mentors did. Granted, my team has 45 students and with that amount of people, we can work efficiently build a robot in 6 weeks. With smaller teams more mentor involvement is necessary in my opinion, because there are less people to give out their ideas and less people to work on the robot. I think that if the mentors did most of the work on the robot, it would almost be defeating the purpose of FIRST. 




 Good luck! We love the Thunder Chickens3 




 That's so unbelievably unsafe. Why is this not being reported or signal boosted? People shouldn't be paying 15 bucks for food poisoning and a coke. 




 What about if someone robs your house? By that logic, they should just be able to get away with it because "the law is bullshit" am I right? 




 We're in Galileo too, so good luck! I'll try to snag you a 3098 button if I get around to it (: 




 I'm from 3098 and LOVE your shirts. I don't really have anything to trade, but is there anywhere online where they are sold? 




 I have an ex boyfriend who is currently living across the country who I still try to help and support to no end and yet his friends still all hate me. He was just in the hospital, and his friends all gave up on him feeling better, and got mad at ME for staying positive and saying he would make it. Guess who got out of the hospital earlier this week? Him. While he was there, one of his friends told me "The reason he hasn't given up yet is because you don't want him to" After I tried telling him how much he was still needed and how he couldn't give up. The same thing happened in December. I broke up with him in a pretty bad way back in December and I have apologized sincerely, and I've even been TOLD that they all have forgiven me. Yet they still can't stand me and I've done nothing but try to help him and stay close friends with him. His friends are some of the most fantastic and protective and caring people I have ever talked to, and there have been times after we have broken up where I can joke with his friends and be extremely friendly, but that won't happen again anytime soon. The whole hospital situation really drew the "they really can't stand me" line, even though I supported every single one of them the best I could. We have stayed very close since we broke up, and I still love him. I don't think I could ever get back together with him though because I'm not very emotionally stable sometimes and don't trust myself with him. Additionally, our personality clashes have been really evident as of late. I'm an open book, and he hates talking about his feelings. I sometimes find It hard not to try to pry when I notice things are wrong. It caused a REALLY awful argument last month, and up until then we would still say I love you to one another, but we didn't think we were ready for an actual relationship again. As a couple, we never had those problems. If he ever offered a relationship again, I would tell him I would think about it, but as I think about it and am honest with myself, I realize how likely it is that I would actually get back together with him. Honestly, I still cry on a pretty regular basis when I realize how badly I fucked up by breaking up with him, and I was told a few weeks ago that he still kind of has feelings for another girl, and I felt really awful about that too. I'm not going to even try to talk to him for at least a couple of weeks. Things still need to cool down between me and his friends, and I think it's healthier for me to not try to talk to him. But god damn, do I love and miss him. 




 My favorite part is when you're in a hurry and you awkwardly have to slide past them and you end up brushing against them 




 Lola Montez - Volbeat
I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys
Triggerfinger - Donkeyboy
Latch - Disclosure
This Too Shall Pass - OK Go
Slipped - The National 




 That's awesome! :D 




 I feel you. 




 I already have my heart set on Michigan Tech.

I think I have a pretty good chance if getting in, considering my decent GPA (3.67), and the fact that I'm in my school's robotics program and am going to an engineering camp there this summer.  




 ... Smith. :( 




 This makes me sad. 




 Same thing happened to us at the Southfield district competition. A match got replayed for that reason after a powerhouse team lost a match, but other matches didn't get replayed when the same thing happened. 




 It was a lot of fun. Super excited for worlds.

 As lame as it is I honestly l o v e d the Jason Mraz concert I went to in 2012. 




 [This](http://imgur.com/jTV436X) Was once a normal looking and intact big bird doll, but I took this thing literally EVERYWHERE from the time I was a baby until I was about 6. It means a lot to me because it's the one thing that sums up my time as a little kid because he went everywhere that I went, and all the paint chips and limbs being halfway torn off have little stories.
