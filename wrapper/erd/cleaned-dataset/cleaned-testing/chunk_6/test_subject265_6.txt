 I disagree with that assertion. Once an officer draws his firearm, there are few if any options other than shooting and killing his target. They're equipped with tasers, pepper spray, batons, and other options.  




 You explicitly claimed to have taken it. I don't know why anyone would believe you after you blatantly and needlessly lied like that. This photo was posted in this sub twelve hours before your post.  




 Thanks for the info. 

He wasn't being unruly. He was sitting down holding a camera with both hands. They definitely could have done more to communicate and reason with the guy. You can say it was justified all you want, but if that old man (as cantankerous and obnoxious as he is) were to have been shot and killed, or anyone else in that room had been shot and killed, all of this would have been a moot issue. Those guards are there to protect everyone in that room and they undoubtedly failed.  




 Thanks. I apologize for my hateful remarks too. 

You didn't specify the person was mentally ill. You're moving the goalposts here dude. 

This is how that situation works. You either give him the benefit of the doubt and treat him like a human being, or you find out about his mental health issues when he's already on ice. I understand that officer safety is important, but the people you encounter each day are just that, people. I've argued with officers on here that felt that the shooting of James Boyd was completely justified. It's easy for me to get worked up when I think I'm talking to someone with no respect for human life. 
 




 Was he OP? When "you took this picture"? I understand reposting, but was it really necessary to claim that you're the one who actually took the photo and fabricate some bullshit story about it? 

**OP is a big fat phony!!** 




 Yes, the internet must ensure that never goes away.  




 The deleted comment below was the one in which OP claimed that he took this photo. 

**OP is a big fat phony!!** 




 **OP is a big fat phony!!** 




 There's not a snowball's chance in hell. If anything, this frothy mixture is a walking talking advertisement for the Democratic party.  




 Source? Everything I've read said he wasn't arrested or charged. 

Regardless, that security guard fucked everything up here. He didn't announce himself or his intentions. He went right for the camera that was strapped to the man's neck. Obviously anything related to the neck is going to trigger a fight or flight response as well as involuntary reactions. There's not a single excuse for the guard's lack of communication. He went directly to physical violence. He had no justification to put his hands on that man or his property. That guy is an unprofessional hack. Police officers (and apparently ex police officers) are violent thugs. When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  




 Clearing rooms and using a firearm as a compliance device are two different things.  




 I wasn't talking about this video. I was talking about the aforementioned scenario. 

If someone was an actual threat and unwilling to listen to reason, and I had backup, a taser, and pepper spray. I would start with the taser. Two adult men in reasonable shape with multiple "less lethal" options should be able to disable and restrain a suspect. If not, then keep him at bay until more help can arrive. There's also [this] (http://www.slashgear.com/police-test-less-lethal-bullet-alternative-17369435/) and other stuff like it. There's no reason to go straight for lethal weaponry when dealing with unarmed American citizens.  




 I cry afoul because often times the police are lying when they say a subject tried to grab their gun or otherwise. 

He did break the law. An actual cop cannot take your camera. This guy is a private security guard. The fact that he broke the law was illustrated by the fact that old man wasn't arrested or even detained.  




 It's not the printing presses that should fund the basic income. If you'd read a bit about the topic, you'll find that it's perfectly viable through progressive taxation. It's going to be necessary too, because soon enough no one will be able to afford any of the products that capital produces.  




 I dunno, that piece of shit was trying to steal his camera, and it looked like the old man got a few good licks in. I know I'd rather not get my face beat in by a geriatric.  




 Thank you for your simple explanation as to how you'd justify killing a mentally ill person. You're a fucking coward. 

Edit: Make sure you take a screen shot of this comment to show all of your buddies.  




 You're in /r/basicincome, so you should be able to guess what my solutions would be. 

Your solutions just shore up the wealth of the already wealthy. They wouldn't do anything to help the working classes.  




 That doesn't have the slightest chance of being passed. If the GOP keeps up with this level of rhetoric, they may find it impossible to pass any legislation for the foreseeable future.  




 And they use assjacks like Rick Santorum to drug you into a coma.  




 Well, I think the distinction that it's not paint or some other permanent medium is relevant.  




 That's fucked up. Put up some flour pasted posters in that decaying shithole of a town and they treat you like you've defaced the Taj Mahal.  




 You don't have my respect and I doubt you'll be earning any here by insulting other veterans. Where would grunts be without the tactical and technical assistance of others? You're a jackass and a insult to every uniform you wear. 

I'm not trying to intimidate you. I'm not like you. I'm not driven by the basest instincts and drives. 

I'm pointing out the giant holes in your logic. You're talking about being back into corners? Answer my question piggy. 

This is why you are not supposed to pull a firearm unless you fully intend to use it to kill; where do you go from there, hot shot? You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs. You shoot an unarmed person because you chose to over escalate the situation. 


You're talking about killing your way out of corner you created for yourself. There's no honor in needlessly killing unarmed people.  




 Yup. It's called the constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered by the protections enumerated in the constitution. 

Edit: forgot a few key words.  




 Man, fuck you. Every veteran has earned the respect of the uniform they wore and the service they provided to their country. You're a fucking scumbag. 

You're already getting combat veterans here arguing with you. I'd quit while I was ahead if I were you. 

Edit: Also why don't you answer the question in my other comment? Where do you go from there, officer pigshit?  




 Yes during the initial invasion you guys were obviously on the offensive. But afterward things changed right? And like you said, that was war. 

It seems after taking another look at your comment we're really on the same side.  




 No. Taxes are not too high. American effective tax rates aren't any higher than most other places. And instead of creating treaties and agreements that make things easier for these guys, we should be creating international agreements to reign in tax havens and hold these companies accountable. Apple is doing that because, as of yet, there haven't been any meaningful repercussions for doing so. It's time we started making these assholes pay for the things they do.  




 My thoughts exactly. Doesn't Shepard Fairy just do posters? Is an internationally acclaimed artist putting up posters in their post apocalyptic city really an appropriate use of police resources?  




 I am a veteran. I did not see combat but I was trained to use a firearm. How dare you insult my service or the service of anyone else simply because we had different specialties. Fuck you pig. 

The combat veterans I know have explained that they had very strict rules of engagement. Nothing like the bullshit the police get away with here. I'm sure within a few hours some other veterans will add to this.  




 Oh, C'mon man. Of course an officer has the same right as anyone else to defend himself. If someone actually attacks an officer or tries to tear something out of their hands that obviously warrants the use of force. Use of force  equal to beating the shit out of someone 

That rarely happens. Usually the officer is the aggressor. There are countless videos on here of cops trying to steal people's cameras and assaulting them. Cops purposefully engage a person in a way that elicits an involuntary response. Like putting their hands on and pushing people in the chest or neck. Grabbing a person's extremities and bending them in a way that forces your body to react. 

Don't give me this bullshit that people aren't being fair to cops. The asshole in the video blatantly walked over to the elderly gentleman and grabbed his camera which was around his neck. What did he expect to happen when he broke the law, violated this man's person, and tried to steal his property?  
























 Yes, it's a development. Granted it's a depressing development that doesn't progress the prosecution of these killers, but it's definitely a development. You are an idiot. You shouldn't talk to people about things or post comments on the internet about topics that you're not willing to read about. When you do this, you waste everyone's time, including your own.  




 Computers aren't responsible for wage stagnation. 

Fly away executive pay and income inequality are the result of the regression of our tax system. We removed the disincentives for insane levels of executive pay when we pulled back the top marginal tax rates. Our tax system is effectively regressive at this point. Executives can command unlimited levels of pay and neither they nor their employers face any tax penalties. So naturally that's where all of the new revenue is going to go. This has also resulted in wage stagnation so it's no coincidence that wage stagnation began in the late seventies/early eighties when the top marginal tax rates were effectively neutered.  




 Again did you read the fucking article? 

It's a development because a group of activists tried using an obscure state law to circumvent the regular grand jury process to bring charges against the officers. This story is about how that process failed and their affidavit was dismissed even though the initial judgement was that there was probable cause to bring multiple charges. Now it's up to the DA to bring charges and it doesn't look good. 

Read the article you fucking putz.  




 That's just pure incompetence. I don't know if they're using this bullshit to sell papers or just distract the public from real news like the TPP, but they should be ashamed of themselves.  




 I'm more curious about whether the other user is full of shit.  




 He's eager to kill.  




 Where did you find this because a different user posted the exact same picture and claims that he took it. 

Edit: yeah, turns out that the other user was full of shit.  




 Oh, I know he is. Pretty pathetic if you ask me. 

Edit: We did it. Op backed out of his initial claim that he took the photo.  




 What you're saying isn't wrong, but it doesn't explain the wage stagnation of the last 30+ years.  




 You have a valid point. I really doubt this is actually his photo anyway.  




 Maybe a ruling with a settlement that actually hurts the system will be cause for change. $5 million isn't shit for the bureaucrats in NYC.  




 It doesn't look good does it? I dunno, I'll give OP at least an hour before I make a decision.  




 This is why you are not supposed to pull a firearm unless you fully intend to use it to kill; where do you go from there, hot shot? You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs. You shoot an unarmed person because you chose to over escalate the situation.  




 You're confused because those of us in the military and the general public are trained to treat firearms with respect and to only use them for their intended purpose which is to kill people and animals. 

We don't get the "gun as a deadly compliance device" training.  




 That's not true.  




 Is this actually your photo? 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3d2l8a/lafayette_indiana_cop_parks_in_handicap_spot/

This was posted 12 hours before your post.  




 How is anything that I said disrespectful? Did you read the article?  




 Right, the ruling class aren't properly compensating their employees because of the gold standard. Der.  




 I imagine a swab is all that's necessary. They're trying to establish origin.  




 You understand that it's a movie right?  




 This is a new development in an old case. Do you ever read the article?  




 Well, they certainly weren't condemning it* either. There's at least one law enforcement rapist story posted here daily. Quite a few of the victims are children. 

So you really just guessed?  




 There are no accidents involving firearms and trained professionals. Weapons don't fire themselves.  




 That's $51k to $66k with next pay grade being $61k to $79k. Let's not forget housing allowance, COLA, medical and dental coverage, an amazing retirement package, incredible job security, and a bunch of other benefits. It's not like they're the most under paid people in the world.  




 Right, and they don't deserve to be individually doxxed.  




 I would delete this comment if I were you. Just a heads up, this is grounds for a shadowban.  




 Oh, he must be one of those "bad apples" I'm always hearing about.  




 Okay too many commas. It's not worthy of all of hate you're giving it.  




 Maybe he shouldn't have attempted to steal the man's camera.  




 [Yes, it did happen.] (http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/nypd-sergeant-throws-semen-on-his-crush.html)  




 Yeah no shit. Wouldn't it makes sense to compare Bates to Gein and not the other way around? 

Edit: Why am I being downvoted? Bates is a **fictional character** based loosely upon Gein the **real person**. 




 Yet another Southerner here. I grew up with the Dukes of Hazzard. To me, it says good 'ol boys who never meant no harm. Yeah, it's the Rebel flag, but that's the point. It's rebellion. IMO, it would be extremely appropriate if someone used it in a protest against the NSA.


Jesus Christ, did he read any of the arguments against it?  




 That's a book, not a peer reviewed study. 

Edit: added a comma.  




 Oh c'mon, man. That quote can from an AARP blog post that provided no sources and no statistics. Those people choosing to be with different types of partners doesn't mean they went from gay to straight. 

The second link was to a study on sexual plasticity. I wasn't asking for proof of sexual plasticity. I was asking for a source on your claim:

There are a non-trivial amount of cases of gay people becoming "straight" 




 Well we certainly shouldn't be publicly funding a program that largely confuses kids and fails to meet its main goal.  




 This needs publicity and awareness. People need to be reminded about what they get by voting Republican.  




 There are a non-trivial amount of cases of gay people becoming "straight"

Source? 

 




 I was talking about the next smart ass comment. 

They lost the war. Sorry for being so ~~brunt~~ blunt and I do accept the downvotes.

+117

It's because "they lost", and not because they weren't heroes, but instead murderous brutes.  




 It doesn't matter where you are sugar, it's your bedtime. Goodnight.  




 I'm in a predominantly red state, Missouri, and I'm not opposed to Medicaid expansion or subsidies, but I can confirm that is a very common view point. It's odd too, because from what I gather it seems to be largely motivated by misinformation and outright lies. Most people don't actually understand how Medicaid expansion or subsidies work.  




 "And I do accept ze downvotes for mein Fatherland, mein Reich and mein Fhrer!" 




 So the wealthy don't pay into and then receive social security when they retire? No, everyone gets social security. It's not like wealthy people have ever been known to turn down extra money.  




 I'm not a lawyer. I'm a taxpayer and a voter. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I'm simply stating my opinion. You're obviously as firm in your convictions as I am.  




 And what do you know, yours began with and has been sustained solely on personal attacks. Now run along to bed. You don't want your mom to take away your internet privileges.  




 How clever. Go to sleep. It's past your bedtime.  




 If you looked at my initial comment you would see that I said percentage. Keep in mind when all is said and done the Romneys are left with more than $11 million to live on whereas the median income family is out more than a fifth of their living expenses (that's right, not just their incomes). They've contributed a fifth of their living expenses (that's food taken out of mouths, medicine and doctors visits that have to be skipped, necessities like a new roof or a new transmission that they'll somehow make do without) and you and Romney call them lazy and moochers. 

You are a simple child. You have no business discussing these things. Go to bed kiddo. 

Edit: your numbers are wrong. The total tax on the median family $10k. Which means that the Romneys pay 213 times that of the median family, which would make sense considering that they take home 282 times the income.   




 I'm done with you. You make claims and haven't provided a single source. To my sources you simply say "that didn't exist" or "that doesn't happen". Sure you can simulate the experience of winning an argument by never actually providing one. You're willfully ignorant and dangerously dense. Furthering this discussion is a waste of my time. Good night.  




 You dismissed my example and then provided one that you're certain needs to die. You're saying an innocent dead man isn't relevant because *you know* this other one is guilty. My argument is that there's no way to know. As I pointed out before, everyone *knew* that Willingham was guilty.  




 So you're saying that it's okay if the Willinghams die as long as we get to kill the Roofs? 




 No, they pay [around 20%](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) give or take, and I just posted a pretty clear explanation as to how a family earning the median American income can end up paying more than that.  




 Hehe. Thesaurus. Good one.  




 You obviously don't understand how sales taxes work.

Lets take the Romneys. I just read that he paid 14.1% on his income of $13.7 million. That's $1,931,700 in taxes leaving them with $11,768,300. Now how much do you think the Romneys need to live? Let's be generous and say they **spend** $2,000,000. Sales taxes are usually between 8% and 12% so let's just go with an even ten percent. That would be around $200,000 putting their total tax at $2,131,700. Or 15.5% their annual income. 

Let's do this with a median income family. The link I sent you puts their effective tax rate at 12.7% of $50,000 or $6,350 leaving them with $43,650. Now, a family of three or four will most likely spend every cent on living expenses just to survive. So assuming they spend all $43,650, $4,365 is going to go to sales taxes. Leaving them with $39,285 making their total tax rate around 21.5%. 

See how it works when you present an actual argument instead of dismissing and insulting people with no supporting evidence?  




 Because you're a bootlicking apologist and your only concern is defending the police and obfuscating the topic at hand.  




 That's why I said this has nothing to do with the gold standard.  




 **The tactics of racial profiling,**

Not at all nice, but not equivalent to genocide. 

We're not talking about genocide. That was clarified more than once. Try to focus, will ya. 


**warrantless searches,**


Cops generally aren't allowed to do this. 

It's called stop and frisk, and it happens in most major cities. 


**civil forfeiture,**


What's wrong with civil courts?

You should read about the practice of [civil forfeiture. ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) It has little to do with civil courts or justice. It's state sponsored theft. 


**military tactics**


What are "military tactics?" That term means nothing unless you define it. 

Using military uniforms, weapons, and equipment on civilian populations. Storming private residences before dawn. Etc


**secret police**


I wouldn't call US police "secret" given their habit of dressing in clearly noticeable vehicles and running around in marked cars. 

US drug task forces are most definitely secret police. They dress as civilians and drive unmarked vehicles. They're allowed to break all sorts of laws in their pursuit of suspects and convictions. For someone who really wats to argue about this topic you sure are ignorant. 


**criminal informants,**


Who's going to know what criminals are up to? Think very carefully. I know it's hard, but I think you can answer this question.

Criminal informants are [people and often children] (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/03/the-throwaways) with substance abuse or other problems who are extorted into doing police work at their own peril and expense. 


**black site interrogations**


American police don't do this. 

[This is getting really old, man] (http://www.rawstory.com/2015/03/chicago-police-commander-who-ran-homan-square-black-site-quits-amid-new-lawsuit-threat/) You're aware that you can do your own research, right? Your ignorance is your own responsibility. 


**warrantless surveillance**


So what? 

Really? You're perfectly fine with this? Do you not understand how historically, this sort of thing does not end well. 


**no-knock raids**


So what? 

[This is on example of what these lead to.] (http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/) If the evidence being sought can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes then theres no excuse for using a swat team and violating the rights of a suspect. If they're looking for a person they can get a warrant and surveil the premises until they locate them, or you know, "do their fucking jobs". 


**summary executions**


US police don't do this. 

US police kill at least one person every eight hours. Plenty of them have been summary executions. [James Boyd] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U), [Tamir Rice] (https://youtu.be/mSCftESyKyU) are a couple of examples. 


**character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens,**


Or either of these things for that matter. 

During the Baltimore protests the police fabricated and disseminated falsehoods about Freddie Gray and other Baltimorians. Every time there is a police shooting the first thing the police do is release the victims criminal history regardless of how irrelevant or unsubstantiated it may be. In absence of any character damning information, they go after the victims friends, family, and associates. 


**It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened.**


A lot of people in Germany didn't like Jews. 

Oh that's true. But there's much more to it and there's is a lot to compare to the US. In case you haven't noticed, we have a few problems with racial tensions and race relations in this country. Most of the people who are targeted as an excuse for the increasing militarization of the police are racial and ethnic minorities. We also have a lot of economic problems that can be used to antagonize racial issues. If you can't see some similarities here, then you should find a different past time because you don't get history at all. 


**Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history.**


Except they weren't. You don't need a complex bureaucracy like the Nazis had to commit genocide. As the Rwandans were nice enough to show us, all you really need are tools and men. Every nation on earth has that. 

Rwandans aren't Germans. Germany needed the complex bureaucracy, hence it's construction and maintenance. You're working from the assumption that the nazis were able to seize power solely on a general hatred for Jewish people. That's simply not true. Of course it was a factor, but Germany had gone through decades of economic turmoil and were fertile ground for fascism to take hold. Hitler promised economic recovery which he delivered via unsustainable militarization. The German people were spiteful from losing WWI and felt that they were being treated unfairly by the rest of Europe. They used this as justification for their invasion of Poland. The Jewish people weren't their only scapegoats. The Reich demonized and euthanized the disabled, Roma people, communists, and literally anyone else they deemed undesirable. Yes the Jewish Holocaust was the very pinnacle of their evil, but it's shortsighted to ignore all of their other crimes. 

 




 Way to be objective pal. Go ahead and look up [effective tax rates.] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) You'll see that there isn't a big difference from the bottom rung and the top rung. Then you have to consider sales taxes. When a family only has an income of $50k (median American income), everything they earn is spent. When you account for sales taxes on lower income families you might as well just add that sales tax straight to their effective tax rate. When you do that you'll see that the poor often pay more than the rich.  




 You and I obviously aren't having the same conversation. Propaganda is only one of the number police tactics and  crimes that I mentioned. 

The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups.

History isn't just about memorizing facts and figures. It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened. Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history. Ignoring those factors is to ignore the fundamental basis of their crimes.  




 One could argue that [righteousness is a theistic concept.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteousness) 

[This guy was a case where every authority figure involved was absolutely sure of his guilt.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham) He's dead now, and things don't seem so clear cut.  




 Ahh.  




 I would hardly call that the black market, especially considering that you're allowed to buy a reasonable amount for personal use.  




 The same could be said about cannabis users today. A gargantuan black market that is present in literally every community, nation wide.  




 Actually that's untrue. The rich barely pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes and in many cases they pay less.  




 What?  




 I haven't been downvoting you, but I may now. 

"You people"? That's always a big hit. 

I'm not sure how an atheist can be "righteous".  Or that righteousness is even relevant. 

We could look at being fiscally conservative and how the death penalty and its required appeal system is simply inefficient and expensive costing tens of millions of dollars per death row inmate. 

We can look being effective and compare the murder rates of states that have capital punishment vs states that do not and conclude* that the threat of the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for capital crime. We can also acknowledge that life without parole is far worse than a death sentence as it offers no quick and easy conclusion for the condemned. 

We can look at being just and acknowledge that as many as 4% of the inmates sitting on death row were wrongly convicted. What percentage or number of innocents killed in the name of political and judicial expediency would be acceptable to you? And if those people were your loved ones or even you yourself? 

The only "rational" argument for the death penalty would be revenge, retribution, vengeance, wrath, whatever you wanna call it. But I wouldn't call it rational. It's emotional and zealous. It's about instant and total gratification not thoughtful deliberation. Not what we want or need out of criminal justice system.  




 Now? Did it ever stop being murder? Or maybe just in your mind? 

Regardless of what you think, I'd prefer the state not murder people in my name or with my tax dollars.  




 No worries.  




 Well, yeah they disarmed the jews. No argument there. They also relieved those innocent people of their personal possessions, wealth and property, and ultimately their lives. 

Not much gun control is occurring in the US. There is however a push toward the militarization of the police, a complete disregard for constitutional protections, and a general attitude that the police in general and individual officers can do no wrong.  




 Not because he was nervous, because he murdered a child.  




 Nope. Guns were banned in the 20's, but gun regulations were relaxed in 1928, five years before the rise of the Reich. [Then in 1938 gun regulations were relaxed even further.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany)  




 You forgot "stop needlessly violating rights and endangering lives".  




 Yes this, except for D.A.R.E. which is a complete waste of time and money, and as some studies have suggested, can actually increase the rate of teen drug abuse.  




 If the amount of evidence in question is so small that it can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes, then there's no rational argument for using a swat team to preserve the scene through brute force. Knock on the door and see what you get. There's no need to violate anyone's constitutional rights or endanger anyone's life. 

By the way, a drug dealing operation is by definition "a business".

What makes you so sure that all employers would be so willing to show up to court like you say? What makes you so certain that they too wouldn't be eager to destroy incriminating evidence? 

Why aren't the police even sending out letters to these employers? Obviously when someone works hard for hourly wages and tips and the theft of these funds constitutes a crime with an obvious victim. Why aren't the authorities zealously prosecuting these crimes?  




 Double comment.  




 And that's what this article was about. A different judge ruled that it's up to the DA to bring charges. So I'm here arguing that the system of justice should be allowed to continue through with charges. Really at this point it looks like simple biased obstruction to those of us who want to see these killers face trial.  




 No, that was a question? Don't have an answer?  




 Again, the numbers are so disproportionate that a division by 5 isn't going to do much. Like the article stated, US police have killed as many people in the last 24 days as the British have in the last 24 years. 

If you took the number that the British have killed in the last 24 years and multiplied it by five, it would be 275 over 24 years. What does that change? American police have killed more than 600 this year alone. The total number dead in the 24 years in question would be closer to 20,000 as a conservative estimate. So then you're looking at 275 (corrected for population) vs 20,000. See what I'm saying. Population correction doesn't make things look much better. Or you can go the other route and divide the US down to 4,000 (conservative estimate /5 over 24 years) for 55 vs 4,000. Still looks really really bad. 

Edit: US police kill people at a rate 72 times that of British police (corrected for population size) or 363 times without correction.  




 Maybe Hitler wasn't such a monster, he just lost who writes history, besides it was ww2. 

Right, fact. /s Makes perfect sense. 

 




 I already read what you have to say. You think these officers were justified and shouldn't face charges.

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

This judge disagrees with you.  




 Why aren't the police performing raids on employers responsible for wage theft and other labor violations?  




 I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. First because these two spineless turds executed that boy, and now again because of apologists like you who would defend their crimes. Go to PnS. They'll let you sit in the middle of the circle jerk.  




 And that attitude is ridiculously stupid and shortsighted. It's important to recognize* all of the causes and conditions that created an environment in which they could commit such atrocities. And trust me, there are plenty of historians and otherwise who take into account the entirety of their crimes. If you want to be willfully ignorant, that's fine. Just don't expect others to accept that as a valid argument for anything.  




 Again, you should learn about this topic before rendering an opinion. The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups. Yes, the nazis committed genocide, but that wasn't the total extent of their crimes. 

Edit: added two.  




 Right. It's naive to consider the whole picture rather than rushing to judgement as a result of bloodthirsty vengeance. If you had anything useful to add here you should have done that instead of posting a vague insult without any supporting information or theory.  




 Right. /s 




 None of what you just said makes any sense, let alone could any of it be considered a valid argument for or against anything. Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad.  




 You should read about the actions and systems of the Third Reich beginning with their rise to power in 1933. Of course the holocaust was the peak of their depravity, but their motives and tactics from the beginning weren't as far from those employed by US police forces as you might think.  




 Hold on, now. Being kind to animals doesn't necessarily make a person fair or humane. Hitler was a vegetarian and an animal advocate who enacted animal cruelty laws. 

Yes, what he did here was absolutely commendable, but this guy could still be a total shithead. 

Edit: added paragraph break.  




 I'm assuming that you meant to type "basic Christian doctrine"? And yes, it's fucked up reasoning that can be used to rationalize literally anything and everything.  




 Or the ever-applicable explanation that it was all "god's will". Which means that god does exist, but he's a heartless monster that cares no more for innocents than he cares for murderers.  




 Yuck! Same here. Those people are terrible. Though, it's scary to honestly think about how many people actually believe shit like that.  




 Is that usually a valid argument in the case of hit and run accidents? "Your honor, the other vehicle was completely destroyed. There was no reason to believe that the driver survived. My client saw no benefit in stopping to call emergency authorities." Or does this excuse only work for law enforcement?  




 You're missing the point. The purpose of a trial is to determine guilt. You cannot determine guilt without a trial. It's not up to the prosecutor to decide, it's up to the jury. You're using cyclic reasoning to argue against a trial. There is probable cause and compelling video evidence. Let a jury decide. If the killers were anyone other than law enforcement, this wouldn't even be a discussion.  




 Again, a judge has already established that they do. Why are you so hellbent on shielding these sacks from a fair trial? There's video evidence. A judge has ruled that there's probable cause for charges. Let a fucking jury decide.  




 I'm pretty sure that a decent prosecutor could make a damn good argument that this is a case of sexual assault.  




 You're actually defending this scumbag for fleeing the scene of a fatal accident, because his victim was already dead? Are there no limits to the depths that you police apologists will sink?  




 Trolls gotta troll.  




 Tell it to the jury. All you're doing is arguing for obstructing the judicial process.  




 This has nothing to do with the gold standard.  




 Facts aren't even a tool of the right. How could they possibly claim any sort of domain over them? The reason OP was showing you the door is that you obviously don't care about the facts.  




 I agree. I couldn't resist the chance to punch a hole in that argument, though. Thanks for the opportunity.  




 There is video evidence of these crimes. Let a fucking jury decide.  




 Per capita does little to affect the numbers on this topic. Undeniably, police in the US kill people at a much higher rate. Population size has nothing to do with it.  




 Thanks.  




 I imagine that some of the funding is coming from industry players who have a long term interest in seeing such programs installed elsewhere and expanded as much as possible.  




 This is terrifying. I live in a poor area of town and I've never been in trouble with the law. I've never been a violent person wnd I have an infant child. I know for a fact that the house I rent has been raided multiple times before I moved in here. I wonder if such a system would mark my residence as a "red threat" even though it's a rental property?  




 All that work, but no nothing to note an edit. Tsk, tsk.  




 This is the problem, a judge has already established that there is probable cause to bring charges and prosecute. This shouldn't be prosecuted or not at the discretion of a biased partisan. The prosecutor obviously has a conflict of interests that the police officers involved and their departments are closely associated with the office of the DA and their prosecutors. There needs to be an independent prosecutor that has no connections with the criminal justice system, who charges and tries cases of police misconduct. As long as normal prosecutors continue to fulfill this duty, we can never expect justice in these cases.  




 I do. Probable cause is what's necessary for charges and a trial. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is what's necessary for a conviction. 

You've been arguing that there isn't a legal basis for charges in the first place. That's an outright lie. There's probable cause for all of those charges. One of the main reasons we can't expect a conviction, is because people like you would prefer there be no trial to begin with.  




 And there's no bias here. I haven't stated any preference to charges, just an opinion that there are no charges that I forsee sticking in this case.


That's funny because Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide, and dereliction of duty. But what would he know? He's only a judge. You're not biased at all are you?
