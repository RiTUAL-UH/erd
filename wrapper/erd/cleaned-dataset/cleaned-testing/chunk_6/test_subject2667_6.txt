 They are an opinion site, not a news site.  




 Everyone says that, but they are usually people who disagree with its politics.  




 The characters are fictional anyway, why do they "have" to stick to that?  




 Downvote and move along, then. /r/politics mods hate Alternet.  




 So what, we went to Iraq and let their government live?  




 I was going to watch, but then I saw /u/dicklordmcfaggotson's comment, and everyone knows he's always right.  




 Clearly they don't want government buildings to be near any future protests.  









 Sauce? 




 Truth hurts, huh?  














 If they are devoted to their religion and male, they likely are.  




 [You could not be more wrong.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html) 




 In Urban areas, racial diversity is normal, so it is a lot less common. That doesn't mean it never happens, but you'll have more people jumping to your defense.  




 The military doesn't realize that serving in a country's military is a big part of Sikh culture, and that the soldier will be extremely professional.  




 Even if he was a Muslim it wouldn't be okay.  









  Muslims are allowed to eat meat from Christians and Jews. 

Sorry, this isn't agreed upon by all Muslims. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah 




 Fun fact: Chilean Sea Bass isn't really ["sea bass."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_toothfish) 




 Uhh, you forgot Mickie James. Maryse wasn't bad either.   




 Not Arab, but Muslim. I stick to seafood or vegetarian if meat isn't halal.  




 Do you ever get fish?  









 I take it this is for stoppage time?  




 YES, YOU CAN, GET A FLAIR LIKE I HAVE 




 HEY, DO WHAT I DO OR FIND SOME VINTAGE CREST 




 TWO OF DC'S STARTERS WERE HURT YESTERDAY. 




 DORITOS 




 Look at this hipster following the AFC Champions League. /s 




 Does the group plead the FIF?

1,2,3,4, FIF! 




 Their pro-rel is kind of a joke. Rich teams that were relegated were buying the licenses of promoted teams so they could stay up.  




 Ok feud with CM Punk that had Punk creepily singing happy birthday to Rey's adorable daughter.  




 He should've gotten a retirement match or sendoff, though.  




 Where did Styles go?  




  Mysterio vs. Fenix and Mysterio vs. Drago
 

Mysterio vs. Johnny Mundo (Morrison)! A match we never got in WWE (at least not that I remember) that would be amazing.  




 You think Gaddis is better? Maybe defensively, but I don't think you remember the Williams from a couple of years ago.  




 Well, we'll see if RBNY can win any playoff competition anytime soon.  




 Wow, good that he's doing that again! When healthy, he really helps the offense and is one of the top RBs in the league.  




 What are those, comment flairs for ants? They should be like, five times bigger.  




 Who made the cross? Well aimed.  




 Except when the CCL rolls around (at least until an MLS team wins it).  




 For those of you who don't get it, he's talking about the Brooklyn Italians. 




 Not according to the UN and most of international community.  




 How much time do you have? Zack Ryder. Christian. Cesaro. Big E. Kofi Kingston. Titus O'Neill. Tyson Kidd. Sin Cara. Every diva who can wrestle and act convincingly.  




 Uh oh, that sounds like union talk! Better get the scabs!  




 Username is great here.  









 I agree completely. It's why I don't have an MLS team yet. I've never lived anywhere with one, and don't identify with the team closest to my hometown (in MD, close to Baltimore, but the closest MLS team is Philly). 














 There are like eight teams in London though! And Fulham has a reputation for signing Americans, and now has an American owner. 




 Grammar is usually worse when people type from their phones. I have to know correct grammar for my job. I don't correct people, but when you try to call people out for it (even if it is sarcastic), I HAD to do it.  




 Didn't capitalize Man or I, spotlight is one word, grammar is spelled with two A's, shorthand is usually one word.  




 How do I become clear?  









 Who is yersel and why should I be thinking for him? 




 Salaam my Arab brother! Christian? Atheist? Jewish? 




 "You Winchesters are idjits!" 




 Whoever was downvoting this earlier is stupid. That's how you respond to "takbir," for one, so it's not unexpected. Second, every Muslim says Allahu Akbar, not just extremists.  




 But then you'd be rooting for financial groups, mate. 









 OP is whining.  




 Yeah, I think he slipped in that joke.  




 It's been there for eight hours. It's also on /r/videos. 




 Hence why he said "worse-kept secret." 




  Felix Magath's farther 

I take it his closer was German?  




 On  a related note, here's this: http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/17/its-hard-to-prove-any-hate-crime-but-for-muslim-victims-its-especially-tough/?hpid=z10 




 Your posterior had better contact someone at once! 




 Hey Garber and the players' union, are you listening? The mental health of these people is at stake! 




 [The FBI thinks there's enough evidence to open an investigation of their own, and have seized the man's computer, a camera and three phones.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/us/fbi-inquiry-muslim-student-killings-chapel-hill-north-carolina.html) 




 Terrorism knows no race or religion.  




 Why can't Muslims be rogue idiots with mental problems? Are they always part of a greater movement?  




 In America and England, those are areas of crime, not "Shariah zones" or some BS.  




 Biden's son Beau served overseas, even though he was Attorney General of Delaware at the time.  




 Neither was a hate crime? Yeah, ok. Who says atheists can't be right wing, anyway? We don't know (**EDIT: changed from now) about his political views. 

And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations. 

We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism. As Chris Christie put it, "I'm tired of dealing with the crazies."  




 American Muslims have a rational fear of right wing bigotry and terrorism, like what we just saw in Chapel Hill and Houston. A fear of Muslims and Islam is irrational.  









 You just made some Cosmos official's day. 









 Yes, I think that's how it works. 









 DC's is, or so I've heard. 




 U-20s I believe, and he played in competitive matches.  














 The few that have (I'm talking like three or four) probably have come back to the U.S.  




 That was confirmed actually. He's with Uruguay now.  




 As long as it isn't pay to play. Kids with rich parents in the suburbs won't benefit from this as much as talented kids from the other side of the tracks who can't afford the expensive club teams. 














 Hopefully Ventura Alvarado and Cesar Romero.  




 Someone RES tag him! 




 The Hansel of the US soccer pyramid.

 I'm picturing two four-year-olds arguing about this and it's adorable.  




 [CONCACAF Champions League.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Champions_League) 




 Yeah same with me. 




 I saw one chilling at my hotel in Texas a few years ago.  




 You should use "In Latvia no potato, only pain." 




 He sounds like a keeper. 




 I don't know. Is Bork sensitive about his girl pop love? 




 Bork seems to be into a lot of girl pop for some reason.  




 BORK CAME IN LIKE WREAKING BALLLLLLLLL 




 In the preseason so far, Edu is playing D-Mid, with the Portuguese-Canadian guy on loan and Ethan White holding down the CB spots.  




 **Submission Statement**

The Detroit man who was fortunate enough to get donations after his story of walking 20 miles a day to work went viral now has a host of problems to deal with, as he appears to be wealthy in his impoverished neighborhood and now wears a metaphorical target on  his back.  









 I'm not even a fan of Indy Eleven and I want it.  









 Yeah, I read about it in that article by Brian Sciaretta the other week. Sure, the Armenian league isn't all that great, but if Ibarra can get called up, Romero should too. Mexico also has to be noticing his play at this point as media attention increases.  




 Cesar Romero is running away with the Armenian league golden boot. He needs to get called up too.  




 It was good news for Americans, who make up a majority of this subreddit. It also was the catalyst for the creation of MLS.  




 When the '94 World Cup was announced?  




 So, anybody want an older Rapids jersey. It's 2XL and has been sitting in my closet for a while. I bought it from Ross and it still has the tags. I've been too lazy to post to /r/kitswap (I'll do it eventually). Does anyone here want to save me the trouble?  




 He's a Twellman-Holden hybrid.  




 That's what supporters of Bashar say too.  




 You were hoping he had relations with a corpse?  




 Woo woo woo, you know it! 









 And that's why you're an NYC fan.  




 It's a play on grassroots. Grassroots means an effort that began organically, from the ground up. Astroturf is fake grass, so astroturfing is a fake version of grassroots. 
 




 I'm referring to the previous "reform" candidate Mohammed bin Hammam, who has since been banned from FIFA.  









 Government propaganda can be hazardous to one's mental health.  




 What about that Mecca-Madinah railway?  




 Only in that it is one year afterward... 




 Why are all the reform candidates members of Arab royal families?  




 Autocorrect has ruined me. 




 I always thought a good gimmick would for someone to buy into his philosophy, start Bo-lieving and then suddenly win their matches with Bo's help. Someone like Zack Ryder would be perfect. He could wear a white suit, have a combed haircut and start spouting off how terrible he was before he met Bo and started bolieving. They could do that victory lap holding each other's arms high. 

**EDIT:** Suit not suite. He can't wear a nice hotel room. It's also spelled "bo-lieve."

 It's sad that you only see those two options. Tunisia seems to be doing well.

 OK, Jerry. 




 HATERS GONNA HATE HATE HATE

BORK SHAKE IT OFF 




 Hur durr they're Arab cuz they wear turbans. OP is a   




 I'll talk shit on any unelected king, bro, when they make the news. I have issues with leaders who aren't accountable.  




 You have Arab immigrants too, don't forget them! 




 In your case, probably Israels.  




 He's an unelected king with near-absolute control. I think that's why he's being denigrated.

 









 On a related note, what happened to Conor Doyle? He got minutes a couple of seasons ago but rode the pine last year.  




 entire political party bigoted is very much a personal attack

I fail to see the logic in this. 

 




 He's a mod for /r/PalsbaraInAction, so JIDF probably isn't far off. **EDIT**:Just checked, he isn't and I got him confused with another user. Still posts too much though.  




 Then hummus is biddah, because the clearly the chickpeas are taken from the plant, mashed, and deliciously flavored... 




 /r/im14andthisisfunny 









 They certainly are, but I'm not less of an American for disagreeing with them.  




 How much of it is him and not being egged on by the producers?  




  If you don't like democracy, YOU can be the one to GTFO. 

Thankfully, there's a first amendment that protects people regardless of their political opinions.  




 /u/sematrix is a bit prejudiced against Jews and Judaism. He posts ok stuff, but discredits those of us who criticize Israel because we are opposed to injustice, not because we don't like Jews or Judaism.  




 I like the post, but I don't like semantics or the poster...oh right, sematrix.  




 I think they're setting up a face Orton - heel Rollins matchup at Wrestlemania, hence the Orton bashing.  




 I'll give you Putin and their laws, but supporting Russia and Russian culture does not make someone a heel, it just makes them proud of their country. Making someone pledge allegiance to another country against their will is a heel move.  



















 Are we sure if this is satire or not? 




 Oh, I wasn't referring to 2003. Back then, Syria was internally ok, relatively speaking.  




 You forgot Bahrain, which brutally crushed its own Arab Spring (all but dead unless you live in Tunisia) uprising.  




 Plenty of Syria refugees are in Jordan as well.  




 Replace the mentions of trolling in the article with harassment, and it's still a good article.  




 Yeah, I noticed that too, hence my comment. 




 /u/Ingens_Testibus's post or mine?  




 Something tells me there is hair on your neck and a fedora on your head.  




 Emegharad! DP! 




 Does that make [Juan Cena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wKClxSRsg0) El Generico?  




 You mean people can't see him?  




 He must not know much about Intercourse.  




 Up here, /u/mattnox, up here.  




 It was temporary, and I'm back. Terrorism is wrong, everybody, even when it's to advance the game of soccer.  




 Still cringeworthy sometimes. "They wants me to be a good R-Truth!" 




 Should've given him Paul Heyman as a mouthpiece. 




 He forgot all of the Germericans.  




 The more money we come across the more problems we see... 




 YOU MUST BE NEW HERE.  




 Squeeze your nose for a few seconds and then let go. You'll instantly smell the inside of your nose. I'm serious, try it. Usually it's something you recently ate.  




 If terrorists attacked an MLS game it would instantly become the most popular sport in America. 


Ok, I just had an evil thought and should probably take a break from Reddit for a while.  




 You sons of a silly person! 




 And what is your team, unflaired one?  




 He's a returning MLS player, though, so aside from the USMNT he still goes through allocation.  




 I guess everyone's ditching the existing USL Pro teams and making their own? Seems like the Kickers and others are chopped liver.  




 Turmeric, red pepper, and a beaten egg. It tastes very good.  




 He was there when he was called up, and in all honesty he's not likely to be sticking around. 









 Nobody with national team caps should sign with an NASL team, at least not for a while. Freddy is better than that.  




 You're getting Freddy Adu and you will like it!  




 As noted earlier, it would take a DP spot to do that.  




 Crazy, isn't it? I never believed the rumors, as I don't even think he looks that old.  




 I would think so. Although, so many teams would pass on him that it may render the process irrelevant.  




 Freddy Adu?  




 You can't forget tipping the fedora.  




 Also, look at working at the sports department of a mid-sized or small newspaper. Resume building can help out when another media outlet has a soccer reporter opening. Sure, you'll have to cover other stuff, but you'll get experience.  




 You do realize having him last until the final four IS booking him differently, right? Careers can be made out of nowhere with a good rumble showing.  




 I'm a journalist, but not a sports journalist. That being said, freelance and look for a job at the same time. If anything, you'll be building up credibility to help you find a soccer journalism job. 

In the meantime, do a ton of online searching. MLSSoccer.com, journalismjobs.com and even just plain Google will work.  









 You're right and shouldn't be downvoted. There's never been a foreign face WWE champion and I think that's why.  




 Yeah, you're being the bigger man here.  




 He had better options in the fall, with Werder Bremen and apparently some  Eredivisie teams interested. Heck, if he stayed with Utrecht, he'd be playing with Rubin right now, which would be a sick combination.
