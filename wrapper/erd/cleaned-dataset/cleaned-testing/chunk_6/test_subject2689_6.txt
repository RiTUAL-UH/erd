 I have never seen that happen before. Ever.

That said, yes, I agree: unless the story has to do with digital stalking, then one should use a real name. 




 I'm sorry about your lost history. That really sucks.

At the bottom of posts, there's a set of links. If you click **save**, you'll, well, save a link to that story. It'll appear under the "Saved" tab on your user page. Maybe try that when you like a story? At least there's no risk of it being erased. 




 That's actually adorable. I mean it. 




  It's bound to happen.

And the people were **bound** when it was happening, too. ;D 




 I will neither confirm nor deny this statement... 




 I'm sure some stories are real---all the more reason to act like everything is real and offer your help.

(Unless they're asking for tips on where to hide the body...) 




 Alternate universes are actually OK now, as long as the story comes back into the 'real' world, so to speak.

Could also just be that the mods weren't made aware.

I also recently learned that stories with 5 or more reports *automatically* get removed, sans-mod intervention. That may or may not have happened to the story you're defending. I don't know: I'm not a mod. All I know is that these guys do great work, and the OOC needs more cheer in it. 




  Because we all love that author, great. Then another similar story but actually -- more realistic -- gets taken out.

It's not about whether the author is popular or not. I've had a couple stories removed by the mods, even though I've had plenty of popular ones. It's really not a question of favoritism: it's a question of man-(or lady)-power.

(There was a sticky about a month ago requesting applications to join the mod team, by the way.)

I understand that you're frustrated, but you're coming off as combative, whether or not that's your intention. People will be much more willing to discuss the issue if it's a chill and toned-down conversation.
 




 The mods don't get paid for all the work they put into this sub. It's a labor of love, and no one loves NoSleep more than its mods.

Hating on the mods for enforcing the rules is like turning on a volunteer firefighter for taking care of your neighbor's home before yours because it's not as structurally-sound or something. They do what they can. There are thousands of stories posted every day. The mods have jobs and/or kids. Just because some stories get caught and others don't doesn't mean it's OK to disobey the rules. For every drunk driver pulled over by the police, hundreds go by unnoticed. Does that mean driving drunk is OK? Nope...but there are only so many police officers around to catch them. 




 Hello my fellow Canadork! :D

 Can't disappoint a gutted deer. It'd be bad for business. 




 Maybe none of us are authors. Maybe we're all just REALLY unlucky people who have had a ton of supernatural stuff happen to us...and, uh, maybe our ages and genders change constantly (for supernatural reasons?) You can't know for sure!

You're provided with a slew of wonderful horror stories, free of charge, in exchange for one itty bitty [link](https://www.facebook.com/manen.lyset) that you don't even have to click. 




 Hey, don't put yourself down like that. You're a couple of reasonably-sized birds in a human suit. 




 He didn't say he didn't enjoy the story. He said he hadn't read it. 




 Oh, you pesky pile of 26 corgies in a trench coat! :P 




 I equate it to telling scary stories around a campfire. Yeah, everyone knows they're fake and some people even try to correct you mid-story, but that doesn't keep people from telling them and enjoying them. If you don't like the comments, then don't read the comments. 




 It was supposed to be just an ordinary Tuesday, but then I realized yesterday was Fridaydun dun duuuuun. 




 Did you know that you go blind for an average of 40 minutes a day? Im not talking about when you close your eyes to sleep or when you blink. It happens for a millisecond whenever your eyeballs move: your brain stops registering visual data to prevent you from seeing the world as a blurry mess. It happens so quickly that its impossible for you to perceive the lapse, just like when you look at a frame-by-frame animation. Everything seems like one fluid image, but the truth is, youre seeing snapshots. They call it *saccadic masking*. Your eyes capture data, but your mind discards portions of it for a more stable viewing experience. The fact of the matter is that your brain lies to you on a regular basis, and only shows you what it wants you to see. If your brain can ignore what your eyes see, then you have to ask yourself what else it might be keeping from you. I found out the horrifying truth when I went in for my laser eye surgery.

Ive had to wear glasses since I was in grade school, back when calling someone four-eyes was the cool thing to do. I got teased a lot, especially after my lenses got so thick that my eyes seemed huge to anyone looking. Now, most kids could get away with only wearing their glasses when their parents were around. They'd remove them as soon as the authority figures were out of sight, so they wouldn't get teased. I couldn't, because I was drastically near-sighted, and *needed* my glasses to function. It wasnt until my later years in high school that I started wearing contact lenses. I was a little squeamish at first, because shoving ones finger in ones eye isnt exactly a pleasant experience. That said, it was better than constantly having to adjust and clean my glasses. I used to go through a bottle of spray per week. In the winter, it was practically impossible to walk around outside, what with the fog build-up. Contact lenses made everything better.

For a while, the lenses were enough, and I enjoyed the freedom they offered me. I cant tell you how depressed I was the day my optometrist told me that Id undoubtedly need to get glasses within the next two years to keep up with my degenerative myopia. They didnt make contact lenses strong enough for me. This was around the time that laser eye surgery was starting to take off, but it was so expensive that I didnt even consider getting it done. Before long, I was wearing a combination of glasses and contact lenses just so I could function.

Years passed, and laser eye surgery became more popular, effective, and less expensive. I graduated college, got a full-time job at the government, and eventually earned insurance coverage. My annual eye exam being weeks away, I decided to take a look at my insurance plan. I knew I was going to need a new pair of glasses, since things were getting blurry again, so I wanted to know how much Id have to spend out of pocket. Lo and behold, I spotted a clause stating 70% of laser eye surgery fees were covered. I was floored, and immediately set up an appointment at a local clinic. One thing led to another, and I got booked for surgery.

The set-up for the procedure itself terrified me beyond words. I was in a dark room, strapped down to a chair while an ominous machine hung over my head, quietly humming as though heralding my doom. My eyelids were forced open using medical tape, as though I were in a dystopian sci-fi mind-control chamber. Im not going to lie: a big part of me wanted to run away screamingbut then, Id have to pay the 50$ cancellation fee, and that just wasnt happening.

The eye surgeon squeezed a few numbing droplets into my eyes. The prickling sensation made me want to blink away the liquid, but the tape kept my eyelids in place despite my efforts. Whoever decided the procedure needed to be done while conscious must have had quite the sadistic streak. I felt my throat tightening as a scalpel approached my right eye. The surgeons hand had just the slightest tremor, and I could picture him turning my eye into a shish kabob. I wanted to run and scream and crawl back into my mothers womb. *No more glasses, no more glasses, no more glasses* I repeated to myself, hoping the mantra would give me enough courage to see things through. My instincts were telling me to close my eyes and look away, yet it was physically impossible to do so. I had to watch as the sharp knife carefully touched the surface of my eyeball. The surgeon sliced a flap of my cornea and delicately folded it over. As he did so, half of my field of vision went dark. The first eye was bad enough, but the procedure was all the more terrifying when the surgeon started on my left eye, because I knew what was coming. The pain wasnt nearly as bad as the anxiety building in me as the scalpel neared me once again. Another quick cut, and I was effectively blind.

At first, all I could see was darkness and morphing grey shapes like when you close your eyes. But then, a small red dot emerged in the distance. The surgeon said it was the laser, and told me to focus on it. I locked my warped gaze onto the light, but when something appeared in my peripheral vision, I found it hard to keep from straying. I shouldnt have been able to see anything but that red light, yet a shape swirled around just out of sight. When I mentioned it to the surgeon, he dismissed it as my brain playing tricks on me. While the laser did its thing, I continued to see an outline in the corner of the room. It couldnt have been the surgeon, since he was busy operating the laser. Once the procedure was done, I was told to keep my eyes closed for the rest of the day, and sent home to recover.

The next day, I woke up and saw the world in a completely new light. It was like upgrading from a black and white tv to a high-end HD flatscreen. For the first time in my life, I could see clearly with my own two eyes. I could see the tiny rocks on the ceiling, the grain on my wooden cabinet, the pores on my skin, the sagging old man hovering in the corner, the flowers in the hall, the- *HOLY SHIT!* There was an old man hovering in the corner of my room. He bobbed up and down, looking at me absent-mindedly and grinning in a creepily perverse manner. His flat yellow fork-like teeth protruded from his mouth as his three beady eyes looked me over, sparkling like demonic stars in the sky. I knew that Id seen him before. Part of me knew that Id been seeing him my entire life. My brain pretended he wasnt there, but my eyes saw him nonetheless.

As I backed out of the room, the monstrous man clapped his bony hands together in amusement, following me into the hall. The memory of a reoccurring childhood nightmare came flooding into my mind: I was in the woods, running away from the three-eyed man. Whenever he was about to catch me, Id always make it out of the forest just in time to escape, only to find the ground cave beneath me give, sending me falling down a ravine. Id wake up screaming for my parents, who comforted me and told me it was just a bad dream. Yet there I was, face to face with my own personal boogieman. Though in my memories, he was always frowning, the cruel smile plastered on his face made me realize that he knew I could see him now. He knew he could chase me, just like in my nightmares.

I ran. I ran out of my home and into the street, still in my pyjamas. The sunlight stung my sensitive eyes, but the pain was nothing compared to the fear I felt. I didnt even have time to take in the undoubtedly gorgeous view, because something else caught my eye.

They were everywhere. Boogiemen, monsters, ghostswhat ever you want to call them. Your brain wants to protect you from the truth, but the visual data is stored in your mind. The images come out when you sleep, because thats when your brain loses control and can no longer restrain the memories. Sometimes, when the conditions are *just* right, people can catch passing glimpses of them, like a glitch in a videogame. In reality, theyre always around. You cant run from them. Believe me, Ive tried. If you see them, act as though you cant. They enjoy the chase. Dont give them the satisfaction. Your rational brain will lie to you, but your instincts wont. Trust your gut: if you feel like youre being watched, its because you are.

It took the three-eyed man less than two days to catch me. In that time, I saw more nightmarish creatures than you could possibly imagine. I saw headless men, horrid hags, elongated people, and most frightening of all, creatures that looked identical to my loved ones. They stood motionless a few meters away from me, heads down as they continuously whispered my name. I saw the world for what it was, and it terrified me. In a way, what the three-eyed man did when he caught me was almost a relief. At least Ill never have to look at those horrific creatures again. And, hey, I'll never need glasses or contact lenses ever again. 




 Thank you for this, Gravy! 




 Please hold me? : ( 




 This is freakier than Ocarina of Time's Forest Temple theme---and that's saying A LOT. 




 I'd say just jump right in. If it doesn't work out, try to figure out why so you can learn from your mistakes. If it works out, then rejoice!

I'd also recommend giving a listen to a few episodes of The NoSleep Podcast before you start. The soothing and creepy music/narration combo will put you in the mood.

 




 It's better than anything I could ever do, that's for sure. If I were the narrator, you'd be hearing "Uuhhh"s "Ummmm"s, and a ton of stuttering all over the place. Guess I never got the public speaking gene.

Or the math gene.

*Sobs, quietly rocking in the corner.* A-at least I can write. W-who cares if I can't figure out tips without using a calculator. 




 I enjoyed it. Good voice, good volume, good pacing.

It does seem like the last couple of lines were glued too closely together and overlap, but that might be for effect.

Either way, keep with it. Narrations are wonderful, and there can never be too many of them out there! 




 And free wifi! 




 Let's make a list for authors who can't make it on the other lists. 




 Who else manages that page, by the way? It said to contact the poster to get in, but I PMed a few months ago and nothing. Should I just ask any 'ol mod? 




 I tolerate him despite his faults. 




 Rodriguez is just the BEST advertising guru ever! 




 If you're going to talk about yourself in the third person, do it with style. 

I.e. "Please support the wonderful man-beast who authored this piece of work, for he is as magnificent as the final rays of sunlight on the last day of summer."

I look forward to reading it, good sir.

(P.S. Never listen to Manen's advice. Though he is a specimen of untold greatness and boundless wisdom, he is also somewhat detached from normality.) 




 Please, support the Author by leaving an honest review. Thanks!

So, you're posting this on behalf of the writer, or you're the writer and talking in the third person..? I'm not trying to be nit-picky, I'm just genuinely wondering. Either way, I have a 3-hour plane ride to take this week, so I'll download it and give it a read. 




 A long day of driving turned into an even longer night. This time, my parents weren't stopping for anything more than a few quick pit stops. They alternated between sleeping and driving, leaving us to entertain ourselves in the back seat. They barely even acknowledged us anymore. The night stretched out for what felt like an eternity. I was feeling homesick, which was an odd sensation for someone who had never really had a "home" to begin with.


It must have been around 5 in the morning when I woke up and peeked between the front seats. From the windshield, I could see the sunrise in the distance. Dad was snoring in the passenger seat and mom was driving. She looked exhausted, barely clinging to consciousness. Her head kept dipping and jerking back up every so often, causing the car to swerve lightly.


The sound of radio static filled the air, causing the hairs at the back of my neck to lift like a porcupine's spikes. I turned my gaze to the window on my right: it was like watching snow on the TV. My head quickly snapped to the left, only to find the same blurred image had replaced the world around me. I could see the outlines of Miguel's mask slowly meld together from the white and black pixels covering the window closest to me. The white pixels glued together to form his face, and the black pixels congregated into his uneven dark eyes. I swallowed hard as a sensation of fear turned my body into ice. No one could protect me now. Not my mom, not my dad, not my sister, and *probably* not Mr. Scuzzypants, my sister's stuffed animal.

Miguel's hand stretched out from the window and reached towards me. 




 I never downvote a story. If it breaks the rules, I'll report it. If it doesn't appeal to me, then I say nothing and move on.

I'll upvote a story only if I really enjoyed it. Good writing, interesting plot, no mention of pool floaties, and a general sense that the writer actually...y'know, cared. 




 That's called a interrogangbang. I'm coining it. 




 This is going to be awesome! 




 Ooooh. That looks lovely! 




 I don't get this. You're coming to NoSleep, a sub for stories (and, therefore, a sub for reading), but don't want to read longer stories? That's like going to a fast food place and then complaining about the lack of healthy food options.

Whether you read two 1 500-word stories or one 3 000-word story, you're going to be reading the same amount of words.

If it's because you have a short bus ride and don't want to stop mid-story, then maybe stick to /r/shortscarystories/ (275 words or less per story) while you're riding, and NoSleep once you get home and have more time? 




 I think that was a good call. Thank you and the other mods for reconsidering your stance on this. 




 I've had so many weird things happen to me, ranging from slightly bizarre to flat-out seeing a person in my house (who I thought was a burglar) when there was no one there. The *strangest* thing; however, happened one winter when I was in high school.


I'd gone skating with my friend that evening and we were walking back to my place. There was this little path behind an outdoor mall near my place that brought you into the residential area. You basically had the parking lot, a fence, and then the path with a few trees on the left and a forest on the right.


As we were walking, I commented on how unusually black the sky looked (because I use to say weird but accurate things like that all the time...I was a little weird back then). Suddenly, WHOOOOOOOOSH! The strongest freaking gust of wind out of NOWHERE. I mean, it wasn't even windy that night. It dislodged the biggest icicle I've ever seen in my life from one of the trees about 100 meters ahead of us. People get seriously injured by ice falling off the sides of buildings in my city, so believe me when I say that ice can be pretty freaking dangerous. That thing could have turned us into ice-kabobs.


The shard came flying straight towards my friend and I. She screamed and grabbed me tightly, hiding her face against my arm. My reaction was just to stare at it. It all happened so quickly, so it's not like it would have been possible to dodge the thing as it made a beeline towards us. Then, when it got within about 1 meter (roughly 3.5 feet) from us. I swear it DEFLECTED. It was like it hit something and turned suddenly 90 degrees to the right, jabbing into the snow next to us instead.


I spent the rest of the year thinking I had magic shield powers or something. Hahaha, I had a bit of an over-active imagination back then. Still, to this day, I have absolutely no idea how the ARROW OF DEATH changed course so drastically. My best guess is that an opposing gust of wind shot it away, but I don't remember feeling the wind change direction, and that's lucky as heck, considering the thing was just about ready to impale my sorry ass. Really, half a second later, and I was going to have a huge icicle through the chest. 




 Alternate dimensions are in? YESSSSSS!!! I had a story that was walking a very narrow line and wasn't sure it'd be acceptable. Maybe I can write it now.

Overall, I think these are some great changes. From a writer's point of view, the 1000 word minimum is fine. From a reader's point of view, I'm not crazy about it. I've read some wonderful fairly short stories on NoSleep that were too big for Super Short Scary Stories. Now, they're going to be lost to the world.

...but we're getting alternate dimensions, so...HUZZAH! 




 'The' is the best team name EVER. 




 Team 1 - **Team Grumpy Murder Sharks**

Title - **For most of my childhood, my family was on the run, and I didn't even know it**

Between 1989 and 1998, my family moved over twenty times. About twice a year, wed get completely uprooted and have to start our lives over in a new city. My sister and I thought nothing of it, since we were army brats and relocating had become second nature to us. Every morning, our parents would change into their military uniforms, drop us off at school, and drive away in our rusty old clunker of a car. What my sister and I didn't know was that our parents had gotten discharged in 1991. We weren't moving because they were being reassigned: we were running.

It was summer of 1998, and wed been living in the same dingy apartment for seven months. My parents were getting a little stir-crazy waiting for their new assignments. This was the first time wed stayed in one place for so long, and I started believing wed finally found a permanent home. Maybe Id be able to make friends and actually keep them for once. Though the mood at home was tense, what with my parents constantly whispering between themselves, my social life was booming. I was being invited to birthday parties, went to sleepovers, and even signed up for an upcoming school trip. Things could not have been any better, until the night I went to the park alone.

That evening, my parents were entertaining an old woman with a floral shawl covering her head. They didn't even notice me sneaking out the door. I made my way down the apartment complex, crossed the street, and walked into the park. On an old chain swing stood a man who seemed normal from the neck-down: he wore a bright blue scarf, a black t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and running shoes. Things got a little weird from the neck-up: he had on a white mask that almost seemed to glow in the dimming twilight. His dirty blond hair fell over the solid curved edge lining his forehead. The mask was smooth and plain. The only details on it were the small holes where his nose should have been, a large black void for a right eye, and a smaller hole for a left eye. 




 Prepare to be Grumpy Murder Sharked! 




 TEAM 1 FOREVEEEEER!

According to my beautiful team name generator, we are henceforth known as: **Team Grumpy Murder Sharks**. 




 I think there's a difference between "Hun" and "Hon", and both are valid. Different regions spell and pronounce it differently.

When I see someone use "Hun" in a story, it's often because the characters are southern. 




 Wonderful idea. The manonator is all in! 




 I-I want to shove my face against his belly and hug him forever. ;_; 




 As a completely impartial third-party who has nothing to do with this ebook whatsoever and definitely isn't one of the writers featured in it, I must say, The Nightmare Collective cured my chronic case of 'sleep'. I used to waste a good 7 hours a night on 'sleep', and that was a damn shame. After reading this horror story compilation, 'sleep' isn't a problem any more.

If any of you are plagued with the same ailment, I would highly recommend picking this up. If not, then I would *still* recommend picking it up, because:

1. It's currently free.

2. It'll give you something to do while you're enjoying conciousness at its fullest.

3. I heard a rumor that the writers will perform a sexy belly dance routine for you personally if you show them proof that you own a copy.


*Edited for formatting. 




 Yup, that Kaylee was definitely housewife/mommy material. I can only imagine what she did to the girls she didn't like in school. 




 I woke up this morning to the sound of giggling coming from the living room.

"Crap." I grumbled.

"Mmm..?" groaned Clara.

"We forgot to set the alarm." I said, looking at the bag of Easter chocolates in the corner. We still needed to set up the egg hunt.

Clara rolled over and mumbled, "We'll tell the kids the Easter bunny got held up. Busy racing a turtle or something."

Someone had to do damage control, and I could tell Clara wasn't going to get out of bed any time soon. I tried going in for a kiss, but when I saw dried saliva crusted around Clara's mouth, I changed my mind. Besides, she was already snoring by the time my face reached hers. Sighing, I left my cozy blanket, and reached for yesterday's jeans, which were lying unceremoniously in a pile of dirty clothes next to my bed. As I stuck my legs clumsily through the openings, I noticed the clock: 3.16 a.m. My kids were NEVER up that early, even on Easter.

I turned to my wife. "Babe, you're the best," I said, in a mock-feminine voice, "thanks for taking care of it, you sexy thing."

Okay, I might have been a *little* irked at her.

As I was about to exit the room, I heard a sound outside my door. At first, I thought it was David's padded Cookie Monster slippers, but the taps were followed by a clicking sound not unlike that of a dogs nails hitting the linoleum floor. I hoped the kids hadn't let the neighbors flee-infested mutt inside again. I'd deduct half their Easter chocolate if that was the case. I knelt down, and peered under the door to try and confirm my suspicions without letting the dog in. Flees in the bedroom? No thanks. What I saw made me do a double-take, which resulted in my slapping my cheek against the floor. It was no dog, that's for sure. The animal had elongated black feet half covered in black patchy fur, half in blistering dark skin. On the edge of its bony toes were long claws clicking against the ground.

"What the fuck is that..?" I said.

My words carried through the paper-thin walls and startled the creature. It hopped out of sight, and I could hear it tap tap tapping all the way down the hall. Meanwhile, the turbo-engine snores continued behind me, unperturbed. I sat on my rump in stunned silence, wondering what kind of mangy animal had found its way into my home, and *how* it had managed to do so in the first place. Judging by the size of its feet, it couldn't have made it through the cats door, unless it was a raccoon: those jerks could get in anywhere. I was trying to come up with a plan of attack when I heard the kids giggling again. A pang of panic zapped through me like one of those prank handshake buzzers. The kids weren't safely tucked away in their beds: they were out there with god knows what filthy beast had snuck inside. I grabbed the bat my wife kept on her side of the bed, and dashed out of my room.

A warm and wet substance was waiting for me on the other side of the door, which I only noticed after stepping in it. Cringing, I looked down, hoping it wasn't another fur ball. The floor was covered in a thick brownish liquid, and my first thought was *blood*. I could see it leading all the way down the hallway. Either it belonged to the creature, or one of my kids was bleeding profusely. Both options terrified me, especially since wounded creatures tend to be more violent. I prayed David and Becky were all right. Side-stepping the streaky liquid, I ran towards the living room.

"Becky? David? Are you okay?" I shouted in an alarmed tone, as I rounded the corner.

It took me a few moments to take in the scene, and I did so in multiple stages. First, I ignored the creature entirely, scanning the kids for any injuries. Next, I tried to figure out if they were in any immediate danger. Say, about to get mauled by a rabid mountain lion or something. Finally, I searched for the animal I had spied from under my bedroom door. The kids seemed fine and happy, nothing was actively moving towards them, and the creature wasoh god. David was sitting on the horrid thing.

The monster loosely resembled a hare, but it was far from an adorable woodland creature. Since it was seated, it was hard to gauge its exact size, but if I were to put a number to it, I'd say it was about 4 and a half feet tall. It emitted a strange and powerful odor, like chocolate laced with vinegar. The scent was so strong it made my eyes water. Its body was grotesquely lean, like a starving animal in the middle of winter. Its fur was patchy, rigid, and looked to be covered in melted chocolate. The substance dripped off at the ends of its twisted whiskers, and seemed to perpetually ooze out of its mouth. Its two buck teeth were rotten and chipped. Its ears looked mangled and were gnarled off at the ends. Its eyes were the worst, though. You know those creepy sugar eyes on Easter chocolates animals? That's exactly what they looked like. Soulless, unblinking, cartoonish eyes.

David was sitting on this thing's lap. He had a big grin on his face, petting along its dishevelled, gooey fur. His fingers made the sound of a slug racing down a slip-and-slide.

"Look daddy! The Easter bunny's here!" said David.

Becky reached a hand to pet the thing's decrepit form, "He's so soft!" she chirped.

Something told me they weren't seeing the grotesque figure for what it truly was. I knew my kids: the sight of a cartoon monster could give them nightmares for weeks. There was no way they'd be so calm if they realized what they were playing with.

"Becky, Davidcome here" I told them as calmly as I could.

"But daddy, were playing with the Easter bunny!" answered my daughter.

I held my hands out to my children, trying my best not to let my growing panic show. I didn't know what the beast would do if it sensed danger, and I didn't want to freak my kids out. The rabbits head turned towards me, but it was impossible to tell what those unfocused eyes were looking at exactly. It wrapped its short arms around my boy in a tight hug. I knew what it was thinking: it had no intention of returning my boy. My fingers tightened around my bat.

"Becky Mathilda Carter, come here this instant." I ordered, my voice stern this time.

My daughter complied, but gave me a bit of a pout. I didn't care: I needed to get her to safety, even if that meant looking like the bad guy. The rabbit hissed in response.

"Go to your room. Don't open the door unless it's me or your mom, okay?" I said.

"But, dad" she protested.

"Becky. NOW." I barked.

Head held down, Becky dragged herself down the hall. I waited while my heart thrashed wildly in my chest, until I heard her bedroom door shut. For a split second, I felt relieved, but then the fear came flooding back when I returned my attention to the Easter bunny. He was still hissing, chocolate syrup slowly drizzling along the top of my son's head.

"David, sportcan you come here?" I asked, hoping he'd be able to squeeze out of the creatures bony arms.

I took a step towards them, and the creature reacted by growling loudly and gripping my son tighter. David started crying. I stopped in my tracks, unsure of what to do. It was a stand-off.

"D-daddy. You're scaring the Easter bunny. He won't give us any candy if you scare him!" pleaded my son, as he continued to be pelted with more and more chocolate.

"Thats not the Easter bunnycome here and we'll talk about it, okay?" I requested, spreading my arms out to my child, "Daddy will give you more candy than Halloween and Easter combined, okay?"

David smiled, and tried to get off the rabbit. The creature went absolutely wild, thrashing its head about in every direction while hissing and growling non-stop. Its thick brown saliva came flooding out of its mouth quicker than before, rapidly enveloping my son. I had to do something, but footsteps behind me caught my attention.

"Daddyis the Easter bunny sick?" asked my daughter, tears in her eyes.

I think she was seeing the same thing I was.

I didn't have time to scold Becky for coming back. In the moment it took for me to turn towards her, the creature managed to full encase my son in a thick veil of melted chocolate. I could hear him gurgling and gagging, as it quickly hardened around him.

"Let go of my kid, you son of a bitch!" I screamed, running towards the creature.

My whole being cried out for an unrestrained act of violence. No one messes with my kids and gets away with it, after all. I reared the baseball bat back, and ran forward to swing at the creature.

As I approached the monster, something strange happened to me. In an instant, all the anger seemed to evaporate from my soul. The sounds of my son gurgling, the creature hissing, and my daughter crying all disappeared. I could hear the chirps of Spring birds and what sounded like a pleasant stream in the distances. In front of me stood a large, soft white bunny with a basket full of eggs. I felt calm and at peace. If it wasn't for the fantastic force of physics known as inertia, I might have fallen victim to the illusion. As luck would have it; however, my action was already being executed, and my swing successfully followed-through, striking the creature square across the head. An unearthly crackle echoed in the living room. My stomach twisted with worry. Hopefully I hadn't hit my son by accident. The next thing I knew, the bunny and its devilish counterpart were gone. In its place was a tall, hollow, and headless chocolate bunny.

David was still encased in a cocoon of chocolate, but I quickly freed him while my daughter sobbed nearby. Thankfully, he was okay. I held him in my arms as though cradling a baby, feeling overwhelmingly grateful that both my children had survived.

Once we had all calmed down, I started cleaning up the mess. In the corner of my living room, I found a pile of crushed chocolate, which I knew was the rabbits head. The thing that really got to me were its eyes. You know how I said they were solid sugar? As much as they crept me out when they were attached to him, they managed to completely horrify me when I found them lying amidst the rubble. I wasn't looking at fake candy eyes anymore: I was looking at appalling, stomach-turning, biologically-accurate round eyeballs, just like the ones in a high school science class.

Now, I can't say for sure whether what I saw was the "real" Easter bunny, or some sort of demon masquerading as him. Either way, I don't think Ill ever eat Easter chocolate againnot now that I know what it's made of.

 You've got it backwards. CreepyCatalog asked if they could republish this story after seeing it on NoSleep. You'll notice my name listed as the author. 




 XDD Thanks! 




 If you have trouble with grammar and spelling, put your story in Word and use spell check. It won't catch everything, but it should get a few of the obvious mistakes, like using lowercase 'i' instead of 'I'. Just make sure you pay close attention, because sometimes spell check can do some weeeird stuff. I.e. changing occupying to copying. It did that to me last week. 




 YOU FOOLED ME! I felt loved, then not, then loved again! Now I don't know what to feel.

I like sci-fi. 




 [My grandma was eaten by a willow tree](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/304yzs/my_grandma_was_eaten_by_a_willow_tree/) 




 Is the butler that's "Right here" holding a knife? If so, runinto his ARMS, because he's back! :D 




 Trust yourself. What ever you doBELIEVE IN YOURSELF. Otherwise, you stop existing. Like Tinkerbell. 




 Maybe this is an elaborate April Fools prank. Maybemaybe Suspense IS the Butler!?! 




 I know. : ( I miss him, too. Do you need a hug? Let's stand united in these difficult times. The Butler would have wanted us to be strong. 




 I, for one, recommend getting yourself a teddy bear by the name of Fuzzy Wuzzy, and holding onto him while you watch said movies.

Just make sure it's not a haunted teddy bear. Otherwise, that totally defeats the purpose. 




 First and foremost, I would like to formally apologize to the families of Rene Jackson, Brandon O'Neil, and Adrien Carter. I did not know them well, but they seemed like very smart young individuals with bright futures ahead of them. What happened was entirely my fault, and I would do anything for the opportunity to go back and make things right. The word "sorry" doesn't even begin to describe how I feel. The guilt is tearing me apart, but I will endure it for the short time I have left in this world. I hope you will find it in your hearts to forgive me, though I will not blame you if you spit on my grave for the rest of your days.

I work as a medical examiner in a county hospital, mostly handling autopsies of John and Jane Does that come in at night. Since I work the late shift, it's not uncommon for me to spend hours alone in the morgue. It can get a little lonely and boring at times. Fortunately, I work at a teaching hospital, where we regularly welcome bright-eyed residents ready to take the medical world by storm. They expect to be hazed by their attending doctors and nurses, but not by someone outside of their inner-circle, which is exactly why they get sent my way. The attendings watch and hide as I scare the unsuspecting doctors-to-be. We typically have a good laugh about it afterwards. No harm done. Last week; however, something went terribly wrong.

I was about to start an examination when Doctor Chang phoned to let me know three new residents were coming my way. He typically gave more notice, but I could manage something despite not having my usual prep time. Three eager residents showed up before I even hung up the phone. They told me Doctor Chang had sent them to retrieve a ring for a grieving widow: a classic excuse to justify a trip to the hospital morgue. I rested one hand against John Doe 901-8A's chest, and waved the trio over with the other. Using the gloved hand that had touched the corpse moments prior, I introduced myself and offered them a handshake. I could see them cringe, but they were too polite to refuse. I stalled Miss Jackson, Mr. O'Neil, and Mr. Carter with chit-chat while their attending doctors got into position. Once I could see the tops of their heads peeking from the hallway, I knew it was time to get the show on the road.

I promised I'd retrieve the missing ring as soon as I finished with John Doe 901-8A's autopsy. Waiting for the students to consider their options, I assembled my tools. I knew one of them was going to offer to help: young doctors are notorious for taking advantage of any opportunity to get their hands dirty and to show off. It was Miss Jackson who did as expected, and proposed they assist me. I played dumb, pretended that I was surprised and very relieved to get their help, and motioned towards the box of latex gloves on the counter. In order to keep the students from getting suspicious, I began with simple and normal requests: handing me my scalpel, removing the corpse's shoes and socks, and filling out part of a mandatory autopsy form. All the while, I performed a Y incision on the mans chest to get to his organs. The fun part happened once I felt the students were sufficiently comfortable with my authority. I was going to convince them theyd be hearing a dead mans final breath.

At first, everything went off as it normally would: I explained that I was going to remove oxygen from John Doe's lungs by pressing on them, and if they listened carefully, they could hear it as it made its way up his throat and out his mouth. I didn't put any pressure on them to do so, mind you. It had to be voluntary: I'm not a monster, after all. To my great delight, they all enthusiastically agreed to listen to the biological phenomenon. Now, normally I had enough time to set up an air nozzle near the corpses head, which I would use to send out a gust of air towards the intended victims. It usually startled the living daylights out of them. This time; however, I didn't have the luxury of properly setting up the prank, so I decided Id go with a cheap "BOO!" jump scare instead. The result would likely be the same.
 
"Come closer.", I requested, pointing to my patients face.

Once the students were in position, I asked Mr. O'Neil to open John Doe's mouth. He hesitantly placed his hands on the wrinkly old man's face, pulling his lower jaw down to reveal a nasty set of rotten black teeth. Mr. Carter gagged at the sight, but the other two kept their cool. I must say, I was impressed by how well they kept their composure throughout the examination. Stifling a laugh, I reached a hand inside the corpse's chest in preparation. The smell emanating from John Does mouth was far from pleasant, but it was nothing I wasn't used to. Now, we were all in place: the residents were crouched down with their faces inches from the mans, and mine was about a foot farther away.

"Okay, listen carefully.", I said calmly, squeezing the exposed lung.

A heavy puff of air unexpectedly escaped the man's blueish lips. It was foggy, like a winters breath. The four of us gasped in shock, inadvertently inhaling the fumes. I could feel the sickeningly moist and cold air fingering its way down my throat and into my lungs, leaving the taste of rotten eggs on my tongue. Wiping my mouth, I retracted and gagged in disgust. The attending doctors laughed and clapped behind the glass separator. They had no idea our little prank had gone awry. The freaked-out students looked nauseous, coughing repeatedly as they turned towards the hallway full of doctors. When they realized they'd been hazed, they calmed down. Not wanting to lose face in front of my colleagues, I regained my composure, forced a chuckle, and claimed Id used dry ice to manage the effect.
 
The doctors and students never suspected a thing, but I knew the truth: wed stolen a dead mans final breath. I nervously finished the autopsy, the disgusting taste lingering in my mouth. Aside from the puff of cold air that had escaped the man's lips, there was nothing out of the ordinary with my patient, yet there was something about him that put me on edge. Unfortunately, my childish actions had already sealed our fates, and things were about to take a drastic turn for the worst.

***

My alarm went off, waking me for the first time in years and leaving me in a momentary daze. Usually, I was up a dozen minutes ahead of time. I sat in bed, running a hand over my sore neck. My throat ached, as though I was coming down with the flu, yet the rest of my body was perfectly fine. Although I had brushed my teeth thoroughly several times since the incident in the morgue, I could still make out the aftertaste of rot in the back of my mouth. The subtle flavor was enough to convince me to use the god-awful mouthwash I'd purchased a few months ago. The powerful, alcohol-imbued liquid stung my mouth, but succeeded in diminishing the unpleasant taste.

I drove to work, picking up a cup of coffee along the way. The unpleasant egg-like taste made drinking it almost unbearable, but I needed the caffeine to wake me up. As the rest of the world prepared for a pleasant evening at home, I had mountains of paperwork and several autopsies to look forward to. The beauty of working the night shift was that I rarely got interrupted when I needed to focus. When I arrived at the morgue, my fellow medical examiner gave me a helpful status update, and left me to my own devices. There was a body waiting for examination in cooling unit 5. According to my colleagues' notes, an invasive autopsy would not be necessary.

I opened the cooler, slid the body out, placed it on a gurney, and brought it under a bright neon light for proper examination. There was an annoying hissing noise in the room, so I turned on the radio, and took a seat on a rolling stool in front of my patient. When you see one corpse, you've seen them all. It's hard to be shocked by what lies inside the body bag. That said, when I saw her frozen and pale face, I felt a slight twinge in my chest. You never expect to see someone you know come across your table. Yet, there she was, the young lady I'd pranked the night before. Her skin had taken on a blue sheen. Bruising around her neck revealed that she'd suffocated. The markings were not indicative of human hands, so I checked her file for an explanation. Apparently, Miss Rene Jackson's scarf had gotten stuck in a rotating door. A group of good Samaritans tried to help, but as they pulled the door, the scarf tightened around her neck. By the time they got the poor woman free, she was gone.

It doesn't matter how long you work in the business, the loss of a life always leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. No, not like the taste of rotten eggs from a homeless man's final breath: a metaphorical bad taste. I certainly felt bad for the young lady, but at that moment, I had no idea her death was my fault. It just seemed like an unfortunate accident. When I slipped her back into her cooling unit for pick-up by the funeral home, I made a conscious effort to erase her from my thoughts, and moved to the next corpse on the list.

Later, as I was filing paperwork, the radio started playing god-awful pop music, so I turned it off to keep my ears from melting. My throat was still quite sore, and no amount of water could moisten the walls of my oesophagus. I was just about to leave and get something to eat when I heard the faint hissing coming from the cooling units. I hoped none of the compressors were going on the fritz again. Last time one of them burnt out, we were forced to pair up bodies in the remaining units. It made me uncomfortable to do so, since it could be seen as a lack of respect for the dead, but the alternative was to let them warm up and rot. If I were a family member, I would much prefer seeing my loved one well-preserved rather than decomposed, even if that meant they were spooning another body for a few hours. I made my way to the cooling units, focusing on the rhythmic sound. It was coming from unit 5. It sounded like a repeated cycle of compression and decompression. I opened the pod, touched a hand to the wall, and confirmed that it was still cold. As long as the refrigeration was still working, I saw no reason to make a fuss. I left a note for maintenance to check it out and took a much overdue lunch break.

The combination of a sore throat and the bad taste in my mouth made it hard for me to eat, so I threw out my lunch after a few bites, and spent the rest of my time off wandering the corridors. Once I returned to the office, I was pleasantly surprised that my note to maintenance was gone, and that the noise had stopped. Maintenance rarely acted so quickly, unless it was an emergency.

It wasn't long before my shift was over, and I was relieved of my duties. By then, the sun was rising and the sky was as pink as the small intestine of a freshly-cut corpse. On my way home, I stopped by the pharmacy to buy cough drops in the hopes that the vile-tasting things would ease my aching throat. I did not even hesitate to pop three in my mouth at once, swallowing the numbing mixture of medicine and saliva for some short-lived relief. When I arrived at my modest town house, I placed my phone on the kitchen counter, and took a seat in the living room to watch TV. My phone began buzzing, but nothing was getting me off that couch. The buzzing persisted for quite some time, but my ability to ignore it was boundless. Very few people knew my number, so it had to be work. There was no way in hell I was answering while off-duty. Before long, I was comfortably nestled under my blanket and ready to doze off.
 
When I awoke, I practically had to gasp to get air into my lungs. My airway felt tight and constricted. I immediately threw a handful of cough drops into my mouth to ease the pain and try to reduce inflammation. I rushed to the shower, enjoying the soothing steamy air for longer than normal, while I waited for the pain to subside. Choosing whether or not to call in sick was particularly difficult: my throat was the only thing causing me grief, and I was almost out of sick days, since Id used most nursing a chronic case of "the Mondays". Not wanting to waste a sick day on actually being ill, I ultimately decided to go to work. On my way out, I checked my messages, and saw that my coworker had discovered one of the cooling unit doors wide open. The units were old, so I wasn't particularly surprised to hear that a latch had malfunctioned.

When I arrived for the shift change, my colleague droned on and on about how the city funeral home had not yet picked up the day's shipment of bodies. I promised Id take care of things. After my coworker left, I took a look at the list of acquisitions. There was a new body waiting for me in cooling unit 8. As I pulled it out, I was confronted with the second fatality of my doing. It was Brandon ONeil, though I barely recognized him. For one familiar face to appear on my table was odd. For a second acquaintance to make it there? It was unheard of. A chill ran down my spine, and I couldnt help wondering what was going on. I had to get to the bottom of itand fast.

***

Brandon ONeil, the med student I had met barely two days ago, lay swollen on the coroner table. His face was puffy and barely recognizable. In fact, I only knew who it was thanks to his medical chart. He was the second casualty in what ended up to be a tragedy entirely of my doing. I examined him thoroughly for any sign of foul-play, suspecting the third med student, Mr. Adrien Carter, was trying to get rid of the competition. There had to be a reason his fellow students had died barely a day apart.

Despite my best efforts to find clues, Mr. O'Neil's autopsy revealed nothing suspicious. The young man died of anaphylactic shock, an allergic reaction that caused his airway to constrict. I found several pieces of ground-up peanuts lodged in his swollen throat. According to his file, he'd been eating at a Thai restaurant and had failed to notice the nuts in his stir fry. Unfortunate? Yes. Preventable? Absolutely. Suspicious? Definitely not. I swallowed hard, the taste of sweaty socks and sulfur still at the forefront of my mouth.
 
Following procedure, I completed Mr. ONeils autopsy, placed the young man back in his cooling unit, and set up to write my report. A familiar sound caught my attention as I sat down to focus. The cooling units were hissing again. This time, I could hear not one, but two distinct sources. What were the odds that two compressors were malfunctioning at the same time? My investigation ended before it even began, when my office phone started ringing. Startled by the sound, I nearly fell off my chair. It was Ted from the funeral home, apologizing about failing to pick-up last night's shipment. The funeral home was backed up and wouldn't be able to come by for another 36 hours. It was certainly not ideal, but it happened from time to time, and I was confident we had enough functioning cooling units to make due.

I went back to work, trying my hardest to ignore the pain in my throat and the sound of the cooling units compressing and decompressing incessantly. Without realizing it, I found myself breathing along to the same tempo. As the sound began to slow, so too did the speed of my breathing. I'm not sure what would have happened, had Doctor Chang not appeared at that moment. I suspect that, had the sound stopped entirely, I might have forgotten to breathe. Thankfully, it didn't come to that, and Chang broke me out of my trance by storming into my office.

A smile on my face, I greeted doctor Chang courteously. He and I had a sort of childish camaraderie, wherein we frequently pulled pranks both together and against one another. His gloom-ridden features told me that his visit was not going to be a pleasant one. He was, as one would expect, quite distraught about the deaths of his two residents. In lieu of comforting him---something I was not particularly adept at, I answered his questions regarding his students, and shared my findings with him. Since the autopsies had revealed nothing suspicious, there wasnt much to tell. Doctor Chang, in turn, confided in me something quite disturbing: the third medical student, Mr. Carter, had not shown up for his shift. Intending to lighten the mood, I assured Doctor Chang that his student was not among the corpses in my morgue. Little did I know, he soon would be.

After Doctor Chang left, I went back to work, updating my dossiers. As I took a stroll towards the filing cabinet near the cooling units, I began hearing that noise again. I immediately called maintenance, claiming there was an emergency. They arrived promptly and performed a thorough inspection. When they approached me, waiting outside in the hallway, they warned me that cooling units 5 and 8 had been opened. They theorized that Id heard the sound of air escaping the capsules. I; however, was certain Id closed the doors properly this time. I began feeling quite nervous as the men left the room. Almost as soon as they were out of sight, the sounds started again. I ran to the cooling units, and pushed against their doors: they were sealed shut. The sounds, I realized, were like that of someone breathing. Were Rene and Brandons bodies somehow breathing inside of the vacuum-sealed chambers? The hairs on the back of my neck and arms rose, and I took a step back. From the corner of my eyes, I saw cooling unit 5s door slowly swing open.

"SON OF A BITCH!!!", I screamed, my voice strong despite the stinging pain in my throat.

Though I tried to convince myself it was all just my imagination, triggered by misplaced guilt from the deaths of people I knew, I am not afraid to admit that I ran out of the morgue with my tail between my legs. I did not speak to a soul, bolting straight for the washroom to splash cold water onto my face. Who on earth would be dumb enough to believe me anyway? Corpses dont breathe, and they certainly cant open doors. I took a deep breath, but as the air reached the back of my mouth, I felt a severely unpleasant sensation. Pulling my cheeks away, I looked into my mouth, and nearly screamed: my molars had turned black and rotten, my throat resembled a warning label on a pack of cigarettes, and my tongue was almost grey. The nauseating scent of decomposition trickled out of my mouth and into my nose, making my eyes water. Maybe what I heard from the bodies was my imagination, but the physical changes in me were quite real.

On my way back to the morgue, I picked up a few heavy-duty locks from the janitors closet. It was just for my own peace of mind. Using the locks, I secured the cooling units. If nothing else, the doors wouldnt accidentally open anymore.

Every single inhale and exhale brought with it a searing pain, as well as a strong sulfuric taste. I was getting really sick of the horrid flavor. In the cold and deserted morgue, I paced back and forth, trying to snuff out every horrible theory coming to the forefront of my mind. Was it cancer? Had I been poisoned? Was I going insane? I was so lost in my thoughts that I failed to notice the new corpse waiting for me on the operating table, until a movement caught my eye. I saw its chest rise. It was subtle, but I was sure of it. Was Doctor Chang playing a cruel joke? No, I hadnt told anyone about my fears: how could he have known? I approached the body hesitantly. As my heart throbbed desperately against the walls of my chest, I pulled back the white sheet that was draped over his body.

There, on my table, lay Adrien Carter, the last of the med students. My legs felt weak as I watched his corpse in disbelief. One death? Unfortunate. Two deaths? Suspicious. THREE deaths? There was no way to rationalize how three medical residents had perished, all within the span of a few days. My trembling fingers took hold of Mr. Carters chart, and my eyes darted through it, reading only the keywords: depression, stress, suicide, hanging. His family thought he'd done himself in because med school had proven to be too stressful. It wasn't unusual for residents to get a little depressed, and I could almost buy the story, if not for one crucial detail: the look on Adrien's face. His eyes and muscles were twisted in absolute terror. It wasn't the look of pain and regret you sometimes see when people hang themselves. It wasn't the peaceful acceptance of one's fate. No, it was a look of primal fear that I had never seen on anyone before. An emotion so raw that I could practically feel it by proxy. It sent chills down my spine, and I had to throw a sheet over his face to be able to continue my work, though I wish I hadn't.

The sheet moved. I screamed, but my throat was so tight that the sound could barely make it through.

Quickly, without even completing the autopsy, I rolled Adrien's body into one of the cooling units, and locked him in there. I could hear all three of them breathing from the other side. They were breathing a dead man's final breath. A breath we had stolen. It was all my fault. I had done this to them. I had killed each and every one of those young medical students, all for a cheap laugh. Their blood was on my hands. I had cursed them. I had cursed myself. They continued breathing, even as I ran out of the room. I could hear the echoes of their deep exhales as I frantically ran to my car and drove home, breaking the speed limit. What did it matter if I was arrested? I was going to die soon, anyways.

So here I am, writing this to you. Consider this a mea culpa, if you will. Though not directly by my hands, I caused the deaths of three young medical students, and have cursed myself to the same fate. I'm afraid I'm not long for this world: I can feel a lump in my throat now. My autopsy will probably reveal a tumor of some sort. I could keep quiet, I could preserve my legacybut for my own peace of mind, I couldnt leave without revealing the truth. I am sorry. To the loving families of Rene Jackson, Brandon O'Neil, and Adrien Carter: I am so terribly, terribly sorry. 




 Magnetic fields, man. They can really mess you up. I watched a documentary once where they put his helmet on a dude. It imitated magnetic fields. The guy started having that creepy crawly feeling you get when you're alone but feel someone there with you. Crazy stuff! 




 I had a ton of weird stuff happen to me in a house I used to live in. I once GENUINELY believed a burglar broke in, only to investigate and find the house empty. The place was creepy from the get-go, what with the previous tenants having left overnight without telling anyone, and the poems of suicide written in crayon in what ended up being my room. I mean, this sounds like some kind of horror movie BS, but I'm being dead serious. I'd see figures sometimes, too. And I don't mean small apparitions caught in the corner of my vision. I mean full-blown figures, while I was 100% concious, and that I could follow into other rooms before they disappeared.


It wasn't even that old of a house. Maybe 35-45 years old when we rented it.


My theory was either a brain tumor, or some kind of electromagnetic field seriously messing with my head, 'cause my parents and sister never saw anything. My friends; however, said they could 'feel' things---even before I ever mentioned weird stuff going down. 




 I'm in!

Someone stole my MS Office and they're going to pay. You have my Word. 




 Try to find a street artist and ask them to draw your caricature. That way, you'll know how other people see you. If it looks like youwell, it'll disprove my theory. No harm trying. 




 That's pretty chilling.

Perhaps when you passed, your soul got transferred to someone else? Someone who was brain dead? Maybe you see yourself in your reflection only because that's what you want to see, but you actually look like someone else.
