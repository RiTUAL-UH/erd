 **Terra Mystica**

Before TM I've played a few gateway games that I found slightly interesting - Catan, Carcassonne, Hanabi etc. But in those games you forget most of what you did the next day. TM is the first game where I find the whole game replaying in my head after I go home, regretting over bad decisions, feeling smug about good choices made, discussing strategies with friends, yearning to try new factions, and eventually became the game I purchased. 




 **Age of Empires III** - merchants, captains, soldiers, monks

**Manhattan Project** - workers, scientists, engineers

**Belfort** - Dwarves, Elves

**Lancaster** - workers with different skill levels, you are essentially bidding worker placement spots with workers

**The Ancient World** - workers with different skill levels. You can share a worker placement spot if you meet certain criteria (e.g. skill lvl workers already there)

**Viticulture** - each player has a special worker that can give you bonuses/use blocked spaces. 




 Nice! I was actually thinking of just buying cubes to replace the chips and be able to carry the game in a deck box.. 




 Yes we did. 
I was the first player to get 2 tuna boats while everyone else had one.

I also had other buildings that gave me income when 12-13 were rolled.  




 New to me - 

**XCOM** Decent real-time coop. Probably becomes better when everyone is familiar with the cards and aliens and can make decisions much quicker.

**Captains of Industry** The highlight of the week. Really interactive economic game! Players produce and set prices of resources and the market interactions follow closely microeconomic theories. Will definitely play again.

**Belfort** - Decent blend of worker placement and area control. It could get more vicious than other typical euros.

**Legendary: Aliens deck building game** - another alien themed coop. I like the sense of escalation and you really do need to help each other out in this game.

**Machi Koro w/ The Harbour Expansion** - the expansion is new to me. I think it makes the game too long for what it is. The Tuna Boat strategy is very strong, and I got two turns where I scored $30+ coins. Not sure if I want to play again.

Games I've played before:

**Shadowrun: Crossfire**, **Stone Age**, **Trajan**, **Terra Mystica** 




 When learning new games with an indefinite end, I usually ask the person who's teaching "how many rounds does the game usually last?"

It helps for planning a strategy.

For games like Tzolkin, you just have to assume that other people will screw you over whenever they can, so always be prepared for a shortened round. 




 Awesome!
It's interesting to see that it drops off slower than the overall 100. 




 Great chart!

Do you mind doing one for strategy games only? Thanks!

 That was me on the what did you play this week thread.

More details around the game:

New map, scoring for borders.

Final results for bidding- Shapeshifters 17, Nomads 12, Acolytes 4, Aurens 0

End game score:  Shapershifters 128, Aurens 125, Nomads 119, Acolytes 110 




 Carcassonne: Each cycle begins with a drafting of tiles. With N players, each player draws N tiles from the bag, keep 1, pass the rest along, repeat until the final tile. You should now have N tiles in your hand, This allows for N rounds of actions with the normal rules (without drawing a tile at the end of round). Repeat cycles until all tiles run out. 




 The paper is thin, like a normal card, so it could get bent easily. I know the tableau doesn't play a significant part in the game (the cards do), but a similar thickness to that of the Imperial Settlers tableau would be much better. 




 [Link to expansion rules](http://zmangames.com/rulebooks/Terra_Mystica_Fire_ _Ice.pdf)
Last page - new game options - factions for auction.

At the beginning of the game, draw 5 races out of the bag (the expansion comes with faction tokens). Start a round robin auction using victory points. Winner gets to choose which race he/she wants and also the starting position. Repeat until all races have been chosen. The person who chooses last will always pay 0.

This way, there is still an incentive for people to play weak races as you probably won't need to pay for using it. Obviously the bidding only works when all players are experienced and are able to estimate the point differences for each faction after initial setup. 




 Since the board for placing rooms to be built have all the details, don't bother taking out the rooms from the box until someone decide to build a room. Then the player will find the tile from the box, and put a token of some sort on the board for placing rooms to indicate it has been built. 




 Great week for me.

Games new to me:

**The Ancient World** x2: Lovely tableau building Euro about expanding your empire and fighting titans. Player interaction mainly through active blocking and card drafting. Only issue with it is the poorly manufactured tableau and I had no idea why they had to put dice rolling into it.

**Chicago Express** - Fast paced game about buying shares and running train companies. Loved the semi-cooperative element in it. Not sure about replayability as there is no variability in setup.

**Fauna** - great family game. Love it when everyone gets it wrong.

Games that I played before:

**Terra Mystica** w/Fire and Ice. Played the Shapeshifters by bidding it with 17 points at the beginning. Won by 3 points. The bidding mechanism does make the game a lot tighter.

**Panamax** x 2 - Still my top game of 2014. Looking forward to playing with an entire table of experienced players. Rules explanation is so tiring..

**Greed** - A filler that I don't mind playing.

**Orleans** - Tried the monk strategy and won. I should be able to get a few more plays out of this before it gets repetitive.

**Tzolkin** x 2 - Some day I will win at this.

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** x 4 - Bought my first ability. Hoping to play at least twice a week to save up karma for some better abilities! 




 Interesting perspective on interactions and replayability! 

I just played Chicago Express today - it was roughly an hour though, are you referring to another game? 




 I have only been boardgaming for a year, and am curious about what long time gamers think about the boardgaming world over the past years/decades.

Has your favourite (or top-3) games changed many times?

Have you tried so many games that most new games feel "sort of like X, with the mechanic of Y and Z"?

What are the most noticeable changes in the boardgaming world? Do you like what you're seeing?  

Thanks!
