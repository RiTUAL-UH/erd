 Star wars. 




 Get ready for school. I was 5. 




 Chose his girlfriend over me. 




 Sounds exactly like her, if her stuff went walkabout and I was visiting FI then it would be an angry phone call demanding to know why I'd taken the item in question. Even though I knew my own innocence she would never believe it and tell me she "knew" I was lying. Looking back on it now she was probably projecting her own guilty conscience onto me. 




 My NSis used to take my stuff all time, when her and EBIL were first dating she would steal my straighteners and take them to his flat. Her reasoning for this was because I was unemployed and she wasn't, she needed them more for work. One time I was visiting my FI when we were still in a LDR, I'd left my suitcase by the front door and she went through it while I was sleeping and took the straighteners with her to work. I didn't find out until I got to his and phoned her. She decided that since we would "probably stay at his all weekend and play video games [I] didn't need them."

Another time she borrowed a cardigan for a night out with her work, for 4 weeks after this night out I asked for it back and was met with excuses of it being in the wash or lost in her bedroom (which was/is a disaster zone). One morning I got a phone call from her giggling away, evidently she'd lost my cardigan on that night out and decided I didn't need to know but wasn't she amazing for finding it? (It turned out a co worker had put it in his bag and had only just found it.) She couldn't understand why I was angry with her, even after she admitted she had had no intention of telling me the truth if it hadn't been found. 




 Who do I ask about getting one of those? It's never been mentioned at my university. I'll need to email some people in September.
