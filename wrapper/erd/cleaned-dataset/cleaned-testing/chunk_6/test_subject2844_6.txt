 How in the fuck do you get your GoPro back? 




 This ^^^^^^^^  




 I've found myself in awkward conversations before and wanted Reddit's advice on how to politely walk away without seeming abrubt or rude. 




 You've uncovered an ancient oreo! 




 Don't have enough upvotes to give! 




 You hit the nail on the head. It's the Seahawks fan who still have the price tags on their jerseys. There are a lot of them out there and they don't know how to be proper fans, so they resort to being internet trolls. Not a good look! 




 Welcome to the club my friend!

 He's blocked me on 3 different Twitter accounts. He is the ultimate hack. He flings mud against the wall and sees what will stick. If you question him or disagree with him on Twitter he will block you. You can't be a total fear mongerer and then be a big pansy when people call you out on your shit... 




 I came here to say just that, glad you have the top comment!  




 Love it, my Berner thinks he's a lapdog too and he's 105 pounds. Bernese mountain dogs are the best dogs on the planet! 




 Because living 




 Is OP Rob Gronkowski? 




 Foxy 




 RIP Oscar, Giants fans all over are sending positive thoughts to your family in this tough time. 




 Cute pup! 




 Awesome picture my friend! 




 Beautiful San Francisco? 




 Ya but as we saw last week, the Rams seem to run out of steam in the second half. I personally hope that this is the beginning of a long unraveling for the Seahawks. 




 My buddy ran into them at Best Buy tonight. They must have been going on quite the shopping spree! 




 There was a runner on first and the ball got by AJ. Since the runner would advance on the passed ball, he flopped on Ishikawi's backswing lightly grazing him so that the runner couldn't advance. 

TL;DR: AJ Pierzynski is an assclown 




 Fuck that fucking guy! 




 Slow internet 




 Shut your commie mouth! 




 True American Patriot! 




 Let's get rid of him!!! We were so much better under Singletary... 




 The Sticky Bandit strikes again! 




 My dog ate one of my fiance's socks and had to have 4 feet of his intestines removed. He has a bit of a sensitive stomach now, but he doesn't eat socks anymore.  




 I have a Bernese Mountain dog and he is the most gentle dog on the planet. He thinks he is a lap dog, despite being 105 pounds. Also, he is so sweet and gentle with children and other dogs. He is simply the best! 




 Epic photobomb! 




 What is your dog's name? My bernese loves to dig holes too. He gets so dirty though haha. 




 That's incredible! I would love for Cooper to live to 14. I walk him frequently and shower him with love. He is simply the best! 




 They have a high likelihood of cancer and joint problems. Mine is 5 and healthy as can be. I hope he lives forever, that would be ideal! 




 My berner loves to snuggle! He always cries until you give him some form of physical contact. Big old dogs that are extremely gentle and loving. 




 My cheeks sweat when I eat green apples. It's pretty weird and I've never heard of that happening to anyone else. 




 Berners are the cutest puppies. I have a 5 year old Berner and I always melt when I look back at pictures of him as a puppy. 




 "Omar don't scare." 




 Replying so I can listen to this later 




 Did nobody else get the reference? It's even more clear when you look at OP's username haha. Well done Costanza! 




 I feel bad for those poor husbands 




 Touch sir 




 You wear a condom when you have sex with your wife?  




 Ya we should probably set that up. Put him on a leash and drag and kick him around like he did to his puppy. 




 Everyone should join me in signing this petition to get this dirtbag fired. There is no place for animal cruelty like this. As a dogowner, that video made me sick to my stomach. Please participate!

 I buy this thing before every bachelor party I go on. You haven't lived until you've seen a grown man going to town on a stripper with one of these things. Pure comedy! 




 Ate one of my fiance's socks as a puppy. He had to had 4 feet of his intestines removed. He's been an expensive dog so far, but he is the sweetest dumb dog ever. 




 No

 It woke both my girlfriend and me up. That was a serious shaker. 6.1 has got to be the second biggest earthquake since 89'. I am all for smaller earthquakes, as I figure that will take some pressure off of the fault lines, but I'm not gonna lie and say I didn't jump out of bed and quiver like a little girl haha. Earthquakes are no joke. 




 I didn't realize there were so many Kawakami-apologists out there. I can't stand this guy with the entire fiber of my being. Didn't expect such a lukewarm reception to this.
