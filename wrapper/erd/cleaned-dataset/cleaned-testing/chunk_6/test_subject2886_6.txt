 Hangover breakfast for me means the meal I can finally make myself make at 2pm or later. Or that random food I don't remember ordering. The chips from the tacos I apparently ordered and devoured last night count. 




 Peasant food is usually the best food. 




 In the TATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!!!!!!!! 




 Burninating the country side! 









 This is fascinating! I do something like the last one, but I just hold it between my first two fingers with the yarn behind it, but my tension has always been fine.

OP, I have been feeling the same, so maybe trying one of these other techniques could help. My yarn holding wrist is the one that hurts the most. All I can say from my experience is to take breaks often and make sure you sleep with your wrists straight. If you want, I can contact a former friend with horrible wrists due to 12 years of violin for anything else that may help. PM me. 




 From what I've seen/heard from the one family member who eventually succumbed to it, the worst part is knowing that you're slowly losing yourself.

He was my great uncle (I think that's what you call it, my grandma's brother) and I didn't spend much time with him. But I remember one really powerful event. The whole family went out to dinner, and five minutes after ordering, he turned to my 10-year-old self and told me he couldn't remember what he'd ordered. He almost started crying.

By the end, he was wishing for death because he had been gone for years. The whole family felt the same way. 




 Yup, that's what we called them. Egg in the hole or egg in the basket makes more sense, but what can you say?  




 I moved into my first apartment last August and will be living here till August 2016, and I generally agree with this list.

I only have a couple nonstick pans and a few pots. I've dropped hints that a nice, big cast iron Dutch oven is all I want for my birthday, and I'm getting myself a decent thermometer at the same time.

As a college kid, I will say my (totally unnecessary) panini press/griddle is amazing because I can make a quesadilla or grilled cheese without having to fumble around for a spatula; as a baker, last year's birthday present (a super legit KitchenAid stand mixer) is my favorite.

That being said, I'm lucky to have a 1-person apartment with 4 separate rooms. I'm scared for when I have to move and live in a tiny little box. 




 Without the monsters, that's what my family has always called them. 




 Haven't had a proper kouign amann since I went to Britanny. From what I remember, they are even more caramely and just melt in your mouth, no chewing required.

I've yet to find a recipe that truly lives up to the ones made by old ladies in the middle of nowhere who have been doing nothing else for 30 years. But these look good, and now I think I may have to redouble my efforts. 




 Catfish (and Tilapia and other bottom feeders) taste like what they eat. Personally, I find it tastes more like mud than anything else.

Tuna and swordfish, however, do taste "fishy" to me. A properly prepared ahi tuna steak is expensive because it tastes like heaven. 




 And was charismatic enough and a good enough orator that he convinced so many others that he was, too. 




 Some probability thing. I know I should have been able to figure it out by myself, but my brain isn't wired for finite. Calc, however, made sense when I took it. 




 I once tried to get help with a finite problem and got the answer "yellow is a color." I just don't speak the language, I think. 




 Natalie Portman and Tina Fey. But I identify as bi, so there's that. 




 It's important to find one that you like. It takes a while, and I'm personally trying to find just that, after mine had to leave, but a good therapist can mean the word.

The same goes for meds. Maybe you don't even need them, but when you find the right one, the right dosage, the right combination, you'll know, and it will help. I'm lucky in that the one I was given in the hospital after my suicide attempt only took a couple dosage changes to be perfect for me (and it isn't one that is commonly used, from what I've heard, and was only given to me to make me gain weight, which has become a problem now, almost 2 years later), but once I found the perfect dosage, it has been good. I won't deny that I still want to cut sometimes, but I've been able to bounce back from bad news faster than I would have.

I'm sorry if this post isn't helpful, but don't just write off therapy or meds because they haven't worked in the past. If you find one or both that works for you, it can be an enormous help. 




 He was also just an awful person to begin with, and only sold when I had a boyfriend. He still propositioned me. 




 Maaaaaaybe something like five pounds. I have standards. 









 The only guy I've ever used who eyeballed always packed fat for the girls and short for the dudes, but then expected the girls to sleep with him.

I only bought from him once. Sorry dude, not gonna sleep with you for an extra .2. 




 Fleece lined tights or leggings and wool leggings are my favorite thing. Last winter, when I had to go out with the -30F wind chill, and even other, less cold days, I was known to wear two pairs of each under my bigger velvet pants. They're warm, but still thin enough to layer like that, if need be. 




 Used Red Heart Super Saver in Frosty Green and Coffee. It is throw sized, and I would have made it bigger if I didn't have three other throws to make by Christmas. 









 A pillow to prop up my feet. It technically isn't quite don't yet, but considering my knees and back have been killing me lately and I've been propping my feet up on an empty two-liter to relieve the pain, I bet this will be the best thing ever. 




 I make one similar (I don't really have a pattern), but it's more like a cowl. Chain a fairly long starting chain, like collar bone to eyes, then dc in rows til it just fits around your neck. It's really nice when it gets cold, because you can double it, or pull it up so it covers your ears and face.

Simple, fast, but not too exciting. It does end up looking like a ribbed knit. 




 Scary! I've been on it for a little over a year, and probably have to stop because I can't stop gaining weight. Its so convenient, but health problems are no joke. 




 Dat geothermal energy. 









 I would watch the fuck out of Garak, Elim Garak. He's also one of my favorites, and leading up to him letting those Bajorans go.... mmmmm.  




 DS9 reminds me more of Babylon 5. Space Station, unexpected war, developed interpersonal relationships. 




 I can only ever drink iced coffee, even in January. I hate burning my tongue.

I only go to Starbucks a couple times a year, and usually drink my coffee black, so I felt my yearly PS Frap was just a cup full of sugar. And I know the frap adds extra sugar (I think), but it took me nearly three hors to finish. 




 Thanks! I was planning on stopping by the post office after class today, so I'll see if it will fit. 




 I mean, it was originally a heart medication. The side effects were just pleasant. 




 Dr. Pepper ham is my favorite. 




 I get that. I have 3.5 blankets to finish by Xmas, so I feel bad for every hour outside of class that I'm not working on them. At least my mom and dad have said they're ok with getting them a month or two after Xmas, but I also have 4 or 5 to get done by graduation in May, 3 for early my graduation in December, and I don't even want to know how many by next May. I guess I'm lucky that a lot of my friends are planning on taking a 5th year at college, like me, but still. Since I hope to spend several years in Africa after graduation, I need to finish all these blankets while I can still ship domestically. I'm already realizing the financial pain of shipping a blanket from Indiana to Washington State. I don't want to ship any others. 




 Wine is the best. And a good bottle of Gewurstraminer is never more than 2 minutes and $10 from me, except on Sundays, because Indiana is still in the dark ages. 




 Sometimes you want to go dancing (that's the only reason I ever go out), but making something with warm snuggles to keep you company is usually much nicer than dealing with loud music and too many people. 




 Oh no! I get that sometimes, so a break is good. Ice it if you need, and try to train yourself to sleep with them straight. It took me a couple months, but my wrists have felt so much better since I did. Really, my former friend who played the violin for 12 years taught me the best stretches. 




 AND she was a Mensa member. Bascially, she had pretty much everything going for her. 




 Oh I know. She's a personal hero for me. I wrote and essay on her way back in the 8th grade. Did you know she wasn't allowed in the Navy's medical team because she was too tall? She was a huge badass. 
EDIT: at least I think it was the medical team. It was something to do with the Navy. 




 That's pretty much what a rolling pin is. I mean, I used an empty wine bottle for a long time. 




 Like others have said, bread, cakes, and pastries. I will say I am biased, because I consider myself more of a baker than a cook, but it's very impressive when you pull a batch of croissants from scratch out of the oven when hosting a dinner party.

On top of that, risotto is something that seems impressive but is actually really easy. It's also one of my favorite comfort foods, especially in the winter, since you need to be over the stove for a while. 




 I'm embarking on a Julie and Julia type thing after I get Mastering the Art of French Cooking for my birthday in a little over a month.

Julia Child was considered a master for a reason. While a lot of the recipes require a lot of work, she is incredibly detailed in her books, and mastering those techniques makes it SO much easier to whip up something with what you've got. 




 Baking is also important. And on that note, learning to make puff pastry from scratch is good. Not necessary, but I find it fun, and it's really impressive. 




 "I'LL FUCKIN BURST YE" will forever be one of my favorite insults. 




 Amazing. The BART goes pretty much everywhere, and the different bus services will take you anywhere else.

But this is from the perspective of someone who lives in an area with no trains, buses that are usually so late that they end up on time a couple times a day, and an incredibly walkable/bike accessible downtown. 









 Such troublemakers. 




 Looks just like mine and apparently acts the same, too, haha. 




 It's just how I've always done it. I actually only just recently learned there was any other way. 




 That makes sense. When I do go out, I spend most of the time at one that is low key mot of the time, although at night it's so full of rowdy college kids. There's a drink there that is officially called "Adios Mother Fucker," although I just call it "that scary blue thing I will never order." Give me a vodka cranberry if I'm feeling rowdier than usual, or just a nice cider, thank you very much. 




 I winged these, but I've got a basic pattern.

Ch4, sl st into first ch. 
Hdc 8 into hole made by small loop, increase as normal for 2 rounds (2hdc in every st for first, 2 in every other for second)
2 rounds hdc in toe color, change color, 12 rounds hdc.
Change color, ch 1, hdc in next 16 st, ch 1, repeat for 3 more rows.
Sl st rectangle together, tie off.
Make 1 round hdc in heel/toe color, Change color.
9 rounds to make the ankle part.

The key to socks is making them smaller than you think you need. That will keep them from being too bulky. All together, this project took me just under 8 hours. Used some Red Heart Super Saver and an F (3.75) hook, and made sure to work it a litoe tighter than normal.

EDIT:  this pattern is for me, and I wear a size 6.5 shoe. Basically, you continue the rounds until you hit your ankle, then make the heel rectangle until it takes a little stretching to make it cover the rest of the bottom of your foot. The, you can make the rest go as long as you want. The key is to keep trying the first one on at each step, to see how it fits, write down what you do, and do the exact same thing for he second, unless one foot is significantly larger than the other. 









 Since turning 21 (my 22nd is in a month or so), I've realized that bars are fun maybe once a month. I'll still have a bottle of wine, but $10 for a night is better than $20-$50. 




 I've been watching DS9, and decided to take a little break from making my sister's Christmas Afghan to make socks. 




 Definitely still drinking, but having a bottle of wine while watching what you want on Netflix is better than going to your usual bar and trying to dance to songs you don't recognize because you haven't listened to pop radio in 10 years. Sometimes you still want to go dancing, but perfecting socks is more exciting than spending more by than $20 and still feeling awkward after 3 gin and tonics. 




 I'm pretty evenly split between introvert and extrovert. I feel a lot better when I hang out with people, but I also have what I call "no pants days," which all of my friends understand. And sometimes you get super excited when you finally master an object. 




 Haha, I took a break from my huge Afghan to make socks because it's starting to get a little chilly here in southern Indiana. And I have Star Trek going at all times. DS9 right now, I think I'll be going back to Voyager (my favorite) once this one is done. 




 I wish I had the roomie I had sophomore year, when we both still lived in the dorms, because I love her and I got her crocheting quite a bit, but living alone has its benefits, as well. 




 I still like to go out, but to shows at friends'  houses. Bars are nice maybe once a month, but I always end up spending too much money when I go, money that I could spend on yarn. 




 You choose to stay in on a Friday night and perfect your sock pattern, rather than go out with your friends.

Any other experiences like this?

EDIT: this is speaking from the point of view as a college senior. 




 Climb the mountain of conflict. You'll sound like a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews. 




 I had to restrain myself from going into a whole long thing citing Hobbes and Rousseau on human nature, but I'll summarize with this: humans are always fighting for resources, but form societies so they don't have to.

But I agree, it's safest to assume that everyone you meet is an asshole, and let them show you that they aren't.

Sorry, social contract theory is my shit, and I dork out to it even more when tipsy. Gin makes me a nerd. 




 I don't even want to know how many I'd have if my landlord hadn't capped it at two. 




 I had nightmares about my babies getting hurt, or running away, or any other bad thing when I spent 5 whole days on the other side of the country back in May, even though they were staying with family. I felt a little ridiculous, but I made a two page list of things for them, from "Bill gets 1 cup of food every day while Kate gets 3/4 cup," to "Bill likes to be called the big mister and Kate likes to be called baby." 




 Like I said above, nutmeg is the make or break for brioche for me. A tiny bit in a curry dish is also good, it just deepens the flavor in a strange way. 




 Same with nutmeg. I put a "pinch" in my brioche and couldn't imagine it any other way. 




 Going off the south side comment, 2nd street turns into a highway around the WalMart, and I believe that highway goes to Crane (but don't quote me on that). Once you get past the Kroghetto/hospital area, it's very residential, with fewer students, so if you'd prefer to be away from the craziness, but still close to the bars, I'd suggest looking there. Serendipity, The Root Cellar, The Back Door, and Player's Pub are all 10 or so minutes walking from the hospital, and Brother's, The Vid, and The Bluebird are also fairly close. Sport's is around there, too, but idk if that would be a good fit (I've never been, simply because I've only ever head it touted as "a great place to bang drunk chicks in the bathroom"). 




 Chrome gave me something called snap.do. And something else makes it keep coming back, so I have to remove it at least once a month.

As for other things, I'm not the best with computers, so I just bring my laptop to my dad every time something weird happens. 




 Know someone who broke her thumb hitting the wall after a 50 freestyle race. And I've sprained an ankle doing a flip turn too quick. 




 I used to be ridiculously allergic (to the point where I'd get hives anywhere a cat would lick me), but I spent a year spending almost every day with a friend who had one, and now I only get a reaction if I get cat hair directly on my eyes. I live with two, but I know a lot of allergies won't go away so easily (ask me about metal, spermicide, or aerosol products). 




 I made a New Year's resolution to make blankets for my family for Xmas and friends for graduation. The graduation present imq shipping soon won't be washed, because the recipient is planning on getting a cat anyway, but my dad and sister are super allergic, so I'll be washing theirs a few times before the gifting.  




 It's just extra sad because the recipient is really allergic. 




 Haha, I'm just trying to finish a bunch of afghans for my family for Xmas, but he keep deciding to lie on top of my work, or his sister decides to chew through my yarn. The things you deal with as a cat owner. 




 If you can make it, PM me and maybe we can meet up. I'm going with my best friend, and at least I plan to  e in line by 5, haha. 




 My nails are getting the TARDIS blue treatment. It's free tomorrow night, and the tickets are first come first serve, starting when the doors open at 6. There's a showing of The Intruders at 7, DW live pre-show at 8, and the new season at 8:15. 




 Bloomington. I say small because it's pretty small when you factor out the 40k students. If you're near, go line up at the BusChum before 6pm. 









 I'm so lucky, there's a special screening in my town tomorrow! Why they chose small college town, Indiana, I will never know, but I'm soooooooo pumped.
Edit: and by them, I mean BBC America decided to post about it on Facebook. 




 Like I said, I feel terrible for the kid (whose name is Jager, by the way), but have very little sympathy go the mother. Maybe mow heartless, but I honestly hope the whole thing straightened her up. 




 Cute things make English too difficult. Kitten don't "explore," they "splore." They don't get "excited," they get "escited." 




 Yep, mine and the food is in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. Otherwise my ginger boy would chew through the bag and eat everything. 




 I had a Facebook friend who didn't stop drinking when she was pregnant. She ended up giving birth to twin boys three months early, one of them died almost immediately, and then she posted multiple times a day with a gofundme page asking for help keeping the other one alive.

I ended up defriending her because I believe you have to lie in the bed you made, but I feel so bad for the kid. I actually don't know if he made it, but I hope he did and that his mother learned from the tragedy. 




 Does this mean I'm doing myself harm if I heat up my nonstick pan while I'm slicing bacon and then putting it on? I never add extra oil when I cook bacon, but I turn on the stove, put bread in the toaster, and cut the bacon into halves or thirds before I use the pan. It probably doesn't take more than two minutes to do all that, but now I'm worried. 




 This sounds amazing, especially because I have a serious aversion to mayo. Will be trying this out soon. 




 Let's hope we all get boyfriends like that. The guy I'm seeing is just amazed when he comes over and sees something ivew made. 




 This is a big reason why I always ball my yarn. It adds some work at the beginning, but I don't have to deal with tangles and yarn vomit halfway through an afghan. 




 Thank you! I think that's only a little more than a hour from me! 




 Oh goodness me, I'm not even sure. Probably 9 or 10. I'm turning 22 in October, and it has been my go-to destressing activity for forever. I know I learned to knit when I was 8 and basic embroidery stitches before I can remember (great part about having a mother with a degree in fashion design and construction), but crochet has always been my favorite. 




 If you're more comfortable with PMing me the reply, I understand, but where in Indiana is she based? I'd love to get some local(ish) yarn, and I've been thinking about dying my own, too. I'm in Bloomington. 




 I usually put liner only in the outer third or so of my lower waterline. I feel that it opens up my eyes, and I just don't feel finished without a little something there. A nice dark brown (not black!) Works really well. 




 Yay, another reason Indiana sucks really hard! 




 Cheap canadian whiskey + canada dry is a favorite of mine. Super canadian drink, we call it. 




 I can't do flavored vodka after downing a fifth worth of caramel appletinis. And a really bad time I had once with schnapps. 




 You wouldn't return your child because you didn't feel like taking care of it. An animal is just the same. 




 My little lady came to me as a foster. She was a barn cat, and was 12-weeks old when she first came into my life. I'm so happy I decided to adopt her, because my former roomie (who initially brought into the apartment) didn't ever take her to the vet, fed her straight tuna from a can, and hardly spent any time with her. A month or two after she came to live with me, I decided to adopt her, took her to the vet, and found out she had had worms the entire time. Luckily she has been healthy ever since (it's been about a year), and loves the ginger friend I got for her. 




 My parents' cat love to take lap rides on my grandmother's wheelchair. Now that she's back up to a walker, he just tries to trip her with head buts. 




 You've done it. After being abused, falling for the wrong guy, and never thinking I could love again, you've turned me around. I'm not in love with you yet, but you make me feel like I could be. And more importantly, I feel like maybe you could actually love me back, which is such a strange feeling for me. You understood when I needed a couple days to cry after finding out I'd been stabbed in the back by someone who used to be like a sister to me, and you're okay with the fact that sometimes I just need to talk about the abuse that guy put me through.

Thank you. I more than really really like you. And I needed someone to provide to me that I could feel this way again. 




 I like to put a little on one side of any simple deli style sandwich. I really like it on roast beef and swiss. 




 Occasionally, but that method has worked pretty well for me. Only time it hasn't is with this one rimmel lipstick whose color can only be described as "baby prostitute." 




 And now I need to watch it for the fourth time this week. That's ok, cuz it will give me time for my base color to dry before embarking on a striping tape adventure.  




 My target never has testers, but it's easy to hold the lipstick closeish to your face and teeth and look in one of the mirrors. I'll do a sigle swatch of a textured polish in store, but that's it. 




 I hated Chicago style for so long, because they didn't even tell us that there were citation styles outside of MLA in high school. Now I prefer it, and nothing pisses me off more than when a professor doesn't specify a style, but marks you down for not using MLA. 




 Seconding baba ganouj! I usually hate things that are blended like that, and used to hate eggplant, but that turned me around. 




 Bathroom is les toilettes, plural masculine, I believe. The throne itself is masculine, but the phrase "faire la toilette" means to get ready (brush you teeth, shower, makeup, whatever), and that is feminine. 




 Besides Fleur, who also married in, sadly, no, unless you wanna get into the epilogue. Luckily my ginger is a boy, so there were many more names to choose from. Ended up with Bill. 




 I didn't even consider getting serious with the guy I've been seeing until he got approval from the cats. 




 I'm of the opinion that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, but I'm a nerd like that.
