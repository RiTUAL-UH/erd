 I like a lot of indie/alternative, and some electronic stuff. Some of my favorites are The Arcade Fire, Joy Division, Grizzly Bear, Radiohead, Purity Ring, and The National. 

As I've grown older I've fallin in love with classical music, especially Romantic and Impressionist composers. My favorite composer is Debussy. There's something that I've found in his music that I can't find anywhere else.

 The other night I was out with some new people who'd I'd never gone out with before. They asked me a lot of questions , and I was a little caught off guard having to talk about myself so much. I'd been drinking quite a bit, and I know that didn't help, but I just couldn't find interesting things to say about myself. I pretty much just threw my hands up and said I'm boring. I'm taking a year off university and am living in a city I'm unfamiliar with. I don't know how to make that sound interesting. I wanted to get the spotlight and have them talk about themselves a little bit more. Talking about myself made me feel vulnerable, and I think I should come up with some prefabricated answers about myself to just spew out when people ask me. What's the best way to talk about yourself without sounding like a complete narcissist? 




 I've come to the point where I think I've realized how much self-consciousness is part of my character. I just can't help being and acting self-conscious all the time. I just went out with friends, and I'm thinking about how I drank too much, talked to too many people, and danced way crazier than everyone else. I'm trying to get myself to go out and meet people, realize that I'm going to make mistakes (sometimes overdo it) and then learn from it, but I just can't seem to pull myself out of my ingrained self-consciousness. Half the time when i joke around it's at my own expense and it's just frustrating to see myself do that again and again. I guess the only way to get over it is to keep going forward and learn from my mistakes, but I wish there was an easier way. 




  Thanks! It's been a little strange. I was having real problems with the sedative affect that Mirtazapine had, I always stuck in a brain fog, but now I'm feeling quick and judgemental. It's a funny combination of feelings; I guess I'll just have to wait to see how things balance out. 




 So I've got my prescription reduced from 45 mg every night to 15 mg. This is the third day on the lower dose, and I think I'm still adjusting because I've been in a funny mood. I've all the sudden become really judgemental, but unlike before I'm not teetering on despair. It's like being lucidly aware of being in a crappy mood, so I'm sort of laughing about it.  I'm being a bit more outwardly negative, but I only feel a little bit worse than I did before. I was wondering if any of you have experienced anything similar when switching doses. 




 I'm on 45mg of mirtazapine. It really helped me when I was at my lowest; it  gave me something solid to stand on and gave me the motivation to work on myself. Now that I'm doing much better I'm going to see about getting off of it. I think it's affecting my speech and ability to think clearly. Also, it will knock you out, and for me the sedative affect doesn't wear off for a few hours after I wake up. 




 It's actually what makes me doubt my psychologist. I get very emotionally invested in fiction.  I wouldn't say that I get 'attatched' but I feel what the characters do and enjoy that a lot.  




 I've got this story that I keep telling people, and I just wanted to run it by /r/socialskills to see whether or not you think this is one I should keep to myself. Everyone who has worked customer service has their own war stories to tell about the people who they've had to serve. I used to work at a video store that rented a lot of porn and I have lots of weird stories about the kinds of people that'd come in. I'm just wondering if those stories probably comes off as a bit creepy or as  funny anecdotes about working customer service. I told it to some people tonight, and it seemed to go over well, those stories might be off putting. Just looking for some input. 




 I'm on 45 mg of Remeron. I'll make sure to bring it up to my psychiatrist. 




 Anxiety is making me trip up every time I talk to someone. I often pause and get caught up midway through a sentence. It's making my social anxiety even worse than it already is, because it's usually better if I just don't say anything. I know what I'm trying to say, but when I'm trying to say it I usually stumble. When I stumble I usually defer to longer words and it just comes across very awkward. Now that I'm thinking about how I speak all the time it's just gotten worse. Do any of you have any advice for managing speaking anxiety while avoiding putting too much pressure on socializing? 









 I've started reading poetry aloud. It's really good practice.  




 I've always been really impressed by people who can express themselves without saying a lot. It seems to me that this is a really important social skill that would help make conversation more fluid and interesting. I tend to over think what I'm saying, and have noticed that I sometimes ramble and stumble over myself when I'm trying to convey an idea or opinion. Do any of you have any advice for speaking more efficiently? What are some ways to stop over thinking what you say while still being conscious about what you say and how you say it?  




 I often feel like it comes worst at times when it feels like it's appropriate to say something, but I just have nothing to say I have some idea of what I'm going to say, but by the time I get to actually saying it it comes out a mess. For example, I was trying to relay to my brother what I thought about a business idea he'd come up with and why his educational background gives him an advantage in the field he's hoping to go into, but it just came out a complete disaster and made the conversation awkward.  




 I used to monologue a lot, but I don't as much now. Even when I'm having a seemingly normal conversation with other people it seems like I get cut off a lot. I don't know whether it has to do with the rhythm of my speaking or if the people I spend time with are just rude.  




 I've noticed lately that I'm having trouble transferring thoughts and concepts into speech. Sometimes the words get confused and come out wrong, and other times it feels like I haven't fully put together an idea before I begin speaking. It often ends up sounding like I'm beating around an idea without actually saying anything. It's like I have it all sorted out in my head (generally), but when I actually go to tell other people about it it just comes out vague and sometimes nonsensical. It's made conversations more awkward, because sometimes I take a moment to recollect my thoughts, and other people think that that's an opportunity to cut in. This is incredibly frustrating, and I'm having a lot of anxiety about it.

 Have any of you experienced this? Is this an AS thing? 




 The other day a co-worker stopped me and asked if I was alright. I asked "why do I look upset?" She stopped for a second and said " It's just that when you're not serving customers your eyes look like you're on the verge of tears." I was caught off guard. I told her it was just the weather and that I hadn't been getting enough sleep, but for someone to read me like blew me away. 




 I'm not all together bad at talking to strangers when they are 100% strangers, but when it's someone who I have a social obligation to talk to because of the friends of friends thing I have problems. It doesn't seem like they take much interest in me either, so I'm always the one trying to find something to talk about. 

Sometimes I have trouble talking with strangers, but it's nothing compared to talking to acquaintances especially when the conversation is 1 on 1.  




 Man this is something I've always struggled with. How do you become friends with your friend's friends? I said goodbye to some friends' at the airport and was in a group with their friends. I'd met those people a few times before, but I never became "friends" with them. After we left the airport one of them said they could give me a ride home. That was the single most awkward moment of my life. I tried to make small talk and talk about our common friends, but i failed miserably, and that's why I'm asking this.  




 I've been taking my medication (45 mg of Remeron) since July, and for the most part it's been a great help. There are a few days every month where I don't feel quite like myself. I feel foggy, like my perception is clouded, and I'm pretty sure it's the medication. 

 I missed a dose of my medication last night (I got home really late and forgot about it), so this evening I've been feeling very irritable and self-conscious. My evening was spent complaining to my family and being really self-conscious about what I was saying. I was running a meta-conversation about how it's not normal for someone my age (21) to be candid about his problems. To say the least, missing my medication made me act oddly, and quickly caused my symptoms to come back.

Have any of you experienced a fast reemergence of symptoms after missing a dose of your medication? Is it normal to have such a strong reaction? 




 Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety with obsessive traits. I have social anxiety sometimes. 




 I think that I like it in concept. There's something appealing about just having a one off encounter with someone, or just no-strings-attached sex. I've been in situations where I could have had casual sex a few times, but every time so far I've passed it up. There was a lot of social reasons I didn't have casual sex with the women I could have. I didn't affect other friendships or make things messy even in a no-strings-attached situation. 

I've always thought that it'd satisfy me in the short term but leave me feeling alone. Part of being an INFJ is sort of having an idealized view that's difficult to make real. I used to wish true love existed, but I don't think I can or want to anymore. I've tried to separate sex from affection, because it seems easier to cope with relationships that way. 




 Lately I've been trying hard to stop talking about myself unless someone asks. I've stopped giving my opinion or making statements and observations unless someone asks me directly. I've even stopped sharing relevant experiences I've had even when it wouldn't be entirely out of place. 

My conversations have improved and people seem to be responding to me better than ever before. The conclusion I've come to is that most people have no interest in what others have to say, most of the time, and to become a better conversationalist you have to say and ask really general things. Any kind of definitive statement, observation, or opinion slows down most conversations so I guess to be a better conversationalist it's best to avoid them.

Do you agree or disagree? I'd like to hear what people have to say.

 




 I'm like you, I can make easy banter with strangers almost no problem but friends/acquaintances/people I'd like to get to know I have more of a problem with. I think that the anonymity of talking to strangers takes off that social pressure edge and allows me to be a witty, flirty and overall charming person. When with friends on the other hand I feel like its some sort of serious balancing act. I'm always questioning how I should say things; is the conversation going to be idle chit chat or are we going to discuss our lives and feelings, what things should I keep to myself, should I ask some more personal questions? I feel like when I'm invested in another person I have this pressure to impress. 

I think trying to strike a balance between casual conversation with friends, and real deep meaningful conversation is really important and easier said than done. Personally I've had relationships turn to only deep conversation and each time I'd hang out with those people everything seemed really melancholy. I love engaging, in-depth conversations, but I've tried to limit how much I have them lately. They can always lead to someone getting offended or it becoming a bit of an argument if your not careful. If someone else initiates them I'll give take part, but I usually don't bring weighty stuff to the table anymore because it makes most people uncomfortable. 

Small talk isn't usually really about anything in my experience, it's more about socializing with other people, reading their body language making them laugh that kind of thing. It's more of a go with the flow kind of social bonding. I think often there's more socializing going on when people participate in small talk than when people are talking about weighty things.  

 




 I have a horrible habit of being sarcastically self-deprecating when I feel awkward in a social situation. For example me and some friends were joking around about some of them visiting each other when a few of us move to another region of our country. Anyway during the conversation no one seemed to mention for a few minutes that I was going to be living there too (everyone else is moving to a town just outside of the city I'll be moving to) anyway everyone was making plans about visiting that city and staying with friends they have there. I was about to mention that people could stay with me when someone else did for me saying it in a tone was like, Oh how could we have forgotten that test_subject2960 will be there too!. I laughed and played the obvious oversight off as sort of "Oh I don't really matter anyway don't worry about it!"Very Sarcastic obviously joking, but I don't like that sort of self-deprecation and I have a tendency to react in that way without thinking. How can I learn to stop doing this and work on playing things off in a more confident way? 




 Lately I've been trying to improve my banter with other people but its made my interactions so awkward I barely want to leave my house. Its like I'm analyzing my own thoughts and speech as I'm talking. Its making me trip over really simple sentences, or give really long explanations for simple things because I'm in overdrive trying to think of what would be the best way to say something. 

I'm want to be more confident and comfortable in the way I interact with others. I'm trying to watch what I say, keep things casual, banter, and be funny, but by trying to be more savvy with what I say and how I interact I'm messing up more than ever. Really I try to think of the best way to respond in a conversation, but the overanalysis is just weighing me down. At the same time if I don't pay attention to what I'm saying I'll say something stupid.

For example a coworker the other day mentioned that it was Mother's day in the UK and said she'd wished her Mom happy Mother's day. I knew she had lived in the UK for a few years so it wasn't completely random, but all I could come up with was asking her if there were any other "holidays" that were different there then in North America. That's a stupid question, I probably should have asked her something like if she's still doing something for her Mom for north american mother's day or something like that. Later she was talking about some neat little piece of tupperware she had and all I did was say it was neat  and that I probably need to start collecting neat little things like that because I'll be moving out on my own soon. 

Those are just two examples, they don't seem too awkward there but it was weird stilted conversation. On top of that anytime that I open my mouth I feel I need to psych myself up and what comes out is usually just really confused speech. Like trying to talk to one of the registrars at my university about a form I lost myself mid sentence and pretty much had to apologize and start over. I don't know what to do, it's like there's a mess between my brain and my mouth and I can't fix it.

Anybody got any ideas?  




 My therapist has recently brought up the possibility that I might have aspergers syndrome or another mild form of autism. Looking at my behaviour and the way I interact with people, I don' think this is entirely out of the ballpark. As far as I can tell the advantage of getting a diagnosis would be that I'd be realistically able to know some of my limitations and understand why I interact with the world the way I do. If there are any other reasons why I should or shouldn't pursue a diagnosis I'd like to hear them

 I don't really know where to start when it comes to getting a diagnosis. so I'm just fielding this to see if any of you have any advice on where to get started. 
 




 Since I started working on my anxiety I've noticed something about myself and was wondering if others have similar behaviour. I find I vent my anxieties to people close to me almost compulsively. It's such a weight off my shoulders to ask my family or friends, but sometimes I feel like I'm holding people hostage in conversations. I feel like I need to get some stuff off my chest and I don't know how else to go about it. I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give. I don't really like having this need, and I hate feeling like I'm pushing my problems on other people (its really selfish and self-involved). I also feel it makes me incredibly vulnerable and makes me seem weak.

Do any of you experience the same thing? Do you have any suggestions to limit or completely stop the need to vent?  




 Yeah, this seems to be the main thing that I need to work on! 




 Tonight I was out with some friends and we were having a few drinks (definitely not helping the situation) and one of them asks me some questions about what I'm planning on doing when I go back to college next year. I felt like what they asked for was a pretty tall order because I've sort of been bouncing between a few different things ( the old do what you love or do what makes money thing) Anyway I felt like I went a little too in depth with my describing what I've been thinking about doing for school. 

That's just an example really, I don't go on long winded monologues but often times I feel like a conversation gets focused on me somehow or what I'm up to. I feel like the conversation is reciprocated but I feel foolish giving my opinions or input all the time. I don't know why it is but I feel other people don't open up as much as I do and when I give my opinion or add a relevant story to the conversation I end up feeling like I've said too much and it makes me feel unappealing and vulnerable.

Do any you have any suggestions for reining in how much personal input I give, or how much input is appropriate when I'm just bantering with people?
