 Yeah. A lot of my friends are in college too, and they are always complaining. It's like a slap in the face to me when they complain knowing they're living my dream. 




 Reading this has caused great anger throughout myself. I absolutely hate this sort of thing. If I paid for a service of faster delivery then damn it if this shit happens! Fuck you! It's basically, don't charge me for fresh ice cold Coca-Cola and give it to me warn and flat. You paid for hasty delivery, he could have at least pretended to give a damn. 




 I hate people that live in this apartment community. These people park behind vehicles blocking them in just to talk to some other asshole. If you aren't going anywhere, fucking park in one of the many empty spots.I'm either trying to leave or park near my building. FUCKING MOVE! Last night I attempted to leave and noticed someone not only parked their piece of shit car behind my car, they also cut it OFF and went inside their apartment! WTF is this BULLSHIT?! Some other jackass was parked across from that car facing it, basically doing the same thing. Blocking another car in. The difference was the second jackass was still in his vehicle. Parking lots are NOT social places! Fucking park in a designated spot! 




 It's impossible for me to agree with you more. 




 I have read enough crap on Reddit in general about people bitching about college. I'm tired of it. I wish I could go to college. Due to my financial situation, I can't afford college and federal aid won't pay for it because the formula doesn't take certain things into consideration. I have rent, a cell phone, a car note, utilities, car insurance, gas, and groceries. 

For those who might make the "cell phones are luxury" argument read ahead. Ten years ago, I would agree they were indeed a luxury. With the cost of cell service being lower than home phone service it's smarter to have cell service. Also, if I'm out and about and a potential employer calls, 9 times out of ten they skip on to the next applicant. I have to be easily reachable.

Before anyone mentions public transportation as a cheaper alternative to owning a vehicle. The area I live doesn't have public transportation. There aren't any city busses. No taxi service. Nothing. Also, the police are hardasses when it comes to walking anywhere without a sidewalk. There are very few sidewalks. Bike lanes don't exist here. Basically, the only option is to drive or never leave home unless you have a friend that'll taxi for you. All my friends live two+ hours away.

Back to the original rant.

People bitch and whine about going to college. These people don't realise the opportunity they have. These people don't realize how many people can't be in college that want to.  I'd love to go to college. I don't give a damn about mid terms and exams. I was born into a poor family which meant working hard to get a job that barely gets me by. I have to break my back to half way make ends meet. I'd love to have the opportunity to have a career in a field of my choosing and make more money working. Stop fucking whining about such a great opportunity. Fuck you and your ungrateful ass. Fuck F.A.F.S.A. for being so restricted and telling me that my family should help out financially. I'm fucking applying because my family CAN'T afford to help out. Why the fuck would I apply for F.A.F.S.A. if I could afford college? I hate that college is so damn expensive but is needed to get a decent paying wage.

That's all I have to say about that. 




 People. 




 I used to ride my bike all the time. I would ride down hill and stop my bike by placing the soles of my shoes flat on the spokes of front tire. Well one time, I did that and flipped forward over my bike. As a natural reaction, I extended my arms forward directly in front of my face. Both shoulders were sprained. That not only hurt but it was also pathetic and embarrassing trying to explain that to the doctor.
Edit: words. 




 I play a drinking game called "Last". Anyone playing must be standing. Everyone gets two shot glasses of liquor (preferably the same stuff for everyone). Everyone shoots the liquor at the same time and refills. Then repeat. Keep repeating until someone falls or quits. Then all the remaining participants add a third shot and continue repeating. For every quitter, add an extra shot per remaining person. The last player left only wins if he/she can drink the final round. I win every time.

For example: if the game starts with 6 people and each has 2 shots. One player quits = 3 shots(per player)/5 players. Another loser  = 4 shots (per player)/4 players. Next 5 shots per player with 3 players. Then 6 shots each for 2 players. When one of the two quits, the other is the potential winner. So the potential winner has to then consume 7 shots to be declared the winner.

This game gets its name for two reasons.

1. When people drink with me, it's the last game they wanna play.
2. You must drink the last round to be the winner.

Tl;dr: This game is for high tolerance drinkers. 




 A scientist uses a chemical he created along with subliminal messages to program citizens of a small town for mind control. 




 The first time I caught my parents doing the deed, I didn't realize that's what I caught them doing. I actually thought they were moving furniture. They were in the family computer room with the door shut and I heard them grunting and making noises. I knew nothing of sex and actually believed they were moving furniture. A couple years passed and I realised what had occurred. 




 I had the same issue... I was like "What's Final Fantasy have anyth... oh wait nevermind." 




 My problem is I'm a guy. Though I do cook quite well. I don't as much confuse myself with her as I confuse my right hand for Monica... 




 This reminds me of the time I went into a beginner's class for cooking. I went with a friend and he was actually a beginner. I am a professional chef with my own restaurant. Well, at first I impressed the teacher until my friend caught on and was doing better than me. It infuriated me. I wanted validation from the random stranger/teacher. My stupid friend got all the attention. My restaurant had gotten a bad review in the local newspaper. I brought this up and the teacher mentioned she loves my restaurant so I finally got my validation.

Edit: I just remembered that wasn't me, it was Monica on an episode of Friends. 




 I met my wife through her advertisement on craigslist. 




 If I have something to wake up for then I just don't go back to sleep. It's called being responsible for your obligations. Grow up and learn that life isn't meant to be wasted on sleep. Unless you're younger than 5 years old, you should have enough sense to know you can't just ignore life and go back to sleep. If you can't handle whatever it is you're waking up for, then you don't need/want it bad enough. I work 60+ hours a week and go to school 10 hours a week. I have a house to maintain and food that doesn't cook itself. I get about 4-5 hours of sleep per night sometimes less. I know to have a house to maintain and food to cook, I have to work as much as I do. If I want these things without having to work as much, I have to complete my education to have the higher paying position. If I'm late for work or school, I risk those things. I wake up and stay awake. I'm aware this won't be a popular post and not just for grammatical reasons. I'm simply expressing my thoughts as a response to the original question.

TL;DR: ranting about sleep. 




 This almost sounds like something I'd heard. Take a small towel and roll it up really tight with a condom inside but make sure the condom doesn't get twisted. Then, stretch the condom over the edges and go at it. 




 Just don't go with beer cans in a bath. Especially if it's because you can't handle the recent death of someone close to you. Then you'll try and offer one to someone who comes to check on you and you'll have to sip off multiple beers until you find one that isn't just bath water. You might then decide to have your brother fill the toilet with ice and fresh beers. 




 I would agree with you before they went with the natural cut fries.

 Cleveland, MS. There's just absolutely nothing to do here. You can stop through for gas, we've got that going for us 2.98/gallon. If you're going south, keep going until you reach Ridgeland.

 I'd support a draft in this situation. Hell, I'd be the first in line for voluntary draft if there were one. 




 Aaron Paul. He'd shoot someone then go back to meth and throw a non stop party to distract himself from it. 




 He isn't even good at being him. I hate him. 




 For those who want more Dr. Cox, watch ground floor. Though John C. McGinley isn't playing as Dr Cox, his character has a lot of the same traits. He even makes a few Scrubs like references. 




 Same here. That was a very emotional show. 




 When my dad and mom divorced and he met the woman who became my step mom, we all lived together (minus biological mom). I'll call step mom Charlene. Charlene worked from home and her employer paid for the internet connection. They also provided the 2 computers for the house. They had all the internet history monitored. They'd have screenshots of the history. She would get in lots of trouble if there was inappropriate content (porn) on the pcs. I was 17 so naturally I was a fiend. Since no tricks worked (incognito didn't work either) I would get playboys. I had a stash for them and all was good. Charlene always snooped around my room when I was at work. She found my stash and she and my dad had a talk with me. This pissed me off because I had urges and I wasn't risking her job, I had the decency to hide the mags and I wasn't getting any chicks pregnant. My playboys were harmless. I'm human dammit! 




 Grandmas and weed... oh the memories.
I remember growing up and going to grandma's trailer on the Mississippi gulf coast. We would go there as a family from New Orleans one or two weekends a month and stay the whole weekend. Her trailer had a very unique smell. I could never pinpoint it. All the adults would go to her room for a couple hours at a time. My siblings and I would hang out in the living room being kids and I would lay on the floor wondering what that wonderfully unique smell was. Fast forward to when I was 13 or 14 smoking weed for the first time and I got a big whiff and suddenly, I was at grandma's trailer. That smell brought me back instantly. Good times. 




 OP's name kinda gives this whole post new meaning 




 Promise to give it away. 




 I want to be used by a woman. Just for her to do everything (no backdoor usage). Like sit on my face while I eat her out. Get me close to coming then just stop. There's more details but I'll leave some for the imagination. I would also like the opposite. To dominate a woman and be very rough. These details are even more secretive. 




 My face doesn't get red. Though I think the equivalent of that for me occurs after about three fifths of Jameson. 




 Irish/ Italian/ German/ Norwegian and a few other nationalities reside in my blood line. I can out drink all of my friends and love potatoes/I love to eat pasta and I'm loud/ I also love to eat brat wurst and sauerkraut along with other German foods/ I'm tall with blonde hair and can grow a mean beard 




 He can even stand on a chair and check on all his patients at once. 




 He might get paged to work because he was on call. Then he'd be sent home for smelling like beer at work. 




 If a potential employer hands you a consent for release of background info and it doesn't say "criminal" background or anything similar, and you have criminal charges against you they won't find that stuff. A standard background check only looks for recent addresses and places of employment to verify what you put in the application. Most companies don't actually call previous employers anymore. If the form does ask about criminal charges and you have a pending charge, it either won't show up or they have to ignore it if it does because it's not a confirmed charge. The previous information is only good in certain areas. 




 If he's black and bald while dating a Latina nurse and they have a mutual nerdy white friend, he'll (the surgeon) somehow have plenty of free time for tomfoolery and steak night. He doesn't even have to carry a clip board all the time. 




 Just ask the guy that can get things for a rock hammer and a poster of a beautiful woman. Get in good with the guards by helping with tax tips and get in with the warden. Slowly but surely use the rock hammer to tunnel out while also setting up a fake identity associated with a bank account that all the warden's money goes to. Then fix up an old boat in Mexico. 




 Hell. It's not the least bit embarrassing. The fact that it was so simple and cheap along with it being something I could do by myself makes it a point of pride. I've had to replace the transmission on a previous vehicle for it to only last about 6 more months. That was a ridiculously expensive repair. I appreciate cheap simple repairs. 




 When someone complains that they work harder than anyone else when in reality they only want to acknowledge their own work. You might be doing the same amount of work or more but this type of person actually believes he/she is doing more and/or harder work.

Also, those who are ungrateful towards everyone. 




 I beat a dude's ass back in elementary for that shit. 




 This is me when I'm drunk.

 I took the front left tire off and looked at the brake caliper. There's supposed to be two bolts holding it to the rotor. The bottom one was missing which caused the thing to jamb up.

A little back story: A couple weeks back I had to replace the battery. On this make and model the battery is accessed from behind the wheel well. I had to remove the splash guard to get to it. Well the previous owner must've really fucked up the little plastic bolts that hold it together because I had to break some of them off too remove the splash guard. When I finished putting in the new battery, the splash guard couldn't be completely re-attached. About a week after that I had to replace the front brake pads. I did so and went about my business. Afterward, as I would ride around I'd hear this thumping sound and was worried but my wife suggested it was just the loose splash guard and bumper so I accepted that in hopes she was right. Then I ran into the problem I typed in my question above and was truly worried obviously. Well apparently I didn't tighten the bottom bolt mentioned earlier. So with running into the bigger issue I was able to fix both problems with one solution. I learned the thumping was the loose bolt allowed to much movement for the caliper which caused the thumping noise. When the bolt finally came out whenever/wherever it did caused the brake to jamb. I hope if anyone is unfortunate to have this problem, that they find this solution.
