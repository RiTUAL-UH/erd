 didnt think of that.. but no.. [It was released today.](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/thepeanutsmovie/#share) (and yeah yall can watch here)

maybe they want it at certain places so they can count viewers.. idk.. still seems dumb.
 




 Why don't we see mammals where there are 100 females to 1 male?

there are some gator pops, that might be heading this way due to the way temps select their sex.. too high and they are mostly female and their are worries that due to global warming, the pops will die out because the cooler temps needed to make males will no longer be available.
 




 and placebos?

never had a coincidence happen either.

its not that simple and no i dont think the victims are bigger liars than the perps.

you do know a lot of faith healers, have people PRETEND to be sick and disabled. FRIENDS OF THEIRS IN FRAUD. Others see the supposed healing from a 'man of god' and are fooled. That is FRAUD and yeah it helps if the people watching are ignorant of science but that doesnt make them morons.


 




 and google does the site search.. used them instead of reddits for ages.

just do reddit.com  search query in google for a site search.. no longer need to tell google to do a site search anymore either 














 and..... its gone.

WTF would fox remove an advertisement for fox on copyright grounds.

 




 fraud aside that wasnt the question.

there have been trans that deny they were ever a man to get laid.

quit pretending that doesnt happen.

oh wait you didnt? well the articles title isnt about that.

the articles title on if we should still recognize her as black.. if we recognize a trans.. EVEN TRANS WHO LIE AND SAY THEY WERE ALWAYS A GIRL.

**I agree with you on fraud and she has no right to fight historical opression as an insider, just wish you could have actually debated the question asked and not the one you seemed to want to debate.**

the question is, should she been seen as black, just like trans who lie about ever being a boy.

Lets put it this way, ignore her, what if bruce said he wanted to be seen as a black woman. Thats what i find is an interesting question.. not the bullshit about fraud and deceit that we all agree was fraud and deceit. But that point seems impossible to debate with the current situation because it all twists back into her actions which has nothing to do with the question.

 




 eh..  we are first on other lists.

different people use different methodologies and even the article displays 2 of them.. but yes the US is not #1 in either measure displayed in the article. 




 depends on how you define it.. it isnt easy to measure as you can imagine.

on  [household final consumption expenditure per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_household_final_consumption_expenditure_per_capita)  which is the most used figures.

Also mind you those are two different scales.. the one you are quoting is resources and things like emissions, as the article states. the one the title is quoting is land area.

see UAE is #1 when it comes to how much land would each person need if they consumed as much as UAE.

but Kuiwait is #1 when it comes to total consumption, which includes co2 emissions.. as the article states.


the US  is 4.1 on one scale.. the same one with the title.

and  3.9 on the scale you are comparing.

you do beat UAE in one but not the one the title is talking about, but the second measure at the second half of the article.

 




 apparently misc is the only place that will allow this discussion.
 









 yeah it kinda broke the fantasy for me a bit. people are dying left and right... to friends. the entire place is at war. Jamie at least is portrayed at having a little bit of brains.  i dont mind the death, as much as how it was done. its almost like they didnt finish their "homework' and just quickly wrote the scene right before it was filmed. i would have been happier with a tiny blow dart as shes rowing away.. trained monkeys or something else.
 




 I am glad he at least has a helmet in case he needs it.
 




 That one was a bit overly obvious, i thought, for the show. And for no one to be suspicious. Everyone thought it was her that sent the necklace threat. She has the poison troop. She doesnt even want to drink with the lannisters.. And suddenly she has to give her a massive and firm kiss to the lips? and in the world of deceit they live in... idk if a crazy person who seems like they hate me and sent a threat that they might have me killed.. suddenly kisses me.. i'd be a bit wary. 




 and they are about to get sued and lose, after spending millions to defend a losing suit.

yes both sides do it.. and i would like to see a study about how much we spend on these stupid laws that are nothing more than an expensive ass tax payers ad for the asshole who passed them. I am quite sure he was told by intelligent advisors that this law would not survive a scotus challenge but was probably also told that this would be good for him politically, both passing the law and when the law is challenged and he can scream about activists courts.

like my state is pouring money in the gay marriage fight, despite half the US lost that same fight before us.

Jindal knew he was lying through his teeth about the purpose.

Jindal also knows it is totally unconstitutional.

 




 what about multiple accounts from same IP?

do any of yall use phones?
 




 in this the document would be similar to the classified version of U.S. intelligence about Iraq and its purported weapons of mass destruction. Before Congress voted to give George W. Bush authority to invade Iraq in 2002, no more than six senators and a handful of House members bothered to look at a 92-page assessment of the alleged weapons kept in two vaults on Capitol Hill  something we know not because its public information because someone leaked it to the Washington Post in 2004.

well that assessment was also missing dissenting data.

and it would be better to actually point out that this is how it has been since the 70s for every single solitary trade agreement. not sure why nearly the entire media pretends this is new. Not saying dont get outraged. Its outrageous. but the fact it is a secret from the people.. is the same as the last trade agreement. And the only reason why Obama needs a vote for fast track, is because that authority only recently expired.(and yes i know fast track has more to do with congress.).

This is outrageous, but it isnt new or that modern of a phenom, especially when it comes to trade.
 




 how much you earn per day if i can ask. 




 well i also liked how they defended themselves by saying barbara can have a green lawn too

Im a conservative, so this is strange, but I defend Barbra Streisands right to have a green lawn, said Yuhas

"we arent total dicks, i mean we dont mind if rich liberals have green lawns too"
 




 combofix doesnt do 8.1 :(

/r/TronScript  is a decent script for cleaning systems.
 




 The margins arent that razor thin all the time. In my experience, walmart dictates to you what they are going to pay. They are very difficult to deal with and if you dont like it they wont carry your product. You generally HAVE to sell cheaper to walmart than you would to local smaller competition. 




 so a sub mostly about the past.

sigh.


there has been a lacking of content in recent years.
 




 they might have a case then. and i meant to post that to the post above this one.. oh wul.
 




 u can use reddit code, [you just got to say you are](http://www.redditblog.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html)

 The 21-year-old man, who has not been identified, had had his penis amputated three years ago to save his life after suffering gangrene from a botched circumcision. 

damn.. he decided for circumcision at 18? 









 Its generally not accepted at all, and if you see the people pushing the idea, you will find they are the same names that the denialist blogs promote and if you look they dont really have anything but conjecture behind their beliefs.


Like Anastasios Tsonis, says the current 'pause' in land surface temps is similar to one in the 70s, therefore we are entering a 50 year cooling phase.. despite that didnt happen in the 70s.

There is judith curry another famous denier, who simply says long term trends in ocean temps suggest we are heading to an ice age, without really expanding on that.

she also likes to promote the increase in area of sea ice, while totally ignoring the decrease in volume.  

now in the 70s when we had the famous newsweek article, actually most scientists at the time still believed in warming despite the media talking to the minority that didnt. But at  this time, most of the minority that didnt, werent denialist. See not only are we putting chems that cause warming, we are also putting up chems that cause cooling. And we werent as sure as now, at how all the pluses and minuses added up. But we still use the science of some of these people, because they gave us great data and research on the chems we are putting up that cool, like soot and SO2


 




 yeah you can brute force, but

but i remember thee 1st part of the password. 

sounds like pass might be long.. and while you can bruteforce only the part you dont know, probably easier to jog your memory.. it might take time and coming back to it. Try to remember everything about the day you passworded it.. All kinds of things form light connections to our memories, even a smell can bring it back.

had a file like op, took me a couple weeks to remember the pass, but just one day going through shit on my pc, it just popped in my head again. 




 well mind you the fast track vote rn is meaningless.. its a package deal with that thing that didnt pass.. .so people were free to vote for this or against, while planning to do the opposite when it is a real vote. This is sorta saying "if we get our way, this shit will pass, see look we will take a fake vote.. see it passed.. now give us our way" which pelosi wants highway funding.


some of fasttrack isnt wholly evil.. the parts that limit debate and time are, but congress shouldnt be allowed to amend.. it should be up or down vote.  They can vote to recommend.. but if you have 20 countries in diplomatic efforts, you cant have 20 legislative bodies, looking over the agreements and sending them back with minor changes that some minor portion of some 10,000 legislators want. Too many cooks and all that. They should be able to read it.. it should be public, they should be able to take all the time in the world to vote on it.. but up or down vote is the only way this shit can work.
 




 I do wonder if their is a son of sam out there being told to mow my lawn so i dont have to. There has to be the helpful insane.. no? 




 nothing says saint like an ostentatious display of wealth.
 




 i believe their algo takes that into account, when you downvote straight down someones profile.. the votes show up for you but not reddit. 




 fair enough, your correct, and my comment has been corrected. Thank you. 




 Well they [appear to be building nukes for the saudis...with the help of china](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Middle_East/article1557090.ece) and this isnt that new, its been going on for a [few years.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24823846)

and this on top of [starting the NK program and helping libya start theirs and iran in their renewed push](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/07/pakistani-generals-helped-sell-nuclear-secrets)

They pretty much are the nuclear black market.

I agree its mainly about keeping the government there, but its more about location than nukes. We might need to reassess the cost benefits of it all.
 




 if you look at things that were eventually released without the redacting, there doesnt seem to always be a lot of sense with redacting. Sometimes they just seem to do it to do it.

Here [is the martin luther king letter where the FBI urged him to kill himself](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/fbis-suicide-letter-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-and-dangers-unchecked-surveillance)

they cut out the worst of them calling him names, and cut out saying he doesnt actually believe in god, but then they say he is evil and urge him to kill himself without redacting.
 




 it would be hard to incorporate the language in the copyright code but something's have become so commonly linked into our history, that it really should automatically be open. It should be limited to things like this and happy birthday song.. but certain things just belong to all of us now.

Though i'm fairly sure you should be able to watch the speech in an educational context as the code stands now. 




 It might not be as significant as he states, but its a bit much to attack him with a "bullshit". A large part of the reasons people settled here was due to religion. Understanding things like why under god was put in our pledge. A def need a good understanding of religions in general to understand some of the strife around the world. I dont think it is as significant as some think, but he also just said 'basic understanding'  and well our history is replete with people using and abusing the bible, a basic knowledge of the book is most helpful in complete understanding of our history.(I'm an atheist but there is still a difference between use and abuse) 




 yeha i was going to expand into western versions, like the johnsons, and how people were also named after jobs like the smiths. i'd like to know how the actual transition period went, where we just stopped saying son of john, and just named them all johnson from then on, no matter the fathers actual name.


 




 thanks for the helpful correction. Many are not so helpful. I use the term a lot, and have been misspelling it for decades. LOL
 




 yeah i'm not even sure what he is countering.

'i dont think that will work and would be surprised if it did'

when i show him an example of it working. it could be culturally it wouldnt work here. but the facts are they take scummy people that are just as scummy as our scummy people and make them functioning members of society.  If we cant point to the cause, that is exceptional from america,then its idiotic to not try. 




 What works for Norway will likely not work here.

why? cause you said it wouldnt? Your comment might have validity if you said "just cause it works for norway doesnt mean it will work here"

but we cant know that unless we test these thigns right? SCIENCE, over EMOTION.

norway is a data point, they have better records than us, we need to get rid of the variables that DOES NOT CAUSE THIS. one fo the variables is their type of prison system.

I'd be surprised if it did.

And you probably shouldnt be involved in the science to see if it does. like it or not our system isnt working well. Their system is working better. Yes it could be culture, it could be a number of things, but only a moron wouldnt want to try it.


edit: [it does work in america.. we just dont do it wide spread, but the prisons that do have better rates than the prisons that dont.](http://static.nicic.gov/Library/023358.pdf)
 




 and you have validated my assumptions. Someone that corrects someone with a snarky dickhead comment, rather than anything of any use is probably a snarky dickhead who can be ignored. And looking at your comment history, i can see you offer pretty much nothing but dickheaddom to reddit. Congrats. You also forgot a comma.

and seriously look at his comment history, full of grammatical errors and you come here to be a dick to me.

Yeah, ok. Why don't you try reading a book about naval warfare and still think a "fleet" of Chinese pirate ships could even tackle a single Warship. I doubt it.

look at this mangel of a  sentence.

I guess you weren't

willing to take the mere seconds required to express their idea intelligently it is reasonable to ignore you

if you are going to be a massive dick about grammar, it helps to not have a comment history like yours, with crap like that. And all you do is attack people. You never offer any helpful corrections. You just scream everyone is ignorant but you while offering zero substance to back that up.



 




 tell me this. You got a mean dog and you want to make him a nice dog, which is better, treating the dog well or beating it? If you can understand that why cant you understand that treating people like scum, might produce scummier people when they get out?

in norway they have a program that has a much lower rate of recidivism than we do, and the place would make you puke. they are nice appartments and all the guards call the prisoners sir. They are treated like respectful members of society and the crazy thing, is it becomes habit and when they get out, they generally are respectful members of society.

they [have the lowest recidivism rate on the planet](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12)

we on the other hand, make it hard for them to ever come back to society, many cant get housing or a job, cant vote or go to college. And then we pretend they are faulty humans when they turn back to crime.

maybe we should dispense with emotions, and look at the science and actually try to do something effective, rather than something that makes us feel good,. 




 sorry in casual convo, people tend to get casual, if you want me to type this comment up in report form, it will be much cleaner, and grammatically correct. If you have trouble understanding any sentence, please inquire, and I will make it more clear for you.

Have a great day

!!!;,...:?"'  extra punct, so you can put them where you want them


edit:

people who post comments like this shouldnt be such dicks about grammar.

Yeah, ok. Why don't you try reading a book about naval warfare and still think a "fleet" of Chinese pirate ships could even tackle a single Warship. I doubt it.


**douchebag who makes grammar mistakes through out his comment history is only attacking my grammar because he cant debate my point.** 




 Its a biblical survey done by a christian group that has the goal of putting more religion in society. The poll seems done ok, but the conclusions are going to be a bit wack.

They are trying to show we are a bunch of heathens who forgot our bible and we need it back in the schools.  




 they didnt have last names persay.. from biblical info would be Noah ben Lamech. Or Noah son of lamech.

its where the bin names come from, like bin laden. Osama bin laden really is translated osama son of laden.


its how last names developed in the region. When you were in small tribes there wasnt really a need.. so you were just such and suchs son or son of such and such. It wasnt til we got larger societies that their was an actual need for last names. And jesus would be jesus ben joseph, which he seems to be referred to in jewish texts 




 Its a poll from a religious org about the bible and christianity's influence on society, they are going to be a bit non scientific. Real scientists in this area, complain a lot about the sudo religious science, because they are so heavily biased when they do things that they cant look at things objectively.

however this thing reads very political.

like that second quote of yours, its a true false question.. the fact that its below 48% should be concerning to them, because random guessing should product that, it sorta suggests that no one knew. Otherwise the small amount that actually knew would push that bias over 50%

and til yall are the mosiac generation.
 




 yeah, you'd thing that, but after literally millions of surveys, we have a very good idea about the numbers and types of people who wont answer or do fake answers. Turns out the snarkers are a relatively stable percent of humanity. 




 If france is successful..which it wont be but if it is, someone will just make an 'forgotten links' search engine.


much like the undelete subreddit here.  




 er

jet fuel cant dank bush.
 




 It isnt, People cant read. Which is quite odd for /r/science.


and there's a low score on the so-called healthy food availability index.

..among other things

but [if you look, the reason they added the extra qualifiers](http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/24/aje.kwr445.full) is because NO just being 1/4mile or more from a supermarket isnt very meaningful.

 Counting supermarkets is logistically more feasible but relies on the potentially incorrect assumption that only supermarkets offer healthy foods and that the availability and quality of foods offered by supermarkets are invariant across neighborhoods (1214). I


and right now the science is young on how to accurately measure all this.

 




 this is /r/science correct? There seems to be an entire slew of people who cant read.

 researchers defined food deserts as areas where distance to a supermarket exceeds a quarter-mile; the median household income is at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level; more than 30 percent of households lack a vehicle; **and there's a low score on the so-called healthy food availability index.**

SO NO, just being 1/4 mile from a supermarket doesnt count. The quality of your supermarket matters as well. The fact of 30% lacking vehicles is no big deal to us who bike ride and walk to the grocer but there is a slew of people, who have a high tendency to be impoverished that have a hard time with this, like the elderly.

i dont mean to be overly snarky, but i tend to try to be more exacting when commenting here... reread the article and such, to make sure what i say is supported. It keeps the value of this subreddit high.  




 they'd get more selling them on ebay 




 [he was tucking](https://vid.me/yOtY) 




 Sigh, wish i heard about this a while back.. i just bought two. one for me, and one for a friend.

Mine did the autofire thing before i even charged it the first time.

I sprayed down with electronics cleaner and got it to work again, after a more than thorough cleaning. hope helps some, i guess some juice might have gotten into it. but i really didnt have any real leaks, just the normal light film crap you sometimes get under the atomizer. hope this helps someone.. anyways you can get it at walmart in the auto section for about 5 dollars. 




 yes I would suspect that people who have a tendency to read articles on healthy diets would also show a similar drop. And i wouldnt expect the reading has much of a medical effect. 




 whats the story on the istick?
 




 you right to swing your arms ends at the tip of my nose.

and funny, i hear this all the time from you right wingers...... until you force single unwed mothers to post a list of their sexual partners in the paper in order to put her kid up for adoption.. cause jeb bush feels single mothers need public shamming.

yeah your all for privacy until it comes to poor people.. and automatic drug tests to get aid.. but god knows cant fucking drug test the bankers who are also getting welfare.

same people flipped the fuck out over Obamas under $250 anonymous donations, cry free speech over citizens united which allows unlimited anonymous donations, not just tiny 250 dollar chunks.

needless to say your pretty transparent.

and as for public shamming, there is a little lawsuit about what yall did to mann.

Also science is right or wrong, it doesnt give a flying fuck about your uneducated opinion.
 




 its highly unlikely that humanity will die out from agw. And really doesnt help to suggest that. Society will be greatly disrupted and dealing with climate change will be EXPONENTIALLY more expensive than mitigating it. but life will mostly go on.. there will be more conflicts and wars and year mostly poor people dying off. but with the wars and unrest a lot of the wealthy will die from agw causes.


but the world and mankind will go on.
 




 The GOP obviously.

A. only a moron would think the dems intended for federal exchanges to not get subsidies.

B. the supreme court wouldnt hear the case, had the GOP not brought it up. Its not proactive.

c. it would take one line to fix it and the gop wont.. they will insist on repealing the individual mandate. Which is basically repealing Obamacare.

Only a complete dumbass wouldnt blame the GOP on this clusterfuck. Had the GOP not acted, everyone would still get their subsidies. No matter what as the supreme court isnt proactive.

cause - effect

pretty fucking simple.. but i suspect you right wingers will cry

"show us one republican that voted for this mess"

lol  doesnt matter

yall sued to kill subsidies

yall are at fault


yall can blame the dems for aspects of the law people dont like.

the young dont like being forced on insurance. Small businesses hate the 1099 crap.

but if you think you will be able to blame the dems on yall killing the subsidies.. well I got a government closure and ted cruz for you to talk to. The dems didnt get blamed for that horse shit either.
 




 mildly cool you mean, separating all the things that can crash your entire browsing experience into separate processes so only the failing thing crashes rather than the entire browser and all tabs like in the olden days

[here read more on it.](http://www.howtogeek.com/124218/why-does-chrome-have-so-many-open-processes/)

it makes you safer somewhat from exploits as well.

 




 pure vg will be easier than a mix with pg. and if you look at some of the youtube reviews of the istick you will see others agree. Some people just are more sensitive to pg, especially at higher temps. You will see the same complaint as yours all across youtube. I felt the same.. i make my own juice, went to full vg, now i can 25wat no prob.. and often higher,. And i normally prefer a little pg for throat hit, until i started to higher watt and subohm.
 




 cheaper per month, which can be easier on the poor to own. 

However, that "cheaper' comes from the html title. ROI when new cars are cheaper than used ones. Which suggests he considered total cost of ownership.  But he doesnt go into it enough to say that directly. And the whole thing is based on a 1 year old used car. Which used to be the sweet spot for ROI. due to the massive drive off loss, which he suggests isnt quite there anymore due to cash for clunkers taking off so many used.

and he also makes the same comment as yours later,

If there's a general rule you can take away, it's a reminder of an old one: The real price of a purchase isn't just what's on the sticker. It's the full amount it's going to cost in actual cash flows over its lifetime.

 




 well this you see a lot at all levels of income. People dont plan for major downturns. I know often they can't. But even when they can, people just tend not to. your resteraunt is doing well, you kinda expect it to always do well.. lose a key chef, or a new interesting place moves in next store and and things slow down, you think it will pass, people are just interested in new but it stays slow and you find yourself in trouble. unfortunately then a lot of people turn to credit and get in real difficulty, it can be fairly cheap until you cant pay. 




 [when buying new is cheaper than buying used](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703921504576094264156257224) (wsj)

Edmunds.com, the auto-shopping website, now maintains an intriguing list of cars, SUVs and trucks where you could end up paying less per month for a brand-new model than if you bought a typical one-year-old used oneassuming you are buying the vehicle with a loan.

not only reliable but sometimes cheaper as well.

 




 it also costs a bit more to be poor. 

from transportation, to groceries, to laundry and financial services and credit.. and extremely expensive on time due to the same things above.  Having to ride the bus to do your laundry with its multiple stops, indirect routes and probably your stop leaves you walking still.. and then, having to sit there with your clothes.

I am not questioning your anecdote, i have known the same sorts myself, without a doubt it is one aspect of poverty. Just adding that poverty isnt the same as non poverty living.  and what some people might see as bad with money, isnt always. like shopping at the over priced convenience store because you cant make it to the grocery store.

 




 I agree with a lot of points.

Hear are some of my own. To many people seem to think freedom of speech means i have to listen to it or that it comes without condemnation. you are free to hate, and we are free to condemn you for it. Not that he meant it like that but when he said the thing about silencing people is denying your own right to hear.... well pretty sure the silencers, dont want to hear it anyways.. thats kinda the point.

his example on the guy denying the holocaust, i have no problem with people who deny all kinds of things. I dont think it should be banned. i'd rather know who they are. but in the same breath and to change to a less loaded subject, I dont think the time cube, or expanding earth theory should be taught in school.


its not silencing them to say they havent earned that soap box.
 




 I can agree and actually see some of myself in the article.

but one thing rubs at me a bit.. and though he had an awakening...

mainly because it seemed to me that liberals were exaggerating the case for global warming as a kind of secular Millenarianisman environmental apocalypse requiring drastic government action to save us from doomsday through countless regulations that would handcuff the economy and restrain capitalism, which I hold to be the greatest enemy of poverty. 

they never seem to explain why.. liberals want to do this. others might disagree with the regulations and things liberals want to do and have done.. and as a liberal i can say the same about conservatives, but neither has a goal of destroying the economy.

I always hear vague things about "control" and yes the government is infamous for passing and doing things that control us, but a carbon tax... equates to total control over society and the destruction of capitalism cause we feel like it?

(and on a side note, its kinda unfair that liberals get labeled the ones who want to regulate society, when conservatives want to regulate what you can put in your own body, who you can marry.. what poor people can eat.. talk about gun control? there is a town near me where YOU HAVE TO OWN A GUN.. its the law.. thats conservative government control.)

ugh.. ok dont want to get too political but it happens. he is right, there is also confirmation bias, and we all do it some. I try to stop myself but it happens. being a skeptic does help as we are more used to our 'feelings' being wrong.. time/space/sitting to close to the tv, the earth is spinning and yet we dont fly off... etc 




 it is cepr and this is based on good research but i do have a couple problems, or things that need more clarification. First it shows productivity in restaurants and grocery stores has been flat or down. Not exactly the bastions of automation.. and many people havent taken to self checkout yet.

also with the extreme amount of people needed assistance these days, you would expect that eating out, and buying hundreds of dollars in groceries is down. self checkouts or not. 

and our obesity growth actually stopped the past few years and went down for young kids, which would lead to a productivity stagnation in their examples.

also i wonder if they count the shift to online purchases, there are many grocery items people get from amazon now, in automated subscription services, this would lead to a decline in groccery productivity. If they dont count the non grocery stores online. Like I dont buy razor blades ever at the grocer anymore. Or batteries or a slew of items you get totally ripped off on if you buy there.

also the big problem with robots, is on the horizon, its easy to shift manual labor jobs or even force them to get skills to take skilled jobs, the problem is when robots start taking skilled jobs.

last the robots are taking some jobs. It might not be 'effecting' income disparity according to cepr. but capitalism has this supply and demand thing.. if there are far more jobs than applicants, the wages go up. Its econ 101, so if amazon wasnt putting so many robots in their warehouses, there would be more jobs needing fulfilling. now there can be other reasons why the data, comes out flat like it does.. or not showing a steady trend. Like as wages dont keep up with inflation, the rising productivity of robots isnt shown because of the declining buying power of the people. Or perhaps we are birthing people fast enough to make up with the declining jobs.

despite how it sounds, I dont totally discount what they say, i just would like an AMA with the dude who wrote it, because i have serious questions about his conclusions.


 




 goat in the water
 




 There is a physics prof vaper on youtube, that makes her own mods and crap. Shes pretty cool, she charges outside. i believe in an explosive safe container. 




 the quote is interesting considering it predates the changes to the pledge.
 




 with how much the right praised putin in attacks against obama, i thought he was going to be their presidential nominee.

Be wary of those who refuse any and all attempts at diplomacy. That believe all disputes must be fought with blood. that only increasingly hostile rhetoric will bring peace.. just like it does in bar fights.
 




 or do the opposite and post to /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces  




 How about we blame both congress and the executive(obama AND bush), since they are the ones who are supposed to have oversight over the admin and they passed many of the laws that the admins have been using for this power. And if they dont have the proper means to do PROPER oversight of the executive then that is a matter of discussion and a good time for it being election season.


I'm not sure why congress should be absolved when they keep passing these horseshit vague ass laws.. like the freedom act which isnt much different than the shit we had before. 




 look in autoruns.

also process explorer can help, you can pause the processes relaunching it. its not in tron but i have often used in infections to pause processes that protect each other by restarting when one or the other is killed. but its part of the sysnternals ms suite that autoruns came in.
 




 thanks, i didnt know the details that well, that is quite interesting. 




 Dunno about the UK. But in America, health codes and insurance. Someone might get sick and sue.

you dunno about america either.

If you go to a food bank, 90% of the food is unsold food from local groceries.

A LARGE PORTION IS PAST THE SELL BY DATE.

But we have been doing this for decades.

you get a fuck ton of stale bread and donuts, a fuck ton of lettuce and onions. and a fuck ton of cans of cream corn but that comes from people throwing that in the big cardboard box. whichs seems to be the only reason why they buy it. You get normal expired package food as well but a fuck ton of bread.


I dont think there are many legal issues for the stores.. and some tax write offs. but see they arent serving food, they are giving you prepackaged food. The food banks will warn people because so much of the food is after sale date(but there is leeway in the dates) to not eat it if it seems bad.

but yeah without the stores giving away the unsold food, many families ON FOOD STAMPS would go hungry. Food banks fill in the blanks for food stamps as well as help out families that just have a really bad month and we wouldnt survive without grocery stories. (used and volunteered at one for a long time)
 




 All but one of the these facilities is owned by for-profit entities, and by far the largest number of hospitals  20  are in Florida

figures, [their own governor ran a company that was convicted of the largest medicaid fraud in us history. They stole billions.](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/mar/03/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-rick-scott-oversaw-largest-medicare-fra/)

of course the CEO had no clue, his corp was bilking the government for billions.

wanna be a criminal? get rich first.

 




 I thought this was common knowledge.

happened to me 20 years ago, the price between insured care and uninsured was exponential.  I was told that the insurance companies make deals where i couldnt.
 




 well whats funny is the deniers demanded they be adjusted. you know heat islands and other problems.

then we do and they scream "LOOK YOU CHANGED THE DATA'

and remember the richard muller BEST study was to prove the data was bad. Instead it proved the opposite to muller.

It doesnt matter if you take adjusted data or not, the changes arent great enough to change the plot lines from showing mans influence.

it doesnt matter if you just take rural areas that havent changed in decades.. they all come out with graphs that are in great agreement with each other.

there is a reason why denialists have to argue from blogs and youtube videos.
 




 considering the rain they are getting now.. we can actually calculate that god is about 4 light years away.. well thats if prayers travel at the speed of light.

 18650 lithium-ion batteries

totally blows away AA rechargables. I have never been happy with headsets and flash lights using normal AA rechargeable batts.. they just never last or produce a lot of power.  18650s are awesome. Last long time, plenty of power.. survives lots of recharges. 




 I do the happy dance when i dont get invited to those things.... maybe i shouldnt do it in front of them though. 




 It was made very clear that anything that could be considered as marketing to children will have severe repercussions to the industry as a whole. 

I'd like to see the science behind the idea of "marketing to children".  It seems to me that at the most common ages to pick up habits like smoking(which for many it was to look older), could actually increase its appeal.

from my experience, at puberty ages, there can be a blowback against "childish things".. and "i'm too old for that"...and the same people will return to the nostalgia of those childish things when they get a bit older but between 16-23 or so, they avoid em. they have this need to be seen as an adult. and it feels good to bypass your age range, like to be able to see an r rated movie under 18. Everyone is how old to i look, wanting to look older.. they like to talk about their age as "nearly...the next age up" where the older you get the opposite sets in.

So I really wonder, since most start smoking in puberty i wonder how much cartoon advertising actually effected them.. positively to buy things. I'd rather be a marlboro man than a stupid cartoon camel.(i dont mind regulations so much, as long as they are based on science and not emotions, a lot of things we feel are true..like time/space... time feels shared and it just isnt.) There is a possibility that teens could see cigs/vaping as a definition of being an adult. Especially when you  force advertising to abandon anything that could be perceived as childish.. the exact same thing kids in puberty are doing as well.
 




 sorry but it does. AGW is as much chemistry as it is physics.

From how we tell how much co2 comes from man.

to the long chain molecule break down of oils

to the various other chems we put in the sky and how they work.


to calculating past sun spots.. we look at CHEMICAL changes here on earth.

and sorry but someone with the crappiest science degree on the planet, is going to no more about science and how science works and the scientific method, and stats, and how stats work, and how experimenting works, and how peer review works, over someone who graduated in theology. or most other non science degrees.

yeah it doesnt matter as he probably hasnt done any work in the field of AGW and his degree is limited, but I think he can actually read technical papers and understand them and in that case, it isnt irrelavent at all.

 




 sorry but someone with a science degree.. any science degree is going to understand the scientific method, and that the entire science of global warming didnt come from al gore.

Chemistry.. tell me my friend, the ozone layer,  does it effect AGW? what is destroying the ozone layer? what kind of process do we call that?

Also CO2 is one of the culprits of climate change. Why? Who might know things like the spectrum absorption properties of carbon? Who might operate a gas chromatograph.

no I doubt that hsi chemistry degree from 60 years ago, has anything to do with global warming...

but you do know the SCIENCE of global warming started with swedish chemist [Svante Arrhenius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius)

so sorry dude.

1. he is a scientists.

2. chemistry is vital in climate science.

3. all scientists are going to understand how science works and that it isnt a dart game that we all just vote on at the end of the year.



 




 I was once in an arcade, friend of mine about 8 feet away tossed me a quarter, i missed, and it flew right into the slot of the game i was trying to play. Sorry no picts 




 yeah but the good news, the multi billionaire koch brothers who put a full page ad calling for the food stamp cuts while simultaneously lobbying for more benefits under the farming bill, can take home a little more this year. I was really starting to worry about them after not getting their keystone pipeline.  /s
 




 Thats what encouraged this posting. Seems like he comes out all the time now.. and its worse because he's wrong. I bet like me you thought the game had updated and added a new factory, only to find out he is a lying bastard.
 




 perktv live/ perk swipe the best.. non passive.

pop quiz the best passive.
 




 a warning for what?

can we see a copy?

sorry to demand proof but there is a lot of BS constantly in the beermoney networks. people used to say you would get banned from bing if you cashed out from the same ip as you searched. In the nfo here, it said to not just watch app trailers or you might get banned. both total horseshit. So can i see the warning about perk pop quiz when you were totally within the terms of the TOS? (unless they changed it.. yes you can have 5 phones and run passively.. it would take 3 lines of code to prevent it) 




 can we see a copy of the email for ban reasons?

i find it more than hard to believe they would ban people for using their app within the terms of the TOS. Passively, so fucking what.. if they didnt want to allow people to do just that, all they need is a next button between questions.  crap even perktv they have "are you still watching".. nah if they wanted to stop passive behavior they could, there is zero reason to just ban people to do it. Crap have an 'are you still playing" every few hours.

So I am highly skeptical at these claims.


 




 cant they set a flag after you have upgraded factories that yes you know that you can upgrade them. and whats bad is all my factories are nano.. but my population is right at 150k.. so when it goes up or down, that dude comes out and says i can upgrade when i cant.

and yes I know I am low on simoleons and yes i know i can upgrade residences to earn more. 




 the left wing side of religion tends to be more accepting. They often(though not necessarily in this popes case) think you are still going to hell, its just not their business in stopping you. the right is the opposite, which is why athiests tend to be worst than muslims to them. 




 waiting til asked is fine.. the point to the ID is the 1099 law, that once they pay you over 600, they have to send you a 1099 and one to the irs. for taxes.

 




 yeah i have a trickle charger for the car i was going to see what it could do in full sun with cell charging. 




 every year 




 or like hedge fund managers who make an insane amount of money, simply hedging and taking percentages of others. They arent adding very much value to society even for those they work for, compared to compensation and they tend to pay the same tax rate as someone making 80k a year.. and sometimes less.

paulson who bet against the housing market right at teh crash, made 5 billion dollars, the most of anyone for 2008, he paid 15 percent on that.. where most ceos pay higher percent making less than 1/10 he did.
 




 your point about him not spending money, somehow making the dollar more valuable simply isnt true. We dont just minus him off the m2 data.
 




 at least a warning. Most large parking lots, especially healthcare areas.. like his ticket was from, where its kinda critical for people to get in in a hurry and less critical for them to get out in a hurry, they tend to have 'head in parking only'.  I wouldnt be surprised if that is common for all healthcare areas and not just here. 




 btw christians are chopping peoples parts off in africa, its just not as wildly reported. But Uganda, CAR, congo and other nations where people are often chopped up for being muslim or gay. 




 the opencandy sucks.

anime? eh, i'm going to have to disagree. I dont care how it dresses, just how it does the job. And sorry but in the past 35 years of computing, i have seen all kinds of retarded names and retarded designs..IDC as long as it gets the job done.

 




 NOPE AND NOPE and dont listen to the guy about flagging..

 using their software as intended will not get your banned.

I dont care how mania you are about it.

there is no scrutiny if you are following the rules.. dont care how big the redeams, or how fast, as long as it is possible under the rules.

Make sure they have your ID for tax reasons otherwise one day a reward will hang and wait for you to do just that.

ALLL THAT BEING SAID... its a good rule of thumb for all beermoney to cash out as quickly as possible.  Due to bannings, and project failures.. or hacks. But with that being said, i always cash out at 50 on perk wallet.
 




 You phones cost about  25 cents a year each.

Not saying dont use it.. u got it.. use it.. have fun..  just letting other perkers know, dont go out and get a dozen of these, you will be costing yourself more than its worth. rn.

 




 well it wasnt so much the method of communication as for the idiot with the camera. if the method of communication was compromised, we wouldnt declare it. to make them move and hope they get into a trap. Think enigma.. why didnt we just tell the germans 'hey we cracked your code" and hope they move to a different form of communication.

i do think the other asset on the ground is plausable though unlikely, it would be a major gift, if they happened to post a picture at the same time.

i think it more likely the fact that this is a rare occurrence made the info not very valuable. And making the enemy look incompetent, is more valuable. Someone wanting to join the big battle against america, might think twice that isis is their answer. 




 sarcasm.. yeah poe says you need a /s and he didnt include a /s
 




 making the enemy look like idiots can be more valuable.. and there probably hasnt been a rash of these, nor a rash to look forward to, so protecting this info isnt such a big deal. It would be different if every time they set up base they all took selfies. we wouldnt hear about that. 




 ALL religions have formed arround fictional chars.

unless you got a god in your pocket you can share with the crowd.

the point was the teacher... the prophet.. was real. or claimed to have been.. not someone in some far off heaven.

I still agree with you, that you dont need any reality to get people to follow.. NONE ZIP.. but the claim, isnt about the gods its about the teacher.(though it gets conflated with christanity as the teacher is a god)

 




 i beggining to think we are arguing different points..(and I am in your camp but i think i figured what they are saying)

 formed around and from him

I'm guessing they are saying jesus didnt have to be real.. because paul invented the religion.

not that it wasnt based on jesus and his teachings.

however I dont think that matters, since OP, was claiming "jesus is claimed to be real because people wont follow non existent teachers"(though muhammad tried just that.. it just didnt work out too well for him).. to me it doesnt matter if paul invented him or not.. paul is saying HE WAS A REAL PERSON.


with respect to OPs comment, not sure how people could form a religion that comes from jesus if he was imaginary. I mean jesus couldnt imagine himself into reality. meaning if it started with jesus... over paul well then of course jesus would be a real person. he started the religion. Since it DID start with paul, jesus still can be real or imagined.. but paul claimed he was real. So not sure what they are going on about, even if its not on the same ideas that we are going on about.


 




 but the christ in christianity...., lets put it this way, whose teachings did paul promote?
 




 No politician does anything 'for the good of the people.'

most, i would agree with you, but when you say NO.. then you are just in bullshit land. DO you think politicians arent people? Believe it or not some do do things for the people. Sorry dude but it is true. Yeah I am a pessimist too..and yeah corps have too much power, but you are going overboard.


This could be as simple Dems jumping off the teleco/cable train onto the tech train... but my guess is that it is probably worse than that.

dont be shy, expand.. what is YOUR GUESS.

and did you miss the two dems on the FCC split with weever and this was passed because the 2 republicans voted with weever. 3-2 AGAINST THE DEMS.

So please expand on how this is the dems jumping off teleco/cable and onto tech. when the dems opposed this and how this is "probably worse"


No politician does anything 'for the good of the people.'

yeah quoted twice, Strom thurmond(r) and I am very much a dem, actually personally helped me out after i got ran over by a drunk driver he got zero publicity. I saved over 80k but yeah. NO POLITICIAN EVER DID ANYTHING FOR ANYONE EVER FOR ANY ALTRUISTIC REASONS.

sorry dude they are shit, but they arent satan.

 




 no thats the opposite of what dude is doing.

I'm not here to suck Obamas dick, but nor am I hear to burn him at the stake for being worse than dick chenney. Its not complex.
 




 depends on the phone.. not all do that. 




 atm the opposite is more true, however wheeler has made it easier for competition to enter areas, so hopefully this will change. 




 actually yes, thanks obama, for appointing wheeler who turned out to not be satan and actually is doing great things for all of us. including this. See Mywifefoundmymain

 




 yeah i had similar experiences.

I emailed them once to get an idea of their user base for a debate here, and they sent me a trouble shooting form letter.

I sent another letter making fun, and got another unrelated form letter.

our CS might even be automated.
 




 well he had someone else in the car as well, so i would say no.. sounds like they are talking to someone else on the phone maybe.. but then say something assertively, followed by something else frantically. .. I'm guessing they got distracted by something. 




 not surprising with nations actually starting to talk about prosecuting deniers that know what the fuck they are doing.

we went after tobacco ceos under the rico act for constantly and knowingly lying about their own research findings into nicotine and addiction and cancer. Many of these mega corps went to the same one stop buy-a-fact-scientists heartland institute, who has never found a science it wont deny for a dollar.

I will say this, this subreddit and well all of /r/beermoney  has a long history of inventing reasons people got banned. I dont doubt there have been mistake and unfair bans and perhaps this is the cause of some of the crockery but there has definately been some crockery. heck they used to say you would get banned if you only watched funny commercials or only teh app trailers.

I seriously dont think they will ban people for using their apps, any way you can use their apps, without using other programs, and going beyond device limits. Meaning click what ever button, watch what ever video.. as long as you arent cheating through automation, or more devices, it would not only be retarded for them to care, it would be hard to design an accurate system, of banning people relaly cheating versus kids losing their phones behind theri beds while playing perk pop quiz and crap.

they arent going to ban you for using theri apps, 

5 phones per app, give them your id, no automation, no commercial skipping, upgrade when upgrades come(not an iron rule but a good one to follow) and you should be good. 




 yeah they are. And really its kinda a fact of life in business like this. Their CS on our side of the wall is going to suck balls. What do they care when such a small percentage of people they pay to.. have a problem.. they dont. CS on the advertisers side, is going to be stellar.  They will be able to ask about anything, dealing with ads.. sizes, codecs.. do they know how to convert into a form perk does like.. etc.. they are the perk income side.. our side is going to get a cursory glance and a form letter reply. Yeah they need us, but not individually.

 




 if you dont know the reference, it comes from france not backing us in the Iraqi war, and our congress making fun of france by renaming certain foods, like french fries to freedom fries.
 




 well not exactly the same since he is coming out as gay, not telling the audience to BE GAY.


if your dude said "hey guess what, turns out I love jesus" it would be more similar.

there is no gay agenda to make everyone gay.

and while I still think his speech wasnt appropriate, I dont think it is similar.

 




 and he should lose his diploma and rank.

The walmart daught just lost her diploma for cheating. 




 why it is true.. i would rather not have an establishment dem.
I also wonder about the iran/contra/bush/clinton links. The drug planes came out of arkansas.

But the media's portrayal of dems with issues against hilary.. its not as real as it sounds. AND I HAVE ISSUES WITH HILARY.


the [fact is her polling is pretty steady about  60%](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary)

and if you [go back and look at 2008]9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates)

Obama simply didnt have the same level of favorability in the dem party as Hilary is right now.
 














 on nice, that will work. 




 everyones been there. and it can all be hard to keep up with all.

you can get a cheap video card, i'd look for one with a hdmi out, but if just digital or vga you cna get a converter plug for a couple dollars.

you can also return the motherboard and opt for one with onboard video.. the former is better because you can upgrade the videocard when you have more money.

but yeah people here love pcs and combos, so post your ideas and you will get help and told what your missing before you buy.
 




 well since the mobo doesnt have onboard video.. did you get a video card as well?


you dont have anything to convert the hdmi into atm.

and in future, you can just post build plans here before purchase to make sure it will work for ya. 




 petitions are pretty much useless. If it is making them money, and not making them lose money(advertiser boycotts), its going to stay on the air.

and I dont mind these people exist, I just find it odd, that the land of freedom, cooking for 200+ years, has produced a society that doesnt smirk at these folks.

change the channel, like i do(before cord cutting anyways) when i see the 700 club on. Its kinda easy. Way easier than it used to be, you dont even have to get up anymore.

isnt that kinda the point? if it doesnt directly affect you, stfu and get on with your life.

i think just about every television preacher is a pure scam artist(hey some believe.. i can call him an idiot, not a scammer.) I'm offended but i would never demand they be taken off the air.. just off the learning channel :P (shows like it and channels like it)
 




 if the charger meets the specs it should work.

I'm betting the notebook has failed.

Did it run when you got it? and just now needs a charge?

if so the charger socket in the notebook is probably damaged. of caused by walking off with notebook while it is plugged in.

I have never had a universal charger not work, as long as all the specs are right, including the adaptor... but i do run into fucked up charging ports all the time.

If this is the case, then head on to youtube, search your model or google a dissembling manual. often you can see the damage on the power plug.. normally a connection has been broke.. pretty simple.., or a cap near by


 




 thats hola and thats a bit different. (fixed [link for the non mobile](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/37mmug/psa_stop_using_hola_vpn/))

Hola actually uses your computer and your bandwidth.

yeah they sell your data too. 

fsecure is also a very reputable antivirus corp/security corp.

their goal here, is for you to continue to use VPN after your 3 months is up, and pay them money for the privilege.

its not the same as hola and not the same as perm free VPNs and it is fsecure.. they fucking rock and have  since 1988. 

 




 I'm not.  This model isnt really that new. Its actually been tried and failed for the better part of 2 decades.

the problem is the kind of people you pay to watch ads arent the best kind of people to advertise to. Now thats not to say they dont spend money, but there are better targets than us beermoney folks.

I love to see them get bigger and better and last but its not quite the gold mine suggested.

BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE VOLUNTARY THING.. there was at least one game posted on reddit the other day, that had you watch an ad for several seconds of some power in the game. I found that to be rather unique. And I agree on phones being where the advertising is at.. just not that perk is more desirable or viable than tv, magazines.. etc.. yet..  of course I dont know what they charge and obviously they ARE GROWING.(that fact doesnt discount my previous comments, lots of pay to watch ad things grew in the late 90s, early 2000s only to die not long later)


 




 wireless g maxes at 54 and drops off quick.. 

your probably not going to see much difference from changing the wifi wavelength.. 2ghz.. yeah it can hold more data but real world says not a lot of speed difference.


5ghz doesnt play well with 2gz

wifi can be seen as an art form to get it all done well and playing well.

I suggest you repost to /r/techsupport  for better help than /r/perktv 

You dont need all that bandwidth and can save money by lowering it.

if you want to max out phones bandwidth.. which you DONT NEED as people have said.. you can get a rj45 adaptor that plugs into your phones OTG port.. and you can plug the phone WIRED into your router.. then phone will get as much speed as pc.

Its quite annoying that we lose hair were we want it and then it just starts coming out your nose and ears.. cant we transplant nose and ear cells to the top of my head to get some crazy fast growing hair?  I just havent found a good use decorative or not for my ear hair.
 




 I think some of that anthropogenic stuff is more than damaging to science. By far most of the quantum crockery out there has to deal with that unfortunate term. "observe" when interact with is much better. And i bet most who understand the term, first heard it like everyone else, especially if they found out about it young. That the universe 'changed' simply because human eyes were looking at it.... or a gods. Like I have heard, things only happen on other planets cause god's eyes sees things and quantum theory says reality doesnt exist without eyes to see. And people with the most elementary knowledge of it all.. might at least know that unusual claims about "observation" in science and so the crock story sounds truish.

you change from observation to interacts with anything and suddenly the crocks dont have it so easy. they will still be there but science wont be helping them, just due to unfortunate terminology. (and evolution reporting is way worse, you'd think every species had yearly meetings to decide how to evolve and with a lot of thought, the giant stink plant decided to smell like bad meat to attract flies which it knew liked the smell of bad meat.. and the plant doesnt even have a sense of smell.. or a brain.. but it decided)

i know we are human and its natural to anthropomorphize and sometimes good to help people understand things, but often it can be more than misleading. 




 hmm maybe it is only after a few articles, like many. It def comes up and grays out the text.. try 3 articles i bet thats all it is. 




 it is gallup who did the survey.. and sorry its just as scientific as every poll out there. We have a good understanding of the people who wont take surveys. 

And you know this is the same bullshit certain elements of the population use to refute all polls, despite they are well proven scientifically.


Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, nonresponse, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status (cellphone only/landline only/both, and cellphone mostly). Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population.

see thats why you see that crap at the end. they also have quotas for region and select based on the persons whose birthday was last in the house so they dont always get the most common phone users.

sorry dude, yeah i dont like it either, but that poll is accurate. And pray tell how else would you like us to judge? just ask you?


 




 small newspapers are a good bet.

here is South carolina's [the state.](http://www.thestate.com/news/local/military/article22708890.html)

pretty sure you have to del 3 elements.. i already got my filter perm set. but this is exactly what is described.. both the pop up and the annoying gray crap.

 




 it shouldnt, there is actually an option in ublock to leave the spot where the ad was, but by default that isnt enabled. By default it should work just like adblock just with more options in the options.

and less overhead.

ever go to a page and you cant scroll for a few seconds? thats normally abp blocking ads.. this is mainly what ublock fixes.

 




 for the 'you got to have an id to get cold medicine crowd', you'd think this would sell. But at last i suspect the same people will say making them have insurance is pure evil and against the second amendment when it says "A well REGULATED Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." 




 red herring, no where in the article do they claim insurance caused teh decline of accidents by itself.

and they tend to listen to neither, which is when government steps in and  tell them to add things like seat belts.. which people prefer not to wear, but the seat laws have actually saved us all money because there is a socialized cost to accidents.

at any rate, while I totally agree, insurance is not the sole cause for the decline in accidents while our roads have gotten busier and busier.. but do you contend that it doesnt help?

 




 why wouldnt this be allowed? its not an exploit? I dont think we have to check every app we download.. just things like frep. 




 42% of us citizens believe in a purely creationist view.


it gets worse.

only [19% believe in scientific evolution.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx)

partially because they get elected to office and scream evolution is just a theory and people see these high level people who dont believe and think thats just fine and dandy.

(yeah 50% believe in evolution, which a majority of those believing in god guided evolution, which is like saying you belive the mouse found the cheese but god gave him directions through the maze.. ie science doesnt actually exist..it doesnt work if you have an outside element that can violate the laws of the universe at will) 




 It also doesnt include their fav.. fines and fees. That also go up way faster than inflation.. and often disguises the true increase in costs. When I went to college one year not only did all the fines and fees go up and we added a new few.. but they shortened the max time on meter parking to make sure we all got more tickets.
 




 not so many R's up there.

 I think you know when the title says climate change it means AGW.

and I am sure they do as well when polled.


you see a very similar comment in /r/climateskeptics who get tired of being called deniers.. "we believe in climate change, just that man has nothing to do with it".. and they are just trying to befuddle the debate.

and looking at your comments on cap and trade and gore, makes me more than wary about your comment. and while I dont want this comment to branch off into politics, you do know we successfully cap and traded so2 and that al gore didnt invent it and wasnt the driving force behind pushing the idea.

 




 yeah but this isnt baylor, this is the [college of faith, which isnt even a school, its a church.](http://www.sbnation.com/longform/2015/2/18/8039515/college-of-faith-profile).. the ONLY POINT, is to inject religion into sports. Thats their point of existing.. is to evangelicalism in sports. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.. while i would totally agree and defend you 99% of the time, this isnt one of those times. 




 because you didnt learn.

What baffles me is you want us to say you learned biology when you didnt.


so what if you outperformed.. and you are still conflating the idea that your education had something to do with that and not your status.

The point is your friends who all out performed people at public school.. probably would have out performed them getting a proper education AT a public school.

the fact yall harp on this idea, without looking at what the science says is the cause, shows yall need more science education.

its the same shit that right wingers do when they look at crime reports for minorities. Yeah the science is true, problem is yalls interpretation.  Which proves you need more work in science.

and op said science diploma, not hs diploma and yeah it doesnt exist, but yeah if a college asked, it should be stated that you did NOT in fact learn the basics of biology. I dont care how bad that makes you feel. you didnt learn it. You fail. You dont get an A. Self esteem be damned. you didnt learn the subject. PERIOD.

 




 so you should get a diploma with zero knowledge of math, as long as you major in phys ed in college.

sorry your still wrong./

Besides a HS diploma from a christian school is actually probably a lot better than one from a shit inner city school where they just push students through.

and proving it time and time again, with yalls fake shit science.

here is some fake shit science right back at you.

I went to a private school.. as long as your parents paid, you got a B. Parents donated, you got an A.. I transferred to one of those POS 'inner city" schools and found out I actually had to do my homework and earn my grade. Does my one experience say anything about the true state of education? No? Nore does your horse shit unsupported science that wants to pretend the reasons why private schools do better has something to do with them and not other common factors.. like income 




 we have a basic skills test that if you fail, you dont graduate.

it doesnt matter if you PASSED every biology test. If you fail the final you dont graduate.

and yeah that includes specifics.

and colleges double check that shit when you apply. and will force you to relearn science if you dont know science.
 




 he didnt say HS diploma

and we mainly dont need to pass evolution basic skills test due to the rabid right wingers.

because evolution is basic to  a fuck ton of science, not just evolution.  




 first he didnt say HS diploma.. he said SCIENCE.

second you are wrong.

if you were taught, fucked up math all your life. 1 +2 = 4.. we should just pass you and say you knew math cause it wasnt your fault? We dont give out diplomas just to make you feel good. its supposed to represent what you know.

and its not a huge bad thing, you just should have to take HS science again in college. MUCH LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE BAD AT MATH HAVE TO TAKE HS MATH IN COLLEGE ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

as for the bullshit about intelligence, this is one of the reasons YOU NEED A REFRESHER ON SCIENCE. See you are ignoring all the other variables that also tend to come with home schooling. Like ECONOMIC STATUS. yeah kids that can eat well can study well. And kids whose parents can afford them things like chemistry sets, encyclopedias and nice computers, well they tend to do better as well. Your problem is your taking a single stat, and putting a cause to it, which is NOT SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED AT ALL.

and even if you do "come out more intelligent".. it doesnt fucking matter. If you dont know math, you dont know math, we shouldnt say YOU DO.. and if you dont know science you dont know science, we shouldnt say you do. I DONT GIVE A FUCK HOW KNOWLEDGEABLE you are in other areas.

**YOU FAIL AT SCIENCE, YOU SHOULD HAVE TO RETAKE REMEDIAL SCIENCE.**

it has nothing to do with being mean.. it doesnt matter it wasnt your fault. SORRY But thats the facts. Saying you know a subject or dont, has fucking shit to do with being mean to you.

 




 thanks and quality post.

reminds about code, gives  answer and shows the link 




 we just gutted our mental health funding.. got to pay for those losing gay marriage and abortion lawsuits.
 




 yeah part of the reduction is husband sending car back home after he gets to work.. but i think it will be much much higher. There will be less influence to take that first plunge, and so less influence to be addicted to owning your own vehicle. And without a driver, you gain privacy.. you can talk about the dirty crap your friends are into without worry.. you can listen to your own music as loud as you want. People love to buy kids cars for college, it makes you feel good, and that your child doesnt have to depend.. and wont be stuck.. BUT I WOULD FEEL SAFER with the robot cars. My kid wont drunk drive.. he will be safe. Why buy him a car? I'm getting him an uber robot cab card...

no maintenance, no insurance and you can get the car you need when you need, or pickup truck or suv, or w/e

lowes,and walmart will deliver, amazon will be dropping toilet paper off by drones.


and in major cities your going to see a 5 minute max cab time with robot cars... its not going to be a couple times a day.. its going to be when you want it... it will be there. Heck and it will be smart and start to just come before you even call it. It knows you like to go out on fridays at 8.. so it will have a car close at 8.


 




 idk, its odd, maybe credit card reform, its harder for under 21 to get one and they def want one.. maybe they just more used to problems with the under 21. There was a lot of this at myrtle.
 




 thats actually what his 'fleet' looks like. If you notice at teh start there are at least 2 of those vans with the exact same shitty spray paint job... i'm guessing the creepy dangerous ice cream van was the look he was going for. or looking at his route they might have been going for the "please dont rob the ice cream dude, look at how broke we are" look.

 




 they are starving the beast in the states as well.

my town cut mosquito control and cut funding to mental health right when they are struggling as it is. but we sure can always find money to throw at losing social problems. 




 Look i support the dudes that defend us.. and that get shot at so I dont have to. I even support the dudes that go to our wars of aggression, its not their fault.. but i have a huge problem with making them into special saints.

why is this soldier better than a 20 year old who works soup kitchens? I'm not thinking he would get a state wide appology

it shouldnt matter if you are rich or poor, a soldier or a hood rat. It is dangerous concept to think some people in society should be risen above the rules for everyone else. And yeah that includes me.. 


that said, if we feel our kids are old enough to go to war, there really isnt anything they arent old enough to do.

 









 it looks like they banned at least one dude for staying on 2.3

well he might have rolled back. He claimed the only other  suspicious app was a perk point tracker. Just an FYI for those who try to nickle and dime theri way to higher income. 




 me i changed my passes.

you can also disable auto updates in he playstore. 




 to keep working 




 I prefer [brain games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRo8TytvIDw)

Its actually based on science and not ideology.

 




 yeah thats the problem with bullshit, the well is infinite. You see the same in creationism, where as soon as you prove how one thing evolved, they simply shift the bar. not attacking you because they is the first thought that most should have on this debunking. 




 It does 'work', based on slight involuntary movements.. it can feel creepy, and people swear by it. to prove they are wrong blindfold the people playing. suddenly teh 'spirits' cant see. 




 and people say stopping one drop from a tub is meaningless.. 1 since drop isnt even an oz, and a tub is 50 gallons or more. Stopping a single drop is completely useless and meaningless.. right? drop after drop can over flow a tub, stopping drop after drop can prevent this.

Let me guess you dont believe in it anyways. Right? or you do believe man is the cause but man cant do anything about it. Am I correct? or pray tell, what is yoru solutions besides drill baby drill? all we hear from right wingers is what is the wrong ideas, and the only ideas they offer of theri own, is increasing the us of carbon and cutting taxes for the richest of us. Thats it. nothing ever else but complaints.
 




 and beeno for cows will be invented. 




 what a crap article.

You can guess the coming spin from Team Hillary: U.S. military exports have been booming under Obama for years, and not just to Clinton Foundation donors. Theres an Obama arms bazaar going on, said one arms-control expert back in 2011. The next year, Obama set a record for weapons shipments to the Middle East. The year after that, after Hillary had left State, he relaxed military export controls further by shifting some of States duties to approve weapons deals over to the Commerce Department, which could be more flexible in approving sales to nations with dubious human-rights records. After adjusting for inflation, wrote arms-control wonk William Hartung last month, the volume of major deals concluded by the Obama administration in its first five years exceeds the amount approved by the Bush administration in its full eight years in office by nearly $30 billion. 


'you can hear hilary now, muttering the truth about how this has gone on before and after her"

well yeah.. thats what I would do when someone makes a  horse shit accusation

also there is a bit of trouble discussing teh volume of arms sales .. when talking in DOLLARS, 10 years after another comparison. Unless those dollars are adjusted for inflation, its a horse shit comparison.. just like "larges budget ever'  thats shits going to happen, in a country with an ever growing economy, and growing population.

anyways horse shit article.

plenty to dislike about hilary, still the entire right wing field is like hilary on steroids... but you have to wonder why the right love to live in bullshit land, rather than find legitimate problems.
 




 they are a well dedicated and very loud army and far more organized than the GOP.. which i know is hard to believe but it is true. They are just a much smaller group. but part of you downvote problem is reddit started off as a libertarian homeland before the /r/politics "shifted left"(no where but the US would /r/politics be considered left but hey thats where most of us are, so i accept the claim)

but yeah we both will be downvoted to hell.. even my comments pointing out that the email problem isnt a hilary problem but a government one.. Or my comment showing that 60% of dems voted against the patriot act. you would think that private loving libertarians would acknowledge and praise that.. and maybe do what i do and then point out why you dont like their policies like i do with libertarians but no they just downvote and deny.
 




 I like his stance on privacy and war.... which are both liberal ideals(sorry just look at voting history)

but he always wears an R?  Its dems alll over hte country legalizing, fighting the GOP the whole way. it is dems who dont want boots on the ground, fighting the gop the whole way.. AND IT WAS DEMS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE PATRIOT ACT.. AND AGAINST OBAMAS REQUEST TO RENEW IT.. and fighting the gop the entire way

and yet this guy wears an R on his sleave

its almost like he doesnt care about all those things he runs on.

its almost like his main cares are low taxes and low regulation which are the forte of the GOP.

but he always runs on pot, anti war, and anti spying WHICH IS THE LIBERAL ARM OF LIBERTARIANS.
 




 actually the MAJORITY of dems voted against extending the patriot act UNDER OBAMA.

how [can yall love privacy and not know that 60% of dems voted against renewing it under Obama and it only passed because 60% of right wingers voted for it.]9http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/376)

infact you seem to believe the OPPOSITE OF REALITY.
 




 really? really? and this guy got this main upvotes? disappointed in this sub. One it shows how hyper libertarian biased yall are, despite there is a dem fighting for privacy rights.

Nothing hilary did was unusual or against the law.

the federal records act was never properly updated for modern times.

The people in government are ALLOWED to use theri own servers.

the people in government only have to back up government business.

THE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT WITH THE EMAIL ARE THE SOLE ARBITRATORS ON WHAT IS GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

it is why the irs was missing emails, [but is is also why bush and chenney, who ran their email through RNC headquarters was also missing his emails.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy)

and why bill clinton and gore were missing emails.

it has to do with a fucked up law.. and absolutely nothing at all to do with hilary or left or right.


Seriously drop the hyper bias your ruining the point to this subreddit. Want to be political go to /r/libertarian /r/conservatives /r/progressives or /r/politics 


keep that shit out of here or fuck this place

now notice.. i pointed out from BOTH SIDES.

And[ if you want a clue about the real problem.. read this](http://www.zdnet.com/article/irs-scandal-ludicrous-claims-about-missing-government-emails-been-there-done-that/)

because only knowing the REAL PROBLEM.. can you effect change.. pretending the problem is with one single indivual who if they dont get in gov then the problem isnt there.. is just plain ignorant and yall upvoted the fuck out of ignorance.

yeah the place is fucked but the law is what needs changing. 


**YOU NEED TO KNOW REALITY TO CHANGE IT AND THE REALITY IS IT IS THE LAW, NOT HILARY.**

but I am quite sure the ignos will downvote this bipartisan proof that this is a fact. And show how totally worthless this subreddit is, if it is just going to be a campaign headquarters for rand and ignore all the other people who arent rand who are also fighting for privacy.


 




 [BoOOoOoo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/f3/5c/65f35c1d022f81091b532a7a181cc97e.jpg) 




 my crappy zingers which i have been using for a longer period.. dont have any burn. Dont know why the moto-s do, but they are also refurbs so they might be pretty old.

and it is a great idea to run these phones dimmed and with as little else running... I had been but when i upgraded to loli i didnt put them dim again.
 




 these were the befrugals.. got them for only  $5 and with referals, I was basically paid to keep the phones. They are nice as hell. Never crash on quiz, very skippy.. but of course the burn problem.
 




 well on the 2 of mine that have it reboots do nothing.

1 that is really bad, i left off for days. it gets a bit warmer than the rest.. dont know if that could make the burn in last longer. But nope that didnt work for me. And if you look at the links in my other comments you will see that doesnt work for a lot of people.. hence the apps.

but thats for the advice, turning it off and on again.. its almost like the first rule of IT.  :P


 




 Tried a few burn in apps. Burn fix seems good as you can take a picture of what burned you and invert it and use that as part of the fix..

but easier seems to be to invert the colors in android settings and just running the app that burned you.


also, turning down brightness and contrast will help the burn.. and battery life.
 




 nope they do.

there are plenty of screen burn fix apps.

i can see the panda and a list of answers to the quiz and the spinning circle.

[other people claim the same as me](http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoG/comments/2d3b7q/motog_screen_burn/).. and other people claim the same as you.

but nope this is pretty strong burn.

and the fact is, no matter what anyone says, AMOLED does burn.. [here is a video of screen burn on an AMOLED.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h98u1DzuS8)


and [here is a picture of the burn in.. i got rid of the panda mostly using an inverted panda.. going to invert the question list and spinning donut to get rid of the rest.](http://i.imgur.com/xSSY9OG.jpg)

so this is proof positive that what people hear about amoled, is full of shit. It is MUCH HARDER TO BURN but the fucker does burn :P


and [more on AMOLED burn in.. seems to be the samsung version is causing th most issues.](http://www.recovery-android.com/screen-burn-in-of-your-android-smartphone-fixed.html)

 




 I guess you know you perk too much when you can see the panda on dark scenes in movies and apps. My moto gs starting to develop burn from the perk quiz. 









 they had to the gap was too big when they took out the two women. 














 not easily.. I mean you could set up different account for each.. or run one at a time.

or use network monitors and monitor the video gets.

you coudl set them all to say funny videos.. as simultaneously as possible and then monitor bandwidth.. after an hour you should be able to tell which ones are a bit slower.

but basically your asking someone to build a system which hasnt been built yet.. so there are no options just ideas that havent been realized yet.
