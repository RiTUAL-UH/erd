 Ditto for NYC subways as well 









 I have a hard time believing this type of drug would sell well in NY, especially in Meatpacking.  Most people out here love blow, molly, drugs that cost $. Krokodil is poor man's shit, gives you a dirty high.   




 I'm a minority, been called every name in the book.  Do I give a fuck?  No.  Should you either?  No.  I can't tell you what to do, but if this sort of stuff gets to you then you need to toughen up.  Sorry to put it this way, but your living in "their" neighborhood.  Most of us are temporary residents of NYC, after 5-10 years we leave.  These guys are lifers, they're not going anywhere, so get used to this shit.   




 If he comes back in the post season, we're lucky.  Other wise, I wouldn't expect much 




 Look I get it, drivers can be ruthless.  I drive everyday in this city and try not to block the box, but when you need to move out of on coming traffic there's not much you can do.  The car in front can move as much as possible, but the Times Sq area is a cluster.  Unless you have driven that area, its almost impossible not to break laws.    




 Cheers, I've used that one as well as firstrowsports, but wanted the HD viewing this go around 




 I live on the East Coast and don't have cable/satellite, but I saw that League Pass is offered thru Apple TV.  Has anyone ever tried that route?  I heard years back it was a clusterfuck, any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.   




 Brooklyn kitchen offers awesome classes such as doughnut making, pizza and pasta, and legit Japanese  




 We need an identity whether on D, or the run game. Tonight it comes out 




 What's happening with our O line?  It's as if they took a step back this year.   There needs to be more accountability

 The flip side is most of the people that come to NYC only stay for a few years, maybe 10 tops.  Although there is a constant rotation of in/ out, the native folks get the short end.  

I told this to someone earlier, although I may claim NY as my home, home is really the people that have roots here.  Those folks likely won't be leaving this city, and it's not by choice.  This realization made me become way more tolerant of this city and of the people.  .

 




 This past week, there's been 2 Alex Smith threads.  I wish the mods could regulate this more, it's ridiculous to even mention him this season.   




 Looks like some good yay being passed around 




 B/C there's a bunch of Alex Smith fanboys that are dying to talk shit 




 Sushi of Gari is pretty good 




 Wonder if this is also the Super Bowl hangover 




 It's useless, so many Smith fanboys trolling.   




 shady transactions go down nightly in this city, i really doubt there's a website to bust out people  




 Remember it's a whole season, and my gut tells me there is a whole arsenal of the "O" coming.  We're only on Chapter 1.   




 It's not even like that.  You got a QB out there (Kap) bustin his tail and one of top threads I see is a request for Alex Smith's wins.  That's classless.  Why not put a countdown, for Aldon Smith for single season sack record?  A player that's actually on our team.  

The fact that thread got upvoted is ridiculous.  This summer alone I saw 4 Smith threads, which shows fans aren't over it still.  In fact, 1 Redditor even made the claim, "Alex Smith is still one of us"  
I question the Smith fans. Straight UP.   




 This might not be the best comparison, but this reminds of how Miami used to play New England when the Pats were at their best.  Miami just played them physical and had their # a bunch of times.  I see a similar trend with the Rams as well.  Both the Rams and Hawks will always be a challenge to us.   




 This is a 49ers sub reddit.  If you really feel that it's necessary to put up a ex teammates win column, go make your own sub reddit.  It's classless IMO.  




 I asked this b.c something similar happened to my friend in CA.  We thought he would be able to sue, but the insurance comp advised against it because he wasn't hurt.   




 Poor planning on the restaurants part.  Bad on them for not realizing the type of clientele they were serving.   




 Just curious, what charges are you going to be pressing other than to cover the paint job? 




 Are you going to a actual HTC?  If not, you need to go asap.  Don't bother with the local hospitals with matters like this 




 So a couple years back I talked to this guy who used to frequent Ibiza alot.  He said in Europe, people roll but never to the point of being on the floor and needing to be taken care of.  He noticed how in America, the young ravers would go overboard with their consumption.  

The whole point of X was a dancing drug, not be all fucked up and looking like you're possessed.  
 




 Sorry fellas, won't be able to do a meet up tonite.  But now that I know there's a few NYC folks here, let's do Finnerty's soon!   




 not so fast Tonto 




 My guess is thr meatpacking district  




 NYC Reddit 49er meetup this Thursday?   




 Even though you probably won't be able to get in, the Barclays Center is worth seeing.   




 These days I see/hear mostly Italian and French being spoken around Bedford, and they're usually middle aged residents, not tourists.   




 Welcome to NYC, if you haven't already check out [Finnerty's](http://www.finnertysnyc.com/) on 2nd Ave East Village.   




 Try peeling the bottom stems of asparagus, you won't get that gritty chewy fiber when you bite into it.  Nice looking dinner 




 The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn t exist.  And like that, he's gone.  

-Usual suspects 




 hope you ate it with the shiso leaf 




 Glad you brought this up.  As fans were a mirror of the organization.   




 The farmers that grow it are against it as well.  As much as I'm for legalizing it, it puts a lot of the growers out of work.  There's tons of people up in the Emerald Triangle Nor Cal that have been growing for years.   









 It's a fine, non negotiable.  You run the risk of prolonging this whole ordeal by fighting it.  Hundreds of these tickets are issued everyday, its a in+out deal.  Unless you have evidence pointing otherwise, what makes you think you can fight it, or lessen the charge?   




 Buttermilk ranch is crackalicious also 




 One of the best and most legit Carnitas posts on here.  Kudos

 This coming Aug, my family has decided to do a Yosemite trip.  My 2 biggest concerns is my 4 y.o nephew, and mom who can walk but not much (1-2 hours tops)

That being said, can people recommend reasonable hikes and places to check out without it being too strenuous.  Also, what are some good hotels within a 45 min drive outside of Yosemite?  It seems as though most are inside (all booked) our they're super far like 1 hr 30 min (Oakhurst, Coarsegold). Is there something in between?   




 Try mixing this with a splash of sesame oil, bunch of green onions, and soy sauce till paste gets to a sauce consistency.  Great for grilling chicken, lettuce wraps, etc 




 The wife is Japanese, this couldn't have been more spot on.  My personal fav is the time she tried spelling guacamole.  Came out Wakamole

 As much as I appreciate his strength, at the end of the day it's a dance.  Too many bboys these days are all about the powermoves and have lost the basic footwork.  I might be biased because I'm Japanese, but I dig this [guy]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSpsvX829EI).   




 Beans and rice, basic salad and add cilantro 




 Klay IMO hasn't deserved the automatic green light, and at times he"ll shoot us into or out of a game.  I'm sure this summer he's working his arsenal or new shots.  But in the meantime,  coming off the bench would give him the confidence 




 But there could still be a sign+trade with Iggy and Bogut.  I have a feeling our F.O is up to something big 




 Damn is Barnes all but gone?   




 Barnes post game on the low block looked eerily familiar to Kobe's.  And yes, I would be pissed if we lose Barnes to LA and Kobe takes him under his wing and grooms him to be a superstar 









 wonder if this is the same [guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded v=ffDPTKn7HiY#at=58)

 Well put, but easier said than done.  Especially when you grow up around hood life and do gangster shit, your associates are still bad influences.   




 I came across this [list](http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=107 pid=33 gid=000076) 




 My friend David teaches Kung fu at Columbus park.  7 Am weekdays, 8 am weekends.  Go towards the back of the park across from the police station.  Its pay what you can.  I'll prob start going back now that its warm.  Inbox me for more details.  He's a awesome teacher 




 did you really post your IQ???  hey i know, lets have a spelling contest!  better yet, lets see who can type faster.  jeesus you must be Internet Tough Guy of the year.  now go back to your mom's basement.  we'll be waiting for your next fuckin pathetic response.  dying to hear what you got to say  




 he's a dumbshit, anyone that tries to flex their IQ and claim they made money of their "football IQ" is a fucking moron.  your response was well written, better than how I would've put it.   




 you ever try soaking the corn in water before grilling?  read somewhere it gets the corn even juicier 




 Couldn't agree more.  There are sushi restaurants that have lost clientele because the chef has left.  It's because the chef had a following, and they were consistent in taste, service, etc.  




 So a quick story to share.  Hanging out in the e. village, and a buddy of mine had to go to BofA to withdraw cash.  This was on a weekday early afternoon.  

Ahead in line were a couple of young grungy looking kids, no big deal.  They leave, and we're up next.  Both kids leave their ATM receipt behind.  Curious me goes and picks up their receipt to peak.  Low and behold both kids savings account was over 400K.  Now I'm not generalizing that all young cats in NY are trust fund kids, but that day confirmed just the ridiculous amount of wealth that people in NY are running around with.   




 Why the fuck are you this board?  Are you a fan?  See it's fans like yourself that post messages above that display zero knowledge of the game.  The fact you're hung up on him thinking he lost us the game shows your a newbie.  GTFO 




 There was a cyclist in Britain that almost qualified [Alex Dowsett](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/olympics/4356058/Alex-Dowsett-has-beaten-a-bleeding-condition-to-compete-for-Olympic-cycling-slot.html)   




 Thanks guys I'll let you know what I come up with.  Might try to be Rasputtin! 




 Hey guys+gals, the California camp is coming up next week and I'm desperately in need of a costume idea.  The theme we are incorporating this year is Hereo's.  It can be whatever you'd like it to be, but I was hoping to incorporate some kind of hemophilia twist to it.  Any ideas, suggestions?   




 Like to see this guy's opinion on what he thinks are the best bars 




 He's a defensive genius.  Took the hornets and made them a solid defensive team, made the cavs a lot more respectable.  No coincidence the warriors D got way better te last 2 years  




 Next time add some Guiness instead of water.  The bitterness takes the edge of the saltiness, and the alcohol makes the corn beef super tender 




 My dad sometimes will take some strips and will char it over the stove for a few seconds.  Also, some bars will serve with Kewpie Japanese Mayo as a dipping sauce.   




 Blue Owl also has great live jazz on Sundays, as well as awesome hip hop on Thurs.   




 Start smoking pot 









 La Quinta INN Hotel, in Ktown.  You get a great view of the Empire State, big patio and good priced drinks.  Plus you can get smashed and bomb on some Korean BBQ after.  




 Instead of forking over 20.00 for the Empire, go to La Quita in on West 32nd St Koreatown.  Awesome rooftop bar that sits directly next to the Empire State so you can see pretty well.   




 Upon landing in Oakland, you get welcomed with a nice fat joint.  And then the plane would do a side show on the run way 




 It's a double edged sword with Lee.  In all his years, whenever he's forced to play center, he doesn't do well match up wise and #'s wise.  However, stick a center next to him and he flourishes.  Less pressure off him to perform, plays decent weakside D, and gobbles tons of boards due to the Center boxing out.  I still think you keep him next year, but wouldn't be surprised if we trade mid way next year, especially if we're not doing good as a team 




 yeah it's a weird japanese veggie thing.  my aunt does the same every morning with a salad of some sort.   




 I can go with porridge and fish, but natto has always been too hardcore for me.   




 this team reminds me of how OKC grew up right before our eyes.  they built a team thru a solid draft as well, and had a few tough years in the playoffs before fully blossoming 




 Each time I open these "meals from around the world" it's been totally inaccurate.  Japanese do not eat tofu regularly for breakfast.   




 Oh lemme clarify, an Alex Smith homer.  Are you a fan of this team?  Because the way you criticize Kaep and Harbs, why the fuck are you on this message board?  Stick by team thick and thin..But wait, a newbie such as yourself, you wouldn't know that.  

You display zero knowledge of the game, and it's obvious you can't get enough of Alex's dick.  Wait till week 3 next year when Alexis will be getting booed off the field.  I'll be waiting to hear your excuse then.  "Oh it's because the Chiefs have no O line, he has no weapons"  GTFO kid 




 So in other words, you know more than Harbaugh.  Yeah chew on that 




 Ball don't lie.  Don't be so quick to jump at #'s, they don't mean shit, especially in a game that counts i.e Championship Game (down by 2 TD's) or going into New England and outgunning Tom Brady.  

The fact your still hung up on thinking Kap lost the game shows your pretty blinded and homer.   




 There was a similar story I read a year ago about a chinese guy that kept his dead gf in his apt well after she passed.  He even blogged about it I believe and posted pics.  Her pic was way more disturbing 




 its shiso leaf, one of the most underrated herbs imo.  if it's available in your area, highly recommend 




 It's called HDR Camera, you can find it in the play store.   




 thanks...there's actually a pretty cool HD camera app for samsung galaxy that works remarkably well 




 it's what he wanted as his going away party.  i told him he didn't have to, but its his way of saying goodbte 




 eesh i wish!  pretty tough to find thesedays 




 if they are anything like air burgers, i can relate.  they suck as well 




 this is why comments above irk me on this subreddit.  people are dogging the inari pic simply because of a tiny condiment which wasn't even squeezed onto the piece.  

folks are so quick to dismiss/disect anything that they don't feel is legit, when in fact the chef was born n raised in japan and made everything from scratch.   




 yeah he's a minimalist, lets the ingredients do the talking 




 NYC, but both chef and I are from Japan 




 im not following your drift. source:japanese as well 




 Good queston.  He trained a little in Japan, then while going to art school in Philly he worked at a few different joints.  But then his art really took off and stopped cooking.  

The last 3 years in NYC whenever he had free time we would get together and have these massive feasts.  His art work is just as amazing, and it shows whenever he makes food.  Inserting shameless plug [here](http://tadashimoriyama.com/) for his work 




 No worries, after 3 shots of whiskey, it dawned on me that aerial view was the way to go.   




 You are spot on about a quality rice cooker.  My wife and I dropped 300.00 on a bad ass rice cooker in Japan.  Granted this thing has tons of functions, (induction heating, slow cooker, porridge, etc) but it was shocking to see how crazy in price these things get.  

On the hother hand, my mother in law is old school and uses a pressure cooker.  Her rice always is perfectly cooked.   




 Store bought unagi, you can find it at the asian market.  Forewarning that there is a major Unagi shortage happening around the world, and the price has skyrocketed.  This past winter in Japan, I paid close to 40 bucks for a unagi bento.  Granted it was wild, and delicious, but still bank 




 Sadly this will be one of my final meals from him, since he's moving cross country.   




 I'll start from the top row, left to right.  

Unagi (bbq eal), Inari (fried tofu pouches) stuffed with Shrimp

Cucumber roll stuffed with salmon, shrimp, salmon roe

Avocado Roll, Octopus nigiri, California Roll, Squid Nigiri

Cucumber Roll 




 One thing I've learned in my years browsing reddit.."never stick your dick in crazy" 









 It's soba noodles, pretty un typical for Japanese.  The rolls however are legit.  Sorry that's all the shots we had 




 Sashimi in the pic= Salmon, Yellowfin Tuna, Hamachi, Tuna tartare with green scallion  

Veggies= Shiso leaf, avocado, cucumber
