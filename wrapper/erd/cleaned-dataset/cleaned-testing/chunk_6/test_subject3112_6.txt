 most likely gallery items

**Holy fucking nope, Batman.**  If I lost my gallery I would be inconsolable.  That is like the one thing I've put most of my efforts on.  What the fuck.

**EDIT:** HEY GUYS would it help if I checked the 'login birthday prompt' on my site preferences?  It gives a birthday prompt when someone is logging in from an unknown location. 




 There is none, it never actually got released.  So I can't dress it up in dress to impress lol 




 He was willing to wait for me to be ready for sex, but I ended the relationship because I did not want to give him that impression.  I knew I would never want to be intimate with him like that, so I broke it off to avoid pulling him along.  I say that like it was a simple thing, but it was terribly sad.  

Honestly, I'll not even consider dating another person unless they're asexual.  ):  It's just there aren't many asexual people out there, so the chances of me being alone are pretty high. 




 From what I have experienced, sexual attraction is different from romantic attraction.  Romantic attraction is the emotional response to a person.  I liked being around him and spending my time with him and being affectionate with him.  I did not know how to define sexual attraction at least, until someone described it as being hungry and having a plate of your favorite food sitting in front of you, and wanting to eat it.  Honestly, I've never wanted to ravage anybody, or have it done to me, gentle caress, or whatever.  Not even kissing.  It was always emotionally based for me.  I am capable of being romantically attracted to men, and I find them aesthetically pleasing-- but the romantic attraction is *always* at the forefront.  

I was not tipped off about the asexuality until I tried doing stuff with my second boyfriend and I felt disgusted with myself.  Even with my previous boyfriend before that, I felt a similar feeling, but just ended it before I could really think about it.  No matter how much I cared about him and trusted him, it was always disgust with myself when the matter came to sex.  Masturbation by myself is okay, and I have certain fantasies, but the thought of actually doing anything with any of them or of just normal sex sounds awful.  That probably makes so little sense haha.

I cannot fathom what it is like for a person to lose themselves in lust toward another willing person.  Kind of wish I did, it must be pretty exciting.  :P  But oh well
