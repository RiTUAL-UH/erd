 Am I the only one that notices Voat's logo is a Goat? 




 Do you even know anything about him? 









 Everyone here is going to talk about the seasons/weather, so I will just say get ready for traffic.  You said Lowell, which is a former mill town north west of Boston.  There's a University there and a couple community colleges holding the city together IMHO.  Not much of a nightlife unless you call banging down bud lights with your bros until 2 in the morning a nightlife.  Sure there are concerts and whatnot like any city.  I guess you just have to move here and check out the scene.  But be prepared for poverty, drug use (especially heroin), a lot of crime. 




 That's what they are looking into.  Obviously she lied to just about everybody, she got so used to lying, she thought it was true 




 Some 'merricun would shoot em 














 I've read it but thanks 




 Adam Kokesh lol 




 um no

 You should read "Lennon" the biography of John Lennon.  He couldn't read music either.  But he wrote some of the most important rock tunes of the history of music.  His first instrument was the 5 string banjo.  A lot of people don't know that.  His mom played one.  He always wanted a guitar, but both his mom and his Aunt forbade him from becoming a musician because of his loser dad (a professional cruise ship musician).   




 Really?  When I clicked on it, my antivirus software said it was a phishing page 









 At least take the time to vote him the fuck out of office!

The Rapture is coming soon. 




 for the record, so is this subreddit. 




 Voat rhymes with Stoat and tastes like Goat 




 He had a really interesting life story also.  I think I read that he was shipwrecked and the only one who could swim.  He made it to shore alive with his flute!! 




 I call it chutzpah 




 It's slow, but it works.  Every time.  

You've probably heard about one of our great musical historians, Chief O'Neil of Chicago.  Right?  He was an incredible dude.  Seriously.  He couldn't read music, but he remembered melodies by "rehearsing" them over and over in his head like you or I "rehearse" addresses or telephone numbers.  He would follow people around on street cars in the city, listen to the tunes they were singing or humming and go back to his office where a colleague who could write music wrote them down.

 hum the song, find the note using your finger on the fretboard and work from there.  that's how I do it, that's how most people do it.  a lot of composers use that method on the piano also 




 It'll be great for their meeting next year

 Just got off kakao with my sister-in-law.  She was at Samsung hospital for an ear operation.  She said the hospital is dead, like a morgue.  Nobody coming and going...like one of those end of the world zombie movies or something 




 How can you play mandolin if you don't know chords or the notes of a melody?  Serious question.

 My wife likes to read "romance novels" in Korean.  I usually ignore them, but one day she left one open and for kicks I ran it through Google translate.  All I can say is wow.  There was pretty much no romance involved. 









 aka Penelope Lopez, is not asian 














 I'll never forget my first interaction with a homosexual man in Korea.  He said that there are no gays in Korea.  I asked him what he was.  He said "I'm very friendly"

 Theater.  Oh well, they had to do something 


































 No idea.  Can't find anything in reverse image search 




 Is that the fat dude everybody hates? 




 I think Rogue is fine for a starter mando.  You can "upgrade" to an Eastman once you've saved a bit more 




 That was a fat hand 




 CP 




 Looks like a laundry rack 




 That's awesome 




 the former diggers who became redditors are fleeing to voat.  frankly, I'm glad to see them go.  Maybe once they are gone, reddit will return to its former glory. 




 Seriously voat is bad.  You can't vote on voat 




 PAO comes from the chinese name Bao

Last name origins   meanings:

Chinese: there are three different surnames that are Romanized in pinyin as Bao. Other Romanizations include Bau, Pao, and Pau.
Chinese:  this character also means abalone, but the name comes from an old place name. The area of Bao was granted to a chief counselor of the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (722481 bc). His son took the place name as his surname and was called Bao Shuya. Bao Shuya was famous for his lofty moral character and was skilled at delegating authority, eventually becoming the first Chief King of the Spring and Autumn period.

Chinese:  this Chinese character means to wrap or package. The name is derived from the name of Shen Baoxu. Shen Baoxu was a senior official who lived 2500 years ago in the state of Chu. When the state of Chu was attacked by the state of Wu, Shen Baoxu went to the State of Qin to beg for aid. There, he reportedly cried for seven days and nights until the duke of Qin was moved to help rescue the state of Chu.

Chinese:  this character means (violently) sudden. It comes from the name of Bao Xingong, a duke during the Yin dynasty (14011122 bc). 




 I don't like voat because you can't downvote until you have 100 comment karma 




 Hubski is down.  Must be getting slammed with requests. 




 I lived in China for six months (Shenyang's Korea Town) during the height of the SARS fear.  Same thing: everyone wore masks.

Actually they wear them now for the pollution 









 Well, I am an MD here in the states. 




 Does this constitute harassment?  If so, you're helping further the case for banning our subreddit 




 Second it 




 ha ha ok 




 My wife's family is in Seoul.  She talks with her sisters every day over KaKao.  She said there's a lot of worry.

 nope doesn't work in my area (Amherst, MA) 





























 wow you posted this 4 times.  I've reported you 




 That he lies, that he spreads disinformation which just clouds the waters.  He has an opportunity to tell the truth, to be something we can trust (which I need.  We need), but instead, he had decided to lie and that just made me disappointed for a couple of years, now I'm pissed off about it.  I even had a phone conversation with him once about his lies.   




 You won't get much more out of Fulford.   




 What is his real name?  IS it Gordon Duff or Robert Foote? 





























 It's happening on its own.  The Baby Boomers (my generation) are largely responsible for the old way of thinking.  Once we are gone (18,000 of us a year until 2020), these old paradigms will be relegated to traditional religious customs.  But Generation Z is largely non-religious (40% according to a recent Pew study), further rendering this influence negligible.  




 There's a city in China called Kunming, where all of the social/gender roles are reversed.   




 I believe it was inevitable that this happened.

First we needed online 24/7 with all the social anonymity it offers (nobody can see you're a girl or a boy when you comment or share)

Then we needed a couple generations to grow up with that permanent access

Young women of this generation (post 1995) have learned that what they say and do online is as good or as valid as anybody else.  It's probably the first generation that is completely empowered to be whatever they want to be without the judgement usually associated with sex/gender.

I think it's a good thing and I'm eager to watch and learn 









 And those aren't females...they are males.  LOL 




 no it's not at all like that.  Dungeons are 5 - 10 minute vignettes

by the way, if I were your mother, I'd wash your mouth out with soap.  Do you talk to your grandparents that way?   




 If you've forgotten already, WOW is a game, not a profession or a skill.  Many people find playing games relaxing.  You don't have to be good or bad.  You just play. 




 I have no idea how to join a raid. 









 I've been playing WOW since 2007.  I've never been on a raid so I don't know what it is 




 I have 18 level 100s on 3 servers.  None of them have epics, gems or enchants 




 A lot of people play WOW for fun or relaxation.  I'm one of them. 




 I'm not interested in that tomfoolery.   














 downvoted?  this one rocked on Facebook 




 How do you know a guy is Korean? 




 I hate it when someone makes a comment about my gear.   




 I disagree with you.  Dungeons is all I do these days. 




 WHO is telling us it's closer to 27%, but that's still too high 









 I love InfoLiars.com so much 









 Assuming your Collings has F holes, you can't hear it as well because of how the sound is projected from the holes.

A round hole instrument will always sound louder because of the way the sound projects.

 




 I've been playing mandolin since 1970.  I think toneguards are like copper bracelets were in the 1980s...a nice story, but without merit.

If your instrument is not sounding well, consider a set up from a real luthier.  A new (solid) bridge, a neck adjustment, different strings, fret work, a new tailpiece...all of these will have more of a demonstrable result than a piece of metal that clips onto your instrument.

FWIW a good set up is a requirement whether you play a cheap chinese instrument or a handmade luthier built one

 If it's related, then every other transaction that occurred prior to 9/11 and after 9/11 is also related 




 But not the JFK assassination 




 I was born in Boston in 1952 so yeah.  I've seen everything.  My wife and I owned a house in East Orleans during the 1980s and 90s.  




 yep.  and all the ones preceding it.  I wasn't born on 9/11 douchebag

 The reason superstition is not talked about in the main stream scientific community is that it is not tested in a lab setting.  For the most part.  And a lot of it can be tested.  But nobody is willing to.

Sam Harris talked about this for a time in a Joe Rogan conversation.  See if I can find the link.

Alt media is already discounted by the average American, especially 'tard sites like InfoLiars.com and Veterans30%IsLiesToday.com
