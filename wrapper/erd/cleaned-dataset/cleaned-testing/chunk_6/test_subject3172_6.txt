 5K shouldn't be a problem. It usually only starts being a concern around the two-hour mark. 




 Maybe you're running too fast during the running parts? It's way too easy to just charge out there, because dangit I'm *running* and that means going fast. (There are involuntary physiological aspects as well.) You should be able to easily carry on a conversation while you're running. The rule I learned is, if you can't talk you're too fast, if you can sing you're not fast enough. 




 The best way to transition to barefoot-style running (whether literally barefoot or in minimalist shoes) is to learn the new motion bit by bit, and the best way to do that is [Hundred-Ups.](http://hundredup.com/) I do a set of these before every workout, even if it's not running, and it's helped tremendously. It will help your form even if you don't go the minimalist-shoe route. 




 Not sure what to say except, go to a different shop. If your options are limited, look online (I think Runner's World is a good site) for "tips on choosing a running shoe" articles. Those are generally helpful.

You might see a debate over stability vs. minimalist shoes, but try not to get caught up in it just yet. Go with something similar to what you've been using before; you want to change gradually if at all. 




 We don't know whether his initial reaction was "I still care about you but I can't handle the sadness" or "Get the hell out of my sight forever"; I'm guessing, on the evidence, it was closer to the former. It grows out of what their relationship had been like and the circumstances of the cheating, too -- solid marriage, momentary weakness? It happens. And people just handle these things differently.  




 Regarding Mr. Eisinger's recommendation to cold-call reporters: That's a good idea, and [here's a good post](http://www.theawl.com/2012/05/how-to-get-and-keep-a-mentor) on how to go about it without sounding too needy. I believe most journalists would love to help you out, but the right approach will really smooth things along, so to speak. 




 I've always felt affinity for the idea that we should spend part of our time learning and part of it teaching. So, yes.

I also think the point of the advice isn't that you can't learn from people who seem like lesser lights, it's that if you notice yourself feeling superior, you need to go find some perspective. 




 "Religion is the socialization of spiritual experience." The history, rituals, and so forth are part and parcel of this socialization -- they form the mental and social environment in which one practices and expresses one's faith. It's sort of the connective tissue of the community. 




 Haven't been there much myself, but the Fine Arts library gets good reviews from my friends. Worth checking out. 




 And this actually constitutes progress. 




 You always find something in the last place you look. 




 As /u/chass3 said, north and northwest are your best bets, but everyone else knows it too, so empty spaces are scarce. Also, some neighborhoods have resident-only parking to discourage commuters, so check the signs carefully. Depending on how far away you're coming from, it may be less hassle to park farther away near a bus or shuttle stop and ride in the rest of the way. 




 It's your day, then! 




 Ah, I've been wondering where the good bits of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLmcGkvJ-e0 came from. 




 Thanks, you too! 




 Thanks, you too! 




 I'm in grad school (finishing this year) but I've been sending out apps for both teaching jobs and jobs in my previous field for ... a while now. I only really got serious about applying to *lots* of jobs recently. 




 I think the abyss they fall into is not infinite like a black hole, but you need to send out enough to fill it up so some of them are visible from the top. 




 I wish I knew. The Great Internet Ovipositor dropped it in front of me via one of those Tumblr gif things. 




 Hang in there. It seemed to take forever for me. 









 You're the expert. 




 Sort of on topic: Roy Blount Jr. once took a course on race car driving to write an article about it. He was easily taller than everyone else there. The instructor pointed out that most race drivers are not very tall and asked why that might be. Blount said, "Tall men don't need fast cars to impress women." The others weren't happy, but no one disagreed. 




 I love how even though the officer says the truck drove *through* the guard arms, most of the commenters say that "You can't drive around the double crossing guards, so obviously he had driven onto the tracks before they came down, and stopped there." 




 The [Disappointing Gay Best Friend](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD4801D9AE40896C3) series is hilarious.

 I have washtub abs. 




 [The Austin Lounge Lizards know it too.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBe5Dx6kSJg)

By God we're so darn proud to be from Texas - yahoo!

Even of our pride we're proud and we're proud of that pride, too 

Our pride about our home state is the proudest pride indeed

And we're proud to be Americans, until we can secede

Our accents are the drawliest

Our howdies are the y'alliest

Our lone star flag's the waviest

Our fried steak's the cream-graviest 

Our rattlesnakes the coiliest

Our beaches are the oiliest 

Our politicians most corrupt

Our stop signs most abrupt

Our guitars are the twangiest

Our guns are the ka-blangiest

Our cattle the long-horniest

Our yodels the forlorniest

Our cookoffs are the chiliest

Our Waylon is the Williest

Our sausage is the smokiest

Our neighbors are the Okiest 




 I studied all night for my blood test and got an A-. 




 This isn't a math problem, it's a critical-thinking problem. Question your assumptions.

So one of the four given values is wrong. But are we sure it's b? What if it's a, x, or y? 




 Your math is wrong. Between your second and third line you divided two of the three terms by 5. You should add 10 to both sides so there's only one term on each side, *then* divide by 5. 




 H.L. Mencken, 1909:

*Apologies for Love* -- by F.A. Myers. "'Do you remain long in Paris, Miss Wadsworth?' Earl Nero Pensive [!!!] inquired, as he seated himself beside her. His eyes, like beaming lights out of shadowless abysm, were transfixed upon her as if by magic force ..." Thus the story begins. God knows how it ends!

 I'll put in a plug for green jays, though they only inhabit a small part of the southern end of the state. 




 They are parrots; parakeets are members of the parrot family. The monk parakeets are also known as Quaker parrots. 




 Dead animal, actually. 




 Austin has two car-sharing services, Zipcar and Car2go, that have annual fees in the $30-40 range and then you pay per trip. In a pinch you can usually use one of them; it seems pricey at the time, every other day of the year you're not maintaining your own car, so unless you *have* to drive to the suburbs twice a week you come out ahead.

Another option is to get a scooter or motorcycle; you can park them lots of places on campus with a parking pass that's under $100. I love parking half a block from the library.

 I grew up in Kansas, and we called our region the Midwest, too, but really the only thing the Great Plains shares culturally with the Great Lakes is that we're not the coasts. 

Many of the central Plains states are some combo of prairie (North Texas) and High Plains (Panhandle, West Texas). A more granular map would treat them separately, but it's not crazy to lump them together that way.  




 Cattle are herbivores, but factory feedlots will feed them just about anything, including animal protein supplements. So you could have cattle that have eaten (parts of) other cattle.

 Damian Lewis is held prisoner for years, gains his freedom, and goes to work for the government.

 Ditto to this, there's a lot of free weight racks now at Gregory. Also the rec center at the south end of campus has some racks, and it's seldom busy; that's a good place to avoid the Gregory crowds.  




 "The horror ... the horror" 




 BTW I found that in a quick search on the terms "reuters gun deaths graphic" (without the quotes) and following one of the first links, to a design blog discussing the controversy that had the sought-after links. Searching on a few key words often turns up what you need fairly quickly, though it can be a bit of an art in addition to science. 




 [Here's](http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/02/US-FLORIDA0214.gif) the graphic at thomsonreuters.com (to show that they did publish it).

The designer is [Christine Chan](https://twitter.com/ChristineHHChan). She says [here](https://twitter.com/ChristineHHChan/status/455971685783441408) that her inspiration was a graphic that depicted Iraq war deaths as dripping blood, and tried for a similar effect. She acknowledges on her feed that it was confusing. 




 Less right-of-way and existing infrastructure to deal with between here and the moon. 




 I'm guessing it was physics.
