 Thanks for providing the article on peer review, I hadn't seen that one before and it was a good read. I still don't seen a better alternative to the peer-review system, though I think it can be improved. I made a comment about some of my own experiences with peer review and thoughts on an alternative system being trialed here: http://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/30xhcf/payforreview_good_idea_or_bad/

In terms of the article being peer-reviewed, if it's in a peer-reviewed journal it means that each article goes through the peer-review process to be accepted in the journal, so the article in this case was peer-reviewed. The process for that journal, an elsevier one, can be found here: http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/reviewer-guidelines. 




 1. Scrutinizing studies and taking them at face value is a good thing. The linked media article title "Study Finds Evidence That the MIND Diet May Protect Patients From Developing Alzheimers Disease" and the journal article title "MIND diet associated with reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease". At no point do they say MIND diet score more predictive - where are you getting that from? You say that "articles appear with title discrepancies..." I guess you mean articles in magazines and newspapers. Unfortunately, sensationalization occurs in the media and in some peer-reviewed journals but I don't see much here, the articles say that it MAY help which is all that can be taken from the studies at the moment.

2. Recent reports of wide-scale falsification in reports - that has happened recently (it has happened before and will again, the system is not flawless and scientists are humans that will be tempted by greed and money. The system is somewhat self-correcting, if nobody can repeat your cure or whatever then your study will be the exception and not the rule) with 43 papers to date that may increase. The 43 papers appeared to be from a Chinese ring and there's no suggestion that this paper would be part of that (US based and different publisher (i.e. NOT Biomed Central) to the ones linked to the falsification reports).

3. Echo chamber/positive feedback loop - I see what you mean but this paper builds on previous finding from 2 different labs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20305128 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23670794?dopt=Abstract) and no shared authors between the 3 papers. Repeatable findings (associations/correlations in this case) are part of a step forward and collectively strengthen the associations and increase evidence that it is an avenue to pursue.

4. You trust findings from a wider audience and peer reviewed journals rarely are. (Linking the source would be a major help as I don't quite get the point - I can only assume that you mean that the reviewers are too narrow focused on a certain area. I'd say having an expert in the field to review a paper a good thing, I wouldn't get an electrician and librarian to evaluate my heart health, I'd go to a cardiologist or a group of them who may be less "wide" but would have more relevant knowledge) So what other findings/sources do you use then? Does that mean you have sources you prefer to peer-reviewed articles? Personally, I'd base any health choices from peer-reviewed articles or use such articles to see if any claims have any truth to them. The peer-review system isn't perfect but I don't know of a better system (it can be improved with the publication of more studies showing no effects amongst other things). 

5. I interpret this paper as saying that this diet may help decrease or delay the onset of Alzheimers. More detailed questionnaires (geographical location, occupation, socio-economic status, exercise levels etc.) would be needed to eliminate potential confounding factors (e.g. those on the MIND diet may exercise more and once you account for that the diet doesn't have a significant effect). The mechanisitic basis would need to be determined as well (i.e. what part of the diet is beneficial, on the molecular level how does it work etc.). All that takes time, in the meantime I think the **authors** have done a decent job without hyperbole (*media coverage* may be different and they thrive on hyperbole which is unethical and disheartening). The Mediterranean diet has been shown to be **correlated** with increased healthspan (better cardiovascular function I know of perhaps more) so based on current information it seems like it's a good diet to prolong healthspan. Does it mean that it definitely will?, no - it might do nothing. I think the current information should be released to the public to let them decide if they want to follow it or guide their diet choices.

EDIT - balanced out point 2 a bit more. 




 Can you provide the source/article where it says that the journal is peer reviewed and not the paper? That makes no sense to me, if it's a peer-reviewed journal it means that the papers in the journal are peer-reviewed. I can't see anything to suggest that paper would not be peer-reviewed (happy to be shown wrong, just would be extremely surprising).

 




 Both have elements of truth to what they are saying. Protein synthesis is maximal in the first 3hrs after resistance exercise, is elevated for at least 24hrs post workout and ingesting protein in this time increase protein synthesis further. To say that not ingesting after 30mins means it will all go to waste is not true, you won't get as much of an increase in protein synthesis but you will get some.

Matching daily protein intake will mean that you won't lose muscle mass which occurs if you workout and exclude all protein. However, timing to get maximal synthesis is important.

Travelling right now but this will cover what you were asking:

 So both whey and meats contain all the essential amino acids. There are a couple of reasons why whey is better than meat:

1. It is digested faster (no need to break down connective tissue, cell walls etc. to liberate the protein). Exercise accelerates/amplifies protein synthesis but within a time window, so fast absorption is needed.

2. Whey contains a higher proportion of branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Protein synthesis is largely controlled by a protein called mTOR which is activated by exercise and this activation is increased and prolonged potently by leucine. All the other essential amino acids are required for this not just leucine but leucine acts as the signal for the boost in protein synthesis.

These are a couple of reviews on the topic by 2 leaders in the field if you're interested (free access):

http://www.gssiweb.org/en/Article/sse-107-protein-consumption-and-resistance-exercise-maximizing-anabolic-potential 




 I was talking about protein synthesis, which is a key determinant for adaptation to exercise, and if you look at figure 5 is significantly higher with whey protein following exercise than soy or casein.

Why does the similar insulin spike invalidate that? 




 OK, a lot of people didn't like me saying exercise and eat as well as you can. The exercise and eat well was a general piece of advice not just about recovery for the general public. 

Looking at recovery for a one-off diet doesn't mean that it will translate to a long-term benefit. 

In this study a high fat diet led to a reduce improvement in exercise following an 8 wk training program compared to a high carb diet. Both improved performance but the carb diet was better than a high fat diet: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1158881/

Does that mean a high-fat diet is always bad? Perhaps not if you're an elite athlete, here endurance trained athletes did not have the same negative effects on energy efficiency as sedentary people in response to a high-fat diet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632846 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106937

Does that mean fat is bad and shouldn't be used, again no. In this study low fat decreases performance http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10682876

In terms of the protein the source of protein is important to maximize protein synthesis, with whey protein being the best due to its high branched chain amino acid (particularly leucine) content and how rapidly it can be digested and taken up into the bloodstream: 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961

Does that mean that whey protein work well with the whole population? No, elderly people have lower response to it but including vitamin D3 and additional lecuine can help maintain muscle mass in elderly obese patients on a weight loss program. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646324

Exercise acts as a potent inducer of protein synthesis when eating a meal (i.e. eating will increase protein synthesis, exercise and get a bigger increase which can lead to increases in muscle mass): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23438221

That's a few links there. Are there some contradictory papers, yes there will be and there will be other supporting the claims. The papers I've picked are ones where they have been performed well and are not acute but occur over a period of time. A lot of papers citing high fat diet benefits are from rats (different metabolism, more distinct fiber-types and they are allowed to give more extreme diets) which may not translate to humans.

People like a yes or no, good or bad answer for everything. People respond differently due to genetics, age, disease etc. This means that different diets can have vastly different effects on people. Taking into account the general population eating a balanced diet and exercise will help keep you healthier was the point that I was making. In my opinion people get too caught up in "Oh you need this extreme diet or pill to see a benefit of exercise". Can they help, in some cases but not all. If it works for you great but people thinking they need some diet can put them off exercise when it shouldn't really. If you want to eat fast food go ahead and if you exercise it's better for you. If you want to take anything from this then just exercise!

EDIT: made a mistake in the penultimate sentence and gave a clearer message
 




 This isn't all that surprising, as it's a short-term study (1 pre and post-recovery workout for each diet) focusing on exercise recovery and glycogen recovery. Any high-glycemic carbohydrates will restore glycogen levels quickly following exercise so what form you take them in isn't that important - when you just look at glycogen levels and short-term recovery. 

Long-term may be a different story though - the fast food diet may not enable you to maximize adaptations to exercise. Having said that you will still get the some (likely a lot) of the benefits of exercise. 

The easy, simple advice is to just exercise and eat as well as you can.

EDIT: I've put a longer reply to the people asking for sources on things. The healthy diet and exercise was a general diet comment but the key is to exercise. People who exercise have less of the bad effects of a 1wk high-fat meal http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632846 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106937

In terms of "as macronutrient content is the same then there shouldn't be a difference". Not necessarily, not all protein is equal with whey protein having the maximal increase on protein synthesis both at rest and following exercise http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961. So 25g whey protein should cause a bigger increase in protein synthesis than 25g protein from a burger. There may be differences in fat type (i.e. saturated vs unsaturated) too.

So new summary, just exercise and if you want take diet into account


 




 Hmm it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. A couple of points about how this might affect the process:

1. The journal aims for a decision within 30 days already. I've submitted to journals with this aim and had to wait up to 10 weeks for the initial decision. Having a guaranteed decision time is great for the submitting authors (assuming it is peer-reviewed correctly etc.)

2. This process will use reviewers employed an external company. Typical peer review is sent to somebody (ideally 3 reviewers) in the field of study who review it free of charge - it's something that at least in academia you are expected to do. The downside of this is that reviewer may be time pressed due to work commitments which results in either a delayed response time or a poor review. I've had a review where only comments on the abstract were made and took 10 weeks to get, the paper was accepted but I wouldn't class that as a peer review (there was one other reviewer who did a marginally better job). It's interesting that scientifc reports says they only guarantee one reviewer for the traditional route, which I think is complete bullshit. There should be 3 reviewers to enable the editor to make an informed decision and get a more representative view. Hopefully they do send it out to 3 reviewers and it's more of a legal thing by guaranteeing one reviewer as sometimes a reviewer can accept a paper but not return it in time.

3. The main concern would be what quality of reviewers this company has. Are they up to date in the field of the study? Is the field their specialty or just given to them as they have some form of biology background and is closely associated with their background?

4. The quality and format of review is a real concern too. *"The review process itself is also streamlined, using an online scorecard instead of the traditional approach of comments, questions, and suggestions".* Does this mean reviewers can't make comments with this system? If so, then how can a study to be improved? A key facet of peer-review is other scientists guiding you on how to improve it. Say I submit a paper and get a 4/10, how does that help me? I need to improve it, OK but how?

5. So do you just get accepted or rejected with his scorecard system? It must be unbelievably rare for a study to be accepted without changes being made. If you are able to re-submit does it go the same reviewers or get banded about to different to reviewers? Again if they can't comment and they want something addressed am I just waiting for blind luck to address their concerns. If you can re-submit is that covered with the fee or do I pay again?

6. The benefits of the reviewers from this company is that they may have the time and pressure to submit a good detailed review (I.e. If there are complaints about the review they may receive less work). If they have more time they may read up on the specifics of the paper which will let them perform a more detailed, nuanced review - again if they just use a scorecard then this benefit is lost. As an academic, if I was to give a rubbish review, as I volunteered to do it, it's likely nothing would be said to me. Perhaps the editor may put an asterisk to my name to not send me a review again (which is what a good editor would do) but I doubt many do this (I know of one who does, other editors seems to have its a luck of the draw thing based on my letter to the editor following the peer review of my abstract).

7. The people reviewing the document shouldn't really care if it's accepted as they get paid regardless, same with the company. Scientific reports will in the vast majority of cases go with the reviewers decision so they shouldn't care if you've paid or not. The journal does need to say how much money they take themselves from this extra fee.

8. It costs $1495 to publish in this journal and an extra $750 for this sped up process, so potentially $2245 in total. I appreciate open access papers and anybody getting to view them. However, I do find the costs with this (not just this journal) concerning. The money could be used on research rather than publishing costs or providing funding to more labs. It'd be interesting to see how much money is given by granting agencies for publication fees.

9. This will put a greater divide between labs with more funding and those that don't. It may help widen the gap as these journals have more press coverage which in turn may help you get more funding.

In short, if the company has good quality reviewers then this may be a good thing if you exclude the cost bias between labs. Scientific reports should make the review process for every paper open to the public and have complete transparency. It'll be interesting to see what the review scorecards are like. As a scientist I would rather they said pay x-amount for a good detailed review not a fast review but perhaps I'm a bit naive...
