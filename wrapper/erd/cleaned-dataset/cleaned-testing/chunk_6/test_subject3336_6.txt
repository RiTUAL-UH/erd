 Thank you for this :D 




 ah yea, but manageable  




 It's got the curves and it looks so good  




 i hope my aero knowledge helps me here...  
That paint will give give a better picture of real world conditions.  
Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.  
when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.  

For eg. on the front winglet side below CNN [3rd pic](http://imgur.com/a/CwxBt) you can clearly see the 3 vortex shapes  
2nd pic - a good part of airflow is going into the side vents

 i personally don't have a MacBook, friends do and they swear by Safari's being the kindest on the battery. Chrome does reduce it by hours.  
I've been avoiding Flash on Linux for a long-time now, don't remember it being a severe drain for me...probably coz i stay off video sites 




 Chrome is massive battery drain http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/10/8381447/chrome-macbook-battery-life 




 :D good! 




  latex

not sure, Give it another try ;) 




 i get constant broken playback with the spinner on 0:00 - 0:25 seconds. After that somehow it mans up and plays :| 




 Brilliant :D 




 same reason :D 




 i agree with this, playback is way smoother on chrome than Firefox by a good margin on Linux and considerably closer with Windows 7 




 yeah a wait till 2019 




 do check out Infinality and freetype-freeworld ;) 




 you should definitely check out Infinality and freetype-freeworld then ;) 




 Dont know if this will help you, but try switching to OpenDNS or Google DNS.  
Also noticed WiFi performance drops when an external Hard Drive is connected due to interference.   
Try [Reset Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) or [Create a New Profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)(Data Loss if not backed up) 




 i think MS is quite happy with its ClearType Tech. Its sucks on the desktop for me but i do like it on WP. Very Crisp and sharp.  

The Font scene is patent ridden. We would have had better than Apple level font rendering on Linux and elsewhere but sadly some patents still [remain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) and hinder progress.  

But as always workarounds are possible on Linux with:  
[Infinality](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html) and [Freetype-freeworld](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/)

EDIT - ClearType + DirectWrite from Win 7 onwards 




 All of us love good fonts and the way its rendered on our Android devices, but I think its more important to be thankful to the project and its creators/contributors who work behind the scenes.  
Meet Freetype - http://www.freetype.org/  :D

Ps.   
If you'd like to contribute to their funding campaign - https://pledgie.com/campaigns/24434 




 i hope this helps, and gimp gets its charm back!  
More importantly if some team solely works on GIMP it'll be a big win :D   




 the team that takes it up has to deliver, or the trust is lost 




 Thanks a lot for the info :D  
i was surprised when the i noticed the difference between Beta   Nightly.(Logged into Windows 7 after several months).  
My laptop uses Hybrid Graphics(Optimus) - Nvidia GT525M and Intel HD3000  
My laptop's graphics drivers are updated as per Dell's site.  
The Intel website asks me to use the manufacturers driver(older compared to Intel) when i went there looking for updated version, saying that some drivers maybe custom built for specific hardware. I didn't mess around with the drivers after reading that :|

EDIT - yes turning off HWA fixed the issue for me in nightly   




 Why do i get a black audio-only YouTube video on Nightly vs normal playback on Firefox Beta?   
Windows 7 64bit (including Browsers)  
I've tried out turning off Hardware Acceleration as the current work around for the issue on Nightly. Any Idea why this happens? 




 i wish somebody does this for GIMP. It could use some love! 




 Darth Vader's ride 




  Is there no other environmental agency other than greenpeace?

Yes there are! And it would be better if we have them than not.  
Personally haven't seen anyone else take the fight ,on different issues, to the corporate giants and the Govt itself.  

 The only deep pockets I saw were of greenpeace. Chipko andolan worked without foreign support. Dont try to show greenpeace as warriors.

Yes i agree, income should be audited and things like this should be transparent; but same should be made mandatory for Political parties, Govt. Income   Expenditure along with finance listing for top organizations in the country.   
This is where its one-sided.   

 They are just a front for vested interest

Legally(Court) they haven't been accused for any mistake so far.  

 The ones which would like to keep any country energy dependent. If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

I disagree. Every country is energy dependent be it US, Japan etc. They import resources to make Energy(Oil, Uranium, Coal).   

Yes i do agree to the fact that protest against the Nuclear Plant in the south was harsh, i personally support nuclear power, but you can't avoid a Disaster like Fukushima can You?   
Radioactive contamination has reached the shores of Canada today.  
Chernobyll is still a ghost town, the negative of Nuclear Power is still very dangerous.  
The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is in a region of Seismic activity, and i hope it works in perfect condition to benefit us all.  

If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

LOL. Solar power is greener and I don't think anyone will oppose it. But yes it has negative effects too  
solar heats the region in which the plant is situated to extremely hot temperatures. Its [frying birds](http://news.discovery.com/tech/alternative-power-sources/worlds-largest-solar-power-plant-scorching-birds-140219.htm) these days. Best way is to locate it in non migratory paths of flying creatures.  









 Exactly, i can see why you got the down-votes.  
Transparency should be at every level from party incomes to MNC giants as well.  
I agree Greenpeace has sometimes been aggressive with Environmental Issues, but its not like they killed some big project for the worse.   
This seems a one-sided battle to crush your opposition because you can't be better.  
Deep pockets try an score a win every where.  
And honestly we need a Greenpeace or something of its kind. None of us citizens are so morally bothered to protect our environment or the way its misused by corporate giants in the name of "development"   









 why dont you save the VM after doing the initial setup? 




 you'll need this https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin 




  Donations should always come from people who can afford the one dollar and that dollar won't impact their lives in any way.

Yes! I do wish people who could afford pay for it though.  
  
Also i believe if a game is launched and it has great reviews, people wont be put-off for doing a one-time payment/donation.  
I recently bought Limbo because they slashed prices.  
What becomes irritating is in-app purchases to unlock some special feature, it does help you but it has a bad impact on the mindset of a user and keeps them from coming back.
 




 The problem with donation is the currency conversion.  
Dollars might be good for the west and the people living there, but for us on the East say,   
India  1$=63.58 Rs  
Japan 1$=119.78 yen  
Philippines 1$=44.58 peso  

It is quite a considerable amount. In india you'd get 12-13 packs of 5Rs biscuits or 4 Packets of bread(15 Rs.)   
Most of the people here in possession of a smart phone are teens and early adults who depend on their parents to provide them with funds, so they tend to avoid buy/donating apps which cost.   
Probably once they start earning this trend could change  

I do buy games and donate if im in financial capacity though :)   




 check your add-ons. Follow the trouble shooting instruction on the right side of this page.  

If nothing fixes its probably because of low RAM. Yes throwing away the external antivirus/firewall softwares could help in getting more free ram for the browser.  
Another thing you could do it browse with some tab limit - like 4-6 tabs   









 This post Represent! 
Thank You _/\_ for working on this 




 it look STUNNING O_O :D
I wish every TV gets this or a way to load this OS  




 loading fine for me  




 Please do try using safe mode and browsing for a while and see if that makes a difference.  If its fine then one of your add-ons is the likely problem source.  

You could [Refresh](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) your browser. Warning you'll have to reinstall your add-ons.  

Create a SEPARATE new profile and see if that works out for you OR back up data and move it to a new profile.  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles   




 Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.   

We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.  

Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.  

Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.  
It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.  

EDIT  
Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.  
Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).  
This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.   




 VP9 is still being worked on, so once that comes playback will be super good 




 i think bugs are being filed for this, do have a look at bugzilla. 




 On android they are splitting up Facebook and the messages app as Messenger. Users are required to download both if they want access to Facebook and if they want to message their friends. 


Browser side I don't think we'll see a difference whether you use Firefox on android or desktop to browse facebook.com  




 O_O probably clear cache from Recovery.  
Runs smooth on my phone. Use it everyday 




 it runs fine on my moto g 1 Gig.  
It was a different story on my 512MB Ram Mediatek Micromax Canvas. Horrible.  
But yeah i do agree on the hog part  




 Mediatek ones, snapdragon processors run fine. 




 Also - Please spread Web Literacy. It is crucial for the future. Take part in event that promote Web Literacy.  
Being misinformed is as dangerous as being unaware or ignorant.   









 i think i have taken it for granted for a long time now  









 Enable webM in about config, in case it hasn't been enabled. I think it's still a WIP - vp9 support  




 I hope you are talking about desktop Firefox.  
visit www.youtube.com/html5 check that every box is enabled and html5 player is active.  
Change quality by clicking the gear icon on the player.  
Right click video - stats for nerds to see if its mp4/vp9   




 flair it solved
 




 go to your firefox folder in terminal and execute the firefox file located there "./filename"  
If there's any error you should see there.  
Im on Fedora/ubuntu and using Firefox so not a linux or firefox problem. Something related to your set-up.  
Also ensure you're not behind any proxy or check the proxy settings in the browser/system  
For Firefox - PreferencesAdvancedNetworkConnection Settings 




 Also additional info - vp9 kinda works fine on chrome and firefox. Its just without MSE its kinda horrible  




 oh thanks a lot! :) hope it gets resolved soon! 




 H264 - Buffering is not smooth and choppy, so playback stops until video is loaded further

If only somebody could #SaveEBR  




 That is an awesome link!  




 Yeah filed for bankruptcy. They could use some awareness and help. 
It's heartbreaking to see him fail over and over again  
I wish the Internet could #SaveEBR.  
He really deserves help.

 Please DO! Amazing films especially Road; they are Documentaries but worth watching!   
Road - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjrwABtIIvQ  
TT3D - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QldZiR9eQ_0  

I hope EBR gets saved somehow.

Its sad to see dreams get crushed over and over again :'( 




 Yeah! i really liked Road (2014) and TT3D: Closer to the Edge (2011)! 

Its good more bike movies are coming! :D 




 Is it just me or does Erik Buell sound like Heisenberg. O_O 




 Check out the trailer here - https://vimeo.com/ondemand/theraggededge  
Is it just me or does Erik Buell sound like Heisenberg. :O 









 Dont want to switch it off, i hope it helps in telemetry.  
I believe it might be reported since its be ongoing for sometime, trying to bug hunt it down. 




 Flair it 'Solved'! :) 




 Im getting this quite a lot on Nightly version 40.0a1 (2015-04-29) on Fedora Linux 20 with e10s enabled  
"a web page is causing Nightly to run slowly. What would you like to do"  
This happens randomly after some continous time of browsing, and every tab I have opened goes white with that spinner loading icon - spinning.  
Clicking the 'x' stop button on awesome/address bar does not stop the page loading.  
Refreshing other tabs also has no effect.  
Firefox keeps showing the loading spinner in content display area.  
Killing the Web process, works but this problem comes back rather quickly  
Any solution? I've only been using facebook, reddit, bugzilla, Imgur, whatsapp web.  
Also many a time, switching inbetween tabs causes the white page and loading spinner to re-appear(This happens often).  
Tried the normal trouble-shoots i.e. new profile, refresh browser etc.   




 awesome :) 




 check what boxes are checked on youtube.com/html5. 
if everything is checked you should get it without troubles.  

Also it came first to chrome because it is a Google product, just like YouTube. They went in with full preparation to implement and launch before others hoped onto the train. 




 yeah thats there, i survive on a 1k unliimited plan 




 That is expensive! 3k of your salary on internet connectivity is horrendous 




 Yes it becomes more lossy. They compress it to save on size. Happens on Facebook all the time for any pic above a 100kb 




 Bsnl had given me the best speed on 3g. It surprised me. Docomo was great for 2g  




 i finally got it! :D 




  Boys hate pants

 You need to install a codec pack.    
You'll probably have to download Windows Media Player if its not already installed. 




 Prey, Next and Micro - Michael Crichton! :D 




 aw thats bad :/  
Ps. - Join the LinuxMasterRace! ;) 




 https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/984694 




 why don't you try creating a separate new profile and see if the issue persists, without installing any additonal add-ons etc, and browsing as you do.  

If things are fine now, the mostly some add-on you have is to blame or you could backup your Firefox data, create a new profile and restore the data  




 shumway is flash for firefox. Im not sure if its going to help your YouTube viewing.   
what you should be doing is possibly get a codec pack installed on your system for "h.264".  
The options to enable MSE on the second line lies in about:config. under "mediasource" 




 It's the sound of hope!  




 Do u have an external hard drive connected when this happens?  




 we are here for a deppception 




  The only other thing I've seen her in is in 21 Jump Street and The Five-Year Engagement

Wasn't she Amy in The social network?

 




 i liked the Ang Lee's hulk over every other hulk(neglect CG improvements) so far. It was beautifully shot and told.

 Im not familiar with AMD hybrids, but on Bumblebee(Nvidia) you get to use the GPU with and "optirun" command to force such an action. There could be something like that for AMD.

 http://wp.me/p1eITv-20 made this a while back, has all the usage basics to give a head start right away  




 what all enabled for you on youtube.com/html5 ? 




 I think it's because of adaptive streaming rates, you can go low as 144p. Trying setting YouTube player to 360p for some decent quality  




 oh, thanks for pointing that out! 




  Don't Track Me Google, ah just enable it in the settiings/Preferences - Privacy (Do Not Track) - no need for extensions.  
DownThemAll - all the way :D and Video DownloadHelper for YouTube etc.
