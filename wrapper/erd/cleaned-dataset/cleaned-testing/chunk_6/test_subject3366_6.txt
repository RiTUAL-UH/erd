 No, I appreciate the dialogue. Not sure where your 7million+ figure comes from. We don't do meta posts for the same reason we don't do  brony posts - it's not technology-related and we are a technology sub. There are plenty of forums for it, but like it or loathe it, we do need to make calls on submissions. We aim to do so openly and transparently, as reddit expects. You're free to complain, or to call us out if you think we're getting it wrong, can chat with us anytime. If you have suggestions, we'll happily hear them, and consider. This is how we came up with our rules, through subscriber consensus. Laws of the sub for the sub by the sub. Anything we change will also require consultation and approval by the sub. Was an exhaustive process to rehabilitate after the dramas (which are actually far more fascinating than people realise,,that shit is almost movie material with MK Shyamalan-Bambalam), but as a tech purist with no agenda nor desire for anything more than a quality tech sub for the tech community. And I (we) approve of all our mods, and don't hesitate to call each other out if we appear to stray from our mission to serve and deliver. Peace out. 




 Yeah, we have the same arguments. What do you do when it's about a tech company but really more business-related, but has ended up popular? Damned if we do, damned if we don't delete. We are looking at the rules to see if we can hone them (subject to sub approval obviously). I'm not 'murikano, so I really don't give a fuck about Comcast, but upvotes say pplz do. Now, is it tech relevant? Y'see, mod dilemma..what do current technology subscribers enjoy vs what should technology sub be That is our problem, and if you have an easy solution, share it. we're damned either way, on the left we drown in fluff and Comcast. on the right do we go hardcore tech on the left. As a general sub, we have to remain a broad techology spectrum. We do have filters, we do have flairs you can filter by. We will never please all the people all the time, it's impossible. Feel free to complain, but undersand we're everything tech-related and delivering as streamlined a service as we can for free. if you have any constructive suggestions as to how we could make it better, we'd welcome that and discuss it. All mods (aside from 2 originals who don't do much) are post shitstorm..was drafted in to fix things. We are not evil, don't paint us with a broad outdated brush. Can say, current mod team is decent. And /u/creq will be creq, you want a creq in your life, keeps shit real..  




 New mods, valid reversals. Our rules were selected by the pplz, voted on and adopted. Some are somewhat vague, which is helpful because it's hard to nail down in one law what can apply to every situation. Should broadly make sense when people read it. But we don't want to preclude valid posts in the technology sphere. Thankfully our readers are extremely helpful in flagging the bad, and frankly I'm proud of the effort of our mod team, coming here each day, cleaning up judiciously, approving, flairing (so you can filter), for nothing more than we like tech. You can yell at us, but I'd prefer you don't. If you have a specific issue, please do. 




 Maybe you missed the extensive consultation process. And no it wasn't. The reason behind no meta is that this is a technology sub, and there are plenty of subs that grievances, real or imagined, can be aired in. It's not something that belongs in a sub about technology. Not in any way hiding from it, you could also ask us directly, we need feedback, and if valid, after discussion, we may change. We are your friends, not some elite with agendas. We are students, professionals, loners, scriptkiddies, unemployed,wise, annoying..and in my case devilishly attractive on top of all of that. Cut us some slack, or just talk to us. 




 Well I haven't seen the specific history, so can't comment on that. I will vouch for creq as a decent human being. And appreciate that he was the canary in the coalmine that exposed the [mod corruption](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-censorship-technology-drama-default/) that nearly killed /r/technology, and I guarantee he's fair and balanced (noit in a Fox way, but like what the words mean), but feel free to message me directly anytime with issues if that would be preferable. We do welcome feedback, ultimately we are trying to just deliver a quality tech stream. For little thanks, but I take the masses that aren't complaining as a good sign. Again, feel free to yell at me/us whenever you see us mess up, helps us improve. 




 So have I..and he really hasn't in excess, and always to keep to rules. We have new mods learning the ropes, mot something you need to get mad about.We're just tech fans trying to deliver tech stuff to you. Getting mad at us..is unwarranted. Talk to us anytime. We understand as well that no matter what we do, someone is going to be pissed off. But generally am happy with us today. Constructive criticism always welcome obv. 




 Oh..may have misinterpreted..just message the mods, button on the leftbar..we will respond, toute de suite depending on timezone, but modcrew are pretty global now. 
 




 That's because subclause of Rule 1 (as chosen, voted upon by all y'all) is no meta posts.  




 Lol! We have quite the congenial and collaborative mod team these days. Tekkies by profession, infoaddicts by nature..the mod hiring process is exhaustive. New crew just drafted in! You can check all that out too if you like. It's a rather time-consuming and thankless role, but ehh, we care.. 




 Jebus cripes..was unintentional mishap in tweaking, we will always remain open. Feel free to yell at us anytime if we deserve it, fair call. Or, y'know, tell us if something ain't right, we'll look at it, sort it, and appreciate the feedback. [Sorry 2 offend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43V6wA4Y75Q)

 I wouldn't do this. It assumes the two files are always going to be in the same location, or you'll get broken links errors whenever you open the second workbook, as would anyone you send it to. Also each time you change it, you lose the previous data, so no historic records. Why not have a second tab with all your Cell b4 '='Original Sheet'!B4' etc, then when you update it, right-click second tab, move a copy to new book, copy and paste special values to remove links, save it as whatever, then you have a permanent record. You could macro it, but it's 12 mouseclicks.

 Henneth Annn was a secret refuge for the Rangers of Ithilien created by the Steward Turin II circa TA 2900 in response to incursions of Orcs from Mordor. Other outposts were also established but Henneth Annn was the longest guarded and manned. It was forbidden in order to to keep it secret. Not a location innocents generally ventured through. 




 lolz! sounds liek a challenge.. does nothing 




 Aaand I grabbed one.. 




 From [his website:](http://banksy.co.uk/faq.asp)

*What do you think about people selling the art you put on the street?*

"As a kid I always dreamt of growing up to be a character in Robin Hood.

I just never realised I'd end up playing one of the gold coins."

He could be ridiculously rich if he chose to be. He doesn't appear to care. And he's never spoken out against his art being shared or monetized, merely ridiculed it. He's like the street art Tom Bombadil.

EDIT: [Lolzquote!](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/24/banksy-works-auction-london-hotel)

"Banksy would like to make it clear  this show has nothing to do with me and I think it's disgusting people are allowed to go displaying art on walls without getting permission." 




 Hmm..I can't find anything official from HarperCollins about it. Only on Amazon, Book Depository etc, or articles referring to it being on Amazon. Looks fishy. 




 That should read 2015, not 2016! It's been pushed back until the movies run their course.

 No, whilst we've been lenient with the interminable Comcast posts to the point we added a filter for the plethora of complainants about the Comcast posts, when it is tech related, this just isn't. Also no general customer complaint posts. This is a technology sub, you'll understand we want it to stay tech relevant.

 Sizewise yes, newswise no. It used to be a broad distinction between broadsheet and tabloid sizings as to content, but today less so as with falling readership many broadsheets have reduced to tabloid size. So tabloid size, broadsheet content to use semi-anachronisms.
