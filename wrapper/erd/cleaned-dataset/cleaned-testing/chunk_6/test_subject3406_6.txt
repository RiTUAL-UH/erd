 Yeah, no, not exactly.... Nudity done in protest is sometimes deemed to be protected speech, but it's not always. (Otherwise, every strip club in the country would have full nude dancing "in protest".)

It's a tough case to make, not easy. 




 Um, no. Your claim that an indecent exposure charge is "easily beaten under a First Amendment defense" is simply not true. Nudity can be protected speech, but it's rare and simply being naked in public isn't enough to be protected. To quote Justice Souter's concurring opinion in 1991's Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, "Nudity itself is not inherently expressive conduct." 




 Excellent-thanks, /u/rawnoodles10 , /u/TerraOperative , and /u/bobroberts7441 . I'm glad my instincts that it's the power steering causing the vapor weren't far off. 




 Hi Reddit. I have a '98 Corolla with about 117,000 miles on it or so. Last month, I saw some white vapor coming out of my hood, took it to the local mechanic, and they found nothing wrong. Then it started making a bad sounding noise under the hood, and I mentally prepared to start looking for cheap used cars. Fortunately, I took it to my trusted mechanic (not as local since I moved, but still localish), and they said I was low on power steering fluid. Put some in, noise went away, great!

Except today, I saw white vapor (with a not-so-great smell) under the hood again. I noticed it after I had to move the wheel back and forth to get out of a terribly-designed parking lot, which makes me thing that maybe the vapor is the power-steering overheating when I move the wheel? Would that make sense, and if so, what are the possible causes? (And if that doesn't make sense, well, er, what are the possible causes?)

Many thanks in advance for whatever advice you have (besides time to start saving up for a used car *rueful look*)! 




 Yep-I gave it three chances. They didn't show. I use Uber now. 




 Oh, definitely not. DSHEA was a huge win for the dietary supplement industry. 




 Agreed, although I'm unsure that drugs need to be redefined. Instead, I'd do away with the dietary supplement category, redistributing supplements to the food or drug categories. Things like ginkgo should be regulated as drugs. 




 It's not a technicality-your complaint is that these items should have information that inform consumers how to use them as drugs. The simple answer is that if they are intended to be used as drugs, they need to go through the premarket process to become drugs! 




 Herbal products can make some health claims, but they cannot claim to treat, cure, mitigate, or diagnose diseases or conditions. Any product that makes such a claim, be it herbal or otherwise, is a drug and needs premarket approval from the FDA.

Herbal products can't state a dosage because they cannot claim to treat, cure, mitigate, etc., and those claims are tied to dosages.

It's not that herbal products are being specially targeted-classifying things as drugs, cosmetics, devices, food, and supplements are fundamental aspects of the regulatory structure in the U.S., and products are defined by the claims they make. 




 This is a question for your lawyer. Generally, you cannot gain good title to stolen property through theft. Restitution is not the same paying for the items you stole. But, theoretically, the amount of restitution you would have to pay could have been lessened by the return of stolen goods (pre-trial, not now). 




 Respectfully, if you are claiming that DSHEA was passed at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry or that it unfairly limits/restricts/confines dietary supplements, you're mistaken. DSHEA was passed at the behest of the dietary supplement industry itself. It was the biggest legislative victory they could have hoped for-a massive giveaway to the industry.

Dietary supplements are exempt from the premarket approval safety and efficacy requirements of drugs, they are exempt from the premarket approval safety requirements of food, and they can make health claims that foods are not allowed to make.

Dietary supplements are not confined to a status. Food and drug law is entirely reliant upon classification as to what they are, classifications that are largely based on manufacturers' claims. Change the claim, change ingredients as needed, and you can become a drug or food.

After some bad publicity about the ingredients of supplements, some energy drink manufacturers voluntarily chose to reclassify their products from dietary supplement to food. This merely requires ensuring that the ingredients meet the safety requirements of food (generally recognized as safe, etc.) and changes the sort of claims the manufacturers can make about the product.

Note that supplement manufacturers don't want drug status. The whole point of operating in the dietary supplement space is to circumvent the requirements of demonstrating safety, efficacy, and going through the process of becoming an approved drug. If the maker of supplement X were to want to make a drug claim (as in X cures Y), they'd have to file a New Drug Application with the FDA, do clinical trials, there'll be a back and forth with the FDA on efficacy and safety, etc. The supplement sphere avoids all this. 




 This is the sort of escalation that occurs when judges are soft on perpetrators of picnic basket theft. 









 I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. If you are assuming that repealing DSHEA to restore the FDA's jurisdiction over dietary supplements would lead to an increase in their cost, I disagree and note that the cost of energy drinks is pretty much the same, whether they are currently classified as foods or as supplements. 




 Yes-the FTC enforces the relevant law against false and deceptive advertising, but they have limited resources and even then, can only take on a product once it is on the market making false or deceptive claims. Moreover, the FTC generally has to rely on court actions.

The FDA, on the other hand, can deal with unsafe ingredients before they make it to market, and can often get products off of shelves via administrative actions that do not require a lengthy court procedure. 




 Congress is right that there's a problem, but they should be blaming themselves for it. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 stripped the FDA of most regulatory oversight over dietary supplements. Drugs and food must be shown to be safe to be on the market. Not so for dietary supplements. Drugs must be shown to be effective to be on the market. Not so for dietary supplements.

Take energy drinks as an example. In your average grocery store cooler, you'll find cans of energy drinks that are regulated as food and others that are regulated as dietary supplements, side by side. The average consumer has no idea that most ingredients of the cans that say Nutritional Facts on the label have to be shown to be generally recognized as safe before going on the market, whereas the cans that say Supplement Facts have no assurance of safety.

 Thanks. :) And I'm with you on preferring a firmer fish.

I like my fish cooked all the way through-I was hoping sous vide could help me avoid having the outside be just right but the core not being cooked-but only just cooked through. 




 It wasn't so much a recipe as it was looking at the various charts out there of egg cooking times, picking a time, and putting the eggs, in shell, in the water bath.

I did a 65 egg, which made the yolk spreadable, almost jelly-like (and utterly delicious on brioche!). Left it in the water bath for about an hour. 




 That sounds tasty-thanks! 




 How do you all store your Anova when it's not in use? Do I need some sort of case or do I just stick it in a cabinet once its dry? 




 *nods* Thanks, okcukv. 




 I got my Anova this morning, and so the first thing I did was make sous vide eggs, which came out beautifully! Tonight, I tried to make salmon, and it came out with the texture of cat food and with what, I am guessing, might be the flavor of cat food too. I'm not sure what I did wrong (maybe everything, I don't know?).

I used frozen sushi-grade salmon from Whole Foods, put it directly in the water bath without thawing it in the fridge, set the water bath for 52C, and left it there for an hour.

Did I go wrong with the frozen salmon? Did I go wrong with the temperature? Did I leave it in there too long (I thought that it was hard to overcook things based on leaving it in the water bath for a sustained period of time?) I know that by putting it in the water bath from the frozen state, I didn't season it or flavor it ahead of time, but that wouldn't affect the texture or the deeply unpleasant flavor. 




 You don't read as many stories about cab drivers assaulting passengers because it happens too frequently to qualify as national news. 




 There are plenty of successful lawyers who were not on law journal. Your odds of being a successful lawyer drops significantly, however, if you find yourself before the Honor Board. It's just not worth getting disciplined by your school and potentially have trouble with the character and fitness committee. Do the right thing.

 Welcome to the Dartmouth family! /u/stepintomyd0j0 has good suggestions. My only addition is to note that L.L. Bean has an amazing return policy (AKA they let you return pretty much anything at any time). If you are unused to New England winters, I might suggest getting things from L.L. Bean so that if they turn out to not be warm enough, or a good fit, or otherwise to your liking/comfort, you can return them and get something else. 




 Yep! I had one 10 years ago back in my time working tech support for a university. An older professor came in with his PowerPC tower and said he had a broken cupholder-I was both horrified and excited to learn the legends were true. :P 




 Did you even read my comment? I agree that Israel, like any country, does things one might criticize, and that criticizing Israel is not a sign of anti-semitism. If one only criticizes Israel, anti-semitism may become a reasonable inference.

Russia's genocidal policies towards the Chechens eclipsed anything Israel has done towards Palestinians, and yet Roger Waters voiced no criticism of them and indeed, continues to perform in Russia. (Not to mention Russian persecution of homosexuals, current actions towards the Ukraine, the invasion of Georgia, the murder of journalists (such as Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, and Stanislav Markelov), etc.)

China's human rights violations are of such a scale, it is difficult to choose a place to begin. Given that Waters has invoked apartheid in his criticism of Israel, however, perhaps a good starting point is China's discrimination towards it rural workers as part of the hukou system. Many have described the hukou system as apartheid (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm , for example). China's actions towards Tibet could be said to be analogous to apartheid. And yet Waters voices no criticism of China. And Roger Waters performs in China. 




 Waters has repeatedly played in China and Russia. He played in Venezuela while Hugo Chavez was in power.

Criticizing Israel does not equal being anti-semitic. Criticizing ONLY Israel, however, and one has to wonder. 




 Ah! That makes sense. I hadn't realized that the Virginia tax rate included local taxes. 




 How are the taxes not as bad? I'd have to earn a quarter of a million dollars to pay the same tax rate in Maryland that I pay in Virginia? 









 Please don't down vote me into oblivion for saying thisI have a hard time visualizing math. But I looked at tax rates just the other day, and I was surprised that Virginia state income tax rate seems higher for me than Maryland would be.

Virginia's tax rate (unless I'm doing this wrong), for people earning over $17,000 a year, is 720+5.75% of the excess over $17000. Maryland's tax rate for people earning $3,000-$100,000 per year is $90+4.75% for the excess over $3,000.

To be taxed at the 5.75% Virginia is, I'd have to earn over $250,000 and it would only be 5.75% for the amount in excess over $250,000 (plus $12,700).

Am I missing something? (And again, that's not a rhetorical question, I'm truly wondering if I'm missing something?)

*EDITED to add the word Virginia in the last sentence of first paragraph. 




 Yay! I hope more schools move to that model. 




 I don't understand why property law is a required 1L course. All the other core classes cover area of law that one might practice in. Property Law The Class is just scraps of whatever couldn't be turned into its own class, like Wills and Estates, Real Estate, Taxation, etc., and so it encompasses almost nothing practical. A 2 week session covering black letter, common law claims like conversion, stolen property, trespass, etc. would be sufficient!

Property should be replaced by Administrative Law. Like the rest of the 1L core, Admin. is its own area of practice, and it is an area of practice that is a fundamental element of nearly every other area of law. I didn't take Admin. law until I went back for my LL.M., and in retrospect, I really regret not taking it as a 2L. There were so many upper-level courses I took as a 2L and 3L that were heavily admin. law based, and my understanding of them would have been so much better had I been given a fuller understanding of Chevron, Auer, Meade, Skidmore, etc. 




 It's doable, but only you can say if you're overextending yourself. How much sleep you'll need, how much study time you'll need, etc., those are the big things to consider, and nobody here can answer that for you.

0 debt would be an awesome thing. But it's also important that you get the very best grades you can, network at every law school event that puts you in touch with practitioners, etc. If you're coming into classes exhausted every day, that's not good. 




 Not to repeat myself, but Scalia's dissent Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center is the biggest bizarre shift in rationales, given the doctrinal importance of Auer and given that Auer was an unanimous decision that Scalia himself authored.

(There have been major logical inconsistencies in terms of Chevron, Meade, and Skidmore [and Auer] as well, but I will be fair and note that that problem doesn't fall just on Scalia's shoulders but on the shoulders of the entire Court.) 




 (See, for example, Scalia's dissent in Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center, where Scalia blasts the majority opinion in Auer v. Robbins without any acknowledgement that he wrote the darn opinion in Auer himself!) 




 On the other hand, his administrative law decisions have become increasingly erratic over time. This was not the first time he has, without explanation of how he has evolved on the matter or even why stare decisis shouldn't apply, criticized the natural consequence or the rule of an administrative law decision he authored. It's just the first time he misstated the facts of the case. 




 No, same price throughout. 




 Dorms vary greatly at Dartmouth. Some (like East Wheelock) can be spacious, others not so much. But friends and I always felt comfortable. :-)

And housing isn't guaranteed as far as I recall (*sigh* now I feel old-I don't remember these things), but so long as you don't change your D-plan at the last minute, you shouldn't have a problem getting housing. You most certainly are not expected to house offcampus or at a frat. Many do, but it certainly is not required/expected! 




 As a law student, in the Fall and Spring, I liked studying at the zoo. 




 Rand Paul gives two examples that he thinks demonstrates why the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished and both completely fail to support his argument. His example of the NYC rubber rooms with teachers NYC is waiting to fire has nothing to do with federal laws or regulations and everything to do with the structures NY and NYC established. That example is all on the State and city.

Senator Paul's wanting to pay some teachers more, some teachers less, and fire some teachers, also has nothing to do with federal funds, federal regulations, federal laws, or the U.S. Department of Education. That is also a matter of state and local politics/laws/regulations/contracts.

Senator Paul seems to be calling for federal funds to flow to state educational agencies and schools without any federal restrictions on how the funds can be used. Current federal restrictions on funds include allowability (money from a grant has to be used on allowable things that are reasonable/necessary for the grant's purposeno refitting the teacher's lounge with funds intended to help disadvantaged children, for example), accountability/transparency (states/schools must be able to account for how federal funds were spent, i.e. no money disappearing into a black hole), federal funds must supplement and not supplant state/local funds (federal funds are supposed to boost schools but not be a way for states to take money they would have spent on education and spend it elsewhere or lower taxes, etc.), etc.
No states or territories are required to accept federal education money, but if they take it, it comes with federal strings. It's not just a pool of free money to run out and buy every teacher and student an iPad.

The U.S. Department of Education plays no role in curriculum choices. The U.S. Department of Education plays no role in whether or not schools are unionized. The U.S. Department of Education has no role in hiring teachers, firing teachers, or their salaries. Education still IS a state and local matter. The U.S. Department's role in K-12 education is supplemental funds. Yes, the funds come with rules on how they can be spent. No, this doesn't make the U.S. Department of Education incompetent, evil, or unnecessary. 




 Gotcha. Yes, I agree.... DSHEA is a terrible law. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. It's just that saying that the FDA isn't required to oversee/verify efficacy sounds like they could do it but are choosing not to. 




 It's not that the FDA allows it, it's that the FDA is unable to prohibit it. (First Amendment.) 




 Not quitebecause of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA isn't ALLOWED to oversee or verify the efficacy or safety of many dietary supplements and their ingredients. It's not the FDA's fault. 




 Government bodies with bureau in the name are often a subdivision of a larger agency. The FBI's parent agency is the Department of Justice. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is part of the Department of the Interior. That said, the National Park Service is also part of the Department of the Interior. That the one has bureau in the name and one doesn't has no legal significanceit's purely a question of naming. 

The IRS is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Patent and Trademark Office is part of the Department of Commerce,  the Food and Drug Administration is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (and prior to 1940 was part of the Department of Agriculture), etc. It's just the name that Congress chose to give them.

All of the examples you gave, by the way, ARE agencies. They all have statutes that outline their authority and area of influence. That the FBI doesn't have agency in its name and the CIA does has no legal significance. Both are agencies as a matter of administrative law.

 Not to be pedantic, but the FCC is an agency, not a committee.

Agencies have the power to regulate in the field delegated to them by Congress, but statutes trump regulations. Agencies get to interpret statutes and their interpretation of vague statutes is generally deferred to by the courts, but if the statute is clear, it is what it is.

So yes, Congress can certainly pass legislation that would ensure net neutrality. Would they? Almost certainly not-too many legislators are in telecom companies' pockets. 




 Yes, as others have said, you can (and need) to get it inspected before you get it registered. You do not need to have the title to get it inspected.

(I got my car inspected in VA a few months before I moved there, just to make sure there were no surprises with my car.)

 No different than what's said at the [NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-inmate-conviction-overturned-1980-behind-bars-article-1.1761084) or [The Root](http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/04/this_inmate_s_conviction_was_overturned_in_1980_but_he_s_still_in_prison.html?wpisrc=burger). The real fail is that only a few papers have covered this horror show so far. 














 Reading the [NYT article by Adam Liptak](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04felony.html) the Alternet article references, Ryan Holle was aware that his car was going to be used as part of a robbery. The article states that Holle himself testified "that he had been told it might be necessary to 'knock out' Jessica Snyder."

If one wishes to debate the appropriateness of the felony murder rule, we can have that debate, but it is intellectually dishonest for Charles Grodin to present this case as though Holle had no knowledge his car would be used for a crime. 




 Crystal City and Pentagon City are pretty comparable, but Pentagon City has more immediate access to greenery through the park at 15th and South Joyce Street. Also, Pentagon City has the benefit of a 24 hour grocery store being right there. (It's one metro stop away if you live in Crystal City, but personally, I like being able to walk to Harris Teeter.)

If Pentagon City has the benefit of having Harris Teeter, Crystal City has the benefit of more upscale dining options.

It's one metro stop (or a 5 minute cab ride) between the two, so, really, either one is a good spot to live in. 




 Really? I mean, I wouldn't hang out at the mallway too many touristsbut I never have a problem getting too and from the metro, and the mall food court is convenient when I want to pick up something quick and cheap on my way home.  




 The Archstone building is REALLY close to the metro. And the Pentagon City Mall is right above the metro stop, so, that's right there too (not just Macy's, Nordstroms, Apple, and all the usual mall stores, but don't forget the convenience of the food court, which includes a Panera, McDonalds, Chipotle, Subway, etc.). You'd be right across the street from Costco, CVS, CPK, Chevy's, etc., a block away is Rite Aid, World Market, Noodles   Co, a thai place, a sports bar, an Irish pub,  and one block beyond that is Harris Teeter (grocery store) and Bed, Bath, and Beyond. You'd also be in walking distance of the Aurora Hills branch of the Arlington library, which is small, but they are quick to get in books from the rest of the Arlington library system if you put in a request.

I'm not sure what iidesune is talking about-it's an easy commute with no need to switch to the Red Line. You'd take the Blue Line from Pentagon City to Farragut West. It's five stops, and would take you around 19 minutes.

Do you have any specific questions about Pentagon City I could help with? 




 I do remember Spitzer stepping down. I remember Weiner stepping down. I don't remember Senator Vitter (R) stepping down after embroilment in a prostitution scandal (or scandals). Because he didn't. I don't remember Former SC Governor Mark Sanford (R) stepping down after sneaking away to Argentina, without telling anyone and therefore leaving his state without anyone in charge, to see his mistress, who he has since married, and oh, right, he's now in Congress.

Senator Vitter and Congressman Sanford both bill themselves as family values Republicans. Sanford referred to his own cheating on his wife (and by not following procedures to put the Lt. Governor in charge in his absence, cheating on his State) by saying "I think we all need grace and we all need love" but that love we all need doesn't apply to the LGQBT community because he is opposed to same sex marriage. Senator Vitter, who engaged in regular sex with prostitutes (allegedly with a diaper involved), is also an opponent of same-sex marriage.

Don't hump my leg and tell me you tripped, Senator and Congressman.

 This notice/FAQ does not require notice and comment. It's not a regulation. It's non-regulatory guidance. Other than that, you're not wrong, but you're giving people like /u/paleh0rse an inaccurate impression of the process.

This is non-regulatory guidance. It is not binding. It does not have the force of law in and of itself. It is, however, a statement outlining how the IRS intends to carry out its responsibilities and use its authority under existing law.

The IRS is stating its position that under existing law, bitcoins are treated as property for federal tax purposes, etc. If someone does not follow the guidance, the IRS cannot punish them for not following the notice, but they CAN attempt to punish them for violating the statutes and regulations that the IRS based the notice on.

This isn't a proposal. This is a statement of what the IRS believes the existing laws and regulations require and how the IRS will proceed. If you disagree with this interpretation, one can certainly make the argument that the IRS is wrong, but I sure wouldn't want to be the test case. 




 I can't EL5 (administrative law is a bit more complex than Schoolhouse Rock), but I can explain it. Administrative agencies all derive their power from some sort of enacting legislation (also known as an organic statute). The enacting legislation creates an agency and defines its authority and role. (There can be multiple statutes that govern an agency.)

Agencies are essentially delegated power through the enacting legislation over a certain sphere. In the example of the IRS, their sphere of delegated authority is taxation.

Congress does not need to decide the legal status of Bitcoin first because it has delegated the authority to make that determination to the IRS. An agency cannot go against the express will of Congress as reflected in the plain language of a statute. If, however, a statute is ambiguous, it is the role of an agency to fill in the gaps of the legislation.

 Arguing that publicizing Gox's losses is what killed Gox is akin to arguing that efforts to expose Bernie Madoff as running a ponzi scheme is what caused his investors to lose their money.

Publicizing the issues stopped the scheme from continuing on a little longer, but that's not the same as a rescue! Accepting deposits but not making withdrawals put Mt. Gox on the same level as a ponzi scheme, and no merger or buyout was going to be able to fix that issue.

 Hi all. I was wondering if any of you know of any good magic shows for adults in the DC area? I was thinking of going to Glenn Gary's Parlor Magic Show at some point, but never got around to it, and it has apparently since closed.

Are there any other regularly scheduled magic acts anywhere? 




 Thanks for the information! :) I'm really looking forward to this. One last question. Does the VIP pass only allow getting in the front of the line for one guest (not me as the one guest, but rather, is it only good to get to the front of the line to see, say, Ernie Hudson but not Ernie and Dirk Benedict)? 




 This looks really awesome. I've never been to a con before, but I think I'm going to go to this one. My question, though, is which ticket should I get? If I don't get the Geekend VIP pass, does that mean it is harder to get autographs/photo-ops? Will there be enough priority panel seating at each panel for VIPs to be reasonably assured of getting a spot?  




 When I was doing writing coaching, I charged time and a half for last minute jobs... 




 Which isn't to say that I'm fully on your side. :P I am perfectly comfortable with people being expelled based solely on allegations, but it is based on the totality of the evidence as part of a fair an equitable process.

Fairness is binarya process is either fair or unfair. Is there anyone ready to stand up for expulsions as part of an unfair process? 




 Childress's argument before the panel seems to be that those found guilty of sexual misconduct should be expelled without going through a fair and equitable process. That expulsions should occur on what school administrators "know". The problem, of course, is that what we "know" and what we can prove in a fair and equitable process are often different, and many mistakes are made when people focus on the former. 




 Good grief. Inside Higher Education quotes Linda Farstein as an analyst/consultant, with no mention of her history as a New York prosecutor A checkered career at best, given her appalling conduct in the Central Park Jogger case where she abused her position to help railroad five teenagers into wrongful convictions for rape. Years later, she showed no remorse or ability to objectively review evidence, by opposing the NY DA's recommendation to vacate the wrongful convictions.

Which isn't to say that Ms. Childress should be judged by the ideological company she keeps, but I am appalled by her words that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process. I am all for expelling students after an evidence-based, fair and equitable process. An allegation is evidence. An allegation may even be all the evidence required in some cases. But the notion that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process is probably the same sort of internal justification that allowed Fairstein to work so hard and putting (and then keeping) five innocent kids in prisonher job came to be about representing victims instead of doing justice and being the People's representative. 




 Did Sonny Curtis or Bobby Fuller actually rob people with a six-gun? 




 I had one of those when working at a university help desk 11 or so years ago... Until an older professor came in with his tower PC with a broken cup holder, I thought those stories were just a myth! 




 Deborah Lipstadt's 1993 book "Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust" is an interesting look at your question. It's been a few years since I've read it, but if I recall correctly, the reporters who were aware what was going on early on were initially disbelieved because there were rumors of German atrocities in WWI that turned out to be false. Some people, including editors, thought that what they were hearing were more of the same false rumors. 




 Which is rather irksome in an age where money is deemed to be speech when it comes from corporations, but federal employees can't post forward a fundraising email from the DNC, RNC, etc. to their closest friends. 









 I found the E E to be really unhelpful for Admin. It is unusual for me to recommend a casebook as a supplement, but Andrew Popper's "Administrative Law: A Contemporary Approach" is laid out in an easy-to-use format, akin to an outline. I'd suggest spending the $40 to rent this for a term over $40 on the E E. http://www.amazon.com/Administrative-Law-Contemporary-Interactive-Casebooks/dp/0314255575/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1391721533 sr=8-1 keywords=andrew+popper 




 I had no idea that moving one's car to a different space wasn't enough to avoid getting a ticket, so, I thought this article might be helpful for others, too! 









 Yes, it can. Exact criminal charge depends on the jurisdiction. Could be vandalism, criminal mischief, or other things along those lines.
