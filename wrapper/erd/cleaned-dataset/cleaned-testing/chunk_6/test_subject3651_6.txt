 awesome article! 




 I totally agree with you! Precisely the reason I posted the article--Chris Matthews has always downplayed Bernie and it's nice to see that he has stopped that rhetoric (at least for now). Hopefully *now*, he can rightfully acknowledge why Bernie has so much support, even though the rest MSM has yet to recognize it.*^avidly ^waiting* 









 Thank you for being so open and honest! I'm sure that this will help many people out there that have or are struggling with the same thing. :) 




 It is people like you that keeps us loving our jobs, so thank you! 


































 Totally agree, the article doesn't really depict feminist issues--for they are issues that effect everyone 




 Thank you!!!! 





























 I don't even have a Twitter account, but I'll make one for this. :)
