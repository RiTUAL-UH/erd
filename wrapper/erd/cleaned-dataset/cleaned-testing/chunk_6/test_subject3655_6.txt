 Cars or guitars. Probably cars, because if I ever wanted some guitars I could just sell one of my many Lamborghinis. 




 When a really talk guy sits in front of you. It's the worst because you can't do anything about it. I mean it's not their fault, you can't ask them to shrink a bit for you. But it also sucks because you can't see. You just have to stick it out and see only the George Clooney parts of Gravity. 




 Despite any of that, the popularity of the NFL is rising at a ridiculous rate, especially internationally, despite it's horrible management. Hockey, rugby and lacrosse are also gaining popularity despite being just as, if not more, dangerous than football (maybe not lacrosse). Wether it's liked or not, the NFL is in it for the long haul. 




 I feel very confident in betting against you on this. Unfortunately, at this rate neither of our money will be worth shit in 100 years. 




 Buzzfeed lists. 




 I've pretty much given up hope, and it's depressing as fuck. 




 TV, or at least we were a few years ago we were, and are still coming down from our prime. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Office, Entourage, Lost, How I Met Your Mother, Mad Men, True Detective, Dexter, House of Cards, American Horror Story, the list goes on and on. I think in the future we will look back and realize just how good we had it. 




 That sounds like quite a well. 




 I've got some great news for you. 




 ...what's wrong with shoes? 




 I love this sub. 




 Show off 




 I'm not sure why, but when ever me and my friends smoke outside we come up with really catchy chants based off of whatever we're doing. Needless to say "Baked and naked" will make an appearance at our next sesh. Your legend shall go down in short term memory at the very least. Unlike the others though, this one will not be based off of our activities. 




 [Gah] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37d36t/what_should_the_first_human_on_mars_say/crloy26) 




 I get sad when people hate on people who drive nice cars (I don't think I have much of a bias, I drive a nine year old Nissan and I'm very content with it). Although there are those people out there, for the most part people don't buy cars based on what others think but rather based on wether or not they personally like them. One of my best friends owns a new Corvette, it's a beautiful car. He's not rich, he lives in an apartment smaller than mine and saved up for 4 years to get it. He's not a dick on the road, he's probably the best driver I know and would never drive the lest bit recklessly leste he put his precious Chevrolet in danger. And he didn't buy it because he's materialistic, he doesn't care what others think of it, he just loves cars and is willing to invest in a hobby he cares about. Yet people still assume they know enough to judge him based on his means of transportation. I mean wouldn't it be wrong for someone judged you based on your hobby or interests? 




 Don't use car stereotypes, a shitty driver can drive any vehicle. I've seen plenty of people that think they own the road in Hondas and Nissans. 




 I'm not the least bit rich, but I live in an EXTREMELY wealthy area. I personally don't want to live in a very big house, but they impress me none the less. As a lover of architecture and exotic cars, I often drive through some of the nicer neighborhoods just to see the houses. Many of them are truly beautiful. 




 Well that's ignorant. 




 Everything is obviously hard to master, but in my opinion martial arts isn't any harder to 'learn' than most anything else. I can think of lots of things that were more challenging for me. 




 In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.

Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line.

 The dark nature of these comments coupled with the seemingly light fluffiness of Harry Potter confuses me... 




 I'm now realizing how wrong I was about considering myself a bookworm after seeing the legenths some of these people's responses and deeming them all too long to actually read...

 Am I just fucking stoned, or is there a swing on the inside of the house?

 What would get you to a [5] for about 45 min using a bong or a joint will probably get you to a solid [7] for at least three hours. The effects will be delayed about an hour though. 




 I would use 2 grams. Save that last one and smoke it about an hour after drinking the tea. If everything goes right, you should be launched into fucking orbit.

EDIT: This is based off of my experience with fire crackers, but I can't imagine it being much different, if different at all. 




 Be sure to report back when you do!

 Kung Futography. Nailed it. 




 Now I'm just confused.

EDIT: Ohh. Wow, there must be quite a few baffled tree and marijuana enthusiasts out there. 




 Hmm, now I just need to explain why I ordered part of a trumpet in the mail...

EDIT: The best excuse I've come up with is I'm inventing a new instrument. That's a dead give away in itself.

 How do I screen shot this? I patiently await the day when I can rejoice in triumph as you eat your hat. Triumph because of the legalization, the hat eating thing is just a bonus. 




 Wait, waiting? I thought the title meant it was already decriminalized? Like passed tense? 




 Gotta say, I really miss the giant script 'Patriots' in the end zone. That looked absolutely sick. The new one is okay, but the old one was really unique to the Patriots. This one is a little generic in comparison.

 And if you do happen to do that, DEFINITELY don't do it a second time. And if you do do it a second time DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY don't do it a third time. But I mean seriously, what are the chances of that? 




 [James Spader] (http://youtu.be/g0m3lfCGgO0). Not just for his voice, but for his intensity. Imagine Ultron, the fucking Lizard King, giving you a play by play as you drive to work. Otherwise dull activities are now a thousand times more fascinating and intense than you ever thought possible.

EDIT: I'm not sure why, but I thought this was a celebrity that was supposed to narrate your life for a day. My answer remains the same.

 Pineapple and milk. Anybody who's never done it needs to try this ASAP. It will blow your mind. 




 You must have gone to semicollege. 




 I've traveled very extensively, not once did I ever wonder why I didn't hear the phrase 'hoagie' along the way. Accept for in Sandwich, Massachusetts, but only because I think Hoagie, Massachusetts would be a much cooler name. 




 You weren't very drunk. 




 Capitalizing Every Word Can Melt Your Brain! 




 Those silly pills that promise "four inches of extra growth". I for one would love to be four inches taller, but I'm not sure I'm willing to invest in a merchant who advertises on the shady underbelly of the internet. 




 Yet* 




 Ha...what 




 If you'll excuse me I have a, uh...science experiment to do. 




 I always considered a hoagie a little different from a sub or hero or whatever though. A league of their own, if you will.  




 I'm not a driver, but my friend who has a kid bet me $150 that I couldn't take care of a child. Naturally, the only way to get to the bottom of it was to put a watermelon in a diaper and carry it around all day as if it was a real baby. I think you see where Im going with this. Anyhow, it was a drizzly Tuesday, I was taking Mel to the library to get some studying done. I go down there all the time and pretty much never see anyone I know, so I wasn't worried about being judged. What I didn't account for however is that this was the week of finals. As soon as I looked out the window I already saw four or five people I knew. EVERYONE was there. I made the snap decision to abandon Mel in the cab (I know, I'm a monster). We said our good byes, and that was it. The best part though, was as soon as I exited the cab someone else immediately got in it and it drove away. I can only assume it was an incredible, confusing ride. 




 That thing from Shark Tale where they clean the whales. 




 This morning both of my parents left me lunch money without the other knowing they had. Muhahaha.

 Wait...mischief night isn't a thing everywhere else?? I honestly didn't recognize this as New Jersey, I thought that was just a universal thing...

 The two NSFW's is what spiked my curiosity. It's not working? 




 What is it? 




 If we're going to look that far into it, I think a good few of them would be a bit caught up on the U.S. being a country. 




 [Hey Ya!] (http://youtu.be/PWgvGjAhvIw) is actually surprisingly depressing considering how upbeat it is. [Under the Bridge] (http://youtu.be/lwlogyj7nFE) is also very sad. Read the lyrics on the video, its all about being along and using heroine to fill the void. As far as just plain sad though, there is nothing compared to [Henry Russel's Last Words] (http://youtu.be/i_shhl06szA). So fucking sad. 




 [Heart covering Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven at the Kennedy Center Honors] (http://youtu.be/LFxOaDeJmXk). Fucking incredible. Chills every time at 5:47. 




 I don't listen to them, but LMFAO definitely had their moment in the sun and then disappeared from the face of the Earth. They were in the Superbowl, and then poof, gone. 




 Incubus is still very popular. 




 They released a Christmas ablum not to long ago. I was honestly hoping that would be their return to the mainstream punk rock community.

For a second there I thought I stumbled onto the wrong sub. 




 Why did you link to the person rather than the desk?

EDIT: Oh.

EDIT 2: Oh? I thought it was supposed to be funny because Verne Troyer is little, so the little desk makes sense for him. I had no idea there was a real desk, let alone a stolen desk. I feel like every time I'm done thinking about this I have a sudden realization that opens a whole new can of worms. I have checked in to stoner purgatory.  




 Of all the great pictures of Snoop Dogg... 




 Plentiful downvotes for that misleading hoodwinker! 




 OP strongly implies it.
