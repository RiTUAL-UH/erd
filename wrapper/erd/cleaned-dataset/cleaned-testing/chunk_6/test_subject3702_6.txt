 I think that what their demoing is quite impressive... But I honestly hate this design. The page loaded *incredibly* slow for me, and kind of jacked up my browser. On re-sizing, the site entirely reloads everything. 

And also, what the crap is the deal with that map? It's a UX nightmare. The scroll bar disappears? I can't scroll up? I can't scroll down wtf... No website should do that without prompting a user first. 

I like the mobile version much better. 




 Snow, by Orhan Pamuk. It's not the futuristic kind of dystopia.  




 lol, I live on NE MLK. It's fun. 




 Are you Emily? 




 Can you please explain what exactly you are talking about? I remember watching th OR kickstarter and thinking, "that might be cool when I'm old..." and that wasn't *that* long ago. With what you have right now, do you actually feel like you're sitting in a movie theater? 




 maybe that's true for today's artists, but A LOT of MC's/hip hop artists from 15-25 years ago are legitimate thugs. 




 yeah, it took like 15mins there, and some douchebag was already using setInterval 




 Plot twist,  alternate universe 




 yeah, exactly what I was thinking. I got kind of excited about the api, started looking for the npm install, and then saw a payment options. Seeyahlater.  




 so where's your resume for being a "twisted developer"? 




 hell yeah 




 A quick question for you:

I have several decent projects on github, and have been contributing to a handful of open source projects for a little while now.
I have been rigorously focusing on my javascript developing skills, and really want to get a job in the field. 

I've recently become comfortable enough with my skills to start looking, but EVERYTHING seems to require a higher education degree... is it even worth applying to these jobs? Or is it likely that my resume will get thrown into the rejection pile?

How should I address that issue? 




 Yeah, this is the thing I don't get... I was having this conversation three days ago at a bar. Bitcoin is so fucking volatile, I mean it fucking crashed even worst in summer... 




 i.e. sarcasm 




 why? source? 




 I hate that subreddit 









 "dude, let's make paninis"

"woah dude, we got paninis" 




 damn... that really sucks. How long have you been working there? Is there a chance that you can find a job in the same field but with people more or less in your age group?

It seems like a pretty menial thing, but I've been in that situation before... Not being able to identify with you're coworkers other than "hey, he's just some guy," can make work life miserable.   




 girl you're so groovy, I want you to know.
slicing up eye balls! I want you to know! 




 "This next song is called, 'I really love my banjo'" 




 prolly just ringworm. which isn't actually a worm 




 So, portland every time it snows 




 It's really great,  until you have to start going to work. And then you become angry.  




 Calm down buddy. Its going to be ok 




 ok guys, no kidding around now. I just deleted system32 on my dads computer and he's really pissed. HOW DO I FIX THIS! 




 can u post orginal instructions? I need to play this game! 




 that username... A-Are you aubrey plaza? 




 op plz 




 there it is! 




 break world record 




 ah, the fair and balanced approach. 




 but is there a bunch of that hairy stuff still stuck to the corn? OP plz respond. 




 that's quite amazing 




 Its something that's been used a handful of times in this thread.  They haven't been clear. But I would really be interested in how they quantify  spiritual. 




 You do realise that it's insane to here a researcher saying this,  right?   




 I don't think that pete from the street was actually a physicist. 




 dude... some people can't help it. 




 when did you start yelling at horses, and how long have you been doing it for? 




 me four! 




 Wow, it looks perfectly cooked. Duck meat is supposed to be that color and the turkey is white.  




 Apocalypse Now 




 I want someone to photoshop a picture of saturn on top of the whale. 




 "my human took me on his last walk today, miss you buddy :'(" 




 that's not a happy ending at all. 




 first thought. 




 /r/hailcorporate 




 Eh 




 This is kind of depressing to me. Is it really looked down upon to swear in the office? I've been a cook for many years and am about to  begin the transition into office  life. I'm so used to saying "fuck" and "cunt", its going to feel bizarre. 




 I would have laughed 




 I want to know why this doesn't need a nsfw tag, but the kid who posted pictures of his awesome 3d models had to censor his picture of a naked lady,  because it had been removed from /r/pics previously 




 when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow   exclude people. so create.
-why the lucky stiff 




 It's already happened, and been accepted, with the word nigger. There just happens to be a certain context in which it's use is acceptable.  




 in fact, words do take on new definitions. It would seem to be happening to faggot. 




 That's ol' uncle tommy for you. 




 you need to move out of there, real quick-like, dude.

Laetiporus gilbertsonii grows in coastal western North America, from Oregon to Baja California... It is morphologically indistinguishable from Laetiporus sulphureus, but the two species will not "mate" in culture, making them biologically distinct. 




 You're the man for making this website 




 Really interested, how did he do this exactly? As in, what does he do for work? Did he know people out in Montana? or did he just up and leave and find a job when he was out there?

Lot's of dorritos and mountain dew. Seemed a little fishy to me. 




 don't worry bro, he knows people. 




 Haha, jeez this really blew up.  It was just a joke, playing off of the angry short guy stereotype. I don't think that I'm more aggressive than any of my taller friends, honestly.  




 I know, Im 5'4", a dude, and have absolutely no hormone probs. JUST ANGER PROBLEMS 




 Full Metal Alchemist in-depth RPG.

Need I say more? This would be so fucking awesome!  




 Can I hire you to write some pitches for me? 




 i don't think he can 




 I don't really know what you were saying... 




 so are you saying that disease didn't exist until recently? 




 I read these two comments as if a preacer were reading gospel 




 Wait, I don't get it... If you let her watch you guys fuck, why don't you just let her join in? I mean, the awkward part's already over. 




 Haha, I know. But in all fairness, I was a bit of a troll. Just because I know that a lot of people think it's too spicy. Which is obviously incorrect. 

I still love it though.  




 Wait... I skimmed the article, but I've always been under the impression that a male lion would win easily against a tiger. They have natural armor covering the top and bottom of their necks. 

 




 I'm sorry, but 20 hours a day is absurd. How many days a week are you working 20 hours a day? if you were to work two back to back 20-hour shifts, there would be four hours of down time between forty hours of work. assuming that you slept for all  of those hours, you'd still only be sleeping for four hours in a night. There is no possible way you could be doing this for more than three days at a time, unless you are some kind of savant. 

and three days at a time would be pushing it.

Edit:
I don't want to sound like an asshole or anything... It's just, a 20-hour work day is something very unheard of, and I'm just assuming is hyperbole. I could be wrong though. 




 but then it's time to fight. 




 This becomes a defense when you live with roomates that like to turn up the heat to 70 all day. 

"It's not even that cold."

"You're just trying to show off!!!"

"No I just don't want to pay lot's of god damn money!" 




 nope! she was bragging! How Pathetic! back to the many important things im doing at home... by myself... 




 I know man. Like when people try and say Sriracha is spicy.  




 I complain about how little sleep I get at times. But that's not because I'm busy. I just legitimately have problems sleeping. 




 he was answering a jeapordy question. 




 The quest is to get to work on time. You consider yourself a veteran. You've been through the worst of the bumper to bumper traffic. You have averted many crashes. You know to check the traffic report *before* you get on the highway. You have a stash of whatever the fuck you need to get through a long goddamn commute. It's been a long time on this road... 

and then one day, some teen/mother/father/asshat, driving far too recklessly decides to switch lanes too early, or to read the most recent text message, or look for a cigarette lighter, pet his fucking cat is too distracted and fucking slams right the fuck into you.

best case scenario, you're late for work. worst, you have some debilitating injury. even worst is some kind of life changing can't walk talk in broken syllables kind of thing, but even worst is that you could fucking die.  

at whatever end, someone like you could argue: well, techinically, they **were** the better driver. But who the fuck cares at that point. You're still late for work/have brain damage/ are dead.  




 so sad 




 Those articles are awesome dude!  




 Jesus. This thread has certainly been a rollercoaster ride,  eh? 




 Who the fuck is downvoting this?
