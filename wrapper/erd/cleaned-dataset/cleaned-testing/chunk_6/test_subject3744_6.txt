 US heavy bombs are all now gps guided, they don't need to carpet bomb like vietnam anymore. B-52s can hit a separate target with each bomb it has at the same time.

In WW2 the US didn't have precision bombs. Altitude and wind currents would miss targets by miles. That is why whole cities were bombed. The only cities that were bombed were considered industry that supported the Axis,  cities weren't carelessly bombed at random.

 Forza 2 in the early races where you know you are going to lose to the fastest car. I would spin them out in the first corner and just relax the rest of the race. 




 I was going to say it was a military guy from Texas. The driver looks to be wearing a cowboy hat.

 I could tell it was in California because on/off ramps for freeways almost all look the same. I actually thought OP pic was in SoCal at first.

 Why would OSHA even show up to something like this? They usually only show up when somebody gets hurt.

 The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.

Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media, The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.

The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[4] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[5] although it retains operational headquarters in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham.

Company have a bad name? Just rename it and move it to a new location.

 You were right.

 Sounds like something my ex would do. 




  but I do believe it's what was going on in the video since he reaches out to the drivers door to unlock the back one.

Did we watch the same video? 




 "They did not know the seriousness of the situation but the 911 call that came in by the suspect basically stated he planned to commit suicide by igniting his vehicle with himself inside, said Commander Wright.

 I'm guessing after they attach the cable to the deck the pilot gives it more more power and lets the winch pull it down? That way when the aft starts rising the helicopter will rise with it? When the aft drops back down it pulls the heli with it?

Investigators say the man used a cigarette lighter to ignite gas fumes when he got back into his car.

"My initial impression is based on the fact he was at a gas station, it was probably gasoline, we got some samples we took from inside the car and will send out to the state arson lab to see what exactly burned up inside there, said AFD Capt. Andy Reardon.

  I have to say that I liked the other ones better. This was too blatantly political for my taste.

Hopefully they are going to attack both sides in the same way because they are pretty heavy handed. The Mitch McConnell video is the same.

This video is part of the first 3 they made, probably testing the waters on what they can say. The yoga guy was made only yesterday. In the comment section they are asking who they should make one for next. Hopefully they get more neutral as they make more videos. 




 Done

 Make something that is worth a dollar and they will pay for it. 




 Could also be an old gold mine. We won't know until OP breaks laws and opens those doors. 




 Wrote this for a deleted comment to expand on this comment.

 You local gas station pumps don't give you the amount of gas that you paid for, you realize this and report it to the county. They send out the county weight and measurements department and test it. They find out what you say is true. They forward it to the US weight and measurements and now that gas station has to answer to the US government and the county government as well.. 




 The hardware store had most of the best killing weapons. The sickle was the best, lasted longer than the rest. That drilling thingymajig only lasted for about 15 seconds before you lost it. 




 In the celebrity world, once you are labeled "odd" it really doesn't matter anymore. Do what you want and your career heads in the direction the public chooses.

 This is so great but i want to downvote it just because of shia and his pr team. 




 OP is a grumpy old man 




 Any news articles about it? 




 Any kind of utility like cable wouldn't venture very far from a street. OP says this is on a trail,  i would say it is for drainage since they obviously don't care water can get inside. 




 Where did you find it? 




 That part of Nevada is very heavily mined, wonder if that has something to do with it. Would imagine many miners from Colorado have transplanted there.

 OP i know this kind of advice really hurts but both of these comments are really great advice. Find something to do as a family that all of you can enjoy together without having to worry about anyone else. 

Find a group that includes other parents with autistic kids. Hopefully find some friends within that group that can relate to your family. I'm sure they can help with a vacation that can suit your family and needs.

 Don't think looking at their own reflection is a good example. Maybe kittens that have never seen a mirror before react to the reflection but that is just their nature running into another cat they don't recognise. I've never had any of my cats after their first experience with a mirror react that way the next time they experience it. My cat Pizza loves to sleep in the bathroom, and most of the time when you come in he will look at you through the mirror. When i start getting close enough to him he will turn his head and look at me directly.

Wasn't there a "Through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman" episode where they were talking about when humans become self conscious? One of the big factors was recognizing themselves in a mirror?

 ok sorry about that should have read the rules.

 English is good enough for a GED in the US.

Man on the car = Man in the car

If he was on the car he would be on top of the car.

The man is inside the car.

 Their whole job involves paperwork, having to do one more report isn't going to make their job harder. 




 Yup downvoting because someone has the opposite opinion. Every once in a while i will get in and out and it basically is just another fast food burger that tastes slightly better. 




 Would have to agree, i also live in SoCal but i'd rather find a mom and pop place for a burger instead. 




 I don't really like in and out, maybe because i've had it my whole life.

 I'm on your side, but this is how the system works.

I've experienced first hand 




 Whoever programmed his speech box made it change anything he says about "kill me" to "feed me a pea."

 The system works on bribes, down to the smallest business. I buy cardboard boxes from company A because they are cheap, but company B gives me tickets to great seats at my local sporting events with a matched price, so i buy from them instead.
