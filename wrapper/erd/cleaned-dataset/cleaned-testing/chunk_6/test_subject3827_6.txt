 And IIRC they said in an episode of Good Morning America after the trailer came out that the planet seen *was* Tatooine... 




 Reported. 




 Jon! 




 Cause there is no actual info about it I just want to know

(see, no shitpost) 




 Thanks 




 What's the science behind that? 









 Most/all of the deleted scenes are on YouTube as well 




 That scene in The Office where David Brent is getting ready for an interview and he rubs the perfume sample off a magazine onto his face. 




 My god, you were right! 




 Citizen Kane (1941) - Often looked at as one of the best and most influential movies of all time.

The Star Wars Original Trilogy (1977, 1980, 1983) - Enjoyable, emotional, action packed sci-fi movies with some revolutionary special effects.

Jaws (1975) - Well written, well directed, well acted. One of the best movies of all time.

Jurassic Park (1993) - Dinosaurs!!

Singin' in the Rain (1952) - Hilarious and well performed. Something there for everybody. 




 [The Shining](http://youtu.be/TgCejsyS0t8) 




 Good point 




 I don't see any reason why they would change that 




 I think Pixar could make an excellent movie from that 




 A 2D animated Star Fox show, in the style of either classic Hanna Barbera cartoons or Genndy Tartakovsky 




 The only thing that makes some sense is the release date  




 Yeah, that would probably sound better 




  the female 




 I don't wanna fall into the circlejerk, but Transformers is badly directed, badly acted, and overall badly made, while Mad Max is able to do most of those things well. 




 Because one does it better 




 Nintendo made a mistake mentioning this so early. It's not coming for a *while,* and people are talking about it like it's right around the corner. There are plenty of Wii U games that are yet to come. 




 Yeah, having the whole series on iTunes would be a big deal - it's the perfect compromise between Hulu and the DVD set, really. 




 I thought it was hilarious - no where near as good as 1, but it was perfectly fine 




 Ah, I play it where $75 is placed in "the pot" at the beginning of the game and only payments like taxes go in.  




 But it was in the official Star Wars magazine - you don't think that's a little weird? 




 Step 1 was 6 years ago? To be honest, I think The Love Guru kind of ruined the chance of him having a starring role anytime soon. 









 Mike Myers 




 Was the highest grossing movie ever until Star Wars... 




 You're still paying money for it...

Move along 




 Yeah, that makes a lot more sense than spending $40 on one now instead of waiting 2 months and buying a full set for the same price... 




 Depends on the price, I might get one. 




 Cable television costs money if I remember correctly... 




 I'm familiar with it 




 I think the prequels (at least Episode 3) are worth watching for some cool sequences, and if you're interested in the back story. 




 Sure 




 I mean for actual effects specifically, not buildings and cars - a battle with lots of robots and laser beams would work better with CGI, like in the Avengers, but I'm not suggesting that it should be 100% blue screened. 




 I'm not trying to get you angry, but this was just a pointless post. 




 I'm not trolling - not trying to be mean, but this isn't really news to anyone. 




 Well Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg with The Adventures of Tintin 




 Please, don't talk about it like its some low-budget risky indie flick. It's basically guaranteed to make money, and a sequel will come no matter what.  




 Yes  




 Well I guess that's not taking into account the hundreds of millions of dollars it made... 




 Why? 




 Really? There are so many places where CGI works better *and* looks better than practical effects.  




 Yeah, but now it exists and people use it often. Your point? 




 Not necessarily. 




 Totally - people talk about it like its some revolutionary masterpiece, but other than a few good performances and action sequences, there's nothing that makes it stand out. 




 It's a test image that was left in the background of a few frames. Really unnoticeable, but look it up. 




 I didn't mean to imply that he should go and create a new show, I meant the characters in his style would be interesting to see. 




 Probably  




 Let me guess - Mad Max, Interstellar, The Avengers, Inception... 




 The Dark Knight - there are *definitely* movies that deserve a stop ahead of it, like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Lawrence of Arabia. I don't think it's a bad film, but it's not anywhere near a 9 in my book.  




 I wouldn't - I know I can get it cheaper elsewhere  




 Yeah, I wouldn't, just the idea of getting one came to my mind after hearing about that. 




 Now that GameStop has retro consoles for sale, which one is worth getting? There are an equal number of games I would wanna play on both the N64 and the GameCube, but which one would I get the most enjoyment out of? Which one will I want to play more?

I'd love some help with this! 




 Hasn't this been news for a while? I know the Open Road thing is recent info, but the title is kind of misleading. 




 Why would you share it? 




 Not always  




 Yes, but *a* lead. 




 Goud points you making!!?!/11one 




 Sure - but people seem to have this idea that a movie (Mad Max, Terminator) can't possibly be as good if it's rated PG-13 




 And the car... 




 ToddH 




 Black and white???? Srsly? They had color why didn't use it!?? My film studies teecher saiys that it best movie all time, idk what talking Bout.

Prove my right??!?? 




 Nah... 




 The Empire Strikes Back 




 Yeah, I've never understood this - if the movie doesn't have R-rated content, then what's the point in rating it R? The movie is made before the rating is given, so it's not like it would drastically change any of the material. 




 Pigs in a blanket? 




 MEIN FURHER! I CAN WALK! 




 This isn't a poster, it's promotional material - we know for a fact Finn is a main character  




 No, that was from official leaked merchandise around the time of the second trailer. This picture is also from the official Russian Star Wars website. 




 Watch some of the behind the scenes videos of the prequels. True effort is put into making them good movies. All of the cast and crew (minus Rick McCallum and George Lucas) are really trying their hardest to bring back the magic of Star Wars. Seriously, most of the CGI holds up well today, some genuinely good performances are given by McGregor and McDarmid, and there really are a lot of good scenes to be found. That's enough redemption for me. 




 When people compare a movie to other films or its sequels.

Like saying, "The Godfather 3 sucks because it's not as good as the first 2." Who cares? Can't you just judge a movie as its own work?  




 Yeah, that post also linked to the Fox Home Entertainment page... What were they expecting? 




 ... Which is exactly how Obi Wan acted in the OT...

Also, stop pretending that the prequels are the worst thing ever. They have their flaws, but they are, by no means, horrible movies. They have redeeming qualities, and you need to look for those. 




 I can see where you're coming from, definitely - I personally hate the dark and gritty Nolan Batman, and I prefer the campy and fun Batman.  




 People have not been understanding what minimalism is lately... 




 Charlie Chaplin and morbid are not two words I would ever associate 




 Well, it has very little/ a very straightforward plot. Not much there to interpret. 




 Exclusively Hulu 




 Me too - I can't wait! 




 He's entitled to his opinions. 




 In this day and age? All of them. 




 Right, but Marvel and Pirates are not Star Wars - I think Disney would rather put out an official trailer than have tons of low-quality recordings leak. 




 Yeah, but it's like posting a recipe for brownies on a subreddit about corruption in the sugar industry. Sure, they're sorta related, but it doesn't really have to do with the overall topic. 




 No, I'd say in September, when they release all the toys and books and everything. I would also imagine that they'd release a comic con trailer to the public. 




 Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Bridge on the River Kwai 




 I'd say at San Diego Comic Con, on July 10th

http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-more-coming-to-san-diego-comic-con-2015 




 Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories. 

Here's my list:

1. The Godfather
2. Citizen Kane
3. 2001: A Space Odyssey 
4. Vertigo
5. Lawrence of Arabia
6. Doctor Strangelove
7. Gone With the Wind 
8. Back to the Future
9. The Empire Strikes Back 
10. The Wizard of Oz  




 Batman and *freaking* Robin?? Whoa, dude. 




 Nothing changed - If the majority of professional movie critics don't like a movie, it's probably safe to make the assumption that most people think that movie is not good. Just because you have a different opinion, it doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong or invalid. 




 What about a few reviews of actual critics? If  they all say a movie is good/bad, I think it's generally safe to assume that that is true. 




 Those are bad things...? 




 So you wouldn't call The Godfather or 2001 classics? 




 Why not? 




 True, but who does it better? 




 Don't just assume that mobile = bad. 




 Well, other than the characters, the setting, the general story, the ideas and messages, etc. 




 KAAAANNNNNEEEE!!!!! 




 Not trying to tell you that you should like it, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but that's sorta the point -

It's basically a piece of cinematic "art." I know it sounds pretentious or whatever, but you're supposed to interpret it how *you* want to interpret it. There's not gonna be an explanation, because it's up to you to explain it to yourself, if that makes sense. 




 I remember this being put as one of the possible formats for teaser 2... 




 And 3 feature films... 




 Seriously?

Both of those exist as movies. 




 Rendezvous with Rama 




 Why isn't he allowed to have his own preferences? Why does that make him ignorant for not being interested in something? 




 Source? 




 Wait it wasn't?
