 Hex = easy mode imo.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, but with the two base dark orb spells alone that you can buy fairly early in the game, you have a lot of casts with them, and most bosses and enemies die in a few dark orbs, and you can breeze through most of the game.  If you use dark enchant on your weapon (my SOFS hexer uses the +10 magic mace), you can do insane damage on your one hand or two hand swings.  To compliment the build, it is easy to get some of the better caster gear pretty early too (hexer set, black set, lion mage set, etc), and most importantly is the sunset staff that comes with the hexer set.  Kill some basilisks or other mobs to get a darknight stone to enchant the sunset staff with dark, and you can have the best hexer staff in the game before you're even halfway through it.


I haven't played with a pure paladin/faith type build since early vanilla days, so I can't speak too much to that, but hexer is pretty boss, though it can be too easy/boring with pure casting.  But like I said, enchant dark weapon is killer, and you could always up your combat stats and focus on melee :D 




 Dude, as much as a PITA Iron Keep was, I had a far worse time in the cramped quarters of Earthen Peak being bled out the ass by a half dozen poison manniken fuck-less faces in those narrow hallways.  That shit was maddening:  FROM 1 / Fun 0  :D 




 I wish I could take my Scythe and Axe and BoM and etc into DaS2 :( 




 Thanks Captain Correct Acronym?  The world needs a hero like you? 




 Dude, SOTS has been fantastic.  I just started playing DaS2 SOFS a few days ago, as well as vanilla DaS2 with my RL brother, and it has been very enjoyable, though a bit clunky at first when you're used to how fast, responsive, and awesome combat in BB is.  That being said, as much as I love BB, there is a reason I sort of got bored with it in two months, and am back to playing Dark Souls 2... 




 Yeah... as much as I love BB for mostly the PvE (as the PvP is very limited), there is a reason I found myself playing SOFS after merely two months of Bloodborne... 


There really is an incredible amount of options and choices for builds, challenge runs, weaponry, fashion, general PvE well into NG+ cycles, and all that good shit in DaS2... 




 I remember doing this back when the DLC first dropped on my main, an I swear, the more you get, the less they drop.  I received my first 20 within the first few hours, but then the next 30 took two days.... 




 Never mind all the whiners, even though some of their complaints were valid.  DaS2 was still the best game of 2014, and there is a reason that even all the people who supposedly hated or disliked it still clocked hundreds of hours on it.


The best way to put it is, DaS2 is the best RPG game in the souls series, but it is the lesser of the Souls games in the Souls series.  Even then, it's not all bad, and SOFS (and the DLC for sure) helped close some of those gaps I think.  Anyway, have fun.  It's the next best game to play if you've already played the previous titles and/oror Bloodborne.  Besides, as far as the awesomeness that comes out of FROM software studios, what else can fill that gap?  :D 




 Ha!  I was playing late last night, well past my expiration date, and I swear I wanted to strangle that bitch.  Fuck her and her Majestic Magical Twinkle Sword of Infinite tracking.  Seriously.  Fuck her.  Can't wait to get home and slice of her cheesy-ass twinkle tits with your strat! 




 Enjoy your bloodborne player!  Hopefully PS4 has some more exclusives to make it even more worthwhile :D   




 Be ready to roll... imposing your ethics/honor/etc on others will only bring dissapointment, just like in real life.  Or, it might even get you killed, just like last night -_- 




 Heide Knight Iron Mask!  The missing helm to many sets, especially Alva's :D 




 For sure.  But even in vanilla DaS2, I was already getting more comfortable with two handing weapons, or dual wielding or other items, and in playing a one-bro run, I learned to be comfortable with one or two handing weapons with no shields at all, since 99% of the shields suck for a onebro, or have to be two-handed and even then they are limited and situational. 




 I have definitely been throughly enjoying it, but do you remember how much people complained about the number of enemies in most locations?  Yeah, and then they upped it for SOFS... can you imagine all that bitching, times 10?  Well, they did that anyhow, so fuck it, I think you're right.


I've never been that big of a fan of using shields, and after playing Bloodborne, I never will again, especially cuz I've been thoroughly enjoying the darker, more atmospheric places, especially with a torch.  It's been a blast for sure! 




 Really?  Just by lightning them?  I will have to check this out! 




 Dude, Earthen Peak was already bad enough with all those ass-hatless poison-douche, bleedy AIDS dick headless manniken fuckers already turning my feeble mage into a pillar of salt, and due to posts like this, I haven't even gone to Iron Keep yet...  I'm, uh, saving that place for last, after all the other three mighty dick souls 

 




 When I was a kid, like a lot of little boys, I enjoyed jumping on things.  Sometimes for fun, sometimes to assert dominance, and sometimes to break shit.  This one time, I literally broke shit, by jumping on this old plywood board out back of one of my father's friends who we were visiting out of state.  The board promptly broke, and I fell into a septic tank.  I was able to catch onto the side, and yell for help as my boots dangled in the shit, and luckily my dad came out in time to find and save me.  


TL;DR - As a kid I almost died by drowning in a septic tank.  Can't think of a shittier way to go, literally, no pun intended  :D


Edit:  Shit.  In game?  Some pretty stupid stuff, though none as supid as nearly drowning in shit :D 




 Earthen Peak totally sucks, but other than that, I am enjoying SOFS waaaaay more than I thought I would.  Well worth the 20 bucks!.  Have fun man! 




 Goddammit. Really?  I just got done having my ass thoroughly raped in Earthen Peak with those godforsaken shit head clawed manikens, and now I gotta do it all over again in iron keep?  Shit... 




 Eh, I've heard that, but when I watched the videos on the posts here about that, I just didn't and still don't see any actual change in the hand.  




 I'll say DaS2 is the better RPG game, while DaS is the better FROM/Souls game :) 




 Wow.  Thanks for the story - I didn't know that one.  I mean, so the cash shops go with F2Play games, but Vindictus' RNjesus bull-shit on top of how grifty and pay2win their cash shop is, really is the nail in the coffin to that game...  insane grinds+cash shop are no substitute for actual content and a healthy comunity, which is why end game winds up sucking so much :/ 




 All indications imply he is one of the great ones, along with Ebriatis, the mind of mensis, the Moon Presence, etc. I don't know if the lesser amygdalas are great ones, or servants or what not, but they each seem to have their own agenda. I think rom and the celestials are kin though.  




 We get kin blood from rom. There is no mention of rom or the celestials being a great one. And the fact that he is called emissary makes me think he is a middle-man; perhaps they are the new servants to the great ones post pthumerian style? 




 Ebriatis is the only great one we actually encounter in the 'physical' or 'waking' world. The rest of the lore indicates that she was left behind/abandoned when the great ones ascended, leaving the physical realm, or this facet of reality. All the other great ones we encounter are either in nightmares or some sort of dream. The inferences we are given I'd that ascension (the great ones) physical bodies are long gone (aka dead) and what they share in common wih the hunters (or dead Micolash) is that they retain their consciousness through 'force of will,' which is essentially life after death, an odd sort of immortality. 


What I'm getting at, is your inferences of the cultists tryin to bring back (or summon) a great one seem pretty spot on. It just looks like summoning them through whatever ritual they were working only brings back a horrific abortion of a great one, some twisted monster, rather than the cruel powerful being itself, though I suppose tht could have been "Squirt, son of the butcher's toilet," one of the less heard of and least popular great ones :D 




 To never work when you intend it to, and to do random gestures at the worst possible times :D 




 It's not so much that the walkthrough is cheating, it's that it is robbing you of a beautiful, once in a generation type gaming experience, as much of the excitement, fear, danger, etc. comes from the atmosphere, the unknown, and the mystery of the game-play itself, let alone the fragmented story that uses the medium of gaming in a way most games haven't even dreamed of.  FROM games are unique in this regard, and you only get one blind playthrough...

Edit:  Also, Pistol  blunderbuss in every way, besides the spread that accomodates sloppier, frantic play 




 To access any and all variants of all root dungeons (so long as you have the correct base chalices), all you need to do is create a fetid/rotten/cursed Pthumeru Ihyll Root chalice dungeon, and bam:  you can create every glyph out there.  Good hunting to you o/


Edit:  The point is, don't waste your time and materials creating lesser, specific variants (ie, a cursed isz, then a fetid/rotten loran, then a cursed ihyll).  Just make the aforementioned F/R/C Ihyll and you have access to them all. 




 Think of frenzy as a massive 70% bleed, whereas rapid poison is a tiny flat 250 damage IIRC from the guide. 




 Yes!!!!!1!  THIS!  




 Or at least assist a boss, like being summoned by the mirror knight in DaS2 :D 




 Yeah.  That sounds pretty solid.  I beat him on at least two characters on long, drawn out 20 minute fights, playing it super safe by baiting out his charge/leap/vomit attacks, but on the last few characters I got sick of it, and found facing him more aggressively (closer to your strategy) to be much more to my liking  :D 




 I always put it straightforward like this:  Dark Souls 2 is the best *RPG* game of the souls series, but it is the worst *SOULS* games of the souls series  :D


I mean, there is a reason all those people who hate DaS2 so vocally still played it ravenously for hundreds and thousands of hours :D 




 *ooooh, I am here!* only happened in the DLC unfortunately, but my gawd, that was some great DLC! 




 Don't listen to the DaS2 hate-hype, especially out of context.  Fans still played it as much and even longer than previous souls games, and it was still the best game of 2014.  


What you need to understand is where the negativity comes from:  the fact of the matter is that Dark Souls 2 is the best RPG game of the souls series, *but it is the worst SOULS game of the souls series.*  What essentially made the Souls games great (aside being weighty RPGs with high risk and reward) is sloppy, stitched on, or altogether missing at parts in DaS2.  The DLC helped make up for some lost ground there, but the fact remains that while DaS2 it is the most polished, responsive, and mechanically solid of the souls games, it is lacking in everything else wonderful that makes a Souls game :) 




 If anything, the edge comes from the fact that a BT build has a huge boost when it comes to firearms, I mean, the Evelynn.  Even without bone marrow ash, it can shave off respectable chunks of HP.  The 2h attacks of the chikage are easy enough to avoid, but either weapon is a joke once you slap in 3 +27% gems in them.  GG to whoever you fight. 




 No it's my cake-day.  You summon me! 




 Don't worry on the chalice thing - they use their own difficulty ratings, and are not buffed by the NG+ cycles.

Also, don't worry about the NG cycles affectign multiplayers.  Multiplayer seems to only be based on Blood Level, so you can connect to anyone within your range, regardless of what game cycle they are in. 




 What - you don't want to die in one and a half hits to a ludwig's holy blade with three 27% gems in it?  :P 




 Not to mention, DaS2 not only great DLC, but the content of the DLC itself, and the way in which they paced the DLC release of each of the trilogy really kept the community alive and thriving with all the crazy and interesting items and weapons, even months after its release, and in between the DLC, the multiplayer community was already thriving and plenty...


The point is, I don't see any DLC for Bloodborne being anywhere near as impactful or relevant as the equivelant DLC in DaS2.  I'm sure BB DLC will be fantastic, and I'm sure FROM will hit their stride as they almost always do, and I am sure it will be enjoyable, and I'm sure it will inject some vigor into the game and multiplayer itself, but even then, it's really hard to imagine any DLC for BB that could remedy the existent problems, as some of the problems are the very nature of the game itself.  


If I could list and remedy the few main issues, it is this:

1.  I wish they had kept the frequent/unlimited invasions of B-Team's  DaS2.  It really kept the game alive and moving, well into NG cycles and all the various PvP Options.


2.  Covenants that had slightly deeper mechanics, purpose, or usefulness.  As it stands, these are shells of possibilities.  


3.  Compared to the ease and quick nature of DaS2 (or even DaS) multiplayer, BB really was a step backwards, not just in how clunky and often non-functional or slow it is, but also in it's purpose.  We need an arena, or at least better covenant and more summon sign options for duels and fight clubs.  As it stands, while relevant in theme, the bell system fucking sucks.  


4.  Variety in items and builds.  Again, I get it that they had to focus on quality over quantity, but I think everyone was spoiled in both fashion and funcionality with the unnecessary amount of gear in DaS2.  It's like night and day.  In one game we have too much redundant yet similar gear, and in BB we have sparse yet awesome and unique gear (which I almost prefer), but the lack of build diversity is what really does it for me.


Anyway, I think this is pretty much the game we get.  We'll have to wait and see what future installments bring :D 




 Do me a favor - if you're doing steady farming, can you give me a rough estimate of dropped chunks within your time frame?  Like I said, 8 in 45-60 minutes seemed like a common concensus for a few of us here. 




 You try the eye runes?  It's been awhile since I farmed the werewolves, but last I checked (and confirmed with fellow redditors), we all had consistent results, that with low arcane stats (ranging from 5-25) and the two base eye runes, I think we could get maybe, 8 chunks within a 45 minute or hour span of time?  (worth noting, I only ever bothered killing the 4 wolves in the chapel area itself, not the 5th up in the hallway.  Figured it was quicker to just run back).  It was something that wasn't too terrible, albeit still obnoxious.  Good luck :D 




 A big element of FROM games that I feel like all FROM fans learned to deal with, is *"NO PLACE IS SAFE."*  FROM consistently pushed us out of our comfort zones, first with the gameplay itself:  no saving or loading, death meaning something via loss of progress and currency, and the PvP threat constantly hedging and blurring into the PvE threat.  


And like me (and most other FROM fans) you likely at first hated how brutal the invasions or constant uncomfortability was, but that very real fear and threat added so many juicy and delicious layers in the game.  We weren't just being challenged by the game's environment and the traps the devs laid out for us, we were being haunted by other players, and our own psyches through the immersive fear and paranoia that demanded our attention to details and the enemies and the game itself.  By constantly being pushed out of our comfort zones, by dealing with our fears, and by brutal game play, every inch of progress we made gave us satisfaction, even if it was slow and frustrating at times, and what brought real life to the game more than anything else was the base underlying premise that *"NOWHERE IS SAFE."*   This is a large part of what really made the gaming experience above and beyond most everything that was available at the time, and is still available at present.  Even if you hate hate HATE(ED) PvP in present or past FROM games, there is no denying that it added so much excitement and dread to the games...


To put it simply, Bloodborne largely removed that... 




 Right, but if 'not a souls clone' means having all the successful formulas and tropes of a FROM game, minus the longevity and variety of more content/items/weapons/builds/covenants/multi-player ease and options, than that kind of sucks :/ 




 I hear ya dude, and both you and kirkhammertime who replied have your points.  For all of DaS2's faults, it really did have a fantastic amount of challenge options, challenge runs, fashion and weapon options, and thus much diversity and fun to be had in PvP, and having worthwhile, slightly meatier covenants really extended a lot of people's play-times as well (just like in DaS).  The real problem with ravenous fans like us, is that FROM created us, and no other gaming studio out there is currently coming close to making games as mysterious, immersive, challenging, and all around enjoyable in what is simultaneously a single player yet very multi-player experience... 




 Yeah.  What's worse is, with BB being so easy to digest and be satisfied yet bored with, is that there are few worthy alternatives outside of challenging, niche indie games.  With all the redundant, safe, forumalic games out there, the only thing left for me to do at the moment is buy DaS2 SoTFF... 




 It's super quick to unlock the short cut in upper cathedral ward and run up into the chapel and kill the 4 to 5 werewolves there, then bold hunter's mark right back.  I think you can kill them quicker than you can run through cainhurst, hunting down 4 or 5 gargoyles there, and on top of that, they have a higher drop rate... 




 Yeah.  I absolutely love the charred set and use it on a few of my toons, and I was always dissapointed that the claw was on the left - like - why wouldn't you use that bad mother-sucker for viscerals? 




 Have you tried summoning people in the half HP dungeons?  I tend to find a lot of summons in cursed chalices to mostly be a liability, as you are doubling the bosses HP, yet said boss can still one-shot either of you, and depending on lag, it might not even be because the other player sucks.  As a result, I never bother summoning people for these fights.  


Strategy:  I used to fight this boss on half HP mode super slowly, baiting out his charge, his jump, or his vomit, but after killing him on a few characters, I got sick of taking 15-20 minutes for the perfect fight, and I started fighting him more aggressively, and ending the fight within 5-10 minutes, but it also depends on your build and weapons and etc.  Ludwig's and BT (chikage+eve) builds can burn this guy pretty quick, and if you have decent BT, you can hang back once you lower his HP enough and just shoot him to death. 




 This.  This right here. 




 Dark Souls is the better Souls game (better story, suspense, level/boss/game design), but Dark Souls 2 is the better RPG game (smoother, improved combat, floatier yet responsive and weighty). 


Having played BB first, DaS2 will feel like a step backwards in pace and speed, an it will feel even slower if you play DaS last. For both mechanics and stories, I'd suggest you play them in order, blind, with no google or spoilers or easy help or maps :D


Also with noting, don't pay heed to any of the people who decry and bitch about DaS2. It was still the best game of 2014, and all is fans still played it more than anything else - we were just disappointed in some of B-team's decisions and methodology, and while it was the best RPG of the series, it was at the bottom of the list for what made souls games perfect games.  




 If only destiny had a story period, or characters... God that game is a piece of shit.  




 I'm pretty sure invasions have always worked on a larger upwards scale for all or most of the FROM games? 




 Thank you, and yes, I just re-read your original post and I feel appropriately like a dummy  :)


That being said, thanks for answering me anyway, and great work on the spread-sheet.  Much appreciated!


Edit:  Do you think it would be worth adding a few notes on the easiest way to farm some of the chalice materials people sometimes sometimes find themselves lacking?  Ie.:


Tomb Mold 5 = kill the rats at the beginning of great isz chalice

sage's hair - farm the undead-sage guy right next to the lamp in layer 3 of lower loran

ritual blood 5 - farm the chest in lower ailing loran which is just a quick run from one of the first lamps 




 And is it true, that if you create a cursed/fetid/rotten pthumeru ihyll chalice, you can then create any and all variants of ihyll, isz, and loran?  There was a PSA not too long ago stating that, and I have yet to test it on my current toon.  Thanks!


Edit:  just re-read your post, and answered my own question.  thank you! 




 Don't forget, it also exists because of a lack of competition.  Most of the competition copied wow in mechanics, style, formula, give or take a few minor tweeks or dynamics, so there isn't much of an alternative.  Everyone just wanted to make the fabled 'wow-killer,' and in their rush to copy the ultimate success formula, they stifled creativity and set innovation back a decade... 




 Dude.  Tourists aside, that is still a lot of money.  They aren't going to be investing any less in WoW for the forseeable future... 




 It's not a matter of making an MMO for everyone, it's about making a solid game period, and whether that is for a large or niche audience depends on a lot of factors.  But at present, and for a long time now, there are bigger problems in the gaming world.


The problem is the gaming industry at large, who have been mostly playing it safe on boring, formulaic game-play models (which you can't blame to a degree), but the lack of forward thinking, creativity, and innovation has caused much of the genre to grow stagnant and dull.  People just don't get the same kind of thrills playing the same WoW or WoW-esque games decade after decade, and until a developer comes along to shake things up in some way, shape or form, people are willing to scratch that itch, even on boring and inferior products, settling for less while waiting for something better to come along.  The problem with the skinner-box of MMO's, is that it's often the compulsion to play drives people to keep grinding away, not actual fun or solid game-play. 


The large fact of the matter at hand is, the redundant WoW formula of addiction based game-play/the skinner box needs to go the way of the fuckin dinasaurs already.  A lot of people are bored with the staleness of the gameplay, the tread-mill, riding the same rides on the theme park over and over again, and very little has changed, aside this kick-starter gaming era, which is the only real hope it seems for innovation and change at this point in time, as the larger companies are there to make money first, and make a good game second, and they will not stray from their formulas...
 




 Oh yes, I was thinking of the choice to ignite the flame or become dark lord, not killing Gwynn himself.  My bad :D


Edit:  Point remains, slightly swapped around though, and equally convoluted. 




 Great point.  The economy of lag-stabs in DaS1 was some real shit, and it wasn't much better in DaS2.  Love the way they changed up viscerals in bloodborne :D 




 With how much people either spam their own quick R1's, or how quick they can load up bone marrow and take off a large chunk of your health with a bullet, the game itself pretty much renders all other attacks obsolete (to a point), aside a few precision and specific moments...  The point is, while you're trying to diversify your swings and make PvP 'interesting,' they've already nailed you with 2 R1's and taken off two thirds of your health.  Kind of annoying at how simple the combat system makes itself for PvP.


Personally, I like to throw a few R1's here or there to get things moving, then pull out the heavier and harder hitting moves once they have fapped off their R1's, and once they are expecting nothing but R1s 




 Eh, even in DaS and DaS2, the lagstabs plagued it just as badly, if not worse, so it's not too much different here, other than the 30% health penalty making it an easy 1HKO, or runes making it a 1HKO, but I've noticed a lot of people can't land parries, and if they do, they often have a hard time pulling it off in time.  Point is, I feel like it's comparable to how cheesy/annoying it could be in past games, but so it goes, par for the course. 




 Not really.  The chosen undead didn't have to face Gwyn, nor did the game really inevitably tell you that you had to, and even if you did, you still didn't understand the ins and outs and repercussions of all that.  It's pretty similar in this game... 




 Hint:  you don't have to kill him, now or later for that matter.  You can keep progressing and exploring in Old Yharnam while ignoring him  :D 




 Whatever you do, even if it takes you a month to understand and get the hang of, is, DON'T LOOK UP ANY SPOILERS OR EASY HELP OR ETC.


FROM Software makes beautiful games, and you only get one chance at a clean, mysterious, unknown playthrough of the game, where you get to discover items, bosses, and story-elements of your own.  Drink it in and enjoy it, as for me (and thousands of others), FROM games have been a challenging and invigorating innovation in what has been a fairly stagnant, and unchallenging gaming industry.  Enjoy! 




 What happened?  Did it eventually boot you out? 




 Hate gender locked classes :/

Would have loved to play a reaper, but staring at a yappy little Elinn's underwear all day is just not remotely appealing :( 




 Vella is such an awesome class, and she wound up being my favorite class to play, because she was so fun, but I hate the fact that I have to be fuckin transgender 

Lynn was fuckin bad-ass too, but the most obnoxious thing is that she literally skips around town like a retarded school girl.  Fucking dissapointing for such a wushu kung-fu touch of death bad-ass! 




 The game is fun in the beginning, a bit bland and repetitive in the middle, and fun again towards late-mid to end-game, but past 60 (more like 70), it is hard to stay competitive without cash shopping it, and last I checked, the economy had massively tanked, and if you don't have the cash to buy good end game gear, it is a long drawn out grind.  I made a good chunk of money over a period of a few years, so I was able to equip my toons well once they hit levels 60 to 70, but I can only imagine it would be frustrating as hell at present with how shitty the cash shop it is, and how ludicrous the best crafting materials cost... 




 Another comment:  have you played Tera since the last expansion from fall or christmas or whenever it was?  If so, how is it?  What are/were the major changes?  I plan on looking up more info on it here on this and the Tera subreddit, but if you or anyone else could provide some info firsthand, I'd appreciate that as well.  Thank you! 




 I loved vindictus, made a fortune on magic powders back in early 2010-teens (before economy was tanked), had great fun playin the game and leveling a bunch of toons over the years from 60-70 and then buying them the lower top tier gear, but past that, the atrocious grind that is tied into their bull-shit cash shop system absolutely ruined the game for me. The end game of pay-2-compete and not get kicked from the boat is one of the worst designs in gaming history. I'm sad as well that Nexon is such a shit company. That being said, can you explain how said one player controlled and tanked the economy? 




 Feminists are not NT, especially if you are a male. As for the rest, I mean it sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder, and I'm not talking about your rape comment... 




 Ok. Clearly you're either some insane feminist or brain-washed male apologist. Either way, you have great propensity for great bull-shit, and I'm going back to the bliss of pretending like you don't exist.  




 Honestly, I don't, and I never really did. I've even fairly good at quitting games once the compulsion to play outweighs the fun. If anything, I find leveling up characters, creating builds, and basic game progression more fun than repeating and grinding out end-game encounters, raids, or other redundant farming. I play a game, so long as I am having fun with it. Once it becomes stale or boring or a seemingly endless treadmill, I take a break or quit, as I don't have the patience or time for grinding and farming these days.

 Read my other reply.  




 Because she has to treat it nicely, as it has become sentient and domineering. But I'd be remiss if I didn't add that it totally gave me a chubby! 




 Just say no to life!  Though I suppose I would be super crazy-protective of my hands if they could net me thousands of dollars an hour for work that was something other than prostitution.  




 You make a good point, please forgive or at least excuse my more asshole-ish remarks, at least for the moment.  My apologies, as just like in person, I often come off as gruff, or sharp, and I generally try to make myself as approchable and logical and reasonable as possible.  Perhaps I have been a bit rash here, but so it goes with anything that excites me, but just as they are voicing their opinions, I am voicing mine, and none of it changes the fact that I find much of the bitching and moaning here on this post (go figure, the internet in general) to be pathetic and sad, and it often smacks of deeper seated insecurities and unresolved personal problems.  But so it goes with opinions and bias.


For myself, I can't help but feel that this whole thing is in afront to both the good and bad nature in man, and that catty bull-shit spoken behind someone's back makes us worse for our wear.  I think I am falsely perceiving it as the further emasculation of men, ie., just another attack on men, and as you said, it comes down to just more opinions:  ie., some men will say, *I can feel my feelings and that's fine,* and so it is, but if that is the case, then there is no need for said male to rag on a man who he perceives as a steroype or old-fashioned, ie., a big strong man who loves sports and seems simpler when it comes to his feelings and approaches to life.  At that point, it is like the pot calling the kettle black.


Part of why I appreciate the men in my life, is that they are diverse, strong men from various backgrounds, and most of them aren't afraid to confront me or each other if they have a problem that needs fixing, or something that needs to be resolved, and they aren't afraid to deal with their feelings, and I am talking former jail-birds, welders, mechanics (myself, a fighter/martial artist), and seeing this post, reminds me of what I hate in people period - pointless whining, the inability or fear to address one's own problems, disorganzied back-stabbing, and so forth.  I know it's no organized effort to try to drag men down, as clearly many of these people on this very forum (and outside by the sounds of their bitching) need no help in painting themselves in a poor light, but still, I find it offensive, but that is clearly my own problem, no?  I think the root of the problem is, I want men to be better than they are, and shit like this reminds me that, they, and me, and we, are often not.  We are fucking animals, and we often forget that, for all our intelligence, creativity, and virtues...


Edit:  Now I'm sad :( 




 And a lot of reports are bull-shit.  It sure is fuck aint 1 in 4 women have been raped... 




 You're so enlightened and smurt.  when I growed up, I want to be like you c: 




 And apparently the joke is on you, as there seems to be no pleasing you.  I like it that, even if I write something like, *"real men learn to deal with their feelings,"* you still choose to take offence to it, even though that is exactly what you were talking about, as if learning to feel and cope with your emotions somehow makes you less of a man.  Over-sensitive much?  It's ok, I'm sensative too, and I can admit it, and I am also a practitioner of martial arts, and can fight with the best of them, and I have and will continue to kick some ass.  Point is, I can do perceived manly shit, and I can also deal with my feelings and admit to my faults, and address my feelings as they come up.  I'm also letting you know that just because there is that old joke/stigma/judgment scale, doesn't mean that all modern men adhere to it, or are too afraid to talk about it.  I know many awesome men who are as manly as they come.  Welders, mechanics, prison-birds, all manners of men from all walks of life who aren't afraid to admit when they are in pain, when they have a problem, and when they need help.  I'd suggest you find some people you can connect with, and maybe they can help you come to terms with your own issues. 




 Eh, it's alright.  Did I get the job? 




 You write it like it is something every other man does, or something men do casually, when the reality is, it is a very small percentage of men who actually perpetrate that crime.  The last few studies I read put it something at like, 4 or 5% of men are actually that violent/controlling/fucked in the head.  That whole 25% of women (1 in 4) have been raped is a bull-shit statistic, completed at a bull-shit college in a bull-shit study.  Regret, shame, guilt, and anger for your actions and choices does not constitute rape.  That being said, while it is a small amount of women who falsely acuse men of abuse and rape, if women could stop doing that, that would be great. 




 Right, and so long as it's somewhat fun, what else are you going to do anyhow? 




 Don't feed the troll. 




 bahahahaha.  I enjoyed this post.  Thank you :) 




 Everyone has them.  The difference is, I've worked my ass off to deal with mine, and hopping on someone's asinine reddit post to vent your issues, while popular, really doesn't do anything to benefit anyone, namely the original whiny poster.  And why am I doing this?  Because I choose to, because it is amusing, and because maybe one of these whiners will pull the plug and let out enough of their own insecure, dellusional bull-shit to think, "jeeze, maybe other men are not the problem." 




 Chodehats are stylish as fuck though! 




 Real men learn to deal with their feelings, whatever that entails for the individual - and don't fool yourself.  Men talk about it all the time.


That being said, coming on here to vent insecurities and jealousies is kind of pathetic dude, and frankly, I find this post and most of the people in it really fucking sad. 




 I know right?  You might not like them all, understand them all, or want to be friends with them all, as you can have vastly different interests, approaches, and philosophies on life, but it's not like we need to make a pathetic thread about this to stab our fellow men in the back like a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order, right?


This shit is pathetic. 




 Being fake or posturing or lieing isn't unique to men or rednecks.  In fact, women lie every day about how tall they are, what their face looks like, their hair, etc...


Also, the real country people I know have earned my respect above anyone else, as they are very knowledgeable about survival, construction, creativity, and all manners of useful things.  And while they may not be the most cultured people, they are a lot more useful than the vast suburbs full of clueless, middle to upper class children who know little to nothing about life, or providing for themselves and their family. 




 Dude, no shit huh?  I've made several posts on here to combat the influx of bitching and whining by what sounds like a bunch of immature high-school children having identity crises, coming on here, venting their own insecurities and emotional issues, but still, the ceaseless discharge of bull-shit is still flowing!  Frankly, it's pathetic. 




 Women rape men too.  And the amount of men who rape women is a very teeny-tiny percent of men overall.... 




 Thank you, 'IEatAnyAss.'  I'm sure your suggestions have been well received. 




 You make it sound like immaturity is unique to men and men alone... 




 I've made several replies along these lines to combat the influx of whiny children and pandering little bitches who come in here to vent their insecurities, and holy hell, you can't imagine the amount of butt-hurt and inferiority complexes! I get it though. I can tell a lot of them are young men and women with little sense of self-identity and few honest personal beliefs, young liberals who are hopping on the band-wagon of 'combatting the stereotypes of being a man,' thinking their is some pay-off or benefit to anyone for it, but little do they know, they give themselves away as jealous, insecure, spiteful children. They are airing their issues on here, simply because they don't know any better.


These kids need to work through their emotional issues and neuroses, as there is nothing more pathetic and obnoxious than an adult child...

 Way to kill the joke.... and it still holds true in some cases... a perfect excuse for stupid people :D 




 I made a simple comment that this whiny, passive-aggressive, cheap-shot bull-shit makes the 'men' and 'women' of this thread look like a bunch of angsty, insecure, high-school children, that's all.


Take it or leave it, be a passive-aggressive bitch about it, whine about it, do what you will, but I stand by what I said.  This post, like much of reddit/the internet, is a cancerous circle-jerk for weak-minded people.  And if you simper enough, maybe it will get you some attention, and maybe it'll even get you laid! 




 And oh how they defend their pathetic whining and passive-aggressive bull-shit! 




 I hate the men in this thread:  you are making men sound like pathetic, catty high-school children. 




 Yeah!  How dare they be men! 




 LOL 




 I don't hate anything in particular about men, but I do hate people that feel the need to give credence to this post in a pathetic, passive-aggressive, dear-diary entry because they are too chicken-shit to deal with their own emotional problems and inferiority complexes.


It's not any man's fault per se that you feel the way you do, but please, learn how to deal with your own feelings, and take responsibility for your own goddamn life.  Most of this just sounds like childish bitching, and hens scratching each other's face off for a higher rank in the pecking order.  It's goddamn disgusting.
