 It's to prevent reproduction.

EDIT: Until they change their sexual gender. 




 Go to a doctor and get scheduled for a circumcision, immediately. I had pinhole phimosis when I was 11 and I know exactly what you're going through. That ballooning of the foreskin and the pain you get when urinating because the urine flows back in since it can't all escape due to the small opening. That can cause bladder infection over time if not treated.

I had pinhole phimosis for two years and it was hell. The firs time I urinated after I got my circumcision was the best feeling in the world, I was so surprised and happy. Urine flowed out so fast and easy like it normally should as opposed to how it goes out slow and restricted with pinhole phimosis.

No, there is no other treatment for pinhole phimosis that does not result in removal or partial removal of the foreskin. You can ask but your doctor will tell you the same thing. Even minor surgery to open up the opening of the foreskin wider could end up resulting in you developing pinhole phimosis once again so circumcision is the absolute solution for your problem, for our problem.

I know life is hard but you have so much to look up to. Please stay optimistic, I know it's difficult but please, take care of yourself.

Go to a doctor and get checked up for your pinhole phimosis as soon as possible.

Best of luck. 




 TIL: Plants can have scar tissue. 




 Have you ever heard of Apophenia? 




 I could've done that myself. 




 What is a pyramid scheme? 




 OH SHIT THAT WAS GWEN STACY 




 RIP Drift King, DK 




 Rise of the Planet of the Dinosaurs.

Dawn of the Planet of the Dinosaurs. 




 is this a reference to something? 




 Wait how do you know that Blue's a girl? 




 Like when they actually stumble upon the original park's visitor section? 




 I was really hoping he was gonna get eaten. Rather him than the assistant. The assistant got fucked up. 




 Fuck, now I have to go jack off. 




 I didn't know they were putting hair on crash test dummies now. 




 What the hell? I didn't know that was a thing. 




 bro what're you talking about reddit is full of people that get pussy on a daily basis. 




 The older brother's hot girlfriend was unrealistic. Dude's a pussy and a dick for how he treats his younger brother. 




 Wait, what the hell's baby talk then? 




 BABY TALK. "aww but i wanna cuddleeeeeee" "I'm tiredddddddddddduh"

Shut the fuck up. 




 You're adorable and so is your daughter :)

Thank you for sharing this special moment with us. You have a great kid. 




 But who buys porn nowadays? 




 Yeah there was an ad before the video and stopped me from hearing that shit. 




 Did you find his comment by coincidence or are you notified each time someone mentions EAP? 




 So it IS derived from the Rasengan. 




 I got downvoted so fast :(

But yeah, I totally get what you mean! It's ironic that you say Wind-Based Version of Chidori since Lightning and Wind are polar opposites lol. I would imagine the "Rasengan-Variant of Chidori" would be similar to the Supreme Ultimate Rasengan (http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Supreme_Ultimate_Rasengan) as it's practically the Rasengan without the intense shape transformation.

Have an upvote. 




  Yo! Champ in the making! guy is Red's father.

That guy always believed in me even when no one else did. Even when I didn't believe in myself. He da real MVP 




 Damn that was so clever. I would give you gold if I wasn't broke. 




 Since Kakashi used the same principles of shape transformation and nature/elemental affinity of the Rasengan to create Chidori, which allowed him to infuse his own nature/elemental affinity to it (Raiton/Lightning Release) - which he couldn't do with the Rasengan.

It's also interesting to note that the Rasengan was created with the intention to be able to infuse all the elemental affinities together simultaneously in one jutsu yet we never saw that happen. 




 Namikaze Satellite omg so much nostalgia 




 hotels and motels can get around it

The latch?

because technically the door can only be opened with a key that only you are given during your stay

But the guys in the story had another key that unlocked her door, right? So that's not always true
 




 dude that's so shady that people would do that. don't you have to get your place checked out or follow regulations and inspections before you can become an official business and run an inn/motel/hotel etc. ?

this sounds like some bates motel shit. with the owner being a serial killer and what not. 




 This was probably the only thing that kept me going during the filler hell of Part I. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwBKzx_74I

You guys remember it? :) 

Yura Yura was good too. I like how it depicted the characters in modern clothing. 




 Because rape culture only applies to females. right? /s. 

fuck 3rd wave feminism. there is a difference between equality and superiority.

I hate how in this day and age, all a woman has to do is yell, "rape," and point the finger and she can fuck up a man's life forever. ESPECIALLY in the many cases where the case of "rape" turns out to be a lie. Some bitch lied about getting rape and nearly got a man in jail for years. 




 Republican on Reddit. Easy.

Can someone eli5 me this? 




 So basically, it's just a cheap trick to reap some internet points? 




 What do you mean? 




 7 hours later, it's #1 on the front page. 




 You'll see a post with 4000 upvotes but the author is [deleted] 




 I agree 




 Will check it out, thank you! Are you from Australia? 




 Rasenshuriken IS a Wind Jutsu. But yeah that's a fucking good question. He only has like three or four Jutsus and just creates variation on variation on variation from those three. 




 That makes a lot of sense, actually.  




 Oh, so those things already come with the hotel room? I thought I had to bring my own and assemble it or something, I'm not very familiar with that kind of stuff. 




 Do you have to bring your own? And do you have to ask for permission to assemble one? 




 Damn. So when you die you have the choice of reaching the afterlife or stay on the planet as a ghost for eternity, right? 




 If "cool" is just a synonym for "asshole," I don't think I want to be cool anymore. Also, why do girls like assholes then?

EDIT: inb4 someone confuses "douchebag/jerk guy" for an anus. 




 What the FUCK 




 That contradicts what I've heard about good ghosts that serve as "guardians." 




  Babadook

What's that?

 




 So what I got from this is that there are good ghosts and there are bad ghosts. 




 Can you explain what latching your door means and how you do it, please please?

 I'm really glad your okay OP. Whatever those two guys were up to, it wasn't good. 




 are you a guy 




 fliporama captain underpants. upvote if you remember 




 That's like going through your huge list of Facebook friends and unfriending everyone you actually don't keep in touch with/don't really know. Takes too much time.

 What's her name, anyone?? 




 Source? 




 PLEASE HAVE A FOLLOW UP TO THIS VIDEO. I wanna know what happened to that guy. 




 Thank you for the clarification, that makes much more sense. 









 Did you know there's beastiality subs too? With human women sucking dog penises. 




 Can you please tell me what /r/fatpeoplehate was actually about? Was it about HATING against Fat People or what Fat People Hate (EX: Exercise, etc.) ? 




 What the hell happened to Sakura's face. It also looks like she shrinked into a dwarf. 




 Anyone notice how the artwork completely changed?

EDIT: Art style. 




 I don't understand how people confuse a scratch for a full on punch with the fist 




 I just want to see what it looks like. The purple lightning raikiri 




 i thought that only applied to rasenshuriken 




 Konohoes, Konoha Hoes. Fucking smart. 




 WHOA. Has Kakashi Hiden been released in manga yet!? 




 In all those times he used the basic Rasengan, he could've infused his elemental nature within it. I don't believe he ever used Fuuton: Rasengan again after clashing with Kakashi's basic Rasengan.

Now I understand Fuuton: Rasenshuriken and True Wind Style: Rasenshuriken (Sage Mode w/Throw and Expand) is more powerful but still. 




 Useless, really? That's a really powerful word. 




 Why doesn't Raikiri have Chidori's distinct sound, "like birds chirping", if they are the same technique? 




 Raikiri doesn't sound like birds chirping. 




 Raikiri doesn't sound like birds chirping. 




 Raikiri doesn't sound like birds chirping. 




 What does "cutting a lightning bolt in two" actually mean? I can't picture that. 




 In the Dub, Kakashi used "Lightning Blade." 









 Holy shit. Isn't that class like... important?  




 That was just one quote not plural. 




 Damn that's scary 




 I didn't know there was such thing as an Uzumaki Clan until later in Part II. 




 He didn't hit him in the head, he literally scratched his forehead protector with his claws. (sharp nails that he gets in his initial Jinchuriki form)

 Some guy at the Vans store sprayed this stuff all over his suede shoes and poured some water from his water bottle over it and his shoes were completely fine. No water damage to the suede whatsoever and it was dry. 




 Pretty sure it has a lot to do with genetics. 




 What's it called when you are aware that you are living in a simulated universe and not "the real" universe as we are all currently doing in this thread rn? Have we become self-aware? 




 artificial selection 









 I lol'd so hard. 




 There was a post that made it to the front page about how Jackie Chan is a well-known sex-fiend in Hong Kong. 




 Not very familiar with tumblr. Could you link me please?

There's just so many direct foreshadowing in these past episodes that it just frustrates me that we got hit with a complete curveball. 




 So much development and foreshadow for NaruSaku yet NaruHina ends up on top. 




 "When you return to your village, are you going to tell that person that you love her?"

Naruto: "Aha, no I don't think I can bring myself to do that yet. For right now, I'll just keep watching over her."

"And you're satisfied with that?"

Naruto: "Of course *nothing would make me happier if she chooses me someday*... but either way - it's okay. I just want **Sakura** to be happy. That's all that matters. 




 I'm fucking stupid. Thanks for the clarification 




 Dude that's insane. But was the girl in the video really talking about swallowing cum? 




 When I was a child, I hit my head on a glass table and the side of my head split open. My family called an ambulance and an ambulance came and bandaged me up and took me to get stitches and they gave me a bear they I still hold onto today. The bear really helped me calm down when I was freaking out from all the blood pouring.

EDIT: Oh I just said that..... 




 MMA sounds like the best choice for self-defense training. 



















 Damn, Asian girls really do must have the best pussy 




 Sexy video. But those aren't big tits :( 




 WAIT, SERIOUSLY!?!?!?!?!??!?! IBUPROFEN IS $319!???

I need to save up what little supply I have left. 




 Yeah, copyright contract issues or some bullshit. 




 Thank you SOOOO much. How did you find that out??? 




 It's Korean. 




 So, basically, the subs are fake and Nana wasn't talking about sex at all? 




 Did that cop just get away with threatening a kid by saying he was going to break his neck? 




 This shit looks gay as hell, couldn't get past 3 seconds of it. Are you sure someone doesn't get fucked or whip out his dick in this gif? 




 Happy Cake Day, friend. 




 Why does this school list Jun Fan Gung Fu and Jeet Kune Do as two separate martial arts? They're both names for Bruce Lee's system. 




 While this video is a parody - it does bring up many ridiculous aspects of point sparring such as the low guard and ridiculous stance. Also "Blind attacks" are illegal? What the heck. 









 https://youtu.be/sCLv7IeWK5A?t=4023 









 FUCK wrong video. I'm so sorry. This is the video I meant to submit with the song playing at the current time. https://youtu.be/sCLv7IeWK5A?t=4023 




 He'll always be with you, in here. :) 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-SEfT21XwE

Sounds like Oregon Trail, but I'm not sure!?? 




 Thanks man!!! 




 fucking real 




 I honestly don't know and it's killing me because I hear it all the time 




 How long did it take before you started getting consistent with submitting your peers?

EDIT: At least somewhat consistent 




 Can confirm. Fuck Hollywood for stuping down to lies for cheap racist jokes. 




 I honestly don't see what's wrong with being uncomfortable around homosexuals. Some people love clowns, some people hate clowns. 




 Holy shit. 




 this 




 I don't get what's going on. Is she being serious? If so, that's crazy that she openly admitted to being kinky like that. Can someone confirm if she's reading lines or something? 




 I think it was intentional.
