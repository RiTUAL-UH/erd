 Sweet tattoo. I love when athletes get the rings tatt'd on.

I'd imagine I would do the same if I ever competed in the Olympics - which is to say, when they make Reddit an Olympic sport.  




 Eh, I don't know if it will keep me from reading his stuff, but I'm definitely prepared to brace myself for it at this point.  




 Nah, my cutoff is 2:16am. ;-)

But yes, Salem's Lot, The Kite Runner, and Johnny Got His Gun are just a few books I remember taking me well into the early morning.  




 Guess that's SI for ya... 




 AFTA is a favorite of mine too, although that whole part toward the end with him in the rowboat struck me as just another way Uncle Ernie tried to portray himself of Mr. Macho all the time. Really enjoyed the story, but sometimes his little shifts like that irritate me.  




 I read "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold" earlier this year. Really enjoyed it. Nice, quick read for a long car ride.  




 I actually bought an Amazon Fire instead of an iPad because the Black Friday sale was too good to pass up. ($70)

Also, I despise anything made by Apple.  




 I'd imagine what it really comes down to is knowing the audience inside and out. To that point, I mean making sure the content is geared toward the audience, the advertisers are geared toward the correct demographic and more importantly, the quantity of prints are just the right amount. It sounds like a formula that can maintain itself for a while. As far as making a profit, that's another story all together.  




 Same. Want a tune up against me first? We can just drink beer and go to the scorecards. It won't pay much, but I'll spring for a nice IPA. Hell, you can be the IPA Heavyweight belt holder if you want. 




 Short list but each provided a little trip down memory lane (even if they were all direct references to how good they were in NHL [insert year here]). 

Would your team have any need for these guys? Could you see them landing anywhere?

 Major props for Baldur's Gate. My friends and I still quote the wizard's use of Oppenheimer's "I am become death...destroyer of woooooorlds" quote. Which I think is a Buddhist quote, but that's neither here nor there.  




 Generational gap here, but that would be Warcraft II for me. And Age of Empires II. Both bring me back to nights where all my friends and I were concerned with was mining digital gold, harvesting digital lumber and coordinating our attacks.  




 I had four sliver queens back in the 90s. Sold them in early 2000s for $40, and now they're worth $40 each. So yeah, that too.  




 Kinda ended abruptly, but I liked it. Still don't know why he had to rip it in half though. Those winter coats have pretty big pockets.  




 To the best of my knowledge it was obsolete by 1985. ;-)

Honestly, I read it so long ago I don't feel like I could justify any comments with how well it held up. Looks like I need to give this one another go soon... 




 **Cuba Libre, by Elmore Leonard**

I read Get Shorty a few years ago and really enjoyed it. Picked this one up a few months back and finally cracked it open this past weekend. About 150 pages in and so far, so good. As usual his dialogue is the most amusing part of his stories.  




 I extended my vacation past July 4 for the sheer fact that every Tuesday my library has a book sale (in the fall they do one every other Saturday). This is the first time I've gone on a weekday. 

Here's my haul from earlier today, all for a whopping total of $5. 

Shogun - Volumes 1   2 (Really stoked about this find. All I've ever seen in the past was the tattered paperback version with size 1 font).  

A Conspiracy of Paper - David Liss  
Read the first chapter, seemed interesting enough to give it a go.

The City of Falling Angels - John Berendt  
I've heard things, so worth a shot.

The Alienist - Caleb Carr
I've seen this book at previous sales and always passed it over. Decided to drop my hard-earned 50 cents on it this time around. 

The Bonfire of the Vanities - Tom Wolfe  
I've never read anything by him, so I'm not sure what to think. Definitely purchased this one on name alone.

And of course photos, since books are pretty:

Thoughts on any of these titles?  









 I picked up The Howling from a discount book store once just to see if it held up in comparison to the movie. I actually liked the book a lot more and, frankly, didn't know it was a book before the movie. 

And if you're into horror and such, there are a few books in the Ravenloft series that touch on werewolves, although not to the same extent of a series in itself. One in particular, called Heart of Midnight, is about lyncanthrophy.  




 Start and end with college textbooks, and I'll say you're on to something.  




 The kid took a beating, too. Verdejo has a wicked hook, and if I'm not mistaken he messed up his right hand halfway through the fight. Ive seen photos of him in a sling since. He won it easily, but I think he put Najera down two or three times. 




 I agree, but emphasis on "in the range." I don't have issues with catchweights, but in more recent fights Cotto's demands on Geale left that dude totally dead on his feet at the weigh-in. I think he dropped something like 12 pounds in 10 days. Geale always looks like he's one second away from falling into a permanent zombie state, but his body language was like that of a man who was dying on the inside. 

155 for Cotto-Canelo is totally reasonable for both fighters. Should be a good one.  




 Sorry. I'm new to the Internet. Will work on my game. 




 Caddyshack a Shaq.
