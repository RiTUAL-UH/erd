 In my living room my family cannot get a good signal at all. We have a hard-wire hooked up to the PlayStation in the, but because we don't really use it. Is there some thing I could buy that would connect to the end of that then boost the signal?

Edit: I'm sorry it's such a cliche response, I just...... 




 You assumed correctly :)
btw thanks for the help!

And if I do Up grade should I move lesser-card to the other slot and plug the new one in my primary, or just sell the old?

I'm cool with not maxing out games, but if there is a better graphics card of the same price I'd love some recommendations.
 I'm also looking to do some editing with special effects (it won't be a very huge thing so  I'm not looking to tilt my purchasing towards that, though I'd like to know if this would be able to handle minor editing stuff)

I do plan to throw in a SSD and a blueray writer/reader later but for now my budget isn't too huge.

I also have a friend selling me a CPU cooler. 




 I'm^pretty^sure^it^doesn't^work^that^way^here 









 Lord of the rings: Conquest
You play as a soldier in a lord of the rings fight. Plain and simple. There is a story mode but it's most of the time you'd be using the custom battle type. It's for Xbox and PC. The multiplayer is fun to. It being an old game it has it's ups and downs, but what game doesn't?
nice and cheap too in used game sections of stores. lot's of fun. 




 haha le durp trolololllolol 




 all of it
 




 It doesn't please him; you please him, my son. All you shall do in his name is righteous.  




 ow 




 I think if he was played by an average player, no way.

You can get fucked soooo easily in that game, even if you take the situation into account. 




 Maybe a monitoring device to keep track of the vehicle perhaps? 




 *Friend comes out of the house*

Friend: need a hand?

Me: sure! Many hands makes light work.

Dad: Jaetman did you take your meds? How many times do I have to tell you hands don't make light work! electricity does! 




 But by Gabe is it ever a glorious erection! 




 Flim Flam 




 Awesome! This is like the all in one for every last one of my current questions! 




 These games look amazing and I'm tired of BS shooters like COD. So bought  Amra 2 a long time ago and never played it. 

 About 5 mins ago I traded a valuable Team Fortress 2 item for Arma 3. I don't know what to do **at all**. I wanted to ask for the advice you would have given you self when starting. (would love advice about getting into the community)


If I'm in the wrong place for posting this, please inform me. I'll delete this and move there. :) Thanks!

Edit: I tried messing around in Arma 2 with the campaign and DayZ and It was like walking through your friends house in the dark. I was to repeat my self lost. It was fun though. 




 This is great! Keep it up, dude! 




 Oh god. How did I do that? 









 Well in Dust 541 they just have tons of clones. So when you die you just get put in a new body. So unless the clone creation facility was destroyed it is basically unending. 









 anal beads 




 It would be even better if you weren't playing it on console. 




 That would be because it's bigger.......... 









 You don't play console games, you tolerate them. 









 If anyone played the old x-men GameCube game, you may remember the part where someone hurts you so much and there is a cut scene where they speak about how you need to burn a healer mutant to kill them. Also in the newest movie he has a machine put on his heart to prevent healing.

So if he is faced against someone like the human torch or maybe a army of fire benders, he could face some real challenges.

As far as the machine thing goes in a fight that would be unrealistic. I don't think you could really pin down the metal-skeleton-mutant and put that on his heart. He also took it out on his own in the movie.  




 Congrats! The cables look nice too.

thank ya' 




 Looks like the Goliath titan from Snk 




 If this is the worst time, then the rest will be easy-mode. Simple logic, O.P. 




 12! thanks man! 




 Scab bacon. That is all. 




 Not in "caffeine"! But... Yeah. I'll let myself out.......... 




 He did that because it was his fault the pelican got him. When he released it he had the intention of letting it live and because it was his fault it was dying he wanted to stop it. The pelican wasn't hurt and neither was the bird. If you're gonna get mad, get mad about something that's not bull-shit. 




 If your name was RapistBurger, wouldn't that make you a Burger that rapes stuff?

BTW, thanks! It's stuff like this that makes PC gaming so great. :)

 To start the offer, S.F. sticky for stormy billycock 




 Ahhh thank you. In the most recent movie he did have negative reactions when he was on Zod's ship.

EDIT: fixed a word 




 I'm interested I added you. I'll be on tomorrow.

 




 I have limited Superman Knowledge, but I assumed it was because he was so used to feeling super, that the normal-ness that krypton gives him; makes him feel like he's experiencing super-withdraw.

I have no idea if this is true but I feel like I remember it from somewhere. If someone knows for sure I would love the correction :) 




 Hey listen here. 




 I'm guessing that too

 I'm not against your argument...... but how are you so sure that this happened? 




 I totally second BL2. I'm posotive you'll enjoy at least some aspect of it You could love the looting system or killing hoards of enemies with ease...... OR BOTH! Such a good game if you wanna feel like an overpowered bad ass. Plus it's funny as hell. 




 Agent 47 could pull it off and leave un-scratched in my opinion. If she starts in her apartment she'd also be an easy target for a sniper. The largest obstical for assassins is her well tuned senses 




 Thanks
 




 I paid 23 keys for the steaming armored authority and I understand that was too much. Should I do this? it's worth 21 keys.

 I'm pretty sure they would be faster with running being a part of their daily lives. OP should have specified what type of cave man and he also should have asked for a brief physical description. 




 5.) come on the poor doctor
 




 he said while wearing a suit 




 My dad had something happen like this in college. Some girls went in his dorm and unscrewed the things that held his mattress up so he would fall when he lay down on it. When he got back after working out with a friend, he thew his bag on the bed and it collapsed. The found not one *but* 2 screw drivers left under the bed they put 2 and 2 together and decided he should wear a sling to classes the next day. The girls who pulled the prank asked what happened and he said "my bed gave out and my elbow got pinned in a weird place fracturing the bone." The girls started crying and admitting to the prank apologizing profusely. He then reached out with the "broken" are in a way you could tell it was 100% fine and said "It's okay. On the bright side I found 2 screwdrivers under my bed!"  









 I think they are implying it's type 1 because you can't cure it right now. You can be rid of type 2 with exercise.  




 Winner
