 Wow thank you SO much! I just started getting into SFX makeup so your comment made me grin like a fool :D 














 Your foundation is too light. Maybe its the because its the lighting but it looks one/two shades too light. Try getting new foundation and having an associate help match the color! 




 Ive never used blush because I'm afraid my skin is too dark (NC40) but i really want to check this line out.... is it limited edition? Or will MAC be selling it for a while?  




 Dear Zachary

hands-down bet documentary ever. it was such an emotional rollercoaster 




 I'm not 21 so ill see if i can arrange something for the beer (I live near a family owned brewery) and ill look into NC candies!  




 ah sorry, thought it was a NC thing. i've never seen it anywhere else 




 i was thinking Cheerwine. Is that big in flordia? 




 Youre the best! its a japanese drink, and heres what it looks like http://upload.lsforum.net/users/public/i41908img836-2j104.jpg (sorry for the formatting, im on mobile)

i can send some soft drinks from my state that you cant find outside of the south, if youre willing to exchange!  




 PLEASE tell me they carry CC Lemon! ive been looking for that stuff for months but the one asian market near me doesnt carry Japanese snacks :( 




 I've posted a couple times in this sub and I have ALMOST hit the pan on on my IT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation powder foundation. 

I'm currently looking for a new foundation to try out, but I dont really want to wear powder again. I feel like the coverage is too light to cover up all my flaws and it flakes when I use concealer.

Are there any foundations that are dont appear too oily and wont make drive my face demons insane?  




 What products would you recommend for someone with oily acne-prone skin? I've tried products from pr and IT cosmetics but they only make my face look cakey :/ 




 AM: I wash my face with Philosophy Purity and dab on a little moisturizer before priming (I have a very oily face) 

PM: I use an oil based makeup remover for the eyes, the Philosophy Purity Clear gel (it removes makeup) mixed with an exfoliant and then I use with hazel and then add moisturizer before bed

I've had bad acne since I was 11 and now that I'm 17 my skin has improved but the pores around my nose are atrocious 









 Heres my favorite cosplay! I was Taiga Aisaka from ToraDora! http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg 




 I'd link you to the website but im on mobile. Its basically 4 hours of him demonstrating how HE does his beauty routine (priming face, applying foundation, false lashes, etc) and its also a laid back Q A session as well. You also get a goodie bag of his products as a gift for participating  




 Hey ya'll! Im curious if any of you guys have gone to Jeffree Stars showcase "tour"? Im very interested but I dont know if its worth the $140...

So...advice, anyone? 




 They live in Kyoto, but its a host grandmother who is fairly old, and a host dad. I love them to death but they're not exactly in the loop with stuff hahaha. 

That would be AMAZING if we could work something out! I'll send back some Cheerwine, which is North Carolinas specialty drink, if youre interested! 




 There aren't many Asian grocers in NC and the one near me doesn't carry Japanese food :( I tried to get my host family to send me some but they keep saying they are unfamiliar with the soda 




 Sadly I live on the east coast and there is only one Asian grocery store but they specialize in chinese/vietnamese food 




 Hi there! I'm willing to trade any treat or snack from the US for a Japanese drink called "CC Lemon" and a gum called "Acuo" 

Please help a girl out! 




 if youre up for a bold lip, i'd go for Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in Carina! its such a bright pink but not too overpowering :)

But if you dont want to pay alot, I'd suggest Colour Pop Lippie Stix in Cheers
