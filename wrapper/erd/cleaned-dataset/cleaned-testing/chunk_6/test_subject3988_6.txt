 Five (though possibly more to come) schools, containing in total over 1000 pupils, were found to have been 'taken over' by Muslims with extremist beliefs. The classrooms were covered in posters written only in Arabic, they were heavily pressured to fast and there are reports of any non Muslim children being insulted by teachers, particularly regarding the way they dressed. Islam was covered extensively in the curriculum but Christianity was never touched on. Known extremists were brought in to speak to the kids. Some school governors have been removed but there are fears it's a lot more widespread as parents have now made hundreds of accusations. 




 Thats the thing about depression, it wears you dowj and takes away your hope of recovery. I had a really bad reaction to lexapro and refused treatment for a while after that, but most people I speak to say medication eventually helped them once they found the right one. You dont want to live the rest of your life like this so consider leaving all treatment options available, particularly ones that are known to have helped millions of people like meds. All I can think to recommended other than that is a book- Self-Coaching: The Powerful Program to Beat Anxiety and Depression: How to Heal Anxiety and Depression by Joseph J Luciani. I haven't read it personally but a friend of mine did a few months ago and swears by it.

Good luck 




  We don't have a contract yet

That's really what it comes down to. As far as I can see through what you have written you have no legal protection. What work have you put into the business exactly? 

Unfortunately it is looking like you've messed up big time by getting other people involved and still not doing any legal work at all. Technically, the idea isn't yours. He can use it and produce it as his own business, its a shitty move but it happens all the time.

As others have said, threaten to sue. Talk to anyone who could help you put together a legal (or even legal looking) threat about this and generally scare the shit out of him. Tell him that you will ensure any investors are aware of these legal threats. 

If possible perhaps you could quickly set up a competitor (I guess you understand the business better than him and coders are easy to find).
