 Seriously? How about being less of a dick than you are now.  




 This one sticks out to me.


So when I was younger, I had this friend whose house was down the road from me. So I could literally walk there in a few minutes.

His house was this big, old Victorian style house that had been painted mostly red with a red shingle roof, we always joked and called it the barn house. 

The two scariest locations in his house was his basement (this big, stone walled, dirt floor cellar) and his attic, which you couldn't actually get up into unless you accessed it through a hatch on the roof. 

So being good friends, I would stay at his house for days at a time, even on week days when we had school because we got on the same bus and him being an only child, I felt bad for him having no one to hang out with. 

His attic was super scary because every once in a while, you would hear what sounded like someone walking around in big, heavy work boots that would walk from one end of the attic to the other. 

But his basement was even scarier, it only had a single light which hung from the center of the room, it was one of those pull chain lightbulbs. So it barely lit the room up. 

Sometimes, at night, if you went into the kitchen, and if the door leading down to the basement was open, you'd be compelled to glance down into the darkness and sometimes (both of us as well as several of my friends cousins and some of our other friends had seen it as well) would see what looked like a tall figure wearing a cloak, standing at the bottom of the stairs. 


Maybe the most memorable thing, though was when he found an old tape deck in the basement, the kind you could record tapes on, it wasn't a small tape recorder, it was one of those big things. Anyway it had a couple tapes with it, so one weekend while I was staying the night, me and him were playing around with it and recording ourselves having "interviews" with each other, stupid kid things. 

Well, we then decided to erase the tapes and record ourselves sleeping, as he had decided to sleep in the living room with me. I think we wanted to see how many times we snored or something like that, I can't quite remember. 

So we settled down and set the recorder on the table and eventually fell asleep. 

The next morning, we listened through about two hours worth of recording, about 15 or so minutes of us talking back and forth before we finally fell asleep, and almost two hours in, very near the end of the tape, we heard this single, quiet, raspy voice that was so low you could barely hear it. It said something along the lines of "They're sleeping. Yes, they're sleeping. We shouldn't disturb them. Not tonight, we wait."

I remember the voice sounded something inhuman, it sounded almost like what Gollum sounds like in Lord of the rings, but much raspier and quieter. 

It's one of those things that still sends shivers down my spine, and I wish one of us still had the tape.  




 Well, given that hell is not a real place, nor is heaven, they are both just concepts of the mind. If you believe that you are going to the biblical version of hell when you die, then that is where the remains of your sub conscience takes you. Same with the biblical version of heaven.

However, I heard tell of a friend of my grandmothers, who was deathly afraid of clowns (if you can imagine a 90 year old lady terrified of clowns lol) several days before she died, she would scream "Don't let the clowns take me there!" So I can only imagine that her version of "hell" was full of clowns.
