 I've seen pictures of /u/EtTuTortilla, and when he's writing for /r/cryosleep he looks just like [this](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/pulp-o-mizer/layers/fg_single_characters/thumbs/Robot_Detective.jpg) so it works out. 




 Frowned upon? Maybe. There's no rule against it, but consider if everyone did that.

It's pretty unlikely that a title will make that much of a difference either. People don't upvote the title, they upvote the body. Getting momentum to get to the front page and attract the most views is based on the story (as it should be).

Not saying you couldn't, or that it wouldn't make the difference in this case, but if every writer did that every time, the place would be flooded with stories that readers already made a decision about.

Best to just move on to writing the next story. Maybe come back to that one again if it's still on your mind. Re-read it, edit it, make changes, *then* re-post it. 




 People are used to being sold to. They'd hardly blink if you had options to pour money into a Paypal account and links to your Kickstarter. They see that all the time. I don't think anyone would really going to think twice of it -- and you're not even doing that!

Hopefully you know you're a good writer. So just talk about what you like about your writing, and if you need help coming up with more, we're here. 




 The "Random Story" feature took me to part 4 of something longer, and there wasn't a link there to get to part 1.

I'm on mobile, but the font at the top isn't especially impressive. Maybe it's nothing, but a plain web font spelling out a headline that you'd find [here](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/pulp-o-mizer/pulp-o-mizer.html) just didn't flow for me. 




 The self-deprecating humor is overdone I think. One of the benefits of the site is to help sell your work, so talk it up! 

Edit: Also, I just hate the word "stuff." 




 You did the narration of this? It's great! You've got an excellent voice for it. 




 Hi, thanks for doing an AMA. 

Why Horror?

What are your criteria for something that's "good enough?" Like three most important things that a story must have.

Good luck with your pub. Sounds fun! 




 Wow that was really an experience to hear and see the video along with it. That's exciting to see this sort of collaboration done right. Hope to see more in the future! 




 Many women *are* capable drivers. 




 I'm in agreement with /u/JMFargo here. There's no real action, and therefore I don't even think that this would be allowed to be posted to /r/nosleep. It's not really a story, it's just a collection of facts.

It might be possible to frame it as a found journal entry, but even then I would suggest cutting it down to the first and last paragraphs to keep it interesting. Whoever found the journal would then become the main character, and it's important for the audience to have a connection with them.

Tell what happened, and what's happening while building tension for what might happen in the future. 




 *1... 2... 3...*

*What was that sound? There's someone there.*

"Hello?" I spoke to the empty darkness of my room. A passing car's high beams scanned the walls, showing their emptiness.

*Sigh*

*1... 2... 3...*

*Another noise. What is that? This is pointless. I am just so bored. Does counting sheep actually work for anyone?*

---

This was me.

Straight out of high school my best friend Trevor and I got full-time jobs at his uncle's machine shop and rented a house together. It seemed like a dream come true until the first few months Long (often unpaid) hours and tenuous attention to detail wore me out. I spent my days drowsing and nodding off, but by night I was hypervigilant. Weariness allowed an opening for anxiety, which just made the nights worse.

I fell asleep at work, right in the middle of riveting a long piece of sheet metal. People don't realize how sharp sheet metal really is until they try to run their hand along the edge of it. Without the edge folded and rivets installed, Johnny, who was sanding the rough edges off the metal was met with the straight edge of the sheet. The knifelike metal slid through his leather glove and two fingers like they were Easter Peeps.

Trev's uncle fired me just as easily.

That night, Trevor found me huddled and crying in the kitchen one frustrated night. I told him I'd do anything for it to just stop. He pried the knife from my hands. Good friend that he was, he went with me to seek help.

Talking about it just felt like a waste of time. Something about the couch, the dim light and the dulcet tones of my therapist put weights in my eyes. She woke me up and I hated her for it.

On my way out, I passed one of those corkboard announcement boards, the kind with all the thumbtacks in them and Polaroids of motorcycles and couches for sale. I couldn't avoid noticing it because in a split second something black as obsidian shot through the doors of the reception area and hurtled straight into the board. The Kamikaze object turned out to be a crow, now dead on the floor. On the corkboard, across a white page printed with fading ink was now a splash of blood.

**Sleep Study Trials**
Now looking for applicants with a history of Insomnia, anxiety or fitful sleep.
Fair compensation offered.

I stood stunned, looking at the notice and at God's departed creature. Then I took out my phone and snapped pictures of them. Trevor wouldn't believe this.

For some reason, I hadn't expected him to read the notice or care what it said.

"You're going, right?" He asked when I showed him.

"Going where?"

"To the sleep study. Call tomorrow and set it up."

"Oh. No, I don't think that's really..."

"It's like *fate* or something."

"Yeah, right."

"Really, though. They give compensation. It sounds kind of perfect. I think you should call."

I watched infomercials all night that night, and the next day I called and they gave me an appointment for that same afternoon. If I'd had any prior expectations of what a sleep study would entail, they were disbanded quickly. I was directed to go to someone's house, rather than, say, a hospital or the community college. The researcher (I hesitate to say doctor) was in stained sweatpants, and answered the door juggling a bowl of cereal and a Pabst.

I should have left right then. Any sane person would have, and maybe that's why I say this: Something in his eye made me stay. The feeling was like crossing a mother bear and her cubs when hiking in the woods; like tripping while changing shingles on the roof; like not being sure that you've got enough air to swim to the surface of the lake. It was that moment, the tickle in my gut of suppressed panic that made me stay. I knew immediately that this man wasn't human at all.

"Hey," he said.

"Uh, hi." It took me a second to extract myself from the depths of his eyes. "I'm, uh, here for the, uh, sleep study?"

"Mm," he said before swallowing a sip of beer. "It's over."

"Oh, okay. Sorry." I fully intended to leave then. A failed venture. Dear diary, today I tried something and it didn't work. My body stood facing the man half in his doorway. "I just called, this morning and they said... I found your poster..."

The bath-robed God glanced over his shoulder into the confines of his dark house. *Really* dark, like it could have been a train tunnel that went back and back forever.

"Look, I'm busy right now. I've got friends over. I can do a house call tonight if you want, just remember to leave the lights on."

"O-" I didn't even get to "K" when he shut the door.

*Leave the lights on?*

Trevor asked how things went.

"Kind of weird," was all I said.

"Well how much money did they give you?"

"Nothing yet."

"... Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Sorry, I'm fine. Just tired, you know? So fucking tired..."

"Alright. I'm going to bed."

"Okay. I'm going to stay up a while."

Trevor disappeared down the hallway and I readied the TV remote.

*Leave the lights on.*

Now soaking in the TV rays alone, it sunk in just how creepy that was. For one thing, he didn't know anything about me. Two, what was he going to do? Just watch me sleep? And for three...

*Out.*

Dead out like a fucking light. I slept in the broken down La-Z-Boy until noon the next day. 14 hours. I woke up because I was hungry, and once I'd eaten I went back to sleep in the bed that had until now just taken up space in my room.

 Good job. Go for it! 




 Nice job! 




 Well then you can do it again! 









 Yeah credit is good. I'm pretty lenient with permissions, so no qualms from me. If you make a million dollars from it, I'd like some. 




 Interesting. I didn't know you did readings.

I look forward to hearing it with the rest of the world. You've got creative license to do as you want with it.  




 Just the first part. 

Is that a real accent? How are you able to turn it on an off? Whatever is more comfortable for you.

Unfortunately it comes with the territory of being a storytelling sub and not a professional writing publication. I'm certainly guilty of not finishing series. Does it feel bad leaving it unfinished? Yeah, but there are lots of things that can go wrong and make me lose interest. 




 I appreciate it. Nice job on the list too. Thanks for making the community even better than it already is.

  fuck everything.

We should set up a date. 




 Like so much misfortune in my life, the seeds of these events were planted from my fathers words. Concise, if not eloquent, he always knew how to cut to my center.

Did you fuck any girls, yet? Probably not. And to think, all that college poon, just wasted on a queer like you.

He was drunk again. The fifth night in a row and every night since Id been home between college terms. The thing is, I wasnt a queer... at least I was pretty sure that I wasnt.

For reasons unknown in my early (to not-so-early) years I just wasnt interested in sex. It hadnt really been a problem until high school and then it seemed like it was just getting worse since then. Now it was obvious that I was behind the times. It seemed like everyone I knew had at least been with someone, and it was becoming a source of anxiety.

Ironically, my father's stream of vitriol was what prompted me to cement my sexual preferences once and for all. I resolved that once I got back to school, I would do it. Id have sex. After all, isnt getting to know yourself what college is supposed to be all about?

If I was gay, I knew that I couldnt tell anyone. My own parents would kick me out of the house -- and that was if my father didnt try to strangle it out of me first.

But I had to know.

I normally spent a lot of my nights alone in my room but my two roommates, John and Macy were not those kind of people. Every weekend it seemed like they were setting out to a bar or an event or a party. They usually invited me as a polite formality, and I could see the surprise on their face when the first Friday night back, I accepted. I almost felt bad, until John started acting really excited to have me along. Whether or not he was pretending, I couldnt tell.

We went to a house party at some friends of Macys. Her and John seemed to know everyone, and each of those people knew everyone as else, interconnected in a web of sort of reverse web that I couldnt penetrate. I tried not to hang on John and Macy, but my awkwardness was filling the house, and left me gasping for some fresh air.

Outside, through the haze of Marlboros, Camels and Newports, is when I first saw *her*. She was beautiful. Cropped, white-blonde hair hung down along the flawless pale skin of her neck. Blue eyes as deep as the Pacific pierced through the smoke... *at me*.

Its clich, but she was so perfect that my breath caught in my throat. The smoke burned until I choked and coughed it out. When I looked up through tear-streamed eyes, I saw her smile at me and then take a sip of beer from the bottle.

John burst out of the house and grabbed onto my arm, taken with a sudden acute case of close-talking-itis. Alex! Alex! Were going to a strip club, come on!

What? No, man. Im having fun here.

Look, Macy mentioned that youre a virgin, and everybodys going to go for you to see your first pair.

She told you that?

Its not exactly the worlds best-kept secret, man. Come on!

I looked for the girl, but she must have gone back inside.

Fuck. Fine. Alright.

Fuck yeah! Ever been to one before?

Nope.

We packed at least a dozen people and their drinks into Johns tiny sedan. The club was named after a color. Turquoise or Magenta or something. It hardly matters, Im not writing a recommendation for the place anyway. I was just getting to the point of drunkenness where I wasnt afraid to speak my mind.

This is just kind of sad, I said.

Macy was the only one that heard. What?

I mean... These people, theyre trapped here. Like they have to do this.

What, you mean the girls?

Yeah, the girls, but the guys too, guys who would come to a place like this. I mean, they realize that nothing is going to happen with these girls, right?

Would you lighten up? No wonder youre a virgin. She turned around and grabbed a girl by the arm. How much for a lap dance?

For you, honey?

For my friend. First timer.

Oh alright. She glanced at me through caked on makeup. I wondered how many kids she had. How you doing? Having fun tonight? Just sit back and relax.

Only, I couldnt relax. Every time the disco lights spun, I could see the pimples on her lower back. She had horrible skin. Before she moved my hands away, Id felt what I was pretty sure was a C-section scar arcing across her sandpaper skin. Cigarette stained teeth gave her a smile like Gollums.

I was repulsed, and pushed her off. As I stormed out of the bar, people called out to me, but it was drowned out by the music. John caught up with me outside.

What the fuck was that, Alex?

Thats not fun for me. Its gross. Gross and its sad. I just dont want to do it anymore.

Its not gross! Theyre boobs! Come on.

Its just not for me.

What are you, gay?

Maybe.

Ew. What? ... Wait, are you serious? Youre a- His face showed fear. I remember that of all the things to be afraid of, that had to be the most ridiculous.

Mercifully, he shut up. I dont know if he said anything else after that. I was around the corner.

I felt the smile on my face before I realized what I was feeling. Only then, I worked my way back in my mind to what Id just done.

Come out.

My smile turned to the ugly kind you make just before you cry, and I got a lump in my throat. This was happening. Was I really gay? Well, I didnt know for sure. John probably thought I was now. He'd tell everyone.

I thought about dad for a second. It made me feel afraid. It wasnt the first time that the distance of college to my home town had comforted me. But still, something scared me about... well... *myself*.

They say that you fear what you dont know, but this just didnt work that way. I couldnt just know. There wasnt a blood test for sexuality. You can't just decide. This was something bigger than me and yet inside me.

Thoughts and questions swirling in my head, I was sure of just one thing; I needed another fucking drink.

All-American Pizza Companys neon sign bathed me in red, white and blue as I walked in. The front of the shop was the restaurant and in the back was a hole-in-the-wall bar that Id seen but never been inside. I ordered a long island iced tea and lit a smoke, and as I exhaled that first drag, there she was, swaying her hips as she strolled through the crowded, busy bar straight toward me.

My names Alex, she said.

My name is Alex.

Thats fun. Ive never been with a guy named Alex before.

*Oh fuck.*

She sat next to me and stole my cigarette. Wanna do some shots?

My memory is a blur after that. Disjointed scenes of a foreign taxi driver screaming Dont soil my seats! the feeling of her biting my lower lip with her front teeth, pulling me into her, sneaking through a dingy hallway into a tiny apartment, the only furniture a bed and a huge mirror, throwing up in a toilet, blood, razors on a nightstand, drips of red staining white sheets. And Alex had a penis.

And I couldnt have cared less. She was perfect.

I woke up the next morning laying on threadbare stained carpet. Sunlight shone through the windows and became tinted orange-brown by the fly strips hanging there. I found the bathroom on the other side of the empty kitchen. The sink didnt work, and drying blood covered the porcelain and the floor. I yakked again in the toilet.

*What the fuck happened last night?*

Lifting myself up from the position of prayer, I noticed a cut on my finger. An image of her sucking blood from the cut jumped into my mind.

Otherwise unhurt, but more than a little unsettled, I searched the apartment for my clothes. Alexs thin, naked frame didnt stir as I tried to avoid the spots in the floor that creaked loudly. There were cuts on her arms.

I felt her pulse just to make sure she was alive, but I wasnt ready to wake her up and face what Id done last night. I needed some time to process it. As I knelt next to the bed, something shiny under her pillow caught my eye. A gun.

I found the door and left.

The next day an unknown number called and texted my phone. 

You didnt say goodbye.

Lets meet up today.

Didnt you have a good time?

Every time I got one, I started typing a response, but something stopped me from sending any of them. Something wasnt right about Alex. I was afraid of them.

Whatever it was that scared me about her didnt stop me from calling them the next weekend after most of a bottle of Jack Daniels. And the next weekend, and the next.

Id come home with scratches on my back, my lips and tongue sore and chapped. I was worn out from doing things that I didnt remember. Every time Id wake up in her shit hole apartment and sneak out without waking her up. This became my new routine.

I met another girl. Her name was Ashley and she was in my Shakespeare class, though we only realized that after wed talked a few times online. We took things slow. Partly because thats what felt right, but also to keep her from finding the marks that appeared on my body every weekend.

Things were going well until she asked me to meet her friends over the weekend for pizza. You can probably guess the place. I paused for a moment in the glow of the red, white and blue sign.

Hey. Everything alright? Ashley asked.

Yeah. Feeling a little sick, thats all.

Well, do you need to go home?

*Yes. I need desperately to leave, to run away and figure myself out. I need to know what the fuck is going on.*

Im fine. Lets go in.

Her friends were great. They were mostly from her church groups and were almost as awkward as me. After the second round of beers, I got up to use the bathroom that was shared with the bar.

For some reason that I couldnt place, just as I opened the door, I could picture Alex behind it, waiting for me. The bathroom was empty, but my phone buzzed with a text.

Whos the new girl?

I had yet to respond to one of Alexs texts,  but this was it. I went into the stall and sat down, and as I was typing I got this back.

Does she want to join in?

I hit send. Its over. I cant see you anymore.

I sighed and rolled my shoulders, letting some of the pent-up tension out of them. Why did I still feel like she was going to jump out at me?

*Buzz.*

Its not over. Youve got my blood on your hands, Alex.

Blood. It hit me. The bathroom smelled like her apartment had when Id woken up that first night. A smell that tasted like pennies, it permeated the bathroom. The smell of blood.

Dont text or call anymore. I typed Sorry at the end, but erased it. *Send*

I went back and joined Ashley and her friends. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I silenced it.

We went bowling and had more drinks. I had fun. This was a healthy relationship, and I felt better and better about leaving Alex behind.

By the time we got back to my place, I think we both knew where the night was going. I invited her over for Netflix. Not even a specific movie. It was around midnight.

It looked like John and Macy had fallen asleep on the couch in front of the television, and in drunken loud whispers we giggled and crept by them to my room. I opened the door for Ashley, and she got about halfway in before her body went rigid. She made a sound like shed been plunged into ice water.

At first I didnt see anything. The only light was from the glowing moon coming through the blinds, casting slanting rays. Almost invisible against the sheets, then I saw her eyes first. Alex. And she was holding a gun.

Ashley ran. I was frozen in place.

She didnt know about us, I take it?

Get out.

No, you come in, Alex. Oh, you can come anywhere you want, she writhed around on the bed, arching her back seductively, drawing the muzzle of the gun down her ribs like ivory piano keys. Shut the door, hon. Wouldnt want your roommates to hear us.

I didnt move. Her playful smile dropped away. Her voice was low, and demanding, it scared the shit out of me. Shut the fucking door.

*Would Ashley call the police?* I wondered. *Or would she think that I was expecting to find a mad gun-wielding transsexual in my bed? How long would it take if she did call?*

I entered the room.

Lock it.

*Click*

Alex, dont you want me anymore?

No. I managed to get out through my dry, quivering lips.

That hurts, Alex, it really does. I even brought something special for you tonight, you know.

She picked up something from the floor next to the bed that I hadnt seen before. Some kind of... machine? I didnt know what it was. It was made of metal, and was a collection of joints and screws and levers.

A-Alex, I stammered, What is that?

Well I know just what you like, Alex. How to get you off. But theres always been something between us. She giggled. A penis between us. Get it?

I thought that I heard sirens.

Alex was assembling the clamps, twisting the wingnuts and tightening everything around her genitals.

The police vehicle continued on and the whine of its sirens faded. Not for me.

Ready for the big show?

She pulled two long levers. Black blood shot out across the room. Undiscernable connecting tissue -- ligaments, blood vessels, tubes full of every bodily fluid imaginable -- the whole glob was pulled out onto the foot of the bed. The smell was fucking incredible. Animal and clinical at the same time. Something woke inside me.

She lifted a slender hand, gloved in blood and waved me forward.

The whole time she hadnt made a sound, but as I started to thrust, she began to scream.

John and Macy knocked on the door. I heard John ask Are you okay in there? After a few minutes, they went away. 




 All in all, a pretty fun weekend.

 Paradise Pine. Look it up. 




 Well, you nailed that.  




 Dude, thanks. I love this.

I really liked this story because it gives some cool pieces but there might be more than one way to put them together.

You're right that it's probably more Dark Fantasy than Horror. Glad you still somewhat enjoyed it. 









 71-year-old Walter Simon was a...

Well, actually, there isn't anything interesting that's known about Walter. He just seems like a regular guy. The only thing that any of his neighbors knew about Walter was that he had a coconut tree growing in his front yard -- seemingly the only one in the state.

It's what is *un*known that's interesting.

Twice, Walter has seen a man walking swiftly through the woods behind his house, holding a very long, silver string. The first time was as a child. Young Walter pressed his nose against the glass and then peeked around the steam that his breath had left.

The second time, Walter was a young man in Vietnam. It was late, and he was the only person awake in the camp. When the man walked by carrying the string, Walter ran after him, trying to find out who he was.

This morning, as Walter went into his garage to put food out for his cats, Percival and Missy, he found a dead body. The blood had soaked into the oil stains in the center of the concrete floor.

Not being one to panic or despair, Walter continued to put food in his cats bowls, and decided to come back to the body later when he'd had his coffee.

It was fast approaching midnight, and Walter was sitting at his dining room table, staring over a pile of bills and out the rear window of his house. Staring, and thinking of what to do about the deceased gentleman in his garage. 

Walter isn't one to dwell on the past, and so the question of "How did he get there?" is brushed aside in favor of the more practical "What can be done now?"

A tiny sliver of light waves and dances, dragging across the trees and brush in his back yard. The silver string gives off a faint light.

He must hurry.

Walter emptied his largest duffel bag of its contents. He laid it on the floor of the garage, and rolled the body into it. A bit heavy, but he managed to stand with it. Once up and with his balance intact, the dead weight draped over his shoulders, Walter carried the body out into his back yard.

He *must* hurry.

The branches slapped and scratched at his face, and the unlevel, wet ground nearly causes him to lose his footing, but then he spotted it, just ahead, snagged on a broken limb. The string.

Walter looped the bit of silver through the handles, then around the bag, then back through the handles. He remembered how to tie a good strong knot. When he's done, he wipes the silver residue from his hands and gets back to his feet.

The slack went out of the line. It tugged, then dragged its new burden slowly and steadily across the forest floor, and just before it went out of sight, Walter gave his very smartest salute to the moon. 




 Really like those first two lines. 




 You're* 




 The tricky part is that you don't always know what a problem is. Air conditioning went out? Well last time it was the condenser, but this time it's low on coolant. Girlfriend is crying?  Last time it was because the cat died. Never mind that you forgot your anniversary. 




 How is this different from other air hand dryers that blow stuff everywhere? Don't touch it, someone cleans it a couple times a day...

If the thing gets my hands dry without touching paper towels and garbage cans, I generally like it. 




 Looks good to me. It's good that it lays flat, and lets you put any kind of paper so you can use your fountain pens with it. 




 No "in use" photos?

These look awesome! 




 We should be teaching porn in schools. 




 Gotta get that karma at the last minute! 




 And thus, the Human Centipede was born!

Oh, wait, no, I mean Batman, and it was a cellar full of bats. 




 I liked it. I've been thinking lately how stories don't really *get* me very often anymore... That one creeped me out for some reason. 




 There's a word limit.

It's the perfect crime! No one would suspect parafin wax as the murder weapon! 









 Do this all over, everywhere. 




 That was great! I was guessing dystopian future island-ghetto the whole time. 









 It all started when Phil Harris and I made fourteen cheese quesadillas in his microwave. The only thing that halted our N64, cheese and Mountain Dew binge was that we ran out of cheddar.

When Phil's mom found out we'd eaten the entire block, she was mad -- so mad, in fact, that she made up a story about Bobby Wilson, who'd lived next door until about a year ago, and how he'd died from eating too much cheese.

We knew that Bobby hadn't died. We also knew that he might not have completely understood that he was moving *away* and not passing onto the afterlife. Before he'd gone, Bobby had given away several of his most prized possessions. Who were we to deny the wishes of a ~~dying~~ confused 7-year-old?

That's how we got *the ball*. Technically, Phil got the ball and I got Bobby's transparent green N64 controller with the joystick that never got loose. At the time, I thought I'd gotten the better end of the deal; dirty baseball  N64 controller. It took some time to realize that everything was not as it seemed.

Baseball became the new thing to do on the playground. It was like Pokemon, yo-yos and wall ball all rolled into one. All Phil had to do was throw that ball into the air and we came a'running. Only something in the dynamic had changed. Instead of lighthearted laughter and playing just for fun, kids were making bets.

I remember the day that I saw my first hundred dollar bill -- a kid named Marcus Pratt slid it from his pocket and laid it on the pile of treasured toys and trinkets. He'd stolen it from his father, and spent the rest of recess losing it. He came back the next day with a black eye, but other kids came with cash.

Things started to get out of control. Phil almost got suspended for threatening the teacher with a bat and screaming "The inning isn't over! It's **not over**!"

That game ended in a hurry, and Phil was carried off by his ear. In the scramble for the pot, I lost track of the ball.

Things went back to normal like when a rubber band's been stretched and then released. Me and Phil looked for the ball a few times, but whoever had it wasn't going to fess up. Maybe it was the same person that grabbed almost $300 stashed in a Johnny Bravo lunchbox. Maybe they just didn't know what they had. Or maybe they *did* know, and didn't want it to continue.

Anyway.

I was at Phil Harris's house a year later with an uncomfortable twist in my gut, either because it's full of melted cheese and soggy tortilla or because his mom is lecturing him about doing nothing but eating and playing video games inside all day, which I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be listening to or giving a respectfully wide berth. In both options I decide I'm not going to make eye contact, and so I'm looking around his bedroom.

At the edge of this closet was this dirty old baseball. I wouldn't have even known or thought that it was *the ball* except that right at that moment, Susan Harris came up with this B.S. story about how Bobby Wilson died from staying inside too much.

Phil's mom finally decided that she'd said enough, leaving us in an awkward silence, Goldeneye on pause.

I pointed. "Is that...?"

Phil was quick, but I was closer. I snatched the ball up from the floor as he dove, a ball of lanky limbs that knocked his closet door off the hinges. We listened for the sounds of Susan again, but when they didn't come, I held up the ball.

"It was you!"

"It was too much."

"What?"

"Too much responsibility. Things were getting... weird."

"But all those kids... All that *money*!"

"It wasn't the same! It wasn't fun anymore. It was like... fighting. Like we were all fighting each other. I just wanted things to go back to normal."

"Normal? Do you know how much money I lost that day, Phil? That's not *normal*, it's child abuse! You don't get to decide. What we do at recess is our own decision."

"Hey, that's my ball!"

"Oh yeah? Well if it's yours, then how come I'm holding it, and you've got nothing?"

I threw the ball into the air. Something about the way the seams spun, or the noise it made as it smacked back into my palm... God, could anything ever feel *so right* as that ball?

"I"ll play you for it."

I had him.

The first time I ran for office, people didn't know what had hit them. In the county and state levels of government, people thought it was just a novelty; anything that I couldn't settle through negotiations and debate, I put up to a game of baseball. I lost a few games here and there, but won the Democratic bid for New York's senate seat in an a back-alley dirt lot in Philadelphia.

By the time I was running for president, people knew exactly what I was about. They voted for me because a world where the outcome is determined by baseball and not by the guy with the biggest wallet or the biggest military. Hell, I thought so too.

But the games are not as fun any more. Since (usually) no one dies, there's little cost of having a conflict. So they never stop.

I've committed my life to playing baseball for this country, but I wonder. How many more lifetimes will it take before we resolve anything? 




 Mom found my sketchbook again today.

When Dad finds it, he just hits me and yells. I almost prefer it; at least its over quickly. Its Moms method to sit me down and explain why what Im doing is wrong. I dont agree, and she wont change my mind, it just feels like it takes forever. Everyone has heard the story a million times since they were children. I dont know what she expects to happen.

The story goes like this: 

The creators redesigned the world with two cities. Two being the perfect number of cities to have on a planet like ours. This one, the one we live in now, is named Alpha. The other, Gamma.

The city of Alpha was made perfect in every way; Utopia. The creators designed it specially for their favored creations -- us -- to inhabit. Before the creators wiped the world clean and started anew, there was war, disease, suffering, *imperfection*. Not anymore.

Little is known about Gamma, other than its location. The twin city is located exactly 180 degrees around the planet from Alpha; 7,547 miles in any direction. Still more evidence of the creators perfect design. Who would we wage war against? Where would a sickness evolve? How would it travel? The two cities are perfectly separated.

But that was in the beginning; ancient history. Over time, the creators city faded and wore down. We were shown how to use it, not to fix or build it. The creators left us alone too soon. 

My grandparents grew up in this same house that my parents and I are living in now, but had lived their whole lives never having used electricity. The electronic panels on the walls, now an indispensable wealth of information and communication, had sat dark and dormant their whole lives. For decades, the waste system lay in disrepair. Human waste -- shit, piss, even our dead -- was dumped over the wall and, with great effort (due to the smell), ignored. 

I said before that the two cities were perfectly separated. They were, that is, until Alvis Frost was born. 

A genius inventor, even as a child, it was rumored that the boy was half creator himself. At 13, he re-designed the waste incinerator so that the ashes could be packed into the beautiful clear bricks used to repair the buildings in Alpha. A year later, he re-engineered the water purifier to run self-sufficiently on solar power. Pumps at the purifier pushed it through the dormant system of pipes and into every home in the city. At sixteen, hed constructed a generator that harnessed the heat emanating from the planets core. When power was supplied to the main hub, the city came alive again.

During that  that the generator was being built, Alvis constructed a flying machine. It would be his last invention. 

A commission led by the mayor himself attempted to block his departure. Alvis was nearly arrested, even threatened to be killed, but in the end he struck a deal. He would return within one year, whether he found Gamma or not, and only after he had ensured that the citizens of Alpha would be able to maintain the technology that he had resurrected. Frost waited patiently. Slowly, the people caught on. In a few years time, Alpha was nearly restored to its former self.

Finally, the day came for him to leave, and so he did, shrinking into the West, until he was nothing more than a black dot, too small to be seen.

Nine days later, another dot appeared in the Eastern sky. He had returned. The citizens of Alpha welcomed him with open arms. My mother was there. She said that she thought that it was odd that he never smiled, even when everyone was so happy to have him back. She feared that Gamma was gone. Alvis retreated into his home, saying only that he needed to prepare, and no one saw him again for several weeks. 

Then out of the blue, he called a meeting of all the citizens of Alpha. Assembled there together, he put up a picture on the screen. It was the generator that hed designed. He explained how it operated, and what it was meant to do. Next, he showed them the water purifier, and how to use the brick byproducts to repair the structures of the city. He showed them the computer panels, how they lit up when electricity was connected to them, and they could be used to access a wealth of information.

The people of the city were confused -- why was he telling them what they already knew? Hed made sure to teach them these things before hed left. Had he forgotten? Did he not realize that hed come back to Alpha?

Then the truth came out. My name is not Alvis Frost. This city is not Alpha. My name is Hudson Link, and Ive just come from the real Alpha, the one Ive shown you in these pictures.

Ive come to the conclusion that chance alone could not account for the similarities between the cities. It cant explain the way that I look identical to someone born and raised here. It cant explain the... *bond* that exists between us.

Ive been through Alvis Frosts records. It took some time to be sure, but I can now say with confidence that they are precisely identical. Events in this city coincide with those in Gamma down to the day, down to the minute, in fact, to the very second. As I raise my hand on this side of the planet, Alvis Frost raises his in Alpha. As youve gathered here, your twins, differing only by name, have gathered around Mr. Frost. When I set out West on my journey here to Gamma... Alvis too struck out to the West. *Everything* is synchronized. *Everyone* is connected in this way.

They thought that Alvis was crazy. That his nine day journey had caused him to snap, losing track of where he was and even his own name. Of course, never having left the walls of Alpha, no one had seen anything like it.

They had him committed. It was for his own good, they said. Locked in the room of the tower for observation, he fell violently ill. They further separated him from having contact with anyone else. The mayor made it exceedingly clear that no one was to go near him. A disease had been contracted outside the wall; it wasnt safe.

That winter, as the first dusting of snow fell, Hudson Link succumbed to his sickness and died. They say that they found his body leaned against the Western wall of his cell.

The snow in Alphas streets rose and fell as winter came and went. People thought that that was the end.

... Until a speck appeared on the Eastern horizon. It grew as it crawled closer. Eventually they saw that it was a man.

Alvis Frost had returned. Sun-burnt, frost-bitten, starved and nearly a year older, but alive. Once Alvis -- the *real* Alvis -- had fallen ill, the mayor of Gamma (who indeed called themselves Alpha), had sent him back out of the city in order to keep the illness from spreading to anyone else. His flying machine had crashed over a range of mountains, forcing him to go the rest of the way on foot.

Its strange for me to think that as I pull this pen across the paper, somewhere else, someone who looks and thinks like me is writing the same words somewhere else. That everyone I know in Alpha is all that there is in the world, because their twins are just copies of them.

My mom tells me that because of this, its wrong to draw faces in my sketchbook. I dont understand it. Its like she thinks that by drawing them, Im creating them; causing new people to pop into existence.

And this cant be true, because I am not a creator. There *are* no more creators.

Are there? 




 [Spoiler](/s "They're not links.") 




 And by "wing it," they mean show up, burst into tears and admit exactly what they did all weekend. 




 ... they talked extensively about what they would tell him in order to cover up what happened. Then they got too confused and just decided to wing it. 




 Showing, not telling is generally the advice that's given to beginning writers. If you're showing, then that's most likely a good thing. 




 It just needs more. Nothing is defined yet.

A good speech should be like a woman's skirt; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest.
 -Winston Churchill

Give "the tour guide" a name, and build her as a character. This doesn't have to take a long time (but longer than what you have already).

Use actions to tell about her. Give small details to let the reader make their mind up by themselves. This goes for Zelink also. Don't just *say* that the company provides education and helps the city. Show the tour guide's diploma that they paid for. As she waits to catch the bus, she sees their logo on the sewer grate. And the bench she's sitting on.

This way, the reader knows about her, the company and the city, *and* there's action going on, so it doesn't feel like a paragraph out of a history textbook was pasted into the middle of the story.

Keep writing! 




 [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sk4sx/if_you_attended_memorial_middle_school_dont_talk/)

The title of this subreddit is really perfect. I can't sleep anymore. It's after 2:00 in the morning, but I'm too afraid of what I might see in my dreams.

Last night I had another one. In it, I was short, like a child. I was wearing my favorite Pokemon sweatshirt. Along with several other children, I came to the entrance to a large circus tent. People were pouring in, wearing the gravel path through the door down to puddles and mud filled with brown rainwater. Inside the tent, all the seats in the rickety bleachers were taken. People were standing in the aisles, and the children and I moved down near the barrier that separated the performers from the audience, a metal fence draped with worn colored fabric. I was in the front row. The audience was deafening and lively. Everyone seemed to be really excited for the show to begin.

A short, rotund man in a purple suit lined with hot pink silk and a matching top hat, his mustache greased with vaseline strode into the circle with his arms out wide. He carried a cane, but didn't have a limp. I was close enough to see that the patch on his knee was made of a slightly different color of cloth, and that there was a bit of food clinging to the corner of his mouth, caught in the greasy stubble. He marched in a wide circle, basking in the roaring applause of the crowd. Those who were behind me pressed forward for a better look and smashed me uncomfortably into the railing.

"Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! The moment you've all been waiting for! Tonight, we will witness a man's death --"

The crowd howled at the last word. The ringleader allowed a pause before continuing. I squirmed to look back, unable to believe that the people were in a frenzy in order to see someone die. My parents were there, in the rows of seats directly behind me, smiling and clapping along with the rest of them. My mother, a bank teller who was too reserved to even enjoy watching sports on TV was pumping her fists above her head. The blood had rushed into her face, turning it purple. It was shocking to see her that way.

"-- and resurrection!"

A group of clowns, clinging to their oversized pants and taking exaggerated, wild steps in huge shoes walked in a line around the arena.

"For our first act, we will need a volunteer from our audience."

One of the clowns came so close to where I was standing that I could smell the alcohol on his breath. I heard him burp. The crowd pushed behind me again, and the metal barrier started to move. I was powerless to stop it. The clown caught it in his arms and stopped the barrier from moving further toward the center. The other clowns around the circle were holding the crowd back similarly.

Someone behind me stepped on my ankle, bending it at an odd angle. I dropped to a knee, to relieve the pressure. 

It hurt.

The sharp gravel bit into my knee and the palm of my hand.

In a dream, you can't feel pain, but as the alcoholic clown tried to push the barrier back into its place, I felt the metal press against my face. I tried to get up, but there were too many people. My hand was pinned down into the gravel under someone's shoe. I was stuck, and my pleas for help were drowned in the white hot noise.

The audience erupted in applause again, responding to some unseen event. I shoved my elbow above the person's kneecap, forcing them to lift their foot. My head broke above the surface, and I could see into the center of the tent again. Joining the ringleader was a crumpled body. I recognized the clothes. It was Mr. Rowden and he wasn't moving.

The crowd was going wild. I was in danger. I had to get out. As I pushed through the sea of mad people, the announcer began again.

"From the time we are children, we are told that death is the end of life..."

Someone elbowed me in the nose, hard. My vision faded to inky blackness. Points of light swam and danced in front of my closed eyes. When I could see again, I found my hands streaming in bright red blood.

I was close to the exit. Just a few more steps. A few more rows of cheering people.

I glanced over my shoulder. Mr. Rowden's collapsed form was still laying there, motionless. Nothing had changed. Then he was in front of me, smiling with swollen, red gums and that dead tooth staring like a pupil out of his mouth.

I woke up after that, and screamed like I haven't since I was a child. Blood was streaming from my face and all over my sheets and pillow. In my fit, I'd reopened the stitches that I got in the accident. 

I hate that I'm so afraid. I tried not to think about it for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, that wasn't in the cards.

Dad is a police officer, and he still knows some people from Oregon where I went to middle school and up until a few days ago, college. They're definitely not supposed to share the details of the investigation, but he found out anyway.

The body in Asbahr lake wasn't found by the police. A landscaping company that owns land next to the lake found tire tracks. The owner wanted to make sure that someone wasn't dumping their garbage illegally.  They pulled up the statue with a winch, and once the mud had been cleaned off, they posted on Facebook asking whether anyone had recently had a statue or piece of art stolen. People connected the dots pretty quickly, and the police stepped in.

The outsides of the concrete casing had been chiseled and painted to reflect a slightly-larger-than-life sized version of the person inside. They sent pictures to my dad via email, and seeing it like that sent chills up my spine. It looked real... and imagining going swimming in the lake and seeing a painted version of a person standing on the bottom staring up like that... Well, I can't imagine. The thought is almost as bad as knowing that I almost ended up at the bottom of the lake as well.

The tests haven't confirmed it yet, but Trini Baker, a girl from my class at Memorial Middle School went missing a week ago.

Dad could see how upset I got, and decided to take me out to lunch at one of our favorite spots, a little Italian place that bakes their own sandwich bread and has the best espresso. Having him with me helped me feel safe. When we were back in the car on our way home, I asked him if he thought that they'd catch Mr. Rowden.

"You know what I do, right, Allie?"

"Yeah, you're a cop."

He smiled. A lot of guys he worked with didn't approve of the term. I said it as often as I could.

"Right. And I don't know if you remember, but the reason that we moved here was because I was offered a promotion to move here."

"Yeah. I remember."

"I don't usually talk about my work with you or your mom, but there's something that's been bothering me lately. One case in particular from when you were real little. I'm not saying they're related, either... Anyway, we got this call one night... Must have been about midnight, for a suicide -- a possible suicide, I mean. That's what the dispatch said. A neighbor called it in, saying that they'd heard a gunshot.

"Anyway, we get to the place, and it's this big two storey house up in the hills. You could just tell from the street that they had money.  Nice, maintained yard, two cars in the driveway and probably more in the garage. There wasn't a light on inside the house, though. The whole place was dark.

"We looked through the whole house, and didn't find anything. The place looked deserted. No food in the fridge, no clothes in the dresser or sheets on the bed. You'll see that sometimes, with suicides. People sell all their stuff. I guess they're trying to be less of a burden once they're gone, or whatever. We went from room to room, and I mean, if someone *was* living there, I don't know how they did it.

"I was the first to go into the basement. As soon as I opened the door, I could smell it. We called in the EMT's who were waiting outside. I went down to make sure that the scene was safe. There was a guy in the corner chained to the sink, and blood was everywhere. It covered half the floor. There wasn't a gun anywhere. Thing was, though, it was pretty obvious that he hadn't done it recently. He looked mummified -- well, that's not the right word for it -- decomposed, and like he was all dried out.

"It's sad. You know, it's upsetting when you come across something like that, I mean. You don't -- as a person, you don't stop feeling that way, no matter how many times you've seen it before. Somebody chained him there. Like a dog. He used to be a doctor. He had a family. But for a long time, he just sat there chained up in his basement. Long enough to want to take another way out. My partner and I pretty much got pushed off the case after forensics got there."

"I heard that that was how Mr. Rowden died, too," I said.

"Yeah. That's what I'm saying. That doctor that died? I saw him with my own eyes. He looked like he'd been dead for a long time. But people said that they'd seen him that same day at the hospital. Like he just pulled into the driveway, walked down to the basement and died. It didn't make sense.

"So then I hear about this Rowden guy now... and it doesn't match up either. I know you said you saw him at school that day... but the guy's been dead."

"I saw him. Dad, I really thought it was Mr. Rowden."

"I mean, did he act weird? Did he look different or anything?"

"No... not really. That's what's so strange about it. He was just boring, like a normal old guy. He mentioned Asbahr Lake, and opening a studio or something. I didn't think it was weird. I didn't think that anything was strange until later, after I found out..."

"Okay, hon. Sorry, you asked if I thought that they'd be able to find him. I think that if they don't find him quickly, that they may not be able to find him at all; or more precisely, that they'll be looking for the wrong person."

"What do you mean?"

"I think that this has happened before. I think it was that doctor. There are too many similarities to just be pure coincidence. And who knows if it's happened before that?"

He didn't tell me any more about it after that. Dad isn't a conspiracy theorist. He's logical. If I hadn't heard it myself, I wouldn't have believed that he believed any of it.

They still haven't found Mr. Rowden... or whoever. 

*Whatever*.

I'm starting to get sleepy... I think I'll try going to bed again.

Wish me luck, nosleep.

EDIT:

My friend Mike called, and he's in trouble.

He saw Bob Rowden talking to someone in the library. Mike didn't go to Memorial, but he recognized Mr. Rowden's picture from the articles on the internet -- the ones that said in no uncertain terms that Bob Rowden is dead.

Mike is a good friend. A good *person*. He's the type of person who would put his life on the line to help someone he doesn't even know. So he did. First, he called the police, then he walked over to the old man, grabbed him by the shoulder and wrenched him away from the girl he was talking to.

He said that Rowden hissed at him, like a feline. Little streams of spit flew from the man's mouth. The old man -- if it is in fact, human -- picked up the girl and ran down the the path between buildings with enough speed so that Mike, a pretty fit 20-year-old couldn't keep up with him. After a few turns, he'd lost track.

The police didn't believe a word. Instead of helping, they almost fined him for making a bogus emergency call, but they let him off with a warning.

Mike kept looking for traces of where the killer might have taken the girl. He believed that there was more time. That's just the way that Mike is. A helper.

He found them near the covered bridge at Oak Creek, where he followed the screams to find the girl, covered up to her neck in wet cement. He'd just gone down to the edge of the creek to help her when he was tackled from behind and knocked nearly unconscious.

What he saw then confirms everything. Mr. Rowden went up to the girl, bound and encased except for her head as though he were going to kiss her. The he opened his mouth wide, almost unhinging it like a snake's, and vomited something large into the girl's mouth, down her throat and inside her. Bile and slime ran down the poor girl's face, but he held her firmly in his liver spotted hands. Mike said that whatever it was that was "transferred," was moving. "Pulsating" is the word that he used. After that, Rowden finished casing her head in the thick cement, slowly suffocating her.

The whole time, Mike was powerless, unable to get up and do anything -- what could he have done against that kind of monster, anyway? He couldn't even escape as Bob Rowden set his sights on him next, slinging him over his shoulder and carrying him to where he had parked his old yellow truck and threw him into the bed.

At a stoplight, Mike was able to get away and jump onto a city bus which took him back to campus. As soon as he could, he called the police again. He tried to avoid telling them what he'd actually seen, instead just urging them to go to the covered bridge.

The police didn't find anything there. They showed up at his apartment a half hour later and arrested him under some trumped up bullshit charge. They can't hold him for long... but Mr. Rowden now knows who he is. He should be running.

I'm driving straight through the night, it's 20 hours. I should be back in Oregon tomorrow. I only hope that I can get there in time. 




 /r/thetruthishere is supposed to have true stuff as well. 




 Right? Gosh.

Sorry I annoyed you with my question posed in the appropriate subreddit. "No," might have sufficed. 




 How did you get downvoted? You basically said reading more will teach you about how to write. 




 I vote for the second one as well. 




 Confined to a bed for the majority of the day and unable to even make it to the bathroom before I piss myself, theres not much left in this life worth holding onto.

This line doesn't quite fit. If he's really so far gone, it just doesn't make sense that he'd try to write out this story for reddit. It makes me want to have it framed as a dictation or a found journal or something else.

Wish I had more for you! Good luck with your story. 




 Alan Goodtime is behind it! 




 Completely ignore the fact that she plays basketball as her primary sport. And that DoSomething.org is about inspiring kids to get off their asses, not equivalent to a full ride scholarship to play a football. She probably sent in a video that DoSomething can use in their commercials. 




 Story?! This is a man's life on the line! 




 I saw him. It was exact. 




 I attended Memorial for two years before my family and I moved to Colorado in 2006. I moved back into the area to attend the state college that's a few miles down the road. Maybe it's not as strange as I thought, but I was surprised at how many people I still recognized despite the long gap of time.

Mr. Rowden was the art teacher when I went to school there. I never took an art class, and I couldn't tell you much about him except that he was the oldest teacher I'd seen at the time. His back was hunched over, and he wore those old-people shoes with the velcro straps. In the bustling halls, I sometimes worried that the kids would knock him over. He seemed frail like that.

I never talked to any of my old classmates, and keep in mind, I hadn't so much as thought about Mr. Rowden in seven years. And then he showed up to my Intro to Psychology lecture this term.

Psychology is one of those Gen. Ed. classes that most students have to take at one time or another. Consequently, it's taught in one of the largest lecture halls on campus, complete with a stage and an upper level of seats. I showed up late and snuck up to the balcony hoping to avoid notice. I apparently wasn't the only one with the same idea because most of the seats were full. In fact, I almost left, figuring that I could read the syllabus myself later. Then I saw Mr. Rowden patting the empty seat behind him all the way in the back. He was still wearing the same off-white button up shirt, worn thin enough to see through, and brown flowing slacks. His hair was mostly gone, and its place on his scalp had been taken replaced with brown spots. His smile was tainted by a tooth that had died and turned brown. It was like something out of a dream.

I sat next to him, though. And despite the oddity of him being there in the first place (he said that he was auditing classes, not attending them as a student), the rest of the lecture went pretty normally. Except that he would not shut up. He kept talking about how he was retired now, and so glad to be out of the teaching game. He was building an art studio "out on Asbar Lake" which I had never heard of. There are hundreds of lakes in the area, most aren't even named, or have more than one depending on who you ask. He talked about how the old art supply store had gone out of business when a chain had come in. Between the ramblings of a lonely old man and the "Hi, my name is" first day of class spiel, I was exploring new depths of boredom. Thankfully it only lasted an hour and a half. I didn't see Mr. Rowden in my lectures anymore, though I looked for him just so I could try to avoid sitting by him again. 

I met up with some friends that that weekend and mentioned that I'd seen my old art teacher. Mike, who's lived here his whole life instantly thought that it was strange. He said that he'd heard of a teacher named Rowden getting arrested a few years ago. It was big news at the time, involving a kidnapping and a police investigation. His parents even got so worried about it that they'd tried to keep him home at night. I hadn't heard anything about this from Colorado, and at first I thought that he must have been mistaken. My other friends teased me for getting hit on by the creepy teacher, and thought that it was pretty funny. I felt weird about it. I started to wonder how he even recognized me now. In 7th grade, I'd been a chubby girl with glasses, and I hadn't even been in his class.

Google didn't turn up anything about Mr. Rowden or Asbar Lake. I told myself that it was probably nothing, just Mike mixing up some rumors he'd heard from his parents.

I was walking back to my car from the library at about 9:00 at night when an old brown pickup drove up beside me. Just as I looked up to see what they wanted a bulb flashed and blinded me, then the truck sped down the street and out of sight.

I was nervous before, but now I was scared. I called Mike, just so that someone would know where I was. He was really reassuring, and told me that it was probably just some asshole college kid, and that I shouldn't be worried about something that happened years ago in the next town. By the time I reached my car I was feeling better. I said goodbye to Mike and drove to the gas station, then to my apartment.

The same car followed me both times. I could tell because they were missing a headlight. They even followed me in a circle around the block. I should have called the cops then, but Mike's number was still up on my speed dial. He probably couldn't understand a word I said, because the truck following me rammed into my bumper and I started shouting. I floored it, and then Mike picked up. I told him I was crossing the bridge out of town and that someone was chasing me.

That's the last thing I remember before waking up in an ambulance. My parents came. Someone ran into the back of my car while I was on the bridge. My car fishtailed and went through the railing, dropped thirty five feet and sunk into the muddy bank of the river. Mike called 911 and told them where to find me. It didn't take them long to get there, but they found me out of the car, laying on my back. Footprints led to and from the vehicle, but no one else was around. They still haven't found the truck that followed me and almost killed me.

Mike came and visited me in the hospital. He said that was sorry, and that he should have stayed on the phone with me. Then, he said that there was something that he needed to show me.

Mr. Rowden died in 2011. His body was found chained and gagged in the basement art studio of his home months after his death. No one had reported him missing or dead... because he hadn't stopped teaching. Six students of Memorial Middle School disappeared that same year, and it was only when they went to interview the art teacher at his house that they found what had really happened to him.

Someone had been dressing up as Mr. Rowden and impersonating him. That was all that they knew until almost a year later, when a summer drought dried up a small, unnamed lake, revealing six cement figurines posed in various ways. Inside the suspicious cement figures were the bodies of the missing students.

I saw him. Bob Rowden is back. It's not a person dressed in a disguise, but neither is it the real Bob Rowden. It's something else. Don't listen to it.

UPDATE: They found a body in Asbahr Lake. A cement statue that looks like it's been painted. I'm going to my parents' house in Colorado.

 I hope the next pair of glasses didn't have any side effects... 




 I'm not sure how you think that way as a writer, or get confident enough to try and write that story. This is why /u/deadnspread is so good. His writing is fearless. He even invented a villain, and made you understand them, too. Crazy. 




 It kind of starts from the end, then goes back and breaks your heart. Damn. 




 Just reading that made you hungry? 




 Careful, OP. I know you're looking for other kids who went to school there, but the last time anyone started asking questions about Warwood, it wasn't a student that responded.  




 This happened to me the other day! There I was, reading along, and then 




 You're a big guy. 




 Has the involvement of the masked man, Bane, been ruled out?

The night after I arrived in the city, there was a sound like the earth tearing in half. To the east, it looked like a volcano had erupted in the middle of downtown. Dirt, rocks, debris and ash fell in the streets while I took shelter in a nearby office building. The image of furious red and yellow fire was burnt into my eyes. The sound didn't stop, either. A terrible shrieking continued long after the explosion.

In a few hours, the ash had settled. It looked soft in the dim light, like the black streets had grown fur. The unique muffled quiet of freshly fallen snow set a hush over everything. With a damp towel wrapped over my mouth and nose, I made my way closer to the impact zone.

Still a few blocks from the destruction, I thought I'd seen shadowy figures moving in and out of the buildings, and darting into alleyways, always staying just out of view. At last, I came upon the crater, but it wasn't like I'd expected. Instead of a jagged edge and broken ground, the edge looked to have been precisely cut. I even felt it with my hand, and the edge of the asphalt was smooth as glass. The crater itself was approximately 100 feet across, and the side furthest away from me was still burning. That side looked like the ground had been torn or blown apart. In the center, at the bottom of the egg-shaped hole was a machine. I didn't have time to get a good look at it.

From behind me, I heard a scuffling. Bugs. A half dozen of them, closing in around me with lightning speed. I didn't stand a chance, but along with them stepped a man. With a word from him, the bugs stopped. Completely motionless. Normally, when you see a bug, their antennae moves, their mandibles absently open and close, the wiry hair along their exoshells wave up and down. These bugs did not.

The man was wearing suit that looked like it was made of liquid metal. I recognized it immediately from the news holograms, it was the type of clothing that the colonists wore on the moon.

He was supposed to explain everything once we got to the moon -- that was what that machine was for in the center of the crater, a transporter. Something had gone wrong when he'd come here because there usually wasn't any type of fire or explosion. Maybe it was damaged or... well, I don't know.

I couldn't have gone to the moon.

For about a minute, the transporter whirred and the energy built. It felt like a long time, just waiting, holding onto the metallic handles. Then everything outside the sphere shifted, the colors ran like a fresh painting sprayed with a water hose. There was a sensation of movement, without inertia, as if travelling in every direction at once. I'd never felt so sick.

When the horrible spinning finally stopped, I found myself in a wide open field full of dry, dead grass, which I promptly vomited onto. As the machine wound down, more of my surroundings were revealed a little at a time. On the edge of the horizon was a collection of ramshackle buildings. When the machine finally fell silent, I went to find out where I was.

The people here don't speak English, or any of the other languages programmed into my watch's translator. Their society exists without technology at all for the most part. These factors, when considered together lead me to believe that I may not be on Earth any longer. I've gotten along with them so far, but even after 4 days, I haven't been able to communicate with them, or to work the machine to get myself out of here.

Something tried to sneak into the village late last night, and after a commotion, I walked out to find a carcass lopped into several pieces by a giant of a man holding a wicked-looking battle axe. A bug.  They're here as well., and judging by their reaction, they have been for quite some time. 




 *I* am the one who coughs. 




 "... and it runs on three AAA batteries."

So it's rechargable if you buy rechargable batteries for it? 




 I subbed because of /r/Serendipity's random feature of a post. Awesome idea for a subreddit!

 Mwahahaha! 




 A lot of sources say that 30% is a good goal for things to be cut in editing. If you've got "I this," then "I that," and "I went," consider cutting one of those sentences.

I like this solution much better in most cases than adding unecessary language to say something simple.

But really, we don't need to know every place you looked. 




 It was I!

 [365 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2r5p41/365_days/) [364 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2rahc6/364_days/)

The cities were drained of people when the extraterrestrials enslaved us. Being crammed in so tightly inevitably creates redundancies. Cities are inefficient. Instead, an optimal size was determined, and the population was then spread into these communities, leaving the once-thriving metropolises behind, nothing but empty, colorless husks.

I made it. Cold, hungry and tired, I stepped over the police tape and navigated the cement barricades across the road. Banners reading "Happy Holidays!" were still draped along some of the buildings. Things had changed so fast.

A year later, I was back home. It felt a little like opening the door expecting to see your wife there, when really they've gone to the store, or had to stay late at work. There's no welcome. The air is still and empty of life.

Regrettably, that was the extent of my plane: to escape -- at least to try -- I honestly never thought that I'd make it this far. Once inside the empty city, my goals accomplished, it struck me as very wrong to just wait to be found. Just waiting to die.

My stomach grumbled. I needed food. I started going toward the supermarket on Kings, but decided that the 7-Eleven on Noble would be better, since it accepted energy tips. I got to the 7-Eleven and inserted my watch in the receptacle. The lights in the front of the store flickered to life. A Muzak track even started playing from the place it had left off. I gave three energy tips, enough to last a few minutes while I did my shopping.

Power management had changed a lot in my lifetime. Environmentally conscious consumers had begged for ways to reduce our reliance on pollutant power plants while developers pushed back against space hungry wind and solar options. Wave power, using the back and forth movement of the ocean progressed the most. The components required were eventually shrunk to the point that a person could wear a band around their ankle or wrist and through the course of their normal day they'd generate enough power to power the lights in their home, or run their hologram projectors. A boom in health movements coincided and gadget manufacturers, especially watchmakers like myself, put the pieces together. You plug your watch into the treadmill for your morning run or purchase a pair of power-generating Nikes, or even moving the watch itself and you become the battery for your own life.

But it was all a novelty until battery technology opened the door to change. Previously unused materials enabled charged batteries to "stack" like building blocks. A battery would reach its traditional capacity, then those charged chemicals would realign, separating themselves into a very small threads and leaving the rest of the battery available to charge again at 99.99% of its original capacity. The process could be repeated thousands of times within a single battery, and so the concept of having a full battery was made obsolete. How you spent your power was made akin to how you spent your money. Your watch became your wallet. And so some businesses decided to get in on it. They installed "energy tip" receptacles. The reasoning being that if you wanted lights while you shopped, that you should literally have to be responsible to do the legwork to turn them on. If no one patronized a store, then the power would run out. The public generated their energy for free, and also generated it for the places that they liked to go things they wanted to do.

Power plants and city grids didn't cease to exist, but they were in the process of being phased out. Hence why the 7-Eleven on Noble could be powered by a simple swipe of my watch.

The sensation of picking whatever I wanted off the shelves was so familiar, and yet alien at the same time. This was the first time in over a year that I'd been allowed to pick whatever I wanted -- even if it was just the stuff containing industrial-strength preservatives. Surprisingly, hot dogs still turned in the rollers, looking just a shade paler and older than if the store had never closed.

I opened a bag of Twinkies, and then one of cookies. After eating nothing but bland, nutritionally balanced mush for a year, my taste buds lit up like the Fourth of July. Salty chips, sweet candy and frothy carbonated soda brought me to flavor ecstasy. 

In my revelry, I lost track of time and my surroundings and the power ran out. The store was plunged into darkness. The Slurpee machines stopped turning, the Muzak stopped playing and every light in the place went out. Every light but one. From the hallway that led through a pair of double doors to the stockroom, a green light was pulsing, casting a shadow onto the ceiling. A head, shoulders -- *a man*, standing. Watching.

I knelt down behind the shelves and the bag of Cheetos in my hand crinkled loudly. Whoever it was had to know that I was there.

A sliding, dragging sound came from the entrance to the stockroom, inching closer across the dusty tiles.

*A man. A man? A drifter? Another runaway? Was he looking for me? Did he live here?*

The pulsing green light illuminated him against the ceiling, just a few feet away from me now. I cursed myself for being so careless, for not planning my escape, for not finding a weapon.

The dragging sound was rounding the end of the shelf. Green light shined in my eyes. I sprung from my crouch, and ran toward them, slamming into the stranger's broad, armored chest and knocking them backward into the glass doors and into the section of rotten frozen food. The smell was horrendous.

I wailed away with my fists, but every blow struck an armored surface -- a helmet, a chestplate, even its arms were covered in thick metal. They weren't fighting back.

*Deee-e-e-eeeeeeear sssiiiii-iii-i-i-iiirr.*

I stood back and wiped splattered curdled ice cream from my eyes. Wheels spun and whirled, sticking through the glass display case where the attacker's legs should have been. Under rank hot pockets and frozen pizza boxes, the voice came again.

"Deeear sir or madam. Tha-ank you for removing yourself. It seems that I've suffered some damage due to this accident, and my sensors are not working. Cou-u-ld you please help me up, and tell me whether I'm in a safe place to run my diagnostics?"

A fucking robot. A marketing gimmick by city's department of tourism, they'd designed dozens of the droids to wander the city's downtown, giving directions and advertising various businesses, places to shop or ongoing events for the day. They were shaped like a man, a holographic face projected above a pair of shoulders and torso painted to look like a butler's suit.

Unbelieveable.

The broken butler did help me find a safe place to stay during the day. He says that the last interaction that he's had with people or the bugs was 363 days ago, so I figure that for the time being I'm still alone. I wonder how long it will be before they come here looking for me?

 Our [universe is a computer simulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)? And the whole thing's lubed up with KY jelly? Awesome story. 




 Yes, definitely. Have you thought of using a program for it? [This one](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest) was pretty easy to use. 




 It's alive! Yes! 




 I'll keep updating as long as I can. I've got to say though... even a few seconds of living my own life is better than living without choice.
