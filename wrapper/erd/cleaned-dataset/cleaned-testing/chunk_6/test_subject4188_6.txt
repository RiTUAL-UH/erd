 Yeah she was a sex siren who screamed like one 




 Are there any plans confirmed for the area front facing the taxis

The bit of land in front between the car park and the fountain path

Heard there was plans for this as well as the old Nelson Mandela site

They need to have a Sheffield store / gift shops and a few restaurants 




 So many epic lines in this scenes, never rub another man's rhubarb 









 Yeah agree, it seemed very rushed and the panel all seemed on edge

Sometimes these organisers should give set times for these things

Like at least 50 minutes per show / panel to have 20 minutes talk then the rest questions 




 Well, Mulder and Scully finally got together in the second film so will that play differently now we have six new episodes to view soon?

One of the things that drived the series was the sexual tension / chemistry between them, the will it or won't it happen every week, it's what kept us coming back for more

So with this no longer an issue, will there still be a spark between them that will produce great scenes, maybe they could add more humour to compensate like a lover's tiff kind of banter between them, that would be entertaining 




 Yeah me too but it's an odd character to get behind anyway, think early in the season she should have had interests to follow, I heard she was an attorney or something

It would be great if she pursued some job like that and stirs things up in GCPD for Gordon then at night the claws come out and she has an alternate life 




 Going on the recent Comic Con panel, I get the impression that she feels like a black sheep on there, not getting any notice and given garbage material to work with

Bruno Heller and the writers not giving her any real respect and other actors all getting the star treatment, I feel really bad for the actress

She can obviously act and am sure given enough scenes she would shine, she is a lot more interesting than Morena Baccarin in a non ego kind of way, like more open and willing to speak to people

She should be given more meat to chew on, more things to grasp, it seems the writers are embarrassed how they have written her into a corner and seemed like they made a mistake with her at the beginning and are wishing the character away so are choosing an easy way out by making her psychotic 




 Come on Riddler, put more effort in FFS 




 Was that Jerome at the end, WTF ??? 




 Do we have a full version? 




 Batboy stay away from Penguin !!!
