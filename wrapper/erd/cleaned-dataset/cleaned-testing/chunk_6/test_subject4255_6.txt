 It's nuts!! I think about stupid ideas that are similar all the time!  




 Me too. I pick my ears and smell the wax. I scratch my scalp and sniff. I'm fucking weird.  




 I've never heard of that! 




 Yeah, it's definitely weird. It's totally normal though.  

I just wonder what the biological reason for them are? 




 Do you ever think about jerking your wheel into oncoming traffic?  




 Having fun isn't hard when you have a library card. 




 You're awesome! Thank you! 




 I know what I'm about to plug gets plugged a lot but just in case *you* didn't know:

/r/intrusivethoughts 




 I guess I'm not almost dead then. I don't know what the fuck to do with my life. I'm almost 25... 




 Where are you playing it? I miss old runescape!  




 I understand that "non-fiction" = "real" but come one! "Non" is confusing! I never got it right in grade school.

It's just like **pro**hibited 

 




 Yeah, but some are full of more shit than others.  




 Exactly. Reddit is a fan of progressivism.  




 Got it on my second game of the day, thanks Lucky!!! 




 You mainly see reddit criticize Republicans because of the policies they try to push through. One thing a lot of redditors stand behind (regardless of political affiliation) is net neutrality. Guess which party is strongly against it?  




 No OP! Now I'm on a How it's Made binge trip!!!   

:) 




 DOWN WITH THE SUBTITLES!!!! ARGGHH! 




 YOU'RE THE MAN NOW DAWG YOU'RE THE MAN NOW DAWG YOU'RE THE MAN NOW DAWG* 




 Wait... Are you saying old school runescape is free to play!? 




 inb4 "why r u so quiet?"  




 I live in Texas, the place blows. 




 specially  




 WoW* you pleb.  

Imma friendzone u.  




 I like these better when they use classic rap songs. Not this IDFWU bullshit.  




 All aboard the trickle-down train. 

 




 I'm okay with that. 




 You're not wrong. It's pretty stupid.  




 $50,112.80

Fucking crazy. 




 I could not agree more!  




 The actual location has been torn down, this is a replica.  




 Just in case anyone wanted to know, he won $100. 




 Cuz it funks your brother 




 "You lil dumbass bitch I ain't fucking with youuuuu."

Man, he deserves a Grammy.  




 I can completely understand that. Thank you for your response. 

No one wants to dance to a bonerkill song that has meaning. Not even I. I want stuff that will make me hop. I get it now.  




 Put your money where your mouth is.

I feel like you just wanted to use this phrase even though its context isn't appropriate to this situation.  




 ayyyy lmao 




 Thank you, I forget that it's not about meaning. It's about hits.  




 How did this come about?  

[I don't know. I have not received a phone call from anyone at Miramax. I got a phone call from my agent saying that Harvey was pulling out, didn't want to make the movie. I just wanna know what the hell happened but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with young (Meryl Poster?) who's not my biggest fan. **Man, that fucking cunt from Miramax doesn't like me. As a matter of fact she doesn't like me at all. She considers me a boozing, womanizing, asshole that never deserved this in the first place...**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Ujf9Qp66M t=1800)

Yeah, no fucking kidding you douche.  




 How do shit songs like IDFWU get such a huge hype? The song is the same shit over and over, it lacks creativity, it's TERRIBLE.  




 Woah 




 For $1k? I'd better be full. 




 I know right? $1k for a meal... That's a poor man's food budget for a couple of months.  




 Lifestyles of the rich in a nutshell.  




 Jesus people, he/she's just asking a question. No need to downvote him/her. 




 Sounds like a lot of work for a meal. 




 It's okay! I guarantee you OP is up there on socioeconomic scale.  




 Except, does it tell time? 




 ah shit, I thought we were in agreement that it was "Berenstain"

Now that I think about it, that's not what we agreed upon, my bad. 




 It was misleading because you don't opt out of your HIPAA rights with the care card, you opt out with their express prescription program.  




 I'll probably do glycemic load once I reach my target weight. Their will be carbs but they are better for you. 




 Bird up. 




 The restaurant doesn't happen to be Pho Pasteur in Arlingtion, TX does it?  




 The clock is so accurate that if you built another one the two would never sync because of the different amounts of gravity around the earth, even when they are on top of each other or next to each other. 




 Indeed, thanks for pointing that out.  




 I never liked that guy. He always seemed like a douche. 




 Sweetening drinks/baked goods? 




 No shit!? What store? Maybe I can find one near me. 




 Thing is, they are so expensive!  




 Could you recommend a brand of carbless sweetener?  




 What do you use instead?
 




 It's found in a wide variety of powdered artificial sweeteners, from stevia to splenda. It's a starch and the ratio in stevia, splenda, is 1:1 so a 550 serving [bag of stevia](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91hm25DmYML._SL1500_.jpg) will have 550g of carbs from maltodextrin. 

I know 1g carb per 1 tablespoon isn't a bad amount of carbs but I was startled when a friend of mine did the research. 

Anyhow, what do you think? 




 Let's cut the evil before we become LoL 









 This dress is a cancer that's infecting all my subs!!!!

 [kek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y4LdvAi05s) 




 I think OP's video is a fake. It's audio dubbed over a mini clip.  




 It's the former. OP added the audio in. Notice how it's a very brief viewing of her 'reaction' and you can't see Sway's face. OP is a phony.  




 Yeah, president Obama's request to ensure net neutrality had *nothing* to do with this decision.

/s

Thank Obama for listening to the people. Thank him for representing our interests. 

Edit: We can also thank the populace for voting for Obama in 2012. I can't imagine how this decision would have turned out if Romney was elected. The majority of republicans were/are against net neutrality.  




 Yes, please smoke underage so that the opposition can use you as a catalyst for their cause. 

/s 




 Jerk it bro 




 I'm not a fan of Depp.  




 Hahahaha. Hell fucking no. 




 One day I'll be able to cash my karma in. In a post-apocalyptic internet world. 




 TIL that I like one of Burton's films.  




 What is asymmetrical gameplay? Is that when you're all working towards one goal? 

Ah wait, he just said it. 




 That was crap. 









 Man, he sucks.  




  Looks like every soccer game ~~in the world cup~~

*FTFY* 




 It is.  

You usually pay for shipping and handling on the items.  

Big companies like Kraft, etc. will donate TONS of food to these regional food banks.  

You'll pay like $1.50 for a case of peanut butter or like $.32/lb for chicken.    




 It's not like I never believed Dubai *didn't* have poor people but I've never seen a picture that outlines the other side.

This is the first time I've been exposed to poverty of Dubai. I think that's what makes this picture unique and appreciated. 




 I ordered a pizza last night and I noticed on my receipt there was a "delivery fee" of like $2.  

Does that go to the driver? Should I calculate my tip based on that amount?    

Anyway, I still tipped the delivery driver $5 but I was just curious.    




 Here's the plot summary for anyone unable to watch it on YouTube:   



http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last#Plot_summary   


It's a great episode.  




 It sucks it always comes off dickish. 

I just wanted to help out, he could be a non-native speaker.  




 Just to let you know:

I fucking hate Dr. Who AND 'How I met your mother'

The former is a cheap-ass show where every supporting actor fucking sucks at their job and the special effects are lame.

The latter because it's just not funny. Canned laughs all over the place and Ted is a fucking moronic character  




 The redditor that uses 'cause' in place of 'because'

They're two different fucking words.  




 I can't find any "Sugar Tax" in the article.  




 An* 









  Nice pic. It's hard for me to picture water not spraying out from the gap between my legs or between the seat and the butt crack

Oh, I need to answer this. You can adjust the position of the nozzle to get the perfect shot at your keester. 

Also, I'd recommend buying a foot stool. If you put your feet on it while pooping, your body will form the natural position for pooping. This gets the poop out easier and is easier on your colon. It's way more comfortable too.  




 There are some on Amazon that you can get for under $30. Don't pay more than $30.  




 I'd like to pursue comedy too. I can make people laugh pretty easily.

I'm currently seeking employment in a bigger city. One that has comedy clubs.  

You should do the same, try comedy out at a club. It's not just great for showing you if you're truly interested but it can help refine your talent.

 Masturbation.  




 Logic's really upfront with his influences, which is a lot better than jocking the style without giving props

Oh, and that is one thing I appreciate about him. He seems very grateful of the inspiration previous artists have gave him.  




 I completely agree. It works in Midnight Marauders (I'm currently listening to that album) but it absolutely does not in Under Pressure.  




 I sleep on my back with my feet straight up.  




 I cannot understand why Logic chose to audio morph these endings. 

I appreciate learning about different anecdotes about him and the creation of the album but I just cannot understand why he made them all choppy and weird. It really kills the flow of the album, IMO. 

Here's some samples of what I'm talking about in case you haven't listened to the album:

['Metropolis' outro](http://youtu.be/4bdMtenCBjc?t=4m42s)  

['Buried Alive' outro](http://youtu.be/tqJ24z5ys4U?t=5m17s)

['Bounce' outro](http://youtu.be/ENDuSctl8h4?t=3m45s)

ETC.

I really love the album, I think the beats and lyrics are awesome. I just don't get it.  




 I'm good at drawing shit. 




 With a crane.  




 Would you like me to draw you a picture?

Edit: [here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/Xe9c6VW.png) 




 Or just buy a bidet and stop wasting paper.  




  cannon

That's a big fucking cannon.  




 Am I the only one who read the subtitle?  




 Thank you! That was perfect!

 At least you submitted some OC. I can't bitch about that.

 I'm not sure why you and I are being downvoted...  




 What the shrek did you just shreking say about me, you little puss-in-boots? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Shreks, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on fairytale creatures, and I have over 300 confirmed layers. I am trained in donkeh warfare and I'm the top shreker in the entire Duloc armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will shrek you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this swamp, mark my shreking words. You think you can get away with coming into my swamp? Think again, mothershreker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ogres across Duloc and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, swamp maggot. The storm that shreks out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking shreked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can shrek you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare ear tube antenna things. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed shrekage, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ogre Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to shrek your miserable ass off the face of my swamp, you little long-nosed puppet. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your shreking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn trespasser. I will shrek fury all over you and you will drown in in the mud of my swamp. You're shreking shreked, kiddo.

Edit 1: Gold? Thanks m'lady.  




 So you mean /r/outside? 




 Try keto. Limit carbs and then exercise.

 ITT: KNEE ISSUE?

It's been answered folks. Ctrl+F

My questions: 

Did you have any conversations with Trebec? Is he pleasant?  




 Coitos you elaborate more about the eggnog?  




 DOWN WITH THE CAPTIONS! 




 Downward wipe? Isn't that bad for the vag? 









 Don't do it man! The only great actors are the main characters and it has dull special effects.  

Edit: it's literally the worst show available.  




 I appreciate your input!

 Sax guy saves the day. 




 If Anonymous did this I would be so glad. 




 When that 70 year old man dies, so will his prejudices. 




 I did notice a subtle change.

Berenstein became Berenstain. 




 Doing your mom. 




 You mean /r/food? 




 Dip yourself in hot sauce every morning. Dogs hate hot sauce.  




 Not all liberal arts degree holders are like that. Pls don't group me.  




 The average amount of debt for my class at my private school was like $23k. Divide that by 4 and the average yearly cost was $5,750 a year.

 




 Yeah, and all these 'engineers' bitching about 'LE LIBRAL ARTS R BAD'  

The school I went to had so many graduates move on to medical school and other degree programs. My school was/is notorious for getting graduates out in four years. There were/are plenty of undergraduate research opportunities available. I could go on.  

Sure, they're not meant for everyone but neither is higher education.  

I'd say it was well worth the 10k a year I paid.
