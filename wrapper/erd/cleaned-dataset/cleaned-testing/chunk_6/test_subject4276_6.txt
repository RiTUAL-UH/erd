 Yeah but now it's basketball season, and then it will be baseball season, and then there's constantly soccer... And hockey fits in there somewhere. And then every 2 years there's either summer or winter Olympics. What I'm saying is, there really isn't any peace for those of us who have no interest in sports 




 My wife doesn't wear her ring because her fingers got bigger and neither of us really want to pay to resize it. That's ~$300 that could go towards feeding our son 




 My wife and I would play two headed giant but both of us on separate teams. It's like being a swinger without having to have someone else's dick all up in there  




 I used to be subscribed there but it isn't as fun when it's just a bunch of people posting mildly uninteresting photos of their relatives and expecting someone to photos hop it into something hilarious. It's far more funny when stuff like this happens organically without any provocation  




 What are his best written sketches?  




 That psychologist sounds like he's full of shit. My wife was diagnosed by a psychiatrist and usually for the first session he schedules a 75 minute questionnaire so he can figure out the first steps of treatment for whatever he may think you might be. They ended up with a 3 hour long session because he wanted to know everything that was going on and felt very confident on bipolar 1 by the end of it.  




 It should also be noted how ridiculously expensive it is. Not for those with no or poor insurance coverage. If I didn't have insurance, a 30 day supply would have been $1600 




 Yeah we're setting up our bedroom to be a private space nobody is allowed to be in since it's pretty big. We don't have any private space in the common area because her grandmother comes up from her basement area anytime someone is in the common area. Currently looking for a TV and wall mount for our bedroom for us to watch movies and play video games and spend time together alone  




 I love you guys and that you're being as open as you are. There's only one thing that bothered me and I'm sure a lot of other people about jc2 that I'd like for you to avoid with jc3: retailer-specific pre-order perks. I don't mind pre-ordering games but I don't like that I have to choose which one to do it in order to get some specific item, especially if not all those stores are available to me 




 Her very first visit with her therapist they determined she was codependent. She got a book called codependent no more and has been working on it and for a while it got a lot better but then there were life situations that made it rear its ugly head again. Basically we're living in the same place as her grandmother, who was the one that raised her, and is incredibly codependent in addition to a myriad of mental health problems that she refuses to get help for because she says "she's beyond help"  but she also just views mental problems as beneath her. 

Anyway, my brother in law lost his job and moved back into state and we let him move in with us until he gets a job and his own place but for now it's nice having him around because he helps around the house and occasionally watches our 7 month old son. However, the problem is it multiplied her grandmother's codependency and the wife has been in a prolonged mixed state/episode (we've discovered hers last for a really long time, looking back after the diagnosis and subsequent psychiatric visits) so she's leeching the codependency. Then after that, my other brother in law who is only 17 suddenly flew up here because he wanted to connect with his biological dad who he never really knew and again, further intensified the grandmother's codependency. 

We're doing our best to work on the codependency and unfortunately we're not really in a place to permanently fix the problem  




 Thanks I didn't know about that subreddit  




 My post was just as choppy. Just weird stream of consciousness. Thanks for the candid advice, I really appreciate it. Since you are in a relationship, have you done any couples therapy? We haven't been at it long, but it has been really awesome so far, especially with building a toolset on how to support each other. We're doing imago therapy which is more than just going to a therapist and just talking to the therapist about how we feel. The therapist is there to just give ideas and prompt conversation with the two of us and help us along. It sounds like you guys have it together but it's something I think can be helpful to a lot of couples even without problems  




 I started reading a book called "Loving someone with bipolar disorder". 

I don't know what I'm doing like at all. She's been going to a therapist for months, and we both go to the same one for couple's therapy. She's a great therapist and I'm glad we found her. It's actually a really funny story how my wife found her. She had made a therapist appointment and actually ended up at the wrong place in the same building complex. By some weird stroke of fate, the therapist had someone with the same first name cancel an appointment at the same time. 

Last month she recommended a psychiatrist to her and he got her into a question session to find more out about her and diagnosed her with bipolar, and put her on a slow titration of lamictol, which she had taken in the past and worked well for her. 

He also gave her something for her anxiety which didn't seem to work. Made her irritable for half the day because she had to take it before bed to help her sleep.  Now he put her on something newer, I guess called latuda and she only just got that yesterday. I can't believe how expensive that shit is. A 30 day supply was $1600,and my insurance required doctor authorization before they'd pay for it. Thank God they did because that helped a LOT. 

I'm just talking and rambling, sorry. Those of you in relationships, what do you want/need from your SO, and for those of you who aren't what would you want? 




 Wife stopped smoking since being diagnosed with bipolar and found it has been causing rapid cycling, even when she used hard-core put you on your ass asleep stuff. She'd be real upset the day after. Any other random stuff would bring manic episodes  




 Do baddies follow you through a wormhole?  




 I'm finding that farming does nothing but clutter my chests and ice boxes. It's so random what you get and doesn't seem worth it for now few and far between dragon fruits are. I'm fine with having a bunch of berry bushes to use as filler for my meatballs and that way I only ever need a few food ingredients.  




 What's a good way to restore sanity? I made a bunch of nets to catch butterflies and plant flowers but I just hit my second winter and don't feel like I have enough to last the winter. I spent a lot of time just standing near my fire to get sanity  




 I know about kiting and all that but I can't seem to do that when I have 5 hounds chasing me I don't seem to fare so well. The last two times I had hounds they happened at night so I didn't have anywhere I could really go and ended up running around my camp fire until dawn so I could run towards the pig houses which are also next to spider nests in order for them to have them fight each other. The last attack I barely survived by the skin of my neck and was going insane by the end of it. 

I was able to make 5 tooth traps after the last attack but I fear that won't be enough. There's a beefalo herd through a wormhole right by my base but I don't know if I want to take a sanity hit right before or during a hound attack. What I'm most worried about though is night attacks 




 I'm not sure but I've never had to kill more than 4-5 each day and by the time I kill more my naughtiness is reset again 




 I disagree on rabbit farming. My home is next to a bunch of rabbit holes and granted I'm only 40 or so days in, I've survived almost exclusively on meatballs made from rabbits and whatever filler I find and an occasional meat stew when I happen  to have actual meat. I have 30+ rabbits at any given time in my chests and can go out and collect about 2 days worth of food any time I go to the traps 




 ITT: tons of movies I've  never  seen  




 The article didn't really seem to explain very well, but what it looks like is Samsung is inserting ads into apps ran on the smart TV itself. If you are using an external device to watch something you should be fine.  




 How were you watching it? Was it through an app installed on the TV itself or was the hard drive connected to a computer that was connected via HDMI?  




 When I was a kid my mom made lunches for me every day except maybe once a week she would let me have a hot lunch at school for something I really liked on the menu or a special occasion. Back then I wished I could eat the school lunches more but looking back I'm glad she did it that way and I'll continue that with my family  




 Don't buy this game, it will consume your free time  




 The console bit wasn't directed at you personal, I'm honestly just wondering because it seems lame that they wouldn't be able to see their status. 

I can see where smarter crock pot is good to use because honestly, I'm either going to look at the wiki or use the crockpot simulator app on my phone for recipes. 

What does the non deployable mod do?  




 I think the minimap is great, and actually could could make things slightly more difficult while seeming to make it easier. Think about it. You're running around and then press the map button. The game is paused while you stare at the map and see where you need to go. But with the minimap, you glance up at that but don't pause the game. It's almost an unnoticeable amount of time but time still passes where it wouldn't have looking at the regular map.  




 As I said below, I play from the couch and use a controller so I can't over over my health or hunger or whatever. How has this been dealt with on the ps4 version? Do console players just get to miss out on ever seeing actual numbers?  




 I'd love this functionality. Having to craft a farm and then use the farm in another recipe to make an advanced farm but if you placed the farm already you should be able to add the required materials to the placed farm to upgrade it.  




 Don't forget additional structures. Made by the same guy and balanced just as well. Doesn't add anything ridiculous that doesn't seem like it wouldn't belong in the game.  




 I use always on status because I use a controller and thus cannot hover over anything with my mouse. 

In addition to that, I have a mod called additional structures. It adds some bigger and metal chests that I feel fit the balance of the game well. I also have craft able tunnels which I have yet to use. 

I would say anything that is cheating would be stuff that increases your stack sizes, or something that adds a backpack slot. I know that I should be able to wear a damn backpack with a coat but that's not how the game was designed/balanced.  




 Are there any plans to progress this game beyond small scenarios? Like being open world and actually creating your own castle and raiding other people's castles? The game is in what, alpha? And it's already so beautiful. It would be a shame to be limited to small scenarios  




 Alternatively there's a chrome extension  




 I personally like meatballs. Honey nuggets are good too if you have bee boxes. I just finished my first winter and I basically ate nothing but meatballs using rabbits save for the couple times I got some monster meat and killed a beefalo or two for fur, then I did meaty stew. I never went below 30 rabbits in my chests at any given time 




 Yeah I don't have the expansion so I just have the two seasons. I didn't know that until halfway through my winter in my current game. I was running around in a panic trying to figure out what I need to do and gather so I can be ready for the hot summer because of all the things I saw on the wiki and what I read here.  




 Do you have the expansion? There is apparently one boss each season in the expansion but just the deerclops in the original. I actually had the deerclops appear at my base at the end of winter. My screen was shaking and all I saw were it's legs at the top of my screen and I ran for my fucking life and forgot the food I desperately needed from my crockpot. Luckily I ran to where I had rabbit traps and ate some of them 




 I'm on my second attempt at winter right now, and I have an awesome placement minus not having bees nearby. Right near a wormhole that leads directly to beefalo, which is worth the sanity penalty, especially when I get my butterfly farm in order this next summer (I don't have the expansion). There are several pigs and sliders not too far away, I'm near a big tallbird nest if I want that, and below me is a plain with plenty of rabbit holes that ha e been my source of food pretty much this whole game. Right now I have about 40 or so unmurdered rabbits and at any given time I can go out to my traps and collect about 2 days worth of rabbit for meatballs. 

I cant wait for winter to be over though, about halfway through I unwittingly activated a winter trap so I get an extra long one 




 My wife does that basically. She keeps badgering me to build drying racks. I suppose they're great for preserving meat and saving space on not needing as many chests, but I've been living with a single crock pot all winter so far without problems  




 Why hello there, me 




 How does this ha e anything to do with technology?  




 Thanks for actually showing me something. Looks like the ones near me are staying open for now  




 I tried searching Google but I found a bunch of click bait.  




 There a list that isn't so shitty? Maybe one that lists by state?  




 Some people use a controller so we're unable to mouse over to confirm  




 Is this a thing? My son is 7 months and for the second time in around a week just before he fell completely to sleep he started screaming bloody murder but wasn't really awake and crying. Usually despite being hard to actually put to bed in the first place, he sleeps pretty well. It seems that every approach to calm him down including letting him try to self sooth just sends him further into the frenzy 

Anyone else experience this and have insight as to what I can do? 




 Are you at home where your app can detect your chromecast?

 You probably got plenty of money's worth with the game on PC, what would be their incentive to give the mobile version of the game to you for free? Why would they want to develop a mobile version if they didn't intend on making money from it?  




 I realize that I can use the keys to keep it shut but I open and close this thing upwards of 15 times a day,ibxant be fumbling with a key each time  














 Even worse are gut farts. When your intestines make uncontrollable noises that sound like farts. I always seemed to get those when I'd be in the completely silent computer lab 




 When I worked at olive garden, we had what seemed like 4 menus going at the same time. One was just that, a menu with little to no description, just pictures. And the items on that menu always sold the most. I always called it the dumb people menu because they can just point at the picture.  




 Steam doesn't link with Google play or the app store so it's not likely that getting the game for free if you purchased a steam version will ever happen.  




 Well it's highly situational. If I did a job where I was able to spend 5 or more hours per day listening to podcasts while I work then I would be all for that. I'm a delivery driver who has to merchandise my own product, and luckily my route takes me anywhere from a half hour to an hour and 15 minutes out of town so I do still get a bunch of time to listen to stuff, but it only amounts to about 10 hours per week. I like to keep a variety of podcasts in my Playlist but I want it to match the approximate time I am able to listen, that way I don't get behind on them. I only ever really listen to them while driving for work and don't go out of my way to listen to podcasts at home because my computer time is few and far between anyway at home that I try to spend time productively when I do have it. 

I've considered headphones but cables always seem to get in the way doing this kind of work 




 I hope to god if they do that it doesn't end up as another 3-4 hour podcast. I like the podcast and all but one podcast is already around a third of the time I have each week to listen to podcasts 




 I subscribe to /r/games and obviously this sub. I directly subscribe to specific game subreddits that I'm interested in. Other than that, I listen to the GiantBomb Podcast while driving. I drive about 10 hours per week for work and luckily my work Truck has an Aux port for the stereo so I've taken to listen to a bunch of podcasts. It's nice to not have to take the time outside of work to catch up on the rest of the world by listening to podcasts, otherwise I'd be stuck listening to all the same songs the radio let's me listen to 




 We started noticing a flat spot on his head around 2 months or so and we've tried to keep him off his back as much as possible but early on he hated tummy time and it was hard to keep him off his back short of holding him all day long until it was bed time. 

We got to a point where he could stand tummy time and we keep him sitting up since he can do that on his own now. He isn't crawling yet but he rolls from his tummy to his back all the time so there's still lots of spending time to make sure he's not on his back but there's still the 10 hours of sleep each night he still spends on his back and I feel that it had countered all of our attempts at helping the flat spot. 

Is there anything that can really be done at this point? I keep reading that it should have rounded out by 6 months and that helmets don't really help at all. The wife is a little upset about it because she mentioned it to the doctor a couple months ago and he said it wouldn't be anything to worry about but at the most recent visit he brought up the flat spot and mentioned wanting to look at it again in a month

 Most likely you'll end up in Mullan wing if you go to Johnstone. Pryor and Colter are 21+. The rooms are decent sized and you get the benefit of not having to go outside when you want to eat. If I remember right, they're separating North and South hedges from connecting to their dining hall directly. 

Other plus sides:

* pickle barrel is across the street 

* Joes Parkway is across the street

Downsides:

* you have to walk up that long hill for class every day

* abysmal parking  




 You don't need a cat tower. Yeah they're nice but you can build your own if you have the tools or materials. Alternatively you can get boxes, attach them together, find scraps of carpet, even ask a carpet store if there are garbage pieces you could have, and attach that to the sides of a box and you have your very own cat castle

 What I said was only the Cliffs notes version. It's actually a little more complex. The final stream is rendered at 24fps. Main objects are animated anywhere from 8-12 fps and secondary objects 6-8 fps 




 Animes usually run around 12 frames per second. In animation studios, artists create key frames every x amount of frames and then basically interns draw up everything in between. The person that did this essentially created all the key frames. What you're asking is that the person draw over 720 images for about 2 minutes of video to make it smooth

 And then raising prices while limiting promotions and wondering why the sales staff are incompetent because these are great prices and there's no way that higher prices will cause sales to drop, right?  




 Maybe businesses should be liable, but fellow employees should not be punished as well. When I worked in a restaurant, we had about 150 employees. Are you suggesting that 150 people should take home only 3/4 of their normal monthly income as a result of the actions of one or two people?  




 I have several thoughts/points:

* Kramer should be charged with negligent homicide. Even if she didn't know he was in the bed of the truck when she drove, it was still her direct actions that caused his death. 

* serving alcohol after 2 is a bad idea, even if it is a stupid law

* the laws concerning serving intoxicated people really don't make sense and as far as I'm concerned, takes away the responsibility of the person consuming the alcohol and places it directly on grocery stores, convenience stores, bars, and their respective employees. Having personally worked a job where I dealt with drunk people, the best way to cause a scene that would have never happened is to say no. Bartenders are not babysitters, they should only have to kick people out or cut them off if someone is causing problems. About 6 or so months ago an employee of the downtown Holiday gas ststion refused to sell alcohol to someone who came into the store. He left, but stayed around to jump the employee as she was walking to her car after her shift and hospitalized her. Money being spent to enforce these laws should be put to transportation programs that help intoxicated people get home from the bars.  

* one person screws up and the entire staff of three different bars/restaurants are out of work for three days. Most servers and cooks already don't make much and live paycheck to paycheck and now one paycheck this month will be halved. I'm imagining several employees struggling to make rent for next month.

 I was the sauce and soup guy, I frequently had nightmares about not having the ingredients I needed to get through the day because it happened often enough and the response from management was always shitty: I felt like I was bothering them with my shitty problem and most of the time they were apathetic about resolving it quickly. It would put me behind on my prep, and Lo and behold the first customer that walks in the door when we open wants a dish that requires the sauce I don't have and then the line is freaking out and then my managers freak out even though I told them I can't make it. One time we ran out of heavy cream and I couldn't make fucking Alfredo and I didn't even get the cream until a half hour after we opened  




 Do you know how to use tags and Playlists to make customers home lists for shows? I recommend looking that stuff up. I tagged all the kid friendly stuff as cartoons and tagged the anime separately,  then I made custom menu buttons that lead to those tagged shows. Then I made a smart Playlist that has all the TV shows excluding the shows that have the cartoon or anime tags, that way my TV shows menu has everything but cartoons and anime. 

You could do this same thing for your kids profiles so then they only have access to what Playlists you set up

 Someone mentioned this in one of my other posts. I kinda got used to/liked the harsher blue light 




 If any of you have seen my posts before, my original M8 has a cracked camera lens so I did the advanced exchange program. My first replacement (left) was distinctly not as bright and had a yellow hue so I called customer service and they sent another one (right) which is a little closer to my original. I don't want to do the song and dance of having to send in phone after phone after phone until I get one that looks "right" to me so I'm accepting the second replacement. I suppose after a day of use I won't even notice when I don't have a control to compare it against.

At one point I had all three phones so I had to take this picture because really, how often does a guy get to temporarily possess three HTC One M8's?. To compare the brightess I used a fast shutter speed and darkened the picture further

 I don't mind getting smudges on my hand, but what does washing your hand with dish soap do? 

I was more asking about how you deal with the spirals impeding your ability to draw without physical obstacles for your hand  




 I know there are vertical spiral books out there but the ones I found had less than half the amount of paper as the regular spiral ones. I'm sure there will be some drawings where I'll have the spiral to the top if I do a landscape sketch/drawing, but I want to pick an orientation and stick with it. 

The options I'm trying with is using normal orientation of the book but flipping the page all the way around and drawing on the back, or I can start from the back and work through the book backwards, or to keep the drawings on I guess "the front" I can turn the book upside down and work "backwards" 

What works best for my leftie family? 




 Idea of the year right here 




 So in the end I'm better off building my own boxes if I want them to last longer?  




 After being a part of this subreddit since before I bought my M8, I can't help but feel there is/was some QA problems in the manufacturing process. The M8 doesn't seem to provide the same experience for everyone across the board and there are many issues I've read that occur for some but not others. 

I've compiled a short list of the problems I've seen or experienced myself (and unfortunately I've experienced a good chunk of them):

* easily scratched camera lens that will cause blurry pictures

* the possibility that the lens can crack without having dropped or damaged the phone

* "loose" audio jack. Some audio plugs don't seem to make a tight connection with the audio jack and it's luck of the draw that what you have will work fine. Some cables or headphones will pop out of the last connection just enough that audio stops like you pulled the headphones out. Sometimes plugging headphones in will bring up the Google now voice search

* USB port becoming loose or damaged over time. Sometimes plugging a USB cable in will start dock mode, even if it's the same cable you always use that hasn't done it before. Sometimes the phone will get stuck in dock mode or USB host mode and refuse to charge. 

* notification LED. I saw many complaints about the led being nearly impossible to see. I've gone through three replacement M8's due to the cracked lens and then receiving yellow hue screen phones. Each replacement had an LED much brighter and easier to see at an angle than my original device.  

* different screen manufacturers. Some serial numbers have a brighter blue hue to the screen with more accurate looking whites, and some will have a yellow hue. Most people don't notice this unless they've gotten theirs exchanged and happened to look at the two side by side 

Feel free to add anything I missed. What are your thoughts on what happened with the manufacturing process with this phone? What symptoms have you experienced yourself? What issues would you like to be resolved with the impending M9 or other htc flagship? 




 How do you mean shot? They just fell apart? I feel that if I were to use them I'd throw some screws into the corners for reinforcement  




 I have that same 5.1 logitech speaker set. Still going strong for what, around 10 years now? Pretty darn good bang for the buck. I think I bought the set for $55 new.

 I couldn't really explain why. It's just that if I were given the choice of any other fish at this time in my life, I would choose Steelhead every time.  




 And that's the only reason it's happening: The government is heavily subsidizing the development. Without that, there is no incentive to do anything because there aren't enough people in rural areas for them to be profitable spending the money to dig the lines 




 IKEA definitely. 




 Steelhead is by far one of the best fish I've ever eaten  




 Mine is April 2014 so I'm not sure about the later models getting better screens theory you have :/ 




 The one I'm sending in is HT44 




 I recently exchanged my M8 using the Advanced Exchange program because of a cracked camera lens. The phone I received in the mail is distinctly warm in color, whereas the phone i was about to send in was cooler, and had more of a blueish color when looking at whites. I called HTC customer support and they had me return the replacement phone and they would send me another, but the one I just got today is exactly the same. I gotta say I'm a tad bit disappointed. I don't want to have to keep returning the replacements until they get fed up with me so I'm going to have to get used to it and say goodbye to the one I'm sending in.

Did anyone else get their phone replaced and noticed a different screen hue? 




 You're in for a treat. I have the M8 and absolutely love it. So far it's the only phone I've had that I didn't want to replace after 6 months  




 8 months ago I was struggling to pay my bills on time and was over $16,000 in debt.  I got a better job at the end of April and today I have $11,000 left to pay 









 I really like the feel of this. Good job dude 




 For the most part notifications aren't the problem on the M8. It's all the icons that have to be on the status bar at all times. Like having an alarm set, when nfc is enables, or whatever you're listening to music, the boomsound and headphones icons.  




 And honesty, that looks goddamn amazing for being over 10 years old.  




 Eve Online has gone through several graphics engine overhauls.  




 There's a lot of rural and empty space where it isn't financially feasible to dig lines to houses in the middle of nowhere unless it's a significant development so it's not surprising to me. If you live in a city there are good chances you have access to Charter which has 30mbit internet and up to 60 in some cities. 

No matter what state you live in, if you're in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, don't expect landlines to your house unless you pay out of pocket to dig them yourself  




 Even if you aren't manually twisting a handle to roll a window up, there are still rollers controlled by electric motors to move the window up and down so it still makes sense  




 Not even Google translate could decipher this website. Not very useful information for the majority of this subreddit  




 I'm sure someone will pick up the mantle

Q. I don't want your bot in my subreddit!
Certainly, I recognize that not every subreddit is a place for image_linker_bot. It already abides by the Bottiquette ban list, and deletes comments that end up with negative votes.
If you don't want any bots in your subreddit, I'd recommend taking a minute to add yourself to the Bottiquette list.
If you just don't want image_linker_bot in your subreddit, or don't want to do the above, just send a modmail or post here with the subreddit(s) you want the bot to ignore and I'll add you to the list. 




 I don't think it's the fault of the bot. The bot simply replies to any person who names an image in its repository where the bot is allowed to look  




 ... So is it using the right image or not?

 Well eventually sonarr will have movies. I'm in the same boat for movies. Couch potato was like entropy for me. It worked except when it didn't. Constantly crashed too. I don't really like using dognzb watchlists but it works for now 




 But it's not pay to win. This is how in app purchases should be done
