 If that doesn't happen, all gods are bastards. 




 I think what I was getting at is that in the show the millionaires would not be able to take courses, as they wouldn't be able to afford them and wouldn't have the time.  




 Damn shame; I'd have been interested to hear his thoughts on the matter (after being translated into english). 




 Ooooh narrated by Robert Webb. Interesting! 

Edit: So the kids keep partying and acting like entitled cunts? I guess some change is better than none... source: watched some clips 




 Hahaha! If had gold to give, I would. That's amazing! 




 Hah, nice 




 Oh, I like that idea. A bit harsh though (in that you'd need a judge); getting people to partake in the show would be tough. 




 The psychological effects of poverty, and the inability to escape it, are some of the biggest problems at hand. 




 And then cancel it as it gained popularity 




 Awesome :D 




 There already exists a show like you described in your last paragraph (Secret Millionaire). That said, increased awareness and discontent with wealth disparity would add pressure for political change. Not that I'm saying a TV show could do that, but I believe that to be the general point of the matter. 




 That's the big problem with this idea. Current options include fame and charity. 




 Right, I forgot scholarships are easy to come by :p 

And for the show, the contestants would actually need to work a minimum wage job. 




 Them too, for sure. 




 Inherited it? 




 Boy, that escalated quickly 




 I try to avoid /r/politics and /r/atheism because of hive mind mentality. I suppose this is a complex issue (the minimum wage   wealth disparity)...
