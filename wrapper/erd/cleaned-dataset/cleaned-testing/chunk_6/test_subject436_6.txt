 You know it's serious when the CDC tells you to **kill it with fire**. 




 Kind of a side question because I don't work in stem cells (although I am in biology and biotechnology): Why don't people try to replenish progenitor cells or other "not as embryonic" stem cells in the hierarchy using iPS methods? We know where many of them reside and it could be as simple as generating the cell line and then reinjecting it back into the patient at a specific location. 




 Also one big part of the increased survival is **early detection**!! Get screened early and most things can be surgically removed. Surgery is still the gold standard and is really the only "curative" method, but only works when the cancer is in its early stages and has not metastasized.

People might say that mammograms and PSA tests don't have much benefit and that's certainly debatable, but gastrointestinal and cervical screenings have had a HUGE effect. 




 I think this must have been something they've been working on for a long time but put it on the backburner because it "wouldn't be worth the manpower". Something obviously changed in the last 2-3 years when they were planning the features for Windows 9. It might be as simple as a software workaround/"emulation" for drivers that refuse to work in W8/W9. Windows 7/Vista/XP have had "compatibility mode" for older programs for years, so this would just be the next step but on a much deeper level. 




 I was born in HK and am definitely very pro-democracy, but let's give China some reserved credit here for the first few days of the protest.

If this was done in America, there would be riots, smashed storefronts, and police brutality everywhere. While tear gas and pepper spray are still quite strong anti-democratic weapons, the amount of restraint by the HK police is phenomenal so far. **There has not been one single gunshot.** Remember, there are probably over 10k people sitting on that little strip and nobody has died. I realize that the bar for police civility is quite low, but they have managed to exceed my expectations.

Just remember what was happening in the Ukraine and during the Arab Spring. I have to commend the HK protesters for keeping disciplined and non-violent, and the HK police for not shooting at anyone. 




 I agree, let's give some reserved credit to China/the HK police for not shooting people. I'm not sure if this will continue, but I'm optimistic that China knows (1) the world is watching them, (2) they will lose all legitimacy in HK if they apply force. 




 I don't think the West needs to do anything if China starts shooting. HK can fuck shit up all on its own. It's not like you have a large pro-China presence there like in the other sketchy parts of the country (eg. Xinjiang, etc). 




 There is a huge difference between being irritable and acting like a 5 year old though. 




 Also, isn't that pretty arrogant? Just because he has a solid fanbase doesn't mean they are constantly checking his Twitter feed or associated social media. I like his movies but I have a day job. 




 I lived in Boston for six years and I absolutely agree. Drivers need to be forced to slow down because they think they are infallible on the road. They drive like they are on a race track. Granted it probably varies by city but they are likely to be more aggressive in big cities. 




 I didn't think it was awful, but it was way too long. I didn't see the point of that entire lock down magnet sequence. 




 OWS was very different than this. OWS purposely did not have a political goal and was meant to subvert the system. HKers are protesting for universal suffrage, a very concrete objective. 




 Can we get a livethread set up for this? This is as big if not bigger than the Ukraine situation. 




 ??? Property taxes go up too! Often it can be very fast depending on how hot your neighborhood is. 




 He was also responsible for the glass steagal nightmare that led to the bank crash. 




 I don't think Samantha Bee is funny anymore. Jason Jones has kicked it up quite a bit. Michael Che was surprisingly very good but too bad he got poached. Al Madrigal and Aasif Mandvi are really solid and I'm surprised Larry Wilmore got picked. 




 Just to jump in: you're not going to find use in doing scans of single cells. This would be useless for many types of blood cancers. But it's kind of incredible if they can use this for deep tissue imaging of solid tumors. Normally they appear as a mass of cells that just look pretty fucked up. This easily identifiable for a pathologist but kind of hard to do during surgery.

As far as I know, in a typical oncological surgery operation, what they think is the tumor + buffer room is excised from the patient. At that point they will take sections of the ends and quickly make sides for a pathologist to examine *immediately*. They keep cutting until they find nothing.

If this technology could speed that up while having no loss or even an improvement in sensitivity, then it is a big deal. 




 You make a really good point. These phones were not built to last. They may not bend now, but in 3 years they might look pretty warped with daily force. Planned obsolescence.

Apple is doing some terrible PR. Jobs isn't here any longer so saying that the problem doesn't exist or to minimize it by saying only 9 people have complained is a terrible tactic. You never confront the issue by denying theres a problem, especially because there's something that customers can obviously see on the internet that is the opposite. Similarly with the antenna and maps: just acknowledge that some people may have problems and sweeten the deal with a case with no questions asked. 




 I don't know, some people have blue cheese or stronger in their burger... 




 Kind of nitpicky, but that bun didn't look so great compared to that giant hunk of meat. Also, Wagyu/Kobe is not really the best type of beef for a burger. 




 Some of them have skin/fur problems that require the occasional shampoo. 




 Actually, that's pretty incredible thinking. What are the taxes on investment dividends and do they trigger when you apply them directly to things like lines of credit? In that case then it's essentially free money. 




 Do you seriously think that China and Britain are on equivalent levels here? One of these countries has an established rule of law (including courts, an efficient police system) and constitution upon which HK based all their laws. Mercantilism and the finance industry boomed in HK largely because of the British. You also have property rights and healthy private businesses.

In China you have no freedom of speech, a censored internet, a farce of a court system, barely any private property rights, and a business culture where the only businesses that succeed are government spinoffs.

Sure, there are problems with Britain and were problems with their rule pre-1997, but it sure as fuck was better than having China look over your shoulder.

Although I may be biased, because I'm from there. 




 Don't worry, China's not stupid. If there ends up being any deaths of these students, the Chinese government will execute those officers involved. If not, the HK population will riot and fuck shit up. We're talking about 7 million people in densities higher than NYC.

FWIW, people in HK do NOT see themselves as part of the mainland. There is a huge nativist/xenophobic/"nationalist" sentiment against mainland Chinese, who are easy to identify because they speak only Mandarin. Their only legitimacy in HK is because of an agreement that HK will keep its government and that the Basic Law will be enforced.

HKers are also much more affluent and educated than other minorities in China (eg. Uighurs, etc). Classical oppressive tactics are not going to work here, and China realizes that. 




 Side question: I don't work in chemical library screen but some labs next to me do. How much these libraries typically cost, and how many assays can you perform with them? Seems to me that they can be a resource that depratments could potentially share. 




 Channing Tatum looks absolutely hilarious in this. People think this movie actually looks good? It looks like every single sci-fi trope put together. 




 The big problem with the art direction in Wachowski films is that none of it seems particularly "thoughtful". Everything looks like it was just thrown in together without much forethought. 




 Do you think a good solution would be for companies to stop selling chemical libraries that include PAINS? I think there would be a pretty nice market for that. 




 /r/biology is basically a better version of /r/science. 




 Y2H was problematic especially because of the "false hit" problem. When I started graduate school it was starting to become recognized and now I think scientists generally know about it now. 




 HEPES? Really? That's quite shocking to me considering it's used in a ton of protein purification and storage buffers.

His tags have been known to be problematic for quite a long time. It's quite common now to cleave out the affinity tag so you're just left with either the original length of your POI or a small peptide scar. 




 Don't worry, that won't happen. China knows they are walking a very fine line. As soon as there is violent suppression of the protests they will lose all legitimacy on the island and it will spiral out of control. Contrary to what everyone else sees, China only has tenuous control of the entire country so long as economic conditions are growing. That's why they are so worried about a slowdown in growth (even if it's at 7%!!! this year). 

In Hong Kong, you have 90% of the population that is essentially nativist/"nationalist" against outside influence. The only reason why China hasn't seen more resistance is because they agreed to the "don't fuck with us and we won't riot" treaty in 1997. If this escalates to violence, you can't stop 6+ million people from throwing out the government. Once this starts, you know that other large cities will start to push back.

Also keep in mind that by and large HK is much more affluent than the rest of China. They aren't bound by the same economic social contract. They are genuinely concerned for their rights, as opposed to many mainland Chinese who will put up with a lot of oppression for economic growth.

 That... that is an amazing pepper spray defense.

Just keep this in mind. Curcumin is one of the offenders and it's in turmeric. 









 I think that's a little optimistic about Amazon. They might not go bankrupt or disappear, but they could become a shadow of their current selves. 

As an example, Dell and HP were in a race to the bottom for prices as well as fighting tooth and nail for razor thin margins. The economic downturn and progressively cheaper components was really bad for them. 

For Amazon, if their margins are steadily decreasing because of the simultaneous decrease in the cost of infrastructure and hypercompetition in pricing, then at some point it becomes very difficult to keep yourself afloat. 




 A lot of people complain that H1Bs prevent hiring of American software engineers. The problem is that companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook doesn't just want to hire any asshole that comes out of college. The H1B is a nice mechanism because it expands your labor pool to the entire world!

Think about it this way: if you are a multi-billion dollar company hiring for an entry-level coding position, would you hire a foreigner or a college graduate if their coding expertise was just mediocre? You would definitely hire the first one if you could pay them less and given all other things are equal.

The interesting part is when you start getting to the really skilled workers. If you are looking for a very specific skill set, why would you only look in the American pool? For some reason people only think India or China, but there are tons of very skilled workers in Europe that companies would like to bring here. 




 Releasing January 9th? January is the month where bad movies go to die... 




 I think in theory that is a great idea, but in practice it is impossible to look for something that the customer will remember.  




 I had to do something trivial with BofA on the phone once. One question was my last bill payment amount. Why would I even remember something like that? 




 People should watch Better Luck Tomorrow before they rag on Justin Lin. 




 They wouldn't pick Justin Lin if they didn't think he could pull it off. The first two episodes could possibly be extremely action packed and they needed someone who can direct that kind of thing. The second season is about mobsters, after all. 




 I think it's interesting to note that various animals (eg. some kinds of parrots and dogs) start to develop all kinds of mental and emotional disorders when they have nothing to do, have lack of stimulus in their life, or are bored. It's probably not a coincidence that we experience the same behaviors when life was not more regimented or was "more exciting" so to speak. 




 Python's a tricky one to learn because there's not a specific coding dogma (as compared to C++, that is). I had formal education in C/C++ and a few other low level languages, and the one thing that I was taught was that there was a specific "style" that has a little bit of wiggle room to account for different best coding practices in different coding shops. Python is really expressive, which means that while it's easy to read what's going on (and easy to do "elegant" "one liners"), it has the side effect of being able to put in a lot of personal style into the code which makes it much harder to learn if you're a newbie. 




 Students should be able to fact-check their teachers in science class and get extra credit for finding errors. Gives them something better to do than texting their friends all the time and they get to be actively searching about science at the same time. In high school I corrected my teacher all the time in Math class, and I never got disciplined for it. 




 Trying to upvote you to the top. The point is that the "rate" of evolution is really determined by the strength of the selection pressure. Punctuated equilibrium is saying that evolution generally revolves around "strong" selection pressures, which doesn't make any sense considering the amount of diversity out there and considering the pervasive level of genetic drift. 




 The ONLY movie where something like this was reasonably brought up (ie. negative consequences of superheroes having a lot of "neighborhood" damage) was Transformers 4. That's a pretty low bar to jump and yet very few sequels or movies actually address it. I suppose IM3 and CA2 address it somewhat but they weren't central points to the movie. 




 Also, I'm sure Supes indirectly killed thousands of people with all the Metropolis carnage and the final fight with Zod. 




 PROTIP: If you see anything that says "MSG free", but has "hydrolyzed yeast", hydrolyzed protein, or "amino acid salts" on the ingredient list.... that's MSG! Tons of people happily buy this and think they're getting a "healthier" meal. 




 Milk is the only one with a really high lactose content. And even then most people just have mild symptoms. Do you fart a lot? Try not drinking milk. 




 Not to mention about half of the cheese that you buy at the supermarket is of domestic origin. Yes, even the fancy ones. 




 It really depends on the cheese. Old aged ones are very low in lactose, but fresher ones like ricotta and mozzarella aren't great choices for those who are lactose intolerant. 




 I had thought squirrels were herbivores, until a few years back when I saw a very pregnant squirrel eating a giant chicken leg on a fence.... 




 Does Keifer Sutherland count? His dad's Canadian.

Oops, I guess he's well known in the USA so that doesn't work for this thread. 




 I bet the US military would be the first to make long range electric aircraft. Practically zero noise so they could make drones invisible. Same with stealth bombers. 




 A silver lining: after WWII, most German cities were reduced to rubble. But they painstakingly restored and rebuilt entire cities based on historical documents and photographs. Could that be done here? It's a total longshot but it could be something that would get a lot of international support. 




 Random question: when do the recent presidents (eg. Clinton, GW Bush, Obama) get a named carrier? 




 They can sell it in illegal trucks. Maintaining a properly supply line in a conflict is another thing. For one, that would be a dead giveaway on satellite and just invites a drone visit. They aren't that dumb. 




 The US was sending some troops to help build facilities over there. What we need are armed guards to help protect the medical staff. If the host country cannot ensure their safety (eg. with their own security forces), then it's fair game to have an outside force impose order in this kind of situation. It's way too late to have some kind of debate about how to properly deal with cultural differences in medical beliefs. People are dying *today*. 




 Are most girls really that self-conscious about taking a poo at someone's place? Honest question, because my current partner is my first and only long-term girlfriend and I am pretty sure she didn't even hesitate to use the bathroom at my place. 




 Also, it's pretty much inconsequential considering the margin of victory. Do you think some table shenanigans can swing the vote by that much? 




 Interesting point. How would one attempt to detect womholes with a telescope? 




 Who cares about plot consistency? If you keep track of comic books then you'd know that things have been ret-conned and rebooted ad nauseum. Thor just became a woman, Wolverine is gonna die, and Spiderman is finally coming back after being taken over by doc ock. 




 There was a reddit comment a few days ago where this European speculated that the reason Europeans dress so well is because there's no space for giant houses or other expensive items. So expensive clothing replaced all those things and became a status symbol. 




 It's actually a lot easier to make pasta in a restaurant setting: The morning of they usually cook it to within 1-2 minutes of al dente. Once an order comes in they throw it in water for a bit, then sauce it up and you're done.

Edit: It seems like OG needs to have a Domino's style makeover that happened a few years back. Sure, Domino's is still not great, but they got a lot better when they admitted that their food sucked. 




 Even Golden Dawn stepped up the xenophobic hysteria in the past few years. People talk about how Europe is the pinnacle of civilization but it doesn't take much for them to go back to violent times. 




 I think you should modify that last statement: it could be very well that some human ancestor and chimpanzee ancestor (that have diverged from our common ancestor) were competing for the same resources, but that either (a) the human ancestors were more successful and contributed to reduced resource availability for chimpanzees and leading to their aggressiveness, or (b) the competition between species made them naturally more violent.

On the other hand, it is very possible that the great ape ancestor was very violent and that bonobos and humans acquired mutations that reduced it but not in the chimpanzee. It's known that pair bonding and other adaptations in humans made us much less violent (even though we're still pretty bad), and it's likely that the bonobo's lack of aggression in community living has a genetic component. 




 Also, let's be honest here: a lot of the hubbub in the news is with regards to *meta*-data tracking. Apple said they don't know what you sent, but do they keep records of data transit? How secure is the meta-data behind each "transaction"? 




 I was in electrical engineering and not CS in college so maybe the curriculums are different. But we had a few courses dedicated to assembly so this didn't seem too bad. Keep in mind that the biggest obstacle here was to recognize that the program was detecting a debug mode and to know how to hijack that check. The level 2 challenge should be much harder. 




 I think college town police tend to show up rather fast since there's not much going on. Especially if there is a weapon involved. 




 Just like to point out that low n values do not necessarily mean that it's bad. If the effect sizes are large and if the populations were segregated properly (eg. proper experimental design), then you can get away with pretty small sample sizes. 




 A pound of coffee per week seems like a lot. How many cups do you make a day? Coarse grind means that you have to use more bean for the same strength, so if you switch to very fine grind with a cone filter pour-over you can save a lot of coffee. 




 I think the two "series" are actually quite decent if you take them to be what they are. They're very different movies thematically but quite decent in their own genre. 




 I thought the second was the best in the series. The third fell flat for me because it felt like there was no suspense, and much of the supporting cast (eg. Julia Stiles IIRC) was only in the movie for 20 minutes at most. 




 IMO? Multiple reports have said that Notch was the guy who approached Microsoft about the acquisition in the first place. 




 Samsung's flagship Galaxy S line didn't even get NFC until S3 which was released in 2012 (some versions of the S2 had NFC in 2011). As far as I know, the entire Nexus line has NFC but those didn't sell very well. Likewise on the Droid line, NFC wasn't even a thing until the Droid Incredible 4G came out. 




 I don't think this will take off anytime soon, considering that only a small fraction of smartphones out there have NFC.

Starbucks had a better idea that works for most smartphones: just display a barcode on the screen for the scanner to read. 




 I agree. If they thought that surrender meant a lifetime in Gitmo then they would probably fight to the death. But if you give them an attractive way out then you can really break morale while you are bombing the shit out of them. 




 If you have problems meditating, studies have shown that walks provide similar stress relieving benefits. It has to be a long walk though. 




 A lot of his newer stuff on youtube isn't too bad. I think he grew up quite a bit since his freestyle days. 




 Won't all the extra water from the spinach make it soggy? 




 Mine too! I think it's standard in most electric toothbrushes. 




 This rationale is good in theory. But in practice it is not uniformly applied. See Bowe Bergdahl and other POWs. Many of them have no special intelligence value, and yet the US goes to extreme lengths to get them back (eg. prisoner swaps). 

This implies that soldiers are worth more than reporters and civilians. Even ones that royally fucked up and walked off a base. Think about that for a second. 




 She was moving it around too much, probably because of habit from regular brushes. You're also supposed to use it for 2 minutes which she didn't do. 




 Can't help but notice that she's using her electric toothbrush completely wrong.  




 It depends. If you're on a long distance roadtrip then going above the speed limit will for sure get you there faster. But you are right in that if you are commuting to work, driving defensively and at the speed limit actually gets you there at around the same time. 




 I lived in Germany for a good while and asked my friends this exact question. They told me that everyone leaves work "early" on a Friday to get their grocery shopping done. 




 I think my point was that Holmes (and Watson) serve as our eyes and ears and hearts in the books. By explicitly bring out the "false dilemma" the author is trying to induce the same feelings in the reader, but the problem is that it ends up feeling phony because I don't think any reasonable person would ever feel as sympathetic as they did in that situation. 




 I think that kind of generalization only works if you're white. 




 I really hate this part about fiction. The author presents a false dichotomy to make it appear as if there was a real moral dilemma -- being abused doesn't legitimize murder. There are plenty of ways to get back onto the will without outright killing someone. 




 OMG. 




 But doesn't occupying an area for camping change animal habits in the first place? Leaving them alone by not camping would be the best option. 




 Just like all conspiracy theories, people have a yearning for creating narratives and especially so for things they don't understand. It's pretty much instinctive for humans to believe that things "happen for a reason" and some people end up applying this to the entire world's events. 




 Agreed. The US doesn't have the political will to outright declare war on Syria. Even if the US completely obliterates ISIS, there is no way they can arm Syrian rebels with enough firepower to take out Assad on their own. I guess Obama/his successor can pull a Libya and do it the airstrike way but I feel like you could only pull the "let's bomb a country but it's not really declaring war" card once. 




 Canadian here. 9/11 happened on the first or second week of my first year in University. I remember going down the stairs for class and noticed everyone glued to the television screen in the lounge. For the rest of the day I thought "Welp, this is WWIII" because (as far as I can remember) we had no idea who was responsible and I just assumed it was another country.

Then a few weeks later the US invades Afghanistan, I remember thinking "how did they figure that out so fast?" I thought it was a little rushed and somewhat drastic to be invading an entire country for a terrorist attack. I held out hope that something good would come out of it. When they invaded Iraq a little while later I was thinking "wait, what's happening here?" I held onto hope that they would at least be able to build a proper state, but I guess the jury's still out on that. 




 The Hawaii scene was so abrupt that for a while I was convinced that they accidentally deleted the CG work! It's happened before at Pixar. 




 It was a lot better than #1 and #2. The main problem was that the movie was too long. At about the 2 hour mark I started getting bored. The last scene with Lockdown's ship returning was not even necessary. 




 One day I wore plaid shorts with a (dense, thin lined) striped button up shirt. My girlfriend laughed at me! 




 Or you could do it the amazon way and rank by helpful/not helpful! 




 The most interesting thing is that the top school rankings haven't really changed all that much in the past decades. You still have complete dominance from "Western" schools, with very little penetrance from Asian ones. This is in spite of the fact that many East Asian countries are pouring in money for post-secondary education and research, while Western university funding is flat or declining. 









 I wouldn't call MSU a joke. LSU, on the other hand... 




 It's the long con. They play all cutesy before you start dating, but they slowly escalate the tiger mom persona.  




 It's a pretty common stereotype in Germany that most stolen stuff flows in and out of Poland.  




 As far as I know, the homology search by Cas9 starts by binding to a PAM sequence. So you absolutely need one even if it is dCas9. Other species of Cas9 have different PAM requirements though.  




 Somethings not right with the math. The US population is approximately 300 million people including elderly and children. The labor participation rate is about 62% according to the department of labor, meaning that a lot of those Op counts as unemployed could just be the elderly ageing out.  




 Here's an even better example: reddit admins allow for all kinds of marijuana and other drug-related subs to flourish, even though some are clearly in extreme violation of federal law. In these cases, the admins have decided that (a) they probably won't get into legal trouble, and/or (b) disagree with the law and hence won't censor it in contrast to other removed content. Either way it sets a pretty bad precedent.
