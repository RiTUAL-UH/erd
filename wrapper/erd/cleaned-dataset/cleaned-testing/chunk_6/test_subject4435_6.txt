 Kuru, yes? Human prion disease. Only read about half so far but needed to comment before I forgot.
Edit: X-files junkie. Prone to diagnosing everyone with Kuru and other random stuff.
Sorry about your dad, OP. 




 Take that bottle of ink you gathered to a police man okay? Tell him where you found it and that daddy is uspet about it and that Maisey is gone away. He'll have special stuff to get it out of the carpet with. 




 Can you elaborate a bit? 




 Seconded. 




 Did you get your shirt back? :( 




 Too bad the're not selling condoms, common sense, and rehab. 




 Yeah that. 




 So accurate. Half the guys I went to school with are out West now. 




 Dude. Cops and some friends. Get out there and investigate during daylight. Your missing friend is connected to that house. Please update us with what you find. 




 Nova Scotia here. Wonder how long it'll take the drug to reach us. Probably the summer when all the boys come home to visit.  




 Drugs containing a lot of sulphur can turn your blood green/blueish.  




 It's alright. Just struck me funny. I have the most boring innocuous birthday ever so something scary happening on that day is... strange to say the least. 




 Be safe. Ask a nurse if they have a charger you can borrow. Oddly enough I had great luck with that when I was in hospital.  How did you end up there? 




 Upsetting that you woke up there on my birthday.  




 Talk to her! Maybe she knows whats going on! 




 Update please. 




 Did you put her there? 




 Dude. My suggestion is wrap yourself in garbage bags and duct tape and burn that mofo!
Ps. Sorry about Vern. :( 




 Whatever it is, give it the fuck back! 




 Hopefully the cover cleaner is alright. The sterling silver is just a wive's tale my grandmere used to tell me but I've seen it mentioned in my research, as a way to protect yourself. So it has to be worth a shot. 




 This is removed but was it connected to the infected town? 




 Nosleep is here. Talk to us. We can help. 




 Man... 
I have an odd relationship with one of my exes. We love one another and we're really close with a weird bond no one can understand. Anyway. In October I was talking to my Mum about said ex and saying I thought his girlfriend might be pregnant. So I had asked him about it and he was surprised as they had just found out but yes, she was pregnant. I knew the moment I got that text message from him that he "wasn't going to be a dad." So I told my mum and although we didn't know what I meant, we figured it was important to remember I had said it. He texted me on Christmas day to tell me she was having a miscarriage. I fully understand the guilt and I wish I could explain where those feelings come from. I haven't been able to look him in the eye since, for feeling like I caused her to lose the baby. 




 Do some research and post a story letting us know what you find! 




 Next time just drive on your flat. A destroyed rim is better than a dead you. I'm super glad you're okay, just know that you CAN drive on your rim. 




 Are you dead? Did you die in childbirth? 




 Yeah I was just about to lean out the window and have a smoke... thanks for helping me cut back OP. 




 Technically until all of the "remnants" are expelled, you are still pregnant. Also there's that whole baby dies in utero but you have to keep carrying it until labor can be induced thing.  




 Holy.... sh!t. 




 Jerk. 
But also... this was really good.  




 SO what is it then, that makes it so you can't feel pain in your dreams? And how are you getting the wee cuts? I feel like I've missed something and that bothers me 'cause I'm covered in the damn things all the time. I just chalk it up to sharing a bed with a grouchy black cat and a 30lb border collie with no concept of personal space. But it still bothers me. 




 I am never ever ever ever ever going to play laser tag ever as long as I live. 




 Light bulb shaped, with cat eyes. So... alien?
The questions I have... You must have twice as many. 




 Keep us updated. I wish I had the answers. Tell her to wear or carry a piece of sterling silver on her when she's working. 




 Well that's strange. Keep us updated, yeah?  




 No problem. I'm basically the stain master around here. I can get anything out of anything. ;) 




 Am a Ma'am. :) 




 This. 
There's some really good ones on here tonight! 




 Friggin' amazing. 




 Peroxide is great for blood stains. Corn starch for anything oily. Maybe consider getting a van or having a room in a house that you can cover in plastic and keep clean.  




 A: Against /nosleep rules.
B: What are you doing here in the first place?
C: You're a jerk. Get off our sub. 




 Put a salt circle around your bed. Keep us updated. 




 Try editing it. This seems to happen a lot lately. 




 Burn the doll. 




 Well okay then I'm totally down for a visit. :) 




 Have you ever been on /nosleep before? 




 I'd love to come visit but not if I'm gonna end up in the cistern. 




 Holy crap.
