 This is the worst assignment we've ever been on 









 MR. PRESIDENT! 




 YES! Take that, Bitterman! 




  I'm no pirate, but if publishers want to be assholes they can get fucked.

Fine by me. Developers think publishers are assholes too. That's they're job - they need to be ruthless in this market. Publishers are business men and marketers. They're not gamers. They don't care if the game is good, as long as it makes money.

The blame often gets shifted to the devs. While sometimes that blame is due, how can a developer make a great game when they're expected to produce Call of Duty # every 12 months?

 Basically: go fuck yourself if you are a dick. If not, and you don't make shit overpriced games, I'll give you my support.

Yes exactly. This is what I mean by "vote with your wallet." If you like a developer and like their game, buy it. Otherwise, move on. 




  I still want to play their games....so....

**TOO.**

**FUCKING.**

**BAD.**

You entitled little shit. It's not water. It's not air. It's not civil rights or freedom of speech. It's not something you get due to your very dignity of being a human being.

**IT'S A FUCKING VIDEO GAME.** It's a luxury the VAST VAST majority of people cannot even afford. Yet you feel you have the GOD-GIVEN RIGHT to PIRATE games, made with sweat, and tears and excessive amount of espresso? Give me a fucking break.

And fuck the twat that upvoted you. 




 Can I have one? 




 Picture looks like Neuromancer concept art 




 You can skip the weapon/appearance DLCs. While none of the DLCs are essential to getting the full story, I suggest checking out our sidebar to see which ones are the best. 




 Don't be a fucking asshole. Only fucking assholes pirate. I'm a game dev myself and piracy pisses me the fuck off. If it's too expensive for you, don't buy that shit. Vote with your wallet. Don't be a fucking asshole.

Sorry for the number of swears but piracy really pisses me off. 




 My monitor can go up to 2560x1440 




 Hey man, used to work at Staples in their tech sales and EasyCare department (where we fix people's computers). Now I work in the games industry.

For that kind of price you're much better off building your own gaming PC. For $900 you can build one hell of a gaming computer with an i5 and 290 or maybe GTX 970. That laptop has an i7 which is completely useless for solely gaming. i7's are designed to take on anything; unless you are doing video editing, 3d modelling or other high-end stuff, just go with a lower-priced i5 that will give you the exact same performance in gaming.

The main thing is the 730M GPU on that. It sucks, plain and simple. Good luck getting a decent framerate from ESO on low.

Another thing is that laptop has 1TB of HDD. While 1TB is a lot, you want to get ESO and Windows running on an SSD for WAY faster boot times. A HDD takes a couple minutes to boot, while an SSD takes about 10 seconds. Laptop manufacturers get away with putting cheap Seagate or Western Digital drives in laptops, as most people think "Wow, 1TB, so big!" When really, you can buy an internal 1TB HDD for around $30.

8GB of RAM is plenty. ESO does not use more than 4-6GB of RAM, even on my 1440p, ultra settings setup. Again, unless you're doing 3D modelling or video editing, 8GB is more than enough. I am a game developer, so I need 16GB in my PC.

The 15.6" screen is going to hurt after a while - you will get back strain and eye strain after looking at something so small. Take it from me, as I used to solely game on an ASUS 17" laptop (which is even bigger than yours). Once I moved to an actual desktop with a 27" 1440p monitor, I can never go back.

This build will destroy any game you throw at it. It will run ESO at 60FPS, 1080p, max settings very easily. And it's cheaper than your laptop. 

If you really need something on-the-go, just buy a cheap tablet on sale to access email and stuff. You're saving money with this build anyways. 




 What are you talking about? I see a massive drop in quality from errain's screenshots. I run at 2560x1440 and even going down to regular 1080p I see a big drop in image quality. 




 I am getting very bad lag and frequent disconnects, so it may be server-side thing 




 Mass Effect, with all DLC. Why? It gets "role-play" the best for a single-player game IMO. You really are Commander Shepard, warts and all. You get angry, happy, sad, depressed and joyful over the three games. The characters you interact with seem real and the stakes of your adventure, high. I have never been so attached to a virtual game character than I have in Mass Effect. 




 Lunch lady Dorris, have ye got any grease? 









 Don't touch my stuff!...Hey, this isn't the YMCA. 




 Homeless man - Mailbox 




 Mmmm *falls through asphalt hole*....WOW...BART! 









 I doubt the artists involved wanted to do that, but due to Ubishit's time constraints, they have to push out a new game everywhere. There's only so much you can do in 12 months.

I am in modelling and character design myself; I could not stand to copy+paste a model in a scene, but when you're on a limited time budget, you gotta keep going to get deadlines. 




 Won't regret that in 60 years 




 I had not considered that, so fair point. 




 I had not considered that, so fair point. 




 confirmed 




 Or a stupid Shepard who just happens to get things done out of sheer luck. Never lead a team, never put yourself into harms way. When Miranda says "In theory, any biotic could handle it," make her do the biotic barrier. When Jacob volunteers for the vent, let him do it. Always let someone else lead. If you do need to make a choice, make an ill-informed one by tossing a coin.

Or you could play as a xenophobic Shepard. Never recruit aliens if possible. Never do alien loyalty missions, and try to get them killed. Be Paragon to all humans and Renegade to all aliens. 




 I just finished my complete DLC playthrough two days ago and I know exactly how you feel. I haven't even played any other games since finishing ME3...they all feel so inadequate (they're not, I'm just in post-Reaper melancholy).

It's like finishing a very good book, or television show. You invested so much time into the characters, world and story that you don't want it to end. Then you get sucked back into boring reality.

If you want another dose of glorious escapism, check out Dragon Age! 




 I am really hoping BioWare goes back to their roots from ME1 - a grand-scale, sci-fi golden age kind of plot. Big ideas, fairly science-based, and megastructures (oh baby, love dem halos and dyson spheres). Instead, it was changed into a modern-day action shooter. The new Star Trek movies, while okay on their own, did the same thing. 




 Couldn't have said it better myself. Well put. 




  it ran worse on my PC with everything on medium/low, despite me being able to max Inquisition and maintain 60FPS, though I can sort of forgive it due to its age, this happens a lot with older games.

Sounds like a driver issue. My 970 gives me almost 150 FPS in DAO while I get around 50 in DAI @ 1440p 




 On board with you enjoying DA2 the most - I was engrossed in both characters and story in DA2 more than DAO. I dislike DAI, so I won't even mention it here.

To me, DA2 felt like it had the most fleshed out characters, each with their own realistic back story. You were this group of ragtag misfits in a city going through sweeping societal changes. On top of your companions, the main plot was unique among gaming - it was the story of a city, a populace, rather than some hero killing everything in sight. It felt like a true epic, a game version of Les Miserables or Tale of Two Cities. 

Knight-Commander Meredith was an *awesome* character. Her writing, voice acting, motivations; her entire character was well done. I have yet to meet a more interesting character in Dragon Age. 




 I can believe DAI has a very high word count, as you have the main plot, the hundreds of quests and then almost 6 hours of party banter on top of that. And that's just voice acting. If we add in Codex entries, quest text and other written stuff...yeah DAI has a lot of writing.

But don't use "lines" when discussing writing. A line is arbitrary, based solely on the format the work is provided in. I have a big churchy-style KJV Bible and a little one for travel, then an even smaller (horizontally) one on my phone. The word count is the same across all 3, but the number of lines changes. 




 Shamalamalan quality twist 




 Well since you cannot provide an actual source, i.e. a link or video, I drummed this [infographic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BGJpxZ2CQAAd2oN.jpg) up.

It says BI had 20k more *words* than an average novel, not pages. 20,000 pages is absolutely ridiculous, if not inhuman.

In comparison, the King James Bible has just under 2,000 pages with about 788,000 words.

 [Some classics are around 50-90k words](https://indefeasible.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/great-novels-and-word-count/), with some longer books being up to 175k. Let's say BI had 200k words. It still cannot beat a monster like Atlas Shrugged or War and Peace. 




 They can easily drum up new conflicts. Keep in mind the entire series has only been set in the Milky Way. Even Star Wars had an extra-galactic [threat.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong)

I hope they expand more on the dark matter and biotic stuff Drew and the ME1 team were going towards. 




  what keep them from enslaving the galaxy?

If you didn't choose Destroy, get the Reapers to bomb Leviathan out of existence. 




  I'd prefer a sequel with a smaller scale story. But I trust BioWare.

I am all for the smaller story; I'd love a BioWare game with a very small cast (10 main/supporting characters) that have very fleshed out personalities and histories. Then you throw those characters into a personal, emotionally realistic and trying story for a great character-driven space "drama." 

But with the way DAI went, I am semi-pessimistic we'll get another Baldur's Gate clone (big bad, assemble team, do missions, kill bad). 




  Reapers are powerful, they can prevent every single intra-galactic war just by their very presence. It's easier to include geth/quarians, genophage consequences without having to drastically change the plot than including Reapers as guardians.

You can still get away with the Destroy ending - in lieu of the Reapers, the Council makes the Spectres a post-Reaper peacekeeping force. Or everyone is more happy with the Destroy ending so we don't have intergalactic war.

I think BioWare is going to go where the other games did not, or barely touched upon. There was a ton of background lore on biotics, dark matter and the sort that we never really delved into. I hope we see more of the galaxy since there are *billions and billions* of stars out there. Maybe a visit to the galactic core, or even another galaxy? 




 Many are saying here that BioWare wrote themselves into a hole with the 3 different endings. I disagree; I think if you managed to import saves into ME4, either through a "Mass Effect Keep" or a direct import system, you can still make a plot that doesn't stray much depending on Green/Red/Blue ending.

Here's how I would do it:

Red: This is easy. Allied races rebuild everything afterward. AIs are offline for a bit, but are eventually repaired as well with more checks and balances (e.g. Asimov's laws).

Blue: Again, easier than Synthesis. Shepard's makes the Reapers move to another reclusive part of the galaxy in order to avoid further hostility (who would want to live near a Reaper?). Everything else is rebuilt, like in Destroy.

Green: Probably the most difficult to write, but it can be done. The actual level of "synthesis" was never fully explained in ME3. Did organics just get nano-like implants, ala Deus Ex? Or is it so extensive, does everyone speak telepathically now as a collective "mind-hive"? If everyone were a demi-god AI/organic hybrid, you might as well make an entirely different game series set in the far, far future. However, if we take the former approach of "less" synthesis, it can still be done. You just cannot center ME4-6's plot around the organics vs. synthetics theme in ME1-3. Make it about something else, where it does not really matter if everyone has these neural implants. Sure AIs can empathize now and organics can interface with computers, but we've seen these tropes before in other sci-fi (e.g. Deus Ex, The Matrix, Neuromancer).

The skill of BioWare's writers will definitely be tested. They will need to get creative, as to differentiate itself from the other 3 games and not upset fans.

We're going into a post-Reaper galaxy; changing political and socioeconomic structures, highly advanced technology, and (hopefully) greater galactic cooperation. I would not be surprised if we saw more expansion on biotic research, or extra-galactic exploration/colonisation. Maybe an extra-galactic threat from Andromeda?

For now, I'm content with my own fanfic ME4 trilogy; a story about a highly advanced "immortal being" playing with human biotic potential in a bid to stop the death of the universe. 




 Got a source for that Bioshock Infinite thing? That sounds way, way too much. 




 Dude who just moved here too - been listening to Danny for years but have never gotten the chance to see him live. Would like to go with someone 




 No. 




 Clickbait at its worse. Who cares. 




 Didnt enjoy the story as much. Felt like a big DLC or companion novel instead of a worthy addition to the human-covenant-halo conflict (which is what Halo 1-3 was centered around). 




 He's been in a bunch of ads and in a major video game trilogy. I'd say he is doing all right compared to your average actor. 




 Deus Ex , Halo 1-3, and the game I am working on! 




 DAI is an unoptimized console port on PC. Hopefully BioWare will be more familiar with the engine for ME4. 




 Homer loves Flanders 




 He's gaining on us, go faster! 




 Then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge!

You don't get these faces with the new animation :( 




 Nothing can compare to the imagination of a small boy. 




 It doesnt matter. 




 I'll make sure I get a better repost next time 




 I would have never thought of that. 




 Son, if somethings too hard to do its not worth doing. 




 I hope in the next ME we get more realistic romances, rather than this hero worship "pick the flirt option 10x to unlock sex scene" kind of fluff.

Romancing Cassandra in Dragon Age does not give me much confidence that romance will evolve in ME4 




 How are you finding Warlords? 




 *I should go.* 




 I've done every LI except Cortez and Tali. While Liara had the most content and is likely BioWare's canon love interest, Jack felt the least hero worship to me. Even Liara practically throws herself at you in ME1. 




 doh 









 What did you guys like so much about Arkham? I was never a huge superhero fan, so even after beating AA, I didn't get the hype. Haven't bothered playing AC yet. 




 Please put all your screencaps into one album, rather than uploading them all separately. 




 Dear friends,

I had the privilege to do my first complete DLC-included playthrough over this past Christmas break. Beforehand I've only ever played Mass Effect when I bought it, with or without DLC. I'll spare the details, but I had a very challenging 2014 and was very down in the dumps. 2015 is shaping up to be much better.

I am kicking off my "new year" (7 days later), with the completion of Mass Effect 3. I played a Captain Kirk-like (paragade) man-shep, romanced Liara in ME1 then, for a change, did Jack in 2/3. Jack is an awesome LI, if you have not tried with her already.

Anyways, I finished ME3's final mission tonight after doing the "energetic" Citadel party. After I chose the [green ending](/spoiler), I was still feeling a bit down when the credits rolled (which I played M4 Faunts overtop) and rebooted my save.

I played the entire party again as the quiet version. In my head, [this was heaven for Shepard after he died at the end of Synthesis.](/spoiler) Just kicking back with friends. What a perfect ending to the trilogy with Shep's whispered line "The best..."

Thank you BioWare for keeping me company over the Christmas break, and creating the best game series I've ever played. Here's hoping Mass Effect 4 is even better. 




 They do have hair physics - watch Morrigan's hair in any conversation and it's quite easy to spot 




 Because creating realistic hair that moves with the physics engine (Havoc, in DAI's case) is very difficult. Look at Tomb Raider 2013 - they had that special TressFX hair and it still looked really wispy. Even in photorealistic CGI hair still looks off.

What most developers do is put on a heavy layer of post-processing on hair or fur. If you've played Far Cry 3/4 or Lost Planet, it is very evident. 




 Care to expand? I don't enjoy the combat, as it's spammy, boring and MMO-esque. The animations and effects were pretty, but it's a pain to go through (especially that 3 hour boss fight at the end). 




 It's not due to consumer interest - it's because your subreddit was linked on /r/games and /r/subredditdrama over fanboy Dominoid's post 




 I've got about 100 hours in on my Deluxe copy. It was okay the first couple times to 50, but it gets old fast. The lore is a pretty dull affair and I don't remember any of the characters except the green hologram dude. 




 That's generally the phenomena with most games - the ones online are either disgruntled customers or rabid fanboys. The normal folk just enjoy the game. 




 They're meaningless, arbitrary awards from a random games website. They can give Dolphin Simulator 2014 best MMO and it doesn't change anything. Who fucking cares.
 




 Then you don't give an award that year, which is exactly what Massively did 




 When you pay $60+ then 15/month on top, then another $15 to get a fucking mount, you're going to defend a shitty purchase.

Just look at assholes like /u/T-Husky in this very subreddit.

ESO has a notoriously wank fanbase. Far worse than any MMO ive played. 




 RemindMe! 6 months

Edit as of jan21: hahahahahahahah. Fuckin right.

Edit 2 as of July 2015: ;) 




 You must be flip. Only flips complain about flips 




 Report, ignore and move on 




 Sarcasm? 




 The best thing in the genre was a mediocre expansion for a decade-old theme park mmo 




 Reapers got blown up. Relays rebuilt along with EDI. Geth in the process. Shepard survives, but is so distraught over his journey, he buys a small cabin on a far away colony to live in peace. He takes up drinking as a hobby and has severe post-traumatic stress disorder. His LI either died or doesn't know where Shepard went. 




 Most of the Elder Scrolls games do this fairly well. You may also want to check out Divinity; Original Sin 




 I don't know - the rest of the game writing is fairly good, as good as any Mass Effect (Citadel is awesome). It's mainly the Cerberus parts I have a problem with. I think it's something to do with games in general - they needed a "human" enemy for the player to kill, rather than just Reaper husks of the various races for 45 hours straight.

It was the same in ME2 - where did all the mercenary groups recruit hundreds and hundreds of brain-dead drones to fight Shepard? 




  I love the game,

I'm confused; you list several major cons with the game, but love it? 

Is it just me or do we overuse "love" in regards to products? 




 I think KOTOR1 was better; KOTOR2, unless you have a third-party mod, is a buggy mess with a terrible ending. 




 I got about 75% through DAI, got so bored I started another ME playthrough. Almost done ME3 and haven't even touched DAI since before Christmas

I bought Alpha Protocol and KOTOR1 like yourself, looking forward to them 




 Other than Hawke's inclusion being fanfic-y, I agree with you on every point. 




 I think DAI is a boring, MMO-esque grindfest for power level. 

But to each their own. Got about 35 hours in, third last mission and haven't touched it since before Christmas. 




 I am doing my second playthrough of ME3. I forgot how terrible some of the writing and plot holes are, but the biggest one is really glaring.

Why is Cerberus this massive force with unlimited soldiers, when in ME2 they were a small survivalist group? Why is Martin Sheen going on the all-out offensive, when before he used small squad tactics to capture highly valuable material? Why is Cerberus on Tuchanka? Why are they at Grissom Academy? Why are they on Sur'Kesh? Why are they fighting me more than the Reapers?

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. Outside of Cerberus/TIM/Kai Leng (god he is fucking awful), the writing is fairly good. 




 If possible, try to use a flatter, wider nose. 




 Money. I wish they wrote his character better in ME3 too - he's such a [talented](http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/movie/movie_poster/apocalypse-now-1979/large_xytHTHqtQlXtzyJTtlqnVjvDdqd.jpg) [actor](http://i37.tinypic.com/68g410.jpg), they could have done so much more with him. 




 An MMO should do one of two things - be honest and blatantly copy World of Warcraft, knowing full well it will never succeed World of Warcraft (WoW) - or create a sandbox where the players create the content (EVE Online). SWTOR, BioWare and EA foolishly thought to take on WoW's throne and they couldn't even make it up the first step before crashing and burning. All they made was WoW, with single-player KOTOR stories and some *okay* (IIRC) 16-player raids. They could have easily just created a Destiny-like game, or something akin to Borderlands; a story-driven game with player choice and some co-op.

BioWare could have easily created KOTOR with some multiplayer elements with the budget put into SWTOR. In fact, SWTOR was so bloody expensive [(estimates at $200mil+)](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-cost-200-million-to-develop/1100-6348959/), they could have made a single-player KOTOR so vast, so epic in scope, it could have been their magnum opus. I think it was EA's interference that spurred the creation of SWTOR; they saw how successful Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade were (the current xpacs at the time of development), and said "wow, people love star wars, let's just use WoW's formula and add Star Wars." Where have we heard that before, just in the last year with another popular single-player franchise?

From a game design and innovation perspective, most MMOs today are drastically outdated. Every single one is just copying Everquest's formula, World of Warcraft included. The only exception I can think of that takes full advantage of the massively-multiplayer environment is EVE Online, where by players run the economy and political structures in the game. 

We can argue that most games are built off previous games, as nothing is inherently "original." BioWare has essentially been remaking Baldur's Gate for the past 17 years. But that is what they're good at - creating interesting *character-driven, single-player* experiences. Not MMOs.
The MMO genre has been stale since 2004 - the year when WoW released and EVE was celebrating a 1-year anniversary. Unless you enjoy WoW, there is literally nothing else to play that is inherently different except EVE Online. Why would you play SWTOR, or EQ2, or ESO, or Age of Conan? They're all World of Warcraft, with some twists here and there, but they all fail to live up to WoW's amount of content, class balance, lore or player base.  




 The reversal of the Reapers from this enigmatic, god-like space cthulu machine race into loltripods from War of the Worlds.

ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL

I KNOW YOU FEEL THIS

BRMMMMMMM

Give me a fucking break. 




 So Mass Effect Galaxies? 




 Its got 8 self-contained stories that do not need any help from other players.

Why did they make an MMO again? 




 Probably wouldn't have Martin Sheen as a voice actor 




 I can see ESO nurtures a very mature, helpful community. This subreddit was toxic at release and is still shit now. Enjoy your shit game folks - I'll save this post and come back in 6 months when it goes F2P.*

*they removed 6 month sub options. why the fuck would they do this if they were NOT planning on going F2P?

Jan21 edit: http://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-drops-subscription/

Motherfuckers. Dam right 




 Wtf 




 How can it be anything but [M4 Part II by Faunts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKiOcV1SSc)

Halo and Journey have the best soundtracks though 




 Good luck getting to 120FPS @ 1440p for any recent AAA titles, unless you SLI 970s or something 




 It's rumored to be going F2P in a few months, so wait. 




 wtf? Did EA or Ubisoft go down or something? What is this shit, OP? 




 Now buy a QNIX for WQHD 




 If they were, they wouldn't still be in business.

blah blah, Ubisoft, blah blah. IIRC, many, many people bought Far Cry 3 and 4 and enjoyed it.
