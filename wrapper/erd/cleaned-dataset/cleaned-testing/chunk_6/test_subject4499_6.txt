 Whaaaat? Really? How much? 




 I think that sums it up then. 




 There is one film that can make me weep like a baby no matter when I watch it or who is around. That movie is [Awakenings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099077/), and now that Robin is gone, I fear that movie will be so incredibly sad, that I could not bare it. I fucking loved Robin Williams as an actor, what a fucking tragedy.

EDIT: sorry for cursing. 




 I just fired up the episode, and yeah it's definitely "won't". 




 Amazing episode. 









 Riviere?


Going to be hard trying not to scare old people. 









 What if you eventually become a homeless Alzheimer's patient?  




 I'm pretty sure they did yeah. 




 Message this guy and ask for pictures of the discs and make sure they aren't in terrible shape.

 Man, I bought all 5, and would never dream of selling them. Crazy to see the collection go for that price. 




 Not sure if the opiates are available unsigned? 




 How much are you willing to spend? 




 Would she be allowed to walk under the table that only has two legs in the background? 




 Zoinks! 




 Did you sell it to a guy for 40 bucks? Because I bought mine for 40 bucks from a guy who thought weed was better than tool. 




 Fucking yes they're coming to Calgary. Thank you. 




 Facebook is blocked at work, can someone copy/paste dates in thread? 




 Where obtain? 




 Agreed. Broken city is awesome, but holy fuck is it small. 









 Might take the trip to Edmonton the next night. I see no other choice. 




 I know this might be a long shot, but I'm trying to find myself a ticket to the sold out Misery Signals show next month. I cannot believe I missed the sale by this much.

Again, I know this is a stretch, but thought it might be worth a shot. Please let me know if you have a spare ticket for sale, thanks!

 I have a fetish for understanding, it gets me off sooo hard. 




 There seems to be a different fetish question on the front page every week, what gives?

 I am across the lake in the little white house (base of the waterfall).  




 Right? The outro to that song is amazing. 




 Thank you, I thought so too. Also, I quickly dug up this portfolio, there are soooo many to choose from. 









 That is awesome. 




 Dude.. 




 Man, cemetery gates? Are you kidding me?  




 The great southern trendkill is a fucking beast of an album. That was the one that originally got me into pantera. 




 I can't imagine anyone else on earth doing vocals for pantera besides Phil. 




 Agreed. 




 Daaaaaamn, how have I not noticed this for the past 20 years? 




 I would eat this. 




 I too am having a Pantera kind of day. \m/ 









 Pretty sure that's a Metallica shirt.  




 Agreed. 




 This is fucking brilliant. 









 The artist may have turned out to be a mooch, but I don't regret my ocular orifice in the least. 




 Nice, thanks for this. I was wondering how that happened. 









 You should definitely post this in /r/bobsburgers. Nice work. 




 The imgur URL reads "how the fuck" to me. 









 It's r/Calgary, never comment here. 




 I remember the controversy that surrounded the band in the media due to their electronic style shift, I was very intrigued. 

I received the album from my brother as a gift on my 18th birthday. The night I got it in the mail I had plans to hike to my friends cabin, as we usually did with whatever free time we had. I didn't go anywhere without my discman and a few albums. Of course I brought this one along with me and played it on a continuous loop for the entire trip. It was how our hikes usually were, especially during the cold winter nights when there wasn't much point in talking over the wind, better off keeping your head down and conserving energy.

This story is becoming more of a nostalgia trip for me than anything else, I apologize. Anyways, I'll never forget the moment we got off the main road and headed into the thick bush during the pitch black of the night, and snow falling like crazy. I fire up track one, everything in its right place, and it ended up being one of the most memorable music moments I have, and it sticks with me more than any concert I have ever been to. I instantly fell in love with Kid A, and listened to it on repeat for weeks, if not months. 

I'm not sure if it was the pitch black forest, trudging through powdered snow that was still falling through the beam of my flashlight that made the moment so goddamn perfect for that album, or if it was the album that made that moment so goddamn perfect. Whatever it was, it is and probably always will be my favorite Radiohead album.

Good times.

EDIT: I don't think this qualifies me as "old", but I remember it clearly so I thought I'd chime in. Or maybe that's me denying the fact I'm quickly getting old. 




 Hi. 




 No worries, good luck! 




 My experience with this site tells me it'll be back up again within the next couple months. Once you register you'll receive emails telling you what their daily sales are. That's your best bet. 




 $50.99 CAD. 




 *Thief 









 Thanks for the reply, I'll keep an ear to the ground. Keep up the good work. 




 Sweet jesus I hope I'm not too late. I love your work Ben, seriously. It's awesome. That is all.

EDIT: Almost forgot, any plans for more touring? Specifically western canada? 




 Fever ray is so awesome, so glad to hear Adam is listening to her.

Good introduction for those of you that like experimental/electronic.

 Oh yes by, right haun man! Magine. 




 First the Newfoundlanders wipe out the indigenous people of the island, and now aliens? Sweet Jesus what a bunch of savages. 




 Good ol dump bears. 




 When you're from there yeah. 




 "North" American at least. 




 Quebec is worse. 




 I just submitted an update. 




 **UPDATE**

Friend got back to me, didn't call the police, found this in the same area.

[http://i.imgur.com/dbRGeGd.png](http://i.imgur.com/dbRGeGd.png) 




 There are no reliable estimates of the total black bear population in North America because of the animals secretive nature, but populations are believed to be about 600,000, with more than 380,000 in Canada. *Population numbers in Newfoundland and Labrador are estimated at 6,000 to 10,000 bears.*

**FTFY** 




 You obviously haven't hung out at the dump enough. 




 I'm going to lean towards this explanation. Perhaps the limb in the photo is either charred and/or rotten. 




 Yeah, I found it rather creepy myself. 




 Friend went back to Newfoundland, stumbled upon this grizzly sight. He texts me, I say "wtf", then "call the cops". Still waiting to hear back. 




 Not sure. I told him to call the cops. I'm still trying to figure out whether or not it is in fact human. There are black bears all over the island. Was hoping someone could help identify. 




 That's what I asked. No response yet. 









 Where obtain? 




 Literally my all time favorite movie. Thanks for these, they look great. 




 Yeah you're probably right. Glad to know there are more albini fans around, people never know who I'm talking about. 




 Can someone explain to me how the average post in a sub with 2311042 subscribers only manages to top out with 10 upvotes? 




 I would enjoy this. 




 I'd be interested in hearing tool work with [Steve Albini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini). 




 ~~covered in crickets~~ 




 SHAYE LIVES!?!!? 




 I too like Palms more than Crosses. 




 Me too! 




 To be honest, I'm digging the more upbeat sound of the new album for that reason. I usually listen to heavy prog for the most part, so albums like these are a nice break in between. This is of course when I'm not listening to "Get Lucky" on repeat at my 2 year old's request. 




 I think it's a little more prog than other deftone related projects, could that be why?  




 Me too. 




 Different strokes for different folks I guess. Saw them live last year I believe it was, and it was so awesome, especially when they broke out Leviathan material. 

It's funny because back in 2003/04 which ever it was, I was browsing a local record store for new music (didn't have a computer or internet at the time), and the cover for Leviathan jumped out at me from across the store. Best impulse buy ever. 




 [Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Palms/comments/2a5ysg/shortwave_radio/) 









 That was my initial reaction as well, have had it on repeat for two days now and the more I listen the more I love. Taking a quick Palms break at the moment but will have it on again momentarily. 




 This new album would be a good place to start. 




 Leviathan is definitely my #1 as well, this may overtake it with time. 




 Exactly, I'm with you. 




 Yeah my bad, the album artwork is pretty awesome. Thanks for linking. 




 I know this isn't tool related what so ever, but they have opened for them. I thought due to the lack of tool news/content we could discuss related topics. Mods please delete if you feel this doesn't belong here.

I'm just really enjoying "Once More 'Round The Sun", and figured there would be like minded people around these parts. 




 Ah, I see. Seems legit. 




 According to who? 




 I would, but if I parked there overnight I can almost guarantee that I would end up getting a ticket and/or towed. Seems like the parking authority only allows assholes to pull this kind of crap, as long as it's consistent. I like the passive aggressive note under the windshield, or maybe even a chalk outline marking "asshole parking". 

EDIT: I forgot I had this, perhaps I should print a couple. [http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png](http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png) 




 Not yet, was thinking about kicking his muffler off first, and see if that works. 




 I laughed. 




 Hi. 




 I've brought it up with the board, and they will "look into it". Another issue I have with this is, this is our shared visitors lot with "NO OVERNIGHT PARKING". Not sure if you can see it on the sign or not but yeah. The absolute gull of some people. The only time it really becomes an inconvenience is the weekends when parking is scarce, so I try my hardest to look the other way throughout the week, but find it really hard as I pass by him everyday. Thanks for the idea.  




 I'm not a mod sorry. 




 Good eye. 




 It's just faded is all, if the Internet requires further proof, I will atain said proof, simply because you've been my best friend for 20 years.

EDIT:  Took this picture on my way to work this morning, wasn't meant to be the proof I promised but if you look over you can see the one faded line in question.

 Shaving weeks off my life as I type this. 




 Nope, that is definitely two spaces. All three pictures were taken in the same lot, and you can see that they're singles in the other pictures. 




 He's perfectly square between two spaces? Meaning he *should* be capable of parking square in one space? 









 Will do. Thanks again. 




 Thank you very much for this. My amp doesn't have a preamp so I assume if I went with the higher end I would need to pick one up. 




 Newbie to the audiophile world. Looking to invest in a turntable setup, and was wondering if my current [Onkyo TX-NR609](http://www.eu.onkyo.com/en/products/tx-nr609-35517.html) receiver would be sufficient. Not only am I very happy with its sound (I play 320 kbps MP3's through a PS3) but I am restricted for space in my man cave, investing in a separate receiver would be a challenge. 

What would be a decent beginner turntable setup, and how could I operate it through my current receiver? I'd like to keep my budget around the $500 CAD mark, but as always, am willing to weigh my options.

Thanks. 




 I really liked the live suggestion made by /u/sowr in my original post. The idea that their performance art currently best represents the band really stuck with me. It's a theme of its own when you think about it, a theme which is most relevant. 

Again I will reiterate that I am no photoshop expert, and there are probably many around here better suited for the task.
I would just really like to see a change from what we currently have.

EDIT: TL;DR The live tool experience best represents the band in my opinion.

 Would you be open to this? Should I submit it and see what everyone thinks?

 Oh me either, don't get me wrong. Wasn't trying to slag the post, I genuinely enjoy posts speculating about new material. It's kind of like wondering what the presents under your Christmas tree are as a kid. 




 As sad as it is, I look forward to these kinds of posts whist waiting for the new album/project/DVD/Blu-Ray/vinyl/hologram/musical underware or whatever it is they're building in there. It's a nice reminder that *something* is happening. 




 Coincidental to find worms Armageddon content here, I just installed that game yesterday and played a few matches for the first time since 2003.

 Thank you.

I should really bust out my SLR and take some nice shots of it. I put a lot of blood sweat and tears into its development (along with a lot of help from good friends). 




 Haha yeah that's the one. Even the background music wasn't tool, garbage. 




 Ah yes, this makes more sense.
