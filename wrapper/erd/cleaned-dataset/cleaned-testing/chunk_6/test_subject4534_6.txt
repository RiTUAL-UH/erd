 rdio.com, I'm switching to google play though. If I like an album enough I buy it off iTunes. And if I like the artist enough I actually buy the CD. 




 A friend actually did this. I thought it was insanely crazy/creepy at the time but he's one of those guys that just says "Fuck it" and does whatever he feels is right. He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised. 




 Do women have different protein requirements than men? I took some whey protein powder from my brother in law until I get my own. But my friend tells me I need to go to a professional to find out what exactly protein I need. He mentioned protein shakes made specifically for women?

 




 I liked Kiss Me. Saw it on Netflix. Imagine Me and You is good as well. 




 Confidence and hobbies. I think looks (either eyes, body, whatever) can draw a person in but it's personality or choices they make that can make them attractive. The most attractive girl I ever met was cute but what made her so hot was that she was very confident, super friendly, ambitious, and she had various hobbies like cross country skiing. 




 I would probably say Kristen Stewart. I only saw Snow White and the Huntsman just for her. 




 I feel like my depression comes in waves. I think of it as a cycle in which I go through good periods of productivity and socialization and other times when I think life is completely pointless and why should I even bother getting out of my bed. I kind of get what you mean. 




 Bride Wars. I kept expecting Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway to admit they loved each other and get married. 




 I don't think it's forward or weird at all. I've actually gone a step further and pretty much grabbed one girls hand and wrote my number on it. We were good friends until we moved to different cities. 




 I love Little Big Town but since they switched producers on their last album and decided to chase hit singles they've been kind of meh to me. I see this as another attention grab by them. 




 Oh wow, thanks for the song suggestions. I have some listening to do! 




 I've been thinking about songs like "Wide Open Spaces" and "New Strings" which made me also think of songs like "Long Time Gone" where someone leaves their hometown only to realize how good it was back home. Are there any more songs of leaving home only to miss home and/or coming back? 




 In a perfect world Miranda Lambert would win every country award. 




 I hope you told her. I've actually told two of my female crushes how I felt about them. One of them was flattered but straight, and the other was asexual and not interested in starting anything but still remains my friend to this day. I really don't regret telling them. 




 I keep his toys out so he can play with them whenever he wants so I guess i'll try putting them away so he doesn't get tired of them. Play before mealtime sounds like a good idea. He's not declawed. 




 It seems that way. I've started to divert his attention by grabbing his lure toy when he starts to become aggressively playful. I just don't want him to think it's okay to try to bite and scratch my arms or legs when he's like this. 




 LOL don't worry I certainly appreciate him, the many cat scratches on my arm tell the story of me constantly petting and hugging him to the point he would get mad.d 




 I take him out everyday and play with him at least two times a day but I guess I'll ramp it up.
