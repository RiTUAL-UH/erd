 God that was awful. 




 QUIT STOMPING ON THAT KNEE YOU NEED IT GOD DAMNIT 




 Mind you, mileage is more to do with miles per gallon or litres per 100km. And 'fuel efficiency' is about the best synonym we've got for that.  




 Range? 




 This league is just so much better with that crazy bastard in it.  




 Fucking gurgley throated announcer... Ugh. 




 There's more: http://vimeo.com/113812673 




 Sir Jonathan Edward Guthmann.

 Nerlens Noel was a big man with injury problems who wasn't going to play his whole rookie season. I think the Cavs thought Bennett might be useful faster - but he buckled like a baby giraffe under the pressure and hasn't looked remotely useful til this year. He's had a few games where he's looked like a bit of a force, he might still prove to be a good pickup for Minnesota. 




 Room noise is part of the buzz for me :( 




 Honda Cb900/919 is the best all-rounder I've ever owned. 




 Did you take that picture in Berlin? I'm pretty sure I got the same one. Flying cocks, gotta love 'em. 




 Either that, or you taped your grandad snoring.  




 I hope they keep ranking him low. I love how much it fires him up. 




 I dunno, I thought the soundtrack was a ripper, but I didn't like the movie at all. Seems about right to me, although I know a lot of people loved it. I guess I'm just not a Coen brothers fan, their style always annoys me. 




 That's a cool trick that toothbrush one.  




 He's working on a bot to do the AMA for him.  




 Well aren't you a ray of sunshine?  




 That's when you do the old wide walk.  




 no na moon ah something sonething doogn doogn 




 Sure, everyone wants to win. It's a matter for the league to address so that genuine competition can be worth watching.  




 Unless you've got money riding on it, it's pure entertainment and nothing more.  




 Ugly basketball.  




 I don't have much to say about the post, but i think i would've experimented with a longer zoom to try to draw out the curve in the path, because that's where my attention goes and it's way off in the distance at the wide angle you've shot with. No use to you but that's what came to mind!  




 Good luck! Mine lasted juuust under 24 hours before one of the motors blew in an altercation with a telephone line. 




 What awesome news! Her "let me try ASMR to you headphones" video was the first one I ever watched, and it still blows my mind. Her accent and speech cadence is just so powerful. Welcome back mate, anyone gives you trouble, you come talk to us. 




 Bombs it like a bad man in 2k.  




 Props to the Spurs there too - full court outlet pass right to the opposite basket and it's STILL a 1-on-2.  




 I love your post work on this. Awesome!  




 It's big in Ireland.  




 I did. Bit of a compulsive game finisher. It got more and more ridiculous until the last mission, which was pure stupidity. Loved it.  




 To be fair, that was a knobbish speech. He doesn't do himself a lot of favors in that regard.  




 /r/cringepics seems to be leaking. 




 That's one sweet cave.  




 I don't know what that is, and I'm gonna keep it that way.  




 It happens to the best of us. 




 Gold! We had a guy suggest "Menial Merriment." He wasn't joking either. 




 That's bizarre... It's just an LED... Will give it a go. 




 I, ah, kinda like facebook. 




 Weird. I've just got a note 4 too. I charge it overnight, and I've had it for nearly a week, and it's totally drained by bedtime every day. Baconreader, Facebook and Chrome, little bit of YouTube here and there and i don't feel like I'm using it all the time. Teach me your secrets.  




 Makes sense in relation to personal attention ASMR.  




 It just gets tiring dealing with a stack of people who all want something from you.  




 She's that good.  




 That white noise one sent me to sleep for about two months.  




 This woman is pure, distilled love and affection. What a sweet soul and a perfect ambassador.  




 That's magnificent.  




 I got a speeding ticket in NZ. The cop apologised profusely and told me if I'd only been 20 over, he'd have let it go... Cost me 60 dollars or something. I wanted to hug the guy. I came home to find a Melbourne hidden camera had caught me for 4 over at 4.30 in the morning, and fined me $180. NZ is the place to be alright! 




 Well that's handy, because it looks like you R1. 




 Went straight to penis. Contents as advertised. 









 That is just a gorgeous jam. 




 I've found their spare parts pricing absolutely terrifying. I ended up making a ZX9 ratbike rather than pay the astronomical price for genuine bits. 




 I just find that a weird way to look at it. Bikes are just stuff, there's good ones and bad ones but it's all about the ride. Getting hung up on one bike or another always seems to lead to bad places when it gets stolen or you stick it in a bush.  




 Angry Barbie! 




 Brutal beauty is best beauty. 




 That slammed bounce pass was a pearler. 




 That's disgraceful. Well done.  




 Yeah but I'd say niggling is less serious than nagging. It's a more playful version of the word.  




 1. Lebron
2. Kevin Durant
3. dick cheeks (my 2k player) 
4. jeremy Lin
5. I'm tired 
6. Metta world peace, what a fuckin stupid name
7. Kanye West, is he a basketballer? 
8. Falls about laughing 
9. There's that knob who runs around trying to intimidate everyone (beats me) 
10. I'm late, screw this  




 Dear person that stole this article wholesale from Gizmag.com, fuck you. At least put a fucking link in.  




 I was pretty amazed.   




 He strikes me as a genuinely stupid man. 




 You're very kind. Here's another I wrote in the same job :

My lebanese wife's shiny locks
Sprout from armpits, back, arms and her box.
Her pubes are so long
And so thick and so strong
That she knits herself into her jocks.

You might think it's strange for a man
To permit so much hair on her can
But it brought us great mirth
At our eldest son's birth;
He came swinging out just like Tarzan.

I'll confess, though, I'm catching the bug;
Even though she's quite ticklish to hug -
And the 'stache on her gash
Sometimes gives me a rash -
It's like rooting a fine persian rug. 




 It seems I've been gilded -  yippee! 

So what does that mean, let me see... 

Well it sounds like a scream 

For the whole reddit team 

But there's bugger all in it for me! 

-----

;)  cheers whoever that was! 

 




 No. Not even a little bit.   




 Here's a 4-stanza mini-epic I threw together on a really boring job site once:

-----

My lesbian friend said "I'm horny, 

But fisting's beginning to bore me. 

With five fingers up it, 

I feel like a Muppet. 

I'm sick of my bitch speaking for me."

-----

I replied "the solution is clear. 

It's penis you're needin' my dear. 

They're built for the job, 

Plus they'll fit in your gob 

And I happen to have one right here!" 

-----

"What luck!" said the lass, "I might screw you. 

I've never been that fond of hoo-hoo; 

A big pair of tits, 

They're my favourite bits, 

And most men ain't got 'em - but YOU do! 

-----

I was slightly offended, but fark it - 

It's not every day I can park it. 

Most girls aren't impressed 

With my man-booby chest 

But it's big in the lesbian market.

 That's some Clyde the Glide level floatage. 




 I think this guy should steer clear of the word 'skynet.'  




 Awesome! This doesn't mean you can't go enjoy food, it just means you don't have to if you don't feel like it, you can just fuel up and get on with your day. 




 Or just using them as marks for the actors. 




 Dear jesus god no no no 




 Speed triple is the best bike in the whole world ever.  




 Why would you want to drag race a middleweight triple with a short wheelbase?  




 Nope.  




 5-year-old me would probably think I've got a pretty cool life. I review motorcycles and travel the world singing... But I can't help wondering what 70-year-old me will think of me, because I have saved fuck-all cash for that guy. 




 It felt a little homoerotic, but hey. All for the cause! 




 Didn't have time to defecate on this one. My wildly puckering anus did munch a decent hole out of the seat leather though. 




 Yeah that's me. It was a flinch. I thought I was a goner.  




 Ah... Hey! That's me! AMA. It's midnight here though so I'll answer tomorrow.  




 Yep. 




 You'll be glad to know Nick wasn't put off by the whole experience. He had a ball on the back...

... Because one ball is about all you can fit on that seat... 




 First two bikes I ever loved were Hondas. I'd just be taking a dump on them because they won't give me bikes to review!  




 Cheers mate! I'm easily bored, so I try to make stuff fun. :) 




 Cheers! A bit of a homage to an old Yamaha video I remember from years and years ago.  




 Honda won't answer my emails... Maybe I should borrow a friend's Honda and take a huge dump on it. 









 Military industrial complex, the one that's been propping up the floundering American economy for decades. 




 Absolutely. I'd buy a Blake Griffin autobiography in a second after reading that.  




 I'm not sure my labrador appreciates food at all either - it's gone in seconds and she's off rooting about in the grass for stray faeces for dessert. 




 Szekaly I think?  




 I use a macbook i7 with 12 gb ram, a thunderbolt external monitor and a bunch of thunderbolt drives. I really like fcpx, it took some getting used to but it's very quick for me now, handles DSLR footage like a champion and it's super fast and responsive. Mind you I only really make Web video, it's probably pitched right at my level.  




 Sums up Wade to me, turns around after the dunk to deliberately step over a guy that wasn't in his way. Tosser. 




 That or Slam Dump.  




 For me, it was two things. Firstly every photo I saw on Flickr that I loved seemed to be coming out of the same camera, a full frame. The crops couldn't seem to keep up with the level of detail in sky and cloud areas. I'm not sure if it's dynamic range or what.

Secondly I'd bought the 24-105 lens after trying it on a full frame and didn't realise it wouldn't go as wide on a crop, so I was a bit of a drongo.

At the end if the day I just don't get the same feeling from shots taken on my 7D as I do with those from the 5D2. I'm very happy with the 5d and you can get em pretty cheap right now.  




 The trouble with wheelying for girls is that by the time you finish the wheelie, you're speeding away from them. So there they stand, wanting desperately to lavish you with hero sex, but not knowing where to post it to. 




 No comment on the gas. I'm taking that as a yes.

...aaaaaand as I type that, you're saying "give yourself good quality air to breathe" in my headphones. :P 




 I sang "this used to be my playground" by Madonna in the delivery room as my son was being born. Midwives and wife were united in their discontent.  




 Wow, yeah. But Danny McAskill and the Isle of skye are both cheat codes! I imagine it's much easier to film slower stuff than quick motorcycles as well.  




 That's some shitty drone footage though, I gotta say.  




 Peak horsepower is one thing, but a supercharged litrebike will smash out some serious torque on the way there. The roadgoing H2 will be fucking quick! 




 Get some of this goodness into ya: unintended asmr - Thai massage instruction: http://youtu.be/7SMnFQH6kNE 




 I'm riding a Gen 1 into the ground as my commuter hack as we speak!  




 That model was notorious for it, yeah. Did you try any of the ivan's gear?  




 Fair enough, I guess we wait and see.  




 I have my doubts that this will fully fix it - so many bikes from so many manufacturers come out with that throttle snatch... The MT09 is among the worst, but it seems to be an accepted part of injected bikes these days. I suspect this will improve it but not eradicate it. 




 Wheel spin seems unlikely.
 




 To each his own, but I've never understood the appeal of these giant twin shock retro nakeds. They feel bargey and awkward to me, compared with the sportier naked bikes, it seems harder to get them to handle and you don't gain that much in comfort. GSX14, CB13, the whole segment just confuses me.  




 That would be the perfect Nique moment to cast in bronze. 




 Almost looks like a blackbird tail too.  




 It will help you get chicks all day bro.  




 I dunno what you mean, but feel free to have a crack at it! 




 If they wanna work that hard, they can have us. There's other reasons too - I used to see learners on forums watching other guys' videos and getting fixated on speedo numbers and going out to the same roads to try to match them. Or have people come on and start pissing contests. Better for everyone to have that number disappear.  




 Plenty of great roads in vic. Do a bunch of miles and work on staying wide on entries for maximum vision. Or head to Broadford and go mad on right handers til they feel great!  




 So many reasons. Mainly because we didn't have german porn.
