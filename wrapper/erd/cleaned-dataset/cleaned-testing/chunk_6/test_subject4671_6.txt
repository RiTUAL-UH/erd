 i didn't see it at all and it wasn't tagged as duplicate :( sorry 









 Today is my day 3. Yesterday I had to catch the gym so i did modified leg day there(max weight squats,max weight deadlifts, bench step ups to backwards lunges).

I'm 5'11 190 lb.s I want to lose lbs so I'm eating at a deficit.  




 you are a scholar and a gentleman. 




 youtube has limitations concerning not allowing sponsors to be shown on stream which makes it not very feasible. 

you can read more about it at FXOBoss's blog:

 can someone plz paste the text for those of us with the LOL site blocked? 




 he's talking about the hints that have been bandied around of EG signing form CLG.EU 




 what happened in the JD match...I left after he held the initial nydus assuming he would win 




 these are heart of the swarm beta codes :) 




 doesn't the meal plan have you slightly increase your amount of calories for phase 2? 




 the supplements are soo expensive bc its really the only way they can sustain a business. Similar to razors/razor blades..you only really need 1 workout regimen(although i will vouch for p90x, insanity, and body beast all being good workout routines)  




 since its part of a scam/pyramid scheme i stayed far away from it. Also since it doesn't have to be approved by the fda..its basically doesn't have to have any affects. also if you search shakeology scam on google you'll see its literally literred with beachbody coaches with a copy/paste page sayings its not which hides the real research done on it to say it is a scam

tl:dr shakeology is a scam..you are better with a cheaper protien shake 




 GomTvT was more a part of the format of GSL then anything to do with exceptional terran strength 




 well he is somebody now :P I think the main problem is both of them are more play by play casters...it would be like tasteless and totalbiscuit casting together..they would miss a lot 




 the other guy is robin and he won their caster contest. part of the prize for winning was getting to cast a semi final.  




 i havent found one so far.. sorry :( 




 there are 3 starcraft streams and 2 Lol streams. plus an eventual shootmania stream. i agree the ipl schedule is confusing 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACs_1mWHUHY here you go 




 nexus down at 13:00 min mark by EloHell. Thoroughly outplayed Armageddon. Armageddon had smiteless warwick and ashe/nunu bot lane that got destroyed. Well worth watching the VOD's

EDIT:

 Has anyone figured out a way to keep these twitch commercials from blowing up their speakers without running adblock? 




 while the zerg goes lol and fungals? 




 i find the effects of locket to be relatively useless where as randuins can straight up win a team fight. I lot of times i can Sona ult in randuins while exhausting one of the carries to create a free win. where as locket really doesnt do anything(especially late gate where 200 health is meaningless) 




 i support most games and i rarely get past 2 aura items so sounds like you are doing it right ^.^ 




 have IPL provided links to the samples for us to see/hear? 




 i assume this is sarcasm? he is participating in the OPEN BRACKET which by definition is open to anyone. 




 HD free for tonight so enjoy 









 correct. Montecristo and doa will both be casting the sc2 and LoL coverage for ogn 









 I would start out playing against bots. you learn mechanics of the game and how champions/items effect the game. buy one champion of each type using the IP you are earning or even play the free champs. 

Save most your IP. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages at level 20:

1.)AP RUNE PAGE
2.)AD RUNE PAGE
3.) TOP/SUPPORT Rune Page

then use whatever is left over to buy champions that you have tried out during their free championship week and enjoy. Make sure you buy/learn at least 1 jungler and 1 support REALLY well because thats what you will end up playing a lot as you start playing normals. :D

Itemization can be learned via reading guides/watching streams/figuring out for yourself 




 ALL OF IT. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages:

1.)AP RUNE PAGE
2.)AD RUNE PAGE
3.) TOP/SUPPORT Rune Page

then use whatever is left over to buy champions that you have tried out during their free championship week and enjoy. Make sure you buy/learn at least 1 jungler and 1 support REALLY well because thats what you will end up playing a lot. 




 for LoL I'd say Phreak and Rivington are probably your best bet. But a lot of times they will throw LoL keywords around(the same way we say baneling bust, mech comp, etc to explain complicated ideas the will say snowball the lane etc) 




 you cray cray. he said the are guest 




 please watch stephano and/or vortix vs mech and rethink your conclusion.  




 i don't even scout 4 gates any more....i just sit at my bunker and kinda laugh that he even attempted it...and then some protoss does a 3 gate blink stalker build and i bm him to the ground... i hate blink stalkers. 




 as always your source for spoiler free VOD links:

 ...and still losing. Most good zergs know that as soon as the spot mech they should go for infestors,ling , ultra and it will kill the terran and/or trade cost/efficiently 




 best joke ever. Personally i feel TCP would be the better answer 




 4.0 




 which flash app are people using? I can't get anything to show up :( 




 i do squatz then eat oatz 




 the MvP mech build linked below 




 * 1 cc's
* 2
* 3 scouting scv/drops
* 4
* 5 rax
* 6 factory
* 7 starports
* 8 upgrades/ghost academy
* 9 Army Part 2
* 0 Army Part 1 




 what are these repetition speed and repetition delay settings...cuz i don't know about them....
 




 in plat, my TvT has  been 50% win...my TvP is about 75% win, my TvZ was around 25% bc I was sticking with straight bio comps and would lose to a lot of early busts and late game became difficult to win against a good zerg. I'd said i've won all but 2 of my games against zerg since i went mech. The two i lost were based on me not protecting against counter attacks enough. 




 here are my thoughts as i watch the replay.

* no bunker at 5 minute mark...a rallied zealot and stalker could kill you straight up right now
* The protoss takes both your gas and they come late...consider throwing down a 4th rax here and then taking 3 gas puma style.
* bunker ESPECIALLY true since you are taking a fast 3rd
* scan when your second orbital finishes to make sure he has expanded...if not you need more b unkers ASAP. also good to know his tech path so you can change your comp.
* couple of supply blocks...but decent micro 46 scv's at 10 minute mark...ideal amount is 50. work on that.
* you really can't afford 3 starports
* at the 15:00 minute mark you are maxed....with 1/0 against his 1/1. and up 80 supply.
* please for the love of god at least hot key your entire army on 1 button
* the first battle happens at 18 minutes bc your opponent attacked into you with 160 supply...40 supply more than when you first maxed.
* I know artosis says when ahead get more ahead...but in the words of Day[9], "sometimes you just go f*cking kill him"
* the fight is done...you are still 30 supply up....instead of regrouping you chase him with a small section of your army...
* you still win this fight are now double his supply! woohoo!
* you do have 80 scv's....a couple too many. next time you get maxed start taking the map and choose a couple scv's and use them in your army for buffer.
* 90!!!! scvs. WAY WAY TOO MANY...a good rule of thumb is that as you take your 4th base you probably don't need to make more scv's unless a lot get killed. This might be the fact the lost you this game...over producing workers.
* 21 minutes and you are on 2/1....try to make that 3/3.
* one emp on the templar = game over.
* marauders have more sustain than marines...they can eat a couple of storms and live...need to sprinkle them into your comp late game.
 









 40 supply lead is standard in well macrod tvp...the 40 supply lead is suppose to make up for the lack of strength in out units(similar to how zerg maxes before protoss) 




 the spoiler tag is their so people can use RES to filter out spoilers. Coming to reddit and expecting not to see scores is like going to ESPN and being shocked that there are sports scores there 




 I had gone to the gym for the past week and wimped out every time. I sucked up my pride and did my 1st day

Squat:80lbs
Bench:100lbs
Deadlift:100lbs

5 11, 180lbs skinny/fat never worked out any of these movements before.

Question: I saw an excel spreadsheet the other day that mapped out warmups/progression based on first day workouts. Can some one link it here por favor? 




 this is the 2nd of the mini-30 for 30 documentaries(basically stories they think are interesting but not enough substance for the full 30 minute-90 minute ESPN treatment) that is being put out to wet appetites for the 2nd season of the full 30 for 30 




 location buttons over mains mostly and then grab scv 




 its been shown that if you take a break from school to go after a full time career that your likelihood of actually going to/graduating from college drastically reduces 




 cool sent you a pm.  




 yeah..it wasn't caught on camera but he basically amoved his army into sieged up tanks with marine support. Gretorp was showing the small side skirmishes instead.  




 cool what time? 




 what time do you go and what workout regimen you doing? 




 he got 3rd at the latest IEM only losing to MVP iirc. I believe he also beat Forgg and some other credible koreans. 




 you put the spoiler tag as well as additional automatic spoilers provided by this reddit. Use RES to filter out spoilers if you don't want to see them :) 




 It depends. My 3rd is usually up before my protoss opponent so i usually work on denying it/dropping the main. If its at the point late game where he is safely on 3 bases and taking a 4th I start to go PF, ghost, Battle Cruiser with light marine support. 




 yes...last 5 minutes of the game...probably got the same commercial 6 times in a row :( 




 controlled by govt 




 I work in the Port Industry. I've got quite a big NDA but what I can say is that I report directly to the CIO of the ports in my state. 




 my 5 year is very specific and in no way, shape, or form blocks me from getting a future job. Plus my contract came with many benefits(significantly higher pay for a entry level engineer, higher levels of access/responsibility such as my reporting directly to the CIO). In the end I read the contract, processed it against other contracts i was offered(which most had a 3 yr no compete) and determined this one to be the most beneficial to me. 




 very true...my point was just that a 10 year no compete being in a contract isn't that ridiculous of an idea..whether its legal or not is a separate matter 




 i really haven't looked into it especially since my likely next employers are not in the port industry. My point is that a 10 yr no compete clause being in a contract could very well be considered normal in the business world and isn't that outrageous. Whether its legal or not i have no clear and really dont care lol 




 all it says is that i can't work in the port industry....thats not that limiting especially as software engineering can allow you to work in multiple industries. Plus I make bank 




 I'm not allowed to compete/work with in the same domain as the company I work for. So basically, I'm not allowed to work for a company that contracts out to ports(what i do now) but I can continue to be a software engineer, just in different business sector

EDIT: So to answer your question. I'm allowed to work in separate sector of the very broad software engineering industry. I think I may even be able to work in the port industry so long as I don't work for a competitor of the company I currently work for. 




 i have a 5 year no compete clause on my contract and I'm just a software engineer. I could easily see 10 yr no compete laws at higher levels. 




 you overlooked the fact that the protoss was able to have four colossi AND templars with storm. Basically, what i'm saying is your attack came too late. Also, you successfully killed the third so at this point you are ahead. There is nothing wrong with pulling back, getting to 3/3, taking some more bases and continually denying that 3rd and bleeding him dry.  




 I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask. Especially interested if you have experiences with WestSide For Skinny Bastards and/or SS. I've got some experience with the BeachBody workouts(completed p90x, did a month of Insanity and 2 months of Body Beast) so i can do accountability on that too 




 yeah but TeamLiquid is blocked by my work while reddit isn't :-/ 




 There use to be a nicely formatted thread done every code s/code a day that would give recaps of the games and let those of us at work know how everything is going..what happened to it? All i saw today was the final results... :( 




 you do understand sarcasm? 




 I wouldn't...zerg players need to stop doing the same opening...they can't expect to beat the warhound doing their old builds from heart of the swarm...they need to experiment more.....maybe they should build more BroodLords?
 




 the first time you put real aggression on was the 20ish minute mark...you did a double drop yes but it was relatively ineffective.

 You had an early +1 but you don't use it....you can probably delay it to get faster medivacs and/or more units. Having those extra units earlier is really important imo. i would scan the natural to see his army comp and whether i can attack it while simultaneously checking the third...If the third is there i attack...if its not I pull back as he should have colossi coming VERY soon. the drop was relatively ineffective...

really imo its all about delay/punishing the third of a protoss 









 i actually really like that map too

EDIT:although i wouldn't mind forced cross spawns 




 diamond league..tired of being ranked top 8 plat
