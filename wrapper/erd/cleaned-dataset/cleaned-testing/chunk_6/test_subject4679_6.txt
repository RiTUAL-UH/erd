 Take a look at the post, and you'll see that this is exactly my point: The media take a correlation and turn it into a causal relationship without blinking. The argument is in favour of a bit of scientific literacy among science reporters. 









 Very good point! I think this is a subset or version of the hindsight bias, which is a compilation of several phenomena.  

The bit that I am focused on is the recollection of a feeling - the sense of reluctance to get on a plane, for example - and moving from that memory to a belief that "I knew it." 

In fact, it seems that we did "knew it". The distortion comes in when we forget that we "knew it" hundreds of other times as well when in fact it didn't happen. 



















 Like every field, mental health has bits of myth and meme strewn through it. One of these is that 15% of people diagnosed with major depression will eventually go on to end their lives. Perhaps you've heard this figure. Is it true?

No. Not true, never was. It's based on bad science, misunderstood statistics, and a field that wants to justify funding by making a problem look even bigger than it already is. Here's a post reviewing the problem.
