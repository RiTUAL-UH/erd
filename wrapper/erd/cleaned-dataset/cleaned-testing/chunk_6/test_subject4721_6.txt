 Some of these are the most cringe making videos I've ever seen 





























 At first I agree but seeing how Amazon has over 70 copies of this book starting at $8.50 it looks like that's how this book is going to end up also. 














 Have you tried Bien Cuit in downtown Brooklyn. http://biencuit.com/  I met the guy at an auction just before he opened and could tell he was special and I just love his bread. It's crazy good. He bakes European style with dark crusts and a great crumb. I love Sullivan Street in NYC also. I think when it comes to bread you can never have enough. 




 Thought I stole it at $2.50 but doing some basic research I found out it's not that valuable. I love Norman Rockwell and this book is full of prints and large print outs. 









 I love Norman Rockwell and I was stoked to grab this for $2.50. I thought I stole it but upon doing some basic research found out it's not that valuable but I love it anyway. It's huge (Diet Coke Can for scale), really very heavy and full of prints. The Flatbread Cookbook is really nice too. I love foccacia bread. 









 I'm not sure, I've been watching it on and off all day and some of it is interesting if you like WWII stuff. Is it strange that as I'm watching this I keep thinking how cool it would be to have a Call of Duty version of the Battle of the Bulge or be in a tank for the Battle of Kursk. 
























 Bullshit or not it was damm interesting! 

























































































 Cereal BOWL shaped bathtub. I hate that you can't edit a title and I'm to tired to delete and repost. Thanks for pointing it out. 









 I was near there that day and decided on getting Pot Stickers and Lo Mein instead. I didn't know they were destroyed in the explosion! My pics or it didn't happen http://imgur.com/a/GE4cW 














 Check this Secret Tunnel in NYC for the Presidents use http://untappedcities.com/2013/12/24/daily-what-secret-train-platform-underneath-the-waldorf-astoria-hotel-in-nyc/ 




 It looks uncomfortable as anything I have ever seen. 














 Thanks, nice pics. Are any from the Potus train Cars? If it was cheap enough I would love to find a couple of these types of Rail cars and put two together and make a home on my property in Upstate NY. 




 Nice, congrats 




 Found out all this the hard way yesterday. Live in Brooklyn and ran over some debris on the NJ Turnpike coming home from the Microsoft Store in the Paramus Mall which put a hole in the engine. Insurance junked it and now I'm taking public transport everywhere. Decided to visit my relatives in Williamsburg only to discover I have to go through Manhattan and transfer to the J or M. Great. MTA's Trip Finder is not working (first red flag) so the wife and I map it out. Decided to take the Express bus (as we had luggage) into the city and get off at Fulton to catch the J. The express bus decides to take the streets instead of the highway (red flag #2) but finally make it into the city an hour later. Walk to the new Fulton Street Subway stop and many twists and turns and a lot of fucking stairs the J station is roped off, walk back to the A going to West 4th street and transfer there. Get on A going in the wrong direction (with help from a visably frustrated MTA worker whose job it was to help people find their way with all this construction, red flag #3) and end up back in Brooklyn so get off and decide to catch the G train. After waiting 45 minutes, now with a platform full of people we all squeeze into the train as the conductor announces this is not the only G train as there will be another one coming RIGHT behind in about 25 to 30 minutes, everyone laughs and no one gets off. Finally we head out to our guessed at stop, Flushing (having never taken the G before, red flag #4) and finally have to walk along some deserted blocks to get to my father in laws apt only 4 hours after we left and we live in the same boro! It's between $25 and $30 bucks each way by cab, car service, Uber, or Lyft and in calculating it would be as much to lease a new car for a year than go through all this bullshit week in and week out.  




 No and if you look at the pics it's a really nice tram. I'd love a tram running along the east and West sides of NYC. 




 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5039838 and here you go http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-of-russias-futuristic-new-tram-2014-7? It's called the ONE. 














 I saw your post just before going to my Father in Laws Williamsburg Brooklyn apartment and remembered he had one but was surprised to see he had more than just the hamper and that everything still worked very well. Here's a few pics I took today, I didn't have a banana so I used his cane for scale http://imgur.com/a/6X4H9 




 Thanks, I thought it was a pic from The Cloisters in NYC

 Posted a picture of a really cool set of stairs to /r/pics once, was told that /r/crazystairs would like it and bam! Found another cool subreddit I didn't even know was in existence. 









 Some are my own reposts 









 A down the road neighbor had this same problem. Old man put up BLINDING lights on the side of his house that faced the neighbors bedroom at night. He kept them on 24/7 and would absolutely not turn them off for any reason. Numerous complaints to the cops came to no avail. She had her sons build a fence that in the middle by the lights is now over two stories tall. For a kicker the son put lights on the ends all pointing at every window of the old guys house and when he called the cops they used his same excuses for the lights. Never piss off a lady with sons.

 Did you know the film has spawned a controversy in the real world of baking? In the movie the baker makes Bavarian Sugar Cookies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnKQo9n7M6Q so around that time I meet a guy who wants to hire me to run his kitchen that he's planning to open in a few months and he asks me if I can make some cookies for his daughters Sweet Sixteen party and I say sure but then he hits me with a request for Bavarian Sugar Cookies from this movie he saw with his daughter the day before the party. I research it online only to find out there IS NO Bavarian Sugar Cookie, it just sounded good to the writer. They had a bakery out in California make some sugar cookies just as a prop for the movie so there was no recipe to follow. So I ended up making large sugar cookies cut like big apples flavored with sour apple schnapps with red icing and white lettering with her name and happy 16 on them. A few months later while with the wife we sat across from Maggie and her little girl (who is cute as a button) on the subway and I asked her if she knew of the "cookie controversy" her movie has created and she said yes, some friends had told her about it and she said she's been asked for the recipe instead of an autograph a couple of times. LOL

 Here you go, just make with different flavored toppings http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pretzel-bites-recipe 




 Ok, if your making boxed mac and cheese with the powder mix your going to get what's on the box, a bowl of cheese flavored orange colored soft noodles. Mac and cheese is a classic simple dish that if done well can be amazing and if not done well can still be pretty good. I have a lot of deli's in my neighborhood that have small plastic boxes of the ends of different cheeses cut into squares and the usual mix is cheddar, american, swiss, pepper jack, provolone and munster. It's usually around 4 bucks so if I'm making my mac and cheese I start with one of those.   
In a pot of salted water, cook pasta (medium shells are great as they hold the sauce very well) until just al dente, drain and stop the cooking process by rinsing with cold water until the pasta is cooled and set aside.   
Butter your baking dish, set aside. 
Start with a classic Bechamel Sauce (1 stick salted butter and 2 to 3 cups flour) while stirring cook until roux is golden brown and smells nutty   
Add 1 pint of heavy cream ( or milk) slowly while whisking until incorporated   
Add piece by piece the cubes of cheeses and whisk until melted and incorporated into the sauce and stir until all the cheeses are added to the sauce.    
Remove from heat and stir the finished sauce into the cooked pasta ( this is where you can add whatever you want to the mac and cheese such as pepperoni, chopped, cooked sausage, lobster, crab whatever you want, just fold in gently) then add to buttered baking dish.    
The mac and cheese can be served and eaten as it is now but I like the melted cheese on top and the crispy sides and corners that you can only get from finishing it off in the oven.  
Sprinkle shredded cheese, breadcrumbs ( I love sliced american cheese) on top of the mac and cheese and place into a preheated 375 degree oven until the topping is crisp or cheese starts to turn brown (15 to 20 minutes)   
Remove from oven, let sit for a couple of minutes then serve. Try it this way and let me know how it comes out.
 




 Decent reading list, congrats. Now just find a comfortable spot. 




 Just because I can't order anything doesn't mean I can't look at the menu. Besides, as a professional baker who has for years been making all kinds of breads, pastry's and assorted cookies, after you go through all the work of making 300 each almost every day for years all you want is a decent hot meal at the end of the day. 
























 Sweet! 




 Thanks, it's not my description it's theirs. I didn't want to change it if for some reason the link didn't work and somebody wanted to search for it on their own. I got the wife an ice cream maker as a bday present and I'm looking for idea's gearing up for the summer. :) 




 That's the best one yet!
