 980ti isnt going to happen. Why would Nvidia undercut their flagship gpu with the Titan X? 




 Fuck off grammar natzi.  




 Why do you post links to dead subs? you think your funny but your not.  




 was cooper dead after he ejected from his craft? and everything after that was a dream? or was he alive and did he really save mankind? my problem the cooper being dead theory is what about dr brand? shes left to die on that alien planet? or would other humans eventually find her? 




 There would be no life left on earth.  









 No one cares if you pre order or not its your money.  









 sell body parts you don't need? 














 There should be. Such a stupid move on DC/WB part. Gustin so damn good as the flash.  


































 The whole sub switch thing. so stupid.  


































 When I was in Bali I saw a dude taking a piss on the side of the street. this cant be unseen. disgusting.  









 this will be the last break this season. After this break its a straight run to the season finale.  




 Instead of Barry revealing his identity to Iris like he did in the alternate timeline in present day he revealed it to Eddy. It seems like time is finding a way to fix what Barry altered. Also in the new promo once again we see Dr wells confronting Cisco but under different circumstances. Maybe this explains why Oliver is wearing league gear because time changed so much that it caused things to change like Oliver accepting the offer to become Ra's. 









 750ti is not potato tier. An r7 250 is potato tier. thats a decent rig there.  




 ps4 or Wii U 














 When I broke my Clavicle back in high school. fuck that was pain.  









 fuckin casual. why dont you have a robot? 









 whats your budget? 









 Furious 8: The Revenge of Helen Mirren 
























 LOL kdramasters, what a joke.  




 Still not worth it. Also the only reason EA dropped the price is cause so many people refunded the game.  



















 no they just haven't updated their website.  







































 Can you change my account password again please?  
































































 I knew that crossovers were now a yearly thing but yea kinda surprising.  





























 Despite It looking a lot smaller compared to the other MCU films its got a great cast and I think its gonna have a lot of heart in it. I think the audience will really get behind Ant-Man once they see the movie. Sure it might not be a box office hit like Captain America or Iron Man but I think it will do well enough that marvel and the overall fan base wont be disappointed. I know a lot of you don't share this opinion and that's fine but I felt like Ant-Man needed some loving around here seen to many negative threads about it recently.  









 your work blocks IGN but not Reddit. Sounds like you have a great network administrator. lol 




 LOL 



















 Anyone know? buddy of mine just picked up resident evil 4/5/6 for a dollar. Could they end up charging him the full price or remove the games from his library? 




 His spidey senses were tingling.  









 really? they are already introducing inhumans and that doesnt come out till 2019. Civil War comes out next year and its too early? lol.  




 The battle between old shield and new? Iron man will side with new shield while captain america sides with Coulsons shield? 




 Before being interrupted by Caitlin I got the feeling he was going to explain everything like he did in the previous ep just under different circumstances due to the rupture of the time barrier.  




 Last I heard it booted its first commercial game ocarina of time 3D have we heard anything since? 




 Would be neat if they mentioned him being on it and teased him on AOS like the week before the show premieres on Netflix. Have coulson mention a masked vigilante going around the streets of New York saving people.  




 We continue to get ripped off and complain when we have to pay for online multiplayer and complain about how shit our fps is. we're constantly getting poorly developed games especially this gen with the ps4 and xbox one. So why do we continue to support consoles? 














 You should keep the quadro as a memento of your time together.  














 So when Joss signed his three year deal with marvel he basically became not only in charge of the avengers for that time but also became a sort of show runner for the MCU helping out other films like Thor 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy when they needed a hand and basically pointed the MCU in the right direction. However now his time is almost up and I'm wondering who will take his place? The Russo Brothers seem like the logical choice at this point but on the side they have the ghost busters to worry about and it would seem like its too much for even two people to worry about. if not the Russo brothers who would you choose to take Whedon's place? 



















 waiting for the inevitable "GTA V delayed to may 14" announcement 














 They should of kept the scene with Peters dad returning it would of wrapped up the story a bit more.  




 Le snacks 




 I get more Karma.  



















 Ikr plus I have another resit I can use if I fail anyway lol.  









 How did you know? (   )  









 Is it really that hard to get a debit card? they are so convenient how can you not have one? 



















 Tokyo 



















 "being drunk" good one :) 




 yea what the hell. Stupid move on their part.  



















  I'm finding it harder and harder to justify having a Netflix account anymore when its so much easier to just torrent stuff that doesn't expire.  




 she wasn't using it just dropped out of her pocket.  




 Yea also I heard the hobbit and the Lord of the rings will be available as well.

Maybe the New Zealand version wont be so bad after all.  




 Does she think hes too dangerous and unpredictable? If that's the reason she could just as easily put some device inside his head like a kill switch if he ever got out of control. Anyone reckon we might see Slade eventually part of the suicide squad on arrow? 














 So I've been playing basically since release and the game is great but I seem to be getting a point now where Ill start a city, get to the half way point and then just loose motivation to go any further and actually finish the city. I'm not sure why though. Anyone else feeling the same? 









 Doubt it. If hes leading a team of new avengers. Hell most likely appear at least in infinity war part 1 where may die and Bucky will take his place as Captain America.  




 Why are reports saying he wont make it out of Age of Ultron? is it just mis direction? 














 Goosebumps.  









 Allie's Bread 




 Dude I've been doing this since primary school. Vegemite and Potato chips ftw!  









 Hmm ok. well what do you think would be best? a new fan or a hotswap bay? 




 Heres a few pics of my case. The fan you see near the hard drive doesn't work anymore it hasn't been working for a while but I didn't think it was an issue until I saw my hard drive temps. I have no idea how to remove it because the way the case is designed. Hence why I just want to put a fan underneath the hard drive itself. sorry for the quality of the pics btw I used my ps vita lol. http://imgur.com/a/WaQ1m 




 So I need to put a 80mm fan underneath my hard drive. My hard drive temps arent ideal. I've seen it as high as 55c while gaming. Slight problem though. I have no where to mount it. would it be ok if I just slid it under the hard drive bay so the fan is blowing air upwards? it would not be screwed into the mother board or anything though it would be loose under the hard drive bay because I have no where to mount it.Would this be ok? 









 March is slowly coming to an end and the rumors last year indicated that Destiny would launch on PC sometime this month. Anyone heard anything? 
























 I actually laughed out loud. What is that accent? Italian? 




 because the steam machine also uses AMD. so he wanted to make it as close as possible.  




 its monthly updates once the final release is out not while its in technical preview.  




 LOL it does not have a keylogger what a load of bullshit.  





























 your joking right? 









 Bored.  




 Open Office 



















 I'm starting to think that maybe there's something to those downgrade rumors. No DX12 support are you fucking serious?  














 Wheres my KARMA Bitch! 



















 Anyone else agree? 




 who else thought the Anaglyph 3D movies were really cool back in the day? I'm talking about Spykids 3D and Sharkboy and lava girl. Call me old fashioned and this maybe the nostalgia talking but I think the Anaglyph 3D is better than the Real3D. 




 If you did not tear up while watching this then you have no soul! 




 Personally I've never been interested into the Dark/Demon Souls type games and from the trailers BloodBorne doesn't do much for me ether. So tell me why should I be excited for this game? 









 I understand the episode basically retconned itself at the end, obviously some effects of barry time traveling will play into next episiode but I'm still a bit confused on if this is a glimpse into the future or just a possible out come due to barry messing with time.  
























 So what do you guys think, should there be jedi in the game? 









 No way I'm watching them to make sure theirs no Jar Jar. If I even see a hint of Jar Jar I'm not watching.  




 They probably got the special confused with S4. S4 will film later this year once Benedict has filmed Doctor Strange which starts filming May. 




 Sherlocks probably high on drugs. Watson walks in and finds him stoned out of his mind mumbling a bunch of random words ends up telling some random story in Victorian London. Watson proably bitch slaps sherlock at the end to wake up him.  









 And even then their "bad ones" are still above average and rather enjoyable films. I.E Thor 2, First Avenger etc 




 $800 for a 680 which is now 2 generations old. It should be a lot cheaper than that.  




 As far as I know. And who says Nvidia will even release a 980ti this gen? why would they when the Titan X is their new flagship card.  




 Nice typo Mabel.
