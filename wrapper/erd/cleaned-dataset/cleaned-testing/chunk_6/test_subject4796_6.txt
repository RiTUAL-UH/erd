 Aww, thanks! 




 Thank you! 




 Damn, number 19 should be out breaking hearts, not fighting wars. 




 I appreciate your enthusiasm and support, but I think you should be careful about making broad, sweeping statements about either gender. Both genders have experienced hardship and unfairness. And while the individuals in our situations were acting rudely, they do not portray the definitive character of their gender; they were simply being jerks.
