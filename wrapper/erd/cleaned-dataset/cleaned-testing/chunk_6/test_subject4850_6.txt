 So, I started deving for DK1 using the hardware my school had one semester. When I tried to continue the project over the summer without access to the hardware, I found there was nothing like what you mentioned. If this has changed now (which it seems it has as of December 2014) then obviously that's good, but as a product that will just be starting out, it's important to do that from the beginning. 




 I am now more excited than ever to start developing games and apps on your platform. Thank you for being awesome! 




 This excites me way too much :D
If these golden tickets are true, count me in! 




 One of my biggest gripes with Oculus is the lack of an emulator for development. Is this something you guys are looking into? I really like developing for hardware like this, but sometimes the costs and limited quantities make it tough.  




 With the first iteration of whatever you guys are making at Magic Leap, how easily will developers be able to access tools to develop for it? 




 Don't forget, cocoa is also a fruit.

So you'd basically be drinking a smoothie..........
