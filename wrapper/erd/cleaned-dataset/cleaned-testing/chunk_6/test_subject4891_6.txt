 Will I be able to do waking cycles with characters? 




 So can I make boids walk in rows and formations, then interact with other boids and particles like in LotR. 




   I model in blender. Must I uv map in blender as well? Or can I uv/box map in Element 3d and then texture the model all inside AE? 




 And what sort of solution is there? 




 I'm trying to do a lotr scale battle. How do I get them to walk? Also, is there a limit to boids? I want to render several thousands battling several thousands. 









 I'm just so worried about vfx for my films. 




 Meaning it will expire? 




   Does it have all the features? I see these all the time. 









 Basically I want to do a large scale battle sequence. Maybe a few thousand agents fighting each other 




 Damn that is pricey! Maybe can I just create multiple simulations and then composite them later? 




 Massive software? I noticed you capitalized Massive so is that a crowd simulation software? 




   I'm thinking of thousands of agents. I have a powerful computer.  









 Is it possible? 









 God dammit I just want a dirt cheap/used version of autodesk maya. 




 What does that mean? 




 Original equipment manufacturer. Meaning the software comes without the fancy box. Meaning it is sold at a significantly lower price. 




 Appon.us sells OEM VERSIONS of autodesk software at low prices. I for one, think it's legit. 









 Why does it look shady? 









 Appon.us 









 Yes or no? 




   I wanna composite green screen actors into a cgi matte as well as add cgi characters. The thing is I'm new. So give me some tips and tutorials? I have element 3d, by the way, so just consider that.  




 Go easy now, I consider myself a rookie.

   Also, I read somewhere that after Armegeddon, God will purify all those in hell and take them from hell, leaving only the demons and satan? Is all this true? 




   I sculpted this head a used a uv sphere to make the back of the head. It looks great from the front considering im a first time sculpter:

But on the side there is noticeable "pinching":

   I've made a basemesh and every time I want to use it I don't want to save that as the basemesh since I want to be able to use that one basemesh for multiple characters. What could I do? 




   I already tried the whole "click on chose the best quality for videos in your youtube account settings!" Doesn't work. I have amazing Internet with multiple boosters, so it's not connection. 




  Yeah. Why do we take our children to see the latest flick? Why do teens flock to movies like Guardians of The Galaxy and 2014's TMNT? Why do we watch movies? Why do people care? The answer is the reason why we make a living out of this. So, I ask again, why do humans watch movies? 




 I have both, and am looking to create photorealistic renders, do I have enough? 









 In terms of photorealistic rendering? 









 Deus ex machina? As in the god? Can you elaborate? 




   I'm very intermediate at modeling. I'm just about a pro. I can texture and UV map like nothing. But sculpting, oh sculpting, I just can't! 
   Where are some tutorials to get me started? All i can find are tutorials introducing the tools, I want a tutorial which shows me how to sculpt something like a character. 
Please help, r/ blender? 




   I came up with a story about aliens who create the human race, but have to fight hostile aliens to do so because said hostile aliens want to prevent them from creating humans due to humans destructiveness which might lead to their downfall. 
   The thing is, this story is pretty generic. What to you scifi readers and viewers, makes a story outstanding?  














 X+y+z=15
2x-y+3z=-15
-x-y+z=-7
(Hint: solve for z and get two equations to have x and y only.)
  I don't know how to use this with subsitution. The best way would to. E to use process of elimination. 




 Thank you so MUCH
