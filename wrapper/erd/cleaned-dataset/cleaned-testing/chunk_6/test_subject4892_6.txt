 Yeah, FSU fans have experience with OK fans who are able to travel to an away game in Tallahassee; so typically the older, wealthier, and more hospitable fans.

I went to that game and every OK fan was awesome and really nice. 




 Yep, with UVA and Michigan being really close behind them. 




 Nah, it's even worse if you just started working out because you can't really push yourself *that* hard the first month. 20 pounds your first two months is straight up impossible, and he's probably greatly exaggerating. 




 I would say Rondo is, most generously, the 7th best point guard in the league.  
His TS% is awful, because he can't make free throws or shoot with any real range, and that's not only a huge liability in the late game, but it puts him altogether in the bottom quartile of all point guards in the league in scoring ability.  
His off the ball defense is not good (it's not awful, but it's not a redeeming quality for him), and he often makes plays that are more likely to get him an assist than will actually help his team.

CP3, Rose, Westbrook, Irving, Curry, and Parker are unequivocally better than he is right now. I would say he's in a tier with Jrue Holiday, Rubio, and John Wall (might not be better than him yet, but will probably be eventually); and Deron Williams and Steve Nash (might not be better than him anymore, but definitely was in recent history).

I think 8th-10th is just right for him.
 




 I upvoted you- but could you add an explanation? Opinions are always better when you have a corresponding justification. 




 Let's have a thread where people don't downvote things because they disagree with them. I want to hear people's thoughts and thought processes that seem to go against the grain of the general consensus.

 Similar to you- the reformed/arminian debate was a semi-hot topic of discussion in my ministry my sophomore year of college. I (unwittingly) led the arminian side of the debate, arguing that it was incompatible with free will.   
Someone finally asked me if I knew the scriptural inspiration for reformed theology, I admitted I didn't. They  challenged me to read "What Is Reformed Theology?" by R.C. Sproul, and so I did. I did a complete 180 over the course of the two days that I read that book; and a week later I read it a second time. Haven't looked back since.  




 Title says it all- I need a pair and I'm looking to do so on a pretty tight budget. 




 If you're on TLS- reading arrow's/scribe's guides probably have a much much much better correlation with law school success than LSAT score, haha. Either way, good luck to you.  




 The other thing I've thought about is attending a school where I am over-qualified should help with academic success. Especially with a curve. I understand a lot of it is effort and hustle, but competing against people with a 155 LSAT is way different than a 165 LSAT. Not to make the test everything, but I think its safe to say in general a higher LSAT usually means smarter. Am I wrong to think that I would have a better shot at success at the lower ranked school?  

Yes. You're completely wrong. The correlation between success in LS and LSAT score is weak enough that if you're within 5-6 points of the median then you have no real advantage the rest of the field at finishing near the top of your class.  

A good rule of thumb: don't go to a school where you're not comfortable with the idea of being median. 




 Confirmed: I am not good enough at words to write sports articles either.

 I've decided to start dedicating serious time to learning how to program with literally no background knowledge of any kind coming in save for some introductory research I've done. I'm a blank slate, and I'm especially interested in website development.

My two questions are:   
1. Starting from absolute scratch, what all do I need to learn to get to the point where I can be good enough to be comfortable designing websites for other people e.g. HTML, JavaScript? (that's not my main goal, but I think this is a good litmus test for proficiency).  
2. In what order should I be learning them? 




 Also, lol at Nowitzki and Dwight being 'might'. 




 Just out of curiosity- would you consider Yaeger a good review course?

 Not for my state, there's only a flat accounting and business credit hour requirement. I'm in law school and have taken a lot of tax classes which count for the accounting credit requirement, I have four FAR classes from undergrad, so I feel comfortable with those, but auditing slipped through the cracks. 




 I'm doing a non-traditional route to the CPA exam, being a finance major instead of accounting. I meet the education requirements to take the test, but I've never taken an auditing class before. 

Is the auditing section learnable to pass with a good review/prep materials alone? Will it be *significantly* more difficult? Would you advise any sort of supplementary material to get a more grounded education first?

Thanks for your help in advance. 




 I actually love and would buy that hoodie with the classic paintings on it. Any idea where it's sold? 




 Thing here same to say exactly the came. 




 And Rashard was great for the 07-08/08-09 season. 




 If by "liberal arts hipster" you mean "anyone who has never learned how confidence intervals in statistical hypothesis tests work," then yeah. And no, he's not right, even in a technical sense. 




 "How often?"

"Everyone" 




 As much as we need a new backcourt, I'd much rather have Noel's defense to compensate for Vuc and Nicholson who are both lacking in that area. 

I also think I'm in the minority for not loving Smart. 




 7.5pts 5.6rbs in 25mpg in February- probably on par with what the Cavs thought he could do as a rookie. I wouldn't be disappointed.  




 Yep. The most exciting thing to me is that Mo has shown that he has the athleticism and the mind to be *very* good on defense. He can eat up space like crazy and will be a menace on the perimeter in the next 2-3 years. Right now the Magic are playing terribly on defense; Nicholson is doing okay by rookie standards (still lost at times, but as he learns the game better he should get to 'respectable' territory), however Vuc is concerning - outside of his rebound-hawking abilities he's in the bottom tier of the league in defending post moves and contesting shots at the rim. But even with that in mind, both of them have shown very polished offensive games for young players, and our 3+ year future looks bright. 




 There really isn't another reasonable answer to this question. 




 I don't actually know, but if I had to guess, it'd be because if Harden won MVP it would be on land and not on water :P 




 There is no chance on God's green earth Harden wins MVP this year. 




 Lame. Do you know why? 




 Nope. Fiduciary relationships are strictly between the management and the corporation. 




 What do you think would be the best deals for the Magic? Post your hypotheticals here.

 after fiddling around for a little bit, I came up with this: 

http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b3obtzr  
And not included- Minnesota would give us their first round pick.

Minnesota isn't in a rebuilding phase- so I think they'd be okay letting go of Ridnour, now that Rubio is back and they still have Shved and JJB; and Derrick Williams who is not thriving in their system but could still develop into a pretty solid player. This would be a looking-to-next-season move for them with a healthy Love/Pek/Smith trio making a killer frontcourt for Rubio to dish to.

The Hawks are largely looking to get rid of Smith somehow. JJ fills an immediate need created by the season ending injury of Lou Williams, and they would have the ability to pick which one they wanted during the summer- either letting JJ go for the cap space they crave to sign a maxFA, or resigning him and trading away Lou; and would also get a backcourt player with a ton of upside for much cheaper, and an expiring contract in McRoberts to free up cap space.

Most importantly- for us: we would get a quality guard to make up playing time; partially over the awful Ish, and partially for the hole in our rotation JJ leaves; the rest of would be filled in by Korver who gives us the outside shooting JJ had for us. Korver and Aflallo would compliment each other well as wings, and McRoberts was in the dog house anyways so losing him is not a big deal. Our team would only be slightly worse off as a result of this trade, which is okay considering our focus is on draft position at this point anyways.  
Most attractively- we would get Minnesota's draft pick. Currently they're 8th in the lottery, which is high enough to make losing JJ really worth it. Granted, they do currently owe their 1st round draft pick to Phoenix, but it's top-13 protected, and they would have to pass where Portland is right now (3.5 games behind), so assuming we traded for the remainder of those draft rights it'd be a safe bet we get it.  
We'd have patched together a replacement lineup without JJ so as not to be *completely* awful in the backcourt; and we'd have our top-10 pick we were looking to get for him.  




 Nah, they were acting without an apparent conflict of interest; so the burden of proof to even make it past summary judgment is incredibly high. The elements are a pretty complex. See-

  his has to be fucking illegal

You'd have to know a *LOT* more of the facts than what we have - but this sounds like could possibly be a breach of fiduciary duty (duty of loyalty, duty of care, bad faith etc.); in which case the minority owners could bring a derivative suit, or the new owners could sue under a direct suit.

/lawschool 




 What's hilarious how ridiculously everyone is over-reacting too. Is he a mentally weak partial-headcase who whines and needs a confident coach to keep in check? Sure.  
Will he, if he has a good year next year by his standards, be one of the three-to-five most valuable players in league, and capable of being the 2nd best or co-best player on a championship team? Absolutely.  
People seem to remember recently how much of a pain he's been on the Lakers, but forget that he was an MVP runner up two years ago with a serious argument to win it; or how he led a team to the finals over the 66 win Cavs with Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis as options 2a and 2b, and Rafer Alston running the offense. Fans who say they're honestly not interested in signing him are downright crazy. 




 Fab Melo will be the steal of the draft  
Whoever drafts MKG will make the playoffs in the 2012-2013 season  
Austin Rivers will make 6th man of the year at least once in his career  
Jared Sullinger will fail as a pro  
Jeremy Lamb will have the best NBA career  
Charlotte will draft Andre Drummond  
Barnes will win ROY  
Anthony Davis will need time to develop

Those were some of the most shockingly bad predictions I've ever seen. 




 Let's go improving our lottery odds!! 




 Yeah! 




 Yep; looking at their professional careers (i.e. not Maravich's college stats) Wade has already had both a longer career (in terms of total number of games), a higher peak (2006 finals; 2009 in general), and overall statistical superiority in a time where stats aren't nearly as easy to come by (Maravich played half his career pre-merger, and in an era where you were getting an extra 15-20 plays a game).

It's no contest IMO. 




 Eh, I like the spirit of the idea, but I think a Volcker Rule with more teeth and fewer exceptions would be more on point to begin with the modern banking market; considering Glass-Steagall, even when it wasn't repealed, was being whittled down to a formality by complex bank structures up into the 90's.  




 I like the way you think. 




 Damn. Good point. Then replace Georgia with "some other SEC team". 




 Jameis Winston, our stud rookie QB in the wings, throws up RGIII type numbers. We return just about our entire WR, and OL, and 2/3rds of our rock-solid running game. Losing James Coley at OC wasn't a big deal because Jimbo ran the offense anyways. Collectively we break the offensive records we were setting last year, and have one of the best offenses the nation.

Defensively: despite losing three DE's and a CB who will go in the first 2 rounds of the draft, our crazy depth shines. Young guns Mario Edwards, Goldman, Jernigan, and Newberry rise up- we maintain one of the best defensive lines in the nation; and we already return all of our elite-level secondary from last year except Xavier Rhodes- whose spot sensational freshman Ronald Darby fills seamlessly. Despite losing our defensive coordinator and all-around mastermind Mark Stoops to Kentucky, Jeremy Pruitt brings the Alabama grit with him and our defense remains one of the best in the nation.

With one of the three or four best defenses in the nation, and one of the top offenses in the nation we have the talent to contend for a national title - and our coach Jimbo overcomes the coaching hump he hasn't been able to get over before - where we actually win all the games we're supposed to win. 

After an 8-0 start capped off by a road win at Clemson, who was at that point undefeated and ranked 6th, we are vaulted to top-3 in the rankings. Heading into the final game of the season an undefeated FSU embarrasses #2 ranked (and undefeated) Florida to make the perfect regular season. Then it's just a matter of crushing a respectable 9-3 VT team in the ACC championship and we're off to the national championship.

In the NC game, we upset #1 ranked Georgia and get our ultimate revenge on Mark Richt for screwing us in the 2000 NCG and claim our re-emergent ascendancy to being one of the elite programs in college football for years to come. 




 What emulator do you have for a PS2? I've looked and haven't found any good ones. 




 Also, Lillard is currently one of the worst defensive players in the league, and Billups in his prime was one of the best perimeter defenders at PG in the league. That's something you really can't ignore when comparing the two.  




 Orlando Magic in 2008 = no one ever? 




 Let's not forget what league we're talking about. 




 Fuck the Bobcats!


*the rivalry lives on* 




 Well we'd have to trade him this year because he's going to be a FA when the season ends and he simply signs with another team. If you meant trade him this year for a lottery pick next year... IIRC there are rules against trading unprotected first rounders for future years, but I could be wrong about that. 




 They're public, but I've never considered them a 'state university'.  




 Yep; I'm 6'2 150. I'm also a distance runner, so it's unlikely to change, no matter how much I eat (and I do eat- a LOT). 




 Yep.

Based on what Nicholson has done as a rookie, and what Vuc is doing now as a sophomore, I'm quite happy with them being the frontcourt of our future provided they both get better defensively. Vuc needs to get smarter about where to be to clog the paint, put on some more weight so he can bang better down low, and get better at defending against bigs in the post; Nicholson just makes a ton of rookie mistakes- which makes sense because he's a rookie).   
They're both playing well beyond their age offensively, and they could very well be 3 years away from being the best defensive rebound hawking duo in the league.

Mo Harkless is scared out of his mind to shoot, and is bad about deferring to other players. The bright side is that he's showing some very solid flashes of defensive prowess, he can straight up cover space and make things difficult on the perimeter. Best case scenario I could see him have Iguodala-level defense as a SF. He's also the fourth youngest player in the NBA, and he missed all of summer league and the preseason injured, so he might be the least-experienced player in the NBA right now. I don't know if he'll develop into a long-term starter, but I'd like to see him get a year or two before we make a decision. Adding to that- I really don't see Shabazz being worth a top-3 pick. Maybe if Turk was still our starting SF it would be worth the risk- but I'd rather not use the pick here with Mo's potential already waiting on the depth chart.

For those reasons, I think our biggest need is going to be a guard. I don't think there's a point guard worth drafting with our pick, which is likely to be top-3. I'm really low on Smart, he has a lot of intangibles that people love, but shoot-first point guards who can't shoot very well scare me. Too much bust potential there.

We *could* go for another big, and try and develop a killer rotation. Noel would bring some great (much needed) defense in the paint, but unless we luck into the top pick (or possibly the second) we probably won't have a chance to get him. Anthony Bennett could be great- but the fact that he's even smaller than Nicholson scares me, and their skillset seems superfluous.

McLemore is not only the best choice here by deduction of what we need the most, but he's probably right with (or slightly above) Noel for 'most star potential' of any player this draft. And what we really need from this draft is a star. I think we're going to trade JJ before the deadline, and DeQuan Jones is *not* a long term solution at SG. 

My pie-in-the-sky dream scenario looks something like this: we trade JJ and somehow get a top-10 pick out of it. We then draft McLemore and Michael Carter-Williams... Fast forward four years... Vuc, who is already one of the best rebounders in the league, gets his defensive act together, and comes close to replacing the Dwight-shaped-hole in our team. Nicholson has the skillset to be a middle-class man's Lamarcus Aldridge, or heck, he might just be the next Lamarcus Aldridge. Mo *could* become a better-rebounding-worse-passing Iguodala, though right now this is the biggest leap of player development faith I'm making. McLemore could seriously be the next Ray Allen; and becomes our de facto high-end-elite-team-leader that you need to win a championship. Michael Carter-Williams is a true pass-first point guard (which is great because he'll be playing with 3.5 very offensively talented other starters as previously mentioned), and has the size and athleticism to be a menace on both ends of the floor; think Jose Calderon meets Rajon Rondo.

If our five starters are elite - elite - very good - very good - pretty good; then we have a team with a bona fide shot at a championship again. Remember, we made the finals against a 66 win Lebron team with Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Courtney Lee, and Rafer Alston as 4/5's of our starting lineup.

Odds of this happening? Astronomically small. But a fan can dream. 




 You must have missed the "/skip" at the end of my post. 




 Lebron James:  
1. Isn't in the top-3 in the NBA in any major statistical category  
2. Is averaging his 2nd lowest FTA season of his career, and second lowest FT% of his career  
3. 2nd lowest apg since 2007  
4. Only .3 more than his lowest ppg since his rookie season  
5. Shooting a measly 42.1%*  
6. career low FGA

Clearly the dude is falling off the bandwagon. /skip

 Ha, I was also an FSU grad, so I try to remember the worst in Gators. 

Also- depending on how we define the south- UVA, and UNC are all much better state schools. 




 Vandy or Duke I'm guessing... although I've met UF grads who like to refer to themselves that way. Don't ask me why. 




 2018, I can feel it coming. 




 Number of players to average 20ppg for a season:  
00-01: 27  
01-02: 26  
03-04: 22  
04-05: 26  
05-06: 28  
06-07: 26  
07-08: 31  
08-09: 27  
09-10: 19  
10-11: 21  
11-12: 15  
12-13: 11 at this point in the season, and that number *could* be below 10 before the season ends. 

Do you think this is just a statistical anomaly?  




 On the flipside though- we overpaid Rashard by having Otis Smith (being the GM he was) bid against himself, and he was averaging 22.4/6.6 when we signed him. VC was averaging 20/5/5 when we signed him. The fact that both those guys regressed terribly while on our team is more a reflection of bad luck than it is our inability to grab tier-1 FA's. 

I think you're underestimating our ability to sign non-mvp-contending all-star FA's and here's why: good players will gravitate towards winning championships more than anything else. e.g. Brooklyn may be more tantalizing than Orlando to D-Will, no question, but it's not nearly as tantalizing as the opportunity to be the floor general for a championship team.  




 We're definitely not going to lure Kevin Durant anytime soon- but remember, in the last couple of years we've managed to grab Rashard Lewis, Vince Carter, and even before that Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill. Those were all big names coming to Orlando. I think if we can get to a 50-52 win season with a group of young guys, we could lure someone in the caliber of Deron Williams i.e. someone good enough to be 2nd fiddle on a championship team. 




 I agree that patience is definitely a virtue now, which is why I don't think we should be signing anyone to a max contract until 2016. Just like in 2004-2006 we drafted Dwight, Jameer, JJ, and Fran (lol) first, and let them develop before we went for Turk and Lewis. I think that cycle of drafting good talent, letting them develop, and then once they're good enough that we're not going to be seriously building from the draft anymore- start signing the rest of the pieces we need through FA to get us up into championship territory. 

I honestly don't love afflalo, and I'd be okay if we traded him at some point. I think between the three guys I mentioned above can be 3 pieces of a championship team. If we can draft three more in the next two years (here's hoping to get a good draft pick for JJ), and then sign two more down the road (an x-factor to get us into contender territory, like Rashard was) then we can have everything in place for a championship window 2018-2020. 




 Excluding the first episode. What episode do you think is at its wittiest, delivering the impeccable and hilarious humor that makes the show so great? 




 Like any other team, the Magic have one goal right now- to build a championship team. I can see us being able to attract a high-end player through FA, but despite the Devose ownership groups deep pockets were never going to be the Lakers; and like most teams were going to need to have a best-case-scenario play out i.e. nailing our next two drafts and having the guys on our team really develop well. But first, an inventory: we thought we were going to be barren this year, and while are pretty bad, we have a lot more hope than I think anyone thought going into this season. I have barely seen Kyle OQuinn play, and I dont think Etwaun Moore is going to become anything special, so Ill focus on the three players I think we can best build around.

Vucevic has been a revelation, since January when he started getting used to his minutes and role with the team- hes averaged 14.4 points, 13 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks in 33mpg and 52.4%fg. All this, and hes only 22 and a sophomore in the league. Right now hes a little light, and plays like it on defense  he doesnt have the spatial awareness or lateral speed yet to be a real paint clogger like Marc Gasol or Dwight, and hes not spectacular at defending post-up bigs yet. But hes got plenty of time to learn and get more comfortable with Vaughns defensive schemes. 

Then we have Andrew Nicholson. His minutes have been frustratingly prohibited so far this year- but in what time hes had he has been phenomenal. He has a very mature finish around the rim, and doesnt look nearly as lost as most rookies on defense. Hes 23 already- but in the next couple of years I see him becoming a Lamarcus Aldridge light. 

The player we know the least about of these three is Moe Harkless. Unlike Vuc and Nicholson, hes already shown some great flashes of being a great defender. Hes only a rookie, but he has a lot of intelligence about help defense; and I think as he gets older (hes only 19) he can become a lock-down perimeter defender and a great rebounder. On the other hand- his jumpshot is pretty bad (and his TS% of .500 is showing it). He looks like he can become Andre Iguodala but with worse passing and better rebounding. 

The takeaway? I think these three guys can be the 3rd, 4th, and 5th best players on a championship team in 4 to 5 years when they start hitting their prime. But we still need a high end elite player who can be one of the 10 best players in the league, and someone who can lead us to a championship. We also probably need one more elite player and two more good role-players to come off the bench and give us depth. The roleplayers Im not worried about- we can sign them, or hopefully use our 2014-and-beyond draft picks to develop them (especially 2014, when I think well have a pick in the 10-13 range). 

Getting those two pieces is, obviously, going to be the hardest part of putting a 2017/2018 championship team together. Jameer is great, I love him, but hes going to be 35 by then. JJ I dont expect to survive this season with the Magic. So with our likely top-3 pick in this years draft were going to want to get a backcourt player, and were going to need that player to become elite. I think the person should be McLemore. I dont see Muhammad becoming more than just a good scorer. I f we happen to land the #1 overall- I *could* see us going after Noel and having a killer frontcourt rotation with Nicholson coming off the bench. But I think McLemore has the potential to be Ray Allen, or possibly better. Then its just a matter of luring in one great free agent (Rondo 2016?) Getting our team to fit together, and letting them develop until theyre ready to make a run at the championship.
This is probably all oversimplified, and just one possible route that could happen. What do you guys think, generally, about where this team can go from here? What do you think our ideal future should look like?

 And it wasn't really a great one either. Kindof a fluff piece.  




 [Gunoud's Ave Maria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y-oY74S2FE) 




 I'm *kinda* happy about this. It's always a shame to see a player go down, and I didn't dislike Davis at all despite his poor shot selection and undewhelming defense - but It's been infuriating seeing Nicholson get so little playing time, and I'm really hoping this forces Vaughn to integrate him  more. I also would really like to see us get into the top-3 in the draft for one of McLemore or Muhammed, so the tanking aspect of this injury could be nice.
