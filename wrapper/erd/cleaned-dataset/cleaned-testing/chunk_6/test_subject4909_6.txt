 There is a problem with the editing of this report. Gamma rays, of course, don't move "close to" the speed of light. The authors know this, and I assume it is merely an error in copy editing. 














 If you like have a look at the references I have just provided in a separate comment here. 









 The clinical literature on nutrition in general and meat consumption in particular is indeed complex. One of the greatest problems is finding a proper group to study ie a group that has eaten vegetarian for a long enough time so that one can assume that the dietary practices aren't detrimental in other ways. People from South Asia would be an attractive choice, but dietary factors are heavily influenced by caste and class in their case. A lot of the reputable literature focuses on Seventh Day Adventists where a non-meat diet has been a requirement for over 150 years. That is sufficient time to justify the assumption that "they know what they are doing".

A lot of the literature focuses on specific pathologies (colorectal, gastric, breast, esophageal, etc. cancers, heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure, stroke, etc.) and doesn't really give a good overview. Here are a couple of review articles that can give a good picture of the larger picture and contain a fair amount of credible references. Also they are online and not behind a paywall.

1)[Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long) A meta analysis from 'The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'.

2)[Red Meat and Cancer: The Biological Evidence](http://blogs.plos.org/publichealth/2014/11/17/red-meat-biological-evidence) From the 'Public Health Perspectives' blog connected to the PLOS. despite the title this article points towards references outside of oncology. 

The grand consensus, if there is one, of the properly researched evidence is that there is a correlation between high consumption of red meat and incidence of various diseases. The picture is complicated as there is controversy over particular diseases. There is also a small extension of lifespan associated with a vegetarian diet when looking at groups where practice or knowledge gives a proper guide to meal balance. This is less certain than the connections to specific diseases. Put it as probable rather than certain. There is **no** reputable evidence saying that a totally vegetarian diet has any advantages over a 'restricted meat' (more than a week between servings of meat) diet. 

That's where it stands. 



















 The internet .... a devious marketing device funded by manufacturers of antihypertensive medications. 




 I see what you mean. My mind was fixated on food crops. 
























 Yes that's true in a lot of cases. It is, however, possible to make the case and have an intelligent conversation if you approach the matter in a non-ideological, non-judgemental manner. 




 It's really a matter of balance. I note that the title of the article says "less" not "none". 









 The speaker who survived the attack during which her husband was murdered is only one of the victims of what has been a series of attacks on atheists in Bangladesh. There are others. 














 The metaphor that came to my mind was more "cosmic taffee" and the end would be the great "taffee pull". 









 I hope you find it useful. 









 It took a bit of work, but I found it. Phuket is actually Phuket Island, a big Thai resort (there are a lot of them) in the Andaman Sea. The photo is on a gallery of photos at the resort's [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/phuket101/photoes_stream). I have to admit that I was sceptical for awhile. The photo hardly seems to bear much resemblance to Thai architecture. The resort, however, seems to have a large number of non-traditional buildings - some quite 'strange' actually. At the end of the day it is still a very attractive photo. 









 Another day, another episode of Looney Tunes. I'm guessing you are Daffy Duck. I'm also guessing that the only time piece you trust is a cuckoo clock. Take up a hobby that improves you if you are bothered by your inferiority.   














 Stay tuned to NASA. 




 I don't know about the ins and outs of each situation, and I`d imagine that economicsaccounting should come into each decision. I can, however, say that there are other factors, insulation costs for instance, that should be factored in and often are. Then there are more `remote` factors that involve a larger look at the economy beyond the simple accounting of any given project. Lower costs for imported produce, for instance, are connected with fossil fuel subsidies, a big issue nowadays. It`s complicated, and beyond the scope of a simple news story. 




 Now **that** is an impressive picture. Where does it come from ?

 The [Anti-Authoritarian Movement](http://ak2003.gr) is the largest and most popular anarchist grouping/network in Greece. It was formed in 2002 to oppose the 2003 Summit of the European Union in Thessalonika. The idea spread throughout the country and groups using the name played a prominent part in the opposition to the Athens Olympics in 2004 and in many subsequent events.

The AAM is not really an organization with a stated program, stable membership and clear lines of communication. It is rather a network of autonomous groups and individuals with full local autonomy. There are, of course, anarchosyndicalist groupings in Greece {[Rocinante](http://rocinante.gr), [ESE](http://ese.espiv.net), [IWW - Greece](https://www.facebook.com/IWWGreece)} and the recent beginning of an anarchocommunist grouping.

**Referendum on a outdated question but in front of a clear responsibility**

Our society is called today to handle an exceptionally critical situation. Governing institutions can no longer present solutions to a crisis that like a cancer is destroying the social net, while it is becoming clear that the survival of the system can be achieved only through sacrificing society itself. The situation created by the international financial capital and the state institutions that reinforce it is leading us with accelerated rhythm to the imposition of a continuous totalitarianism while the state of exception has now become the normal state of the new governance.

Greece is, of course, included in this experiment. Following the contemptuous offer of the institutions, the government of Syriza decided to conduct a referendum as a way to continuing the negotiation through different means. This proves of course without any doubt the failure of reaching an honorable compromise which was noisily touted as the best solution until recently. Following into the steps of the Thatcherian dogma there is no alternative, this imposition of the terms of realism leads to social passivity and an attempt to enslave life itself. This realism of continuous impoverishment, of unemployment, of no hope, of the definite abandonment of any possibility to achieve happiness, of war and of repression is very far from our own sense of logic. Society needs not only to see what is behind the closed doors of the decision-making chamber but also to move to break them.

The dissolution of capitalist promises, the inability to create a narrative that gives some prospects to the system, the civil wars that start with amazing ease and redraw borders and the agreements built on international conventions after the war lead to the same conclusion: the state can no longer determine the rules governing our lives. It is this state that Syriza wants to manage today. Syriza, however, wants to do this using all those ideas dominating until recently which led to the collapse of the system that nurtured them. Syriza has not attempted to destroy the ideology of progress, it preserved entirely the idea of growth, it continues to talk about the productive reconstruction of the country, leading to a situation that can have very doubtful results.

The referendum proposed by Syriza has no relation to the principles of direct democracy because they intend to use it as an instrument of applying pressure on the European directorate. The proposed referendum does not foresee opinion exchange, discussion and argumentation with the participation of society; instead, as it is promulgated by the governing power, it sets the question according to its own ideas seeking in the end a new agreement for the content of which society plays no role.

We need today a renewal of our devotion to the values of a different policy for social construction using direct democracy, self organization and continuous own institution building that will destroy the concept there is no alternative and obeying blindly to an endless and mindless idea of economy. New productive reconstruction can not be based on the idea of growth but on the full and absolute negation of the model of capitalist reconstruction and be based on self management, cooperative structures and the possibility for people to determine their own lives. We do not care about the currency that will be part of a national reawakening and we can not support of course a currency that is part of the financial intrusion into every aspect of our lives. We prefer to think of the currency in its normal dimension as an instrument for exchange with its main function being social needs and facilities.

Since we are part of the movement for a real social break with the internationalized financial dictatorship (which negates any idea of politics in order to put in its place the management of monetary quantities as the main social relationship), we owe it to ourselves to participate in the search for ways that lead to such a break.

Today, under current conditions and in real time, we can not remain indifferent in front of the polarization that is taking place in view of the referendum.

On the one side the YES vote is the definite entrapment to the rules and regulations of the directorate fixing a long term enslavement to a scared and defeated society, which will be soon asked to carry the weight of its own humiliation setting it as a a new regularity. On the other hand, the NO vote is limited in every possible way by the government to the terms of a new agreement, examples of which are included already in the 47 pages document, while referring at the same time to the easily digested and used in every occasion sense of patriotic duty.

Such a polarization, however, has already surpassed the calculations and the intentions of the government, and consequently the question itself of the referendum. This total attack coming from the directorate abroad and also from the system of the willing using the media as a battering ram, changed the terms of the question to the more radical YES or NO to the EU and the Euro. All actions leading to economic asphyxiation were taken using threats and ultimatums of public economic adjustment.

The effort by the SYRIZA government to combine social needs with the strong forces of money has now reached its limits, showing clearly that two watermelons can not fit under the same armpit as we say in Greek. One can not step on two different boats, as SYRIZA used to do all those years when it was in the opposition.

On Sunday, no matter what the result will be and assuming they will stay with the question, the vote of NO is not easily managed by those who undertook to support it and it may easily overcome the calculations and the intentions of the government. The fact that it uses the NO vote and includes it in the terms of its negotiation with the directorate shows the great difficulty of managing the NO vote.

The ensuing polarization opens roads of liberation and establishment of a social dynamic which has not been foreseen but which can bring forward in multiple ways the possibilities afforded by the social movements of recent years. These movements were suffocating until now or were taking a back step in front of the dynamic of representation, of assignment and of hope. This is the opportunity that is now presented to movements to take part in the battle not only symbolically but also substantially, carrying autonomously and without bosses the weight and the responsibility of the war against the totalitarianism of money, which for bosses does not just represent commercial value, but is considered the equivalent to human relations and to life itself.

We can not remain aloof or be neutral in front of this possibility afforded to movements which comes from polarization since we have been, we are and will be in real time there where what is free, public and social goes against the market and the state.

**Referendum on a outdated question but in front of a clear responsibility**

Our society is called today to handle an exceptionally critical situation. Governing institutions can no longer present solutions to a crisis that like a cancer is destroying the social net, while it is becoming clear that the survival of the system can be achieved only through sacrificing society itself. The situation created by the international financial capital and the state institutions that reinforce it is leading us with accelerated rhythm to the imposition of a continuous totalitarianism while the state of exception has now become the normal state of the new governance.

Greece is, of course, included in this experiment. Following the contemptuous offer of the institutions, the government of Syriza decided to conduct a referendum as a way to continuing the negotiation through different means. This proves of course without any doubt the failure of reaching an honorable compromise which was noisily touted as the best solution until recently. Following into the steps of the Thatcherian dogma there is no alternative, this imposition of the terms of realism leads to social passivity and an attempt to enslave life itself. This realism of continuous impoverishment, of unemployment, of no hope, of the definite abandonment of any possibility to achieve happiness, of war and of repression is very far from our own sense of logic. Society needs not only to see what is behind the closed doors of the decision-making chamber but also to move to break them.

The dissolution of capitalist promises, the inability to create a narrative that gives some prospects to the system, the civil wars that start with amazing ease and redraw borders and the agreements built on international conventions after the war lead to the same conclusion: the state can no longer determine the rules governing our lives. It is this state that Syriza wants to manage today. Syriza, however, wants to do this using all those ideas dominating until recently which led to the collapse of the system that nurtured them. Syriza has not attempted to destroy the ideology of progress, it preserved entirely the idea of growth, it continues to talk about the productive reconstruction of the country, leading to a situation that can have very doubtful results.

The referendum proposed by Syriza has no relation to the principles of direct democracy because they intend to use it as an instrument of applying pressure on the European directorate. The proposed referendum does not foresee opinion exchange, discussion and argumentation with the participation of society; instead, as it is promulgated by the governing power, it sets the question according to its own ideas seeking in the end a new agreement for the content of which society plays no role.

We need today a renewal of our devotion to the values of a different policy for social construction using direct democracy, self organization and continuous own institution building that will destroy the concept there is no alternative and obeying blindly to an endless and mindless idea of economy. New productive reconstruction can not be based on the idea of growth but on the full and absolute negation of the model of capitalist reconstruction and be based on self management, cooperative structures and the possibility for people to determine their own lives. We do not care about the currency that will be part of a national reawakening and we can not support of course a currency that is part of the financial intrusion into every aspect of our lives. We prefer to think of the currency in its normal dimension as an instrument for exchange with its main function being social needs and facilities.

Since we are part of the movement for a real social break with the internationalized financial dictatorship (which negates any idea of politics in order to put in its place the management of monetary quantities as the main social relationship), we owe it to ourselves to participate in the search for ways that lead to such a break.

Today, under current conditions and in real time, we can not remain indifferent in front of the polarization that is taking place in view of the referendum.

On the one side the YES vote is the definite entrapment to the rules and regulations of the directorate fixing a long term enslavement to a scared and defeated society, which will be soon asked to carry the weight of its own humiliation setting it as a a new regularity. On the other hand, the NO vote is limited in every possible way by the government to the terms of a new agreement, examples of which are included already in the 47 pages document, while referring at the same time to the easily digested and used in every occasion sense of patriotic duty.

Such a polarization, however, has already surpassed the calculations and the intentions of the government, and consequently the question itself of the referendum. This total attack coming from the directorate abroad and also from the system of the willing using the media as a battering ram, changed the terms of the question to the more radical YES or NO to the EU and the Euro. All actions leading to economic asphyxiation were taken using threats and ultimatums of public economic adjustment.

The effort by the SYRIZA government to combine social needs with the strong forces of money has now reached its limits, showing clearly that two watermelons can not fit under the same armpit as we say in Greek. One can not step on two different boats, as SYRIZA used to do all those years when it was in the opposition.

On Sunday, no matter what the result will be and assuming they will stay with the question, the vote of NO is not easily managed by those who undertook to support it and it may easily overcome the calculations and the intentions of the government. The fact that it uses the NO vote and includes it in the terms of its negotiation with the directorate shows the great difficulty of managing the NO vote.

The ensuing polarization opens roads of liberation and establishment of a social dynamic which has not been foreseen but which can bring forward in multiple ways the possibilities afforded by the social movements of recent years. These movements were suffocating until now or were taking a back step in front of the dynamic of representation, of assignment and of hope. This is the opportunity that is now presented to movements to take part in the battle not only symbolically but also substantially, carrying autonomously and without bosses the weight and the responsibility of the war against the totalitarianism of money, which for bosses does not just represent commercial value, but is considered the equivalent to human relations and to life itself.

We can not remain aloof or be neutral in front of this possibility afforded to movements which comes from polarization since we have been, we are and will be in real time there where what is free, public and social goes against the market and the state.

The ensuing polarization opens roads of liberation and establishment of a social dynamic which has not been foreseen but which can bring forward in multiple ways the possibilities afforded by the social movements of recent years. These movements were suffocating until now or were taking a back step in front of the dynamic of representation, of assignment and of hope. This is the opportunity that is now presented to movements to take part in the battle not only symbolically but also substantially, carrying autonomously and without bosses the weight and the responsibility of the war against the totalitarianism of money, which for bosses does not just represent commercial value, but is considered the equivalent to human relations and to life itself.

We can not remain aloof or be neutral in front of this possibility afforded to movements which comes from polarization since we have been, we are and will be in real time there where what is free, public and social goes against the market and the state.

 Granted but...Rome wasn't built in a day, or fed either. 




 BBC: [Greek referendum: Early results show no vote ahead](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33403665#") 





























 Yes it is. Another person has commented on this elsewhere. 





























 Governments define it as such if they can't regulate and tax it. Like pretty well every country in Europe (I am uncertain about Estonia) Greece has a VAT. Never mind income tax for the venders. You don't have to be selling drugs or guns to be breaking the law from a government's point of view. I wouldn't be surprised if well over 90% of goods and services traded 'under the counter' are very much 'legal' in themselves. 





























 I think the wording contains more than a few 'dilemmas'. It's a situation where a therapeutic intervention seems to involve a high risk of a deleterious outcome unconnected to the original problem. The dilemmas involved would include:

-To do or not to do (the surgery)

-To improve or not to improve (the anaesthesia) and if improve how

-To prevent or not to prevent (the harm) and if prevent how

-To mitigate or not to mitigate (the harm) and if mitigate how

-To accept or not to accept the harm (patient/parent/physician/teacher/therapists/etc. interactions) and this is a really big 'how' 









 Bye. Travel well. 
























 There's actually an amusing story behind the Bolshevik excuse for the raid. There is disagreement about whose car was actually stolen. The Lockhart referred to in the Libcom article was the British ambassador, and some sources say it was his car. Others say it was some communist bureaucrat's. In any case they should have returned the fucking car and told the thieves to vacation in Astrakhan. It probably wouldn't have done any good. I'm sure the Bolsheviks would have found another excuse. 



















 Thanks. Valuable news. I was going to post this myself. Let's hope the development continues. 














 I know. Someone else has commented on the title elsewhere. As that commentator said, I didn't do it. It was the original title from the article.

In the years since the factory occupation in 2001 at the height of Argentina's financial crisis and the formation of the [FaSinPat](http://www.ceramicafasinpat.com) cooperative in 2005 that formalized workers' control in the enterprise the workers of ex-Zanon have become something of world celebrities. Their response to the ruling class' austerity has been documented in numerous articles, reports, books and even a documentary movie.

They have certainly blazed a trail in showing a method whereby ordinary people can fight back against the decisions of their 'betters', a modern method that gives an alternative to the political dreams, 'revolutionary' or reformist, of political parties. Every step, however, has involved struggle and hard work, intelligence and experimentation.

Once more there is another struggle. Machines depreciate. Technical advances take place. Factories have to be upgraded. Despite promises and generous grants to private industry the Argentine government has dragged its feet for two years on funds for the FaSinPat factory.

Once more the FaSinPat workers are calling on the public support that has stood against the government so many times before. Here from [Rojo y Negro](http://rojoynegro.info), the voice of the Spanish [CGT](http://www.cgt.org.es), is their press release.

@@@@@

Today workers from FASINPAT (formerly Zanon) accompanied by the ceramist union conducted a press conference at the factory. And later at 12 noon at the Hotel Bauen (Federal Capital) with the presence of Nora Cortinas, Myriam Bregman, Adolfo Perez Esquivel, union representatives of the Garrahan workers, and Bauen social, political, union, student and human rights groups. To publicly report the situation we are going through at the factory in the face of the lack of decision on the part of the National Government to grant the necessary appropriations for the technological upgrade and the government of the province of Neuqun to meet the demand for loans also serve the technological upgrade.

They have taken more than 2 years after the presentation of all the documentation required by the Ministry of the National Economy to agree to the credit of FONDEA and all the documentation for the $ 32,000,000 credit promised by the government.

The factory is threatened and our future too. The equipment has became obsolete and that complicates and makes it very difficult to produce and raise the millions for consumption of gas and electricity. Our salaries were delayed for three fortnights and it begins to generate HUNGER FOR OUR FAMILIES. As we did in 2001 we will not let the jobs or the factory be lost, and the lack of answers makes us put on sale some portions of our land.

All the ceramic technology industries were upgraded in recent years with funding from national and provincial governments. Without going out of the neighborhood Cermica Neuguen up to now Cermica Alberdi Neuquen of Salta (whose construction was financed entirely by the national state).

We presented our technological renovation project in Nacin 2013 and we entered the Bicentennial credit program. Prior to termination this program had delivered more than 11 billion pesos to 500 entrepreneurs, many of them subsidiaries of foreign monopolies like Toyota, Carraro or Metalpar.

.The Workers and workers of Zanon will not lower their arms and give up the fight for technological renewal and continuity of the factory. That is why we want to inform the community about our situation.

**Call Out**

On Tuesday, July 7th at 9am we will make an action in the Federal Capital to raise our demand, focusing on the Congress on the nation to make our claim and from there march to the Ministry of Economy of Argentina. This action will be accompanied by various sectors, human rights, political, student and various workers' delegations.

We appreciate the support of the community we have received and we know that this time they will also join us.

We appreciate your dissemination of this press release.

 Well, I don't think there is a huge surplus of goods in Bulgaria or Albania. I am uncertain about the border controls on either, but they are probably stricter in the case of the latter. As to the other two land neighbours, Macedonia and Turkey, the borders are far from 'lax'. I don't think any black market trade could make up for the loss of regular imports. 






















































 Currency controls apparently, but I wouldn't rule out deliberate withholding on the part of some transnational companies. 




 I'm sure some of the cancellations are 'crisis panic' decisions. If there is any stable situation, no matter what the stability short of a military coup, in the future then I'd expect a rebound, particularly amongst bargain hunters. 
































































 "The Lord helps those who help themselves". 






































































































































 Fairly corrupt then. I've seen quite a bit of news about anti-corruption campaigns in China. From what you are saying the government has a hopeless cause here. All they can do is bump off a few of the bigwigs (those without enough friends and too many enemies) while the rot extends all the way down to the bottom. Sounds very much like the old Soviet bloc. I guess some things don't change, or even get worse, whatever the policies of the ruling class in power. 
























 That is one of the paths to explore ie his writings during that period. It's been quite awhile since I've read Proudhon so that has to be charted out. I think, though I may be wrong, that 'The Political Capacity of the Working Classes' (1865) would be the most likely place to find his final views. It was, after all, his deathbed book. I will, of course, pay attention to what was or was not published while he was alive. In the end, however, I am less interested in what he thought and more in how his views ere seen and reflected in the wider labor movement. It's there I find things that make me call myself a 'mutualist'. Gradualism. The importance of cooperatives though I certainly don't see them replacing unionism. A toning down of the violent rhetoric that often flows through anarchist writings.

I'd have little doubt that Proudhon's views were among the many things misinterpreted by Bakunin, but I don't think Bakunin's personal views were wholly responsible for the immense stupidity of the 'Bakuninists' allying with the Marxists to fight the 'Proudhonists' at Basle. With the English trade unionists looking on in horror no doubt. Things to explore.

Proudhon is naturally difficult and easy to misinterpret. Not just because his views kept changing. My favorite story about that is his trial in Besanon over his 'Warning to Proprietors'. The jury found him not guilty because they refused to convict over writings that they couldn't understand. Few people have that on their CV.

In any case I look forward to your review in Black Flag. 














 Well, that may be so when I think about it. Perhaps infinite regress may turn out to be the only sensible answer hen all is said and done. 









 Whenever you finish 'La Fin de la premire Internationale' it would be great if you could send a review this way. It would be greatly appreciated.

In any case I'll be continuing on the path down the years from Bakunin to mid-century. The Berthier article piqued my interest as you might see from my own additions to what the Groupe Salador-Segui/Berthier had to say. 

Here's a rather crude sketch on where I am going:

1) From Proudhon to the Paris Commune. How did Proudhon's views come to be embodied in French labor ? Proudhon himself at one time was none too sympathetic to the ideas of unionism, strikes, etc.. When looking at Flora Tristan's effect on the Lyonnais workers it seemed that she was much more influential (and influenced by) with them than Proudhon ever was despite the fact he spent much more time there. Did Proudhon change his views over time ? He certainly did, but in what way.

Proudhon's views, or at least the invocation of their spirit, became the majority current in French labor. Their role in the International. The (foolish) attacks on them by the developing 'pure' anarchist movement, exemplified by the Congress of Basle where the 'Bakuninists' united with the Marxists to defeat the mutualist current. Subsequent history supports the idea that this was one of the stupidest things that has ever been done in the name of anarchism.

Following from there the influence of various strains in French labor that adopted the name of 'mutualist' and the fact that they *weren't* all the same thing. The contrast between *Tolain* (antifeminist, individualist, orthodox "Proudhonian" position against strikes and finally member of the French government that sent the troops to suppress the Commune) and *Varlin* (feminist, collectivist, syndicalist and killed during the suppression of the Commune) illustrates this diversity. It is probably reflective of contradictions within Proudhon's own opinions. That, of course, is definitely your field not mine.

2)The years of eclipse. From the Commune to anarchosyndicalism. Growth of the 'terrorist option' in this atmosphere of defeat. This terrorism is more of a progenitor of modern 'insurrectionism' than the classic 'charcoal burner' rural adventures. Lots to say here, and none of it complementary to the terrorists. 

Meanwhile the slow percolation of developing syndicalism amongst French workers which resulted in the formation of the CGT which had its own ideas, often very contradictory to those of the anarchists. I suppose I'll have to throw Pi y Margall and his quasi-Proudhonist ideas into this in talking about Spain. The slow awakening from the "sleep of fools" of the anarchists in relation to their terrorist 'comrades'. Amsterdam Congress 1907. Confrontation of the purists and the syndicalists. Neither side 100% right or wrong. Malatesta's views then and later when he also (like Bakunin) was more mature. The last major 'kick at the can' of support for terrorism amongst the majority of anarchists - Goldman's 'heavily cloaked' resolution on individual acts of rebellion.

3) Syndicalism: Growth and partial eclipse. Treading water. From the CGT to WW1 and the rise of fascism. Unfortunate consequences of the terrorist worship of violence and its influence on the rise of fascism. The disastrous myth of the Russian revolution. Partial recovery of syndicalism. Bolshevism, syndicalism, parliamentary socialism, internal labor struggles. The Spanish exception. FAI adventurism more connected with classic insurrectionism than terrorism. Opposition to the FAI and the disastrous results of their policies.

4)On the outside looking in. Anarchism after the fall of Spain. Its rebirth in the late 60s. Modern anarchism and insurrection. 'Invasion of the Mao clones'. Sources of modern 'insurrectionism'. Autonomism and other escapees from the Stalin zoo. 'Insurrectionism' today.

As you can see it's a long term project. It's not breakfast. It's a ten course meal. If you have any writings that you feel would be appropriate for anything in this long trip through history feel free to post them at r/worldanarchism.

 
































































 Yes, reality is 'D's and 'T(urtles)'
