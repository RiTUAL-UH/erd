 There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently. 
























 Yes, it's a big European event, from what I've been told. I'm only considering because I'll be at ISC the week before (and already overseas). Had planned on working in some other travel but not sure if this is going to worth the time. The technical program is quite solid--lots of involvement from CERN and research agencies there.  









 Out in Oregon where all the folks are building their massive datacenters (not supercomputers, to be fair--but just as many cores), this is becoming a huge concern. At some point, they're going to have to move to greener pastures (literally)... not sure how this issue isn't at the forefront of people's minds--don't even see anything about it in the disaster recovery space much. Yet meanwhile, look at the situation the whole West Coast was in... not to be dramatic about it, but this is a growing concern. 


































 Yeah, can't blame you there--and I think I've heard the same general statement more than once in the last couple weeks. 





























 The top one with the vertical lines is a typical horn coral--looks like you might have some crinoid bits throughout in addition to the shells. Nice finds, though. The one your brother found is pyrite--sparkly but common too. Still a nice start to a budding collection. Try to check out the area around you there in Ohio for trilobites and other semi-common fossil specimens, they're all around if you know where to look. Here are some day trip ideas http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/GeoFacts/geof17.pdf 




 *rubs hands together and cackles* -- between stacked memory and Volta, it's going to be quite a year, 2016. 

















































 Actually Jeff Squyres is their MPI guy and writes some great stuff. Not a thing to do with Cisco or pushing any agenda. Talked to him at SC in the past and he just really likes what he does, even if his company doesn't invest a lick in HPC. 














 To be fair, they did carry the other side of the debate here just a couple days before. http://www.hpcwire.com/soundbite/toward-realistic-quantum-computing-measures/  









 This is one of the best rockhounding posts I've seen in a couple of months. Beautiful, big finds. What area of CA (county) were you in? 




 I think that's his main point--he says it in the recorded part of the interview at the bottom that even with a top system, without experienced programmers who can optimize their codes, it's all useless. With GPUs, Phi, etc... at least having a familiar programming model is a benefit for users onboarding their apps quicker than with say CUDA 



















 Jade (green) and common quartz 




 Agreed, they are quite beautiful to look at but not entirely uncommon--great find, however! 









 Wonderful--I love this! What tools do you use for your carving?  









 It's only 9 a.m. but I'm already sure that's the coolest thing I'll see all day. Where is it from? 














 Possibly a pink Smartie? -- Posting photos is a must here...hard to say anything without one. 




 Agreed here. I have several similar pieces (some next to crinoids or with horn coral intermixed) from the Petoskey area of northern Michigan.
