 I just searched through it myself, after reading your comment, and now feel a bit dumb. I remember thinking my tooth-fairy remark was funny as shit at the time (I was slightly drunk). 

It prompted a discussion between me and Diane, because I hadn't grown up with the whole tooth-fairy thing, and wanted to find out if she had believed in it.  




 Thank you, I would say that sharing it with others does reduce the burden. 

I don't want to try astral projection or anything like that, because I want Diane to go on to her next life and experience all the happiness she deserves. To be honest, I pray that she doesn't even remember me. I don't want her attachment to me to hinder her journey.  




 She was decent. She enjoyed solving the tests, but to be honest I think she liked the story lines more. Sometimes she got frustrated and watch walk-throughs. She also liked to watch me play.  




 I used to. But, I know she had to leave eventually. Her attachment to me shouldn't hinder her on her journey, and I want he to know that. I know she must be someplace as beautiful, and amazing as her now.  




 It's not silly at all. Diane and I always kept a white-board on our fridge, where we'd write things we needed to do, and our shopping list. 

Some things (errands we hadn't gotten to yet, and frequently purchased groceries) would just stay on there, cluttering up the board forever. 

The other day I went through the list to erase the things that had already gotten done (mostly things pertaining to Diane's funeral services, and my recent trip to India). 

I don't drink cashew milk, but Diane kept it on the list. I started choking up right after I erased it.
