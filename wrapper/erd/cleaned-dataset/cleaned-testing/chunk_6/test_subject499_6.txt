 I like to keep busy. I'm not really doing anything with my degree, so I have to make sure I'm working towards what I really want. Writing for games, becoming a novelist. And somewhat trying to break into film (my degree) with a short film I need to start... 




 No. If it is something that can be taught I'm certainly not the person to be teaching it. 

Neil Gaiman is the best person to look to for this advice. There are plenty others, let me find the video. [This video is genius! Just watch this, it solves everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C48jAkVlI0) 




 Requiem for a Dream. That's a must.

Dallas Buyer's Club as well, though I haven't seen that myself, he was meant to be amazing.

Also, though Leto is barely in it, you haven't seen Fight Club? You need to see fight club. I don't care if I'm breaking the first two rules, see fight club. 




 Yeah The Amazing Spider Man 2 kinda bombed. But that didn't mean the setup for the Sinister Six wasn't spot on. Dehaan made a great Goblin. We could have actually got a decent Venom. And a whole host of other baddies. I'm eager to see where Marvel take it, but that won't be for another few years now. I just like to imagine what could have been done, and would have liked to have seen the universe they started up expand. 

And for *God's Sake* somebody put *Carnage* into a goddamn spider man movie! 




 Depends how well received the character is. Spotlight is absolutely on Leto. And that does give her a chance to shine. The problem with this film is that there is so much potential for it to bomb. I don't want it to, I don't expect it to. But it might. 




 This week I've been getting up early so I can really put some work into my book. Trying to pump out at least 1k words a day. Which is great because that takes me about an hour, and I can then work on either my games, or developing my screenplay :) 




 Suicide Squad...? 




 They're definitely going to do a sequel. No doubts. Just no idea when. 




 I think they said if they ever did another game it would be with a whole set of different characters. It wouldn't surprise me if they did, perhaps, return to Ellie, maybe even Joel, but I don't think they want to do that any time soon. 




 Why would a prequel make more sense? 




 Add me: MC SHIMMY 




 I understand that. I couldn't help you find a rare, old book company. There has been a lot of news recently about first-edition novels being sold at auction. If you investigate those that might lead you down the right path, perhaps.

Failing that. If you're expecting close to 1k, shelling out $120 isn't too bad when you're guaranteed a decent return. 




 Also watch the Youtube channel 'Extra Credits' if you don't already. They do videos on game design and they're incredibly useful. They do a set of videos on game narrative which you *have to watch*, but also look at the others to get a good overview of game design in general. If you can bleed good game design and game-design-understanding into your prose, all the better for you. 




 http://gamejournalismjobs.com/

This is a great site, the one I got my job from. Just don't hold out for paid work. I wrote seven articles, and got paid $.70 so...You just have to be willing to work for free.

Never heard of that Neverwinter Nights module. :)

Having a degree is certainly a boost. My degree is in film (which helps for screenplays) but not prose (which is why my novel was so important). You just have to find the right assets you possess and plug them. 

The thing about working in the industry is that it breaks into two compartments: Design, and programming. Programming is obviously...just what it says. Design covers modelling, texturing, concept art, an entire haberdashery of jobs. But nothing that commits to writing. Most studios pull writers from designers who work in another department. Like I said, not a lot of studios have dedicated writers. You could get an intership, sure. No problem. It would be mostly office work, which is something you could do. Your difficulty then comes in where to take it from the internship. You can't program, or design. If they don't need a writer, you're out of luck and stuck as an intern. 

This is why I recommend the indie route. There are a lot of indie companies out there who have formed from the previous workers of AAA studios. You probably won't start there, but you can work your way up there. It *is* a ladder. Unlike AAA gaming a lot of of indie games do put emphasis on story, and will hire a writer to allow their meagre staff to work on programming and design. That's why it's so good. If you write a game and it breaks out (mine is out in three months, here's to hoping it's successful), then you could get jobs coming to you. 

Oh, also, I've been working on this game for over a year. Coming on to two. I joined the game after they'd been working on it for nearly a year. Don't expect to have a gaming portfolio built up quickly. If you can prioritise work, and work efficiently, you can join multiple games and have a number of games released roughly the same times. Which leads me to...

Most of the jobs you join will collapse. It's the nature of the work. I've joined over 20 companies, some have just never been able to stay in contact, of their ideas are too ambitious, or the team just implodes. If you can work out quickly which teams are likely to stick at it and which aren't, you'll do yourself a big favour. Mostly the best way to check is to look for if the studio has anything previously released.

Also, look into GDD's, writing crowd-funding campaigns and other writer-y things. Again, it's all to put into the portfolio. You want to convince the team you're the best person so show them you can do more than write a story. Anything that involves words, you can cover it, you're the guy to do it. 




 Can't you go along to a second-hand book store, or equivalent and get them 'appraised', so to speak? 

If you had an idea of value, it wouldn't be difficult to sell them through Ebay or equivalent. Someone out there will know how much a book of that type and age and quality is worth. 




 YES YES YES YES!

I didn't get this until last year, which was a couple of years after it 'resurged'. Not reading this book the moment it piqued my interest was a mistake. Normally when I finish a book I mull it over and decide how much I like the final product, whether or not it approaches the level of my favourite novels. But with this I was a few pages in and I just *knew* it was amazing, that it would go on to be one of my favourites. The prose was consitently beautiful throughout, each stage of his life was heart-wrenching and human and true. I was so surprised by how amazing it was, because it was just fantastic. No one could have expected a novel to be so good. It set out to do something unique, and it really delivered! 

I would love someone to write something so in-depth about a life like that in modern times. Would be a really interesting look at our society. 




 I always give my characters two things:

Values, and

Motivations.

What does your character value? What motivates them? For characters enduring a journey, that's a large part of it done. I know that characters aren't always that simple and there are shade of grey. So introduce bi-values and bi-motivations. At the end of the day we are all just trying to keep a hold of what we value, and what we want (how motivated we are to get what we want though...)

Creates interesting arcs as, when the story develops, their values and motivations change. Or one changes but not the other.

A lot of the time these two coincide. 

 




 Understand. You won't get hired to be in the industry. You won't. Not a chance. There are a small handful of companies who hire dedicated writers, and, I'm sorry, you're not going to land a job straight away writing for Irrational Games.

Indie games though, that's the way to do it. But understand that every single writer, who doesn't know anything about *making* games and just wants to *write*, is trying to break into the indie scene in the same manner, it's super over-saturated.

Here's what I did:

write stories and write screenplays. Demonstrate you can write both prose and dialogue. If you can hand in a properly formatted screenplay (alla Celtx) all the better. I had a completed novel underneath me when I started to apply. It demonstrated I can stick to a task, and won't flake. It was also in decent condition, and I was pretty happy presenting it as the main part of my portfolio.

Get your hands on Unity or UE and learn basic game programming and modelling. Nothing heavy, just enough to understand how everything is working under the hood. Be aware what the rest of the team is doing, and, above all, understand the limitations of the medium and that *the story never, ever comes before gameplay*. If you can show that you have a basic knowledge of Java or a C language, or of art and model design, it again shows a willingness to learn and get involved. I'll tell you why this is important. I write big, I like big scenes that are incredibly cinematic, but I know they can't be made. I understand how the team are limited, by time (mostly) but also by the engine limitations and priorities; and making sure the game works comes before the story. If you are writing, and you understand that something won't work, you can save a lot of time and hassle by understanding that an idea won't work, and just hand in a more tame version.

I found work for an online gaming magazine, and wrote a few articles. Show dedication to the medium, show insight and passion. Again, a good portfolio helps for this.

Breaking in isn't easy, you really have to make yourself stand out.

I think that's everything...

  




 Would mostly look at books, and my own writing, as a way to keep me on track. Maybe mix in a few other things.

So I just wanted to ask what kind of things do you like to see on vlogs? If you watch booktube vlogs, what do you like about them, or dislike?

If you are a booktuber, any advice for a newbie?

Just looking for general advice and ideas from the community about what kind of things to include or exclude.

Thanks :) 




 Yeah, Antichrist is a different kettle of fish. It's something else entirely. But totally worth the watch. If you've seen his other films then you'll be ready for the blows that come, so it won't be too bad. It is though a really good film, and it's held together really well. 




 Lars Von Trier. 




 The dinosaurs aren't dead! They're on Atlantis!

Screw No Man's Sky and Ark. We need a supernatural, pirate, Dinosaur game. 




 Eh, get it in store. Try order from Tesco, etc? 




 It never struck be as being anti-religious for the sake of being anti-religious. I actually don't think it's a reflection on Christianity because Christianity didn't exist. It's an interesting idea about how the religion could have formed, and the new testament. Without it ever really being a bash at religion. It just removes the miracles and makes Jesus a normal man. Which I think is ok. 




 Neil Gaiman. Read his kid stuff, read his adult stuff, will read his comics when I can afford the entire set.

Also Philip Pullman. Love HDM. And I quite enjoyed 'The Good Man Jesus'. 




 Nymphomaniac. 




 Whenever I preorder from Game I put down a fiver, and then pay for the rest when I pick up the game...

Are you talking about online? 




 Ah, of course, so obvious. 




 Gotta ask why does it matter? 




 Atlantica. 




 *Pirate Asassin!*

What's more kickass than a *pirate assassin?!*

I swear to God if there were dinosaurs my tiny mind would have exploded. 




 You're asking for historical accuracy from a video game? 




 It was always there to help, in the bottom corner :) 




 "Hairy *baby*...hairy babeee*" 




 Sure. Look at the 'formatting help' at the bottom of the typy-window.

An asterisk on each side is *italics*. Two asterisks on each side is **bold** 




 Thanks for sharing those. They were great. 




 I would be quite interested in this. Had a look on the website you do film reviews too? Looking strictly for someone to do games because I would enjoy doing games and film. I've written game articles before, but not film. 




 I do my best to help =] 




 I have been known to do that myself. Waiting for something interesting to pop up I can put a comment on :) 




 Good luck. If you want to I'll read over what you've written (when you've written it.) 




 Sure. Just appreciate the ramifications of your protagonist expecting his younger sister to enjoy being raped. Sure, he doesn't understand, and the audience will get that. But you've still got to write it. As long as you don't dwell too heavily on it. Perhaps her screaming is him first realising something isn't right, it's not the same as all the other times. The catalyst for him to start panicking and *really* worrying about his sister. 

So phrase it as "something was wrong, this wasn't like the others times."

Than; "The others had liked, why didn't my sister, I thought she would like it."

Everything will be ok. 




 Writing my story, need to use italics, which is a simple ctrl + i away. But no, my stupid fingers put in an asterisk. Bad stupid fingers. 

Do we all spend too much time on Reddit?

Edit: Sorry I mussed up the heading. Missed out the 'you' dang it! 




 Then you lose his innocence. You can take it multiple ways. It's possible he's familiar with sex, but being familiar with the concept of rape could be a bit much.

I think that even if he understands what is happening it hinges on him not quite grasping why it's such a wrong with to do? Am I right? If he's just upset because his sister is crying, and in pain - that'll do. He doesn't quite understand *what* it is exactly that's causing that. He just understands its something bad. 

Maybe he does understand. But just think about what kind of an edge you want the scene to have. You can make it excruciatingly sharp if he's very innocent and doesn't understand. 




 Couldn't just do a repeat of a guy being eaten off the toilet... 




 Probably wouldn't understand rape. Just have to say he tied her up, she cried a lot, and he moved on top of her. The boy wouldn't know or understand any of the finer details. You would just have to be sort of vague, but in a sense that everything that was happening would make sense to the reader. It would just have to be all action. A very literal telling of what was occurring. 




 **The Golem's Eye, by Jonathan Stroud** 




 I wanna play... 




 Evolution? 




 It doesn't hurt. Really doesn't. Forearm might get a bit sensitive, especially after a while - and that'll make it sore. That's the worst of it.

As for tipping. I live in England, and we don't tip here. I wanted to once. But I'd been lying down for two hours, and shivering from the cold and having my ribs tattooed for two hours. I got up and I was woozy as anything. Forgot to give him more than he asked, because he did a fantastic job. 




 If you really want to throw everything and anything that matters to you out the window, sure. 

Social life. Friends. Family. Hobbies. No time for films. Or games. Or pets. Or relationships. Or reading. No job. No money. 

If you wanna live like Asimov and forsake the internet (and do all your research from thick encyclopedic tomes), that's fine. 

Today's world is ridiculously different from Asimov's. Difficult to compare. 




 To the contrary, holding down a blog would likely significantly boost your productivity towards a story.

Let's face it, you can't spend an entire day writing a story. You'll burn out, or get bored, inevitably procrastinate. But, rather than not be writing, you could be writing a blog post. This will break up your writing, going from story to blog and back. It'll keep you in the right frame of mind. As mentioned, if you work in tidbits about your novel (even just progress, anything you're struggling with) it'll keep you motivated and on point. You won't be working on the novel, but you'll be thinking about it. Kinda passively working on it - in a way. Having an audience might be significant boost to your writing as well. Keeping a blog is fun and an audience gives it a point to exist: if you're writing about your novel, that point to exist comes over to your novel. You're more motivated to work on it.

I hope that made sense. I'm sorry if it's all gibberish.

To summarise: keep blog, it will help. Focus less on it. 

Maybe update once a week. Don't write too much. You have to give yourself a break from your novel, nothing wrong with that. So put that break into a blog. Stull being productive. 




 I want you to know that I hate you.

(Read: I wish I was that talented) 




 No.

The original is perfect.

You're treading on hallowed ground... 




 Ooh me me me =]

Please give me an interesting/easy one :)

 Should be able to automatically insert it across the whole document. Rather than type it.

But I'm not sure how to do it on MS.

Click on insert in the toolbar, and it should be there, and ought to automatically insert it. Or try rich-clicking inside the footer and 'insert' or 'page numbers'. 

Sorry, I use Open Office. Haven't use Word for many years. 




 PM me the plot I might be interested. 




 What is this? 




 Hundreds of enemies? Now I'm sure that's exaggeration, but let me clarify three things: Time, money, space. If you want a large tattoo you're going to need all three. Sure, you can get a giant one on your back or chest. But anything like that could take god knows how many sessions which ups the price exponentially. 

Titan doing wall of dawn and the quote is fine. Just think about what you want and where, and what it might entail.

Also, don't forget you might not like the game when you're older. You really have to think about the future with a tattoo as niche as a gamer tattoo, and with as much detail as the one you want. 




 I have Advanced Warfare on XB1 - that's the same thing right? Run around and shoot guys?

Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, Mass Effect and Brutal Legend (please!) ought to be added first. 




 Civ 5 




 New player. Only 3rd day playing Ukulele so any advice would be great.

The two I'm struggling with are: D, and Bm.

There isn't enough space on the neck to play the D chord, is there a more efficient way than using all three fingers? I'm always pushing one finger off the fret, so one string sounds muted.

Bm is just a pain in the ass, looking for hints and tips.

[This is what I'm learning to play](https://ukutabs.com/p/passenger/let-her-go/) 




 I imagine the term trilogy like the Von Trier trilogy. Or the *Cornetto* trilogy (Edgar Wright). Held together not by narrative but by something else - team, or director.  




 Gaming. I would go into gaming.

Probably programming.  




 [Lux Aeterna - Clint Mansell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLJllk-0o6c) (From *Requiem For a Dream*)

[Requiem - Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi8vJ_lMxQI) (This has a surprisingly good build-up and climax)

Mozart probably isn't what you're looking for. But Lux Aeterna is the most epic song I know.

 




 Haha no. Just straight up chat. Back in the days before Facebook. 'Cause Myspace was, lets face it, pretty naff. 




 It's an old logo they used to use back in ye olde days on MSN. It's a yellow emoticon smiling wearing shades - like a cool guy. 




 I think anyone who has seen *The Truman Show* has entertained the possibility that they are in their own version.

*(It's real)* 




 Good point, well made. I think it stands though. It's an oversight, a fairly large one.  




 I would say the portal was too small. Not enough gravity to get through. 




 I got that on Dayz. Tried to be nice. No luck. I even tricked a guy into thinking I was a friend - he had ammo I needed. I got close and killed him. There was a guy running on a desolate road, coming towards me. We stopped, stared at each other, neither making a move. He turned his back on me - judging me as not a threat - and I took him out from behind. Shit does that to you. Gotta survive. And then, when I had a really good character. Good weapons, plenty of ammo and food, someone took a lucky pot shot at me with a sniper rifle - never even saw them or the gun. Just *boom* black screen. Buh-bai good character. I later found my corpse. Picked clean. 




 Iron man falling.

In space. 




 I had a dream about a mouse. It was a really messed up dream. Let me give you some backstory - just a little. There were two mice, siblings, and their mother. I had been looking after these mice all day, but they kept on running away. My day had consisted of myself looking for these two tiny mice. Just the siblings. Sometimes I'd find them, and they'd get away again. I had to look after them, that was really important. When they were lost I had to find them.

I don't know what happened to the one. But I was with people, and they asked me if I was hungry. So they went and got fish 'n' chips while I sat on a wall, looking on the floor for two mice. I hadn't seen them for a long time - and I was very worried.

Eventually the others returned and they passed me a folded up paper bag. I opened it up and out popped this nose shape. A tiny mouse shaped nose. But it had been battered and deep fried - like a fish.

I know that sounds fucking stupid. But as this tiny orange nose-shape poked out it hit me that it was the mouse. And then it hit me again that someone had fucking deep fried it. Had probably boiled it alive and battered it. And then someone had given it to me. Knowing full well I was meant to look after them.

I forgot about it in the morning. In midday I was reminded, I nearly broke down into tears. 

I don't think I've just felt so...helpless, like I've ever lost something so totally, and failed so miserably. Just opening that bag and seeing that nose, and being hit by so many realisations. It really fucked me up. I still get sad about that mouse, sometimes.

(H) 




 Yeah, like I said. I had a feeling RDR would be one of the most requested. 




 Red Dead Redemption. Though I don't expect it will take long for that to happen.

Otherwise Skyrim (an obvious choice). Or Brutal Legend. Because I can't get enough Brutal Legend. 




 Finished it now. I did enjoy it. Parts of it were quite smart, and it was well put together. It was a bit slow, but that wasn't a problem really.

I read most everything. As much as possible. 




 Get a bow. Recurve or Composite. Much more need to practice and put time in. Much more rewarding. Bow is the same thing the whole time but bow is very different. 




 Archery...Just buy a cheap bow and a target. Sorted. 




 Thankyou, sir. I will try this out shortly. (Not that I can play yet but it's always fun =] ) 




 I'm English, and straight. But my sister (and her girlfriend) are gay. I just think America has done a really good thing here. A stellar step forward. I know it hasn't been easy in America but they've done it now. And that's really important. 




 I've already joined /r/ukulele :) I'm sure I will be spending a lot of time there over the coming days.

Do I wanna know on Ukulele? How do? 




 I'll get help. I really don't trust myself to do this. I have friends who are quite musically talented, they should be able to change a string.

Because even though I love my purple ukulele, I will get judged for it. :) Maybe not too keen to take it into the shop to get strung. 




 Might not be a good store. They do bass and guitar and Piano. They sell Ukes, but I've never seen strings :/. Might have to go into the city. And isn't that always fun?...

Also, I have no idea how to change strings. I probably should, I do not. Would definitely need help. Which I could feasibly get from the internet but that isn't the same. 




 Probably buy nylon. That's what they usually are right?

So in all likelihood I'll wander into shop and buy whatever I am recommended. 

I have no idea what I'm doing :/ 




 Yep, I read the reviews. Best advice given was to get new strings. Ones that aren't goddamn plastic. I'm already picking up Jason Mraz's I'm Yours. Same four chords over and over haha. It's just so difficult to learn because it doesn't sound right because the strings sound awful.  




 You mean...that's a thing? 




 Haha. No, unfortunately it was the very boring E string.  




 I mean...my bass is ok. My bass is broken because my friend snapped a string while tuning it so he lent me his. So, even though I'm not playing it. My bass is nice. Just...needs new strings... 




 Yay! I've really wanted to learn to play for ages so I just though...Sod it, buy one!

So I bought the cheapest one Amazon and it just arrived. It's bright purple (which is kinda awesome), and the strings are plastic and shit - but hey, I got what I paid for (less than 20). So, if I stick at it, I'll go and buy some decent strings. And if I really stick at it, I'll buy a decent one and really go for it. For now I'm letting the strings rest (apparently they need a bit of stretching after tuning), so I'm gunna leave it alone for now and see how if it sounds any better later on. Whoot. Back to learning 'Do I Wanna Know' on bass.

Edit: it's really strange going from tuning a ukulele to tuning a bass...Like, *I have to stretch now!? This neck suddenly seems so long!* 




 JUST DO IT!

 The themes and ideas are great. I totally appreciate them, and what he was trying to say. But just...everything else missed it for me. 




 Yeah, that's the thing about Fahrenheit 451. It's pretty universally loved.

I just didn't like the writing or the execution. He had a great setting and a really good idea and it just...felt like he didn't do anything with it. But I think if I read it again I would appreciate it more. I went in I think expecting something different, so if I read it with my head in the right place I might enjoy it more. 




 Fahrenheit 451... 




 POKEMON!

The original version in the nineties, when there were 150 *good* Pokemon and that was it. 

Or it could have Beauty and the Beast. I would have been super young. 




 I don't think anyone else would go with it so well. 




 fowl fowles fowl fowle 




 To be fair, what else would I mix it with?

Two of my favourites. Fuck yeah! 




 Songs a bit loud, can't really hear your bass line. Video looked awesome though, good production values.

Is this song difficult? I've wanted to learn it but for some reason I've never got round to it (...contemplative silence...) 




 Coke. Coke is the sweet nectar of the Gods.

But also: Budweiser/Captain Morgan's. (Depends if I'm in a lager or rum mood)

 Don't blame the devs blame the publishers don't blame the devs blame the publishers 




 Erm, didn't you see "A Series of Unfortunate Events."

Tsk. 




 On the morning the last Lisbon daughter took her turn at suicideit was Mary this time, and sleeping pills, like Theresethe two paramedics arrived at the house knowing exactly where the knife drawer was, and the gas oven, and the beam in the basement from which it was possible to tie a rope.  




 Thus, another issue with the elite controller. The controls do seem to be able to be ported towards PC, but look built for console. I don't know what they'll decide. Other than recommending a controller. Which, obviously, doesn't suit everyone. 




 Generally the aim of a thing. If things are generally seen as high culture - such as books. That's so. However something done solely for the pursuit of money regardless of any art...

Maybe that doesn't declassify from high culture. Maybe it does. 

Same for anything. Film sequels made for bullshit money. Films are high culture, but are also art. 

I don't care who likes what. I don't have anything against twilight, or erotic fiction in general. If something is done for a purpose, great. If something is done for money, then it ought not be culture at all.

Yes, I've opened myself up to a lot of backlash. I know that's a flawed argument. I would rather support a low end-indie film like 'Ink' than a blockbuster film made-for-money like 50SOG. 




 Tyrannosaur. Heavy Scottish. Also a great film. I would link to the trailer but they removed dialogue and made it musical for the exact reason that international audiences couldn't understand it. 




 I guess with full controller support. I heard them saying that you would use the 'silver' button the XB1 controller - which is referring to the Elite controller. I hope it doesn't rely on you having that. That's a damned nuisance expense if it is.  




 These days high culture is mostly anything that isn't reality TV. Some people might exclude TV altogether. 

Mostly theatre. Some films (especially in cinema). Most books.  




 Didn't bother me as much in DA:I. I mean the first time I encountered them it was a dark cave and my fire spell illuminated the outline of a giant spider and I was like "fuck...get to the back, get to the back..where's my team!" Not a fun time. 

After that it was ok. I don't know why fantasy has such a hard-on for giant spiders. Like in Skyrim when that giant spider falls from the ceiling in one of the first story missions. FuckyouBethesda. 




 Entertaining books are high culture.  




 I can't work out if you're defending poor grammar or the book...

Hmm? 




 This grammar is typical of someone who read that grammatically illiterate piece of shit book.

That's my problem with it.

Books should be high culture. Not reality-TV-level bullshit.
