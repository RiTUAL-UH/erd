 Then lumberjack-off. 




  I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my push-ups. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, *I simply am not there.*

 lol this article literally has zero to do with politics. It's from a psychology website about an event which is a news issue and not a political one. The author barely even mentions anything political in the piece. All he does is list his new book at the bottom that he's plugging that goes something along the lines of "Beating back right wingers." This is definitely one of the worst posts I've even seen in this sub and that's saying something.

 "Yeah! Put 'em in a body bag, Johnny!"

"Sir, they're just children and this is a hospital."

"Well, the dead bodies *do* leave the hospitals in body bags before they head to the morgue, don't they?"

"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."

"Really? Would it be better if Johnny put 'em in a sleeping bag instead?"

 Africans sometimes kill albinos and harvest their limbs and organs for magic potions. Witch doctors in places like Uganda think that albinos have some special power or something and so they kill them and use their remains for voodoo magic and stuff.

 I'm just stopping by to say that the fact that no one in this thread has made a reference to *In Bruges* considering the title of this post is a disgrace. I award you all no points, and may God have mercy on your souls.

 There's a big difference between secession - which is the legal and constitutional right of states should they seek it - and killing Jews and invading sovereign European nations like Hitler did. Learn your history before you post your pandering, smug may mays for le wise teenage redditors who just got out of school for summer and just completed their first government/civics course.  




 Lincoln wanted to kick free black slaves out of America and send them to British colonies because he didn't want them around and because he "didn't want racial strife" in America. *Freed* black slaves. For the not-so-smart among us, that translates to what we know and refer to as "black people" in modern day America here in the 21st century. I guess wise redditors knew that already though. I guess Lincoln is racist? Even though he was on the side of The Union as their leader and freed the slaves like wise *progressive* and liberal reddit teenagers were told with such pride and conviction by their burnt out Baby Boomer high school civics and government teachers who forced their students to watch MSNBC political talk shows for homework each week and regularly voiced their disdain for The Tea Party and FOX News in class any chance that they got? I'll wait for wise teenage redditors on Summer Break to figure it all out. After all, I'm just a racist, dumb, uneducated redneck who clings to my guns and religion and hates Obama. I'm totally not a highly intelligent, well-educated White male atheist from a heavily liberal metropolitan area outside of the South who doesn't own a gun and who voted for Obama though, right? Right.

Sorry to interrupt your circlejerk here. By the way, Lincoln didn't really care about blacks much. He was opposed to slavery of any kind that enslaved a man or woman of any color, not just blacks. Big difference between him being opposed to slavery and that consequently meaning that he liked blacks or wanted them in America. Quite the opposite, really.

Try to come to terms with the fact that Lincoln and other American presidents and heroes were "racists" by the definition that redditors have of the word since some of them owned slaves and/or didn't think that blacks were equal to Whites. Good luck.

 This is sweet justice. She sues her former employer and hopes to win anywhere between 18-100 million dollars in damages.
She wins nothing and ends up having to give *them* money for unsuccessfully suing them.  









 I would post a link with more info from the site where I found this but it contains personal info and the names of students. The mods would likely remove my post (even though it's a mainstream news source) if I were to do that so I guess this is all the info that you will get. Oh well.
