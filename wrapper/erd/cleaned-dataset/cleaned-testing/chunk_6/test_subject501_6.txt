 This is incredible. I was so immersed in this video alone I was expecting the actual movie to start playing :( 




 I learned quite a bit from that. Thanks! 









 It really is the little things. 









 That's got to be the worst poster I've ever seen. 














 He is an awesome, awesome down to earth film critic/movie reviewer who is ultimately just a guy who loves watching and talking about movies.

 Enjoy! It's my favorite. 




 Is that...sarcastic or.....? 




 Yeah but I cant see how Mad Mac Fury Road is 'art'. It's a fun summer action movie. 




 I read that in his voice.  




 What he said. 




 Read it. Love it. Can't wait to the remake. 




 I agree with you there. But the supposive 'sexism' around Age of Ultron, 50 shades of grey and now apparently this is really quite pathetic.  




 This movie is going to be something. 'The Neon Demon' how does that not sound intriguing? Oh, it's also going to be violent and fucked up as hell. 




 This sounds so fucking stupid. 




 Oh boy, Ian McKellen....seeing that just brought a grin to my face. 




 Are you going to do a part 3? 




 I'm sick of this shit. Whenever a movie comes out there's always some controversy surrounding it. They're just movies for fuck sake, nothing more, nothing less. Enjoy them for what they are. 









 The fuck? 




 The.....The Fuck?

[here's](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3117504/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl) the IMBD synopsis. I kinda want to see this just to see what the fuck it's really about. 




 Beautiful film 




 What was the movie? I'm guessing Mad Max Fury Road. 














 It is a [copy](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/052610_dkrcover.jpg) 









 Wow, Hardy with that beard and haircut must meen that they are STILL shooting 'The Revenant' with Leo DiCaprio.  




 Oh man that just gets under your skin. 




 What the fuck was that first one about...? 




 Looking forward to the remake? 









 I'm not trying to emulate him, I never said that, I'm sorry If I even implied that. All I'm asking is how would someone go about doing that.

 Not a dream but in Year 3 my teacher came up behind me and whispered "I had a dream about you last night" and then walked off. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but as I've gotten older it has just haunted me more and more. No shit, she actually said that. 




 For those of you who don't know Tyler Durden is Brad Pitts character from Fight Club (1999).

How would you go about becoming someone like that? Giving up all your material possessions, fancy car, fancy house etc and just completely let go of everything and "let the chips fall where they may" as he said (?)

It's just something that sounds really interesting? How would you go about it?  




 Same here. And that short montage that follows of him shooting people. Chilling. 




 That was the point. Stuff like that happens all the time in The City of God. 




 Not one Studio Ghibli film? Really?

Or are all of these TV shows? 




 It is a powerful film filled with disturbing and horrifying yet unforgettable scenes, which stayed with you after your first viewing? 




 Does anyone know of any other gritty batman art like this? 




 Wait, Nick Fury wasn't always bl... ind in one eye? 




 John Wick was pretty good. For what it was. 









 I'm pumped as for this!

I'm seeing this in gold lounge. 




 Say goodbye to all your Karma. 




 That was me exactly except with the second star wars teaser.....and it was the night before my final uni exam -_- 




 I figured.  




 I knew what it was I was just a little unsure of what it symbolized. 




 Oh I don't know, maybe the guy who wrote and directed the first incredibles? 




 Tom Cruise always wants new directors for M:I movies. 




 What's that supposed to be? 




 :D 




 What's the third one? I know theres Finding Nemo and this... 




 He will be. Sam Jackson confirmed it. 









 Taking my Grandmother to see The Wolf of Wall Street two years ago. We were both expecting a gritty crime drama in the vein of Goodfellas or The Departed. Man oh man....NEVER again. 




 For example there is an edition of Death of the family that comes with a Joker latex mask. There's another one for The Court of Owls that comes with a COO mask. I just wanted to know if their are any other editions like this or similar? 




 Hahaha 




 Now THAT is Mad Max. 




 It's Tyler holding a bar of soap. 




 Now THAT hits like a fucking bullet train. 









 My post or the one you just posted? 




 What? hahaha

  *Plot? It's X-rated, it doesn't need a plot.*

Hilarious! 









 I think it needs to be updated. You should remove a few movies from the list as I have not seen hardly any people talk about some of them.

Also, I've been noticing some increasing circlejerking over famous cinematographers such as Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki. You may want to crack down on that before it gets out of hand. 




 Seen it. Love it. 




 Romantic Comedies that are extremely well written that deal with disfunctional people and/or families or other similar themes. Thanks! 




 Wait, so do they mean all that stuff about Nolan and Tarantino being gods and moon and interstellar being like the best films of all time? 




 /r/moviescirclejerk? Yeah what's with them?? 




 DESTROY-E 




 Also, who decides what or who gets circle jerked? 









 Hey Dr. Z!

Just a quick question, why do teenagers or kids bully others? 




 He was good in the small part he had in unbroken. Maybe David Ayer can straighten him out in Suicide Squad. 









 This'll dominate the oscars. 




 What is that from? Please tell me. 




 If anything, your comment just spoiled it. 




 Spirited Away. Of course. 









 I see what you mean. Btw, how do you get little thumbnail superhero symbols like that? I can see you have Iron Fist as yours, how do you think of the upcoming show will turn out? 




 Im at a war with myself over whether or not to watch it. Is it good? Should I watch it? 



















 Goblet of fire.

Each tournament is a climax in itself. 




 I can't believe I actually clicked on this. 




 /r/documentaries should help you more than us. 









 Hi Mark, I love your work! You are hard to pinpoint as an actor because you are so diverse and are always choosing new and different projects, I love it! You were great in Avengers and Foxcatcher, I cannot wait to see Infinitely Polar Bear!

I just wanted to ask you, what are your thoughts on the recent outburst of criticism against Joss Whedon regarding Scarlet Johannson's character, Black Widow? 




 Really? 




 It was shot on film, that's why it looks a little hazy. But I can asure you that that's a 1080p screenshot 









 All good dude! Enjoy, It's a good one! 




 The Cabin in the woods. It must be.

Awesome movie. 




 You have a point.  




 Spiderman 3 (I grew up with it) 




 John Wick, The Raid 1   2 and almost any marvel movie that isn't Iron Man 2 or 3. 




 Have you read the Dark Knight Returns? 




 And then to a boxing movie! (Mike Tyson biopic w/ Jamie Foxx) 




 This brought a smile to my face. 




 I can see pennywise there. 




 I've been waiting for this for years. Is this guy a good actor? 




 I think Adam Driver will do an excellent job as Kylo Ren. We know absolutely fuck all about him, but the dude looks intense. 









 Okay I need to watch this right now. 









 I think Adam Driver will do an excellent job as Kylo Ren. We know absolutely fuck all about him, but the dude looks intense.

Come on guys, It's Star Wars for fuck sake. 




 FINALLY SOMEONE!!! 




 **Inherent goddamn Vice**

This is a movie that just gets better everytime you watch it. I have no fucking idea what's going on half the time, but neither do half the characters in the movie and I bet Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't quite know either. And that's the beauty of it. 




 Who did they all discriminate against? 




 But where they a fascist regime?  









 /r/mildyinteresting 




 That is all. 




 "where's the Joker?"

-You're kidding me 




 American Beauty. An aspect of it anyway. 




 The Infinity Quintopher Nolantino Kinography Cininenbotography Anti-pleb Gauntlet.  




 Nope. New story. 




 Tim Curry as Pennywise from IT. That fucker fueled my nightmares for 10 fucking years. Can't imagine what the remake's gonna be like. 




 Enjoy! its a good one! 









 Where the Nazis more fascist than the standard definition of Fascism? 




 I want to gouge out his motherfucking eyes. 




 She just [looks](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2014/01/margot_robbie_gg_p_2013.jpg) like Harley Quinn. 




 You motherfucker. 




 Heart attack stack. 




 Compliance and Jacob's Ladder like you said. Also Se7en and anything else that Fincher has done. 




 Cabin in the woods, Clown, The Babadook.
