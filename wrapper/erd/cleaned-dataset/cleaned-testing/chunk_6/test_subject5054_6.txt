 Shiner and German Chocolate Cake. Thank you German Texans. 

 




 What was so great about them? 




 They can be baked or fried.

 Nah he was just pushing it up like a push pop and kind of scrunching down the sides. Pretty ingenious if you don't have a spoon.  




 Though you're being sarcastic, I am truthfully a kind person. I might falter occasionally but it's something I believe is a very simple way to positively influence your immediate surroundings.  

Any who, he's not the subject, focus or punch line; the morning box of chocolate ice cream is. And my first thought was, "what's that dude eating", followed by "can't be ice cream", followed by "wow it is ice cream", followed by "I should take a picture", followed by "I want some now". 




 "Maybe there's one deeper, I'll just stick my dick in there and wiggle it around a little to make sure." 




 I've just never seen anyone eat straight out of a big box of ice cream like a push pop, at 8:30 AM and in public. Found it amusing, no judgement.

He honestly didn't seem healthy though. He was slurring when he was talking to the bus driver and was doing what looked like the heroin nod when he wasn't munching on his box.

Could have just overdosed on chocolate though. 




 Technically it's also ice cream after dinner. 




 You should have seen him when he was done.

The epitome of "I've made a huge mistake" face. 




 There's usually a wait on weekdays, it's just not an hour. Usually like 20 minutes. Maybe not in the summer though. 




 How much do you think letting go of Mankins contributed to this?  




 Oh my gosh, fake internet points I totally don't care about. Better whine. 









 That's Spurts for ya. 




 Transformers 4 has grossed a billion dollars though... 




 Like your mom. 




 Implying you are now OK with it? 




 I love to think that my mom doesn't lie when she calls me handsome. 




 If you're hung over every weekend for the past 7 years like clockwork, you're an alcoholic. It's OK, we've all been there. I've been there. I just don't have the same quick recovery time I used to so I had to cut back. It's not a bad thing, it's just a thing. But yeah I'm probably sheltered for pointing out that you spend 1/7 days a week hungover and that's not an outlier (which for your age range probably isn't - but this isn't just your age range).

 




 Do you know what average means? You obviously cover the high range. A lot of people obviously cover the low.

Not that it's not bullshit, but just because you're an alcoholic doesn't mean everyone is. 




  Here in Canada and the US, we pretend we never even had concentration camps, and ours didn't even involve genocide.

Huh? Learned about internment camps in WWII in middle school and high school. 




 To invent your own life's meaning ***is not easy***

Apparently it wasn't easy to read to the end of the comic, either. 




 Can you expand on that at all or are you just being contrary? 




 Define douchey.  




 But think... you might not have such a high regard for the brand if not for those contracts.  




 If you have to ask... 




 Except you know, all the rich people that don't live like that, of which I'm guessing is the majority. But yah... 




 I mean, you're spending over 100,000k min to buy a fucking status symbol, it's inherently snobby. There are cheaper cars for the performance value but people don't usually buy Ferraris for the 'raw power'. 

It's astounding to me that the majority of commenters here are surprised that a company that caters exclusively to the the rich is snobby about their product. *They fucking have to be.* 




 Not really. Brand integrity is crucial to their business model. It's stupid to not read what you sign though, yes.  




 They're not coming to Texas period :( I hate when that happens and I just don't understand why you wouldn't include Houston, Dallas or Austin in your tour. It's not out of the way between the West and East coast and there are a lot of people here. 




 Well, it says that exact thing on the song page, so there really isn't much to argue about.

To commence - one of the oldest and rarest tracks from an at the cutting edge of sound - Flume.

from the link. 




 Acorns freeze, pecans don't. If it freezes, it's an acorn. 




 Kind of the opposite really.  




 Here's some advice, don't let it get to you. Don't assume something that's just gonna make you annoyed. Why? 




 If only people could just ignore the things that they've already seen, or at least stay out of the comments so that the discussion isn't centered around how "we've already seen this; we already know this." 




 It's just a bunch of lame whiteys. You're better off not going. 




 He's basically a spider man clone, but a little different I guess. It came out in the past couple of years. Don't know much about it just know that he's a new marvel super hero based in Houston and based off of Spider-man. 




 It's almost like people learn things at different points in their life. And it's almost like everyone doesn't see every single post ever posted to reddit. But thanks for letting us know you already knew this and for constructively contributing to the conversation. 




 I know. I expected them to be bland and uninspiring, like Flacco. 




 Joe Flacco's wooden personality led to the colossal failure of McDonald's Mighty Wings. He is so stiff and boring that even Colin Kaepernick's movie star looks couldn't carry the ad campaign. 




 k 




 It's not a pecan and it's not too big to be an acorn because it is an acorn. 




 Nah it's an acorn. Freeze it right when it hits the floor. Clearly not a pecan. 




 Ah yes, the episode with the Randy Newman.  




 Probably the other way around. That was published in 2012 and the chicken gag started in the first run of Family Guy so sometime in the early 2000s.  




 Lefty was my favorite :'( 




 Grooming and abuse from what another poster said.  




 Oh. Darn. 




 Yeah it's not the same, the toaster over is better.

Makes sense, pizzas are born in ovens and not on stove tops. 




 Way more fun than the broken record that says "You must be fun at parties". 




 Damn thought I had top /r/NBA scorer on lock. 




 280 PPG and 5.85 Assists.

God? 




 I did the skillet thing for a little bit, but the toaster oven is just much easier, same result, and no extra cleanup. Can even throw the broiler on for a minute to brown the cheese. 




 Throw it under the broiler for a minute. 




 That's not a movie... 




 Half siblings =/= step siblings.

I think half siblings have the same genetic similarities as 1st cousins. 




 It's because procreating with someone you share familial genetics with (i think up to 1st or 2nd cousin?) has a pretty high chance of resulting in a genetically insufficient baby. And also the taboo factor. 




 I legit don't care about your sleeping habits.

Shares sleeping habits. 




 What if she was also black out? 




 Well, horseradish with mustard, starch and green food coloring.

Wasabi is hard to grow and cultivate, so most places outside of Japan feature the horseradish surrogate. 




 I think you really saw the brilliance of BB's coaching when Brady went down a few seasons ago and they managed 11 wins with what's his face. 




 Ha no I know. He's definitely a great coach. Definitely one of the best, and is one of the best 'talent managers' any sport has ever seen. The most talented team doesn't always mean they're the best team, but he made sure they were. I do however believe that from an Xs and Os standpoint, Pop is the front runner.

You don't just stumble into 11 championships by being a so-so coach though. 




 Well 8 of his 11 championships featured a player named Michael Jordan. 




 Man it would be so embarrassing if people knew I looked at naked ladies online. 




 I've heard way more vocal support for it's preservation into something usable. 




 Gotcha. 




 You said they can start buying houses after they go around the board once. Or I guess you just meant in the general construct of time.  




 : 




 Alert alert: alert 




 Duh alert: duh 




 I can't agree with that just based on the staggering amount of talent that was dumped in his lap. Now I think it takes a very special kind of coach to be able to lead those types of players, but I don't think he's as good of a coach as Pop. 




 But he isn't an editor. He's a random guy posting an article to a news aggregator site populated by pedantic, finicky assholes. 




 How can you buy houses without a monopoly? 




 It's not the key, it's the exploit of a broken game.
 




 It could have been worded better.

Your title is worse though.  




 Health advisory: I don't really give a shit.  




 A warning about Russia. 




 You just have poor reading comprehension apparently. 




 the 's after general is possessive. This is a general's(there's that tricky **'s** again) warning about Russia, hence 'General's Russian Warning...'

 Same but apparently it was a shit hole for the last 5-10 years. Not as big a shit hole as a grass field but still pretty shitty. 




 "It's my first day"

quack quack quack quack quack 




 i fucked off a while ago. 




 OK Good. I knew I wasn't going crazy and that I actually had tickets to Wolf Gang and Sir Sly tonight. 




 ok 




 ok 




 fucking off now. over and out. 




 Sounds like the city is their target. 




 ok. fucking off. 




 Yeah yeah I know.

:P 




 It's almost like I was countering his anecdote with my anecdote.  




 all hail the gluteus maximus. 

it's how we were able to survive where neanderthals failed.

we used to hunt by literally chasing animals to complete exhaustion.
 




 RTFA 




 ok 




 ok 




 Small shops have always tried way harder to sell me things I don't need, provide services that aren't necessary and just straight up lie about a non-existent problem so they can work on my car. 




 You realize I'm only replying to you and if you simply stop responding to me your wish would come true, right? 




 :D 




 Which is what happened to McCoy a few seasons ago.  




 "Huh, cuz you never really think about those other countries as having their shit together" 




 The system didn't crash it; lack of communication did. If everyone had used Imperial there wouldn't have been an issue and obviously the same applies to if everyone had used metric. Communication is important. 




 Yeah and which country put it there? It's almost like we're able to coexist with both Imperial and Metric.  




 Right-o good chap.  




 Over and out.  




 OK. Shutting up. 




 KK, sorry. 




 I think we're more like Tom Cruise, arguably the biggest action star in Hollywood's history with just enough craziness and chinks in the armor to warrant some mockery.
