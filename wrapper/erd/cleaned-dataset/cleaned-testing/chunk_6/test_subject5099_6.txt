 * ~~Bows in DvZ are not using spell damage, so they're just glorified vanilla minecraft bows, and don't do any real damage.~~
* ~~Roamin is spawned as the Default hero, instead of Bruce.~~
* Armor takes more than one durability per hit from zombies.
* Dwarven Runeblades use the Lightbringer Textures.
* and btw, 30 Dwarf games are still a thing, why? 




 :L I'm just passing by. 




 Throughout time this happens quite a bit, UltraSoftcore had its time, Mystery teams had its time, and right now Cutclean has its. This happens all the time, it will go away eventually.
 




 15 soon 16 




 The server isn't full, why can't I join? :/
 




 possibly whitelist me? IGN: test_subject5099
 




 make sure you are not using 1.7.9 




 As far as I know, this isn't true, what actually happens basically, is if you hit a mob, then hit it twice more, you can 3 shot it, however, if you hit that mob twice, another person must hit it 3 times, because your shots did not hit 3 times in a row to kill it. 




 Disabling gapples and gheads for this could make it even better :P 




 Can't forget MotherNature, or the other one off events like the RiddleMaster or other such events :P 




 Personally I don't even have fun surviving.
 




 and I know that you know this, I'm saying your request isn't really going to be fulfilled, because it's going to be completely overhauled soon anyway :P 




 if you look at the greeting messages, it is not actually out of beta. Power Juice in its current form will never be out of beta, only the upcoming arcade version will be "out of beta". 




 I'm sure when the next update comes, and Power Juice is changed to an Arcade game, then it will be available for all, and the server will no longer be in beta. 




 I've always perceived this rule as: if you are purposely doing something to inhibit anyone's game on purpose, this is bannable, such as putting a roof over someone's head or digging them into the quarry. If it is done as an accident, and they are unaware of the bad their actions cause, I don't think this is bannable. This is my interpretation of the rule, I'm sure others have their own. 




 there won't be another KGM update, as you can see [here](https://trello.com/c/FPXkf3cW/87-wizard-school-tournament) and [here](https://trello.com/c/Dbgnb2OZ/89-classic-golden-monocle). This is because the entire gamemode is being overhauled, and will be completely different. KGM will no longer have leaderboards or titles, but will instead be transferred to WZT or Wizard School Tournament. 




 You killed that player before, and he must have suicided at some point, so you were credited with the kill, even as a zombie. 




 You are mistaken, the one in red is ry1234567 before he changed it to black, the one in the penguin suit is deathbot. What I think is funny is they're not even trying to get the LightBringer, that sword there is Excaliju, Bruce's sword. 




 and Deathbot  




 DeathSeekerJT, part of the DeathSeeker lineage, those who can use the silver blade of Orion, one of the most powerful swords ever created, blinding monsters with it's glint. Only one DeathSeeker can live at a time, and for millennia one family held the DeathSeeker title, until their last heir died and Orion keep. JT was sent to find the sword, and in the process of escaping the keep, found the blade could be used in his hand, becoming the DeathSeeker. (Also has Brenna, a bow acclaimed for it's explosive power, not as cool a story as Orion :P) 




 To take a quote from rob himself, "The masses don't know what they want."
 




 it's been a long time, but i'd love to be in it! :D test_subject5099 




 This^
 




 Precisely the reason I left that game. 




 test_subject5099 and YetiiWho92
 




 test_subject5099 and YetiiWho92 




 3 Thank you :D  




 Me and Yetii were wondering if you do one of her, could you possibly put both of us in it? If it isn't that much of a hassle. :S I don't mean to sound demanding, I love the art, we were just wondering :P 




 They do get damage immunity, however, because their death is by a spell, they can be "tagged" by a player, and when they blow up it registers as a kill. This works for all mobs that die a suicide type of death, like Seppukus. so it appears like they have no immunity if you just looked at kill feeds, but they do have it. 




 ry of the gym beta never forget. 




 Check Rob's twitter, it's there somewhere. 




 I won anyway ^^
 




 Salogel is a part of the cats, and we do not participate in such activities. - JT of the Cats 




 They always tell me to get a room  




 There's a difference between a real argument, as you explained, and a role play argument, as wolfboy explained. 




 Void, if you fall in you just get teleported back to spawn. 




 It's not. 









 You won't be getting that helmet back. 




 And for this, they risk getting banned. This is an exploit, and it is bannable. Warn them, or don't, but they can be banned for having two sets. 




 fixed. Saw some myself, just was took a bit to change it. 




 The protection is not as intrusive now that the creepers you are shooting don't have invulnerability, and the mobs don't drop right on your head, so it isn't as difficult to not walk into the zone. This area technically is still farther than it was when the protection was first introduced, but less than when Nis moved it back.
 




 No, what it means that you can't throw armor, you can't be rearmored ever. You will always have armor in your inventory, unless it all breaks, so you can't be rearmored. RNG is Random Number Generator, how a lot of games make things random. 




 As I stated above, I mean the Diamond armor, any piece. 




 I mean your full set of diamond armor, if you throw it out of your inventory, any piece, it will teleport back into your inventory. Be sure to click around your inventory to find it, and if it doesn't appear, it can take a while to appear. 




 After several Test games run by Nisovin, a very small update was rolled out to Dogekac and Daragor, plus a removal of a certain mob.

* **Dogekac** was known for having a large amount of **holes in the bedrock** to bypass certain areas, such as at the front of the keep, there being holes under the lights, straight to the Inner Shrine. **These holes are now filled in.**
* Speaking of **Inner Shrine**...It **was removed**, there are now two shrines. The Bridge Shrine, and the Final Shrine.
* **Daragor's mob spawn was pushed back**, the tools tables were moved slightly over, and many trees were added abouts the front. The **mob protection is slightly forward**, to about **4 or so blocks infront of the shovel table.**
* ~~Unless the RNG was being very harsh to the **Spider Kings** in the games I played, they are **removed.**~~  *Saw some in a Dogekac game, JT is wroooooooooooooooooooong.*
* **Armor is not throwable anymore**, it will teleport back into your inventory.  ~~This means you CANNOT be rearmored.~~ *Unless, of course, all of your armor breaks.*


* You can now be rearmored if you are missing a piece of your armor, such as a helmet, and it will be re-equipped. No need to drop all your armor anymore. (Thanks Nis!)
 




 My setup:

1. Pot 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Pot 5. Shield 6. Pick 7. Cobble 8. Glue 9. Torches

The reason I use two pots is because when I played on the UHC reddit, I liked to have pick, sword, bow. So I was never accustom to changing that system and using hotkeys, so I prefer to keep my bow and sword together.  




 Yes! someone else that uses two potions :D 




 Oasis is out of the rotation, and has no indication of returning. 




 Something that I had heard, is that Nohdalag would eventually get flame as an attribute, which doesn't do anything because zombies have fire resistance, but it would look pretty cool. I know this was a planned thing, but never actually put in place. 




 Another Hero idea I had was the ShepherdofFire, a hero that has the Staff of Hellfire, that creates lanes of flame around its target, just to look cool. He also spawns with 5ish one use items, that are very overpowered, but hurt the dwarves too, such as killing all the monsters at once, but also killing a few dwarves, or giving every dwarf a 30 second proc, but unarmoring half the dwarves too. The Shepherd of Fire may have 10 items that he CAN spawn with, but may only relieve 5 or so, making every Shepherd unique. 




 DeathSeekerJT: Uses his own bow, Brenna, a one shot bow that causes the explosion animation and if it hits a block, breaks it. He uses Orion, the silver blade, that deals more damage than a runeblade but not as much as Excaliju, and when it procs, produces large amounts of fireworks that blind the monsters (this may or may not work, depending on if it crashes players or not). Orion is passed down by DeathSeeker lineage, and only one that uses the blade, can have that title, and only one DeathSeeker can exist at one time. 




 That was my idea too D:

 




 This change was today, the 27th, and not yesterday, the 26th. 




 More balancement changes, and reintroduction of an old map.

* Daragor has been readded, using the multiple shrine system, has 3 shrines: the Gate Shrine, the Juice Shrine, and the Final Shrine, each on a layer of the map.
* Armor, when repaired, gives 160 durability per repair, rather than 100 from before.
* When dropped, an armor piece ends up in oblivion, and is gone forever. (Remember, if you require a new set, throw away ALL of your old set.)
* Mount Willakers' shrines were reduced to two: the Courtyard Shrine behind the front wall, and the Final Shrine.
* Each map has a monster spawn debuff/protection, that deals a dwarf nausea and a bit of poison if within the radius. (This has the unfortunate effect of blocking dwarves from the cave on Dogekac, unsure if intentional or not.) The debuff is the same amount of nausea, but the poison starts as a very low amount, and then after about 5 seconds, becomes poison III.
* Dogekac's lobby is no longer destructable.
* **As of the 27th,** Dogekac's shrines were changed as well, to 3 shrines: Bridge, Inner, Final. **THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE** 




 Meh, not for me, but personal thoughts I guess 




 Lost my Pegasus Boots, great day yesterday. :/ 




 The Exact Opposite way JT would be, hooray! 




 Thing is, I would agree if the walls weren't literally behind the shrine you need to take, so once you get through, you die to the shrine field. Maybe with the new shrine placement they will be more useful, but atm, they aren't that good. 




 When the pigs fly and we all spawn with Excaliju, only then. :P 




 Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion.
