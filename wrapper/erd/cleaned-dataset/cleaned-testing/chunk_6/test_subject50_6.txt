Read the article: Connecticut has strict rules for attaching things to telephone poles that make it quick and the cost (sounds) fixed. Also half the state jumped head over heals for this.
Comcast is unhappy and still doesn't thing people need gigabit. 




 I used to always buy Intel, and it worked great. Still works great. My 7.5 year old laptop still runs very manageably for most things, including 720P video (1080P is a bit of a struggle). Then I read an article about how much of an asshole they are when I was working on an HTPC about a month ago. I went with AMD (they also have better integrated graphics IMO) and it's been running amazing and was probably half the price of a comparable Intel chip 









 Yes, exactly 




 So is this original theatrical edition, special edition, or special Lucas edition? 




 This seems cool for the elderly and those with lower leg muscular diorders/degeneration/other.

As an example person: when I was an RA in my undergrad, we had a girl who was usually in a wheel chair, but we would occasionally see her walking around (mostly just the building) with the elbow supported braces. Once she decided to walk to the Student Union. Not far by healthy individual standards, like a 2-3 minute walk. We had to call medical services to have someone pick her up/take her scooter to her because she was so exhausted by the trip she couldn't get up.
This would have helped her a lot, especially when she over exerted herself. 




 Why don't they ever combine these sorts of things with a battery rather than trying to replace the battery? Seems like you could store the charge in the (super)capacitor, let it discharge into the battery to charge that or be used by that in real time to slow the discharge.

Seems like if that worked all you'd have to do is tap your phone on the wireless charging mat for 5 minutes to load the (super)capacitor then walk away as it slowly discharges through or into the battery 




 Better farming practices would include implementing drip irrigation systems instead of flood irrigation where most of the water is lost to evaporation. Sure it would be expensive to implement, but the water savings and should pay for it quickly and the yield would not be diminished. 




 I can honestly say books are a part of the reason I'm with my current girlfriend.  *The Name of the Wind* and *The Wise Man's Fear* specifically. They kinda helped kick things off and get us to really start talking 




 No, it doesn't. If, for example, an army base has no walls or security than another army base, but people are trying to get into the other army base more often, it does not mean the first base is more secure. It means that fewer people want to get in. While that does mean a lower chance of being compromised, as you say, that does not mean more secure.

More secure means that if there is an attack, or whatever, you can block it and not be compromised. Maybe that's through being more difficult to infiltrate or some other method, but a simple lack of attacks does not mean more secure 




 Being in a rental, I think I have only CFL or LEDs, definitely not incandescent. I'm not sure how to tell the difference cause I can't see the inside (where the CFL coils would be) cause they're all frosted 




 The problem is that the studios won't accept the message that is being sent. To make it easily accessible and affordable does not make sense to them. If they did that, then RIAA and MPAA would be meaningless because people would actually pay a fair-market price and they'd have no one to sue. 

Also, based on the current model of people buying stuff they wouldn't get as much money, because more people won't buy a cheaper product (according to them). The same exact number will, cause that makes sense based on price.
