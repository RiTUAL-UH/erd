 Not no. 3. No 2 is a lie. 




 Aladdin was a really good film, and Robin Williams made it excellent. I miss Disney's hand drawn films... 




 I love animated films.



I use an iPhone.



I love Android. 




 But stock Android is aesthetically much better. 




 I would draw something today... 




 Baymax is the most lovable character :D 




 Do check it out, it's really good! 




 I loved Frozen as well! 




 Most of them aren't kid's movies these days. I am super-excited for Inside Out, which appears nowhere close to a children's movie. 




 Paperman is a really good movie. One of my favorite shorts, along with Feast. 




 Even I am a huge fan of animated movies! I prefer them over normal movies. 




 Up was awesome. I love most of the Pixar films. 




 Lion King is a classic. 




 But Fantasia 2000 was a disappointment :( 




 The Toy Story trilogy is simply amazing! 




 Aladdin was great, especially Robin Williams! 




 But it feels bad that Ego lost his job :( 




 Does it require proof? 




 Wall-E is amongst my favourite movies. A truly amazing movie, and my favourite Sci-Fi movie ever.  




 Musafa's death is the saddest part :'( 




 The Toy Story trilogy is truly awesome! 




 I've never seen a Miyazaki film :( 




 The Incredibles, like most of the Pixar films, is awesome. 




 I liked Wreck-it Ralph a lot, especially Ralph's and Vanellope's character. 




 Mine would be Big Hero 6 and Toy Story! 




 It's bloated and ugly. 




 The layer that Samsung puts over Android. 




 TouchWiz is bad. 




 TouchWiz. 




 implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed. 




 When are you planning to sleep? 




 Am? 




 What's the time at your place? 




 So, what's up? 




 Hey! Last night I was trying a difficult drawing, and I messed up :( 




 implying you shouldn't already have eaten them. 




 I love Vada Pav!

 #WHO THE HELL FLAIRED IT AS I/O IS LAME?  




 From what I have heard, Seoul seems madly populated, too... 




 BTW, is it the South or the North you are living in? 




 Cities here in India are madly populated... 




 We stay far away! 




 I have been obsessed with Disney and Pixar movies lately! 




 It's 7.38 pm here! 




 Still up?

KitKat




Hey, Grandpa!

 Big Hero 6  and Frozen! 




 I love the sub! Praise DuARTe!

 BTW, what does your flair mean? I can read Hindi, but I cannot understand your flair... 




 Flounder = Nexus 9 




 But overheating? 









 It's good? 




 I might see Dumbo now... 




 You should see it. It's excellent! 




 I just finished Pinocchio! 




 Hi! I am watching movies... 




 /uj Don't. The touch issues are bad. 




 **DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE**


*Moderators are a lost cause, only Lord DuARTe can save us now.* 




 I am on a Disney movie watching spree! 




 41C here too! 




 India... 




 41C at my place! 




 Almost Monday here :'( 




 Sure! I will PM you once my college starts :) 




 I will try to do that... 




 That's what I want to do! But let's hope I can get there... 




 What are you planning to pursue? 




 I kinda attend often. Like, once a month... I am there for 10 mins or so...  




 I visited a temple today! 




 7pm here! 




 It's evening here :) 




 Even his face is a bit similar! 




 Even I am loving this site! 




 Yes, the expressions of Genie were amazing! And he looks kinda like Williams, too! 




 I'm fine! What about you? 




 His Genie's role is my favorite, though! 




 Yeah, but the movie was disappointing, not befitting to an actor of his calibre. The first part was excellent, though. 




 Sorry, the last one o saw was night at the museum 3, which was pretty disappointing :( 




 The last Robin Williams movie I watched in the theaters was Night at the Museum 2... 




 The voice of Robin Williams is excellent! 




 India. 




 I watched Aladdin yesterday, and I loved it too :) 




 I just saw Big Hero 6 and Tangled, and I loved them :D 




 Saw any movies lately? 




 Hey, what's up? 




 It's almost 3 PM here... 




 Yes, it's 2.15 pm here... 




 Even I loved Elsa's character! I just drew her, too... 




 Yes! 




 Unfortunately, my exams were going on when it was released :( Now, I plan to watch Frozen again... 




 It's 10.55 AM here... 




 I am curretly on a Disney movie watching spree... In 5 days, I saw Tangled, Big Hero 6 thrice, and Aladdin... 




 Yes, nearly opposte ends! Saw any movies lately? 




 India. Where are you? 




 It's 10.40 AM here! 




 I am fine. too :) What's the time there? 




 Tom's Hardware's Android 5.1 performance test apperars to be surprising, as I found the real-life performace of 5.1 much better than 5.0. It's silky smooth with no frame-rate drops.   




 Hi! How are you? 




 I think it might be either Tintin or Baymax for me! 




 Abki baar DuARTe sarkar. 




 ICS


Damn, he's... DuARTe. 




 Do you deem yourself worthy enough to wear them?
