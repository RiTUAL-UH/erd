 I guess I'd respond with, sure bag/bank slots or costumes are great and all, but why spend time designing those items and then NOT give them in-game as recipes to help your crafting patrons.  
Stuff in cash shops like that usually just undermines social aspects, why ask a friend to craft you a larger bag when you can just plop down $5. And then it hits you, that had to be determined pretty early in the design doc's and you start to wonder if the devs really are making a game and not just a cash machine. I understand they need money to keep the lights on, but sometimes I just scratch my head at the things lost with pay-2-convenience. 




 thanks for the laugh op
