 You're certainly trying to stuff a lot of Florida into one week!

I'm a Florida native, and I've lived and partied and visited pretty much the whole state.

All the alligator stuff is Everglades/South Florida stuff, including the airboat tour. Very cool, very fun. If you can afford it, get a private trip instead of one of the public tours. The public tours are bigger boats, seats for anywhere between 12 and 20. The private ones are you and a guide, out in the swamp, on a smaller (and faster!) boat. Eating alligator is a Florida tourist thing. You can get that at just about any decent seafood restaurant. It's best blackened with cajun spices, if not that, then fried. Step it up a bit, and look for Gator Jerky when you're in South Florida. That's some good stuff.

Kennedy Space Center! I love KSC. Very awesome, super sciency, can experience the whole place in half a day, but if you want to do any of the longer tours, or have lunch with an astronaut (Really!!) plan on a whole day. Surfing you definitely want to do on the East Coast. Cocoa (near KSC) has some great surf spots, head north to New Smyrna Beach (the birthplace of Florida Surfing, and home of one of the longest surf clubs, the Surfari Club. *Full Disclosure: I live in NSB, I'm partial to the scene here.

Crystal River/Blue springs is awesome. Your Canadian? So maybe your used to cold, but swimming the springs in Feb is not something that this Floridian would do. Check on that swimming with a manatee thing, pretty sure that's illegal everywhere in FL.

Sarasota is alright, the museum is really the standout, the Ringling Museum of Art is the home of quite a few masterworks. Great trip down there from the Tampa/St. Pete area as well. The Sunshine Skyway bridge that takes you over the mouth of the bay is Florida's tallest bridge. If you have time, stop at the little gift shop place on the north end of the bridge, and learn about the Skyway Disaster....a boat struck the bridge causing a collapse and the death of 35 people.

St Pete is great. I grew up in the area. Make time to get to the Bayfront...it's the touristy sort of area of St Pete. Very pretty. Make time for the pier. You like the Ringling in Sarasota, you'll love the Dali Museum in St. Pete. 

The beaches are great on the gulf, but I'm an East Coast guy now, so I'm partial to the beaches in Florida that don't smell like dead fish. Personal opinion, and hot topic for debate here...which side of the state is better.

North to Tampa to find Ybor city for the Cuban, the cigars, the brewery. Have fun at the strip club.  









 In the pictures that you show, it's speciation. Certain types of shrimp will cook to a different shade of pink, or even orange. Also, within species of shrimp, diet can change coloration by quite a bit.  




 In other news, my Christmas list now includes body armor.
 









 Do you have the video of the absolutely epic beatdown that guy must have received after doing that to that dude? I would whip him like heavy cream. 




 We do have a medical movement, and it looks like it might make the ballot, but the voting blocks in the center of the state and the north of the state are ultra conservative, and the new folks moving in are generally moving into areas that are already democratic/liberal. Over time, change will come, but I just don't know how fast.
 




 Somewhere in the ultra-conservative, rightwing-religious middle states, most likely. I'm thinking Kansas. Unfortunately, here in Florida we won't be that far ahead of them, methinks. 




 I agree. Glad to see Turtledove on there twice, but none of my favorites are on there. Hard to chose when all he writes is althistory I guess... 







































 SUBconsciously....I'm doing that thing right now. Add a head shake to it, does that change the name? 




 Here in FL we have something called "Cottage Industry". Google that shit, if your state has something similar, you are allowed to sell a certain amount of certain items without hitting the threshold for the thousands of laws to kick in.

We haven't done anything, but we've looked into it for homemade sauces and rubs and mustards, and while I don't remember what the unit limit was, it was easily within the farmer's market saleability level, if that makes sense. 




 Funny. I use this gesture often. Both unconsciously when I'm thinking, and as body language to show frustration. It never occurred to me that it might have a name. Saving to see if anyone comes up with it. 




 She's upset that you're happy? You guys split, mutually, to be frank, it's none of her damn business if you decide to get over and be happy. If you're trying to rekindle, then I would be careful how you present yourself, but if you're happily unmarried, then be happily unmarried. Her opinion shouldn't matter anymore. 




 Those are all very attractive representations of something that I don't find attractive at all. Plus one for calling it "resting bitchy face" though. 




 Two ways.

Before sexytimes. Bring up sexytimes in casual conversations. Ask him if there is anything he wants that you're not doing, or special things he wants. If he doesn't ask you the same question back (shame on him if he doesn't) use that opportunity to mention it.

During sexytimes. Grab his fuckin' head, kiss him, tell him to lick your fuckin' balloonknot. NOW! (This would work for me if wifeypoo told me that, I would respond accordingly.)

Edit: Do not say balloonknot under any circumstances.

 I think AS is worth reading. It reads long...not exactly action packed, but especially today, with so many conservatives quoting Ms. Rand, it's important to know what they're quoting. Read it for that, if nothing else. 

Disclosure: Yes, I am a liberal, but I'll admit that I had to rethink some of my ideals after reading this book. I also reaffirmed many of my ideals. 




 At first I wanted some potato salad....and then things got weird. 




 Yeah, me too. I'm on every day, for about forty minutes, and most of that time is reinforcing previous learning, not learning new skills. 









 Yeah, that is not a hole out. Got to be **in** the basket
 




 Don't miss that next shot. 




 Yes. Stretch the skin and do so carefully.
 




 That's usually how it works. I guess it would have been better to say...if you think there is a chance, put the drink down and have some water, if you're there to get wrecked, don't chase tail. 




 Yeah, it happens. It has happened, or will, to just about every dude you know, so don't sweat it.

Tips: Don't drink so fuckin' much if you think you're gonna get laid. 









 It is sort of just Franks' plus garlic. Still delicious. I have so many hotsauces in my cabinet, sometimes I'm just choosing which shade of red I want to use. 




 Sharks are my goto utility/long-approach/fairway/ohshithowdoIgetoutofthisbush disc. I love 'em. Picked up a Shark3. Like it, don't love it. It's long...it's I think only one number higher in either glide or speed, can't remember off hand, but that thing sails. I use it as a steady straight short fairway utility, but just don't have much need for that in my game. I usually reach for the 3 when I hit an early tree, but have an umimpeded straight shot to the tee that's too short for mid-range but too long for approach. I often overshoot with this disc though. It sails easily, at least for me. I also use this disc for rainy days, as I can crank it off the tee, and the grip on that fat rim negates any slippy from the rain. 




 My wife and I were together for ten years, had two kids together, a whole life together and hadn't pulled the trigger on getting married.

We wanted to, we just hadn't gotten around to it.

I wanted to still surprise her, but I knew it would  be difficult, what with a shared bank account, a shared life, a shared house.

First, the ring. I enlisted the MIL. I had her bring prospective rings to my job, and I would look at them, and then she would bring me some more to look at a few days later. Once the ring was selected, I had a good friend hold on to it to keep it hidden, and as the ring I eventually choose was a heirloom ring, payment wasn't an issue.

I talked to the family without my SO's knowledge and planned a dinner so that her sister and mom and family at large could be there.

I had the sister involved in securing the restaurant and decorating...and also on some after engagement dinner party favors. That last part my SO was aware of, and she kept asking if she should go meet her sister, and I kept having to come up with excuses why that was a bad idea. (Mostly because she wasn't at her house, she was down the street at a restaurant near our house!). This led to my wife being a bit grumpy as to why I didn't want her leaving the house that day.

I asked her if she wanted to go get dinner, and kept it vague, telling her to dress up, and got her and the kids loaded up in the car and headed out.

When we pulled up in front of the restaurant, she started complaining...it was a nicer place that we hadn't been to  yet, and she didn't want "to go with the kids...we should go there alone so we can enjoy ourselves". 

I've got 12 people waiting inside, and a ring burning a hole in my pocket at that point.

I think I said that the kids and I were going to go have dinner, and if she wanted to come in she was welcome to.

When we got inside, she saw the family gathered, and thought that that was the surprise; that the family had gotten together for dinner.

I had a speech planned, blah blah blah, all this time together, blah blah blah....

All I said was "I knew that I loved you, and even after today, I know I want to do this." Got down on the knee, she said yes, restaurant clapped, wine from the manager, family had a great meal.

We were married on the beach four years ago. Our best friend officiated. All of our friends and family were there, and she hasn't been mean to me since. 














 Threatens by fax? Does North Korea even take North Korea serious? Who threatens by fax? South Korea should publish the source number of the fax, and then all of us could go to our grandparents house to use their fax machines, and send black pages to North Korea. We could break them in hours; problem solved. 

I'll accept my Peace Prize in person, thank you. 





























 Dibs on that as a band name! I call dibs!! 




 Thank you for that injection of ultrafunk into my otherwise boring day. You guys rip. 

Unrelated, but I checked out a couple videos of  yours on the Tube, (I really liked that Byrd cover, BTW) and eventually I got to a point where all the recommended videos on the right side were 9/11 conspiracy films... 




 Yeah, I'm a fan of that one.

I don't know what to tell you; I feel that it's worth reading through. More things happen towards the last half, good things, great stories, but the overall feel of the novel won't change. At its heart, it's just a story about a dude and the things that happen in his life.

Read it. Give it another couple chapters. I think you'll get more into it. 




 Insomnia. So many ties to the DT series. Start reading it now, and tell Ralph I said hi. 









 My fourth birthday party.

I don't have any other memories even around that early, at least anymore, but I remember a lot of things from the summer I turned four. 

I was born in July of  '72, and '76 was the Bicentennial for the USA. It was a big deal, turning 200, and everything, I mean everything, was red white and blue. I remember seeing flags everywhere, and the Fourth was pretty epic.

My birthday cake (about two weeks after the fourth) was red white and blue, and my presents were wrapped in red white and  blue and even the toys I got were red white and blue. 




 I'm terribly guilty of this, but I rarely waste food.

I like to shop without recipes/meals in mind...that helps me make value based decisions. Instead of going to the market and hoping to find a good price on a particular cut of meat, I can go to the market and find the best deals and worry about production later.

I also like the challenge of coming up with new meals every day (that I get to prepare meals at home). It's a nice game to play. Got to pull something out to thaw sometime after lunch, and that gives me about four hours to figure out what I'm going to do with it.

Saying that, I also don't buy "rare" items and/or speciality or expensive items without having some idea what I'll be doing with it later, and if something goes too long in the freezer without being used, well into the crockpot you go, and poof! STEW! 














 God save me from a steakum, and steakum style cheesesteak are possible proof that Satan exists. 

Absolutely valid, as most steak for a good, real cheesesteak are going to be hand cut, and you just can't achieve that thin of a slice with a knife and years of skill. 




 The Philly Cheesesteak is at its heart a steak sandwich. A *sliced* steak sandwich.

You could make a steak sandwich out of any cut.

You could, if you wanted, just put a hunk of chuck on a bun and call it a steak sandwich, but it would be impossible to chew. So sliced.

Meat has a grain, like wood. If you have to slice up some steak to grill, you want to consider the grain. You can cut cross-grain or with the grain.

With the grain, you end up with long slices of steak with the grain running down the length, meaning that when you bite into it, you would be trying to chew across the long grain (strands, if you will) of the slice. Think potroast, how it falls apart into those long strands, it would be like that, but nowhere near as tender. (We're not going to talk about grilled meats vs roasted meats here. There's something special about grilled meat, and when I want a cheesesteak, I want that grilled flavor, if I wanted something all tender and pot-roasty, I'll have a Carolina style BBQ sandwich.)

Across the grain, you end up with a long slice of meat with the grain running in short strands from the top to bottom of the slice, instead of along the long axis. (Think stacked, like a bunch of matchsticks in a row.) This is better. Your bite is separating strands of meat instead of trying to cut through them. Easier.

So, knowing this, why Ribeye? Fat.

Fat is flavor, for one thing. But maybe more importantly (like something could be more important than fat/flavor, right?) the places on each individual slice where there is fat, there will be a break in the muscle strands, or grain, providing yet even more ease when it comes to chewing. It provides probably the best grilled steak slices, as long as you aren't trying to avoid fat of course.

There may be a fair amount of tradition involved as well, but that's for someone else to talk about.

 i-Dye poly is available at most craft stores, and you can find it online. Just make sure you get the iDye that's made for polyesters not cottons. 

Mix iDye and water. Use slightly less than the amount of water suggested on the package for the stovetop method. No alcohol needed. iDye comes with a color conditioner in the package. DO NOT USE.  Mix up your iDye, toss it on the stove, heat it up to just below a simmer, turn off heat, let cool to the touch, dye away using the dip method or paint method. Dye stores in plastic for just about forever, you just have to heat it up to just below a simmer before using it again.

My only complaints about iDyes are that the colors are a little unpredictable. One dye and you have to let a disc sit for ten minutes to get a vibrant red, and the next dye it happens in two. Other than that I love this product. Better than old RIT. There's been virtually no fading on my Gold Line River, though I have seen some fading with use on some Innova Champion dyes that I have done.

[You can buy iDye just about anywhere online](https://www.google.com/#q=iDye+poly safe=off tbm=shop) or in a brick and mortar like Joanna's or Micheal's. (Hobby Lobby carries it as well I believe, but fuck Hobby Lobby.)

[Here's a link to an (old) forum post about the switch to iDye from RIT.](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/showthread.php?t=43518) It's a little out of date, but informative.

Happy dyeing. (This stuff is harder to clean up when spilled or dripped than RIT ever was because it dyes quicker. Be careful, keep some acetone on hand or be prepared for permanance.) 




 I did a gold line River with i-dye poly, and it's one of the best looking dyes that I have done. 




 The two most important things to remember about wind...

1. Wind acts on your disc like it would act on a wing. It's sort of counter-intuitive, but throwing into the wind results in an *increase* in wind speed, meaning your disc is *faster* and throwing with a tailwind means a *decrease* in speed, meaning your disc is *slower*.

2. Wind acts on your disc the most when the flight plate is exposed. Once you give the wind something to push, it will push it. So as your disc turns over, wind begins to work against the flight plate, either fighting or increasing any turn.


There's lots more about how your discs will work in the wind, and you have to go out and throw your discs to experience it. You can read up all you want, and that will help, but it won't make sense until you see it in action.
 




 Well.

I just don't know what to say about that.

I would say that I want my ten minutes of life back, but at the same time, I am completely willing to consider it a sacrifice to whatever YouTube Gods there may be to never allow me to watch something so confusing ever again.

Now, I am going to go drill three holes in a bridge over a creek, and stick my penis in them.

Thank you. 












































 Hmmmm

My personal opinion.

* Beast - Champion. 
* Beast - Pro, preferably beat in.
* River - Gold. 
* Shark - Champion, preferably way beat up.
* Anode - Proton. Because rubber rim grabs chains. 




 A very interesting point, and one that I feel that I partially agree with. I don't know if both behaviors are because of nature trying to control population though.

I also feel that this argument needs to be divided...pedophilia is the attraction to the *prepubescent* while ephebophilia is the attraction to younger partners that are generally post-pubescent, but socially immature. The two are very different.

There have been some societies that have accepted pedophilia, the ancient Greeks probably the best known of those, but there have been other societies that have punished that behavior.

Ephebophilia, however, has been generally accepted up until fairly recently. 100 years ago it would be completely acceptable for a 30 year old man to marry a 15 year old girl, and the expectation is that she would bear children for him fairly quickly. It is just recently, as our society has changed, that that behavior has become unacceptable.

So, does homosexuality, pedophilia, and ephebophilia share the same genomic process, or is it changing societal pressures that define these issues?

Homosexuality has been generally accepted through the ages. See above for ephebophilia and why it is accepted. So why has pedophilia not been as accepted through the ages?

In short? Consent and protective behaviors.

It is hardwired into us to protect our young. Society may be able to define when a post-pubescent child is "of age" but nature defines the line between child/adult differently; by the ability to procreate. Pedophilia is the attraction to prepubescent humans, humans that by no definition are adult, either societal or natural, and that makes them children. And our nature requires that children be protected.

So, I feel that homosexuality and ephebophilia are very related: both are fairly "natural" (for lack of a better word), both genomic, both acted upon by societal pressures. (Simply meaning that some of this behavior has been accepted or not accepted based only on how society at large feels about that otherwise natural behavior.)

Pedophilia however, is very easily viewed as an act of aggression, from an adult human to a child human, and biological processes require that we protect our children, making this behavior unacceptable to most of us.

Leaving that, I do not believe that nature intends a certain part of the population to be homosexual, I believe that it is natural for a certain part of any population to *be* homosexual. I think it is part of us. I think that it would happen among smaller populations as well. (I don't have links handy, but homosexuality was well documented in the American Indian, and accepted, and through most of their history they were not acted on by population pressures.) Ephebophilia is a natural behavior as well, the only difference is whether one follows the morality of the society that declares these individuals off limits or not.

Pedophilia seems to be more about power and dominance than sexual urges. More like rape than preference. I think many more studies need to be done to help us understand pedophilia, but it would seem that this behavior comes from somewhere else in the brain. 

 




 Don't know the story, but it's not King, I know everything he's written very well. 
























 I didn't know that food was supposed to taste good until I was about ten or so.

That's when I started spending my summers with my grandmother, and oh yeah, Gran could cook.

What dish did I hate as a kid? All of them. My mothers idea of cooking was from the "heating things that come in cans until they are hot" school of culinary preparation. No butter. No seasoning. Nothing.

Be ten. Take a can of green peas. Dump then in a pan. Heat until hot. Now eat them. Go ahead. I fuckin' dare you.

Those sad shriveled green balls of mediocrity would sit on my plate, mocking me, knowing as well as I that I wasn't leaving the table until I ate them, and also knowing that I would rather eat paste then have to suffer another victim of my mom's reheating.

When I spent my first summer with my Gran, I remember quite clearly asking what kind of food she got, because it tasted so different. Fried chicken (she used mayonnaise instead of egg wash, try it, amazing) home canned vegetables, field fresh vegetables, so good, baked hams, with brown sugary glazes, and sauces! I didn't know about sauces! BBQ ribs! Fish fries! Potato au gratin, homemade! Bythegods its amazingness was only overshadowed by its awesomeness.

And then I went home.

Those fuckin' peas were waiting for me. Not good. I was ten, maybe eleven, and I told my mom how good Gran's cooking was. (It was my father's mother) 

It was not received well.

By my third summer or so, I asked Gran to teach me to cook. I helped cook dinner at home by the time I was 14. 

Now I'm a professionally trained chef, working in the business, and considering taking my Gran's recipes and working a cookbook that combines her love of food with her love of family, geared for family cooking; recipes that mom or dad can make that go with recipes that the kids can cook as well.

Thanks Gran. I wish I told you how much those times in the kitchen mattered to me before you died. And Gran Rusty, you should know that I have a  batch of your icebox pickles in my fridge right now...they're still my favorite snack.

 nothing but spread. It just sort of hangs out doing its fungus thing, you know, being ugly, making you uncomfortable in situations where you have to take your shirt off. I had it on my chest and belly. 




 They're spreading. They get darker/more pronounced when you exert yourself. They're slightly raised. 

Yep, it's a fungus.

I can't remember what it's called, but I had it. The doc told me it was related to athlete's foot (causing some lovely jokes about atheletes body, which I don't have, but did).

Doc prescribed me some super expensive ointment shite, but as I talked the nurse on my way out she recommended that I try something else first.

Head and shoulders. The anti-dandruff shampoo, the regular kind.

Use it as bodywash for a week or two. See if it helps. If it don't, off to the doc with you.

*I'm not a doctor, but I play one on Reddit. 









 If you're sure that it's printed/screenprinted/heatpressed on, (there is no indentation and the printing is invisible on the reverse side) the only thing that I would recommend trying is pure acetone...not nail polish remover, just the stuff they make nail polish remover out of.

Pure acetone. Get it at yer hardware store.

Start with the corner of a rag dipped in acetone, and work a corner of the plastic to make sure it won't damage the plastic...as long as the plastic holds up, you're good.

Keep in mind acetone does not "dissolve" ink...in that it doesn't make it go away; it just breaks down the "fixer" in the ink that makes it permanent. You can loosen the ink with acetone and then spread it around your media. Use small amounts, and work small areas, acetone-ing small patches and then picking up the ink as you go with a clean towel.

Good luck, use at your own risk. 







































 The stupid is strong with this one.

Also, he's the former Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, primary House author of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and chairman of the House-Senate energy conference committee. 

Annnnnddd...he's probably not an idiot; he's just pandering to his base to protect his real constituents: the oil and natural gas industries.

And here is the actual quote from committee: "Wind is Gods way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where its hotter to areas where its cooler. Thats what wind is. Wouldnt it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, Im not saying thats going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something, you cant transfer that heat, and the heat goes up. Its just something to think about."

Oh yeah, and The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Congressman Barton on its CREW's Most Corrupt Report 2011, for not accurately reporting investments in the natural gas industry which profited him $100,000. 




 Your brother has weird hobbies. 




 I like my wife to shave completely every now and again....but mostly I prefer that there just is no hair in my way.

For me, it's because I'm visually stimulated, like most men. I like it shaven every now and again simply for the view; I can see all of her, and that's what I like. Overall, I prefer a neatly trimmed bush, trimmed just for the ease of oral. 




 It might not be you....I'm just not a fan of kissing. 

My wife and I have spoken about it, and come to understand it; I don't mind kissing, but open mouth sloppy making out, it's just not my thing.

Might be that, or it might be something about the way you kiss...or oral hygiene...but don't let that stop you from talking to her. You won't know if you don't talk, and if things are good between you, it can only benefit the two of you to sit and communicate about this issue.

 I grew up on the West coast of Florida.

All through high school, my friends and I were semi-amateur skateboarders. (Way before Xgames made it cool to skate again.)

Each summer, we'd take a trip cross-state to the East coast for some surfing, and to skate the East coast scene.

I wasn't much of a surfer, I preferred wheels.

I was talked into going out on a pretty rough day. I could get up on the board, but that was about it.

One particular afternoon, after many beers and some 420 happytimes, we headed out into the surf. 

I paddled out, caught a few waves, wasn't really feeling it, (I just wasn't much of a surfer) just ended up sitting the board outside the break and enjoying my state of mind and the weather and the waves.

THE PAIN WAS IMMENSE AND IMMEDIATE. Searing white hot pain across my calf. I had no idea what had happened, I went into instant panic mode...I honestly think I Jesused across the waves instead of swimming in.

In a haze of high and sun and beer and pain, I was running in literal circles on the beach, screaming about how my leg had been bitten off by a shark. Running in circles, *on two perfectly good legs,* yelling about my missing leg, and how much it hurt. 

After some friends, some passer-bys and some lifeguards got me calmed down, they determined that I got hit by a jellyfish. Nasty sting, nasty swelling leg, non ending pain.

After an overnight stay in the hospital, we aborted our trip and headed back home.

After the story was spread around my friends, and their friends, and parents and neighbors and mailmen and the guy at the quicky-mart, I went back to school that first day to mocking cheers of "What's up Shark-boy?" and "Hey! Shark-attack!" and that sort of thing.

I wore the nickname of "Shark" for quite a long time after that, and with some pride, and even though I have left it behind me, I still have some friends that refuse to call me anything else. 














 I can't help you with translation or correction, as your spanish is quite a bit better than mine. (I am just learning.) But you should know about [lang-8](http://lang-8.com/), a website that lets you post diary style entries and have them corrected by a native speaker. 

I've been using that site as a step past places like duolingo and memrise, and my learning curve has increased quite a bit. Give it a shot.

Also, well written piece on legalization.  




 Link takes you to thank you page at end of survey.  





























 Absolutely with the lyrical ability, but I was having trouble with the comment running away with me and getting wordy.

One of my favorite little nugget of Dylan trivia is that the one-time Poet Laureate Andrew Motion once said that  "Visions of Johanna" was the greatest song lyric of all time.  




 Liking Bob Dylan's music, and understanding his place in music history is sometimes two different things. You can have a great amount of respect for his songwriting ability, and the reach of his influence, and not like the way his music sounds.

I am a fan, I like his raw emotional sound, and the way he sometimes feels like rhythm and meter are options not requirements. A lot of people can't handle that voice of his, all gravelly and indistinct, but for some of us, that's exactly what we're looking for.

When it comes to Dylan's music, standing alone, you either like it or you don't. Just because you understand that he's the [most covered artist of all time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artists_who_have_covered_Bob_Dylan_songs), just because you understand that he basically invented folk-rock, just because you know that he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, that doesn't mean that you have to like the music.

It's easy to understand how he become such a fixture in the American psyche, not just for his music, but because when MLK gave his "I have a dream", Dylan wasn't in the crowd...he was on stage...having just sung "Blowin in the wind" and "Only a Pawn in Their Game".

He has the respect of so many musicians, and not just because of the body of work that he has produced, but because when other musicians at "Live Aid were preening their egos about how much they were helping Those Poor Starving Africans, he had the temerity to bring things a little closer to home by suggesting that perhaps some of the money might be used to pay the crippling mortgages that were putting American farmers out of business." Because of that, Willie Nelson was inspired to instigate Farm Aid. He also had the balls to take an electrified band on stage at the Newport Folk Fest, and after getting booed off the stage, keep working, and changed folk-rock. Again. After he pretty much invented it.

There's so much more that he has done, for music, for entertainment at large, that gives him a place in our music history:

He introduced the Beatles to Pot. (That was probably a good thing)

He dared to break the mold of the three-minute single, releasing six and seven minute songs.

Sure he's won Grammy's, but also won Golden Globes and an Oscar.

He took "The Hawks", turned them into his backup band, and gave birth to "The Band". (If you don't know who they are, look them up.)

He was asked to come up with some background music for a Western, and penned "Knockin on heaven's door". (Not bad...)

He is what he is, when it comes to what is recorded and played. You can like it, or not...but you do have to "get" Bob Dylan. There are arguments that he may be responsible for taking Rock and Roll and turning it into Rock music, giving birth to a movement. As a songwriter myself, I agree with the amazing Tom Waits when he called him "a planet to be explored... for a songwriter, Dylan is as essential as a hammer and nails and a saw are to a carpenter".

You can dislike his music, that's okay. Not everybody likes the way Dylan sounds. But just be careful that you don't confuse the music with the man. The person that won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for "profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power" might just make music that you just don't care for, and that's okay.

Sorry so wordy. I'm a big fan. 









 Not really. But I have found a way to slow some of it down.

Junk mail is so prevalent because of cost. Junk mailers pay a low rate for bulk mailings making it cost effective to send out tons of shit every week. Some junk mail contains return envelopes that allow you to respond to offers by returning the card or envelope to the company that mailed it.

**Junk mailers do not get a discounted rate on return mail**. They accept the increased cost as part of doing business with you.

Any time that I get a piece of mail that has one of those pre-paid envelopes or cards on them, I send it in. Sometimes I write a joke on them. Sometimes I just write **NO** really big. Doesn't matter, I send it off, sometimes empty. 

I have noticed over time that I get less offers of these types, so I have to assume that somewhere there is someone keeping track. 




 Google that shitty country song "Don't take the girl" if you don't know it. I think that is what you are talking about, but I don't know what that device is called. 




 It's hard for a man to admit that he likes to watch My Little Porny or some such. 




 First: why do you assume every girl hopes that her man doesn't watch porn? Pornography can and is a healthy part of a sexual relationship for many couples.

Second: A man who says he doesn't watch porn usually is embarrassed of the porn he watches. It's very rare to find a man that isn't into porn of some kind. They exist, but they're rare.

Third: Start watching porn that you like in front of him. Search out types of porn that you normally wouldn't watch, and engage him. Show him that you are totally okay with the most offbeat porn you can find and see what he responds to. (I don't care for 'regular porn'. I have a very sexually adventurous wife who loves getting freaky in all kinds of different ways, so most porn doesn't do it for me. I like to watch the weird shit; not because it turns me on, but because it's something that I don't see at home. (No honey, I don't want to watch you pee on an octopus, I just want to watch three Asian girls do that.)) 




 High-five her on the buttcheeks. 




 Ryan! 

Love the band!

Saw you guys multiple times at Floyd's Music Store in Tallahassee. (I even drunk-peed on the front tire of your bus one time, sorry about that!) So glad you guys have stuck it out together for so long, and still are putting out great music, and I love that you're doing what you're doing with Feed The Children. It's good to see folks using fame/money for good works.

So, question:

As artists with some modest success, are you and the gang doing the Feed The Children thing because you are finally able to (financially, time-wise, etc.) or because you feel like you owe the world a little something back for being graced with the ability to rock for a living?

 




 I have this problem at work as well. My servers seem to all have the idea that no matter what the customer says, they have to put it on the ticket. Makes me insane that I can't seem to change that behavior. 














 Nope. Love it. Do it all the time. Sometimes without reciprocation.  




 Quick! To the Reddit Science Cave! We need a study!

 




 Can't speak for other men specifically...

Me personally, it's not about the "facial" so much, as seeing myself cum. Having masturbated a lot before ever even coming close to having sex with a woman, I associate my orgasm with the view of myself cumming. My wife doesn't care for the facial at all, and I don't mind that, but every now and then I do like to "watch" myself cum, and we've worked out a compromise that works for us both. 
 

I have done the whole facial thing before however, and again without speaking for other men, I also felt a little bit of that shame/guilt feeling. How could it feel so good to do something like that to someone that I cared about? Strange. You and SO should talk. (That's always the answer...this sub could just be called r/gotalktothem) Maybe you could find some common ground that works for the both of you. 




 Why are we rewarding fuckers like this? This is one of many reasons why I killed my TV years ago...people like this getting fat stacks of cash for acting the way we all hope that our bosses don't ever act. Boycott this show. We've got enough trouble in the industry with all the cooking shows and the nonsense "reality chef" shows painting an untrue picture of what our day to day life is like. /rant 



















 I vote Tipp City as well. It just sounds right. Here's my two cents, sir, and congratulations on a job well done. (Working hard to get one in my city) 




 Do you use fryer boil-out in that place?

We have had great success in taking our boil-out *after use* and storing it in a big bin. Soak anything and everything in it for a day or two and *it will shine*. **SHINE**. Miracle stuff right there. 




 Glad to see someone repping Zach on this sub. The guy rocks. Amazing vocals, amazing musical talent. I think the only reason that he's not ultra famous is that he is one of the few acts that you truly have to see live to appreciate. 




 Dennis Miller was funny? When? 




 Really, just one more than I have now.

Every independent listener, (not a repeat offender) makes me happy. I don't have a large count out there, but that's not the reason that I do this. All this work, all this time, all this fun, is because I *have* to do it, I don't have a choice. Finding out that someone out there likes what I do, at least enough to listen, is an additional reward.

tl;dr I ain't greedy. Just listen to it. 

















































 I use "factual" and "fiction". 




 I would worry over that too much...but google some stuff, that Esmoke stuff might be as bad or worse for your folks as cigs. 




 Your momma's so fat, it takes her two trips to haul ass.
 




 I did a tribal Shark on Champion plastic that way. Worked well with two colors, (Black and blue) but it had some bleeding. I've cut on plastic as well, but it's such fine handwork that I wouldn't do it again. 




 That's the tough part. Simple designs you can eyeball. You could also used fixed point reckoning, or registration marks.

One way is to use uncut vinyl over part of the disc that won't be died. Cut a small "v" notch in the center of that piece. Before you stick the other stencils on your discs, center and cut matching "pointer" notches on each of your stencils. Use these fixed points to help line up each successive stencil.

I've heard of other dyers using laser pointers to line up the center of the disc, but the vinyl that I use for stencils is way too thick for that.

 




 Lots of help at the forums on [dgcoursereview.com](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=25), always check around there.

I don't know what you're specifically asking, but the basic short answer for multi level dyes is....multiple stencils.

A stencil for each color that you're doing, with just the single color that you're working on cut out on each one. 









 Yep. Both in culinary school, leaving class, she did the bend at the waist straight forward bit right in front of me. Don't really remember what I said, but I'm an ass man, so I can guess .... something like "don't bend over in front of me like that unless you mean it" kind of thing.

Couple weeks later, 4th of July party, drunken sexytimes, dating shortly after. Moved in, had two kids, moved cities, got married, well on our way to being old people together. 




 She stopped in front of me to pick up a pencil she had dropped, I made a comment about her ass. Together 13y, married 3y 





























 Florida is Chance.

You think it's a good thing, but then it's 10 bucks for coming in second in a beauty contest.
