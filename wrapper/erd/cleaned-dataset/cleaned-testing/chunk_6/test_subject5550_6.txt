 That's evidence of its origin. If Muhammad came to people with a pre-written book or stood and narrated the Qur'an in a long session, you can say somebody else may have written the book or he memorized what he was saying. He was an illiterate man, revealing verses on the spot to issues as they came up.. 




  You should reply to him, not me. He might've missed this post.

Thanks my bad. 




 You sure about that?

Yes - it was hyperbole though - to qualify - every substantial sect that originated within the first 500 years after Muhammad that's survived till today. I can't honestly speak to every niche group that pops up and attributes their beliefs to Islam.

And yes, that's all Taqiyyah is, or at least, that's all it is for the 12ers.

So the below is not taqiyyah? What exactly is this sort of permissible lying called?

 race traitors. 




 In the past 20 years in the USA, the number of pigs killed by Muslims is next to nothing compared to the number of pigs killed by non-Muslims....even in the last year... 




 We need to use those hadeeths. We don't go and say "My madhhaabs says so." If they have hadeeth to prove their methodology, then we accept it. If not, the act is haraam. I didn't say this... Allah and his messenger said this.

Without taking a position on the issue myself given my lack of qualification, I don't believe you're qualified to be having this argument. You're arguing against Sadl because "If they have hadeeth to prove their methodology, then we accept it" when you don't seem to realize the proof that Malikis/Awzais historically used for sadl was amal of the community.

Advice - Don't get lost in meaningless and fruitless discussions that you don't have the detailed and specific knowledge to take part in. 




 Those guys aren't necessarily Shi'ites. Malikis from certain regions also practice Sadl. 




 Shi'ites are allowed to pray behind Sunnis as long as they make their intentions and the prayer itself independently (per Khomaini, Sistani, and others). [Praying in unity is purely out of taqiyah](http://www.rafed.net/books/hadith/wasael-8/wasail13.html#299) and doesn't meet your fardh requirements (unless you make independent niyyat and simply make your movements together).

            

If this is in Iraq, he's probably actually praying a separate prayer behind the Sunni Imam. The only scholar I can think of that I believe allows Shi'ites to pray (and not have to recite) when behind a Sunni is Fadlallah and plenty of the other major scholars in Qom and in Iran consider him a deviant. 




 Also much of the Qur'an is directly addressed to Muhammad and deals with issues specific to the ummah at that time

That's evidence of its origin. If Muhammad came to people with a pre-written book or stood and narrated the Qur'an in a long session, you can say somebody else may have written the book or he memorized what he was saying. He was an illiterate man, revealing verses on the spot to issues as they came up. 




 Galatians indicates that Paul was on quite friendly terms with at least the apostles James and Peter.

You claimed that Christ's companions corroborated the claims of Paul the enemy - I'd really be surprised to see any statement independently by them recorded to that effect...this is what you said: "The church only accepted this former enemy because people who knew Jesus vouched for him." Evidence suggests that "the church" was a little less scientific in accepting canonicity and attribution...

And referencing a letter of Paul to prove the companions of Christ supported his assertions is circular reasoning...

God talks to me - my evidence of this is my statement that God talks to me. Paul says he's homies with James and Peter, therefore he must be good friends of James and Peter. It doesn't support your claim in any case that I've never heard from an academic at any rate.

That IS what free will implies, yes. Allah in the Qur'an also directly states that He will guard the scripture.

Not in Islam, there are countless passages saying God *does* a thing where human agents are the actual doers in Qur'an and ahadith. The same applies to your Old Testament. Are you suggesting that when God says he "does" something - like gives somebody a child - he comes down and intercedes against the course of human agency and free will in some way? If you are, your claim would contradict Biblical expressions of Godly attribution - not just Qur'anic ones...

The apostles were convinced...

They were convinced of something, sure. There's no real evidence that can be attributed to them directly to suggest they were convinced of your religion and not some other early Christian doctrine.

Ah, right. Those Nazarenes are quite similar to contemporary Messianic Jews in terms of what they affirm and practice, but there isn't much evidence of their existence as a firmly established sect with that label until the 4th century, **removing them quite a bit from Paul.**

We only have a direct use of their name in the fourth century - that doesn't place them well after Paul. The first mention of them by "the church" fathers suggest that this "heresy" originated well before then - Jerome and Epiphanius (4th century apologists of what would become your religion) explicitly place them well before the time of their writing. Back full circle to the point - your claim of some sort of mass acceptance of your Christianity by 'devout Jews' has no evidence - the evidence we do have of Jewish acceptance of Christ actually contradicts it, and Pauline Christianity appealed to non-learned non-Hebrews who had no understanding of Hebrew scripture, in many cases rejecting it point blank (like the major sect of early Christians who followed Marcion), while others ignored it implicitly (like Justin Martyr, an early father of "the church"). 




 The idea is if somebody's got a gun to your head, you don't do something stupid out of sense of misplaced pride, and a slightly excessive desire for martyrdom. 

Every Islamic sect allows that sort of lying. Are you suggesting that this is all the 12er concept of taqiyyah is? 




 Paul was considered "a ringleader of the Nazarene sect" by the Jews (see Acts 24) so I don't know what you mean by that bit. You are correct about the Ebionites.

You're thinking of the wrong Nazarenes. The early church apologies differentiate between whats referred in Acts 24 (a general outsider statement) and the actual Nazarene sect I'm referring to.

That doesn't really answer my request for evidence of Christ's disciples ever provably testifying on behalf of Paul the enemy of Christ.

Marcion is an interesting figure, ostensibly accepting many of Paul's writings yet fundamentally disagreeing with much of what Paul said.

Well, his version of Luke and the Pauline letters aren't identical to - say - the KJV so I'd wouldn't be surprised that he did disagree with some of the statements attributed to Paul.

The point of all that, if we step back, was that of the early Christian religions, Marcion's was one of the most substantial at the time (in terms of size) - and his religion (like that of many Pauline Christians) was very *not Jewish*. Something which flies in the face of your assertion about a myriad of devout Jews suddenly accepting Christ as Lord and Savior, Dead and Risen. By and large, the Christianity of the Jews that accepted Christ early on isn't much anything like your Christianity.

How could God ensure that agents of free will would protect the Qur'an if they are agents of free will? He may have foreseen that they would, but if they are agents of free will then He Himself did not bring it about.

Are you suggesting that unless there is some kind of miracle, an action done by a human being can never be attributed to the one that created the human being? 




  Compare this to Christianity, which spread like wildfire in the most inhospitable of circumstances....

But it didn't. You had a myriad of religions that attributed to themselves to Christ, and a variant won out. With Islam, one set of primary ideas has always been mainstream...

Is it reaching to say that the church made it the orthodox doctrine? Because that's exactly what happened. Paul only acquired credibility because what he wrote was NOT heresy to the early church. 

The fact that one version of Christianity that endorsed the writings attributed to Paul happened to win out historically isn't evidence that there was one monolithic entity ("the early church") that had the greatest market-share since inception...

The church only accepted this former enemy because people who knew Jesus vouched for him.

You'll understand that making claims about Jesus' companions giving veracity to this guy without evidence isn't very convincing. Paul's teachings were most popular amongst the very sort of people who didn't ever know Christ (a Hebrew). For instance, the Marcionites who rejected Christ's Jewish heritage and outright denied Hashem. Meanwhile the early Jewish churches (Ebionites, Nazarenes) seem to unanimously give no credibility to Pauline doctrine...

The question you're asking here is "why did God give us free will?" This is completely different from the question I was asking, which is "why didn't God protect the pre-Qur'anic revelations?" You turning my finishing statement around on me is a false equivalence because you're not asking the same question. You haven't answered mine either.

God didn't protect the Qur'an by sending down a magical barrier or writing it on stone tablets or Gold plates and then sending it down. The Qur'an was protected by human agency, people who had free will. It goes back to your original misunderstanding that God's promise that the Qur'an isn't corrupted requires him to come down and protect it by some divine miracle. God protects it by agents with free will - huffaz al Qur'an (memorizers of the Qur'an) and the early companions. So no false equivalence here, it gets to the heart of your hypothetical... 




 Also, it means lying in conditions which are life threatening, not to spread agendas.

Are you saying that taqiyyah in 12er tashayyu is exclusively for life-threatening situations and has nothing to do with anything else (like spreading agendas)? 




 Amd are any of their claims substantuated (I'm guessing no, especially the taqigya

Well taqiyah is a doctrine of the [Shi'ite sect](http://twelvershia.net/) and Obama's family came from a Sunni Muslim area - so I wouldn't lend it much credence. 




 http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Hadith/Ulum/israel.html

About the explicit statement by Muhammad on where israeliyyat are and are not acceptable.

The closest thing in the Qur'an off the top of my head would be where there is a verse that explicitly calls out the Jews for "worshipping" Uzair. 




 since it is apparently within the power of Allah to protect His revelation, why is the Qur'an the only revelation that was protected?

Because of the community that developed around Islam. The last guidance was sent at a time, place and to a people that were perfect for its preservation and spreading (their accomplishments are testimony to that). The Companions of the Prophet are considered the best generation of mankind in Islam. It was thru normal human agency that the Qur'an was divinely protected.

This was far and apart from the communities that developed around Christ or the other Prophets, yielding traitors like Judas and others, or vast chunks of Moses'/Aaron's closest companions start worshipping a calf, etc. It's also far and apart from Christian/Jewish scriptures that aren't provable to any of the relevant parties (immediate disciples of Christ or immediate contemporaries of Moses). And whereas with Muslims you have colophons establishing unanimity on the essential texts (Qur'an and several mutawattir ahadith), or at least allowing some means of non-textual verification - you don't have the same with the Bible. You have books ascribed to people who had no direct connection to Christ and who don't list their sources. In some cases, you have writings taken as canon written by the very enemies of Christ through his life - who supposedly saw him in visions after he left. And then you have other texts which have literally zero connection to Christ and are wholly 'prophecies' of later day Christian (Shepard of Hermas, Revelations, etc.)

How did a bunch of devout monotheistic Jews come to believe that Jesus is God and rose from the dead if Jesus preached the contrary and was spared from the cross?

But they didn't. Early Jewish acceptors of Christ (Ebionites, Nazarenes) didn't accept the modern standard we use to call somebody Christian or not-Christian. Did Pauline Christianity eventually win out and the other sects become marginalized to the point of non-existence - sure. But you're reaching if you're going to suggest that any substantial subset of devout/learned Jews accepted that particular variant.

The only way I can think of to reason around this is that He has some ulterior motive for sending people astray, perhaps to give them a test, but this does not make sense to me as the action of a Lord who wishes for all to believe the truth about Him.

I'm assuming you're a Christian, and therefore, Muhammad is a false prophet to you. Logically though, we can turn the table and say that God also created Muhammad with foreknowledge of Muhammad's false doctrine and his false teachings. The only way I can think of to reason around this is that He has some ulterior motive for sending people astray, perhaps to give them a test, but this does not make sense to me as the action of a Lord who wishes for all to believe the truth about Him.

Hypothetical why-not-this' aren't a good argument against claims of fact.

 Was hoping to come with something snarky. Clicked the link - and just awwww'ed. Damn it. 




 Holy God - it's like a curve ball from Baseball ---but with his feet! 




  FYI it is only the Protestants who have different versions of the Bible. The Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church use the same Bible and are 99.99% doctrinally compatible with each other and less different than Shia and Sunni Muslims in terms of actual different religious beliefs. If you base "corruption" on different versions of the Bible, then simply ignore Protestantism.

Well Catholics and Orthodox have different Bibles too (Catholics don't have 3 Maccabees for example) - (TheMoreYouKnow).

But his claim to corruption is based on the fact that even before Catholicism, there were substantial theological and textual variants. The Marcionites, people who had a Bible canon well before any of the elders of the Catholic church even thought of deciding on one, had their own version of the Gospel of Luke. They didn't recognize any of the other Gospels that became mainstream later on, and they didn't accept the OT. etc. And that's just one sect - there were tons of different groups each with their own text in the early Christian era. So his criticism of Biblical veracity goes a little deeper, and is a bit older than the modern sects of Trinitarian Christianity. 




 The differences with Sunni Islam and Shia Islam are nearly not as much as their similarities, noted that they share the same belief structure. The only thing is political shareholders within the caliphate.

In premise, sure. But in reality, for the majority of Shi'ites (Ithna Ashariyya) No - it's not. Imami Shi'ites invented their own religious tradition - that contradicts every other legitimate sect. The fundamental concept behind understanding their/your religious texts is that the Imams would say one thing to the general public, and one secret message just to the select few. So in Sunni books, in non-12er Shi'i books, etc. Imam Jafar as-Sadiq will say one thing. But in Shi'ite books, that same issue will have two narrations. One that agrees with everybody else (in the region of the narrator) and another version that's supposed to be the "truth". I'd be happy to bring you a simple example even.

As far as disavowing Shi'ites as Muslims, only a few people go that far. For the most part, Sunni scholars give Shi'ite laymen the benefit of the doubt. I can link you to people who are extremely critical of your religion and don't consider it Islam, but if you ask them about the status of the average kid in Iran, they won't drop takfir willy nilly on laypeople. 




 If God is willing to send someone new to redirect his direction

Where is the redirect? At no point in canonical Jewish scripture or Christian scripture does God say "xyz is the course humanity will take indefinitely and this is my Final word on the matter and so-and-so is my last recipient of guidance". Islam explicitly states "this is it". So it's still compatible with previous prophets, whereas if Bahais except Islam was revealed by God - it is by definition incompatible by its own primary texts. You're comparing two completely incomparable situations. 




  Well he did wait about 600 years before he sent Mohammed. He could have avoided all of this by telling the people of the time everything he told Mohammed. God could have made sure the Gospel was going to never change. But he put it in a time and place for a reason.

And he could've just not let Adam and Eve eat the fruit and just do away with this nonsense by not putting that temptation out there. If you're going to argue about what somebody believes happened, based on "what ifs" and "why not this?" - you're not going to have a fulfilling discussion that goes anywhere. Your premise is intrinsically flawed because you're suggesting that there are simpler ways of having gone about things - but using that rationale, we can work our way back well before the Bahai religion was even invented.

Not to mention that though your solution to a single historical incident may appear simpler to you than what humanity experienced in reality - it doesn't make it 'truer'. It's a meaningless hypothetical.. 




 Yes. Joining a terrorist or criminal outfit doesn't make you any less human than joining an organization that tortures and experiments on people (the SS, the CIA, etc.)

 On the same exact page...you have reports explicitly stating that Muhammad wore his hair down to his shoulders...long hair for Wa'il would obviously mean something meaningfully and abnormally longer than that... 




 By whom exactly?

In Sunni texts. You're using a Shi'ite source, quite literally the narration you're referring to is from Wasael as shi'a... 




 Not inciting religious hatred (there's plenty of gurdwaras, mosques and temples that do so on the regular). He's being charged with "Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code, relating to "waging war against any Asiatic Power in alliance with the Government of India"." 




  Bring any who plan or act on atrocities before fair courts to be tried in the worlds eyes, randomly killing people as revenge can only make things worse.

Don't worry - they will. Pakistan just repealed the ban on the death penalty. Expect plenty of summary executions and kangaroo courts in the near future - all for the greater good of course. 




 Keep going Pakistan! I was happy to leave the sand box when my tour was finished, but what those monsters did to those innocent children is just sick. I would do anything to go back and shove my m27 IAR up some Taliban ass.

The Taliban you were fighting and TPP (also TPA) are completely different entities, with their own structures and their own leadership. The Afghan (original) Taliban actually condemned the attack...

But of course, if we're mad at a group of people, they're just a monolithic caricature. 




 No. He didn't. Said "statement" didn't come out till much later - hardly "within hours". During those several days, the Taliban actually demanded evidence in order to turn him over. So we bombed them.

You want to shut down a conspiracy theorist, understandable. But at least get your facts straight... 




 Don't be silly. You can't attach laser beams to them. They're just ill-tempered scorpions flying out of explosions (which they'll survive unlike everything else in blast radius).

 "We may have tortured you a bit, but look on the bright side, we could've killed you" 









 Yep - editorialized title. Should read: 22 killed in air strikes. Actual facts from "article":

LANDI KOTAL: At least **22 suspected militants** were killed in air strikes on their positions in Tirah valley of Khyber Agency on Tuesday.

So basically, 22 people are dead. They are supposed to have been militants. Whatever the case, the Pakistani army will be seeing red for the next couple months. 




 The rational strategy is to make your enemies fear for not just their lives, but the lives of their wives and children if they help the US and/or don't help the Taliban. It's a means of breaking the enemy's will to fight.

It wasn't 'rational' at all. People will fear for their lives, but now there will be national consensus for more govt. operations. At the same time, because of this incident, the total government shutdown scheduled by PTI (for the 18th of this month) and PAT (for the 17th) were both cancelled. It is literally the most irrational thing they could do - both in terms of what was done and timing. 




 Thousands. The Pakistani government allowed US drone strikes that killed over 1,000 people in total (though the US only targeted 80 or so individuals). We can get away with killing children because male child in the blast radius over 16 (or 14?) is considered an "enemy combatant" in official tolls. Meanwhile, the devastation by the recent Pakistani army offensives blows the US-drone strike toll out of the water.

Not that what TPP is doing is justified, but there is context here for sure. 




 The most powerful quote by the alleged TPP commander, "What about our kids and children[?]" 




 thank you. 




 Unless you run an increasing militarized police force. 




 It isn't just about deaths - it's the strange deaths, suicides and unsolved murders that are (as you imply anecdotal) reaching mainstream media that is causing worry. 




 I don't know that violence is definitely going up, but we're far more connected to the world and local pockets in our own borders than in the past - so it will seem that way to us.

Federalization of the police. At least in the US. We'll continue to hear stories about bad cops, and the gang-culture of police agencies. The public will support government moves for more 'over-sight' by the bureaucracies that have demonstrated such commendable management skills to date. They will snub out secessionist ideas, with continued crackdowns against locals who are becoming less nationalistic, and more local and globalist/humanist at the same time. You'll hear more about the "homegrown" ideologically driven threats (vs just the Muslim/Russian bogey men). At the same time Obama talks about body-cams, the DOJ continues to [auction off and gift](http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2014/12/16/US-Army-Will-Start-Selling-Surplus-Humvees-to-the-Public-Starting-Tomorrow-7724296/) 'excess' military supplies to local agencies.

Meanwhile, the Islamic bogey man has become realer than ever in the past. No more exotic names - the newest 'threat' is quite literally "the Islamic state". Their stated ambitions have encouraged lone gunmen scenarios by wackos in different countries, completely unaffiliated with the group, to attack their local government and civilian populations. Hilary will become president while Republicans hold heavy elsewhere - resulting in one of those great divided presidencies that gives leadership an excuse to be ineffectual on all issues except corporate interests and the military industrial complex. Increase international role by Western governments in the Middle East will result in reprisals at our door-steps, and we'll continue to tell ourselves they hate us for our freedom and enjoin in the fundamentally flawed circle of violence.

The US/NATO rift with Russia will continue to increase and become problematic with more proxy wars and attacks on allies of these nations by independent parties. China, inexorably tied to the US by trade and debt-purchasing will be assessing their next move. Iran and it's proxies will be continue to increase in conflict with 'Sunni' powers while Israel will continue on a far-right trend.

All in all, use condoms when you're having sex, light up joint and try to enjoy the good things in life. There are less cynical theories about the future as well - still light up a joint and enjoy the good things. 




 Worse - it's an image of click-bait with no real punchline. 




 The goal is to make participation in the military more "costly" for Pakistanis who might otherwise consider joining, along with those already in uniform. 

Pakistani military isn't the sort of volunteer military you have in the US. You generally need family connections to get into the military - and then your next generation takes your place (if they don't move abroad). In other countries, like Iraq, attacking military bases says 'don't sign up'. But in Pakistan, the people who are in, are in.

It remains to be seen what the effect will be in Pakistan.

It's a blessing for the current leadership. Pakistan has been seeing a lot of protests lately about ineffectual government and a younger generation wants new blood (Imran Khan). Nothing like a tragedy to stir emotion and bring diverse stake-holders to the same team. 




 No - it's a desperate attack by a group of people who've been seeing the Pakistani government do the same to their loved ones and families. I'm not justifying the barbarity, but it's not taking place in a vacuum. If the Pakistani government had adopted less of an American-themed "disagree with us and we'll bomb you back to the stone age", and actually brought stake-holders to the table, Pakistan wouldn't be so crime/terror ridden as it is under present leadership.

That's if we assume PT are responsible - according to Shah Farman, theres no proof of that yet. 




 If we last for generations to come, secessionist movements don't pick up steam and somebody else doesn't take the world super power slot. 




 Yea but then he would've won and inherited Bush and Bush-era Congress/Senate's epic fuck-ups across the board. Instead, he was basically guaranteed to lose and you got your first black president - who disillusioned his base to an incredible level.

 With some customers even when you try to explain all the new electronic ways to bank, they just pretend it doesn't exist afterwards. 

As one of those annoying customers, let me explain our logic as well. I can speak for basically anybody who isn't over 80 that still goes into the branch for these personal banking tasks.

- Debit cards are *one more* card to keep in the wallet. Too many cards, trim the fat and the debit card has got to go. A lot of people use CC for just about everything and don't typically need to pull money. When we do, its easier to go to a branch located in a nice retail space you were going to be in anyways - and walk up to the teller with your drivers license (a card you generally need to keep in your wallet) to pull the cash. Most tellers in my experience fill out all the necessary information on the slip for me as well - an added bonus. I literally stand there and engage in the small talk they're trained to make with me.

- When you use an ATM, you can't easily rob the bank. Every now and then, many people get these temptations to rob the bank. Breaking into an ATM is not easy (source: Breaking Bad s02e06). Slipping a note to the teller that you've got a gun is very simple (hint: you don't actually need to have a fun). I've personally never robbed a bank. But we like knowing we've got the option when we're going by to withdraw money anyways.

- There are no lollipops/coffee at the ATM machines outside of the branch. You need to physically be in the branch to appease yourself of these amenities. At that point, you might as well just get to the teller if the line isn't looking like the DMV.

 To clarify your fatwa question - A fatwa is an opinion on a religious issue by a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence. OBL wasn't a scholar in the religion so his statements aren't fatwas, but moreover, these aren't religious edicts, just statements of objectives attributed to him.

OBL raised [some interesting points](http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html), even though the methods of these groups were heinous and diabolical. It's a shame that we just keep regurgitating the same nonsense about how they hate us for our freedoms and bikinis - rather than reassessing our international role.

"I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to Bush's claim that we hate freedom.

If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.

No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. So shall we lay waste to yours. "

"I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred. " 




 This. When it comes to corporate corruption and unwavering support for the military-industrial complex, we're as bi-partisan as can be. This is definitely not a red v blue thing. Republicans are your loud, threatening rapists while Democrats wait till you're properly sedated before slipping their hard-ons into our unprotected collective anus. 




  1) Restraint goes out the window when facing foes who don't show any either. Al Qaeda and the Taliban purposely attack civilians. They torture and kill hostages and POWs. This causes a race to the bottom.

 That assumes that the nature of time is exactly as we perceive it. Your light bulb analogy assumes...

Right - you asked 'Why does *casual dependence*...' A moment in time and its discrete precedents are related by casual dependence (a function of time). Only thing I'm assuming is that time is what we know it to be, and not something we don't know it to be.

that the present is somehow a privileged position within it.

Not the present, any discrete moment in time has the same issue with respect to casual dependence and the idea of there not being a beginning. I said, 'select a[ny] discrete moment'. You can select a moment 5 million years ago.

For a different analogy, consider an infinite wire, a light bulb, **a power source**, and flowing current. As long as the wire is superconducting, there's nothing problematic with this situation in my mind.

Where is the power source? The beginning of time? Because that's precisely what I was pointing out (time has a beginning). If your wire is infinitely long away from the light bulb, no matter what distinct point you select on the wire, you are no closer to the power source - so there's no basis for supposing a flowing current up to the selected point. 




 Select a discrete 'moment'/snapshot F in the physical universe (in our case - the present). In order for that moment F to have occurred, the moment before it must have occurred (casual dependence). But in order for that moment before F to have occurred, the moment before it too must have occurred. And so on tending towards infinite in the reverse. You never arrive at F because you infinitely keep requiring a dependence for each dependence you select. Temporal infinite in the reverse isn't a logical proposition in the only universe we know.

By analogy, suppose a dim lightbulb is connected to an infinitely long wire. In order for it to be lit up, current must reach a discrete point on the wire closest to the bulb. In order to reach any discrete point on the wire, it must have reached the precedent discrete point on the wire. So the lightbulb can never actually light up since for every point to which current should have reached, it requires it to have reached the point before it - to infinite. 




 Different authorities gave different answers as to the 'why' - but the majority Orthodox opinion seems to be against directly using electricity on shabbat itself. So electric cars would fall under many of the same issues. Even when they come out with self-driving cars running on automated schedules (so operator doesn't need to interact with it) - I'm sure some people will object. 




 You make it sound like you don't actually think there is widespread evidence of ISIS torturing captives. It's all over the place--**they don't particularly try to hide it.**

These are based on apparent witness testimonies from Kurds/Shi'ites and other opposing [stake-holders](http://www.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/2nnviw/two_arabs_try_to_rape_kurdish_mother_in_kirkuk/). That's not what I asked for. Let's try again - if **they don't particularly try to hide it** (assuming its occurring), you should be able to help me here: "Can you link me to one single video of that than? These guys don't shy away from the camera..." 




 His loved ones. His 'family' and friends received death threats for the duration of the witch hunt, constant media attention, had to take down their facebooks. And of course they didn't catch a break when the kid turned up dead.

I guess it didn't really ruin their lives but I can imagine they won't look back on that series of events nostalgically. 




  I would love to see a rebuttal of this by moderate Muslims.

Then ask it in /r/Islam. They'll expect you to provide a proper source though, so find the 'Arabic original of the purported Daesh tract and go on over there. 




  Also, there is something pathetic about a guy who supports a war and even helps convince others to go off to kill and die for the cause while he sits at home tweeting about it. 

Kinda like your average military recruiter in any country with a contingency abroad 




 Islam actually has explicit restrictions associated with going out for fighting in certain cases while your mother is still alive 




 They believe he was raised into heaven...

That's complete bull.... Show me one single hadith from the Imams saying he was raised into Heaven...he was reportedly on Earth for over a hundred years during ghaybat as saghirah and you don't have any textual support for him floating into space as part of his ghaybat al kubra. 




 Can you link me to one single video of that than? These guys don't shy away from the camera when cutting people's throats, mass executions and even driving around with corpses behind their motorcycles. Or at least some reputable source suggesting that they do. If there's volumes of evidence, it should be a pretty quick find. Let me know. 




 He couldn't play on his ipod. 




 We'll see if its actually him or somebody else's life ruined by social media witch-hunts (like the Boston Marathon Reddit witch hunt) 




 Unmasked: the man behind top Islamic State Twitter account

Channel 4 News has chosen not to reveal his full name 




 He must be. The problem with driving on shabbat isn't just the analogy to riding an animal - but the fact that you're igniting fuel to drive. The prohibition on burning fuel is independent of whether you do it using your clothing or mode of transport. 




 We have sinkholes too - ours are just younger. 




 Notice how this same issue is being framed in the other subs. Fuckin Disgusting. 




 Holy fuck. Stay safe bitch 




 and ISIS tortures

Is there any evidence for this or do we just assume that anything evil we do, they must also engage in? 




 drone strikes that kill without a trial and has unknown collateral damage - good

Collateral damage is known. We've targeted about 88 individuals. Over 1,000 people have died in drone strikes. 




 False equivalency

Agreed. There is no documented evidence to support that ISIS tortures their captives. 




 UNDERCOVER COPS in march just exposed - they were instigators of looting. Pulled gun on protestors when discovered. #berkeleyprotests

 This gives an even different context:

https://storify.com/CourtneyPFB/undercover-cops-outed-and-pull-gun-on-crowd 




 Which, as far as anybody knows, only applies to our current universe. How do you know that anything of the sort applies "before" our universe?

I didn't say anything about 'before our universe' (i.e. before space/time). I'm saying an infinite regress doesn't make sense *in the context of our universe* as an argument of time - given causality. I'm talking to *empirical causality* - so the causality we know. 




 Do I understand you correctly that you're OK with infinity up, down, left, right, front, back, and future-wise...

Unless you have a reasonable basis to suggest those aren't possibilities, I'm going to assume they're possibilities.

What makes that one direction different?

Causality. Each discrete 'moment' of time, from the present moment we experience, is causally dependent on its precedent moment. If there is no 'origin' for time in our universe, the present moment could never have been arrived at. 




 How do you know our current moment couldn't be reached?

Empirical causality.

How do you know that existence isn't cyclical? Our universe could constantly "refresh" with the death of this one being the cause or beginning of the next one.

Sure - existence could be apparently cyclical. The universe can 'die' and then 'restart'. But if those events take place in time, you still don't escape causality. And if you don't escape causality as a function of time in the material world, then you still can't have an infinite regression. 




  Regardless of how things got to right now, "this present moment" does indeed exist. The fact that perhaps you can't fathom that there may be an infinite amount of something before it doesn't mean it's not possible, only that you aren't capable of thinking about it. 

It's an ancient argument that's been stated in different ways on different topics dealing with the physical world. It's not a matter of being incapable of thinking about an infinite regress - It's simply the fact that it doesn't make sense to even posit that as an option.

I've seen people try to reference this sort of argument more than a few times in the last year or so, and I simply do not understand it. Can you try to elaborate on this point more

We can step through it. We agree that "this present moment does indeed exist" - do we agree that the moment immediately precedent to "this present moment" also did "indeed exist"? And that "this present moment" is casually related to the precedent (i.e. this moment exists because the moment before it existed)? 




 Do you see a similar problem with an infinite spatial extent that you do with an infinite temporal extent

Not a problem with an infinite temporal extent. Time can *tend towards* infinite (we can't know if it will, but it's logically plausible). Infinite 'space' also isn't inherently problematic. But you can't have 'turtles all the way down' - not in the physical universe. 




 People *in* Ferguson were burning down some shops and what-not - sure. I'm not excusing idiocy. The people protesting during the day, and the journalists covering them were not being "beat down" by the cops? I've got plenty of cases I posted submitted links about over the last few months... 




 I don't have sources - I remember reading about it in a history of Muslim conquest of India. The argument had something to do with how the Hindus had the Upanishads and some of the mashaykh and rulers accepted not only taking jizya on them but conferring rights of ahlul kitab on them as well. Do you read Urdu - I can see if I can find something more specific lying around? 




 There's plenty of different subsects of 'Buddhism' - different groups have believed different thinks afaik. 




 And you show a very poor understanding of a very simple concept . The question isn't whether infinite can exist on paper, in theory or if it can exist in positive time/space - all of which are obviously plausible. The question is if an infinite regress can exist *in the physical world* as an argument of time. In *the physical world* where each discrete moment (however subdivided) is dependent on the preceding moment, you can't have an infinite chain of dependencies and still arrive at a particular point (e.g. this moment). We're not talking about conceptualizing a number line - we're talking about whether or not there can be an infinite regress of **causes** 




 The original Kalam argument had the "everything has a cause" phrasing, only the revamped version by Craig has the new wording.

Are you saying that Craig interpolated the wording to the arguments? If so - that's patently false - it was always effectively the same as "every effect/accident (or "everything that comes into existence") has a cause". The wording isn't needed to accommodate a cause for the first accident that is itself not an accident, since that isn't what was ever posited... 




 1) How do they know it can't be an infinite regress?

How would the present exist if there were an infinite regress and no beginning? This present moment could never have been reached..

You can simplify it to something linear, imagine a casual chain where each event on a line depends on the preceding event. And the events preceding exist infinitely. You can never reach the final/current event because each dependency has its own dependency, ad infinitum. 




 Do you have a source for the version of the du'a you're referring to (from which of your hadith books it was derived)? Short answer: no. Long answer: Different parts of that du'a (as they usually originally exist in different pieces and become combined later on) may be plenty of Sunni texts but I'd need sources and original text to find out. 




 I believe it doesn't violate the Islamic principle of shirk, does it?

IMO it would. Shirk is any association w/ God. Saying anything about God outside of what is empirical or supported by texts would be shirk. An avatar afaik would be God taking on a human form (like the whole xtian - Jesus isn't God but is part of the Godhead - hence an avatar).

Also how are the Vedas seen in Islam? And during the time of Mohammad?

The Vedas, Gita, puranas etc. are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. There also doesn't seem to be explicit mention at the time of Muhammad. I vaguely recall a hadith (not confirmed on the authenticity) that encouraged conquest in India. It's impossible that some people weren't at least nominally familiar with it though given that Islam spread as far as China within Muhammad's lifespan (as he'd sent companions there).

At some point in time, Muslim scholars were open to considering certain Hindus as people of the book by classifying them as Sabeans or simply as a separate group. Scholarship in the region, at the time, became inclined to believe that Hindu scripture originally had the hallmarks of Monotheism but was corrupted over time (like with the canonization of the Gospels or the preservation issues with the Torah). 




 Muhammad was asked about how before Islam, he used to participate in gatherings of the notables of his tribe to assess the situation for the community and provide help to its most destitute. When he was asked about it after Islam, whether he would still attend something like that (i.e. engage in something like that with non-Muslims), he reportedly said yes. Doesn't really answer your question - but sets the stage for why Muslims tend to be focused beyond just local issues.

It's not the same exact struggle, but do people feel companionship when they're wronged in similar ways? Yea. Same way Irish revolutionaries traditionally had a sort of common understanding with Palestine. The same cops beating down in Ferguson and elsewhere in the US go to Israel for training. They use weapons designed and [tested on Palestinians](http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/1639) (google Eram Efrati for more info). It's the same struggle - down to the weapons used. 




  I wouldn't be surprised if you got shot.

Except that this is the version of events according to the cop - while several witnesses saw a man with his hands ultimately in the air being executed. Regardless of whether the cops version of the beginning of the events is accurate. And if you've dealt with cops anywhere in this country - especially in law, you'll notice that it isn't as a big deal to fudge reports, or even commit outright purgery. Examples abide in r/bad_cop_no_donut and r/law. 




 Personally - I wouldn't recommend books. Walk into a mosque if you got one near you. 




 The problem with what you're looking for is that you'll likely be really inquisitive, and any person only has so much time. There are hundreds of people reaching out to any reputable scholar, and he'd be setting aside a disproportionate time just to address your questions. I have a feeling you'll be thoroughly disappointed. 




 They've been running paid whitelists for a while now and weren't telling people. It's more in the open now and they have a business model associated with extorting the companies that run the ads. I could care less about their business model - what bothered me is the deceptive nature of initially not even disclosing the reason behind specific whitelisted domains, etc.  




 Yea, there's some pretty obvious interpretative interpolations in brackets, but w/out a direct link to source, I wouldn't trust Memri for shit beyond a gist. 




 Like, what am I even supposed to say now?

You're supposed to ask for the raw Arabic material, verify its them, and then justifiably become infuriated. 




 This. They can have Shitcast send you a letter. They won't win their case. 




 That's an interesting assessment. 




 Are you tryna say /u/Igotdagold is a narc? 




 You're an accidentally great person. God bless you sir. 




 Can confirm. They are the second link in spite of supposedly being a really good torrenting site and not just SEO content spam and shitty ads. So I've heard - I've never actually used the site....What are torrents? 




 Thank you ad block!

You mean thank you AdBlock Edge and a giant middle finger to AdBlock Plus. 




 And porn ads make more money than no more ads. That way of looking at it is still relevant. 




 No - I think I'm not being clear. What ISIS has released pushes even Islamists away from them. Remember the Taliban? They also put out videos, just like ISIS (not as great production value back then though). Hated by the world, recognized as the legitimate govt of Afghanistan by two countries though. Had quite a popular following and the unpopular decisions they made (like blowing up the Buddha statue) were the sort of things that the international community didn't like but your super devout Muslim could get behind.  And they were with it to the very end - opium production eliminated - crime rates down - people living and moving about in most parts controlled by them with security - even when the world super-power came knocking, they refused to accept foreign intervention and only would agree to handing the accused party over if evidence was served. They had, and have, a large fan base in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Other Islamist groups? Pakistani Taliban. When Benazir Bhutto was shot and killed, these guys denied it (and legitimately had no role it). When Malala was shot, these guys apologized. They denied accusations and apologized for mistakes - they didn't ignore the former and boast about the later. UIC (before al-Shabbab), somebody opened fire on a movie theatre from amongst their extremists. They were tried and executed. The Islamist group punished its own under the same law applied to everyone else.

Why did Muslims in these regions support groups like Taliban, Hamas, or UIC? Because these groups represented *law* in areas where all that's needed is for a dictator to ask for your head. They represented unbiased establishment of this law, and they believed several of the laws were divinely inspired. They believed - and do believe - that what they're doing is for the good of their society Muslim and otherwise, regardless of what you and I think. I can comprehend that "islamist who wants to live by the quran and hadith without compromise" perspective.

What are the ISIS videos? Let's kill a journalist with no court proceedings and evidence that our action was justifiable. Let's do the same thing with another chap. Let's do it again. Let's get an entire city of average citizens to beat some captured soldiers to death. Then ride their corpses on our motorcycles through the streets. Lets put out tracts that openly allow for slavery in spite of modern connotations. Let's do it without any apologetic material. Let's execute prisoners en-mass, with no depicted attempt at justification. Let's basically give countries an overt excuse to throw a wrench in the stated objective. Let's endanger the lives of the muhajireen (immigrants) who came to Syria during the course of the revolution.

So basically, there's a big difference between what ISIS leadership is self-representing and what those other groups self-represented. They're not currying favor with secular Arabs or devout Sunnis, they've alienated everyone including many of the more crazy devout sort. They are quite literally their own worst enemy (assuming their stated objective is truly their objective). 




 No, the interpretation is on point (assuming that this is a real ISIS document). "That their right hands possess" means slaves - it's historically always meant slaves. Islam never outright prohibited slavery, it merely discouraged it. 




 'counter productive to their jihad.'

Literally every single piece of media they've produced has been counter productive to their stated cause. Every last one.
