 I belive it's called the [Mozambique Drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Drill) 




 Finally, it feels that Far Cry 2 is often largely forgotten and overshadowed by it's sequels. However I still feel that FC2 was the more compelling game for me, despite its very obvious flaws and shortcomings. 

Here's a few things I really liked about FC2: 

1. **Weapon Loadouts** were a lot more realistic, you had to really prepare before a mission otherwise chances are that you will most likely die. 

2. **The Buddy System** The idea of having buddies that would help you out in combat and can potentially die was both rewarding and harrowing at the same time, even though these characters aren't fleshed out, you do feel a sense of comradare with them as they are the only characters trying to survive in the harsh African climate alongside yourself, the player. 

3. **The Fire System** It felt like the fire system in FC2 spread a lot more and engulfed everything in it's path. Compare this to FC3 and 4 and it makes them look like tiny shrubs on fire. I'm not exactly sure why Ubisoft went backwards in this regard. 

4. **Weapon Jamming**, ok this one is a double edged sword. It was pretty tense to be in a fire fight and having your gun suddenly jam, however this happened way too often. While there was a system to tell how degraded a gun was by its looks it still jammed too many times, even for guns that looked of good quality. The main issue with this is you pick up poorly maintained guns off enemies who never seem to have their guns jam on them. This was more a case of interesting design idea but flawed execution. 

5. **Time and Day** Finally, the time and day. I really loved doing missions where you had to take out certain people. It would start off with a long drive to the safe house from where you would unload your weapon cases and take what you had carefully prepared, then you take a nap and set the time progression for you to start the mission. It was really nice being able to control the time and day like that and you felt like a proper bad ass doing the set up for these missions. 

 




 What other open world games do you think do long distance detail really well? Witcher 3 may be a candidate for that in the future... 




 So Motorstorm with Driveclubs weather system and first person view point would be heaven. 




 Yep the good job line is actually perfectly delivered imo.  




 Also if that pilot has a family they are probably going to be fucked for generations to come.  




 Hey guys what graphical improvements/engine improvements would you like to see in Elder Scrolls VI. I'm assuming that ES:VI will use whatever engine that Fallout 4 will use, so I guess this question can be meant for both games. Personally I would just like to see a much less rigid movement system, the movement in Skyrim just felt super rigid, especially when you jump! Obviously graphical improvements will be seen, my dream would be to see nice volumetric clouds like you see in Driveclub, [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4l39926dJ4), now I understand that it's obviously a racing game so that tech being used in an open world would be very taxing, but I think it would be nice to explore the possibility :D 




 Personally the best way to do it, assuming the Broccolis sign off on it, is to get approach it take elements from the best stealth/action games out there at the moment and add their own Bond flare to them. E.g you could borrow the dialogue system from Alpha Protocol, the combat system from Arkham perhaps with an animation set which is more suited to Bond's fighting style. This is assuming Rocksteady are actually the developers behind this game as they seem to do a good job of resurrecting video game franchises that are dead in the water.  




 "Farking idiot" 




 I really would like to see a Neuromancer film. It just seems a bit too difficult to adapt into a film though. The only thing related to the film production is this [poster](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qiG1icHA--/184i8h6ghlbc5jpg.jpg) 




 Oh ok Flaming Dragon...fuck face 




 I don't think Nolan really does commentaries. At least not in the last films released, here's hoping Interstellar is his first. 




 The film Oblivion did another cool alternative to using green screen [Here's the video on how they projected the environment onto the set to naturally light it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DCkIuv82Q4)  














 Fucking hell, that was amazing. 




 I feel that Insurgent (Divergent 2) looks pretty abysmal. The first one was already a lacklustre film cashing in on that hunger games crowd. Now they are splitting the last film into two parts as well... 




 Which story?? 




 I feel the problem with the Hobbit comparison is that you can clearly tell that the majority of the cg budget went to Smaug. Don't get me wrong Smaug looks amazing but the look of the film is very inconsistent with some parts looking amazing while others looking average.  




 Well to be fair that's actually not a brand new Audi it's actually an 05-06 model. 




 I really liked this film. This particular film shows how much better the flow of a car chase can be when the actor is doing all his own stunts. 




 April here in Australia.  




 Yeah true that his experience on Alien 3 is probably what drove him away from big budget studio films. 




 So a studio is willing to put in $200 million to produce a Bioshock film, who do you get to direct and write etc? Would it be set in the 2007 game or Infinite's universe? Who would you cast as the main characters etc. Just a little discussion to spark our creativity! 




 Fincher would be interesting, I don't think he has really touched fantasy/sci-fi since Alien 3, unless i'm missing an obvious film he did recently. He would be a very interesting choice as he has a lot more weight with his name now and his last film, Gone Girl did very well at box office. 

 




 As a green p plater soon to go on my fulls, as scary as it sounds you tend to pick up so much more skill while driving alone. At least I did since my parents were not so great at driving haha. 




 How much did this cost? 




 Funnily enough I saw the first two films in HFR and the last one in regular 24FPS and I think I would have preferred to see this one in 48 since there's a lot more action happening in the film. I did notice some specific parts where the scene appeared to be jittery, especially during the long panning shots of landscapes. In your comment regarding the actors looking superimposed, I felt that they still looked superimposed in 24, I think this to do with the overly digital look of the film which is just a big step backwards when compared to the LOTR trilogy. Personally though I think Battle of Five Armies serves to be the one that benefits from the 48 fps since there's not much downtime during the film.  




 Supposedly James Cameron is planning to shoot all 3 Avatar sequels in 60FPS. 




 My name is hefe 




 Here in Australia it was called The Wrong Man, I feel Lucky Number Slevin is much better, The Wrong Man sounds like some shitty rom-com.  




 People may disagree with me but I am gonna say Michael Mann, I love me a good crime based film and with that distinct look he films with.  




 So basically once Ari created his new agency with Babs what is the estimate of his salary? I am assuming it was a few mil right? 




 "Having the knowledge of from the Golden age of Knowledge and being able to bring that to the Golden Age of Tech Phase II, it makes it a whole new level". 

This sounds he is talking about some RTS of some kind.  




 The one on the left actually looks awesome. Tobacco era really brought out some interesting and great liveries.  




 At least it wasn't as bad as the [DBZ Kinect trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umM0jivA4cw), nothing is that bad... 




 Do you guys think if BMW ever come back to F1 in the near future that they would link up with Williams again or would they become their own team kind of like Mercedes AMG? Was there bad blood between Williams and BMW after the split? 




 I don't think the average smart phone user is going to have a bluetooth controller though. The real question is whether it will work well enough with touch controls without the need for a controller. 




 There's actually an option to recap the story on the dragon age keep website. In that you get to create a character and make story decisions that carry over into DA:I, like the Mass Effect 2 comic. It's actually pretty great since you just export that character into the game.  




 I actually have a 2012 118i and on my registration it is classified as a wagon for some reason. 




 Damn lol thanks anyway.  




 So uhh you gonna tell us where you bought that? 









 That guy 9 seconds in nodding. "Yeah he's definitely possessed." 




 The game is completely functional now imo and is definitely worth buying. I got it and launch and still enjoyed it and now that they have added weather it is now a different beast entirely (in a good way).  




 I'm sure there's a Studio Ghbili film around here that can fit into this theme. 




 The first one Knights of the Old Republic, it's available on Steam. 




 Personally I think the character is fine the way he is since the clone wars expanded upon Boba in a sufficient enough manner that would lead him into becoming a big bounty hunter. The studio would never let him have his face covered for the whole film, so that idea is out of the question. Also it would severely limit the actors ability to portray his full range of performances.  




 This, I really can't stand that woman.  




 I fucking love when this happens followed by the inevitable "player x has left the game". 




 BB-8 aka Ball Bot 8 




 u wot m8 




 Also [Elysium](http://whysoblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/elysium-whysoblu-7.jpg) 




 and James Cameron.  




 How does the older iDrive system hold up today? 




 For me it was Bilbo in Fellowship where he tries to grab the ring from Frodo.  




 Sorry I meant Matthew fox (guy from lost) 




 I was wondering if the studio will ever release the alternate ending for WWZ since I heard that it was pretty much finished. It would seem like a more complete film since it was fairly obvious in the theatrical cut that many characters that pop up during the film were clearly meant to have a bigger role (e.g Michael Fox's character). Will this ending ever see the light of day or has the studio just buried it? 




 [One of the best scenes in the game in my opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6RHg-BCk0g) 




 So I was in Year 8 when I went to see this film, not realising it would be 3 hours long. I enjoyed it but it never really stuck with me. I'm curious if you guys felt the same way in that everything felt way too drawn out and could have used a good trim in the editing room. Also do you feel the CG still holds up to this day since that was a very specific focus of the film? 




 I walked into the showroom at Castle Hill once and saw the prices for these beds, basically you are paying about 15-30k...for a bed. 




 I would say most of the cgi in Star Wars Episode 1 still hold up, especially the pod race scene.  




 Nexus 5 Android 5.0 on Telstra.  




 [You](http://s.mlkshk-cdn.com/r/2KNX) 




 New Zealand but not Australia, wot.
 




 Not to mention he has been releasing a film every year. Prometheus (2012). The Counsellor (2013), Exodus (2014) and The Martian (2015) 




 I'm pretty sure its because he was fucking sienna millers character, I think that's the idea since he managed to get out of the drug game unscathed but was undone by something as trivial as sleeping with someone else's girl. 




 Wasn't this supposed to have been released in October? 




 Don't think it's ever mentioned and I believe that was the intention, he was never supposed to be known. 




 Definitely agree. Love the inspiration for their engine sounds in all Star Wars films.  




 Shiit same here haha i'm 23 atm just graduated from uni and I swear my mum never wants me to leave... 




 Hahah yep, they do love their tron legacy soundtrack, with good reason though since it's fucking amazing.  




 I would just like to say that I fucking LOVE this film. Such a fantastic film on the drug trade. Daniel Craig kills it as the main character and rightfully so since they got him for Casino Royale after this film. Matthew Vaughn can direct man, he manages to inject a certain flavour into every scene, I can't really describe it but it just feels so well composed you know? I would urge anyone who hasn't seen this film to check it out right now! Here's two of my favourite scenes in the film both with excellent music to boot. 

[Opening monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_0D8F_X7us)

[The facts of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U4aCMIBYSY) 




 End of Line by Daft Punk from the Tron Legacy film.  




 It's Thai. 




 First time I heard this was in Spec Ops:The Line, perfect use of the music, great soundtrack as well everyone should check it out.  




 I really love the idea of Kanan not being a fully trained Jedi since there is room for his character to learn just as much as Ezra, I like the idea of him not having the answers and being upfront with it as well.  




 Yeah that's true, didn't put that together. Damn shame really, I would have loved to see him have one last crack at the title in the Mclaren-Honda. 




 So 2014 is wrapped up and Button doing fairly well to get a 5th position what do you think his chances of him staying at Mclaren are? 




 God damnit seriously JB better get a seat next year, he truly deserves to have one more crack at the title in a good car.  




 [Not like this, not like this...](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-30744-not-like-this-not-like-this-gi-DBvb.gif) 




 I think I am [well versed](http://simpsonswiki.com/w/images/thumb/0/00/Big_Book_of_British_Smiles.png/250px-Big_Book_of_British_Smiles.png) 




 What were his ideas for the Hobbit films? 




 I would say the Counsellor, it's not an amazing film but I think it's an interesting one, worth checking out in my opinion. 




 I'm fairly sure she did the 50 shades version as well.  




 It's by Beyonce i'm pretty sure. 




 I always thought Daniel Crag in Layer Cake nailed it in this [scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_uwF9y8SQ) 




 I wish I was old enough to see and understand The Matrix when that first came out in the cinemas, alas I was only 8 years old though :( 




 So I played through ME2/3 on my PS3 back when they came out, however I decided to rebuy ME2 on PC since I wanted the faster load times/higher resolution etc but the DLC for ME2 never seems to go on sale. It's not listed on Origin and it is only sold on the Bioware store which you have to purchase with Bioware points...seriously who thought this would be a good idea? 




 The majority here would disagree with me but fuck you anyway, I think Star Wars Ep 3 is a fantastic prequel story wise. It sets up the tragic fall of Anakin and essentially sets the tone for Ep 4. The story imo was all wound up very neatly. It would be a perfect film if Lucas wrote the story but not the screenplay.  




 Jennifer Aniston for best actress, you wot m8? 




 I think people are a bit confused since there have been so many dystopia films that have been released in the last few years that all borrowed heavily from 1984.  




 I would love to get back into this but the PC community in Australia is pretty much dead :( 




 Jurassic Park (1993) 




 The rumour was that Netflix aus will be $20/month, is this true? I already have a US netflix account and vpn so unless the catalogue is just as good as the uk/us netflix then i'm not sure if I want to switch just yet.  




 Holy shit I didn't even realise Louis CK was in this one [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29PG-8Tywo)! 




 According to Hans Zimmer they are actually working on releasing the track for free. Here's the [source](http://hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco id=1256) which I got from the [Nolan Fans forum](http://www.nolanfans.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43 t=12452 start=1200) if you scroll down you can see where they discuss it.  




 Yep I travelled to Hong Kong in Jan and they had [these](http://annatam.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_3635.JPG). It really baffles me that countries which have the infrastructure and money to put these in place don't do it. 




 I have been waiting for a question like this...In no particular order. 

1. Oblivion (2013)
2. Tron Legacy (2010)
3. Avatar (2009)
4. Prometheus (2012)
5. Elysium (2013)
6. Pixar animated films as well as some Dreamworks films such as How to Train your Dragon
7. Rush (2013)
8. Cloud Atlas (2012)
9. Inception (2010)
10. Any Studio Ghibli film. 
11. Gravity (2013)
12. Interstellar (2014) whenever that Blu ray gets released.  




 lol 




 The set design looks unreal. 




 OP if you enter the code MAYHEM100 at [Dick Smith's online store page](http://www.dicksmith.com.au/markdown-mayhem-100) you will get $100 off a new PS4. Also unfortunately we don't really have Black Friday sales here, I guess the closest type of sales are Boxing day sales so basically the few days after Christmas where you can get some pretty decent deals. 




 Hmm I would say Michael Mann but then again he only has 2 films which kind of disappointed me (Miami Vice, Public Enemies). It's only because they were back to back though. I have high hopes for Blackhat since I would just love to see his take on the hacker underworld.  




 I reckon this Alfred will eventually grow into a Caine-esqe Alfred. Starts off a fiesty/bad ass and slowly starts to reign it in when Bruce probably gets into trouble during his teen/early adult years.  




 Hahah that bug for me will go down as one of the most hilariously frustrating bugs to ever exist in gaming.  




 Hey guys this is my first post on this sub but I was kinda wondering what cues do you think FO4 could take from newer games engine wise, ranging from graphics to physics.  




 [The Descendants](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033575/) 




 I would love this but I feel that it may be a tad too dark for the network, although with that being said the latter seasons of Clone Wars got pretty fucking dark so they may be able to make it work . 




 I loved seeing this gif with flags superimposed over their faces during the world cup.  




 lrn 2 read m8 









 I think city circuit would be pretty dope as well. Something around New York, although as a Sydney resident I have always dreamed of having them race across the harbour bridge.
