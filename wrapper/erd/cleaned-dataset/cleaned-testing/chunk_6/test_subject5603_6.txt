 He's already [whining](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-22/walker-says-obama-religion-question-is-why-people-hate-the-media?cmpid=yhoo) about it. 




 OK then, let's think of the questions the media should be asking Scott Walker.  My suggestion would be, why do you feel you have the right to tell America so many [inaccuracies, misleading statements, and outright lies](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/)? 









 Here's a [start](http://www.progressive.org/news/2014/10/187897/scott-walker%E2%80%99s-corruption-problem). 




 None of this nonsense about tailoring bills to local needs.  Just pass the bills handed to you from Koch Industries.  Walker has sure increased Wisconsin's government efficiency, and made it much more responsive to its most important constituents.  




 They should use this bill as a campaign slogan - 'Passing laws written by out of state lobbyists for the People of Wisconsin' or 'Bringing legislation from lobbyists directly to you!' 




 Well now, that should clear up any final doubts about who Walker and the Wisconsin GOP are  working for. 




 Stop that.  You're going to wise up the American voter.  




 I prefer to think of him as their little "Scottie" dog.  Although now that you mention it, GOP could be an acronym for Greed's Obedient Puppets.  




 I'm sure Scott Walker loves America.  He just loves it's richest people better than the rest. 




 Giuliani's message these days is -  'Hey, I'm saying something outrageous, listen to me ! Over here, look at me!  Pay attention to me, to me!"  




 They [the Republicans] are attempting to cast themselves as the party of the middle class, even as they push policies that would undermine working families and exacerbate income inequality, the official said.

Why the Democrats haven't been pushing this such G.W. Bush took office, I'll never understand.  









 Welcome to Wisconsin - America's Low Wage, High Profit Paradise 




 Believers ignore evidence. No amount of failure will change the minds of the supply-siders.  They'll always be a reason that something else is causing the failure, and the policies will work, [just give it more time](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-rose/article7024256.html). Which is the excuse of failures everywhere. 




 All of Obama's cherished deficit reduction  accomplished at gruesome cost to the American people  will go straight to the 1 percent if Walker (or Jindal, or Jeb Bush) is elected.

Why don't the American people ever wise up to this game? 









 Voodoo Redux! 




 He sure is. An honest campaign slogan for Walker would be something like 'Help me help the richest' or 'Concentrating America's wealth at the top'. 




 I don't have an on-line source for this, but in The Empire of Liberty (Oxford History of America) page 577 reads "Although some of the founders ... were fairly devout Christians, most leading Founders were not deeply or passionately religious and few had much of a spiritual life ... Most of them, at best only passively believed in organized Christianity and, at worst, privately scorned and mocked it."  The leaders of the Revolution were more often men of the Enlightenment than men of the Bible.  
And on page 578 ... "it has been estimated that scarcely one in twenty Americans was a member of a formal member of a church."
The importance of religion ebbs and flows in American history.  As you point out it was very important a number of the colonies I should have said revolutionary , not colonial America), and would rise again during the second Great Awakening, but at the time of the revolution and the nation's founding, American was a largely secular place. (And I've oversimplified the situation in my summary here.  Get a hold of the Empire of Liberty if you want to learn more.  You'll be better informed about the early years of America than almost all your fellow citizens.)
Edit: Missing sentence 




 The Puritans certainly looked to the Old Testament for inspiration, so I guess you'd have a point.  However, colonial America wasn't a particularly religious society, many of our Founding Fathers were skeptical of religion (or indifferent church members)  and current form evangelical Christianity barely existed until the 19th century.  Do you think the Oklahoma legislators wants the AP course to cover those topics? I'm guessing not. 




 I'm glad to hear it that it's discussed in churches.  It's a very demanding message, but I can't ever recall anyone suggesting that we display it in courtrooms or public buildings.  




 P.J. O'Rourke was quite funny back in his prime. And that's my complete list of conservative humorists whose work I've enjoyed.  




 But not the [Sermon on the Mount](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7).  Somehow these fundamentalists always manage to overlook the inconvenient parts of the New Testament. 




 If racism consisted of being too nice to people who are different than oneself, we probably wouldn't see it as a major problem. 




 Interesting. Precisely who is giving me marching orders?
 




 The IRS estimates that a stunning 56 percent of business income that individual returns should have reported went unreported in 2006, the latest year for which these data are available.

Who knew that [Leona Helmsley](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1891335_1891333_1891317,00.html) was a prophet? 




 Almost like a Biblical curse, isn't it? 




 Hope you're right.  But the math that worries me is the billion dollars the Koch Brothers are organizing for the election. 




 Paul Ryan - Nobody serves America's tax cheats better! 




 They want their own little obedient 'Scottie' dog to run the country for them. Since their goal is clearly to concentrate America's wealth at the top, they'll want a well trained puppy like Walker 









 They all work great in theory ... it's when you involve actual human beings they run into problems. 




 The article starts out with the question how does broadband in the US compare to other countries?  Well, if you remove the most populous states, which are the areas that have the densest population, (where you wouldn't have the physical limitations) from the comparison, I guess it looks pretty good.   




 FTFY - If you break up the US, none of the 10 most populous states make the list for the 10 fastest broadband places in the world.   




 I hope your right, but I'm not so sure.  The Koch Brothers and friends are planning on spending a billion dollars in 2016.  Might be enough to put anyone over the top. 




 His slash-and-burn policies of the past four years have nothing to do with responsible state governance. But they do signal to billionaire GOP campaign donors that he is willing to ride roughshod over the needs of the people in Wisconsin to prove that he can do the two things required of any contender for top office: Concentrate power in the executive office and **redistribute wealth upwards**. 

Why else would the Koch Brothers be so keen on this guy?  So we can have an economic system that's fair to everyone?

 









 Also Monday, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office reported that Walker is delaying May debt repayment of $108 million to help balance the state's shortfall in the current budget ending on June 30.

Here come the accounting gimmicks.
 









 That's what a nation's enemies do, not its putative allies. 




 In the most recent poll, done in May 2014, a plurality, 42 percent, said God created humans in their present form

Damn that's a frightening number, isn't it? 




 Why doesn't the mainstream press call out or politicians on this nonsense?  How did we wind up with Rolling Stone as a better source of information than most of our "news" sources. 




 I meant the poor wages, no rights and exploitation part.  They can't be  owning up to that, are they? 




 But do you ever hear anybody point this out in the public debates about immigration? I haven't. 




 Thanks for the correction, I should have said few rights.  However, while illegal immigrants have rights under the law, the fear of arrest and deportation often means they are afraid to exercise and assert their rights, and have de facto no labor rights. 
edit: under the law, not until the law. 




 This is about my favorite comment about work and success. (Not too surprising. I hear you guys who go to MIT are pretty smart.)  I can look at my own career, and I see I've done reasonably well and worked reasonably hard, but luck (my first job happened to give me an opportunity to learn an in-demand skill ) and good judgement (choosing what tech skills to learn next) have had more to do with my success as hard work. There are plenty of people who have worked harder than I have and have a lot less to show for it.  




 I'm quite sure politicians of all persuasions will express a great concern about wage stagnation right up until Election day.  And then ... 




 If only she were an atheist as well. 




 Fits nicely with their climate change dodge. 




 Illegal immigrants are fearful for their jobs and have no rights.  Really, the new model for the American worker. Enjoy your future, American workers. 




 And will our legislators ever do anything about it? Probably not any time soon. It's like  tax cheating.  Their big donors benefit from loopholes and lax enforcement.  




 Out-of-state money, uninspiring opponents, and running in non-Presidential elections. Walker raised huge amounts of money to fight the recall In 2012. Wisconsin elected Tammy Baldwin to the Senate, who is about as far removed from Walker on the political spectrum as possible.  




 Given were the money if flowing, the Republican primary is looking like a Bush-Walker cage match.   




 It's probably more realistic strategy than running on his charisma and record of public service. 




 The Wisconsin tradition of fine public education - That's so over.

Edit: missing word

 









 Just in case anyone still isn't clear on the GOP agenda.  




 Nothing's more important to America's future than checking everyone's urine. 









 So extending the logic a bit, we don't need to pay Congress's   technology because Abraham Lincoln wrote with an ink pen.  We should stop paying for their airplane tickets to go to their district because James Madison traveled by horse drawn coach.  And we should remove the plumbing from Congress because if an outdoor privy was good enough for the Founding Fathers , it's good enough for clowns like Dave Brat. 




 Or better still, use state employment as a reward for your cronies and toadies.   




 Blaming civil servants and bureaucrats distracts from the fundamental unfairness of the U.S. economy.   




 Nope, he's proved himself a useful tool for the 1%.  I'd say he's the Republican Party's leading Presidential candidate. 




 We're not joking about the incident, we're joking about the Republicans transparent and self-serving attempt to manufacture a nonexistent scandal out of a tragedy. That's what's messed up. 




 I'm sure they won't have any problem sacrificing their constituents access to health care in order to show how principled they are.  




 We can't have citizens who can think for themselves.  We like 'em ignorant and docile. /s 




 Yeah, a blue state Republican really needs to watch the rhetoric. 




 ghazi needs to become a suffix, like -gate,  for all Republican ['scandals'](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/08/08/president-obamas-16-watergates-so-far/200358) .  Net neutrality-ghazi, IRS-ghazi, Birth Certificate-ghazi 




 So, I'm guessing "I misspoke" must be a Kansas regionalism for "I lied".

 




 In today's least surprising piece of news, more evidence that Ted Cruz is a hypocrite. 




 Control of Congress has allowed the Republican Party to defer its public campaign against Mr. Obamas initiatives, since they are dead on arrival. But the G.O.P. will not have that luxury in 2016, when it will need to offer a more cogent and specific response than it has so far.

I'm sure they'll go with the usual, a tax break that largely goes to the wealthy. 




 Shlaes and other fantasy tax-plan advocates have a big problem: Their math doesn't work.

They already are!  Look at how good they are with imaginary numbers.

 




 Yeah, instead of being under the thumb of corporate interests, like a good lawmaker is supposed to be. 




 How about the party of arithmetic?  But none of those fractions, they're too hard! 




 I think the Koch's prefer their own dog, little 'Scottie' Walker from Wisconsin. 









 So naturally the Republicans have embraced it. It's kind of a pattern. 




 Well, we do want to encourage that Entrepreneurial Spirit.  And you got to work with what you got. But seriously, I think its largely a way to throw another obstacle in the way of our poorest citizens.  If they were really interested in reducing people cheating the government, they'd go after contractor fraud or tax cheating. That would save us a lot more money than food stamp ID's. 




 We could even get [Bernie himself](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/09/19/bernie-sanders-folk-album-president/) to sing the songs.  Although I get the impression [we might not want him to](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/18/sen-bernie-sanders-office-responds-to-the-unearthing-of-his-epic-folk-album.html) .  




 But wouldn't get a movie as good as American Sniper, would we? 




 A better person than myself would not take such joy in watching Schock twist and squirm.  Fortunately, I am not that better person. 




 Yes ,and the Democrats are the party of the 1%, and Louisiana's finances are excellent and look, it turns out that up is down and South is North.  This guy is really starting to sound desperate. Or he's auditioning for a spot on Fox News after his political career hits a hard stop 




 Excellent idea. Let's issue one to everyone who receives  food stamps, and then everyone on food stamps will have a valid government issued ID for voting. Although I wonder if the vote suppressing Republicans have truly thought this plan through.   




 He was hoping the 'fever would break' and he could reach some sensible compromises with the Republicans.  Sometimes optimism doesn't pay off. 




 We sent them a bill, representative Michael Burgess told Politico, and they need to pass it. They need to pass our bill. A tantrum is not far off. 

Yep, the Senate is supposed to pass all the bills the House sends it without modification.  Except then what's the point of having two chambers in Congress?   




 Judging from their views on economics, I think most Republicans find math a foreign language as well. 




 Hmm, you sound a whole lot [Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/opinion/paul-krugman-twin-peaks-planet.html) there, who I'm guessing you're not a fan of. And as he points out in the article, there are a number of other things going on.
Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.

 




 Christ almighty, the Keystone job bill again. It'll solve everything,  It's the 'key' to America's recovery. The corner'stone' to a bright American future.  C'mon GOP, you're not pushing it hard enough. 




 Butter him up and put him on plate. Rand Paul is toast.  Which is a shame.  I don't want him to be President, but if he stayed in the race as viable candidate, some of his better ideas, such as less foreign intervention and ending corporate welfare before reducing social programs might have become part of the Republican primary debate 




 You've got a point (especially about housing size), but, while we're looking at Pew Surveys, wouldn't you think this has something do with at well? http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/  




 The Foolish, Historically Illiterate, Incredible Response to Obama

Seems about par for the course. 




 I really hope 'drafting error' catches on as a euphemism for a lie. 




 Maybe.  But with full Republican control, we'll get the unrestrained  version, without any of that worker protection or rights nonsense. 




 Too bad Russ Feingold doesn't want to run again.   




 Wait until the Republicans have control of all 3 branches of the government.  They'll turn America into a high-profit, low wage paradise. 




 Somehow that concern about government waste and inefficiency disappears whenever its money for defense. 




 Brownback should turn it into a campaign slogan "Helping Kansas Children by spending Less on Education" or "Ensuring a Bright Future for Kansas through crappy schools".  




 This should be an issue during his presidential campaign.  Scott Walker couldn't find criminal activity is his own office, but he'll keep America safe from terrorists.  




 Agreed.  Wisconsin is turning into North South Carolina. 




 Wisconsin is apparently now part of Dixie. 




 And yet people think Ryan's a hypocrite about the deficit. Puzzling, no? 




 No, but they've made a good start. 




 He should make it into a campaign slogan : Scott Walker - Putting my out of state donors first!     




 Theyre not legislators, theyre just assholes, a senior GOP aide told CQ Roll Call

A comment that would apply to a lot of other 'legislators' as well. 














 Somebody had to step up, now that Michelle Bachmann isn't there to provide the crazy anymore. 




 Because their obeisance to wealthy interests and donors trumps their conservatism.   




 The GOP is making the Onion redundant.  




 Because the Republicans always win off year elections in Wisconsin. In presidential years, the electorate votes in Tammy Baldwin, who is about as close to the obverse of Scott Walker as you can imagine. 




 Sounds like an Onion headline, doesn't it?
 




 However, our Republicans Presidential candidates are [out in front](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/05/12/where-the-2016-gop-contenders-stand-on-climate-change/) of the climate scientists and the American public on this issue.  /s 




 I was fifteen or sixteen and many of my friends smoked. I didn't really have an idea what being addicted to something meant, but I sure found out.   




 Sure, I'll try a cigarette.
