 "When the rich wage war it's the poor who die" - Linkin Park 




 The link wont update but I had changed from a lightning build to physical for GRing, And I've incorporated the changes you suggested. What stats are best on a RoRG? 




 I'm stuck around GR 37 because i keep dying too easily. What gear should I gamble on/re-roll to help me progress?

 Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.  




 If i am using this picture (http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg[1] ) as a reference for the axial tilts of the solar system, will these numbers always be correct? Could they also be negative instead of positive depending on from where you view the planets?
