 Give us a number and a list.   Feel free to explain your answer. 









 You can only pick one. 




 You may not select your own team.  You may downvote those who can't follow instructions. 




 ...and why?   Let's keep it to NFL teams only. 




 Mini golf and gelato is my go-to first date combo.   




 Feel free to go into detail of your favorite Italian dishes at the restuarants, the ambiance, if you've had real Italian food in Italy before, etc, etc.

Maybe that's how they ate tacos in the 80s.  Thanks! 









 Please tell us about the type of paella, vegetarian or not, etc.  Thanks! 




 Be sure to describe the slaw for us (creamy, vinegary, etc).  Thanks! 




 Restaurants, museums, residential areas, sights, parks, bars, schools, media outlets, stores, people, etc, etc.  Feel free to explain why you think it's overrated.  Have fun! 




 Please mention where they tend bar.  Keep in mind we're not talking about the best bar...  just the best tenders.  And not the best chicken tenders.  That was a different post. 




 Feel free to describe them as well. 




 There are some obvious gems like Sushi Club, Edelweiss' buffet days, Spice Nation, etc.  Curious as to which others you guys know about, love, etc.

Edit:  Feel free to share pertinent details such as what they offer, if only certain days/times, if it is all-you-can-eat, vegan, price, etc.  (if you happen to know them) 




 For instance, the bias toward particular teams, downvoting trends, etc.
