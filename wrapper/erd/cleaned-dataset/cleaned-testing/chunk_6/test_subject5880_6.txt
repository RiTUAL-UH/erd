 Nice new meme

I can feel the aura of dankness in this one.  




 Some girl just put her titties all up in the camera. 

Nice.  




 Nice account name. 

 yeah, man. It's a real bummer to see that a girl that small was taken advantage of. It's a real hard thing to grow up with, as it can both subconsciously and consciously effect every relationship you have from that point onward. Trust does not become a thing without time and proper help, and anxieties are high. 

Some people just really don't think about that too often.  




 Kinda looks like an everyman, to me.  




 It appears as if they

 Reminds me of the [I'm Drunk AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/2gjf7u/im_drunk_ama/) where a guy got shasted, asked himself questions, answered his own questions, and then publically berated his own answers to his own questions.

"Can confirm. Have same dick."

 In the code of the web-page they call it "the experiment."

 Someone should dig into the coding of the subreddit web page and see what secrets/Easter Eggs/purpose they can find!

I'm not very good at web design, but so far I've found [proof that "the experiment" will end](http://imgur.com/aw9STqQ) in the form of a preset error string, as well as this funny [hidden message](http://imgur.com/PjiVXys).

 I know this is old but I geeked so hard, man. Checking up on this whole Scott Stapp charade after he seems to have fallen out of the new's scope of interest. 




 Pretty poor article. I feel that it's biased, the writer isn't knowledgeable on the topic, and it's not even spell checked.   




 I agree with you.

I'm a vaper, and I have no problem with a business banning the use of electronic cigarettes indoors. The only problem is that when state law mandates that no one can use electronic cigarettes indoors, the stores who sell the product will no longer legally be able to offer people to try their products in-store before they buy them. That's the only issue I have with this ordeal. If someone tells me I can't do it in their shop - I will respect that. But if the law prevents vendors from making sales and from users being able to try before they buy, that's a bummer.

The increased taxation is the biggest bummer. Both Illinois and Washington have been fighting bills to prevent 90%+ taxation on not only e-liquids but the actual hardware vaporizers. Electronic cigarettes are not a tobacco product as much as nicotine gum is not a tobacco product. In addition, many people use e-liquid that contains no nicotine - however they will still be mandated to pay that heavy sales tax. It doesn't make sense :(. 




 It's not just found in pantry items, however. Propylene Glycol, for instance, is used as a solvent for medications. A great example is the medication Dilantin. When applied intravenously, the medication is 40% propylene glycol.  




 It "stains"  "less". 

Not "stainless"

 I have a person,  in my COLLEGE course, who will ask the professor a question (during class. Like in front of the whole class) , and then begin to Masturbate. In class. I don't know if he actually knows that he's doing it. I've been graced by his presence the last two semesters in two different courses.  




 Nonono, you don't see the point of it.

 See, you just have to use the bottom of the fire extinguisher to bust the lock and open the door.  




 Yup. I had a final project in the form of a PowerPoint. Just opened the document in hex editor, deleted a couple of lines, saved, and wallah.  




 That can't be real.

 Here I am thinking,  oh, I have a small bit of time to read reddit before I fall asleep. Horrible mistake.  




 STOP WITH THIS FUCKING MEME ALREADY 




 I do also totally disagree with what you have quoted. But while the memory will always be there, the feelings you have white remembering it won't always be the same. I'd argue that they do change over time. I'd argue against him saying that you'll "never feel that hurt" . That's sort of absurd.  




 [So, I have a shirt with both the title of your reddit post and the date you made it.] (http://imgur.com/jogeVPt) I figured that was a strange coincidence and I ought to share. 

I do agree with parts of your argument. I think the saying was meant for the purpose of portraying that depression is not always permanent. I've personally seen how time and time again the blind depression can put over you will make it feel as if it will last forever until that blind is removed with professional help.

Incredible. Funniest and cutest trippy music video I've ever seen.

 "Prius" is the key word here. All they do is cut off other drivers.  




 "God is Great"  




 Ahah, it felt like a dream! It was like that feeling you get when you're bored in class and wish you could freeze time to screw everyone in the room had just come true! I hope we hook up, too. I'm pretty good with reading people and I've got a great feeling about this, so I think we will :).  




 Thank you so much :). Happy to share a smile. I've seen quite a few success stories around here and I've been waiting to be able to have one to share.  




 I really like mine! I don't really like the Infinite CLT v2 I've got on top of it, however, but I'll take what I can get for cheap. 









 I've too taken Effexor - it's a hell of a drug!

I often think I should end things with him simply to spare him from me.

I don't recommend this. Once you've completed tapering and it's out of your system, you may regret that decision and it may be irreparable. Consider this: Maybe he's not tiring of you, and those thoughts only stem from insecurities that the tapering might have quite a bit of an effect on. Maybe you go to end it to spare him, but he was never tiring of you at all.

I'd say to let him decide to end it if he decides he's tiring of you - however I don't think that anyone worth having in your life will tire of you due to your depression. 




 Here's a long but funny anxiety narrative. 

Although I used to go from relationship to relationship and get used here and cheated on there, the failure of my last relationship (and my longest at about a year and a half) motivated me to take some time to be alone and become more independent. I put up a wall around my heart, and I learned how to be comfortable by myself while working to mend my anxiety and depression both on my own and with some professional help. However, I've recently met this girl who I think I'm ready to chase after.

In my college math course, there is this girl who sits two tables in front of me - out of sociable range - and she is just stunningly gorgeous. However I spent weeks of class just stealing glances at her not knowing how to start up conversation. I realized that she started to worm her way into my mind quite a bit even outside of class. My buddy who sits next to me in class (who probably became annoyed with me talking about her so much) kept pushing me to just approach her and get her number, but those with anxiety know that you have to wait for the perfect timing - even if it doesn't ever come.

However on Thursday, I noticed that she began to start turning around quite a bit more to glance at me during class as well. After that, I noticed that she overheard a joke I made, laughed at it, and turned around to add on to the joke, and we both laughed together. 

At the end of the class that day, we were working on an impossible group quiz. Me and my buddy were still working on it way past the end of class, as was she with her 6 person group. I didn't think by any means that I would have figured out the answer to the question the whole class was stuck on, but I managed to, and got up to turn my quiz in and dip out for the day - however, I first stopped over by her group to see if they wanted to copy my answers. 

She was immediately thankful, as was the whole group, however she then told me that I was, "like the nicest person ever." At that point she got up out of her chair and looked me right in the eyes. The connection was overwhelming. Then, when she spoke to me, my mind made an awful twist of her words - as we were making eye contact, she said, "Can I fuck you?"

My mind went completely blank. My anxiety soared into hyperdrive, and I had entered complete autopilot. I don't even know if I said anything - I most likely just gave her a blank stare. My mind was fighting with my ears trying to replay the words back in my head while a monkey was clashing two cymbals together and I was not good at multi-tasking between the two thought processes.

Then, she came towards me and just wrapped her arms around me, as I wrapped mine around her. Over a span of just a few moments I went from having no contact and being trapped in my own obsessions, to looking each other in the eyes and having a heartfelt connection that happened out of nowhere.

The words she said were, "Can I hug you?" Thank god I didn't have to bend her over on the table in front of all of these people.

She introduced herself, as did I, and I told her that it was really nice to have met her. I think the monkey clashing cymbals really took over at that point because I can't remember whether or not I even acknowledged her presence after that point or what happened next, but I was completely overwhelmed with happiness. My heart didn't stop racing for the next hour, and me and my buddy exchanged high fives and jokes both about the misheard words and about how I managed to swoon the poon with my math skills. 

I've decided that when my children ask me how to get chicks, I'll tell them that they've just gotta find the zero of that polynomial. Gotta get the maths to get the girls.

I'll update this in the future, however now that the ice has been broken in a non-awkward way, I'll be getting her number as soon as I get back from spring break. I've got a really great feeling about this one, and I'm pretty sure some day soon this beautiful girl will be mine :)

I can attest to this being incorrect.

Listen to loud music

Masturbate again

In regards to NI's Maschine, I'm looking into it and I'm confused. There is a picture of a midi controller looking thing on NI's page. Is Maschine both a controller and a software that works with it, or is Maschine just a piece of software? 




 HOW does one do this? I've always wanted to turn the environment around me into music, and I believe I've got the correct mindset, but how does one translate these things so well into a computer? I'm a Computer Science major, and yet I still have yet to be able to link my creativity to music programs like FL Studio - I just get stuck watching tutorials on how to mathematically craft sounds from sine waves - and these sounds  are just garbage to begin with. Is there something out there that is better?

 Hi, I'm child and this is JACKASS!  




 Upon entering the website and clicking the menu, I was redirected to multiple websites, the last of which being [flyapk.com](http://www.Google.com), which popped up an onscreen notification alerting me that I had a virus, and immediately redirecting me to a anti-virus program on the Google play market. 

I've terminated my Google Chrome executable and restarted multiple times but it comes right back up to this website being the only tab open. I'll probably see what I can do to wipe the cache or just reinstall Chrome. 

I don't know if by chance you've implemented advertisements and a certain ad causes this issue or what, but it's pretty uncool. Figured I'd let you know.

 I feel that USPS takes 12-24 hours to update theirs usually. 

Edit: although it seems like UPS has been only [2-3 hours off]( http://imgur.com/1NlOFul) 
 the last few days. Maybe they have to dig it out of the trash.  




 Lol, they are so out of money.  




 Ayyyy! Hope there's no natural disaster or an airstrike that takes out the delivery next. With all that's happened it's pretty probable.

I don't understand what's going on. Checked for updates 10 times today but the last news was that smog was on the phone with them. Not sure what the outcome was. Also not sure if this customs shit is open on the weekend anyways. 

It also looks like it went from Alaska to Cali anyways, so maybe if he talked his way into Cali from AK he can talk it into his house by Monday   it's still on time?
