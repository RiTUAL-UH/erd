 I didnt like him in anime, but when i read the manga i took liking of him, he went trough so much development imho. 




 I m really intrested how long will this thing last. 




 yeah It was very creative in its own way, would like to meet person who came up with this 




 Ok Im not qualified to be saying this but you should probably visit psychologist, but dont let them watch it if you want to stay out of assylum
 




 this anime is not only shit, its also about shit and other stuff^ohh^the^memories^comin^back
 




 something like  Bondage Game: Unlimited Bondage Works ?
