 I don't agree. I was curious when I read about your screwdriver mishap, and so I clicked through your username. You seem like an amazing, funny, generous, resilient person. Your husband is lucky to have you.  




 Of course not.  Her hands were at her side...  




 I'm going to say something crazy.  I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you.  I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain.  Too many endorphins. 

Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...

But none of it was as bad as the pain I had when I got swimmer's ear at 12.  THAT was the worst pain I've ever had.  I wanted to claw my way out of my body.  




 Hold up guys, you're jumping the gun.  A potential start date is a normal interview question.  It has to do with whether you're a conscientious employee who is going to give notice to your current employer.  If you're actually going to get the job at your level (an engineer), they're going to present you with an offer letter.  That letter is going to tell you your salary.  Benefits are not something you'll get FULL details on until you're an employee because it is proprietary.  What they will tell you is what they offer in general terms (medical, HSA, life, dental) they may disclose if it is a high deductible, but they don't have to.   




 Site your sources, please.

Edit: I'm being serious, I'm Googling in vain trying to find people who have hurt themselves because they AREN'T trying to be hygienic about their periods.  Plenty of improper use, but nothing here about letting it soak into your clothes being dangerous.  I've never heard of this being an issue in a third world country, I'm very sincerely curious.   




 Well, provided you actually still get your period (many active women do not, and if you aren't eating properly, your body will shut it down), you could use a menstrual cup.  Really, though, we're talking about being in a trench with the intent of killing other people.  You're going to get dirty.  It's not like your period is an illness.  You're just dirty in a different way.  It's a non-issue.  




 Well, so far we've had Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea minted on dollar coins.  Neither would have been my first choice.  I'd like to see Madeline Albright or Condoleezza (I've retired from politics to teach) Rice on a bill, but I know that will never happen. 




 Well, since my daughter was born, I don't save anything.  I've been trying, but it's just not very likely.  In order to save to my actual savings, I would need to decrease my contribution to my Roth 401k, and it's important to put in as much as  you can as early as you can, so I think that's the priority.  After my bills and my deduction for retirement (About $2000, which is mostly essential things like $220 a paycheck for health insurance, $200 a week for daycare), my take home is about $500, which I must take my phone bill, fuel for my car, and student loans out of.  This leaves me with roughly $100 a week in "mad money." I save little if any of it.   




 I've tried something like six times now to make it through the last season of Nip/Tuck.  Finally I just read the damn Wikipedia article, pictured it in my head, and left it at that.  I think one season into the move to L.A. it was sort of watchable, but enter Hearts and Scalpels, and all of a sudden it was literally painful to watch.  I don't know if there was some unhappiness but a long network contract or what the deal was.

 Pros


-Won't be as prone to run away from home

-Won't bleed on your furniture

-Can't have unexpected puppies

-Won't die from complications of birth (lots of dogs, like English Bulldogs, need assistance up to and including surgery to give birth to a litter)

-Stabilized mood

Cons


-Can be expensive if you don't qualify for financial assistance

Edit: formatting and typo fix 




 The poncho is a staple of failed fashions to be reintroduced every five years.  Check out your local consignment shop (Goodwill, Savers) you can probably find an array of ponchos from as recently as the year 2007. 




 African Americans are 13.2% of the US Population, and yet make up 60% of the total prison population.  




 Are you really trying to tell me that when Will Parish gets all choked up describing what his wife was wearing the first time he met her your stone cold heart doesn't break just a little? I don't believe it. I bet you blubber like a baby. It's okay, man, me too.  




 For real, though. There are two scenes in this movie that make me cry every single time. I got the VHS set for Easter when I was, like, 14. Great choice, man!  




 Right, the point was about accepting personal responsibility. Yes, sometimes things happen to use that we wouldn't choose, but what we can choose is how to overcome. :) 




 1) I expect nothing.

2) Haven't you ever seen those posts on Facebook where they show like a turn key for opening a can of sardines with text like "Like if you know what this is... Don't give it away!"

3) You know what I'm sick of?  Older people telling me about how unfortunate I am to not know what it is to have spent my childhood outside or to be unwired.  Hello, I didn't have a cellphone until I was 21, and we were outside all the time.  My SNES had a strict half hour a day limit on it.  It's called parenting.  By the same ticket, it's not "impressive" that I listen to talk radio or like Led Zeppelin.

4) What even IS a 90's kid?  I was born in 1987, and I'm the first to admit that anything prior to 1995 is a bit blurry.  I found out who Nirvana was at 15.5 years old.  Yet I'm told people born in '98 consider themselves to be 90's kids?  Call me crazy, but I think you should probably have to remember the actual decade to associate with it.  Like my husband.  Graduated HS in 1994.  THAT'S a 90's kid.  




 This isn't a city, but I was SHOCKED at how beautiful Nebraska was... I mean, I had always heard it was so boring, the most boring state there is, even... look, Iowa and Indiana both have much worse landscapes... Gentle hills covered in tall grass that moves in the wind is quite beautiful! You know what isn't?  Acres of soybeans.  And in Indiana?  Even the billboards are boring.  




 It's okay, man.  My disclosure is currently sitting at 0 points.  This is precisely what I'm talking about in my response.  We shouldn't have to gird our loins because more often than not people choose to be vindictive.   




 Senpai just noticed me, ladies.  Check that off the bucket list.  

My daughter had a lip and a tongue tie.  We had the tongue tie corrected when she was two weeks old, but the lip tie was too minor to do anything about.  She was making me bleed and I ended up getting mastitis twice.  I spent very close to a grand on lactation counseling before I ended up just exclusively pumping for two months.  I got mastitis again, and finally when I got Reynauld's syndrome from pumping for about six hours a day, I had to admit I was missing the forest for the trees and needed to accept it was over.  I needed to dry up, realize that she wasn't going to starve because she was on formula, and give all this time back to her.  It was still really hard and I still want to cry talking about it.  




 This seems to have turned into an "unattractive generalization about my gender" type of thread.  My answer to the actual question is that I let my daughter sleep on her stomach and I failed at breastfeeding before we even hit three months.  

To join the party: I've experienced more sexism and misogyny from other women than I ever have from men.  If you are a smart and capable, dependable type of person, I will do everything in my power to pull you up and beyond my level.  Pulling people down doesn't do anything but hurt your soul.  Stop doing that!  




 This sounds exactly like something me and my sister would think up playing with our Barbies.  It's not a good Barbie game without a serial killer involved.  Sounds like this kid took it one step further.  I approve.  Future novelist.  




 There is no such thing as divine retribution.  Good things don't exclusively happen to good people, and bad people might never get their comeuppance.  

To expound on that idea, once people get over it, you're only a victim if you allow yourself to see it that way.  You are the only person who is uniquely in charge of your own destiny.  If you hate the way things are, you can change your entire reality.  You really are the only thing that is holding you back.  




 It's getting better.  That bullshit about getting pre-qualified for 4.25 times my annual wages would never happen post-bank reform.  We're seeing the beginning of college tuition reform.  As someone who is getting old enough to think about the younger generation, I'm actually optimistic.  For while the way they go about things isn't always what I would do, I sure as heck wasn't fighting against inequality at age 12.  Young people are more conscientious, civil rights minded, and generous than I think they've ever been.  I am also seeing a shifting of values insofar as life-goals, which are more aligned with the reality of inflation and the wage-gap.  Marriage and homeownership are being replaced with travel and experiences.  While that isn't what I've chosen for myself, it's certainly more cost effective and probably more satisfying for people who don't want to look back and have regrets. 

Sorry about how sentimental this reply was.  




 Ignore the "7 second rule" on the freeway.  The theory prevents tailgating.  For every 10 mph you're traveling, you should have 1 second between you and the next car.  You count them by waiting for them to pass a traffic light or sign and then count aloud.   




 This isn't really all that creepy, but I did shoot a soda out of my nose when she asked me this at age 9: "What's the difference between menstruation and masturbation?  Because I can't really tell the difference."  Clearly, this is what happens when you are desperate to seem more knowledgeable than you are.    




 Well, another thing to look for is something that your dad uses everyday, but would never spend a lot of money on for himself... like a coffee maker.  If he loves coffee, but bought the $20 Mr. Coffee model from Wal-Mart, replace it for him.  What kind of razors does he use?  Does he use $.99 Shampoo?  Scott toilet paper?!  Just give him a nice version, and make a joke about it.  Royal treatment on me, dad. :) 




 Technically, I have already obtained my version of the American dream.  I have a career, I'm a homeowner, I'm married, and I have a child that I'm able to support without financial aid of any sort.  Despite my considerable amount of financial responsibility, I'm still able to put 12% of my wages into my retirement fund, and if I retire at 65, I'll have enough to live comfortably until I'm 90.  I'm not yet 30 years old.  I'm also making enough money to pay my mother a high enough wage to enable her to stay at home with my baby.

I think my success where a lot of millennials are coming up short has to do with proper financial education, which I'm sorry to say did not come from high school or college, but from my mother.  The danger in my mind is over-extending yourself.  

The first time I went in and got pre-qualified for a homeowner's loan, my husband and I were making a total of $40k a year.  We were approved for $170k.  Right now we're a $75k per year family with a $70k mortgage, which isn't even as much as I was pre-qualified for on my wages alone (pre-qualified for $95k).

I was also advised from the time I was 16 that I need to contribute to my retirement as soon and as much as I can, as you need time for your money to compound.  Later, I had a retired family member tell me how much he regretted putting most of his money in a traditional 401k instead of in a Roth account.  I immediately took his lament to heart. 

I got my first credit card at 16 so I could begin building my credit.  I've got a score of over 800.

I've never paid a car payment in my life, since a car is only worth getting you from point A to point B... it will never be a lasting investment.  Better to just shell out for that junker, run it dead, then move on to the next one.

tl;dr: I think it depends on how much common sense parents are able to instill in their children.  It's possible to have everything you want and more if you know early on what it takes to hit your aims.    




 Although, I have to say, his sister is a class act too.  My Great grandfather was an amazing wood worker, and he made these lovely matching boxes as his and his wife's final resting place (they both wanted to be cremated).  Debbie took their ashes out and had them converted to JEWLERY BOXES.  My great grandparents are currently in ziplock bags at the child molester's house. :-/ 




 My great uncle.  He's a child molester.  He's assaulted my mother (she was 12), raped my aunt (she was 15), and one of his daughters suffered from urinary incontinence until her 20's while the other just completely shut down at age five and didn't speak again until she was about 10... so I can't say for sure there, but it stands to reason.     




 You should try to think of a gift that is based upon an innocuous detail he mentioned at some point.  

I remember once when I was 20, I came in to visit my grandpa wearing a pair of Chuck Taylor hi-tops.  He told me he had a pair just like them in the 1960's.  They were white and his wife had thrown them out.  Now he was in his 80's and I'd never seen him wear anything but cowboy boots, so instead of actually replacing them, I made him a photo-realistic portrait of a pair and gave it to him several years later. 

People love to feel like you're listening to them even when they don't have anything too terribly important to say.  




 Well, with 20 more characters, maybe I'd be more successful than I thought. (Just kidding! 2verbose2live) 




 He's my... uh.... 1st cousin twice removed, I think.... He back handed a toddler, Great Grandma didn't like it.  The irony is that there are a number of child molesters that Grandma never knew about that were/are about 12x more deserving of her ire.  




 I'm a big fan of https://twitter.com/katvapid

If I could be as snide, witty, and pithy as Kat in 120 characters, I'd actually have an account. :-/ 




 No man, they just [screw with Jell-O boxes.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/02/20/ethel_and_julius_rosenberg_how_a_jell_o_box_helped_convict_them.html)  




 Better yet, hire Steve Buscemi to give them the $10,000, gift card, and bad news.  Then kill yourself.  In your suicide note, admit you always loved that person.  Done.  Dust hands.  




 The way I eat is the most prevalent one.  I always put off eating better.  




 Yes, and then it all falls out.  I'm not even kidding.  




 I have a whole list of childhood crushes that are not altogether conventional:

-Marty Stouffer - Wild America (like PBS, not the movie with Devon Sawa)

-Tom Petty

-David Spade

-Dana Carvey

-Norbert - The Angry Beavers (stop judging me)

-Eric from Captain Planet

-Jesus Christ (I'm an atheist who loved beards from age 2)

-Brian May (from Queen)

... I could go on into my teens, but I think this is probably enough disclosure for this particular post.  




 A nail clipper.  There has never been a moment in my life where I think, man this nail clipper is a useless waste of space.  I'm always glad for it.  




 Well, I think that's down to preference and lifestyle. I am a woman, so I don't sweat a lot, and I work in an air conditioned office. You don't want to end up with the "Fitbit rot" so if you do choose to go with a rubber band, make sure you have enough slack for air to circulate and you clean it with isopropyl once a week. I think a better option in my mind would be a NATO band. They're made out of Nylon, more secure, washable, affordable, and have classic preppy style to them in a variety of colors. :) 




 Just be smart and earn people's respect through your performance.

The point was supposed to be that we shouldn't be upset about stuff we can't change, and even if it doesn't seem that way now, people how overcome the same issues at an even greater disadvantage.  Furthermore, what you're seeing as a defect is actually an asset in the minds of many people, so cheer up!  I was trying to make him feel better about something that is probably not going to change for a long time.  But, you know, thank you for all of your valuable contributions.  




 Thank you for attempting to help me, but what I meant is that while I know full well how to use it correctly, the majority of the population does not, so rather look like I'm wrong (while they would be wrong about that), I just revise. ;) 




 Well, you can see my advice regarding how to be taken seriously above.  




 Man, try being taken seriously as a woman who has a baby face and is also under five feet tall. I got offered a kids menu printed on a damn football while out to dinner with my company's CEO while I was 27 and six months pregnant. Just be smart and earn people's respect through your performance. 

Postscript: The next day I gave a performance summary to the second in command of the largest utility company in the United States about how I single handedly turned his outsourced program around... Like a boss.  




 Why would you want to fix your baby face? It's actually a proven fact that human beings are drawn to partners who look younger than they are due to viability of genetics. Men are even more attracted to women with vaguely babyish features... Here: http://study.com/academy/lesson/physical-traits-and-attraction-symmetry-ratios-the-babyface-phenomenon.html 




 Y-you got a reservation?  But how?  Damn it, Sean!  




 Guys, c'mon.  It think it's probably something like "Next round of golf is on me," in addition to the normal picking up the tab on drinks and meals.  




 Right, hence the "most people wouldn't trouble," I was making room for extreme pragmatists who use it as a means for manipulating situations by being highly aware of different aspects.  




 Well, probably because most people wouldn't trouble to imagine what it is like to be someone else and go through an event as that person if the experience didn't inspire some sort of emotional response in them.  When I'm empathizing, I also tend to communicate in a way that makes the person feel less alone while not being sympathetic (read: pitying them).

Edit: word 




 This is also my husband's birthday month.  I got him a ticket to see two symphonies by two of his favorite composers.  I also got him the complete Polar Bear Caf anime series since that kind of absurd humor would appeal to him and it's kid friendly.  Note: My husband is not my dad.  




 Well for one thing, my condescending old relatives wouldn't be able to post that transcript of his stupid graduation speech on Facebook once a week.  Guess what, not all of us take our parents for granted or think they're moronic and boring...   




 We all have preferences, and that's all they are: preferences.  Things don't become problematic until we're trying to force people into an ideal against their will.

Personally, I don't really find moderately overweight men or muscular men attractive.  My ideal is someone who lists slightly to the left in a strong wind (read: skinny af), however I happen to be married to someone who is perfectly average if a bit tall.  It's not a deal breaker and I'm not going to starve him to make him more attractive.  




 /u/late_night_grumbler He makes me laugh. 

Edit: I also really enjoy these thoughtful and intelligent ladies: /u/hugsouffle and /u/unsweet_tea 




 This is a great, well thought out comment.  Thank you for taking the type to write it out.  This is just what I was looking for. :) 




 Please don't post jokes about how you also only start half the time. I'm seriously curious about where the new-car mentality comes from.  




 It would, but not in the way you think it would.  This person would clearly need to be able to kill things with their mind.  The government would waste no time in kidnapping this person and then turning them into a wartime weapon!  The corpses resultant would nourish the earth.  The end.  




 Well, my sister had absolutely terrible taste in music.  She would listen to Good Charlotte, Ashlee Simpson, Trapt, Blue October, New Found Glory, Howie Day... I absolutely hated it then, and some of it I still do... but occasionally some idiotic song will come on and I'll like it in spite of myself because it reminds me of her.  This is the inverse of what you're asking.  




 No problem, man.  I'll mention too that at my old place they mandated the amount of notice you had to give based upon your pay schedule e.g. if you are salaried, you must give one month; if you are hourly, you must give two weeks.  




 You just gave me an eye twitch.  




 /r/advice But, hell, why not.  There is usually a difference between sick leave and vacation.  Some places don't differentiate and just call it PTO or Paid Time off.  You need to check your employer's policies.  There is usually a clause stating that you need to give notice IN WRITING and that you need to work all of the days in notice (unless the employer dismisses you) to be paid out for your vacation.   




 Well-groomed, charming, conventionally attractive guys.  If you use hair-gel and can charm strangers, I'm going to assume you have a great game and could possibly be carrying an STI.  I'm not about that life.  




 Sounds to me like you have a problem with being present.  Obviously we all need to think about the past or present on occasion, but the aim is to visit, not reside.  Instead of thinking about all the things you need to do next, focus on what you're doing now.  Try to enjoy it.  Your memory will improve.   




 I'd advise against taking this person's comment seriously. :-/ 




 This one is so prevalent that I actually re-write my sentences to not include them so that the majority will not assume I'm wrong for using "affect" more than not.  Yes, I have anxiety and worry about things like this.  




 Yeah.  In my high school there was only one Hispanic kid in the whole building.  I don't think I ever heard anyone call him by his real name.  It was always "beaner" or "wetback" or "brownie" or "spic..."  Now having moved to this area from a predominantly Hispanic community a state away, I was totally shocked and ask why the hell you would do something like that.  The response I always heard from the other kids was "He doesn't care, he knows we're not serious."   




 No, however my husband's first name is a common shortening of my own name.  You will not believe the moronic questions we get about it.  You would think we lived in the Good Burger sketch with the twins.  




 Real Talk: I'm sure the kid would come out with just as many issues, they would merely be different issues.  On paper, I have a much better life than my mom and those advantages would pertain to my child, however, circumstances aren't everything.  My mother never struggled with crippling anxiety.  She's a pretty happy person, if a bit insensitive to things she doesn't understand.      




 I don't know the names of any tracks, but my husband plays this bizarre atmospheric music that is pretty much a foghorn playing for 24 minutes and occasionally there will be this high pitched beeping that he can't even hear... Protip: if your dogs whimper because of the beeping in your music, it's no good.  Turn it off!  




 I totally get what you're saying, but you know, a "I'm sorry, I missed that..." would go a long way.  It's totally not fun to feel beneath notice. 




 YES!  My husband fucking tells his mother everything, then remembers it as telling me... Like MAN if you had TOLD ME that we were having company, I'd be nervous and thus I would remember you telling me.  Do not tell me you told me.  You told your damn mother again!  Of course what I really say is "I would appreciate it if you could try telling me a few times :)" 




 Three times a day or so, I will say something to my husband and he will act like he didn't hear me.  Like he'll be obviously looking for something, and I'll say to him "What are you looking for, baby?" and he'll just not answer, not look at me, and then leave the room on a search for something that is probably exactly where I think it is.   He also does this when I ask him to turn down the volume in the car.  I swear to god, I am NOT a mumbler.  He's just being an ass.  




 Older doesn't mean smarter or more driven or really more anything.  I absolutely hate that your age doesn't actually equate to brilliance.  I think this would be a lot easier for me if I had seen it in action prior to age 22.  Like, so let me get this straight... you're 57 and you're working for $7.50 at a call center and this is your whole life?  I don't understand.  You're bumming me out. 




 Probably making sandwiches for my husband.  I like to add all kinds of things that if I told him about he probably wouldn't try the sandwich... so when he inevitably tells me it's the best sandwich he's ever had I'm like :3  




 I was riding with my mom in the car in winter and there was salt on the roads.  She said "It pisses me off that the Indians use all this salt... aren't they supposed to care about the environment?"

I sat there for like two minutes before I managed to say "Mom, for 150 years white people forced them into boarding schools where they erased all traces of their culture.  That's more than one generation.  What are you even talking about?"  She didn't believe me then, but like two years later I proved to her that assimilation is a thing and it happened.  She tells everyone now.  




 I actually prefer them.  I left the following comment on some other post: 

Be awkward and malnourished. I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type. I like 'em hungry looking. 
 




 If you're going vintage, you want to look for something that has been serviced and cleaned and checked for accuracy.  If you're using eBay (which is a great way to find watches), you should check the finished sales on watches with the same movement.  

There are typically three kinds of watches people are looking for: Quartz (meaning battery powered), manual (you wind it), or automatic (it winds itself through the movement of your arms when you walk).  If you're looking for a low profile, you will probably have to sacrifice the convenience of the self-winding automatic.

It's better to go vintage than it is to buy a brand new watch that's a cheap piece of junk... like a Stuhrling.  Yes, it's pretty, but you won't have it long.   

If you really have a timepiece you love, invest in some watch tools so you can change your bands on it.  Get a nice band or a few.  I have a BROS buffalo leather band on my vintage Zenith, and I love it! :) 




 Yes, there are people in the world that have it worse than you, but that doesn't make what you're feeling less real.  It doesn't negate your feelings.

I recently had someone point out that I was being unfair in a discussion because I was failing to acknowledge the validity of one group's plight because the plight of the other group was so much greater.  That was not fair of me and far from sensitive.  I never do this on an individual level, but when it comes to groups and broad generalizations, I have a much harder time.  




 "When you call me close to tell me your body is not beautiful I want my body and my hands to be pools for your looking and laughing. 




 It used to be cerulean, and that's still the answer I'll give automatically, but I think that it's not strictly true.  Colors benefit greatly by having other colors around them.  It's like one of those t-shirt displays at a shop.  You buy one and take it home but it never looks as nice as it did with all its fellows.  




 According to my body-builder friend, you can live healthily a very long time on broccoli and flax-crusted chicken breasts.  I asked him the same question.  




 Where they keep the snoovatars and you get gilded for reasons that are hard to pinpoint... you know... that place.  




 You know... the image-less image board everyone uses....  




 Miracle, kismet, zeitgeist, caveat....  




 Calm down, I'm just remarking surprise since I would have expected you to say something like "I'd be the person who comes to your house and breaks your arms for asking the same question I saw five times yesterday alone."

I'm old, married, and, yes, I have bad taste.  You don't need to tell me you have no interest.  I'm just trying to have fun with you. :( 




 Tumblr's favorite topic is extremely subjective.  It all depends on who you are following.  I could ask the same question but it would look like this: "Why are child-free people who abuse children tumblr's favorite topic?"  or like this: "Why are the politics of black hair tumblr's favorite topic?" 




 You've bothered to give this answer multiple times, you who hates repeat questions.... it's strange.  I have no idea what you look like, but I'm pretty sure no matter how you look, I'd prefer you over Ryan Reynolds.  He gives me the creeps.  




 Was it a LATE NIGHT, Grumbler???? AHAHAHAHAH T_T 




 I'll take it! ;) 




 Omg, you guys.  He's talking about me!  




 Cersei Lannister.... We never got a single clue prior to her narration chapters that she was practically a paranoid schizophrenic whose mania was fixated on Tyrion.  I always got the impression that she didn't like him, but I never thought for one second she was AFRAID of him and imagining him hiding behind every corner.... What the hell?

Edit: Maybe we find out later that someone is poisoning her and she's actually going insane and that's why this was never foreshadowed?
