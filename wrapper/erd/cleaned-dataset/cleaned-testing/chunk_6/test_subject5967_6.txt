 A perfect job for a defensive minded coach. But where to find one of those... 




 Weidman/Silva II  




 Spotify was huge for me. I just make a point to listen to a few new albums each week. I try to mix old artists with newer ones too. r/letstalkmusic has been a great resource too. I try to read a little bit about the artist while I'm listening and that usually leads to their influences, which opens up another opportunity to try new music.  




 How did the principle know whose grades to change?  




 [10] guy probably called it that. 




 When people make fun of you for liking those bands, they don't actually care or think any less of you for it. What they will think less of you for is if you act ashamed. Just own it and people will be cool with it. At work, I'm known as the music buff who sings along to Taylor Swift. Just accept that you like what you like and people will respect that.  




 Curious, can you get mineral oil at any store that has basic skin care products? I've never seen it.  




 Exactly. Javy Lopez was a huge midseason pick up in 2010 too.  




 He disappoints me every off season, but I'm happy in October.  




 And this is the one comment that doesn't have gold... 




 Tl;dr

What's my purpose?


Why am I doing this?


Who am I doing this for? 




 My friend, 22, is getting married next week. Like a chump, I waited until the last minute to get the couple a gift and everything on their registry has already been purchased. What can I give him that will be special? My max is $100. 




 How long does it take to get something tailored? I bought a jacket for a wedding on the 28th and the sleeves are just a little bit  too long.  




 I don't think so. Simple goals like reading 20 minutes a day, listening to new music every week or practicing an instrument every day are easily accomplished with a little discipline and go along way in improving oneself.  




 This isn't a genre or artist I'm familiar with but I've heard so many good things about it, so I gave it a spin today. Can't say I was too impressed. There's a lot going on, but nothing stood out as exceptionally catchy. I might have to listen to it again to make a better judgement.  




 Check out [this transformation]( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bfoi2) by /u/nmp12.  I bet you could pull off something similar.  




 Why doesn't Vivek just coach the team himself? It's obvious he wants compete control anyway. Just cut out the middleman.  




 I really want to hear an explanation from Pete and Vivek. If they have someone like Karl or JVG linned up, then I won't be upset. If this firing is a result of Malone not living up to expectations, then this firing is outrageous. Look at this roster and tell me with a straight face that it's underachieving. Our best player has missed the last 8 games and we're still less than 2 games out of the 8th spot. I don't think there's a Kings fan alive who isn't pleased with the team's performance this year.


If Malone was fired because we weren't playing the ultempo style Vivek wants to see, then Vivek needs to go. It's about winning games, which we were doing for the first time in 8 years. Style counts for nothing.   




 The only way this makes sense is if ownership has been in secret talks with another coach and an agreement was made. Unless a George Karl announcement is made this week, this makes no sense. We haven't made the playoffs in 8 years and right now we're less than 2 games out of the 8th spot with our best player missing the last week and a half. No rational person can call that underperforming.  




 Or, you know, cover it on their TV channel.  




 1. I posted this over 2 hours ago.


2. As of 20 minutes ago, the last time I had the channel on, they were showing a special on dinosaur fossils.  




 Right now they're showing a program on dinosaur fossils.  




 Hostage situation in Sydney. CNN can barely be bothered to mention it.  


Edit: RIP my inbox. I get that it's on their front page now. It wasn't this afternoon when I made this comment. You don't all have to tell me the same thing. 




 They probably don't want the terrorists to be able to see what the police are doing on the outside.  




 Russell Wilson is the quarterback we hoped Kaep would be.  




 Only for 11 months of the year. As for October... 




 I'm surprised LA is willing to deal Kemp within the division. Especially since the Padres are a big bat or two away from being a really scary team.  




 She apologized and claimed her friend was on her Tinder. I laughed it off and then she unmatched me.  




 The conversation always starts at the bottom for me. Maybe it's different on iPhone.  




 I hate people who think they're better than Tinder.  




 I don't think he's boasting, but he clearly doesn't take driving drunk seriously.  









 "Should have had at least a dozen by now, so be it."


Fuck him if he thinks driving while drunk is a joke.  




 Came across her just now. Sacramento?  




 I bought a cheap one. It's so bad I don't even bother using it anymore.  




 It was briefly the name of what's now the Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.  




 At least it's not Power Balance Pavilion. 




 *"Let's force a bunch of businesses to close on the busiest shopping day of the year. That will make people support our cause."* 




 It seems like we have talent at every position, but as a team we're absolute garbage. It's frustrating. 




 You don't need to cycle creatine. Just take 5g a day. 




 Garbage 




 I'm asking my brother for a liter of clean urine. 




 A George Forman Grill, Crock-pot or a rice cooker. 




 This is supposed to be the Manning family, which happens to have 3 NFL quarterbacks in it. Archie, the father is long retired, but Peyton currently plays for the Denver Broncos and is easily one of the top 5 quarterbacks ever. His younger brother, Eli, is good, but nowhere near as good as Peyton. He also has a knack for throwing interceptions, when the opposing team catches his passes. 




 You mean you can't punch a police officer in the face and put your hands on his gun?  




 What is it about protests that make people think they can block off roads? Get out of the street! 




 Michael Brown was an asshole. The looters are assholes.  The arsonists are also assholes. OP never mentioned protesters. 


There are legit cases of systematic racism everyday in America, but this is not one of them. This is a case in which a man assaulted a police officer, tried to grab his gun, and was killed as a consequence of his actions. 




 Looks like protesters were sitting on the car's hood and the driver just punched it to get out of there.


I wish the video started a few seconds earlier.  




 Did you go out and ask them? According to CNN, the majority of the 61 arrests last night were Ferguson residents. 




 He's certainly popular, but I don't think he will be able to make it out of the primaries. 




 This morning, I heard talking heads on CNN blame everyone BUT the people of Ferguson for the riots. It takes a special kind of mental gymnastics to watch people burn their own city and then blame the police, outside agitators, the prosecutor, etc... 




 This is so irresponsible. Someone needs to be fired for this. 




 My work sells cheesecake. The last two nights I ate a slice at 520 calories a piece. I'm curious how bad it would be if 520 of my 3000 daily calories came from cheesecake if I did that everyday...hypothetically of course. 




 Hopefully he's able to play 3B for the rest of his career, because Sox fans won't be happy with having a DH who can't hit more than 15 home runs and .280. 




 Look what those racist cops made him say! 




 Freaking Jake Tapper always trying to protect female reporters. Let them do their job and trust their judgement to keep themselves safe. 




 It's justified because he assaulted a cop and tried to grab his gun. 




 Yet you're still watching... 




 Police should go home and let these people burn their city down. This is disgraceful! 




 It's the punching a police officer and reaching for his gun that did it. 




 And tomorrow they will blame police. 




 Word is that an announcement of indictment cannot be made unless the suspect is in custody. Darren Wilson has not been asked to turn himself in and an announcement is scheduled for about 10 minutes from now, so it can deduced that there will be no indictment. 




 This is going to be a shit show. 




 There will be no indictment, Ferguson will riot, protesters will blame police. Count on it! 




 Seriously! I don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea.  




 Well, what's the answer? 




 I'm nervous about our rotation. In the playoffs, MadBum was dominant, but everyone else struggled. A healthy Cain will help, but who knows what he will be capable of. Adding another reliable starter will be huge.  




 I'm gonna miss Pablo, but the reality of it is that he is a .280 hitter who has surprisingly little power for a man his size. As much as I like him, I don't think he's worth $100 million. If this means we get Lester, I think we come out ahead. 




 Supposedly Posey wants to catch. 




 We have $100 million to spend on free agents now, which can only mean Matt Duffy and Joaquin Arias will platoon 3B next year.  




 The guy didn't owe us anything. Boston is a great city with a good team. Let's just be happy for the good years we had with Pablo and even happier that we didn't overpay for him. 




 I'm sad to see Panda go, but glad we didn't shell out $100 million for him. If this means we can sign either Tomas, Lester or Headly, I think we're better off.  




 This is my biggest complaint about MFA, which is still one of my favorite subreddits. I see students asking for advice all the time and it never fails that people suggest the stereotypical MFA uniform. While an OCBD, dark cuffed denim and Allen Edmonds look nice, they're way out of place on a college campus, let alone high school. 


Someone once told me to dress 10% better than the average guy. That way, you look better, but don't stick out like a sore thumb. Given that I went to a university in southern California where the average guy wore a tank top, basketball shorts and flip flops, that wasn't hard. 


To me, dressing well is a combination of looking nice without looking out of place. There's a time and a place for the MFA uniform, but 11th grade isn't it. To be fair, it seems like this is less of an issue now than it was a year ago, but it's a beef I've always had with MFA. 


Sorry for the anti-MFA-circlejerk-circlejerk. 




 If they rejected everyone who had tried pot, there would be no military. 




 Noah and Gibson each with 5 fouls. We have to attack the paint. 




 Just reread Hatchet as a 22 year old. Still as good as I remember. 




 If you consme more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. If you consume more calories than you burn and don't exercise, you will gain fat.  




 *"I wonder if I'll be able to recognize Joe Torre as a k--there he is."* 




 So, he left his insurance info and a phone number with no area code, which could easily be figured out, and he wrote it on a whatever piece of paper he had on him, which happened to have a Bible verse on it? How exactly does this make him a scumbag?  




 The best one I've made is buffalo chicken. I cook about 1.5 pounds of chicken covered in a bottle of buffalo sauce and dry ranch dressing mix on low for 7-8 hours. Then I just shred it and eat it on a sandwich roll, usually with some broccoli on the side and milk to drink. It's delicious. 

I'm all about simplicity, so if a recipe has more than about 3 ingredients, I probably won't try it. Sometimes I'll just cook chicken breasts in water, shred them, and then mix it with brown rice. Chicken can also be slow cooked in beer, which gives it a different flavor. Check out /r/slowcooking for more recipes. They're a little more adventurous than me.  




 For the most part. I bought a slow cooker and I cook a ton of chicken in that. I also cook a lot of rice. If I cook 2 cups of rice and 1.5 pounds of chicken, I can get about 3 meals out of that, which I refrigerate and eat over 2-3 days. 

I also make breakfast burritos with eggs, hash browns and sausage. They're delicious, inexpensive and if I eat 2 of them and a glass of milk in one sitting, it's over 1000 calories. I only make about 8 at a time with 10 eggs, but I've seen guys prepare them by the dozen using 40+ eggs. Just wrap them in a paper towel and put them in Tupperware.  




 Are you preparing meals in advance? When you go to bed at night, you should know where your calories for the next day are coming from. If you're waking up and scavenging for 3000+ calories every day, you won't be able to sustain. 




 Nice progress. I love short term progress pics. It makes the future a little less daunting. 




 Comcast customer support keeps friendzoning me.  




 M'Netflix  




 I'd rather see this picture without Photoshop. I guess I'm unique like that :-) 




 Has there been a better linebacker in football the last 3 weeks than Chris Borland? 




 49er fans complaining after every call/no-call... 




  To motivate myself to eat enough protein, I would force myself to eat my own semen on days when I didn't get 120g by bedtime.


Gotta get those sperm gains. 




 Man, what I wouldn't do to discover AC/DC for the first time again... 




 They were playing a bar in my neighborhood a few months ago. I drank so much during the opening acts that my friend and I just decided to leave early. Regrets... 




 Ever since I started paying for Spotify, I've been listening to full albums while I lift. It's like killing two birds with one stone since otherwise I would just sit on my ass in my room and listen. I've been going through the White Stripes' catalogue recently. I think their self titled album and White Blood Cells are my favorite to lift to. 


If you like Hash Pipe, give their album Pinkerton a listen. It's my favorite Weezer album. I also keep going back to a band called Battleme. They're just the right pace for me to lift to. 


I also made [this playlist]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7) of movie scores a while ago. It's good for when you want to feel like Batman while you lift. 




 9 players, 8 uniforms. 




 I highly recommended *All the Shah's Men*. It's perfect for someone who doesn't typically read history. It reads like a thriller, it's short enough that it doesn't get bogged down with minor details and it helps explain the way the world works today.  




 A hockey team will be, like the Kings were, nothing more than a toy for the Maloofs. They'll be excited at first, but then they will lose interest and neglect it. I wouldn't trust this family to own a pet, let alone a sports franchise.  




 A gentleman he is not.  




 Brother, if you ever break your arms, you better move out immediately.  




 Where do you usually go out? I'm almost always willing to go out, but I live in Auburn, so Sac is a little far for me to go regularly.  




 Yes. Part of the appeal of lifting is that it's something I can do alone that is still productive. It's not that I don't enjoy being social. It's just that it takes a lot out of me and I need to recharge. Lifting is something I can do to get my necessary alone time yet be productive, as opposed to watching Netflix.  




 If there's one positive from this season, it's that it looks like we have another stud linebacker.  




 I'm tentatively planning on being in downtown Roseville around 9:30. Probably at a place called the Opera House Saloon, but there are a few other bars in that area we can check out too.  




 You sound like the right guy to know. Are you over 21? We should hit some bars together. 




 I'm not set on a particular place. In the past I've had the most fun at the Opera House, but I'm open to going anywhere. Thinking 9:30-10ish.  




 My dad has fond memories of this Mac and cheese, but the recipe was never written down. I asked grandma, who now has a very poor memory, but she couldn't give me any exact measurements ("a whole gob of cheese", "a splash of milk", etc.). I did my best to recreate the recipe based on what she told me and it turned out pretty darn good.


Boil 2 cups of macaroni in salted water (grandma insisted that the water be salted)


In a baking dish, mix macaroni with approx. 1 cup of cheese. I used sharp cheddar.


Add 1/2 cup of milk

Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, stir, then bake for 10 more minutes. 




 I want those black Adidas Soccer pants, but they're so expensive. Is there an off brand alternative? 




 Dibs on Scat Shadow for a band name. 




 I made a friend from Espoo while at school in San Diego, CA!  




 If my math is correct, it's about 1300 calories. 150 calories per 4 oz of chicken plus I put it on roles that are 130 calories each. I got 3 sandwiches from this batch of 1.6 pounds. I don't know about protein. 


I've seen other recipes that include butter or even cream cheese. That would add some calories if you're desperate.
