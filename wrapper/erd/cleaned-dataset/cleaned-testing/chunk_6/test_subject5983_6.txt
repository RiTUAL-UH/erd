 Why the hair? 




 What's your best memory of filming UHF? 




 Exactly my thoughts. I was so confused why people were so obsessed with it. It felt like an overly long YouTube action short. 




 * Dredd sucks.
* 22 Jump Street sucks.
* The Dark Knight is the most overrated movie of all time, but it doesn't suck. 




 Desh. All the people that are sent to kill him are the CIA's "assets". 




 Don't let the people fool you: Brothers sucks. I'm too lazy to explain why here but it does. The Hurt Locker does a brief but good job of shoving the *life after war* thing in your face; regardless, its still a great watch. 

[The Messenger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790712/), with Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson, is great. Check it out. 




 MMW: No they won't. 




 The Guard is great. I'm getting ready to see Calvary now. 




 In Bruges or the entire Cornetto Trilogy 




 Asylum and then City. Unless you finish up quick and can't wait for Knight, I say don't play Origins. It adds literally nothing. The story isn't half as good as the previous two, and gameplay is not nearly as fluid and is full of infuriating glitches and bugs that devs refused to fix.

People will disagree but honestly it was a really upsetting release for me, seeing as I 100% the first two (which I've never *wanted* to do in a game before). I didn't have 1/50th of the fun playing Origins that I had during Asylum and City. 




 [Ooh La La - The Faces - From Rushmore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--HaFAtC17U) 




 Neat. 




 It's pretty great entertainment. It's just a guy with a camera following a different cop/set of cops per episode, hence the title. Its been on for like 30 seasons. 




 That was surprisingly good directing. That oner in the hallway that ended with Blue Eyes silhouette behind Malcolm was great.  




 I have checked out their other stuff. He is awkward. That's not my problem. A main component of his job is to not be awkward. Get over *your*self. 




 Theres still time! Reboot with Donald Glover! 




 Damn hipsters. 




 Good one. I forgot about him. 




 Not my favorite, but definitely the best of recent: Koba from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. 

The "human work" scene with his scars shows the emotion behind his hatred for humans, and the scene where he [SPOILERS](#s "goes from goofy monkey to killer ape at the weapons cache and throws Ash off the balcony") are two of the most intimidating and villainous actions I've seen in a while. 




 Watching House I always surprise myself remembering Hugh Laurie is British. Who else has a flawless accent?

That's the first Google result for "David Fincher Alien 3 Problems". I didn't bother reading it but I'm guessing it covers it. Basically Fincher had little to no control over the film and was constantly arguing back and forth with the studio. He has publicly criticized the final result in the past. 




 You've named most of them. Fincher hasn't ever made a bad film (not counting Alien^3) and so far Denis Villeneuve is 3/3, all of which are excellent. 




 Fassbender and Phoenix. 




 Titus Welliver has never not played a cop. 

DJ Qualls gets typecast as the guy whose name end with "-y" or "-ie".

Seth Rogen is typecast as Seth Rogen. 




 I love the movie and the documentary. I was wondering why people were downvoting you. 




 Original. Then Redux. 




 DOES IT HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA?

edit: I didn't mean to do that in all caps but I'm happy with how it turned out 




 It fades with overexposure. When I found out about ASMR I listened to several videos a day. After a few months I stopped getting tingles unless I heard something new, since I jumped on the bandwagon pretty early on.

Since then I took a break for a few weeks and am now back to experiencing tingles just as powerfully as I used to.  




 *Spiders Are About The Mass Of Cow 




 In response to all of your replies in this thread: just fucking google it. 




 I love how into it he is. 




 Shut down? No. Better regulated? Yes. 




 I figured they were messin about.  




 Falling Down 




 I opened the video while I was doing something else and didn't notice it wasn't soccer until 3 minutes in. Fucking hilarious. 




 The host of this show sucks. 




 He may be the best villain I've seen in a movie since the Joker. Especially during that scene where he takes the gun from the weapons tester after using his goofy disguise. 




 I didn't see the first one. I was fine. 




 Dat tracking shot with Malcolm running through the building ending with Blue Eyes in the background tho 




 It also made me realize that Jason Clarke could make a damn good Joel. 




 I've seen Secretary. I'm not going to sit here and lie to myself. 




 Someone's mad. 




 The Grand Budapest Hotel museum scene was incredible. And hilarious. 




 equals crazy delicious. 




 I saw them filming this in Venice beach almost two years ago. 




 I don't know much about Miles Davis or this movie, but I sure as shit love Don Cheadle. I'll see it. 




 The one on the right looks like a young Chevy Chase.  




 Birdman. 




 There Will Be Blood... 




 Lecrae performed at my elementary school when I was in 5th grade. We jammed out to Jesus Muzik. 




 Does Prismacolor just make the best everything? I've never used anything made by them. 




 It's exciting that he finally confessed that sometime in the future we will be seeing the preview for the preview for the movie. 




 Is that Joel Edgerton in picture 5? I think that is Joel Edgerton in picture 5. 

Anyway, for some reason I think this movie will end up being pretty mediocre regardless of some great performances. Calling it now. 




 Oh yeah. 




 He's done a couple of short films in the past and some other writing work but I think that's it as a director. Really talented guy though, from what I've seen. 




 I didn't read on as I just bought the movie yesterday and haven't watched it yet, but if you're looking for another family drama using crime as a plot device, check out Animal Kingdom by David Michod. I watched that a week or two ago and loved it. 




 Perfect Day fits in the OD Scene of Trainspotting, well, perfectly. 




 Well that's not exactly fair as the song was written for the movie. 




 ...why, though? 




 That's it! I thought it was a Bruce Willis movie. Thanks. 




 Recently, either the scene where the driver/boyfriend guy talks about his Red Bull sponsorship or the scene where Wahlberg drinks a Bud Light in Transformers: Age of Extinction. Product placement so blatant that it was hilarious. 




 Thanks a lot. This doesn't sound too bad, and I love Denis Villenevue and Jake Gyllenhaal enough to tough it out. 




 **Animal Kingdom** by David Michod

An incredible Australian crime-drama. Well written and directed with some great performances and an intense story. Can't wait for The Rover, Michod's next film. 




 I'm incredibly arachnophobic. I tried starting it a few weeks ago but immediately had to turn it off. How prevalent are spiders throughout the movie? 




 Walt should have a red line to Hector and/or Gus, technically. 




 I wouldn't say True Detective is Harrelson's pinnacle. Did you ever see Rampart?

(Sorry.) 









 Pretty? 




 Zoolander? 




 It does suck that all the gay Hispanics have an easier time getting into colleges.  




 I fucking love Chance and this drawing is amazing (especially the hair), but those pupils are freaking me out 




 Can someone link to me to the album instead if this picture of Adele flipping the bird? 




 The Rocker with Rainn Wilson? 




 Mary and Max, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, and Blue Valentine.  




 Zodiac caused the actual case to reopen. 




 And dat yoga.  




 Black twitter. It's a whole other world.

(Also I x-posted it to /r/WTF and apparently the guy next to Kanye also did the Graduation cover, and this weird shit is supposed to be a satirical statement on Japanese media. Still tho.)  




 Well that's pretty cool. I love the Graduation artwork.
Still, without context, ....what the fuck?

Here is Kanye West with the cum spiral statue. 




 Fuckin' white phosphorous, man.
