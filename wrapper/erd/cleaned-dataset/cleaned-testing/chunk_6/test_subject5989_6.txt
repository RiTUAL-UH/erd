 This would be my daily driver, I'd still want to do a bunch of mods to push the HP over 300 for sure. Track every once in a while for fun perhaps but definitely not serious tracking or autox. 




 Yeah I feel you on this, I do love that god awful wing on the STi though so I would be sad not having one lol 




 STi is more expensive, although the WRX isn't an STi I think things like leather and push to start would be cool to have. Not to mention with the money saved I could still go crazy with all the cobb parts I want lol. Thanks for the input 




 Where can you find cool car themed rearview items like that? I've always been looking! Lol 




 I've been deciding on colours also, heavily leaning towards DGM. Looks amazing in person and is the best colour for always looking clean :) 




 Why can't desperate and single girls like this call my phone?  




 Congrats, inspirational transformation! 




 You gotta be kitten me! This is so damn cute :D 




 ohh alright, Infiniti is nice but for the price I'd much rather drive a BMW 




 I always thought that was RWD but I could be wrong.
