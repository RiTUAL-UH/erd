 Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Seems to be working better now :)

 Anyone know why when I drag an army to a city, it opens the city screen rather than move my troops? I have to drag them like 3-4 times before it works 




 Context is everything 




 You don't really believe that do you? 




 dude, uncool 




 Fixed. Sorry, not a native speaker. 




 It's a joke, you twat. 




 I always thought the "you shall have no other gods before me" was borderline crazy girlfriend territory where she doesn't want you having any other female friends. Like, why can't I worship the christian God, have a bit of Allah on the side to cover my bases and then throw in a dash of Vishnu or some pagan deities just for the bant. 




 Well maybe you shouldn't be living here 




 Fuck me?! FUCK YOU! 




 What's wrong with chipped nail polish?  




 He's really nervous around girls when he's sober 




 I'm deaf in one ear so no thank you 




 Thank you so much! 




 Too long for you?

Edit: nobody understands good humour

 Don't!

 No way, dude. That recruit has had enough of that shit at school, he doesn't need it at the army. Fuck up, Drill Sergeant.

DOWNVOTING MEEEEEEEEEE?? 




 Fucking hell 




 Well the caller said he can't die so maybe she thought he was immortal or some shit and didn't worry too much about being quick? 




 Haha, I clicked a random point in the video you linked and instantly hear Rythian whining about something 




 He didn't 




 :/ 




 Work hard, play hard 




 You sound like an anime character. Stop fooling yourself. 




  That's original.

Thank you!

 Gasoline evaporates extremely quickly, which quickly creates a volatile mix. It doesn't help that it's heavier than most atmosphere, so it tends to collect in pools instead of dissipating quickly.

Same!

 I know plenty, and know how to practically apply it, and I apply that knowledge in my every day life.

Are you a firefighter?

 You're the type of person that gets people killed, by not being prepared to handle situations as they come. Many situations won't be about your choice or what you did.

Yeah, so not my problem. 

 Say a car is on fire, and you need to decide how you're going to save a person out of it, will you be prepared to act?

Again, not my problem.

 I have no faith in you except sheer blind luck.

wtf wie ben jij man ?
wtf don't even know you stfu

 Well, my philosophy is growing innit. That's what debate is for.

And I'd consider news organisations integral to society, so BAM you get a car. 




 Cameraman for what sort of organisation? And yes, I'd say the majority of people need cars currently... but a lot are just lazy, you don't need to drive EVERYWHERE. 




 I am not a troll. I just don't censor my opinions. Think of it more as an experiment. How many redditors do you think trim down their comments to ensure they get positive karma? I'd say the majority. 




 I'd allow public transport in my world vision, but not that scabby gross public transport we have today. And I'd have security stationed on each bus or train or likes to deal with rabble rousers.

I'd allow access to cars for emergency service members, and government officials. And people with disabilities, such as wheelchair users (or I'd invent some wheelchair highway they can speed down). Everyone else must walk or cycle, or use the premium public transport. 




 yes it does dude 




 Anal jokes are banal jokes. 




 Ya got legs, use 'em 




 wtf bro? 




 woo more minecraft /s

Edit: i take it back, this was actually a great video 




 Car drivers are always so angry - you're destroying the environment, you don't get a right to be so mad. 




 Funhaus 




 I got gilded. The people have spoken. My word is law. 




 Cool! Would you like to show which pieces of dialogue were your favourite by quoting them, thus contributing to the conversation? 




 NECKBEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD 




 He's not wrong... 




 ... but, it's a men's profession...? Did she even read the tweet? 




 Wait, what? 




 Days and months is a man made concept. 




 Come again? 




 Re-read my comments? 




 Lmao, yes. 




 That's completely different, that is a monetary value. It is physical. Time is relevant.  




 Waiting for a friend when they are LATE, when I don't have any sense of TIME, and when I having nothing to DO. That's what I'm saying. Psychologically it is torturous. 




 Situation A (waiting on friend), you'd agree that is kind of torturous?

Situation B (trapped in car), that's like Situation B EXEMPLIFIED. I'd argue they are comparable in the sense that psychologically they are both strenuous.  




 You ever been waiting on a friend and they don't show for AGES, and you have no watch to check, no phone to pass the time? And it feels like time is going really slowly? That's probably what this guy was feeling, so I think saying he survived 2 months is completely fine. 




 It's closer to 1 month, yeah, but it may as well be 2 months. The poor guy was trapped in a car, fuck sakes, give him the benefit of the doubt. 




 43 days is roughly 2 months, stop being a pedant.  




 Not trolling, I just believe in a world where we all should respect each other. Thanks, though. 




 He put the time and effort into delivering this content upon us. You don't downvote OP in his own goddamn thread. 




 To be fair, /u/NuclearWookie came in to this post and insulted our OP. Show a bit of respect to the creator of this thread. 




 That's low 




 but not for me???? 




 haha 




 I would but it is fucking impossible to get Exalted without dying of boredom. 




 This isn't cringe.

 Upvoting you for having the gallbladder to reply to yourself.
