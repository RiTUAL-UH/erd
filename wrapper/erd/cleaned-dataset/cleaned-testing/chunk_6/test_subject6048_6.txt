 Is villar available? 




 It's a fair trade, and you clearly don't need Grilli. That being said in a 10 man you could probably do better than peralta at SS. Who's available on waivers? 




 I like Hutchinson the most out of those. 




 Apologies for the probably confusing title. I'm referring specifically to Windstream Holdings(WIN). This stock was stead around the $8-$10 range for the past 5-6 months or so. I bought 6 shares of it at $8.60. Recently they spun off part of themselves to create a new company, CSAL. For every 5 shares of WIN, shareholders were given 1 share of CSAL. Now my concern is when I look at the WIN historical data it essentially has what the actual price per share was multiplied by 5. Is this normal practice? It seems like a completely dishonest display of historical data. The day I purchased by $8.60 shares it has the price listed at ~$49.

I'm new to this so again, apologies for the lack of terminology that probably led to a poor explanation. 




 Def solid, I just think he's been kinda overhyped this preseason. 




 New to investing, don't have a lot of money to play around with. Unable to purchase penny stocks using my online broker. That being said, a lot of this sub preaches avoiding them, interested in reasons why I shouldn't get involved.

The community in this sub is outstanding. I learn so much just by reading through comment threads- rock on. 




 It's a bad trade, but if you veto it you're a giant pussy. 




 3/10 




 Stop whining and deal with it, there's good arguments for both sides. Why should he be penalized for winning? Managing injuries is part of the game. And honestly if you're in a league where people are dropping Ryan Braun you have much bigger problems than the waiver format. 




 Definitely Duffy 




 Might want to set him up with a social worker afterwards, rape can be pretty traumatizing. 




 I like it 




 Yeah go for it, he could throw a gem tonight and is pretty much a lock for getting you a bunch of Ks 




 Awesome stuff, would love to read this on the reg. 




 It's a steal for you. Richards is an easily replaceable pitcher and Wong could finish top 5 at his position this year. 




 Oh hell yeah. That's a big win for you. He agreed to that? 




 I'd start him, good chance alcides dosnt play today. 




 SS and 3B is weak. After Sale your SP is pretty bad. Aside from those categories I think your team looks awesome. Pretty lame about the no trades, you have a lot of depth at  2B that you could probably leverage to improve elsewhere. 6/10 




 Not sure who you could get for him...def worth trading if you can get a steal. 




 The situation hasn't changed. If you're in a daily league he's totally worth rostering. As the season progresses and guys in this dodgers lineup start getting more injured and need more rest he'll get more at bats and become more valuable in weekly leagues. Just be patient. It's a unique situation he's in, unless your bench is filled with studs I'd say it's worth it. 




 Many thanks 




 Anyone watching know why Hughes was pulled? 




 No that's horrible. Alcantara is the definition of replaceable your basically giving a top pitching talent to move up 2 draft spots. 




 Billy butler 




 Thanks so much for your comprehensive response, some great ideas here. Think I will start checking out some movies that do this to help with the brainstorming, and will definitely experiment sandwiching the still shots in between motion. 




 Thanks for your reply! Any chance you could elaborate on this? Honestly not sure what any of it means. 




 I'm employing this strategy and am 2nd in Ks in my league. Have a few SPs that a rotate in that supplement this stat though. 









 Currently doing it and am 3-0. Keep in mind when one of your RPs blows it, which will happen, it's going to hurt you quite a bit. Good to anchor the staff down with a few reliable SPs. Even though you'll be punting wins you'll be winning saves every week. 




 Awesome! Thank you for this. 




 I'm a complete noob. Apologies if this is the wrong sub to post this or if I didn't articulate it well enough. Been filming around a city using a tripod, aside from fast moving clouds, a passing bird, or flags waving in the wind I'm at a loss for ideas. (Not interested in time-lapse for this in particular).

Thanks! 




 Good man 




 Fuck yeah 




 Even better. Honestly those guys are marginally very replaceable whereas Salvador could very likely finish the season as a top 5 catcher. 




 Dude take that, easily worth it 









 If it's espn I'd put guerrero in the slot 




 Who's available on ww? 




 I wouldn't have him on my team in a 10 man league 




 Definitely a tough call on this one. I'd probably stick with cueto and walker. 




 Avoid Young. He'll get you some home runs but he's going to platoon for the yanks. When not hitting at home his splits will be even worse. Keep in mind as the season goes on this aging yankees lineup is going to start getting tired and injured and he'll get even less protection. We're talking about a career .230 hitter it is literally a guarantee that he fades.

-yanks fan 




 Awesome write up! 




 I'd easily drop Trumbo for him. 




 Ahh my b 




 In espn/yahoo he has it from last year 




 Yeah I'd say Russell is probably the best bet out of the bunch. I'm not as high as other people are on him. Might be worth seeing the solid ss/2b that are struggling and try to buy low on one in a trade. If you're in an espn/yahoo league, Alex Guerrero has 2B eligibility and I think he's worth starting despite his limited at bats(the moment someone get injured in that lineup, and someone will, they'll work him into it every day)

 




 Who else is available? 




 Any time you start a pitcher at Coors field you're taking on a big risk. His guy isn't an ace, someone I would keep on the bench tonight. 




 Take the risk and start him. Yanks just held them to 1 run they ain't that hot. 




 No chance would I start Heston at Colorado. Definitely start Salazar against Detroit. 




 Yeah this can be a very immature/frustrating community when it comes to dissenting opinions. People need to realize the philosophy in here is about constructive discussion, not just arguing. That being said, I've been checking this sub out almost every day since the season started. Would definitely recommend Fangraphs and Razzball if you don't already frequent them, content and the comments sections foster some pretty great material. 




 Great write up! Love country breakfast. Assuming he sustains this kind of productivity, could be worth trading away a top 1st baseman for another elite piece and put butler in the spot.  




 Dude it's April.  




 Wow, compelling mock up, I wasn't convinced until I saw this post. Well done! No idea papelbon/Perkins had that many 




 All fair points. Though your mistaking Mejia for Familia. Familia didn't get suspended, and mets management has committed to him for when Parnell returns. 




 Kinda depends who you're targeting. Familia on the mets is a WW guy, albeit by an injury. Fernando Rodney went fairly late in my drafts, along with Santiago Casilla. Ottavino in particular is a guy that terrifies me since pitching at Coors field is like being on the moon.

Def agree with you in regards to guys like kimbrel, Jansen and rosenthal that we see being taken mad early . 




 Good point. Personally when I'm putting closers on my team I try to maximize that opportunity. 40 saves is a big difference over 25 in the course of a season. 




 Holy shit who are these owners you're playing with? Easily pick up Gio and iwakuma 




 Trade him, rays aren't going to be in many save situations this year 




 Who else is available? All of those guys are solid. I'd probably order them CarrascoKeuchelArchie, though Archie having the highest ceiling. 




 Buy buy buy 




 Gotta give us some more to go on homie. Roster, who's available, scoring system, etc 




 Agree that it's an optimistic projection, but he definitely has the power. In 2013 he hit 11 HR in 150 at bats, you do the math. 




 Honestly I think you're fine streaming any of those guys for the next 6 weeks.
