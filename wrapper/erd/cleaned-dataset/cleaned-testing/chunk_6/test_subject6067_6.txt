 Exfoliation + moisturizing my upper arms have helped.  I make solid scrub bars to use but I'm sure a good loofah would work.  Some people say dry brushing helps too. 




 You're crazy!  This sounds delicious :D 




 Beautiful, but I can't imagine having to clean the little crevices if something spills.  So much work to maintain.. lol
 




 I like #1 the best :D 




 Talisman!  The longest session we've ever played was 8 hours straight.  Damn you hag!! 




 I love playing this on my iPhone and iPad!  Most expensive app I've ever purchased ($10) but so worth it :D 




 Just watched Oculus.  Gotta take out the mirrors out of our house.   




 Sixth Sense and the first Insidious were both really scary to me, but Thailand's Shutter was freakkyyyy.  Actually Hong Kong's The Eye 2 was frightening.  That hospital elevator scene still haunts me.  




 Love it! Now you're like an anime character :D 




 Hi it's Jen

The streets of the French Quarter at night
http://www.test_subject6067.com/2014/04/07/the-streets-of-the-french-quarter-at-night/

This is my personal travel photo blog with a few recipes and pictures of my other hobbies sprinkled in.  Would love to get an idea of what you guys think about my photos and description of our New Orleans trip :D  Thank you!

*edited to change the blog link to a specific blog posting.
 




 A half up pompadour style with medium barrel curls?  




 I honestly have never heard of that term lol.  The things I learn while reading reddit posts hahahah. 




 I'm just going to ask, what's a bussy? 




 I love your hair!  You look beautiful :D 




 Everything else sounded ok until the peanut butter.  Why the peanut butter?? whyyyyy?   




 Our whippet only grabs things when they've already hit the floor :(  lol 




 Lucy thinks that she's a cat! 




 For me it's microwaved flax seed bread, stevia, obsessed with all the true lemon products, and cauliflower rice :D 




 Omg this is my blog!  Glad you love the bread too.  I eat it all the time and it makes me feel like I'm having real bread.  Ty for checking it out :D 




 I've actually worked as a photographer/retoucher for many years and trust me...lots and lots of retouching goes into every photo.  Lots :/ 




 I've never been more entertained and grossed out by a single comment.  Congratulations :D 




 Oh my that "soup" has such translucent quality to it... *throws up 




 That looks pretty good!  Great job. 




 I don't use any sauce.  Maybe that's the key! 




 I do that all of the time!  Cringeeeeee.... 




 Freshly sliced cucumbers and watermelon.  It's even better if they're nice and cold. 




 I have a pretty sensitive stomach, but Taco Bell never makes me sick...  




 I felt like my arteries were getting clogged by looking at the photos.   




 omg.. lol I'm so silly.  I did have a duplicate category and tag :D  TY so much guys! 




 Hi guys, I have a category slug that has a -2 but there isn't another category with a duplicate name.  Can anyone tell me how to change it?  Thank you! 




 I really like mine.  I've had it for over a month now.  No rash so far!  I think I'm going to keep mine but I am worried about the recall window as well... 




 Hi guys!  I'm looking to purchase one of those tv programming boxes for my parents so they could watch more chinese shows.  I've looked at Suntv, TvPad 2 and 3, and wasn't sure which ones you guys would recommend.  I don't live with them but they do have cable internet so I figured one of these boxes would be great.  Any input would be appreciated :D   




 Lol! 




 the " woe is me look "  




 My dog and cat would both just die of happiness :D 




 Reddit is really starting to make me think that incest is really common... o_O 




 It seems like Howard always gets bummed out about Artie since the show was sort of blamed for his suicide attempt.  I agree that the crowd would have loved it.  I just think that Artie showing up or making a video would end up being more about Artie and overshadow the other stuff that ended up happening.   




 He hasn't been back on the show since the suicide attempt, so I think a more serious setting would have been more appropriate.  I'm sure he sent his birthday wishes to Howard privately. 




 I'm glad that he wasn't at the show.  IMO it would have made the vibe of the event slightly uncomfortable. 




 Thank you for the link to your review.  I will check it out :D
 




 I have a tanita scale too that I really liked.  But it recently died... :(
