 Freaking out for you bro. Idk why, but this has me very hot and sweaty 




 Yeah, crazy isn't it? 




 So my girlfriend and I just had sex and the condom broke during it and I came inside of her. She is on birth control and has been for 3 weeks (3rd week just started) and was previously on a different birth control pill for 2 months. We both lost our virginity to each other about a month ago and have already got plan B twice. Should we be worried about her getting pregnant? We are both 21 and in college and do not want a kid or kids at the moment. Thanks for any input. I'm not too worried about it, but she seems a bit shooken up. 




 I know this is a joke, but in my experience a movie is the perfect first date. If the two of you become the couple everyone hates in the theatre because you're talking the whole time, it's a solid sign you guys will work out.  




 Alec Baldwin in 30 Rock. 




 Damn it that almost made me start crying in the library at my school. I had to stop watching with like a minute left.  









 I used to feel this way about it, but I've really started to come around to it and admire looking up at it.  




 Whatever is Spanish for Remember Your Mother 




 It's getting chilly and my stomach wants some pizza. It could warm me up. Thanks. 




 :( 




 Manchester United because they were the first soccer team I ever heard of.
Borussia Dortmund because Reus is my favorite player. 
Bordeaux because I like using them in fifa career mode. 
Roma for same reason as above.
Real Madrid because I like what they're doing over there.  




 The last two episodes (I count the last "two" as one) always get me to tear up. Does anyone else suffer from this? It seems a bit ridiculous to cry from a show like this, but it always happens.  




 The only thing you can do is give up. Sounds shitty, but it's all you have left. Don't keep texting her. Cut her off. Maybe she will text you after you don't text her a few days in a row. Happened to me last year with a girl. Things were going great, then the convos got drier. Just stopped texting her.  




 Ain't no party like a Liz lemon party because a Liz lemon party is MANDATORY 




 Yeah, the 30 rock version is actually my favorite song ever right now. I love when Liz says "I've got to go, I've got to go"  




 Yes that's on it too 




 Sadly no :( one of the misses on the album 




 No :( sadly it doesn't have everything  




 Yes! That is so awesome. I'm so happy you have kidney now. I thought it was insane that the official soundtrack didn't have it. Also Liz's 99 Luftballons cover... just fantastic. Thank you! 




 There are 31 total tracks. It has muffin top, Tracy's short version of I will always love you, werewolf bar mitzvah, tennis night in America, Jenna's America song, midnight train to Georgia, the long play of the 30 rock theme, jenna and Danny's Christmas song, the other Christmas song where Colleen and Jack finish it. There are a bunch of smaller jingles in it too.  




 Until recently it never dawned on me that I might be able to buy the songs and background music of 30 Rock. I looked up 30 Rock on iTunes and there it was under albums. $12.99 and totally worth it.   Did anyone else know about this?
I'll warn you all though: you may smile like an idiot when listening to the soundtrack in public.  




 Yes! Honestly this scene makes me so happy and almost emotional whenever I see it. It really shows how everyone in the show really is connected and loves each other in some way.  




 The 76ers are getting there 




 Nice 




 I feel as if this only applies to western society, but regardless I can only speak for western society. They're finding that interior happiness is being replaced by exterior happiness. People have a want for immediate pleasure now such as a high from a drug instead of prolonged pleasure such as success from something you worked hard on. People would rather buy the new shoe, new phone or car than they would buy themselves a gardening kit, a guitar or telescope. More things are available to us in this day and age, but unfortunately those things are changing what makes us happy. We need immediate happiness and closure to feel good about ourselves which of course only lasts for a little bit until something new comes out.  




 There are a lot of non mentally challenged people who obsess over one thing in particular as well. I don't think it's only mentally challenged people.  




 There's an app for that. The crossword puzzle anyways.  




 The time I pooped and didn't flush the toilet. My dad asked me what I would do if I saw that he didn't flush and I said I would just flush it. He then said fuck you as loud as he could to me.  




 I felt my stomach turn as I read that.  




 It's working for me! Thank you!  




 Does anyone have a stream where I could watch this online? 




 4-5. Tonight can lead to a 3 way tie for second in my division or tie me in third. Good news in both scenarios I control my destiny. I'll just need to win out. I'm on a 4 game win streak and I've had luck. Maybe my luck will continue.  




 I had a hangover like this once, it actually made me not be able to drink beer for a little less than a year. My body just wouldn't let me drink it. I think it's like taste aversion or something.  




 So after struggling for 3 months because I missed a good amount of work I'm finally caught up on my bills. I would have some money left, but in all of my excitement I got some Christmas gifts for my nephews and I've got just enough to keep myself going until I get paid again. I'm super happy, but also hungry. I would love a celebratory pizza. All I've had to eat the past 2 weeks is pasta and sauce (it's so cheap) and while I still love it, I love pizza more. I live about 10 minutes from a dominos if anyone would like to buy me a pizza. Thank you.  




 I think you have this, bro. 




 I am up 21. I have Cody Parkey. My opponent has McCoy, Maclin and the Eagles D/ST. I'm projected to win by two. I'm worried. A win here will knock my opponent out of a two way tie in second to a potential 3 way tie for second. Likely scenario is he's knocked into a 2 way for third with me. Best case is Darren Sproles and Kelvin Benjamin combine for at least 29 and I keep onto my lead. That will cause the 3 way tie in second.  




 I have Big Ben brown and Bryant and my god that touchdown might have saved my game 




 Stafford has megatron back. Simple enough. Also Mark Sanchez is still him. 




 Wilson. Giants secondary is weak and they like to blitz. Wilson is very good against the blitz if I remember correctly.  




 I'm a believer in Orton, I think he's a much better QB than he is given credit for. I think he will play a good game. 




 Clear your mind and go with Stafford. All you need to know is that Megatron is back! 




 McCown is going against the weaker defense and is a better QB.  




 Go with Cam. I do not like Philly's defense and Cam I think has more potential for high scoring than Joe.
