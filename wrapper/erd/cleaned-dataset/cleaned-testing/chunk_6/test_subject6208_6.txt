 I *literally* just bought this for $25, I'm so jealous.  




 Oh geeze, Inside is so brutal and visceral! 




 Boy Meets World, all 7 seasons. 




 I think it works for some, like the Hulk, due to the comic book look of them, but I think it just doesn't make sense for some others like Bourne and Jurassic Park. The comic book look just doesn't fit the style of some of these.  




 "You're going to go from being a **can**cer...to a **can't**cer!" 




 Shame is easily one of my all time favorites. It's such a fantastic and emotional film. It gets some hate from people who call it pretentious, but I don't get that. Shame tells a different story we don't ever see. It was so raw and showed just how damaging sex addiction can be to ones life. It was the film that made me fall in love with Michael Fassbender. I'll see anything with him now. And Steve McQueen is now 3 for 3. 




 Yeah I personally prefer it to Mud 




 I finished my final paper. It has a title page, an outline and then the paper complete with works cited. My question is a simple question, what order should everything be stapled in? Google doesn't help

 




 "But quick, cause the more successful I get, ^the ^smaller ^my ^range ^becomes!" 




 I'm not a fan of horror movies at all. Mostly because nowadays they're so overly cliche and predictable and full of cheap scares. But I've found a few exceptions. I found 3/4 of The Conjuring great with the last quarter turning into a cliche fest. I also find The Strangers really good even though most people think its bad. Them is probably one of the best horrors I've seen along with the Descent.  









 I also am a huge Parks and Recs fan so I'm really excited to see great things happening for Chris Pratt. 




 I actually am a huge fan of Dexter and it gets quite a bit right for the most part. But just like any show or movie, it does get some wrong. I always enjoyed the scenes where Dexter was in his white room where he tested possible murder weapons on dummies.

The biggest offenders are usually action movies where lots of people get shot. That's where I find the most inaccuracies.  




 I've taken forensics classes at school so now whenever a movie has blood and gore, or lack of it, I automatically start judging the realism of it. I start saying things like "That's too much blood" or "The blood pattern is way off" It doesn't ruin a movie for me, but it's definitely something I notice now.  




 Have you ever met someone named Muhammad?

Edit:*Whoosh*  




 At first I thought she got whiplash and her head snapped back and hit the ground, so I thought brain trauma, but everyone here is saying snapped neck, not head crack. 




 Well, I mean, granted, if the webbing didn't kill her, the fall DEFINITELY would have, so I guess it doesn't matter. But I think the webbing did play a part in at least *how* she died. 




 I'm looking for movies that take place on a cruise ship. Are there any besides Speed 2: Cruise Control? 




 I love movies about vacations for some reason. What are some movies about someone or a group of people going on a vacation? Excluding the National Lampoon movies 









 Saw 30 Seconds to Mars and when Jared Leto came out he said he was really sick. Something to do with his throat. We could tell because he was extremely hoarse while talking, but he said the show must go on. So he ended up barely singing and when he did it sounded really off. I was kind of upset because I think he's a really good singer, but he sounded mediocre that night. However, I do commend him for performing while sick. 




 I think he has the capacity to be a really good actor. The dude *can* act, but he keeps picking bad roles and doesn't make the best choices in life. He was awesome in A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints. I think Shia should retire from acting for like five years. Pull a Joaquin Phoenix and just like disappear from movies and the public life, then out of nowhere, come back with a movie by a great director with a great script. 




 Guess it's not available for pre-order yet :( 









 Despite lyrics, which NIN song is your favorite based purely on the music? (Beats, rhythm, sounds, etc.)

I really love the music in The Way Out is Through and Underneath It All.  




 I'm a big fan of "Without you, without you everything falls apart. Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces." 




 If this is true that's pretty incredible 




 Yes these movies get thrown around a lot in this sub, but for good reason. They're great, and they *do* get an interesting reaction from people who haven't seen them before. Just because they get said a lot doesn't make them any less good. It just makes them popular, and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think the Tree of Life is pretty widely hated. 

Also, all the movies I listed I own. I wasn't picking what reddit likes. I simply walked over to my dvd shelf when I saw this question and picked all the movies I own that have generated an interesting reaction from my friends and family.  









 I wound up seeing Under the Skin even though everyone told me to see Grand Budapest Hotel. I really really liked, maybe even loved Under the Skin. I found it to be so strange yet completely engrossing. I couldn't look away and the music was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The main reason I saw Under the Skin was because this weekend was the last weekend any theater in my town was playing it and Grand Budapest was going to stick around longer. I still plan on seeing it, but I'm glad I saw Under the Skin before it went away.  




 What jobs or careers would give me the opportunity to work at or travel to interesting places? 




 My mother, sister, cousin, and three friends. Mostly because they just don't watch a lot of movies. 




 Children of Men, Crank, Se7en, The Raid, Reservoir Dogs, The Chaser, No Country for Old Men, Napoleon Dynamite, Memento, Moon, The Matrix, Enter the Void, The Tree of Life, Inception and Fight Club. 

These are all movies that I love showing people for the first time because they generate very interesting reactions and discussions.  




 Yeah I totally get that. It's not the best movie, but I think in terms of sci-fi, it's pretty original and executes its concept well without being overly complicated. But I do totally see how someone wouldn't like it. As a sci-fi I think it's good, but as a movie it's not the best.  




 I think it went wide release last week. And was limited the week before. Unless it went even wider release this week. 




 I really loved this movie. Very original and well done. 




 There's this crime one called [Lion and Deer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOl7S5VFYus). Takes place almost entirely in one room. 




 So at work tonight, after we closed, I locked the door then went to do closing duties like I'm supposed to. I then hear the door chimes jiggle quite furiously. I walk to the front and see a woman and two kids. Turns out that the deadbolt was locked but the pegs at the top and bottom weren't so the door kind of pulled open. It was after we closed so I simply told them with a smile that we were closed. She smiled and said, "Oh, sorry." Then left. 

So my manager came out and asked me what happened saying that someone from the offices was mad at me for "kicking" someone out. I told my manager that I simply told her we were closed. I didn't ask her to leave or anything. She left on her own. My manager told me that even so, we can't kick them out. I know you can't kick a customer out if they came in before you closed, but I figured it was different if they came in after the store was closed. 

I then come home and tell my mother what happened and she asked me if they were going to talk to me at work. I told her if they did I wasn't worried because I didn't know any better. We were closed and the registers were in the back. I then jokingly told my mother that the lady technically broke in since we were closed. My mom proceeded to take it way too seriously and started going on about how "You can't tell your managers that!" and "You don't say stuff like that. Take responsibility." We then started arguing. I was telling her that I knew that. It was just a joke. I know I can't tell my supervisors that. She was like, "Well how do I know that." 

What I'm getting at is that my mom always wants me to tell her stuff but when I do she always tries too hard to read between the lines looking for some deeper meaning when there is none. Then she did something I hate. She pity apologized me. She was all like, "Sorry you're right I'm wrong." Just don't apologize at all if you don't mean it because it only makes things worse. 

Then she said for me to drop it, meaning the argument. I can't! I can't leave this argument with me being the bad guy! I'm not wrong! Am I? 




 How would you rank it against Anderson's other films, if you could? 




 I'm going to a movie tomorrow by myself. These two movies are the only ones I have interest in that I haven't seen. I know they are two very different movies, but which should I see? I've heard good things about both. I really enjoy Wes Anderson films, but I also really enjoy some nice cerebral, low-key sci-fi, and I don't mind a slow paced film.

Would I have to be in a certain mood in order to enjoy Under the Skin? What are some other films like it so I can compare it to what I've seen before? 




 Kill List is great but so dark.  




 Ba ba ba, ba ba baran 




 Assuming that he had the same level of intelligence as me and had my memories, I'd make him do things for me because between school and work, I don't have time to do all the things I want/need to do. 




 I'm alright. Could be better. Could be worse. I'm kind of just...jaded. School in the morning and work in the evening everyday. Ready for summer. I'm happier than I've been in the past. I used to be depressed because I wasn't in school, unemployed, and had no love life. Now I'm two thirds there, so I'm feeling better about myself. I'm trying to get in shape so my confidence will build. I'm going to need it to start dating.

I miss my friends. They all work and have school, and are dating or engaged to someone so I'm starting to feel a little lonely.

Good things are happening though. This summer I'm starting work on my first feature film, so I'm really excited about that.

But all in all, I'm alright. A little stressed, but alright. 




 When it's all said and done, will I be happy with how my life turned out? 




 I, as the Rock, would get plastic surgery and make the Rock look like *me*, and legally change his name to *my* name so that I will always be Dwayne Johnson, even if I turn back. 




 Their resilience, physically, emotionally, and mentally.  




 Yeah, probably. 




 I wish girls would more often be the ones =making the first move. I hear all the time from some girls I know that no guy ever approaches them or asks them out. You don't always have to wait on the guy to make the first move.  




 In private I have full conversations with myself, but...I'm not talking *to* myself. I'm talking to some imaginary person. Carrying on full conversations and speaking for both sides. I also pretend I'm talking to an audience sometimes using the word "we" a lot. For example, "We are going to do this, then we will do this." And when I say "we" I'm including myself and the audience I'm talking to. 

I do this often, and have done it for as long as I can remember. As far as I know It's not normal behavior. 




 Free Willy 




 Memphis

Best: People here are usually nice. Worst: This place is a hole. There's nothing interesting here. 




 Besides reddit? I usually binge watch a tv show on netflix. However, I often just put on my headphones, turn on a podcast, then walk around my house eating snacks. 




 Flirting with members of the opposite sex (or same sex). 




 Why do we park on the driveway, but slowly die in the living room? 




 Night. I'm more productive then. Mostly because it's the only time I have to do anything because I go to school and work, so my days are filled. Yeah, I can't really go anywhere at night because things start closing, but I love just laying in bed writing, browsing the internet, watching netflix, or playing games, or just walking aroung my house listening to music and podcasts. 




 My fondest memories and best times have been when it was just me and my three closest friends. There's no stress, no one is being ignored, it's great. 




 Suffering for a day. Get the hard stuff out of the way so you can enjoy life. 




 The ability to be invisible only when no one is looking at you. 




 Those metallic reflectors you put in your car windshield to keep your car from getting hot. 




 It'd be all the symptoms. 




 While I agree, it doesn't matter because the majority of people *do* use IMDB as a reference point to help them decide what's worth watching or not. So even if they get a lot wrong, they have a heavy influence. 




 No Country for Old Men 









 Wow this is fantastic work! She'll love you so much! 




 No the photographer doesn't have any copyright 




 Here's a pic of her: http://imgur.com/IQHYGho

She was wearing a white dress. And the door was a cherry wood color.

Also, here's a colored pic from the same shoot: http://imgur.com/HxJ7c2I 




 The photographer she hired is being super flakey. Not answering her calls, not returning her calls, and the one time she did, the photographer refused to do it because of the "artistic integrity". Help? She needs it done ASAP 









 What youtube channels should I be subscribed to? Big, well-known ones and small obscure ones are all welcomed!  




 I really love Reloaded :( 




 I *just* finished watching season 4 and now I really just want to watch season 5. How can I do this without torrenting? 




 Xbox :( 




 So for months I've been trying to find entertaining things to do in single player(I don't normally play multiplayer because I don't have friends). I guess it could also work in multiplayer. 

Vigilante crime fighter. I mean like a real world super hero. I dress in black, wear a mask, and fight crime! Making sure I don't kill cops or innocents. This gave me hours of enjoyment! It was real fun to break up a crime or killing some gang members, then evading the police without killing them. 

I guess in multiplayer this would be more fun because you could stop and fight actual players which are more interesting than NPCs.  









 Yeah I know all this. Money isn't the issue. It's ease of use that's the problem because, like I said, I know nothing about computers.  




 When I said time consuming, I meant the process of learning everything and finding the right parts. I don't have anyone to help me build a pc that I know of.

How much do high end rigs usually cost? 




 * What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible. 

* Mostly Gaming, not multiplayer but single player on high settings, installing mods. Also maybe video editing as well. 

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $850 

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Towards the end of June 

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Everything? All I have now is a laptop, so no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. 

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* Tennessee, US. Closest Microcenter is like over 5 hours away. 

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* None 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Not sure. Not really planning on it. 

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* None I can think of

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* None. Would be nice if there was a consistent color theme throughout, but not important. Something sleek looking like blacks, greys, and whites? LEDs would be cool, but these are luxuries, not necessary. 

* Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build? 

* Need Windows 7 

* Extra info if required:  I don't know *anything* about computers. 




 Any starting points you recommend? Like you said, "It starts with just learning what everything does" and "Lots of questions, lots of googling, lots of absorbing". This is the stuff I find super intimidating and daunting as someone who knows nothing about computers. 




 Let's say I'm a hardcore gamer who doesn't know anything about computers. Despite whether it's worth it or not, and also as someone who doesn't have as much freetime as he'd like between school and work, how practical and realistic does building a pc seem for me?

I only ask because I don't know what to read, or when I'd have time to read. I also ask because I'd hate to buy all the parts I'd need, only to not have time to put it together.

How long was your pc building process? From finding/ordering the parts to putting it together? 




 Someone mentioned it in this thread and I think they made a good point. It's not the movies themselves I'm getting burned out on. It's the marketing and attention they get that I'm burned out on. Only a few superhero movies get released a year, which is still a lot more than it use to be. But there is a huge over saturation of marketing involved with them. Everyday it's another article, another picture, another clip, another trailer, another commercial, etc.

I don't think there are too many superhero films, but I *do* think there is *way* too much marketing and attention going into them. A lot more than is necessary. It's not just the marketing team either. It's also fans who post all these things as well. They're not in the wrong, but if they would just pull back on that, I think people would get less burned out. Because, again, there are only 3 of these movies a year usually, but we hear about them and see things about them almost everyday. I think *that's* the problem.  




 I know it's probably an obvious answer for most people, but for me it's not so obvious. I want a gaming pc, but I know nothing about computers or how they work. The task of building one seems unbelievably daunting. Even when I know what to get, putting it together and figuring it out seems beyond intimidating. Even if I did manage to put one together somehow, upgrading also seems intimidating. I don't have a lot of time for building one.

The pros of just getting a console is that it's already made. It's simple. The cons? It's less powerful and a smaller library of games.

The pros of building a pc? More powerful, more games and mods. The cons? Very time consuming and there are a lot of ways I could screw it up.

What should I do based off of what I told you about me?
 









 The second one by a long shot. Don't get me wrong, they're both great, but the second one is just incredible. An absolute masterpiece.  




 Yeah I've seen it, but that's why I want the discussion thread. I want to talk about it with other people who have seen it. 




 I really want to discuss this film, but where's the official discussion thread? The movie is now in its wide release. We have the Nymphomaniac discussion up, but not the Raid 2? 




 Speaking of bumping into people renting movies, I remember when I was a kid, my mom and I went to rent movies and bumped into Steven Segal and some chick he was with. He was also apparently renting his own movies, too. I was too young to know who he was. He looked familiar because I had seen his movies, but I didn't really know who he was. My mom, on the other hand, got his autograph. 




 Sorry, didn't mean to sound like a jerk. The question isn't bad, it's just that it has been asked a lot. But it's not just that it has been asked to death, it's also the fact that, honestly, the last thing this sub really needs is more content geared towards super hero movies. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that 70% of things submitted here are superhero related.  




 This post is literally everything that is wrong with this subreddit. 




 I think it should be handled like James Bond. With every Bond movie with a new actor, it doesn't start with Bond's origins. It starts with Bond in the middle of some sort of mission.

I think super hero films should start doing this when they reboot. Start the next superhero reboot with the hero already a hero and in the middle of a mission. In doing this, you save yourself thirty minutes or more you'd have to spend with the origin. 




 Yeah I have a kit lens. I'd like to go wider though. 

As for price, since I'm renting, I can be super flexible with the price. I can work it into our budget. We have like a $1500 budget but rentals really cut the cost down because we're not buying.  




 I have a rebel t3i and I'm about to start work on a short. What I do know is I want to use a wide angle lens. What I don't know is what to look for. I have no clue what all the numbers mean. 

What are some wide angle lenses that don't produce a lot of noise and grain and have a good, clean image? Price really isn't a factor because I'd be renting the lens. 




 But Seth McFarlane's new western comedy seems to be very Brooks-esque.  




 If you think Requiem is that depressing, you should watch Martyrs. You'll probably kill yourself.

Also, I forgot to mention it, but A Moment to Remember. It's on Netflix and is about two people who fall in love, but the girl develops Alzheimer's and starts losing her memory. Man, was this an emotionally wrecking film! But I love it and it's such a great movie. You ever need a good cry, watch this.  




 Yeah, that's what's keeping me from watching it, but I love long movies. It's just finding the time that's the problem.

I actually have a few questions about it, if you don't mind.

Is it an epic? Like it takes place over years?

I know you said it's great, but could you tell me why?

How's the cinematography? (weird question, I know, but I'm a sucker for great cinematography.) 




 See, this is what I find funny. Most people say they never want to see Requiem again, but I'm the total opposite. I love this movie and have seen it numerous times. You should totally buy it because 1) It's probably cheap and 2) it's a great movie! 




 Curious as to why you consider Martin Scorsese the mater of dream logic cinema. 




 This film has been sitting in my Netflix list forever.  




 I feel like I dislike the Kill Bill movies every time I watch them. I really liked them a lot the first time, but every time I rewatch one, it just feels different. Like I'm enjoying it less and less each time. And I don't really know what it is about them that does this to me.

Edit: this has nothing to do with Tarantino. I love all of his movies but this only happens when I watch Kill Bill. I can watch his other movies over and over and still love them, but there's just something about the Kill Bill movies.  




 This gets mentioned a lot when this subject comes up, but Dear Zachary. That movie is emotionally devastating. 

Another is Martyrs. This is easily one of the most depressing movies I've seen. I felt sick and ill and depressed watching it. It's seriously just a downhill slope the whole way. Never getting better, but always getting darker, more depressing, and disturbing. I own this film but never intend to watch it ever again, which is rare with me. It just...stuck with me. For days. I felt so hollow and cold after watching it. 




 I watched a Korean film called Marathon. Man, was this movie absolutely great.

Marathon, which is on Netflix, is the true story about a young man with Autism, raised only by his single mother, who finds solace in running. After running a bunch of 5ks, he wants to run a marathon. The whole film is his training for this marathon. 

Holy crap, was this a great movie! The acting was outstanding! It's definitely a tear-jerker, but you'll be crying tears of sadness and joy. This has to be one of the sweetest, most motivating and inspirational movies I've ever seen. I felt so good afterwards. I felt like I could take on anything after watching this! I really, really love this movie. It's great. Just absolutely fantastic.

There's really not a whole lot more I can say about it other than go watch it. It's seriously worth everyone's time. 




 I watched this little indie film on Netflix called The Diary of Preston Plummer. The synopsis Netflix told me was basically, "Preston is a college student with no direction who meets a girl and she asks him to drive her all the way home to Florida." Now I was in a drama mood and I love road trip movies, so I was expecting a lovely, great, road trip drama where these two strangers get to know one another and fall in love.

I was kind of disappointed with what I got though. Instead of a road trip movie. I got a movie that really only took place in one location. The entire road trip was probably like, 10 seconds? This film takes place pretty much entirely in Florida. I only mention this because I believe my wrong expectations may have affected my opinion of it as a whole. Now, don't get me wrong, it was still a decent drama. Just not what I was hoping for.

What it really is, is a story about this guy, Preston, who drives this girl Kate home to Florida from somewhere in the New England area. He agrees because he's looking for adventure and doesn't really know what to do with his life. When they get to Florida, he finds out that her parents own a hotel and allow Preston to stay there for a week free of charge. During this week, Preston and Kate grow close and we learn more about the two of them. Especially Kate, whose family is hiding something about Kate's past from Preston. Preston becomes curious and starts to do some digging. But will his digging bring him and Kate closer, or push them apart?

All in all, it's a really sweet film with some good drama, acting, writing, and beautiful cinematography of Florida. But nothing particularly special or outstanding. It has like a 6 on IMDB, which seems about right. I'd probably give it a 6.5, though. 




 That doesn't mean anything other than I've had *this* account for a year. I've had another account and before that, I lurked.  




 This place is older than 3 years, though. 




 Like I said, that place isn't exactly the friendliest. 




 Eh, it was more about how once it changed, it stopped changing and never went back or moved forward, which, I know, doesn't make a lot of sense. It does sound contradictory. That wasn't the intention though. 




 You're totally right in every way, but the problem is, if/when I make a discussion post, I *want* discussion, but due to the whole upvote/downvote system, if people either downvote or don't vote, or just don't care, then there is *no* discussion. 




 Look, you're right that I *do* have to really look for the "quality" posts. That's kind of my problem. People either downvote or don't vote at all on almost any post that goes against what usually makes it to the front page. Since the content on Reddit is mostly ranked by the users, there's really no solution other than outlawing certain types of posts like it says in the mod message you linked.

True, now isn't the best time to make my criticisms right now, because the mods made that post, so the posts I'm complaining about aren't being made. But what the mods are doing now isn't a permanent solution. At least not yet anyways. In the mod post you linked, it clearly says, "So we're going to try something out for the month of April and see how you guys like it." Emphasis on "*try*". It's not permanent, but hopefully it will be.

You're right, though. I was too harsh on the mods. I'm sure it's difficult running a huge subreddit, and I do appreciate that they are trying to fix things. It was uncalled for, and I apologize to the mods. 




 You're right, I'm not entirely innocent. But I do feel the post I've made here that weren't successful were attempts at creating discussion topics we don't normally see. And it's not just me either. Many people have their deep, fresh, thought provoking posts either downvoted or not voted on at all. Not voting is just as harmful as downvoting. Since this website really only determines what is on the front page by upvotes, if people don't upvote new, refreshing things, we won't see them. And instead, we see super hero posts, poster posts, celebrity gossip posts, and the same generic, rehashed questions. 




 Well I don't really think it matters since really no one will see this post. It's been downvoted and because it's not one of the things I listed, even if it was positive, no one would upvote it because it has nothing to do with super heroes, posters, or any of the other stuff that always makes it to the front page.

So in the long run, it doesn't matter if this is what I call "dealing with it" because this post won't change a thing. For the record, I don't call this dealing with it. I call me being quiet about it for years "dealing with it". People complain about this sub all the time in the comments, but no one makes a post about it. Yeah, I went kind of harsh about it and was maybe overly sarcastic and passive-aggressive.

The way I see it, if this post was genuine and I really did love this sub and gave reasons why, I'd still get downvoted, no one would see it because, again, it's not related to super heroes or posters or whatever so it wouldn't make it to the front page, and the few people who would see it would just comment and tell me I was wrong and that it actually sucks. 




 Oh look at you! You're so slick!

But seriously, there rally aren't many alternatives. I love film. It's my passion. But most of the people over at truefilm are not really welcoming and are happy to tear you apart at any given moment if you sound uneducated in film. 

There's casualfilm, which is a fantastic subreddit, but unfortunately there's not a lot of activity. Maybe like 3 or 4 post a week. 

There really aren't a lot of alternatives. So it's either unsub and don't get any movie related stuff, or deal with it and get crappy movie related stuff. But I guess we do what we have to do?

If you know any other good movie related subs for quality content, I more than welcome you to point me in the right direction.  




 Seriously, I love this subreddit! When I first discovered this subreddit, it had a lot of interesting stuff and discussions. I'm glad it's not that anymore. I'm glad it's turned into what it is now! I mean, I love that everyday the front page is just super hero stuff, news and rumors for whatever big blockbuster movie coming out, celebrity gossip, or one of the same 5 questions that get asked every week!

As someone who is afraid of new things and change, it's nice to know there's always /r/movies for when you need a subreddit that doesn't change!

I'm loving that everyday I can see what new poster was released! I love all the "look at all these movies you've seen, but probably haven't" posts we've had an influx of lately! 

But most of all, I'm glad that the only discussion posts making it to the front page are the same questions we see every week! That's the best part. The last thing I want is an original or thought provoking discussion on my /r/movies front page!

But, yeah, just wanted you all to know how much I love this subreddit! Whatever it is you're doing, mods, keep doing it! It's working perfectly! This is a fantastic sub because of it! 




 This makes me super excited for it. I'm so ready for John Woo to make a return to action movies and I can't wait to see what he does with The Expendables. 




 Yeah and Bad Boys 2 is a masterpiece of action. I love both of these movies.  




 "You guys havin a killer time?"

Also, "How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?" 




 Charlie's Angels. Both of them.  




 Yeah, make him a secret agent in a Cold War era James Bond type film.  




 I have a natural cowlick on the right side of my hair that makes it stick out of the side. I have yet to find an effective way of combatting it. What causes cowlicks? Is there a way to prevent it? Or fight it?

Please help! 




 So by flowing water do you mean waves? I know nothing about the outdoors.

Also, are there any more secluded areas where people don't generally go? Because I'm sure it will be busy this June, which is when we'd go. 




 Are there beaches at them? Like can I just walk up to the water? Cause I hear horseshoe lake has a lot of houses around it.  




 None of my family or friends know of any lakes besides the ones in Arkansas. Are those the closest ones or are there closer lakes?

Edit: Okay, new question: Which is easier to get to, Horseshoe Lake or Arkabutla Lake? Also, which is prettier? 




 That actually seems pretty intense 




 Really any place that is visually interesting or beautiful. Natural or man made. 




 I'm shooting a short film this summer in Memphis and I was wondering if anyone knew of some really interesting or beautiful locations. They can be either man made or nature made.  




 So another question: Since these are from different countries with different currencies, like amazon france, how would one pay for these? 




 Wow! Aren't they all pretty much region locked, though? 




 I hate you so much, I'm so jealous!! I really wish the US got more steel books. I wonder why we don't. Great collection by the way! 









 It could be worse. You could have a woman cut off your penis and throw it out the window of a moving car.  




 I'm trying to find someone to score a short film. I'm just not sure what subreddits to visit. Is there someone here with scoring experience or does someone know of a subreddit where I can find someone? 




 What would you consider good quality underwear and pants? 




 What do you do? Rub it on your thighs before you go to work? 




 I work a very active job that requires me to be mobile, but this job causes two terrible things to happen to me, sweating in my groin, which is gross, and chafing in my inner thighs from my legs rubbing together, which hurts.

Any tips on how to prevent or combat these two things? 




 I feel like I should be singing Christmas songs right now, I feel so jolly and generous! 




 I feel like its insane how people don't see a problem with changing Bond's race. He's not a racially ambiguous character. However, many times in the past when Hollywood has changed a beloved characters race, everyone was against it. 

What is it about the Bond character that makes people okay with changing his race? What if they changed Superman's race or Batman's race?

I do legitimately want some discussion on this topic but I don't dare ask /r/movies because I know I won't get any discussion there.  




 I played ep1 but I haven't played ep2 yet. Without spoiling it, what do you mean? What's different? 




 Oh no I'm talking about Spring Breakers! But I did love Mud too for the record.  




 Man I loved this movie. It was one of my favorites of last year!  




 I saw Panic Room again for like the fourth time. I really love this movie. It's such a tight thriller with no fat on it. It's just under two hours and doesn't take a brake. Unlike Contracted, which takes 40 minutes for things to pick up, Panic Room takes only 15 minutes for things to pick up. 

This a very solid movie. Not David Fincher's best, but it's one of my favorite Fincher movies. I'm actually shocked by how many people don't like this movie. Especially average movie goers. On IMDB it has a 6.3. Now I know IMDB isn't the judge of quality but a lot of its voters are your casual movie fans. This movie really seems like it would've been popular with a wide variety of people. It's thrilling, well directed and acted, and is shot beautifully. It's so easy to watch because the pacing is also great. 

I highly recommend this to any David Fincher fans or anyone looking for a great, tight thriller.  




 I watched this new movie recommended to me called Contracted. It's a body horror film. I wanted to watch it because I love body horror stuff. The friend that recommended it to me said it was super knarly and disturbing. When I heard this I immediately imagined a Cronenberg-esque movie with gross special effects. 

This movie was absolutely terrible. Like in just about every way. The story they tried to force in there was bland and boring. The acting was over dramatic. The writing was atrocious, and the characters were UNBELIEVABLY STUPID. I have never been so angry with characters before in my life. Nothing they said or did made any sort of sense. For example, and this isn't a spoiler, when the main character starts showing extreme physical deformities, EVERYONE asks if she's okay and she'll say,"Oh yeah I'm fine." And they all believe her. Can you not see she is seriously fucked up!!!

The only reason I wanted to see it was for some sick body horror and special effects. It didn't even deliver on those. Nothing really disturbing happens to her without spoiling it. The body horror stuff doesn't even start for 40 minutes. The first 40 minutes is literally just character set up. Which I understand because it is a movie after all, but they try to make you care for these characters by doing a terrible job forcing in love stories. I found myself not caring about anyone because they are all really dumb terrible people. 

This movie is boring, very poor, and isn't worth anyone's time. It's hard to even recommend to people who like horror or body horror movies because it doesn't even do well in those departments.  




 This was the first band I searched for. It's gotten better about it now. Now it has two songs from Downward Spiral, but the rest are still Hesitation Marks. 




 Why are you even here? This is over a hundred days old.  




 Scarface, the original one from 1932, but I didn't willingly watch it. I had to watch it for a class. I thought it was pretty boring. Not bad, I actually thought it was pretty good. Just boring. 

The oldest movie I *willingly* watched was The Good the Bad and the Ugly. I really love this movie a lot. It's what started my love of westerns, epics, and Clint Eastwood. It was also the longest movie I had seen at the time, which I thought was incredible.   




 It can be a true story or a work of fiction, but I really love movies that chronicle the rise and fall of characters. 




 Amazon most of the time. Or my local F.Y.E. I usually wait until like March to buy all the movies I want of the previous year. For example, This March of 2014, I bought every movie from 2013 that I wanted. And I'll do the same thing March 2015 for all the 2014 movies. It gives most the movies, besides November/December movies, time to drop in price so that every movie I buy isn't $25. Instead, they're more like $10-15 each, which I can feel less guilty about. 




 If you haven't seen it, you should most definitely see The Matrix. It's a masterpiece of action and science fiction. It had such an influence on not just sci-fi, but many other genres as well. 




 I think compared to most movies, The Matrix: Reloaded is actually pretty great, but compared to the first one, it's just good. The Matrix was such a masterpiece of action and sci-fi and had such a massive impact on culture that there was no way Reloaded could ever out do the first one. 




 But is it *good*? Like, "worth my $12" good? I am a big fan of Aronofsky, but from what I've seen of this movie, it doesn't look like an Aronofsky film. It looks like a generic action/adventure movie that could have been made by anyone. How much of an Aronofsky film is it? Because he's honestly the only reason I'd want to see it. 




 So my cousin is actually dating a guy who is related to your father. The funny thing is, I'm related to your mother. Small world. Fate finds a way, I guess. 




 That's exactly what I mean when I say he's unwilling to compromise. I was telling him just what you said and he disagreed and told me sometimes the older styles are better. 

I totally get wanting to follow in the steps and try and replicate a great director, but his determination to do this makes him very cliche and "copy and paste", and gives him no identity. No custom style. And if we want our projects to get noticed and stand out, we have to *stand out* and do something different. 

I probably sound like a douche talking about my friend because he *is* smart and very passionate about filmmaking. 

But yeah anyways. I'm not that far from you(barely). I'm in Tennessee. Not a lot of film community here.  




 I like to do more darker, bleak, surreal stuff like crime stories or dramas. He's a huge Spilberg fanboy, which is fine cause he's a good director, but it's really causing us to butt heads because he wants to do more feelgood, textbook style filming, which again, is fine. 

I like more modern movies and the only movies he has seen and love are pre 1990 stuff. Which in turn causes him to want to do dated and cliched stories and story beats. 

It's hard to explain, but his demeanor feels very much like he "owes" the "classics" so he tries to replicate that "classic" feel which honestly doesn't really work today. It really feels like he only loves classic movies because he feels like he's obligated to because every filmmaker is only suppose to like old movies. 

Anytime I bring up modern movies or modern trends and styles, he rolls his eyes and calls them inferior to the "classics".  




 Well I'm 7 days late but thought I'd still talk.

I'm in sort of the same situation. Filmmaker as well. However I do have at least one friend who I've been working with frequently. The problem is we are very different in our tastes and styles and he is unwilling to compromise, so we have started to hit walls when trying to come up with ideas.

I'm trying to broaden the amount of people to work with, but everyone else isn't as serious about it as I am. Everyone just wants to do it for fun, which is fine for them, but I want to make a career out of it whereas they have other careers in mind(doctor, lawyer, etc.,). So this leads to situations where I either have to work with my stubborn, uncompromising friend or work with people who goof off too much and don't care.

Too bad you and I don't live near each other(as far as I know. I'm assuming.). We seem to share the same interest.  




 Man, I should get Photoshop. Is it free at all? Like is there just a basic version that is free?

I frequent vgboxart.com which has tons of awesome custom movie box art and have always wanted to make/print one.
