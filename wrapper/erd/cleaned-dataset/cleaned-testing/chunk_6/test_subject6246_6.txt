 I love that video! Bookmarked it to save for a rainy day. :) 




 I have been doing Actives C25k program and am now on week 7. For about ten days now I have been telling myself that I don't have time for running. Or maybe I'm a little sick. Or that I deserve to take it easy right now since I have a lot at work. No training for ten days and no food logging for the first five of those. 

This is usually the beginning of the end for me. I start skipping some workouts and soon I just tell myself that it didn't work this time either. That I'm destined to always fail. Why even bother? 

This time I just said no. No, I'm not quitting. So I had some bad days? So what? I am not someone who quits. I went out today and did w7d2 and told myself the entire run that this is not me starting over, this is me just continuing. This is what I do now. It's not some temporary thing that I can quit whenever I feel like it. Because I'm not someone who quits. 

If I need a few days of for whatever reasons that is okay. But that is not me quitting. I promise myself that I will always continue as long as my body is capable. I'm no longer someone who quits. 




 I'm doing C25K for the first time. Today I did week 6 day 2 and then went home and got my four year old. We were watching her father run a local 10k race this friday and she wanted to try. 

I asked her where she wanted to run and she choose a nearby playground. She could probably beat me both in speed and stamina in the long run if she wanted to but I was a little bit worried that she was going to be bored quickly. We started jogging and she soon learned to match my pace. After a slow five minute jog we were at the playground. We did some easy exercises and raced each other over the field.

Then she wanted to ["rest"](http://i.imgur.com/oNO2urH.jpg) for a while. After that we did some [bodyweight exercises](http://i.imgur.com/OMGZy9W.jpg) (or as she thought, more resting). Then we did a slow jog home with some walking and sprinting. 

We were out for maybe 20 minutes. A really fun way of ending your own workout and involving your kids in it. She loved it. It was fun and playful but at the same time a real workout for both of us. I can really recommend it if you have kids! 

Working out is not always about performance, sometime it's just about moving your body and having fun. I really hope my kids will grow up remembering that and continue to have fun being active.  




 Remember that moment and use it when things get tough. That is what true happiness feels like. Thank you for sharing some of it with us! 




 I'm not the kind of person to post updates of all my workouts on Facebook. I don't want my struggle with my weight to be public and for everyone close to me to have an opinion on what I should eat and do. But this feels different. We're all in this together and I know that there are other people like me here. Every single comment I have received have been helpful and supportive. I don't feel alone in this anymore.
