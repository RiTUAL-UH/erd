 It was my friend's, hopefully they understand it died for a just cause. 




 Yeah, I didn't think so aha 




 Does the rice really work that well? 




 Currently I don't have a choice, but I really didn't foresee something like this happening 




 Can't say I wouldn't react the same way aha Gives me more confidence that my machine will come out unscathed 




 Okay, just performed this test and the fan doth spin. 




 What will this test do exactly? 




 I had serious issues with temps before but as soon as I moved down there I never went above approx. 30 




 Aha Yeah, I noticed that after I got a new CPU cooler but I never changed it since the basement keeps my PC super cool regardless. 




 If it was on, what's a possibility of the damage this would've cause? I wasn't home when it happened but my friend said he unhooked everything and took it out. If it was on and got unhooked do you think there would be any irreparable damage caused that way? 




 Luckily I have an extra PSU. I'm not sure it got water in it at all though, there was a Playstation sitting on top of it at the time and that was blocking the top fans. Plus, the GPU is monstrous and completely covers the PSU when sitting upright. I opened it up and only saw tiny tiny water droplets on the motherboard and a bit of moisture on the GPU. It just happened a bit ago and the PC was the first thing we took out. 









 I'm a movie lover, a gamer, etc. It's what I enjoy. Not a waste if it's something you love. 









 Absolutely agree. 




 I am so sorry. 




 It's such a dramatic way to start your day. It really feels like an epic beginning, like you're watching color flood the world. 




 I would purchase your room.
