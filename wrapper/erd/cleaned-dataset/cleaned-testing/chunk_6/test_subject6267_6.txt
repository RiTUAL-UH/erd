 YESS!!! In school I used to lift up the back of my skirt to the fan in the summer or the heater in the winter to cool/warm my bum, it was incredible!!! 




 I skip the last few steps in my routine when its humid, i.e. Origins Overnight Treatment, Innisfree Green Tea Sleeping Pack

On the central line today I could bear it no longer, I brought out my facial mist from Tosowoong and doused myself in the land-of-no-AC 




 Oooooohhh might have to give this one a go, I don't mind a little glitter on the lower waterline but not a big fan if its on the top lash line. I'll give the Clio one a go tomorrow as I'm going swimming, so we'll see how that works out.

Do you use any liquid liners by the way? 




 Does the Holika Holika stay on your eyes??? *heart beats excitedly in hope*

The worst would probably be the L'Oreal Kohl one, oh LAWD. That thing is supposed to 'glide on'- it doesn't, it tugs like Ruby Woo would and then melts so fast. The Rimmel Scandaleyes in Black was almost just as bad, I wink a fair bit (I hate posing in pictures and selfies) and my right eye was a complete panda eye and the left smudged all over my 'aegyo sal'. 

Also, do you use the liners on the waterline or lashline or both? 




 I don't usually wear a primer but the #1 was such a disappointment, I had it on my upper waterline and it smeared all over my lower lashline. Have you tried the Rimmel Scandaleyes? I had the black one in that and that was awful too. 




 My products came in yesterday and I thought I would do some swatches, in all honesty I applied all 3 eyeliners before showering an hour later and I really wasn't impressed with lasting power.

London is going to be sweltering the next few days so I'll put these to the test and get back to you guys.

 I used one last night (literally just woke up and I'm checking this sub...) and it's amazing. I used to use Mario Badescu's drying lotion and then Missha's Acence Pink Spot but the MB absolutely dried out my skin and left me with huge scabs so now I have to deal with the scarring and PIH :(

The best part was they were 29 RMB so around 3 for me and $4 for 4 packs!!!  




 1. I first lightly steam my face with a muslin cloth folded over or microfibre cloth and then squeeze the product out and WIPE OFF. The applicator is absolute shite and if you notice, a lot of the gel ends up behind the main 'platform'.

2. Wash that gunk off yo face.

3. Rinse that gunk off and shake vigorously to get it as dry as possible.

4. Not really, although I haven't seen great results and I feel like a physical exfoliant (am using the Missha D-tox peeling gel atm) works far better. 









 Does the undertone lean towards yellow? I really want to try a cheaper cushion to see how I feel about the 'air puff' concept and the Innisfree ones are so light in colour  




 I've never tried this band but pearl cream is like a thick cream thats really rich, normally this stuff has the consistency of a gel but definitely takes a long time to absorb but I don't know with yours seeing as they're little balls. I use a different brand but pearl creams have been used in China for a REALLY long time.

I would say do use with caution though some people may react to the herbal ingredients and although there are a lot of poorly made products out there, not everything is bad and not everyone is trying to con you.  




 To be honest, I haven't tried the other formulation so I don't really know, the brightening one is very runny though, the essence drips down my neck so I have to have it on lying down haha. You're probably off buying them on RRS buy the box really, they probably work out to be cheaper like that anyway.

Oh RRS totally mark down the value of things so go wild next time, my $90 order was marked as $7 and Jolse marked a $30 to $7 too! I was really nervous the first time I ordered from them both but was really surprised and ecstatic when they came! 




 Ahhhh, sorry my mistake. Its just that I know Jolse and RRS both lower the value of the shipments, my last $90 order was written as $7, and I couldn't find any information if other stores do so too. Maybe I'll take the risk with TK or BeautyNetKorea though! 




 The toner and lotion sound pretty appealing! Have you seen much difference or improvement with them? 




 It's cause I'm in the UK and I'm really trying to avoid VAT and 'handling' charges from EMS, as far as I know, most stores apart from RRS and Jolse will use EMS 




 I have been refreshing RRS for 6 consecutive days trying to buy the Longer Name ampoule to surprise my mum who is soon returning from a 3 month work trip, but to no avail (does this mean its sold out?). Is there is anything you would recommend from the line excluding the FTE, targeting PIH and ageing skin?  




 Yeah! In the States, they're called that!! Mmmnnn, I believe that gravy is mix of fish sauce and soy sauce, mine was predominately beansprouts, velveted chicken, shredded carrots and rice vermicelli although I wasn't too keen on the chilli sauce I had 









 I always make this when coming home from a long trip or when I'm jet lagged and knackered, takes no longer than 10 mins and so delicious 




 Yeah, Chengdu is definitely more of a business hub these days and I'm confident Chengdu will have a Sasa. Personally I wouldn't buy anything in Sasa in store, there aren't really any 'exclusives' that you won't be able to get elsewhere online. I do normally buy MBD masks from Watson's though, they're around 88 RMB for me, so like 8 and about $10 if you're in the US?

I'm actually based in the UK haha, but I was born in Beijing and lived there till I was 5, and spend my summers there (will be heading home next week wooo!). I did use SAL shipping on Rakuten to avoid some cheeky EMS customs issues though

P.S. Remind him to keep hydrated, I know Chengdu is an absolute boiler of a place and personally, I can't stand the humidity and heat there, seeing as London gets to ~27 degrees max. If he gets heat rashes the Johnson's Baby Heat Rash powder (comes in a pouch like a yoghurt pouch) one is good to dust on and available at most supermarkets. My nearest 7/11 in Beijing has them too! 




 Same!!! On their old website, it took me so long to figure out the search function and the importance of the square brackets haha! Plus, I love their 'Sort By' function for Lowest  Highest....ahh such sweet is student life... 




 Sadly, I haven't tried many Japanese products but am waiting on my first Rakuten order to get my Heroine Kiss Me!

Where in China is he at the moment? The best stores to hit up would be Sasa, Watson's (a drugstore) and Mannings (another drugstore). Watson's do this great birds nest and an aloe vera mask I love- they both have loads of essence left so I just soak a paper mask in it with some warm distilled water and its so refreshing in the Beijing humidity
