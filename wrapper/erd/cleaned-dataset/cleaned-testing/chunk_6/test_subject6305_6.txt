 Kyle or Chad. I've never met anyone named Kyle or Chad who wasn't a douchebag 




 I think that this happened to show that despite the attributes I described he's still a human, and humans fuck up.  




 I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck.
