 True but my idea is not a cure but rather a treatment for my reoccurring mrsa infections. I get your point though. 




 The MRSA foundation, a California based 501 non-profit, has a website not a blog . Also don't take the word conspiracy so seriously. Most /r/conspiracy posts are not true conspiracy's but rather  is a subreddit where people can post unconventional ideas and have open minded people look at them . Think abstraction not literal. 




 When post cools down I will get a hold of you. It might be tomorrow. 




 I am a creative nut. What can I say. 




 No problem. 




 My naval education background from 2.5 years of electronics schools which are all MIT based and taught by lockheed Martin instructors gave me an educational backround which helped me come up with idea. Plus I am a strange nerd. On my spare time, I read peer reviewed scientific papers on all subjects. It's fun.Proud Veteran. Have a problem with it. Your problem. 




 I put a MRSA foundation web page not my youtube video on r/technology so I don't understand what you are talking about. 




 Tell it like it is. Proud Veteran. ProtoDong can't bully me. You are correct it is just reddit.  




 Ok moderater get the point go back to r/technology and leave us "crazy" people alone. Ok. Over and out 




 /u/ProtoDong what makes you the gatekeeper. Your job as a moderator should be too control trolling not the free flow of ideas. I have treated three MRSA infections with my idea in the presence of a retired microbiologist . Let the people decide. 




 Sorry moderator /u/ProtoDong  giving truth not dark triad manipulation. 




 That is why I use a 1000 hydroponic bulb. You are correct though on lower wattage bulbs. A 1000 watt bulb gives the necessary skin penetration.  




 My idea also helps lighten scar tissue which would help military IED blast victims.  




 Hopefully my youtube video's will go viral before the FDA shut's me down. 




 Good idea.  




 Reddit is awesome but needs new leadership. The purpose of the moderator's should be too enforce no trolling rules not to be the gatekeepers of new ideas.  




 Ok. What % upvote should be a veto proof %. Any suggestions. 




 Good one. Remember too be civil. LOL  




 Google blue light mrsa and look at the peer review research.  




 Thank you for reply. I am sorry some people are so bitter that they can't believe me. I am both a patriot and care about humanity. The inspiration of this video comes from my little brother in the Marine Corp and a special French woman  I meet while in the Navy. She was and is a secular saint. Love you girl. 




 Or I could just quit technology subreddit and post in conspiracy section from now on. I have found smart people  in this subreddit. 




 Youtube doesn't update views in realtime. They do this too verify views are real not bots. 




 Something dark triad personality types will never understand. 




 Glad you liked idea. 




 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis_Combat_System
Click on link. Click on overview section. Check out diagram (Baseline 2-6). I am right buddy. 




 You don't know what you are talking about. The Tomahawk cruise missile is part of the AEGIS sweet. The AEGIS radar and mainframe computer systems control the Tomahawk cruise missile. All fire control systems on a destroyer are called AEGIS. USS Mitscher (DDG-57) FC3 Veteran. No reason to name call buddy. 




 Thank you for your advise. I am new too reddit. I would have been top post on r/technology  if I wasn't deleted. There need to be a rule, assuming post is legal, that if up votes are above a certain % that moderators can't delete posts. This will prevent censorship. 




 My half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype machine.

 On my youtube channel there is my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. I have spent over $2,000 of my own money building it. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. I do not work for any company but rather understand the pain this flesh eating disease brings. It's called empathy folks. Something some of the nasty people on r/technology don't understand. If you don't agree with me downvote me.
 




  "Learned helplessness" is not something  this Veteran respond's too.  




 Maybe.

 I worked on the AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile systems when I was in the Navy. 




 MRSA foundation just shared my youtube video and story.  




 I have tried that doesn't work. 




 I love reddit but what they did too my successful post was uncalled for. Also, unlike this post, I posted a MRSA foundation webpage not my youtube video.I may have an idea which could save millions of lives and save governments billions of dollars. Last year 700,000 people died from mrsa, I know how to treat it. If you disagree with me than down vote me. Don't censor me /u/ProtoDong. US Navy AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile veteran

 Your questions are valid. You would think there would be fuel use issues but space X claims they can do it.  




 Super bright blue light pentrates the skin. It doesn't matter anyway. Even  though I had 87% up votes my post was deleted. 




 No. But my posted was deleted anyway. Just trying to help.

 Your opinion. 




 Maybe. 




 I will take it too court. 




 Yep. Current patent system sucks.

 Retired microbiologist comments on my mrsa treatment idea

 Thank you. I hope idea can't be patented. Then I can spend my time raising awereness for this mrsa treatment method. 




 Not necessarily. The 1000watt blue spectrum hydrolux weed grow bulb used in video is new technology.  




 Thank you for input.
