 My mistake, it was a typo. Thanks!

As this is my first build, are there any peripherals I would need which I wouldn't think of? (And on that note, is there a wifi card/adapter you would recommend?  




 I'll get one when I start overclocking in the future. Thank you! 




 Sorry, I'm **not** overclocking, but I might in the future. I have a huge backlog of older games to play before I start on new ones, and I'm not too picky about FPS. I'll save the OC for the future. 




 Thanks for your help! I just bought everything today. I'm hoping to build it over thanksgiving. My final build:

 This is my build. This forum has helped me a lot over the past few weeks, so I'm going to ask one last time before I commit. I am NOT overclocking right now, but I'm leaving it open as option for the future. The parts are all bought, and currently unopened and returnable. Can I change anything to make it better?

I've got it all sitting in my living room, to put together over Thanksgiving. Did I do anything majorly wrong? Anything I should change? I did want to get it around $600, I tried to get the best possible deals, and I'm satisfied with this build and its price. Thanks for all your help!
 




 Haven't heard of it before now, and i'm a FE fan. thanks! 




 What is this game? 




 For free? Damn, I missed that. Hopefully it comes up again. 




 Is it worth it to get dragon age at this price, or should I wait? 




 Copy paste is magic!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.
Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this!

In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.

As for what the prophecies of the Messiah actually are, that was addressed elsewhere. 




 says you, this is not what the person that originally wrote the text believed is it?

Because the punishment for sex before marriage is zero, while adultery's is stoning. Can you give an argument aside from "well that's what you say?"

 there are seven laws to match the seven virtues and seven sins

or maybe the opposite, don't you think?

these of course stem from the seven visible astral bodies common to the ancient religions

Never heard of this. Link please?

again, this is entirely your opinion and not in anyway proven fact, what the author intended is unknown and has been debated often -- you seem to be arguing from the stance that adam and eve really were the first people created and that all humanity stems from them, as you're no doubt aware this view is contentious even within modern Judaism, it's certainly not accepted by secular science.

If we're talking about the author's intent, secular science doesn't matter. If you're disputing my claim about Genesis 9:4, here's the simple proof: The text itself. Adam was given only the plants to eat, while Noah was given the animals (9:3). How is allowing you to eat animals encouraging vegetarianism? Yes, it might say vegetarianism is preferable, but eating meat is certainly allowed -- but eating blood is not.

The reality is...

I have no idea what your point is here, it seems you're just rambling. 

to say you can claim with absolute authority that you know what the author of the commandments intended to convey is just sillyness(sic).

You only have one way of evaluating this, via the text. I get my claims from analysis, not just by "knowing." You want to say I'm wrong, prove me wrong.

uh, it's from the exact bit i was just talking about and how it's clearly actually intended to be a reference to the same thing mentioned in the commandment.

No, grafting is not part of the Noahide law. It is given to Jews, as "don't plant two types of seeds in a field (Lev. 19:19). It has nothing to do with Noah, or animals, or blood.

yes secular law is important because the vague notions hinted at by idealogical theologians as formed into firm sounding aphorisms are entirely meaningless - are you suggesting that the all wise god in his infinite glory decided to troll us with a set of laws with absolutely no use for no reason but to inspire us to craft sensible ones for his followers to oppose on religious grounds? [as the abolution of slavery, womens lib, civil lib and etc, etc, etc have and often still are fought against in the name of the lord?]

You sound like you have a chip on your shoulder. God gave us laws, and the tools with which to create more related to our situations. We are not yet in the Messianic age. 




 brings up the fascinating question of what is a false god, i guess Jesus Christ counts right?

Possibly. It is an argument.

likewise adultery, what does it mean? today we use this to mean clandestine extra-marital sex but it can, and did, mean a much more general thing including sex before marriage.

It means consensual sex when you are engaged or married to another person. Sex before marriage is not adultery.

Seven is the most absurd of course, take an example - are we to say that Martin Luther King for example did not support the rule of law but he did support justice?

Laws between society differ. Just because this is complicated doesn't mean it is absurd. You're way of interpretation isn't necessarily correct, and you're jumping to the worst possible conclusion.

number six of course is kinda bizarre, and lets be honest here you're not kidding anyone - certainly not the all knowing king of kings, if he's still about - but first let's assume your version is how it's intended,

You're not making sense, of course this is what is intended. Why do you think differently?

 doesn't that fact that with only seven slots available one of them is dedicated to something so ridiculous kinda make the whole set look silly

That's only with your incorrect assumption that there are only seven slots. If this law wouldn't be there, there would only be six, and if another one needed to be tacked on, it would be 8. No cosmic force is forcing seven laws over any other number. I'm not going to go into the why of it now.

If this rule ever meant anything it's tied to Genesis 9:4  But flesh with its soul, [which is] its blood, you shall not eat' which is a pretty clear call to if not total vegetarianism at least abstaining from red meat, something likely copied from the other religions of the region and 'updated' in much the way Paul 'updates' foreskins for Christians

You are absolutely wrong. That says that you can't eat the blood of the animal, not to be vegetarian. In fact, Adam and his descendants were originally vegetarians, and only Noah and his descendants were allowed meat after the flood. 

As i'm sure you're aware the traditional Jewish interpretation understands this as being a rule which even forbids the grafting of different species of fruit trees - a method of yield boosting now pretty much default the world over.

Wrong. That is from somewhere entirely different.

as for the others, is piracy theft? or is property theft? what is murder? is war murder? is poverty murder? is self-defence murder? in which case what is self-defence? is forcing your reluctant wife to sleep with you rape?

Good questions! These are things to be ironed out, don't you agree? That is what the rule of law is for.  




 Yeah, I don't have that kind of money to spend. :P do you have a reccomendation for a Z97 mobo under $100? 




 Yes, through the 30th

I'm thinking of upgrading the motherboard, since I managed to save money elsewhere, I might want to overclock in the future, and the computer will only be as strong as it's weakest link. 

I'm willing to go to about $650 for the build, which would gives me an extra $80 for the mobo, give or take. Micro Center is having a deal for $40 off a motherboard with a i5-4690k. What can I get that is under $120 on [this list](http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33)
of eligible motherboards, that is the best price for performance? I'm not looking for extremely high end, and my preferred price would be $70. What do you think? 




 I have no idea what to look for.  Could you link me to something that will help?  




 Wow, ok. I'm updating from a crappy laptop, so this is amazing. I don't really care about going over 60FPS, as my monitor won't support it; I care more about smooth performance over high graphics anyway. What about some of the newer games, like DA:I?

This is my current build. What will I be able to play with this? Can I play Skyrim on ultra at 60FPS, for example? How about some of the newer games that are just now coming out? Thank you! 




 That case was $65 FOUR days ago. Argh. Other recommendations have been corsair 200R/300R and the NZXT S340. What are your opinions on those?

I'm at the Boston MC, which I think has pretty much everything new in stock. But it seems like all the mAtx sold are actually *more* expensive, so I might go with the ATX instead. There are just so many options that are hard to tell apart. :/ The Z87 boards are a lot cheaper -- would there be a significant drop in performance, or another reason not to get them? I'm looking at [this one](http://www.microcenter.com/product/417392/Z87_PRO3_Socket_LGA_1150_ATX_Intel_Motherboard_-_Refurbished) in particular. 




 The motherboard is part of a microcenter deal of $40 off a cpu and mobo. Motherboards are more complicated than almost anything else, so I'm not exactly sure what I should get. Is there a relatively cheap unlockable mobo? Also, what is better in the long run -- Atx or mAtx?

The case was recommended to me. What is another good budget case that you know of?

 




 Not sold at microcenter, unfortunately. I'm not passing up their $40 off a mobo deal 




 I wanted to keep it under $800 maximum, and preferably closer to $600. Do you know of an overclockable but still inexpensive motherboard?
 




 Ok, how can I make my current build more upgradable? This is what I'm currently getting:

Can I do anything better? 




 I'm not actually going for overclocking, that's just the best deal MC has. Would I *need* a Z97 or else the build won't work, or can the CPU and mobo still work like this? 




 I'm also building something similar for the first time (and on a budget), so here is what I got so far:

I don't need to overclock, but Microcenter is offering a deal for $40 off the motherboard for certain cpu's, so the 4690k saved me $20. Is  this a good budget build? What do you think? 




 My body is ready, but my wallet is empty... 




 What are the differences between all the different types of Motherboards? This is my current, potential-but-not-right-now overclocking build:

I'm going for the least expensive Z97. Is that a good idea? Why or why not? 




 This is my build:

As this is my first time building, I want a mid-Tower: Enough space to maneuver in, but also not huge. I don't want to spend too much on the case, and I don't care too much about style. What are my best options? 




 How can you use the OS without using these? 




 For what reason? 




 I'm building a new PC, and I'm not sure which one to get. Both are free. Windows 7 is older, but I've heard nothing but bad news about 8. Which one would you recommend?  




 http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33 




 Yeah. Unfortunately my MC doesn't have that mobo in stock. :( 




 That's $70 more, not $30 




 shhhhh, it's a myssssstery. 




 Simple question: What do you do for the best price? Is it better to buy now and on Black Friday, or is it better to wait and get post-Black Friday sales? 




 Should I jump on sales now or wait for after Black Friday? 




 I building the exact same computer as you. Just know that Microcenter currently has a deal for $40 off the motherboard if you buy a 4690k! 




  Obviously there are exceptions to this. And having gender-neutral bathrooms shouldn't involve the removal of urinals. But why not just have one big fucking bathroom with all the stalls and urinals?

Maybe because some people are uncomfortable with it, and they would rather only have people of the same sex in the bathroom? Especially when the bathroom includes showers, for example? Should these be denied a comfortable space? 




 Yeah, I saw that. I JUST ordered the 600W one yesterday, so I'm seeing if I can cancel it. I'm going to micro center soon to pick up the last parts so I'll hopefully build it sometime next week. I can't wait to actually play games decently; and not just decently, but good.

Good luck with yours!

Looks like you're overclocking and I'm not, otherwise these are pretty much the same. I'm also thinking about switching the PSU, and I got a cheaper RAM deal. It's reassuring that we have the same build, it means I probably didn't screw up! 




 Are you me? I'm doing the exact same thing, except my laptop is four years old. want to compare? 




 This is incorrect. The hebrew word in the texts of Isaiah could be understand as either maiden or virgin but the Greek word used in the New Testament has no such ambiguity. It only means virgin. The writers of the New Testament understood the words of Isaiah to mean "virgin" and that is why the Greek word for virgin is used and not the Greek word for "maiden".

This is one of the most conceited things I have ever heard. You think your translation, written hundreds of years later, is better than the original text?
 




 I'm getting i5 4590k, and it's the first time building a computer. Thanks for the chance! 




 Currently, there is a 2TB Hybrid SSD on sale for $80 on amazon. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a hybrid vs. a HDD or regular SDD? 




 If I want to spend $50-70, what is the best one to get? 




 Is the tomb raider bundle worth it? I've never played a tomb raider game before. 




 Right now it's $130 on newegg. How does it compare to the one I'm getting? 




 Ow well. This is the first time building a computer anyway, so take my advice with a grain of salt. 




 If you have access to microcenter, I have a very good and cheap build I'm making. Take a look at my history. 









 It's called both, depending on who you're talking to.

My laptop was expensive in 2010, but probably the most expensive piece of junk for gaming you could buy. I got sick of barely even being able to play Morrowind, so I decided to finally get off my ass and do something about it.

I don't know much about building, so I looked for the cheapest prices for the best components. I really only need games to run on high at 30 FPS, but I would like this to last for some years. I think I got some pretty good deals for that. What do you think? Anything I should change? 




 Switched, thank you. 




 I took the SSD because it seemed really cheap for the amount of storage, and the 128GB isn't that much less expensive. 
 
Thanks for the ram tip.

I'm not sold on any of this -- if you have a better idea, let me know! This is my first time building, so I've been a little bit lost the last couple of days. Anything I should change? I'm trying to build a gaming pc which will run new games smoothly on high/ultra for the next 4-5 years (I'm fine going to 30FPS). Anything else I should look at? Are there better deals? Thank you! 




 The non-k series is actually more expensive right now oddly enough 




 I'm not; I'm only getting a such good cpu and graphics card because they're so cheap for the power, and they will last a long time. 
 




 The SSD is $20 off at microcenter, and I might wait for a sale on a different 1TB hard drive. Do all the parts fit together, and will I need anything else? I have a monitor, OS, etc. already.

 Ah, drat, you seem to be right. And the dell forums said no other boards will fit. :( I'll take it apart to check anyway, but it looks like a new case is in order. 




 How do I do that? 




 Great explanation, thank you. I'll make my list and check back to buildapc when it's finished to make sure all the parts are good. 




 Alright, I'll open up the case tomorrow and poke around. 

Another noob question, if you don't mind: I'm finding lots of differently priced options for video cards. For example, the Radeon R9 280: [This](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J7YFUPA/?tag=pcpapi-20) vs. [this](http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-Radeon-PCI-Express-Graphics-11230-00-20G/dp/B00IZXOW80/? tag=bom-tomshardware-20). Are there significant differences, or should I just get the cheapest? 




 Thank you! Is there any reason not to get a better graphics card? I'm looking at the Radeon R9 280, for example, which is currently $140 




 Thank you. What does OEM mean?

This one is 17" long, 7.5" wide, and 16" tall. Is this standard? 




 Thank you! 




 I haven't had any pride for years!

I'm new at this, and I'm going for a relatively cheap build. What are the advantages of getting a new case? 




 No, I'm cheap. :P But seriously, are there any technical reasons not to use an old case? 




 I have an old case from around 10 years ago, which originally ran windows vista. It is a mid-tower. Is there any reason not to use it and instead get a new one?

[Link to the exact case.](http://www.pcworld.com/product/29437/dell-dimension-e521.html)

Thanks! 




 Is there any reason not to use an older case? I have one from about 10 years ago, and would use it if I could. ([Link to case](http://www.pcworld.com/product/29437/dell-dimension-e521.html)) 




 Thanks! I'm not even sure what I'm even buying yet, but this seemed the right price for a good card. I just wanted to make sure that this wasn't a steal.  




 Is it worth it to buy the video card right now? That is a large price off. 




 But that is not what the maps show... 




 He needs therapy, today.  




 And by "we", the jews mean "dead members of our ~~religion~~ tribe about 3500 years ago, which we know because ~~it's written in a book~~ our ancestors told it to their children, who told it to their children, and which is written down in a book we've been passing down for all of those generations that we read in its original language".

Whereas when the mormons say "they", it means "dead members of ~~our religion~~ a random tribe from 2500 years ago, which we know because it's written in ~~a book~~ some random text who this one person translated".

 




 Because the Mormons say that "they mass witnessed something," while Jews say "**we** mass witnessed something." 




 Wikipedia! But what does that have to do with this discussion? 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming, programming, Internet and watching movies. I'm not too picky about graphics; I just need something like Skyrim, for example to run on high at around 30 FPS. I'm more interested in smooth graphics than impressive ones.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$600-800

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Anytime in the next two months, when the best deals will be.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything aside from the OS, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Massachusetts, and yes.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Probably just older ones from around the house. Would this be a problem?

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No, probably not.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would want a decent amount of storage so that I don't have to worry about it anytime soon, but that is all.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

No, but is there a preference for one or the other?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I'm just sick of having a bad laptop and want something decent, and that will be able to last at least a couple of years. (I can barely play Morrowind right now.) Thank you! 




 Open up the book and see what it says

"This says my ancestors all stood at this mountain and listened to a god. I asked my dad and said he never heard of it. Why should I listen to you?"  




 No, the difference is that eternity will eventually answer. 




 The Palestinians are saying it is tainted by prayer, not us. 




 Yom Kippur is just a day of concentrated repentance, and only for sins between man and God. 

[This](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Yom_Kippur/In_the_Community/Prayer_Services/Confession/Confessing_Sins/Connecting_Sin_and_Repentance.shtml?p=0) is a short primer on repentance in Judaism, and [here](http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/repentance) is a deeper look into the subject. 

 




 Just google either. There is only a slight difference but I appreciate your need to be pedantic to attempt to prove your point.

Hey, you asked, I answered. It is definitely ethnic cleansing.

In any case, Israel has been a bad neighbor, they have no one to blame for any bad feelings towards them in the region but themselves.

Really? You think Israel is to blame for all the wars it has fought? 

What about Ethiopian Jews?

Originally from the Levant. And even if they weren't, people can be adopted into the tribe. 




 Fan fiction.  




 Nope, not at all. Why are you equating the fruit to all sin? There are specific punishments for specific sins, and specific ways to repent for specific sins. If every sin caused death, we would all be dead long ago.

Life is about improving yourself, not about dying. 




 The price to pay for sinning is dying.

But this is not true. 




 ~~telling~~ toeing the line

FTFY

 




 Ethnic cleansing and genocide are two distinct crimes, though they are often wrongly conflated by people who like throwing out buzzwords. And Jews are an ethnic group who share the religion Judaism. 




 They are also a bit of a far cry from voting on whether or not Jews should be ethnically cleansed from the region.

What do you think "return to their home countries" mean aside from ethnic cleansing? 




 Not Judaism! 




 To get your edit out of the way first, you cannot directly cause an action which is intended to give you a benefit that breaks Shabbat. It gets complicated, but this definitely falls under forbidden.

To me, yes, it is entirely indisputable that igniting a gas by way of a spark is the same thing as lighting a fire. Do you have an argument to how it is different? 




 Because then you would know that lighting a fire, especially in regards to a car, is not a more complicated subject. Yes, there are always deeper layers, but this is not one of them. 




 So why don't you learn the sources instead of criticizing it? 




 Yes, and everyone will agree with you (I hope). But to some, observing Judaism (the active part of being Jewish) is taking that commitment. 




 Not really, there is a reason it is its own movement and not a sub group. But, even so, what's your point? 




 Not true. If you want to say it is similar in principle, you have to prove it from the theology. 




 Just because it was formed out of Reform, does not mean it is comparable to reform. 




 I do not, personally, try to live my life in order to "fit in" with Christian society.

He didn't say that, just that it was originally founded to fit in more with Christian society, which is pretty much indisputable. Reform has changed quite a lot in the past 150 years.

In addition, you are kind of are admitting it. You are just using "modern" instead of Christian, but it has the same connotation: the mitzvot, as enumerated by the rabbis, are not something you want to totally incorporate into your life. That's fine, but it is not the same thing as Judaism was before.
 




 A 50 year ceasefire does not mean "Openly at war" still. You sound like one of the idiots that thinks North Korea and America are suddenly just going to start shooting each other at the drop of a hat.

Do you not follow the news? That border, though quiet, has been seen a number of attacks since the last ceasefire. Israel can and will bomb Syria at the drop of a hat if it feels threatened, like transfers of long range missiles to Hezbollah.

Israel helping ISIS and other rebel groups though this conflict by bombing SAA bases has just further destabilized this conflict, 

Israel has only bombed in two situations: In the case of a threat like above, or if any fire lands on Israel's side of the border. If they were bombing bases like America, you would hear about it. 




 You think Israel and Syria aren't at war? Wow. 




 Yes, and they have been at war for decades. 




 tell me, how is it racist? 




 is that supposed to be a bad thing? 




 There been a lot tension in Jerusalem with the Al-Aqsa Mosque and settlement.

What exactly is your view of what is happening there? 




 They will if they ever get control. 




  Something happened to cause multitudes of people to change their faiths from Judaism to Christianity against the establishment,

This didn't happen, unless by multitudes you mean "dozens." Almost all of the converts were Roman, not Jewish. 




 Is there any way to corroborate this? Right now all there is as evidence is one unsourced comment on the article.
