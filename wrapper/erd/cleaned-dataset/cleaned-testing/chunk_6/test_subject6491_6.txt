 On the subject of movies, **Limitless** is one of the most stupid movies ever made. A guy uses a drug to analyze the markets and practically see the future when it comes to stocks, but he needs to get money from a loan shark to open his first account. 

In reality, if you had such a power, you can open a forex account (or binary options account) with $200, move to regular brokerage account in a month, and make it a billion within a year.

 I suggest that you saute the onions first in a skillet. That will greatly improve the flavor.

If you have enough time and don't want to use skillet, you can slowcook them for several hours before starting your dish. Or, the best option, slowcook large batch on onions (6-8) with some olive oil for 8 hours on low, then divide to 4 portions and freeze. Whenever a recipe calls for onions, add it from the freezer (no need to thaw).

 Plus, the survival rate in a competitive food market (like large cities and business areas) is usually among the lowest of all businesses. In some areas only 25% of restaurants survive the 3rd year (in NYC for example, it's 20% live past the 5th year).

  How is this any different?

Because food, cloths and entertainment aren't preserved as morally equal. I'm not saying those game farms are wrong or immoral, but I can see how it's on the far side of the scale.

Also, breeding animals for food (and the questionable living conditions and slaughtering techniques) is one of the major factors of lifting people above poverty and hunger levels. Many people simply couldn't afford meat if it wasn't delivered like that. While zoos and entertainment farms mostly serve the rich. So I think that point also add to the differences between them.

Anyway, at least those animals get a chance to escape their hunters, put up a fight and die in nature.

 I adopted the recipe from [here]( http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/black-bean-squash-chili).  
The only challenge is to peel the squash, but other than that, easy and tasty. I also added celery and stirred all the spices in the skillet together with the peppers, I think it brings up more flavors.
 
#Ingredients

* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 3 onions, chopped 
* 4 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 2 jalapeos, seeded and minced 
* 4 15-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained 
* 2 14.5-oz. cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes 
* 3 tablespoons chili powder 
* 2 tablespoons cumin 
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
* 4 cups butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
* Salt and pepper 

#Preparation

1. Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut onions until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; saut 1 minute. Add bell peppers and jalapeos; saut until tender, about 3 minutes.
2. Transfer pepper mixture to slow cooker. Stir in beans, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Arrange squash on top. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours.

#Cooking the rice

In a pot heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add 1 cup of rice and stir to have it all covered. After 2 minutes add boiling water or chicken broth if you prefer more flavorful rice, bring to boil again and let it cook for 10 minutes on low burner. After that, remove from the heat and set it aside undisturbed for another 10 minutes.

 Yeah, but don't forget that insurance in mandatory by law in most areas of the world. So it will take time until they'll feel pressure to lower rates. In fact, they are in for some good years with same premiums but less accidents.  




 I wouldn't go far and calling it a scam. There are some unique (and shady) characteristic in the industry:

* It's one of the few industries in which you pay, sometimes years, before you get the service with a chance that you might never actually get it. The company gets to keep the money (and invest it) without actually putting it to work towards the product.
* The standard procedure to get the service you paid for is to sue (either you sue the insurance company or they sue another company).
* It's one of the few industries in which the most important department is the legal department.
* There are lots of scams against insurance companies. It's probably the biggest victim of customers' theft.
* There's an information gap in a sense that the customer usually knows more about the product than the seller (typically it's the other way around).
* Some of the services are mandatory by law. 




 Yeah, HTPC users wouldn't mind, but the fact that it won't be available is seems on Android tablets (I use mine to watch netflix occasionally) and chromecast sucks. At least at the beginning anyway. 




 It says PC is okay. So HTPC users wouldn't mind. But still, blocking it out from Android tablets, consoles, chromecast is risky as hell. I guess not only that Apple paid a lot, but also HBO is very confident to launch in a narrow market. 




 It's a brave decision in the wrong sense of the word. PC is fine, so those with HTPC wouldn't mind. They got the price right, $14.99.  









 Not the same. Most of the aid to Israel is annual military funds, which Israel has to spend on American products. It's basically a corporate welfare. 

China's debt are USA government bonds held by the Chinese government.

Both of those amounts aren't that significant relative to the 100% (USA total aid, USA total budget, USA total debt, Israel budget, China total assets, you name it), but they make good headlines.

 I'd like to add, in addition to response you got from /u/dragontamer5788, that if you do want to use leverage, it's better to leverage the entire account. Meaning, if you hold $10K in double leverage ETF, it's better to hold $20K in the underlying ETF and use half of it as leverage from the broker. 

Margin rates are extremely low now and you won't suffer from beta decay that was explained to you.

Overall, leverage ETFs are bad for long time holding periods. The last few years weren't a good example because the market didn't suffer a lot of volatility, but don't think this condition will last forever nor will you able to know in time when it changes. 









 3 points to think about: 1. Did you shift gears fully? Sometimes half shift causes noise. 2. Are you cross chaining (small ring to small ring or big ring to big ring)? That also can cause some noise. 3. If not half shift and not cross chaining, go to LBS to adjust the gears or do it at home if you have the tools. 




 Yeah, you are right, this is by no means accurate, just something to know as a general guidance. The link between training, calories and weight loss is also non linear. Meaning, training and eating to lose the 100th kg is different than the 70th kg.

 Two options: either use [GPS](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/gps) with dedicated software or use an app if you have smartphone.

The advantage of apps are social (even if you don't like sharing stuff with friends, you can browse and discover lots of routes), nice websites and no need for another device to buy and carry. The disadvantage is that you depend on your phone and its battery. Unlike GPS devices, it probably won't last 5-6 hours unless it's new or you carry an extra portable charger.

If you want to make a bet, then Strava and Endomondo are really good for it, because you can actually challenge your friends and you can see the progress.
 




 From 2009, interview with Larry King:

 **MAHER**: Well, we've talked about it. I'm not into western medicine. That to me is a complete scare tactic. It just shows you, you can...

 **KING**: You mean you don't get a -- you don't get a flu shot?

 **MAHER**: A flu shot is the worst thing you can do.

 **KING**: Why? MAHER: Because it's got -- it's got mercury.

 **KING**: It prevents flu.

 **MAHER**: It doesn't prevent. First of all, that's...

 **KING**: I haven't had the flu in 25 years since I've been taking a flu shot.

 **MAHER**: Well, I hate to tell you, Larry, but if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there's ten times the likelihood that you'll get Alzheimer's disease. I would stop getting your...

 **KING**: What did you say?

 **MAHER**: That went better in rehearsal but it was still good. Absolutely, no the defense against disease is to have a strong immune system. A flu shot just compromises your immune system.

 **KING**: So you don't take any western medicine, don't take an aspirin?

 **MAHER**: Never, an aspirin no. Thousands of people die from aspirin every year.

I also think that western medicine and health practice does a lot of things wrong, but flu vax isn't one of them. He's being stupid here.
 




 I don't know, I think they went too hard on it using all the practices we all hate about business: lobbying, campaigning, lots of money.

I don't think GMO should be labeled, but I also don't see too much harm in it. Especially if virtually all food products will be labeled. It can be like ingredients. Salt isn't bad, but it's still written on the label. If someone wants to control their salt diet, he pays attention while most people don't give a fuck about that.

It's already labeled around the world in the EU and most of the developed countries. [EU: Traceability and labelling of GMOs](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l21170_en.htm). 




 Good job man. I say keep track of your nutrition. 

Since you like riding long distances and also, if I get it correctly, want to lose weight, it's important to balance your diet. Consuming too little calories while training will increase the chances of fatigue and illness. 

At your pace (20 km/h), you'll burn about 8 calories per kg per hour. So if you weight 80kg and ride 4 hours, that would be 8x80x4 = 2,560 cal. If you want to lose weight, consume 20% less, so about 500 cal less. But try not to get less than that, so you can keep healthy.

If you want to lose half a kilo per week (which is what considered an healthy diet), you would need to consume 3,500 calories less than you burn over the course of the **week**.

Obviously those numbers are just for guidelines and it depends on a lot of other factors. It can still give you general estimation. 




 /r/rage! 




 I think it backfires when those companies fight to not write GMO on the label. People don't trust businesses who try to hide things. So anti-big-businesses stand will be to immediately question GMO. This is, more than anything, a pavlovian response. 




 He's not 100% anti vax. He said he's anti the flu shot. He also brings some arguments about the downside of vax. However, you are still right, his argument aren't really backed by science.

I think his anti vax position is the same as others so-called rich liberal hippies, who used to think it's cool and healthy, only to wake up one morning and see who else support their ideas. At this point it's just a matter of time until they find a ladder to climb down from their stupid tree. 




 Nah, he withdrew that statement. He said he was libertarian when they were the only politicians that talked about weeds.

 Damn seeing people and their privileges.  




 You are right, I wasn't clear enough and I probably used the wrong terminology out of a hurry. Allow me to clarify.

**Economic efficiency**

If you were a young musician living in rural Wisconsin, it was almost impossible for you to get young listeners in Cleveland, Belgium, Australia, Hong Kong or Slovakia to hear your music and pay for it.

There were too many gates and too few competitive gate keepers between the artists and the consumer.

Therefor supply couldn't meet the real demand. And because of that, all the process in the middle and all the prices and compensations were distorted. 

(The other way around, from Australia, Hong Kong, Slovakia, Belgium **to** USA, was almost non existent). 

First you had to find a record company. Why? because printing vinyl records or compact disks is damn expensive. Distributing them is also expensive. Distributing where? to physical music stores, which also didn't exist abundantly in some markets or were under monopoly in other markets. Those stores also had limited space. How would the consumer even hear your music? The only option was radio and TV. In most of the world there were at best 2-3 variety channels, so the time you had to listen to **your** kind of music was probably 2-3 hours a week (This Top of the Pops and Radio1 in Britain, other places were even worst), that's it. So in the process you had to pass a Label, which held most of the power over you, then radio channel editor and a store manager with limited space. 

That means that everything in the middle: recording, printing, distrusting, art, stores, radio and TV - all were able to manipulate prices, not based on the music, but based on inefficient market conditions.

The market for independent musicians, those who complain today about high fees from iTunes, Google or Spotify, simply didn't exist (or was very minor) just 2 decades back.

By the way, even very successful artists would have killed for 30% flat fee on their sales. Out of $10 LP or $15 CD, artists [received $2 at best](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml). Only today you have an option to independently save up $25,000 (it's expensive, but competitive and not unheard of amount), record your first album, mix the music on your computer, put it on youtube, spotify, soundcould, bandcamp, itunes, and earn net 70% of the sales. A direct connection between you and the listener. Almost no gates and no gate keepers. So you get very closely to what you worth in the world. 




 2 points about your quotes and 1 hard truth.

1. The artist says: shirt? No thanks. But he doesn't give any reason for that. Is selling a shirt too low for him? When it comes to music, merchandise are a way for fans to express their love and connection with the music. It's a service to fans, and one that pays back.

2. 'Apple charging 30% and not taking any risks'. That's false. Apple took huge risks in the past to get to this point today. They invested large amount of money in platform and devices way before they were common and far from being a safe bet. Technology works in a way that first you take all the risks, then, if you are one of the very few successful survivors, you get big profit and big margins. 

And to the hard truth: making music isn't that special. There are tons of good artists, they all have access now to mass audience, so the competition is tough.

There's really no reason to pay for something that exists abundantly. The old market wasn't efficient because record companies created artificial scarcity.  

If you are a small band, and you make good music, you are offering something that is offered by thousands more. Why would someone pay you premium for that, when the limited resource here is the time to listen to all the good music available.

 How about Moneyball?

http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball

*Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis'sMoneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.*

Probably not. As much as those episodes have high production value compared to TV, it's still not close to a film. For example, the budget of The Imitation Game was about $15M.

 Cereal bars usually aren't good enough because it takes time for them to digest and deliver calories to your body. Fruits and drinks are quicker and more efficient in that regard.

Overall, you should aim to consume about 150-200 calories per hour, depending on your pace. 1 banana will give you about 120 cal.

If you want to eat something more solid, like a sandwich (PB J will give you about 200 cal, depending on the bread), do it as part of a full 20-30 minutes stop.

**Basic recipe for home made drink**: mix 1/3 cup of your favorite juice (orange, apple, cranberry and such), 4 tablespoon of sugar (should be around 60g), 1/4 teaspoon of salt with water to fill up 1L. That should give you around 250 calories per Liter, which is the recommended amount.

 I also like the opposite, when people upset their favorite thing isn't a thing. 




 Those you didn't find I quickly recorded before I posted! and in a serious note, I got the list from allmusic.com 




 So when are you stepping down as the mod of /r/editingandlayout?  




 I used Astrill VPN, and it connected automatically after log in, no need to enter user/password (just once, and click "remember"). 




 I'm pretty sure she's psychology professor, not psychiatrist. Your point still stands though. 




 Thanks MVP. 




 Following this logic, we can legalize any assault or even murder on private property. 

 Without daddy government to protect ~~her~~ him, a ~~girl~~ man would absolutely not enter a private room with a man ~~s~~he doesnt know or trust unless ~~s~~he is absolutely sure ~~she is ready to sleep with him~~ he won't kill him. Consent is now achieved when ~~s~~he passes underneath the rooms door frame, because ~~s~~he knows that that man can legally do anything he wants to ~~her~~ him when it comes to ~~sex~~ his body. Bad encounters are sure to occur, but these can be learning experiences for the poorly trained ~~wo~~man so ~~s~~he can better identify in the future the type of good man who will treat her like the ~~delicate flower that she believes she is~~ human being that he believes he is. After only one such sour experience, ~~s~~he will actually want to get fully acquainted with a man for longer than two hoursperhaps even demanding to meet his parentsinstead of letting a beer chug prevent ~~her~~ him from making the correct decisions to protect ~~her~~ his body. 




 I wanted to add YouTube search links, but the msg becomes too long. Here are as many link as I can. By the way, there are some few duplications (about 10), but it's really not a contest so I'm okay with leaving them.

 I play two games that have something that might be overkill, and they both have the same mechanics. In Dragon Age: Inquisition there are Focus skills and in Path of Exile there are Vaal skills. In both games you basically need to kill enemies to charge those skills (in DA:I the more you kill, the more powerful the skill becomes, up to 3 stages). When the skill is charged you can use it once, and needs to recharge it again. 

Overall I think it's a good mechanic that add some depth and tactic to the game. POE is ARPG so the skill get charged quickly, but in DA:I you need to be a bit more calculated if you want it available to a boss fight. 




 God damn it. 




 /r/lewronggeneration might also like it. 




 I think you miss the point a little. Of course he can do it. But it's more risky. Meaning, if he does it a 100 different times, he'll fall 1-2 times and lose the stage. Hell, some of them even fall in roundabouts. Don't they know how to make a simple circle? of course they do, but it's more risky. So the question is: Is sidewalk hopping a good practice from risk/reward perspective?  









 Overdone. 




 This is why I liked living in a busy street in NYC. The UPS truck arrived around the same time every day, parked in the same spot, and it took them about 20-30 minutes to deliver all the packages. So I had plenty of time to just approach the truck with the slip they left on the door (of the building!) and get my stuff. 




 Thanks. I thought it was certain that carbon frame can't be held by the frame. When I bought my car roof mount I was also told that by the seller. 




 Sarah Silverman is one of the best things that happened to comedy in the past decade.  




 Correct. That's why [countries with dictatorship](http://www.ranker.com/list/countries-ruled-by-dictatorship/reference), in which people don't value democracy and personal freedom, are ranked at the top of every category and basically live a rich, happy and worry-free life.
