 Do you think HBO is going to let him do that? I'm not sure. But I sure hope. So many of John Oliver's most important topics is exactly what Bernie wants to talk about. 




 Yes that's right. Still more than the entry-level pay of most jobs.
Parental leave in Sweden is pretty sweet. 




 I'm being serious..  




 Just Do It...

No, wait. That's not Visa. 




 People using the imperial system. 




 It sure as hell is a pretty extravagant income. Remember, you already payed for school, medical care and a lot of other stuff with your income taxes, so those 4300$ a month is only for living. 




 When my z-5500 died it was just the fuse. You probably have checked it already, but make sure to do if you haven't. Would have saved me a lot of time if I had found it first.. Good luck. 




 Hi! I wonder if anyone out there has any experiences in old radios and how to get them working again?

It's an old swedish model, I found information about it on this site: http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/luxor_r192b.html

I found it at my grandfather's summer house and wonder if there are any way of getting it to work?

As of now I believe the only thing missing are the two batteries.

Thanks in advance. 




 Of course it's not going to be even. Not on elite levels where physical strength is going to be vital. 

But a fucking high school match game? In that skill level there are lots of girls that could play the shit out of boys in soccer.  




 It's so simple. Ask the two girls: "Do you WANT to play against the boys?"

If the answer is yes. Then what's the fucking problem?
It would be disrespectful not to play against them in this case.

If the answer is no, you respect them by not playing. 




 There sure were vikings in Sweden as well. My home town of about 50 people is said to have been the seat of one called "Hagwulf". And is still named Hagwulfsroom. With places around it called "burg hill" and "raven hill".

But most of the vikings known to have raided west were danes and norwegians since they were on the west side of the strait. 




 How could they not give her community service?  




 He's so fucking mean. I frickin' love him. If you don't appreciate the humor of him or Rudy. You will definitely hate the show. Also the London suburb accent and slang is awesome. 




 Yeah, he can convince voters himself. It didn't take long for me to get really interested in what he had to say. And his background and voting history reaching back to the 90's is just outstanding. 




 And a lot of them has donated money to "The Clinton Foundation".. 




 Jamies pulls off a glorious escape while Bronn does something heroic and die, dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice. 




 I think he's feeling even more Hurt now. If possible..

 Blah. Blah. Blah blah

 a-ok :) 




 Some sort of metal in the core is good for the electromagnetic field though. No? 




 Nice, that's a beast! I had a little problem with IR as well. Never used it before.

So, I wanted to make a version of Serenity in KSP with as few mods as possible. And after two hours of building and refining this is the first version that I was able to land with, without experiencing a rapid unscheduled disassembly.

I wanted to share it and I hope it inspire someone to make a better version. I'm a rookie when it comes to replicas and building stuff for fun in KSP and I know there are really talented engineers out there.

edit: Oh, and don't forget to turn on unlimited fuel and monopropellant. 




 "It's too expensive to turn away from fossil fuels".... 




 Also it kills White Walkers. 




 The system and the economy as it is makes 99+ % of the new income go to the top wealthiest 1% of the people.

Bernie want's to raise taxes for the very rich to get funding to pay for the new infrastructure that could generate more than 10 million jobs.

As well as pay for college and healthcare. 




 It really is. This studio version has a translation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_UagTUwAt4

I think Miss Li is crying because she is moved by the lyrics, and also the participation of the audience that is breathtaking at Lars's concerts. 




 Same here. And later from 10k to about 6. 




 I'm sure he doesn't want to affect ordinary people with this. Have to ask him what transactions are gonna be taxed. Because I'm fairly certain only big wall street firms are the targets.

 




 It's a 0.01 tax. It's not gonna amount to much if you don't trade in hundreds of thousands. Millions of dollars.  




 Yeah. 0.01 tax on sales will be a huge blow.... 




 Yes. For the people. How will 0.5% tax on big Wall Street taxation affect you? 
You will get free college education. That's how you will get affected.  




 Maybe because some Americans believe college tuition can be nearly "free" as in a lot of other major countries?  




 The money in politics.  




 It is your privilege in a representative democracy. If you don't vote you don't care.  




 He hasn't taken money from corporations or millionaires/billionaires. EVER. 

And his voting record speaks for itself. He votes and introduces legislations that align with what he says.  




 Join in at /r/SandersForPresident  




 He voted against it from the start.  




 Someone got berned.  




 Alright. Interesting. Do you think he would name Warren, or is there someone else I do not know about?

In any case I think Warren will run for POTUS in 2020. And if Bernie doesn't reach all the way she can pick up the momentum his campaign is sure to get. 




 Swedish dude here, and I feel the same. The integrity of this man resonance across the Atlantic. I hope Swedish media will begin reporting on his politics when the debates start. 




 Kul med en annan svensk som tagit upp intresse fr amerikansk politik i och med Sanders.

I'd say he lines up good with the swedish Center and the Environmental Party. The American right wing is so far right we can't even see it on the political spectrum in Sweden. 
Although Sanders is fighting to introduce legislations and systems that has been in place in Sweden for many, many years (public healthcare payed for by everyone through taxes, and free education tuitions)
 




 I am pretty out of touch with American politics, but Elizabeth Warren and Bernie is on the same page more often than not. 
If Bernie becomes POTUS Warren is most likely to become VP imo. 




 This is one of the reasons Sen. Bernard Sanders is running for president.
Billionaires think they can do whatever they want. 




 That's the spirit.. 




 Hopefully a loss against Hillary in the primaries will have paved enough way for Warren to run next term with a steadier ground to stand on. 




 No reason. But what we want is exposure and awareness. And we're not getting it from the media. 




 bern* 




 "They'll burn you alive"

"Bad way to go" 




 There should be more focus on his voting record, and practical results of those laws. The facts speak for themselves.  




 Then you should register as a democrat in the primary and vote for him so that he can get a chance to make it to the election! 




 If we had listened to Sanders, we might have avoided the economic crisis. Fat chance to see that headline in mainstream media? 









 Are we getting word out about this on other forums and subreddits and not just here on /r/sandersforpresident? 

 




 Do you think Sweden, Norway and Germany has good healthcare? They do. And that's because it's government funded and therefor directly payed by all the people in that country.

How can you say that doesn't work?  




 In Sweden the largest (as of 2014) political party is "The Social Democrats".

Social Democrat is a better word for the politics we adopt in contrast to the pure marxist socialism which we are not about. 




 To the top you go. That last bit should be the campaign slogan. He votes like he talks. And he introduces proposals to make things better.  




 For once abolish Citizen United which basically gives billionairs the right to donate hundreds of millions of dollars into the election process pretty much buying candidates. That is called Oligarchy. Look it up.  We are gonna have Hunger Games if this continue long enough..  




 I think Bernie need big names with recognizable faces to reach certain kind of people. 




 I have had the same thought about Elon Musk. I feel he is pretty neutral when it comes to politics though. And all his money are locked in Tesla and SpaceX 




 Nasa, and private space companies who are their contractors.  




 In the big AMA of I hope. It's got 8 million subscribers.. 

Should we get together and come up with some good questions?  




 John Oliver should take a look at him That would get more young people aware. 




 Sweden's biggest political party (might have gone down since the election in 2014) is called  Socialdemokraterna or "The Social Democrats".

That could be tied in with his talk of Scandinavia as an example.
Also a question: What do "I note the abscence of a qourum" mean? 




 I sent a Swedish translation. Go Bernie. 




 Nice thanks..

Oh, so 150 million total makes almost 75 million who doesn't vote. I think voters was 56% or something. 




 Only 52% of americans vote. If he could reach hefty sum of 150 million potencial voters it would be a grand slam.

Why don't more people vote by the way? 




 Why don't young people vote?
In Sweden 2014 85,8% went to vote. 
I see now only 54% voted in America.. :( 









 He's running for the democrats though? 




 He's independent. Running for the democrats because running as independent is basically impossible. 














 Sen r frgan om du gillar Roy Dotrice. Jag lskar hans upplsarrst, men det r mnga som har svrt fr det.

 What a surprise. And I thought Putin was Gandhi reborn.

 Humans are animals. Animals are our way of saying living creatures that aren't the same species as us. 




 Consider that humans share 50% of the DNA with bananas.
That makes 99% a huge difference still. 




 Because scientists uses facts derived from evidence to answer questions. I **believe** that there are alien life. But I can't prove it. 




 For the same reason a ball inside a glass sticks to the sides of the glass when you move it in a circular motion. 




 I think you would fall through the hydrogen and helium down to where pressure makes it liquid. Maybe you could swim there if you didn't mind the heat.

Oh, and I wouldn't call Brown Dwarves failed stars. I would call them extremely successful planets. 




 Before french troops found the "Rosetta Stone" in 1799 we couldn't read egyptian hieroglyphs.

I'm a layman but I'm fairly certain there are a lot of other lost languages. 




 Every answer on this sub should look like yours. 




 Yes it's possible. There are a lot of rogue planets out there, some have formed separately and some have been flung out of their parental solar systems. 




 No. They don't weigh the same. No need for more explanation. 




 The faster it grows, the more carbon it uses. 




 No they don't. The atmosphere is incredibly thick and the transition between gas and liquid are slow and the change is gradual the further down you go. Most gas giants probably have a solid core though. 




 If you're interested in this stuff, and the universe as a whole I can highly recommend you taking 10 hours to watch [Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395695/?ref_=nv_sr_1).

And I'm fairly certain others will agree. 




 Interesting thought. I'm fairly certain feelings for the sexual partner weighs in somewhere. 




 Living on the sun compared to living in empty space with no stellar bodies "nearby" would result in 66.4 seconds difference per year if I interpret Schwarzschild metric correctly.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. 




 Generally species that produces a lot of offsprings at once does not care about them as much as those who produces fewer does. For natural reason. 




 Robb married her because he was naive. He was so obviously seduced by the Westerlings and tricked into marrying Jeyne. After which Tywin is completely certain she will not bear a child because her mother is giving her moon tea in secret.

I don't think Jeyne was aware of this and her love for Robb was probably genuine. 




 No one knows when it's gonna be released.
Especially not Amazon. 




 Is there any way of watching the Sky Atlantic interviews in there when you live outside of UK? 




 Yeah. The argument is empty anyway. Those who circumcise do not do it because it's more hygienic. They use that argument to hide the real reason. Which is religion. And aesthetics....
Female circumcision is foreign for me. It is complete baloney. 




 It's not my blog. I just ran into it and thought the amount of debates was shocking. 




 I'm not american, that may be relevant to know. But Sweden had a 2 hour long debate tonight with all 8 party leaders. I think it shows a lot when some politicians try to answer the questions with a straight face and some will always try to steer the discussion in another direction.
Debates and interviews in the states often results in party leaders making a joke when asked a serious question. 




 N/A doesn't mean that there were no debate. It means they didn't have a number for that. 




 Wow! That's awesome! I really like the style!

some critique is healthy though and I thought about two things.
The horse was the only thing I noticed that wasn't great in the artistic side. 

And the dialogue wasn't spot on. Try to make it sound more like speech. People doesn't speak with perfect grammar. Especially not when there's a dragon nearby.

I wanna read the next part though!
