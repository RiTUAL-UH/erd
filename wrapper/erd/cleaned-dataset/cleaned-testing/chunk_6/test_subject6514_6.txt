 Agreed, but I think using the word 'curvy' sounds a lot nicer than 'obese'. It would be nice if everyone used curvy to describe actual body shape instead of being overweight, but it seems it's the go-to descriptor. 




 This reads like a Dr Suess book. Green eggs and hambeast? 




 Looks like an Asian ranga with some missing chromosomes

 UPDATE: [She loves it!](http://i.imgur.com/fIGJr6S.jpg) 




 Still hilarious 









 Thanks for your kind words Pickles. Too many times I've seen her sit on the floor and do her make up in the mirror on our wardrobe door! No longer :) 




 Oh, I'll try! A reaction shot would be great! 




 Thanks jen-iscool - I really hope she likes it! I bought it online from an Auction house interstate and as soon as I saw it I knew it was the one!
 




 Thanks eredd11 :) there's only one thing missing; a magnifying mirrored vanity mirror, and I've arranged for her mother to give it to her. 




 You're too kind bridget992. I'm hoping she likes it - she gets home from work in 3 hours! 




 Thank you erixxi! I couldn't have done it without everyone's advice!

 That's it! Beautiful resort. I love that it's all inclusive, too. 




 It's the fucking Catalina wine mixer
