 Eyes opened.   




 To be fair, his wife was a tech in meth lab.  So the entire thing is likely illegal.   




 To be fair he was some kind of genius that previously had a meltdown and punched the president and had failed relationships in the past.   Between that and and and the the the stuttering at his pops I don't know what else would qualify him to learn computer hacking.    

You should see what happens when he plays CoD with his mouse set to 10. 




 Pppffff as if Data is remotely coherent with his emotion and long hair chip activated. 




 It's a hair difficult to get to the door though.... 




 ALL CAPS OR IT DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH!!! 




 Solid answer 




 It may have been already scheduled.  Wait until the backlog runs out. 




 That never stopped him. 




 That was a logical speculation on my part as to why they didn't try harder.

 It still doesn't change the broad point that what the movie ended up using was the most realistic the movie had tested at the time.

 




 Goddammit reddit clowns finding this shit.   Can I not drink this coffee without a full nasal reversal?? 




 its the tankless kind that just has ugly pee salted pipes?  




 I hope not or I'm going to come kick you where the supernova don't shine.... 




 [Here is a not to scale picture](http://i.imgur.com/WzlVNI7.png) but you get the picture.  /u/JustyCreamPi3 might make it easier to visualize for you.

Edit: Fixed.  




 Can you blame us?  It feels like a 14 year old girl with PMS is CEO here.       




 what?  Did you read his post?  He wasn't going into all that...   He was speaking specifically, on their decision process of which model, out of all the ones they tried, to use.   The model they used was most scientifically accurate when compared to all the others they used. It likely had more to do with the capability of their hardware.  They didn't use super computers, like the one's scientists use, to make the fucking movie.    

He didn't say it was the most scientifically accurate that the scientific community is capable of producing.    




 as a diver the lensing is the least difficult thing for me to understand.  Same stuff happens under water, near large objects, as the water bends around them.  An object behind can look misshaped or closer/farther....   




 there will be nothing left.   




 The fact these are gone makes me really sad.  

How long until a supernova reaches earth and makes us disappear?  

It's gonna be shitty when the alpha centauri decides to shit the bed/   




 That's a pretty fucked up looking tip.  And why is the shaft larger than the tip?  




 Well /u/negaduke is entiled to his opinion.  Even if it's MOSTLY wrong.  Was I obnoxious?  Sure.  was I "SUPER" obnxious.  No.  

I was slightly obnoxios towards what was bitching over a situation the OP creates on his own.   

Whatever.  This really isn't important. 




 Lol   Ur so angry   calm down. 


Edit: you also said not to take things literally whilst taking what I said literally.  

That's twice you're contradicting yourself.


. 




 Now you're just grasping at straws.   A first world problem still denotes it is a problem of that world... the first world.  Don't be mad because your original statement was  contradictory and I called you on it.   It's okay if you're doing stupid things... when someone points it out to you, you just fix it.   

Calm down.  Wow. 




 True.  But gotta take into account that the Costner Hood came out during an economic boom and with a popular song.  Crowe hood came out during a fierce recession and with no popular songs attached. 




 Well if you're talking about a specific game, wouldn't you already know the range?  And if not asking about a specific game, why are you asking such a generalized question you know doesn't have a single answer to? 

Sounds like it's your problem and not a world problem.   

 




 It's the difference between a single unit that changes.  On a scale 1-10 the differences between, say 8 and 9, is more huge than between 16 and 17.  

You're just spreading out the percentage more.  


 




 It only works if it's set to 10 and you also have a high dpi gaming mouse with a huge polling speed.  

Otherwise.... you're just a sloppy retard set to 10. 




 I had no plans on seeing it until I read your post here....  




 Incorrect.  But agree to disagree. 









 It's pretty clear to me that no one presented him with a warrant first....therefore he had no reason to believe his life wasn't in danger... and we do have the right to life.   




 It is your right to refuse entry, if not presented with a warrant first, though..... 




 It's also a right to be free from illegal search or seizure.   He was not openly presented with a warrant prior to their entry.   So... there's that. 




 Corporate bought dem is the same as a corporate bought republican.  




 What?  This gets said in like every single thread about Pao and reddit. 




 https://www.change.org/p/alexis-ohanian-to-step-down-from-reddit-board-and-administration-fire-alexis-ohanian 




 It's easy to get your posts to the top when there aren't any others.   I think that sort of deception is a bit harder since you have to float above the other sea of users now.   Unless they have some sort of automatic karma system that can add 5000 up votes or whatever.  


Who's to know if /u/______DEADPOOL______ isnt Pao's shadow account.   She'd laugh at how she duped us into supporting her as new CEO.   /tinfoil 




 Get the super waxy off brand kind that click everytime you lift it from the construction paper. 




 Sauce 




 Listen, when /u/______DEADPOOL______ becomes CEO, you stow your attitude and just accept what he thinks is right.   Or Do you want to get shadowbanned?   


DO YOU WANNA GET SHADOWBANNED??!!



....didn't think so.   Go take a nap now.
 




 YOU FORGOT UR L AND IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TASTE.  


ehem.    




 Why is it taking so long for the trees to grow back?  In Washington our trees were back withing 5 to 10 years.  You can't even tell there was a fire there now. 




 Read the comments.  It's rich. 




 The problem with fixing congress is the lack of available candidates.  That coupled with gerrymandering means that fixing congress will take more than a couple of voting cycles.  Bernie is gonna need our help because congress will stonewall him for sure.  


People can't just vote him into office and then walk away like they did Obama. 




  Pretty disappointing honestly, that Kevin Costner make a better Robin Hood movie.

This made me laugh in a manner that was more like a duck.... than anything.    




 We dodged a bullet on that one.  Boston Oregon doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely as Portland Oregon. 

Boston Oregon feels like a donut truck exploded.  


Edit.... errrmmm just noticed I made a boston and exploded joke..... to remove or not.  Hmmmm I think I'll leave it and wait for the fallout 4.    




 If I play scary music and look at this picture, the cat appears utterly terrified.    




 Well I'm gonna upvote YOUR bad attitude!   




 As a teen male, I would have missed the important message about drugs, and just skipped straight to the ass to ass scene; where I would have then masturbated to it and not have felt ashamed afterwards.   

If I try to do that now, I feel bad until about 4:15 in the afternoon or so....   




 The point was that an analogy wasn't needed.  He already struck to the heart of the matter with a perfectly sound argument.    




 Stick a post it to your monitor that says "Brevity is the soul of wit".  Written by some dead smart dude... who wrote extremely long and boring plays.   




 That blue arrow is a real bitch.    




 No no.  What I'm saying is. Your argument was needle sharp.  Until you went with this dumb analogy.   You couldn't have made your point any sharper than you already had.   Anything else just dulled the delivery of a statement that really struck to the heart of the matter.      




 Fixing it, would be to just stop talking after the opening 1 or 2 sentences that expressed the point perfectly.   




 Is it the I-gave-up-on-the-british-accent-halfway-through-filming Kevin Costner Robin Hood, or is it Im-gonna-kill-myself-this-is-so-boring Russel Crowe Robin Hood? 




 I agree it was stealing.  And you argued the point well... until it was ruined by your cab driver analogy; which is where you lost me.   




 I'm just going to start downvoting this fucking quote, each time I see it.    




 In lollipop some devices will not fast charge while on.  




 If you have this bug, what happens when you plug the device in and then reboot?   For me it makes it work again whilst the phone is on.   But only if it's plugged in during the full restart.  Hotboot does not work only full reboot.  

If you have this bug can you try rebooting with it plugged in and report if it works?  Also which model and rom are you using? (or if you're just stock)...


Thanks guys.

Edit: oh yeah and if you're running a custom kernel let me know that too. ;-) 




 Yeah, but they don't just shoot once and then leave if there is still killing to be done. 




 Good luck to him if he has a locked down USA phone.   Especially verizon... I don't even think they have root yet.   

Just say no to locked carrier phones.   You get jammed into a 2 year contract and you can't take your phone with you or change it how you please.... so you pay for a phone you don't REALLY own.  

Fuck that shit... plenty of third party sellers have financing options... and there's always buy now pay later with paypal.  Hell, even putting the phone on a credit card is cheaper than getting jammed into a 2 year contract and having a phone you don't own.  If you can't pull off financing because your credit is maxed or bad... then you don't need to be buying premium phones and instead paying down your debt.  

If root and recovery is never achieved, the carrier and the bloatware companies continue to make money off your device even after it's fully paid and they've made back their "subsidized" loss.    




 Wow... gross dead sea turtle and I STILL wanna touch that guy's body.  Is he the lifeguard?   Time to go break up some marriages.  

 




 SEE!  If they wore a full burka then the acid would only get into their eyes.  So serves them right for not listening to the rules.    

obligatory /s for all the complete morons.   




 [Now stick your dick in it; just like Dwight Emburger!](http://oddnews.co/2014/04/07/copycat-american-pie-perv-burnt/)  




 Our entire country is broken right now. 

I'm done talking about that other stuff.  I can't really handle it because I get so mad at all the bullshit.   We can't even be honest with ourselves what the REAL numbers are.  And everyone wonders why it's all screwed up.   

It is the 5th now where I am located.  This will be the 2nd 4th of July in a row that I miss out on.  Enjoy the good food and the fireworks.   
 




 No... we took those tax cuts away.  

[And no the REAL unemployment rate is not 5.3%... its closer to 14%.  Because it doesn't take into account people that have accepted part time work or given up looking for work completely.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/07/05/why-the-real-unemployment-rate-is-higher-than-you-think/)  

So the corporations lost their Bush Tax cuts... which didn't really matter because loopholes have them paying 0 taxes.   

So they continued to enjoy a virtually tax free existance and continued to get tax money paid TO them...  All that time unemployment as been so bad for so long that the way they calculate the numbers makes it appear unemployment is going down... 

But it is not.  So the trickle down economists, the GOP, most the dems, and ANY corporate backed SuperPAC candidate can kiss my ass.    

This is all I have to say on this topic.   Have a nice day. 




 We let the chinese build one tiny island, in waters that belong to them, and look what happens.  

Dead turtles.   Hope you're happy.  

Edit: /s    for the idiots. 




 Only a naive fool would think our employment problems, after the financial collapse, has anything to do with immigration.  Especially whilst corporations are experiencing record breaking profits and enjoying a loophole tax free+tax subsidized existence.    They didn't use any of the corporate welfare we gave them to hire more people and increase wages... as they led us to believe would happen.  

 




 Thank you for your period but what's the point?    




 That was excessively verbose.  How's that right click+thesaurus working out for you?   Have you found that reddit readers are receptive to uncommon vocabulary usage?    

I appreciate what you're trying to say here, and my fuck you're brain is massive and covered in diamond gold.     




 Bad for everyone.  If there's so much money that your money is worthless, how could that possibly be a good thing? 

"Oh... dollars.   I've got a huge pile already.... just stick your pallet in with the others and enjoy your gum.  Thank you for shopping."    




 and??? 




 you get those newsmax emails too huh? 

Edit:autoincorrect and additional thought.


They aren't deciding anything.  They don't say "unemployment should be 5%" and then boom we get that.   

They just make an assessment on what the economy can handle.  Believe it or not, if we had 100 percent employment that would be bad.  Too much employment causes the economy to heat up too fast.  Thus you have massive inflation because there's too much money so it's worthless.    




 It was under Bush but it is both democrats and republicans together that did that.    




 uhhh yeah... that's why.  /s  




 She's always on defense at this point.   

That's not a campaign you can win.   

Edit: Hillary is running her campaign like it was a congressional inquiry.    




 Sorry, we already gave your money to massive corporations in the form of free tax subsidies they don't need.   




 It means people get all riled up over the national debt thinking it matters in the same way your credit card debt does.  

What matters more is revenue generation.  Which we are more than capable of providing. 




 The national debt DOES matter.  Just not in the way republican voters are taught that it does.    




 We're all in this together. I don't give a shit what party someone is in... we've gotta protect the power of the people.    




 No, I think they are acutely aware of the white-collar job sector and how the world functions.  

The problem is that they desperately wanted to believe that reddit was a bastion outside of that world.    




 I look at my gilding trophy and get pissed off now.    




 dem guerillus 




 They referenced this spider in the article actually! Was a very interesting read, ~~natural selection~~intelligent design sure is an amazing force!

FTFY 



/me fucks and covers on the way out the door.   



Edit: duck when I wanna fuck and fuck when I wanna duck.  go figure.... ima just leave it.


 




 That's too hard!  Science is easier.    




 Then why are YOU still here?    




 I do the same thing when my car reaches 6 billion degrees every summer afternoon.   

Never buy a black car. 




 Today: signing into reddit, to read about how there isn't anything to read on reddit, only to find new posts linked to old posts on reddit, and then use that make a point about nothing to read on reddit.     

My fuck it's TGIF on television and today is all the "remember when" episodes......

edit:extra comma 




 Quarantine was mandatory in the sense that it was apart if the program's protocols.    

Mandatory does not mean forced.   

In medicine, quarantine means the patient is placed within a controlled environment.   It doesn't mean the patient is imprisoned and punished.  Quarantine can be for a number of safety reasons, but can also can be to maximize effectiveness of treatment.   Quarantine has nothing to do with with the practices you see in movies and television.     

But to you, you ignorantly think it is imprisonment and punishment.  

Lets be clear; the AIDS victims knew that quarantine was apart of the program.   If they didn't want to participate in the government funded program, they had the freedom to seek treatment options on their own.   But who would do that when a program exists that is free and hugely successful?   

So, the informed individual walks into the government clinic, to avail of the free internationally participated medical program, that includes quarantine as a mandatory part of it's protocol.   

There were no guns... and no guns had ever planned on being used. Quarantine was mandatory for those who wished to be apart of the program.  It was not mandatory that every AIDS victim reports for quarantine.  The program was benefitting people so naturally they had a high, probably near 100 percent, participation rate.  Who would pass up a comfortable stay with free food, medicine, counseling, education, and other services???   Only a fool.  

But Cuba means violent oppression and quarantine means forced by men with guns!   I'm embarrassed for you.... i really am.     I don't know how many times it can be said that no one was forced, or is going to be forced,  and at no time were guns ever considered to included in this treatment program.  "Men with guns" is just irrational, doesn't exist, made up, "it could happen" nonsense that was fueled by ignorance and acceptance of propaganda.   But dude dude..... Cuba HAS TO=North Korea because Communism!   LOL. 




 Ugh.  He tells his story likes it's a PG-13 horror. 

I hope this isn't what becomes your big break... Hopefully it's something better.   




 Whatever you say, Pao. /s 




 I feed my children to child eating bowls.  




 How the fuck do any of you people get through life being scared of everything?  This isn't House M. D.;  you're not gonna almost die because your bedroom vent had a bit of rust on it or a bird pooped on the roof.  

Is it the tinfoil?  Is that what protects you from this toxic deadly world that everyone is being killed by?     









 Well, my comment was just a personal feeling really.  I don't think it's a golden comment.  

Idk.  Maybe there's more out there who are equally disturbed by all of this.  

I appreciate the support though. 


.... and stop stalking me. 




 Are you stalking me?   




 ***It is fearfully disturbing to me that mainstream IS THE FRINGE of our government.***

 Oh man.  My sides.  Thank you.  


It's been a stupid morning and I got deep belly chuckles from that.    




 And then we gets fallout for realz!   KICKASS!   




 No but my ugly suits are made in mexico.   




 Prodigy billboards.  didn't even get to name yourself... I was ksnso1e.  




 How do they get rid of her?   




 This is fucking brilliant.  I love it.  Going to facebook to repost. 




 Well if you're trying to get there eating all these damn veggies then your meals will sort of blend together into one big giant all day meal.  So you could then argue that all those 2000 calories are going into one meal.  




 I feel like I'm watching the opening credits to Napoleon Dynamite.
