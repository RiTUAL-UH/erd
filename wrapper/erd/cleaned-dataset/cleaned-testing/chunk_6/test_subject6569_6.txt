 If you include the separate category for female-on-male rape ("made to penetrate") then there were 5 times as many reported male rapes (over 8%).

Is it actually made explicit in the report whether "made to penetrate" is synonymous with 'female perpetrator' or is that your interpretation?

I'm asking since I can easily imagine both men and women raping men by forcing them to penetrate. 




 I liked E for long stretches of time, who I really hated on that show was Vince when he was coked up. Douche. 




 Got it in one. I'm Swiss! 




 The Van is labelled in German though. 




 Nice, let's get matching tattoos!

Apparently we're either super perceptive or overly suspicious. Time will tell. 




 So.. uh.. Am I the only one who thinks the font on the sign looks like it was photoshopped? 




 What???

Okay, I get that the N-word was yelled when a large part of the citizens of Duluth, MN came together and lynched three innocent black kids (and then sold [post cards](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg/300px-Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg) of the event) less than a century ago, but I was called a "fuck-up cracker" once in a traffic jam and it deeply scarred me.

 I mean, those kids are dead, but I still have to live with the knowledge that I was called a pejorative name that evolved from my ancestors' slicing open the slaves' backs with whips? For Shame! 




 Dan mentioned Jung revisiting his youth as an adult to unpack and understand it better. Can anyone explain a bit more? What were some of his findings and what were his impressions of the experience?

This is an area of Jung I'm not too knowledgeable about, keep that in mind while I give it a shot. 

Re-creating childhood memories was a strategy that C.G. Jung employed to deal with his own mid-life crisis. The whole thing started in his late thirties - a  tumultuous time for the Swiss psychiatrist, amongst other things he had just severed his connection to his erstwhile mentor Sigmund Freud (apparently not very amicably...) and he fell into a deep depression.

Now, and don't quote me on this, I think I remember reading somewhere that the whole "recreating childhood" thing started after he had a dream about his childhood play. Jung, always ready to lend significance to dreams, started to play with sand and sticks at a park on the shores of lake Zurich (about 2 miles from where I grew up, actually) on his lunch break, trying to recreate his childhood experience. 

Apparently that hunting for the archetypical symbols of his childhood prompted a period of very vivid dreams where he dreamt of mythological figures who advised him on how to move forward with his life. I think he later classified that episode of his life as psychotic, but he also said that it helped him deal with his midlife crisis. 

He wrote his experiences down and, over time, other therapists picked up on the idea - it's a form of therapy that is still being practiced today - I think it's called Jungian Sandplay Therapy or something like that.

This episode stands out as somewhat of an oddity in Jung's work - not the fact that it's about adults digging in sand, but rather that it's about reaching back to move forward, which is more of a Freudian approach. 

In general, and I'm vastly oversimplifying a complex research field here, in the rest of his body of work, Jung wasn't about looking at the past so much. 

Freud and Jung are the two most influential scholars in the field of Psychoanalysis. Freud was of the opinion that many of the conflicts people face as adults can be explained and or fixed by looking at their childhood. He though it was all about looking back.

Jung, on the other hand, looked at those same conflicts and thought they stemmed from an inability or unwillingness to reconcile with death. He was more about looking forward.

On a side note, it's not surprising that Dan likes Jung - he's a fervent Campbellian, and Joseph Campbell's Hero Journey is, for the most part, an extension of Jung's archetypes.

I like the idea of someone posting a weekly discussion thread for some of the more thought-provoking ideas that come up during the show. I say just give it a whirl and see whether people respond to it. I'll be sure to chime in if I have anything to say about that week's discussion! 




 Granted. 

OP did say though that he had a full beer in front of him when she left, and yet he caught up with her before she could reach her room which sounds to me like he made an effort to approach her again... However, I recognize that all of this is pure speculation.

What isn't speculation is that his second approach made OP uncomfortable and that the hotel clerks found his behaviour marked enough to check in with OP. 




 Following the woman up to her room after you've already said your goodbyes at the bar doesn't strike me as a particularly good thing. It's misguided at best, creepy at worst.

If by the "good thing" he did you mean that that he didn't try to force her into anything after being rejected, then your bar for goodness is pretty darn low. I'd call that the basest of human decencies. 

Regarding "OP is a scumbag wife": OP made it obvious that they're both married. So him trying to get some strange isn't scummy?

As for a partner having drinks with a stranger of the opposite sex, I guess that comes down to what you and your partner have agreed to. I've never found it troubling in my relationships, but I can understand why some couples put it on the "No-No" list.



 




 The point wasn't that he got her drunk, but *that he followed her up to her room* when she left, which, understandably, made her uncomfortable.

Naturally this doesn't make him a rapist, it seems from OP's story that he took the rejection and went away. But she felt creeped out by the episode and she has a right to be. What's awesome about this story is that the hotel employees picked up on him following her and that they then made sure she was okay. 




 I know that, what I mean is that the caveats OP laid about his pictures carry no legal weight on their own.

You know, much in the same way as writing ALL COPYRIGHT BELONG TO SONY PICTURES in the info section of a video you have ripped from a TV show and uploaded to youtube doesn't protect you from legal ramifications. 
 




  I said very clearly, that redistributing or altering in any way is forbidden, unless I have given permission and they credit me as original artist

I don't think that's legally binding, sorry to say. Even as the original artist you don't get to say what is and isn't illegal in regards to the use of your picture.

I do hope you get credited though, OP!
