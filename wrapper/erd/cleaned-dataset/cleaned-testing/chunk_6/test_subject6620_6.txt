 Cleats. I didn't have shin guards, but if you're able to play in gym shoes go for it. 




 Check out the new sub at [r/chicagopickupsoccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagopickupsoccer/) we should have the next game posted there.  




 We played small-sided 3 v. 3 at Wrightwood Park. A good time, but a bigger group next time would be great.  




 Hey can you add this to [This Thread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/2cuasb/pickup_soccer_innear_lincoln_park_meetup_is/)

A number of us from r/chicago met up at Wrightwood Park this morning to play some small sided games. We'd like for you to join us in the near future. 

u/TraptInaCommentFctry was the guy who organized today, and we'll be looking to get a bigger group together for the next one.  




 It's really hard for me to hate Fleury; in fact, it was really hard to get excited about the Hawks in the early 2000s. Like the writer of the blog, I was watching the Wolves win Turner Cups and Calder Cups during this era, and learning that Fleury was coming to the Hawks was exciting. True, he didn't perform; he was out of shape and on a bad team, not to mention that he was suicidal during his stay in Chicago. When the team is only good enough to win 30 games in a season, guys like Fleury, Sullivan, and heck even Kyle Calder provided rare bright spots in a dreary season.

Funny enough, I actually found an autographed copy of his book "Playing with Fire" in a used bookstore last night. The chapter on Chicago gives a great perspective on his performance here. I was laughing in the bookstore after reading Brian Sutter's quote. "Theo, you're in fucking horrible shape."   




 [What's that now? You tryin' to start somethin'?](http://dallascowboysdishingthereal.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bennett-bentley1.jpg) 




 Sounds good. I'll be there. 




 I'd like to play this weekend. Fields by Montrose Harbor may be open if we get there early enough. Otherwise, I would be up for playing at a field in LP. 




 Crisotbol Huet has got to be on the list of least loved Hawks. 




 That kid was actually forth in receptions on the Bears that year. 




 Not in the city, but [Ozzie's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ozzies-food-store-liquor-and-deli-melrose-park) has the greatest spicy Italian sub known to man. Doubt many of you guys will recognize the place (being in unincorporated Melrose Park); it looks like a liquor store that happens to have a deli, but the giardiniera, dressing,   meats possess the perfect remedy for sandwich craving. 




 From that era hopefully Moises Alou, Marty Booker and Stoichkov.  




 Ha. Well, I guess the shock hasn't worn off from when I heard that they were still making the Galant in 2012. 




 Mitsubishi Galant. I think it has gotten a redesign recently, but how the hell was it the same mediocre car for a decade straight? 




 and it needs FLAMES... ya know, just a little thing happened in 1871 that resulted in about 17,000 buildings being destroyed + one of the greatest rebuilding projects in American history 




 Anybody have an R.W. McQuarters out there?  




 Wow. The Dept. of Energy Building would fit right in to [the opening credits of the British version of the office](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKTvAP06ECM) 




 SCHURRLE UNLEASHED! 




 'Twas a great game against NE yesterday! 




 Andy Bezeau was a complete maniac; remember seeing him on the Vipers   Komets. I Miss the I and the old smoke filled Rosemont Horizon. 




 This way if he's to be thrown to the Wolves of the AHL, it's only a short drive to Rosemont to see the kid hone his skills 




 This is good news. At least a year in Rockford is probably necessary. I mentioned it before, but part of me worries that he has the potential to be Tony Salmelainen 2.0. Dominance in the European game doesn't always translate to the game across the pond. Really glad we have Richards for next year, and the depth to allow him to grow as a playmaker. 




 "Brad Richards and Vladimir Putin's shirtless hot tub pictures are making waves among many Americans. President Obama's official word from the white house was, "I do not approve."  




 Someday. [Just don't become the Papa John's guy;](http://www.papajohns.com/about/pj_camaro.shtm) dude is just a tad annoying. 




 Is Marty interested in being a goalie coach yet? Otherwise, no thanks. 




 Why would Saad be considered in any deal? We haven't even seen him at his best yet. He's untouchable. 




 Workaholics reference? Or, this dude us an [angry ex-tomato picker](https://twitter.com/TraitorJoes). 




 Jewel Osco definitely had a cameo in one of the car chase scenes, not sure which store location though. 




 Why wouldn't he be in a Toyota Hilux? 




 Eh. I'm more familiar with the 2011 version of Roussel, not much of an intimidator. My observation from this year was he was trying to mix it up with at smaller Andrew Shaw (5'10"/180) any chance he had, while he avoided Bollig like the plague until Bollig finally grabbed a hold of him at the end of the season. 




 Belak and Probert both left this word far too prematurely as well.  




 Unless you consider his habit of fighting guys smaller than him, and losing most fights an "enforcer." Seriously, watched this guy with the Chicago Wolves (AHL) years ago; he lost every fight. 

However, [loved the fight with Shaw this winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-SRugYRRV0); and I gained an inkling of respect for him for [his fight with Bollig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4k_JEa8IGQ) 




 The [Blood Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_eagle) form of execution has to be pretty terrible. That is, unless you'd think having your ribs broken   lungs ripped out through your back with salt sprinkled in the wounds sounds like a good time.  




 [So, DeMamp finally got a car, huh?](http://workaholics.randomblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tumblr_macuucHRNd1ruq3yto1_400.gif) 




 Yellow is for smiles? It looks like Crest Whitestrips should have been end of the year give-aways.  




 Got to love how lazy he was with the ads. Ol' Freckleface just replayed that Dollar Shave Club ad from last week. "NEXT WEEK IS FAHTHA'S DAY" ...Good one Billy Alzheimer's.  




 I'll never forget his quote from the 2013 Cup Finals.  "Look at Chara's stick. It's so big. It's so long."  




 JOSTLED! 




 I still think Patrick Kane can score in overtime.  




 It's nuts how long this went on. That TV scoreboard is hilarious. 

Reds: 0
Cubs: ?

Also you gotta love Stone's reality check about how that was a foul ball. There were times (I remember the late 90s and early 2000s) when I wanted to dislike him for criticizing Kerry Wood   the team in general, but the dude was smart and always told it like it was.  




 That is the second most recognizable Previa in the world after Khan's car from *King of the Hill.* 









 There was a time when he was one of the only positive things going for the Hawks. There were literally 10,000 at a lot of the games. I'll never forget when Ol Sullivan got a hat trick on saint Patty's dy. 




 Enjoy a New Jersey dog topped with savory toxic waste, celebrating the heritage of the Garden State which is home to more than 100 toxic waste dumps.  




 It's on par with the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Less gems, more dinosaurs. Go to the Oriental Institute at U of C if you are visiting again. Mummies + tons of ancient stuff from the Middle East. 




 First of all your idea of DC people being uptight workaholics is true. Now add politically charged to that. Thank God I'm back in Chicago where people distrust politicians enough to not wear their political views on their sleeves. 

As you probably know, DC is EXPENSIVE! Here you will never pay $4.35 for a damn train ride one way within the city. I'm not sure what neighborhood you live in, but the wife and I made more than $90k per year in DC and we had a mediocre 1BR apartment on the west end of Alexandria, VA for $1300/mo... and literally DIRT for a front lawn. Here, you will get a lot more for your money if you're a renter. No it isn't cheap (sales tax..ahhhh), but by DC standards it would be a breath of fresh air. 

Now here are my biased opinions:
 
-Chicago Art Institute  National Gallery of Art/ *any* Smithsonian Museum

-Museum of Science and Industry  Smithsonian Space whatever-the-hell-it's-called museum 

-Chicago lake front  National Mall

-Chicago hot dog  DC-3 (which has some damn good hot dogs)

-Deep dish pizza  $60 sushi roll or whatever people go out and eat in DC

-Mariano's   Jewel-Osco  Giant or Harris Teeter

-Chicago's grid system of roads  Than the 6 miles of traffic circles on Mass Ave that will take you 1.5 hours to drive down.

-Bears   Blackhawks  Racist Redskins or creatively named "Caps"

-Chinatown = Chinatown, but Chicago also has Korea town + Argyle Street (mini- SE Asia)... Get into Vietnamese subs!

-Wicker Park  H Street 

-Have to say I haven't experienced much of the Pride celebration here in Chicago (always avoided the huge crowds), but DC Pride was pretty huge, my guess is that it stacks up. 

In summary, you'll find what you're looking for here in Chicago. Move here if you can get a solid job lined up! 




 ["It's pretty amazing to see what this team has accomplished, but again there's no satisfaction here at all."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyoyDZmAPAY). No satisfying this man until he wins another cup; Toews is *the* undisputed best captain in the NHL.  




 He should have made more pie charts! 




 I was looking for this one as soon as I started reading the thread. [Plus, Kane score his first NHL goal just minutes later](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFW0jztJJrA)

 It seems like the giant open-ice hits that have generated so many injuries and suspensions in this past decade were a result of minimizing all of the clutching and grabbing that went uncalled in the past. At least my observation is that a majority of the *dirty hits* that we've come to know (mainly the ones involving a guy on a stretcher) are coming in a post 2005 NHL. 

Not to say that the 80s game wasn't full of dirty plays, just on a different level.  




 Instant. Classic. 




 DUNC! What a game!!! We're going right down to the wire.  




 Thanks for the analysis, Shaw.  









 Think you're right, but I do like the Morin suggestion; feel like he could be the sparkplug needed to get a quick goal or help set the climate for hard forechecking early on.  




 3 assists in the first 12 minutes. I would say he showed up; going to need Kane to keep razzling and dazzling for the next 170 minutes of the series.  




 Weighing in at 3500 lbs. and marketed as a "safe vehicle" (SV), I remember reading about it in "Automotive Atrocities" as a kid; also, just discovered that it is on *Time*'s  "50 Worst Cars of All Time"... but ya know, I can appreciate this lime green beast.   









 Have to go with the green alligator.  




 "The Unsolved Crime" is just downright impressive.
