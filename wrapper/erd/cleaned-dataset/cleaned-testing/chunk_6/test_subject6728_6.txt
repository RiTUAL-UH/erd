 Yes i had the same idea to have trouble while passing by in earth dawn the gate spell had a strong spirit guarding it that was better to run by then defeat the same could apply to this but things that you run into while reaching your destination.

I mean shape change as in metagamic kind of thing shapeshift into a sentient puddle or turn your fist intl solid metal and stuff of thr like the same i have thougbt about the character loosing his sense of identity nothing like trying to change sex and critical glitch i would maybe make it so when you glitch either the spell warps or you are stuck with what you tried to change into for a while even alien hand syndrome if applicable.
I'm typing all of this on my phone so sorry for the grammar. 




 I thought about that maybe if the character was an older infected that took his training seriously would have to train for how many mny years i know harlequin did but when it comes to immortal elves well...im not that well versed on them snd people tell me to just ignor that 




 For Teleport i had the idea for the mage to shift to astral space and get materialize in another place maybe available at high initiation maybe 7-9?

Shapshifting also more than shapechange i'm talking body parts and such.

and finally phasing turn etheral for a moment just dematerializing like a spirit would.

post how would you make them not broken. 




 spells that you created and found it really useful. 




 Well apart from the fluff and character

I see most people that understand a bit about min-maxing actually go for mages

what i feel is that they try to make magic so balanced it looses the element of "magic" of it.

and i think that's a debate that's going for a long time chrome vs mana

which i am not the person to answer it but this thread would be enlightning 




 As a magic character what was the biggest magical feat you have performed and how did it turn out? 




 Thanks i missed that. 




 Assuming that they keep feeding regularly.
since vampires of old were considered ageless if they kept feeding.
didn't find anything on that. 




 Heavily magic character lacking in alot of other things to boost magic and might be infected with hmhvv while also being very frail so i thought of elric and though that stormbringer would be a nice addition and perhaps be a possible plot point for the gm 




 Am is readind this right? A mage that follows a tradition wich dosent have water spirits cannot summon such a type? What a bummer what about shedim and such i know some mages can summon them or did i misread that too?
