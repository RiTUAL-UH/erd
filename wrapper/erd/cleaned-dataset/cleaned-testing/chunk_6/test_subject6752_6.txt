 Is it a pocket door that slides into the wall? I have the same lock on a door like that in my bathroom. 




 And that reason was...? 




 Now who is reading too much into something? All I stated was that there a different cultural norms for military people and antimilitary people and between straight people and gay people, for gay people who are involved in gay culture. I never called you violent. You seem to have your jimmies rustled about this. I'll let you go, but maybe chill out and bother to read.

Edit: if you're offended that I saw your post history, stop commenting completely. Its public. 




 A quick glance through your history shows that you are a straight Navy wife. I'm an anti-military lesbian. Totally different cultural norms there. 

I'm saying that I feel downtowns were justified for unnecessary violent feelings. I also feel that you aren't the Reddit police and people are free to downvote even if you disagree with them. 




 That user implied that it was problematic. A lot of users here left twox in favor of this sub as well. 




 I personally think it's rude and wrong to desire to burn the faces of people who are concerned for you, but I guess cultural differences and all that. 




 He's being downvoted for desiring violence over someone showing concern. 




 Well it's bullshit to compare sister people, so yeah. 




 But social media like Reddit is different? 




 Blowjobs. 




 What if I told you adults can feel guilty about their choices? 




 I got you. I also can't stand Josh from work. He's just awful. 









 A mother? A sister? A friend? I have asked my dad, brother, and male friends to help in menstruation situations before. 




 I love U by Kotex. Periods suck. At least with their line I get pretty packaging and products and it really helps destigmatize something that shouldn't be stigmatized at all. It's surprisingly less embarrassing to whip out a bright purple tampon package than the awkward white one's of other brands. 




 I'm not trying to hurt feelings, but if saying "present" or "here" first really scares you, please see a doctor. It could be anxiety or even hypoglycemia. Your body does weird things and that's a bit excessive. Please seek help. 




 It actually just takes a quick trip to the SSA nearest you and then wait for your licence for when It gets renewed.  




 I hate hyphenated names but don't care if a man takes his lady's name. I just find it unnecessarily long winded and more difficult to spell. Also, if it becomes like a family thing to hyphenate then you have great grand children with like 50 letters in their last name. Try writing that at age 5! That's why my wife and I didn't hyphenate but it doesn't really affect me if other people do. 

Edit: when we went for our marriage licence it was also explained to us that getting Social Security when you are old can be difficult with a hyphen and that paperwork gets weird. They suggested that we either pick one name or each keep our own. 




 When my wife and I got married her mom flipped shit that she wasn't hyphenating. You can't please anyone. 




 It was just a joke. There are only two or three instances of males with Down syndrome fathering children in recorded history.  




 Down syndrome.

 I got banned from feminism for no reason. They wouldn't even tell me why. I'm actually a feminist. 




 I'm not stigmatizing adoption. I have two adopted siblings and will soon be an adopted parent. Young children understand that sometimes parents stretch the truth and tell lies to make people feel good. If one of their siblings is given away, they will certainly fear it for themselves and it will cause a powerful distrust of their parents. The other child will also have self esteem issues once they find out. 




 Dude. How would he explain adoption to his kids? Mommy gets huge but this baby isn't worth keeping? It would scare them into thinking they were next. When the kid grew up and all but inevitably found out, they'd also be fucked up that they, the third kid of happily married parents, wasn't worth keeping. That's really not a workable option. 




 Don't come up these stairs! I wish I had a step right here right now I'd step all over it! 




 I have a 20 year old self. It's also trash and toys  




 So we should also lock children up? They flail and could hurt someone, especially another kid or a baby. Most mentally ill people are not and do not need to be hospitalized. Do some research and have some compassion. 




 Not conforming to them doesn't mean they don't exist. I don't conform to American military worship, that doesn't make me not an American. 




 If you haven't used it, maybe you guys could trade! 




 You can't really not believe in them. It's not Santa; your belief isn't required. A telephone pole is also a societal construct but it's still real. Same goes for traffic laws. Disliking it doesn't make it not exist. 




 So at least approximately 20+ years. Possibly longer as many Republicans and Democrats don't want Hillary and would fight her being on the currency, and she is the only person with potential to be a female president at this time. Why should a female have to do more than Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton to be on there? It hurts no one to switch it to her over Jackson. 




 Still a good excuse to eat ice cream and wine for every meal. 




 About the hair thing. I was never allowed to cut mine. I chopped almost all of it off at about 16 and had it buzzed by 18. Once it's off she can't do anything, and it's not like hair places card. Go to a Wal-Mart or something with a specific pic and specify that you do not want it feminized. 




 Soooooo many servers walk away as soon as the first extra is requested. I will send you on all 274626 trips I need if you can't wait half a second for me to finish talking. 




 Monica wasn't Bill's first time straying. I'm willing to bet it wasn't his last, either. 




 Though, in the 90s and even now, it wouldn't be acceptable politically. 




 Dollar coins are useless. No where to put them in a drawer and too easily confused with quarters. What you are saying is that women shouldn't be mainstream the same as men in regards to currency. Why can't or shouldn't we update the money to include other, female, historical figures? 




 I speculate that she doesn't care that he's a cheater. It's the modern world; divorce is okay. They have strength in each other politically though, and they both have their girlfriends on the side, so no one is upset, except Monica and whiny people.  














 "Because rich people have a drug problem; a cocaine problem. Poor people are lowly addicts; crackheads and tweakers." - my college sociology professor. 




 I'm a Social Work major. I was commenting on the typical Reddit circlejerk about STEM degrees. 




 There is a huge variety between penis and clitoral sizes. That doesn't change a persons sex or gender, that was my point. 

Why is consistency so important?  




 Why? They are there to see as well. They also are genetic females, not genetic women. Some people not passing doesn't mean that no people pass. Actually, a vast majority of transmen pass with ease. 




 The problem is that it isn't a STEM degree. Those are the only degrees worth getting, you know. 




 I should have said that your gender directly relates to your gender presentation, which is how you are viewed. Sex also isn't consistent. There are intersex people. Where is the line between macroclitoris and micropenis? No two vulvas look the same, so are not all vulvas female vulvas? 




 You can't use a unisex toilet? Are you sure you aren't the one with a disorder? 




 People without penises can use urinals. There are stand-to-pee devices and things like Go-Girls. Some vulva having people can also per standing and aim well, though that is rare. Women are allowed to see urinals as well. It isn't against the rules. 




 Do you tell strangers your blood type? Do you tell them that you are a carrier for Tay-Sachs or any other genetic disorder? No, you don't, and you don't have to announce your sex by walking into a gendered bathroom. 




 Gender is what other people see. It's how you are socially categorized. 




 So why do we have to remove the urinal? Women can see them you know. 




 No you treat them with hormones, just like you do transpeople. The only proven, effective treatment for transpeople is transition. 




 Not really. It's no one besides you, your partner, and your doctor's business what your sex is. It doesn't matter for your employer or for a bathroom. What matters there is your gender. Gender is hardwired into the brain and has nothing to do with stereotypes. Plenty of transpeople are gay and behave in a role closer to their assigned sex. Many cisgender people are butch lesbians or feminine gay men, but that has nothing to do with their gender. 




 Close. Gender roles are a social construct. Gender is hardwired into the brain. 




 An "SJW" degree is a degree in Social Work. It's a very marketable degree. 




 Sex is in your pants, orientation is in your heart, gender is in your head. 

 




 Yeah! Him and his personal vendetta against rain barrels! 




 Literally only useful for babies. Even if the baby isn't yours, it's content to sleep on them.  




 Doesn't help.  




 Vaginal. 




 They just shove their fingers in. It's deaf privilege. 




 Thanks for the assumption and shitty source! I've actually only had one partner and she's a woman. 




 To fertilize the egg the partner has to be recent, as in within the week. 




 Well. I think you need to go circlejerk back on TRP. 




 I have a younger brother. I am more than willing to share, but keep your damn hands off my food unless I okay it. I've recently observed that youngest children lack sharing issues like that but they also lack the respect of keeping their hands off other people's stuff. Obviously not all youngest children, but many in my experience. 




 What is your preference for yourself? Partners? Is it a deal breaker or are you flexible? Any particular reason? Awkward conversation stories? 




 She's also judgemental if it wasn't clear from this. She posts in FPH. 




 No death threats were made here. 




 I hang out with my mom a lot. It's good because I love being close to her, but it's hard. She's almost 60 and has a lot of medical problems. It means that my best friend is dying and it's terrifying. I also spend a lot of time with my wife.  




 Whynonynonym! 




 And she'll have a great physical memento of her youth! Pretty cool, huh? It's almost like no one gets sexier between 60 and 80! 




 One pic had them kissing. It's pretty easy to trip and fall onto that conclusion. No jumping required. 




 I'm sorry. I worded that poorly. I have two adopted brothers. I'm extremely grateful for biomoms who give up their kids so they can have a good life. I don't believe they are bad people or anything like that. I meant that, on a subconscious level, you may feel that she didn't love you and it may make it harder for you to trust her. Obviously she loved you or she wouldn't have had the courage to give you up to your family. 




 You trust your parents to love you no matter what. She already, to some degree on a subconscious level, betrayed that by giving you up and you don't have that trust. That's probably why you are scared. 

She wants to meet you. The real you. She has no rights to expectations on who or what you are. You want to meet the real her. For this relationship to work, you have to learn to appreciate one another, warts and all.  




 I don't even have a dick and that sounds great. 




 And literally anyone over age 7 can do it, physically speaking. A mother or father is no longer needed. 




 I can read music and I can read tab but I struggle to read chords and it would be much easier for me to be able to play from tab, but I can only really find chord charts online. Am I not going to the right places or is it not typically done to write ukulele tab?

 It's a slow progression and doesn't require hardcore focus. It's so good! You can pick up anywhere and within three minutes know what's going on. 




 The store got the money to give them away from somewhere. That somewhere is other customer purchases.  




 That's exactly what happens! The samples are free to you because the other customers pay for it by buying from the company.  




 That's still free. He didn't pay for it; it was free to him. That's like saying free samples aren't free because the company paid for it. 




 Back them up. Accidents happen and technology glitches. 




 My wife's grandmother and aunts and uncles are all Witnesses on her dad's side. They are so sweet. I absolutely love being around them. Maybe they don't preach since we are gay. 




 Why ask questions if you don't actually want an answer? Go back to neckbearding over on r/atheism if you aren't capable of discussion. 




 Disclaimer: this is my personal experience and it certainly varies by person and location.

The only reason a person who makes too much for SNAP to have an empty refrigerator is wasteful spending. My wife and I finally broke down and applied and were called that day because we qualified for expedited food stamps to the tune of 300 just for the two of us. We had no idea we were that poor. Prior to this, we were still eating every day. It was pasta and shitty sauce, but It was food. I do taxes for my family. Last year, my parents made 25,000. My mom hasn't applied for SNAP, though I can't figure out why, but no one goes hungry of them, my brother, his girlfriend, and what they do to supplement my wife and I now that we moved back in with them. It's about budgeting, which everyone has to do. When I was receiving SNAP, if we wanted to eat something besides pasta, we had to work to stretch that money. Yes, the day we got it, we had a full fridge, but the day before we had almost nothing.  




 I feel like Mux is awful. It's like muck and it makes me think of the phrase "[he] mucks everything up." That's just me, though, so if that's the word, that's the word. 




 Maybe God wanted them to wait longer and had them need to use IVF and it was God's will that IVF and the doctors existed all along.  




 Try to find an LCSW. (Licenced Clinical Social Worker) I believe in some places they can do both. Check for your area. 




 To be fair, the surgery and IVF aren't fool proof, they still fail. They are probably thanking God that it worked. 

Edit: I'm not saying they got pregnant because of God. I'm saying that people who thank God are thankful that He allowed the procedures to work. 




 The thing is, people aren't thanking God for swooping in and saving them. They are thanking God for putting the right people (you) in the right places at the right times and them saving them. They believe that God gave you the gifts of desire and ability to help them. The belief is not that you were there by your own volition, but by appointment from God. Helpers are viewed as special in the eye of God to people who thank God for things like this, surviving surgery, someone showing up to help change a flat, etc. It isn't meant as a slight against you. 




 Plot twist; the nanny is named Mary and her Nick name is now mama. 




 I found that helmet on clearance at Wal-Mart and forced it onto my massive head for a selfie. I wish I bought it. 




 You can't have open containers of alcohol in your vehicle. It's a danger to other people. Your friends broke the law, despite how you feel about that law, and they deserved to be punished. They knew the potential consequences. 




 For having it in their cars they should be. You don't sit in your driveway and get high. That's like being missed about probation for empty beer bottles in your car. 




 That is clever!

 Not at all. People with AIDS are living full or near full life spans. We are just this side of a cure. A vast majority of people with it also try very hard not  to spread it around. They also don't die alone.

Edit: you might he talking about when AIDS first started. If so, I'm sorry, then you are correct other than the fact that 10 years is exceptionally long.

 My wife has PCOS and we've never used protection. I'm not too worried though since we're gay. 




 Yeah, I don't want my mom or wife to have to identify me all fucked up. At least if I didn't skid the pavement with my face they don't have to see that. 




 Good on your for apologizing dude! 




 Plenty of women like anal though  




 Don't let it. It's a chance to grow and change. You never know, you could end up back together. My father in law remarried his second wife two years ago, after 12 years of divorce. My uncle left a horrible woman and his second wife is his soul mate. Try to be happy at changes. When they say days drag and years fly it's because the days are all the same. Let the change surround you and let it motivate you, if you can. Continue to seek support where you see fit. A divorce is a huge undertaking. Don't be afraid to talk about it. Best wishes.

 Grandma, calm down, work boots are in style, I'm sure the "thugs" took them. 




 I doubt that. You still have to meet with caseworkers, you still have to have a place for people without online access. They help with translations, hold hearings for disputes on welfare and provide phones for calling caseworkers if you don't have one. I don't live in Maryland, but I doubt it's much different elsewhere.
