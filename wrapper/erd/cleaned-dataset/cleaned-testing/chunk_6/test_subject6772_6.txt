 Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.

But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.

Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).

I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.
 




 As stated above:

Primary purpose of this bot is used to cross-reference subs commonly associated with SJWs, in addition to finding patterns in the subs left-wing users use. Uses are for identifying concern trolls, potentially identifying alts, identifying cuckolds so that one may talk to their SOs for bulltastic times , and just fun and curiousity.

 **Duggar cached website: "Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes"**

Q. What is your abortion position, and specifically, where do you stand on rape, incest, and threat to the mothers health?

A. If a woman is raped, the rapist should be executed instead of the innocent unborn baby. Adoption is an option. Many couples would love to adopt and are waiting for a baby. Abortion has been and always will be the destruction of an innocent child. Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes. The developing infant committed no crime and should be allowed to live. In the unlikely event that the life of both mother and baby would both be lost (for example, a tubal pregnancy) all should be done to save the life of the mother.

 Maybe because they banned it first over spam, relented, then looked at what it said it's stated purpose was - which wasn't spam. Part of it's 'purpose' was to gather information to use to contact the SO's of people on it's list.

That isn't spam. That is harassment.  




 I was pegged by that bot. I mostly post in politics and news (sometimes star wars).

If you want to know why the bot was banned maybe you should take a look at the description the bot had and not it's function. There is a telling item in it and it's stated purpose. 




 Is he related to the Duggars? 




 **Puts on tea party/rw fundie hat**

We better give them what they want. If we don't, god won't bless the USA and will strike us down. If you don't believe us, ask our super smart members to explain to you folks where hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, droughts, etc come from - God..he is punishing us for gays. 

Elect us and god will bless us again as we give Israel anything it wants, drive out the gays and immigrants, end all aid to the poor, sick, hungry, and make life hell for those in prison - just like Jeebus demanded we do! 









 **Puts on conservative hat** 

You all need to pull yourselves up by your bootstraps. Just work harder, get two jobs! Why should I give you welfare? Don't like where you are living? Move somewhere else with better opportunities and less violence. Git r done! 









 How about we just quit getting in to wars in the first place. Problem solved. 




 And you don't get to assault citizens. Fair enough. Now let's look at what happens when either group do so. 




 Ah, Rick and the conservative platform: Save america from hurricanes, floods, etc - ban gays and push prayer as the solution to poverty, healthcare, everything except defense (for that, they don't put trust in god but in ammo - god can wipe out sinners/gays with 'natural' disasters but he is powerless against terrorism, russia, china, etc. Man..their god is weird). 




 Internet troll eh. Let me guess, he is a conservative.  *Checks article*

Yep.  *after asking for funds to "take out" the civil rights activist DeRay McKesson* 














 Yes. How many people speed per day? Do you want to hire enough cops to sit at every mile marker to catch them all? It is gonna cost more - and we know the conservatives in this country would only raise taxes for killing humans in other countries, so how would we pay for properly enforcing the law? 




 Funny, an NDN I know who is a SJW and an attorney on a rez sent this to me. If she isn't offended I'll try not to be. 

















































 All religions are just things people made up to make themselves feel better and/or a method to control people. It's all about fear - fear satan, fear god, fear muslims, fear people not like us (color/sex/etc).

Islam and Christianity are just two branches of the same tree that peddle fear and ignorance of others to justify their actions. Cut down the tree if you ever really want to get some real peace on earth. 




 Demographics: Citizens with guns shooting other citizens.

Since we don't pay citizens and they don't work for us there isn't really much we can do about it other than what we already are. If the people we employ are shooting folks there is a lot more we are empowered to do about it.

Can't control everyone else, but the people who are supposed to answer to us we should be able to. Oddly enough, conservatives are the ones who most get in the way and try to shield employees who don't do their jobs properly.

People with power (guns) abuse that power and we arrest them, give them a trial, send them to jail.

People with power (cops) abuse that power and some people set up gofundme accounts to cheer them on and claim that they just shot people because they were scared (notice they never want to look at details when it isn't cops shooting people - they just look at the numbers....) 




 And no one else ever did either. Heck, Christians are still just some small group somewhere and never went on any conquests. Think I will book me some tickets to the new world and see those 'Indians' there. Oh wait...someone killed most of them off. Probably them evil mooslims! 




 I always thought chief Wiggum was up to no good. 




 Conservatives will believe anything, and deadbart knows just which dog whistle to blow to get them all panting and running about. 














 Not fully. People break the laws all day long - every time someone speeds, doesn't use a turn signal, etc they are not obeying the law.

Police have the ability to detain/arrest people and deliver them to where justice can be served - it is all part of a process. Cops are rarely at the scene of a crime when it happens (robberies, rapes, murders, etc). They are there to be called if someone sees something going wrong or survives something.

 




 What is the role of a cop in society? They cannot protect you all of the time. They can arrest violators if they are caught in the commission of a crime. How many people are shot in the US, or stabbed, etc a year in the US?

If you believe that the cops sole job is to protect you then I don't know what to tell you.

[Justices Rule Police Do Not Have a Constitutional Duty to Protect Someone](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html)  




 Why do you think they do? If you're a super smart conservative your answer might be "Cause they gets free obummer phones which never existed on earth till obummer! Git r done!"

Maybe they vote mainly with a party that doesn't despise them and is filled with racists. 




 Oh, I dunno, you must be right. Cops exist just so we won't kill each other. That is why there is one cop to one person - so they can stand around and watch to make sure we don't shoot each other.

ROFL. Riiight. I mean, if we didn't have police departments everyone would kill each other all day long (sounds rather biblical - original sin, etc). 

We have, what, about 400 cops per 100,000 people. And their job is to stop all those people from killing each other. Okey dokey.  




 Those guns got from the store to the street somehow.

So someone had to pass the background checks. 




 Wow, that's just dumb.

Especially the part " Police exist to keep pople from killing each other"

Heck, maybe the problem is all the gun owners shooting people there, eh? :)
 














 I can understand that. I don't think I ever watched Full House (may have seen a show or two with one of my kids, the people look familiar in it). I have never seen American Idol either and lots of people seemed to think it was the bee's knees.

It's not that I don't like TV I am just picky in what I watch (Twin Peaks, Broadchurch, Doctor Who, The Wire, Mork and Mindy, and as you mentioned Air Wolf). 

Now I feel old. * Shakes fist at computer* Get off my grass, and my screen! 




 A 'friend' of mine watched it. Said it was fun but didn't understand how she had pierced her ears. 




 I can see that the full retard division has shown up.

You know, the basic "If you help people it will encourage people to become homeless to get free stuff" brigade.

Right. Because people want to be homeless for a year or more and suffering just to get a cheap place to live * facepalm* 

Reminds of how conservatives have been preaching that if we extend unemployment benefits people won't look for work, and then turn around and claim there aren't any jobs because of evil ole Obama. Again, thinking that people enjoy taking huge cuts in pay and having an uncertain future.

These are the same folks who yammer on about us needing to pay more money for more wars so that we can have peace. We inaded Iraq? Let's do it again! And hey, while over there let's hit up Iran too.

Maybe those countries don't want us to invade them, maybe they don't want our 'help', and maybe a lot of us don't want to spend money on more wars and killing but actually helping people here - because it isn't terrorism or Iraq that is causing the pain/suffering/death here. 

Dear conservatives, stop being so damn stupid when it comes it basic crap so many other countries get right. Like health care/single payer. You want to save American lives, focus on what is actually killing them (hint: it isn't terrorism or 'laziness'). 




 It will be like with the cops. "I thought he had a gun/wmd/etc, so I am excused for shooting him a hundred times even though there wasn't a weapon."

Basically, the bush doctrine. 




 LOL - only a conservative with an agenda would buy that.

Tell us, what are the actual numbers? Ohhh 70% - scary (if you can't think for yourself and watch fox).

 




 Define "Qualified". 




 Yeah, but it was because... "reasons". 

Only in the US do we find people not outraged by this, or at the best, questioning of it.

The pat, conservative, response is "They didn't stop, so they had it coming!" Yeah. Maybe we need to rethink how we do some police work here - but saying that, to some, means you are a flaming liberal who hates cops and wants a lawless society. 




 And that is, imho, a part of the problem: "Sides".

LEO's see themselves, in general, as part of a group. If you don't support them, you are against them. I was 'punished' at times when I was one because I wasn't always on the 'cop' side. But then I was young and idealistic. I saw it as a job. Others saw it as a life style choice and the teams were us and people who weren't us. 




 Ever watch a police chase? How many end with that may shots on unarmed citizens?

Ohhhh. I see. You think cops should just unload their weapons on unarmed people. Just let their 'animal' instincts take over. After all of those shots you still think a guy should jump on the hood of the car and keep shooting. What are they, storm troopers who can't shoot straight?

Reminds me of conservatives. They want to investigate Benghazi for years but when cops kill people here just shrug and say "They had it coming". Riiight. And if you don't see how the two connect, think about this:

4 Americans died in a hot zone and the right wants someone's head for it - someone here in the US they can blame. So much so they have had multiple investigations and don't blame the people who did it, they never talk about them, but want someone in government held accountable.

Yet, right here in the US, cops can kill unarmed people - not just in this case - and the right just shrugs and blames the people killed and backs the government. 









 So obey or die. Great way to run a society, pretty much the conservative/fundie mind set. Isis approved message.

Wonder how so many other countries get by without shooting and killing their citizens? Must be a mad house in the UK, Iceland, Europe, Canada..... 




 If this were Cleveland they would just shoot them 137 times and call it a day. 




 Depends. I spoke up several times on issues, which gets IA(internal affairs) involved. It made my life hell there. 

Imagine a police force like being a very very partisan website when it comes to politics. Sometimes, people don't listen to reason and see anyone who doesn't agree as a threat - ala the old "you are with us or against us".

There has to be a will, not just by a few officers, but by the public and those in power, to take it serious. I was harassed by senior deputies (sgt/lt). It didn't help that I personally knew the sheriff and he had hired me in. Keep in mind, the sheriff is elected and comes and goes, and he/she has to play politics with those who have been there awhile. 

Police forces are, for a big part, political entities. They won't reform themselves from within. 









 We have plenty of troops - all of those militias who run about protecting the border. They are just itching to shoot up something. I am sure they will be on their way there, without even being asked, any moment now.

"Hey Billy Bob, grab you gun and wake up cooter! I done loaded up our bibles, flags, and guns. We have to save America, again. This time, it's for reals. Git r done!" 




 Mecca? Isn't that where Pee Wee lives? http://imgur.com/G7BWuca 




 I don't care how it is sliced and diced, way too many shots were fired at two unarmed people in a car. The cops probably fired more bullets at that car than the entire UK police force has fired this century.

They obviously weren't even looking, just shooting - all based on a 'belief' that the people were armed. When we stop holding cops accountable we are giving them a green light to continue on this path and we will see more of it. 

It is a sad day when you are more afraid of cops who carry guns than citizens that do. 



















 Weird. I thought he was all about rights and the constitution, etc. Equal protection under the law and all that good stuff.

Do we have mandatory interracial marriage? My x was 1/4 Indian, so maybe he is on to something. I seem to recall the Lutheran church we attended at the time being forced to marry us. It was awful.

Why do the craziest people in the US mostly belong to the republican party? 




 And lots of Americans believe in an invisible sky daddy who wants to destroy the entire US because of those gay people.

Americans are a little funny about some things (they ignore all the other sins, of course. Cause there is really only one sin the right things about all day - and it involves sex). 




 Yeah, I know some people don't believe in excessive force and such. And others are fine with cops just shooting people who don't pull over (See it all the time, right? So it must be the standard procedure you endorse). 




 *Biden says that during the transition, he was warned not to expect any cooperation on many votes. I spoke to seven different Republican Senators, who said,*
 *"Joe, Im not going to be able to help you on anything," he recalls. His informants said (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell had demanded unified resistance. The way it was characterized to me was: `For the next two years, we cant let you succeed in anything. Thats our ticket to coming back, Biden says.*  




 They want to see Obama fail (ala republicans/rush/etc) because if his policies succeeded it would mean that the conservative ones were wrong. So they worked against the US doing better. 

They care about one thing - winning elections. And when they win they want to work to dismantle things from science to epa. Their whole philosophy is stuck in the stone ages and based on 'just pray - god will save us. Oh, and give us money for more weapons, cause we really don't believe god will save us'.

They used 9/11 to make wars, patriot act, tsa, and to consolidate more power - power which, suddenly, they think is wrong since Obama is president. Now, again - rather suddenly, they want lots of investigations into an attack. Something they didn't want much of when it came to 9/11 ("Don't criticize the president, we were attacked, real patriots would stand by him and wave flags!"). 




 "Defend the country." Riiiight. What were we defending it from?

Was it Iraq's massive air force/navy attacking us? Ooops. Probably not. This is why conservatives side with cops - if you are scared, shoot someone and claim it was "Defense".

China and Russia are bigger threats to us than the ME, yet we didn't launch wars against them. Remember that 'cold' war? It stayed cold because more intelligent people were in charge. 




 So, 2 unarmed people, 130 shots fired, 2 people dead, and the cops were just doing their job.

OK. As a former leo myself I am left asking "Wonder why people have problems with cops?" and the answer seems more and more clear all the time. 

I guess the lesson is - shoot all you want, just tell folks you were reasonably scared, and you have nothing to worry about. Unless, of course, you are a lowly citizen and not a government employee. 









 I am going to miss Ireland. According to conservatives here in the US god will be mad now. Jeebus will send storms, earthquakes, etc to punish the entire country. It will probably sink beneath the waves. 

I wish we all could be smart scientists like conservative fundies and understand nature better. Word of advice, when god starts destroying Ireland, run. Don't look back, or you will turn into salt as punishment. If we hadn't kick god out of the schools more people would understand this. 




 I don't even really blame people who voted to authorize use of force. It was bush who used it, who kept us there, who controlled and ran the war. He was, as he might say, 'the decider'. It rests on no one's shoulders but his own. 









 As an independent who voted reagan and bush I find that funny.

A large part of the republican party is incompetent. From Iraq to religion to everything in between, conservatives don't tend to think for themselves anymore and are more interested in screwing over the US and playing politics than they are in actual working to better the country.

They are regressive socially, prefer corporations over their own country, want to remove just about every regulation and regress us back to the times when rivers would catch fire from pollution. 












































 They have already determined that there weren't stand down orders, etc and so on. Republicans care more about benghazi than they ever did 9/11 - but then, they don't really care about the US, just punishing those who aren't like them; from gays to democrats the right is still crying over their losses to Obama and work against the US for their party.

Patriotism is just a word they use to control the weak minded folks who vote for them. Wave your flag, clutch your bible, and cheer on sending troops to be injured and killed. It's what those 'patriots' do. 




 We'll get right on that soon as bush and cheney are behind bars. Don't hold your breath. 



















 I am shocked they didn't shoot him 40 times, or at least beat him a lot.

Police forces are becoming (more of) an embarrassment in this country. 




 Um, doesn't appear to be "Live" 




 And she was right. 
























 I think you summed up my own feelings quite nicely. 







































 Wrong. One is about people who were born a certain way, one is about people who chose to be a certain way. 




 It doesn't have to say anything - it is obvious from his sign.

And how does he know they are 'Mexican'? Because they don't look like him? Oh...right. The only country where people 'look' like that is Mexico.

Yeah, that screams conservative. 




 Let me guess. He is a conservative. 




 Naw, don't even recall the name - just thought it funny that someone would say that when losing an argument. It was the only thing they said that resembled being truthful/intelligent. 




 If not indicted, then conservatives/fox/rush/etc would all be out yelling, "See! I told you they did nothing wrong, this proves it!"

Now it will be "You can indict a ham sandwich, so this means nothing!" 




 Hmm, wonder if it is that guy who swore he would follow me around reddit and downvote every single thing I posted because he lost an argument with me? That would be funny :) 



















 Yeah, not quite like Fox articles where it's all lies and a headline, which some people seem to have a need for :) 

Concise, simple, and was a breaking news item (but you aren't allowed to say that in the title here). I will note, for those who may need this information, a website called "google" will assist you in learning more about something if honestly interested.

Some sarcasm in all of that, perhaps. 




























































































































 Funny - I wasn't talking about Obama. Typical of cons; can't read and comprehend. Try it again and let me know if you need any help. 




 Ah...libs. Those damn people who care about freedom for folks to marry, against silly wars, want to be able to work together to provide health care/etc for fellow humans like other countries.

Nothing like conservatives. 




 This isn't new. It was reported on 9/13/2012 by CNN (and presumably others).

I guess it is new to people who only cared to hear what they wanted back then and because con news sources were all whining about the video and obama not using the word 'terror' seconds after the attack.

Once more, the right got played by their own news outlets who distracted them.

Even Hillary noted it was a small group (which they were):

http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/

Elsewhere we see that there were folks saying it could have been a planned attack but no one was sure "at that point" (kind of like how folks aren't always sure a cop shooting someone was justified at that point until they investigate).

The admin also said they didn't think it was Al Qaeda, which it wasn't. And "He stressed Zawahiri's threat was only three lines in a forty something minute video tape. Given the language in the tape, analysts would tend not to have concluded an immediate attack was likely."

http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/14/in-attack-aftermath-disagreement-over-how-it-began/ 




 LOL this is NEW??? Jeebus. On Sept 13th CNN reported on this.

 Meh, Karma doesn't really translate to much. I don't like the way cops get away with crap here in the US, used to be one and hated it back then (the 80's). The right seems to worship government employees with guns - when I wish they were as critical of them as they pretend to be of some other people in power they say abuse their power. 




 I can have one because I used to be one - isn't that how it works? 




 Not an attorney, but I spent the night in a holiday express last night. 

I would say, send them a link to this story on a check (in the memo) for 0.01 cents. See what happens. 




 Han shot first.

 And conservatives aren't liking seeing their fellow humans being allowed to be married, free, not in wars, etc. It also irks them that they can't have their own brand of isis/theocracy in power here....

See, this is easy. 
























 Weird. I heard the only people in the US who hated cops were blacks/liberals. Looks like them responsible gun owner whites are the ones shouting to kill cops (reminds me of waco....) 




 Not just the cops - conservatives. If this were a group of black people doing this all we would hear about is "welfare, absent dads, crime rate amongst blacks" and so on and so on.

Then, someone would bring up "Black on Black crime" and whine like little babies about how "Black people don't get upset when citizens kill each other but do when government employees do" as though it means something (in other words, they will ask things like 'why aren't blacks protesting other blacks killing each other?' as though that is even close to an intelligent question).

Now imagine the bikers were muslims....jeeebus, it would be all over fox, every single forum on the net, with people screaming.

White folks do crime? Meh. They don't represent Christians, gun owners, or straight people. They are seen as individuals with problems.

Conservatives aren't exactly smart folks though. 




 I find his comment on names interesting as well. Has he heard the name 'Barack'? 





























 Leslie Neilsen did it better:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP7F7Uw6yP4 




 Maybe it works like this: God takes all the water, using his magic, from one place then drops it on another. He likes spreading the punishment around.

Conservative fundies call the above 'Science' and it is what they want taught in school.  









 Betting they get Agent Cooper on the case. Any witnesses see a one armed man? 




 Ah, typical republican. "We agree to open a public business but we shouldn't have to honor the 'public' contract part of it. 'Cause we are special, jeesbus tells us so! And if we serve gays it will make god all angry and he will kill people in the US with storms and quakes!"

Yeah, not dealing with people playing with a full deck. I expect him to say something like that. Now the good little conservatives will rush to give him a gold star or little American flag next to his name. "He respects jeebus and isn't a muslim born in kenya who ordered stand down orders in Benghazi - all of which we proved about Obama."

Good lord, why do these type of people even get votes and who would actually vote for them? 




 He wants it to be like that. All the cons want to do is sell fear - for more patriot act, tsa, more spending on weapons. All the while ignoring the things which actually impact people here in a negative way an harm them. From poverty to health care to just about everything else. 

The American Taliban just wants to push jeebus, 'christian values', and the idea that the only problems, ever, in the US are because people are just lazy. All the while believing that companies can do no wrong, never do, and if we just remove all epa regulations companies would hire people and never, ever, harm our water supplies, air, and so on.

Not smart people - he would be a good leader for such folks. 
























 Because republicans want to save more money to give to Israel (apparently, both Israel and God don't have their own bootstraps).

The RW believes that people need an incentive to work and that all humans on earth who get aid are just lazy, but will run out and get the jobs they claim Obama lost if you make em suffer more.

Conservative fundies aren't known for their intellect and respond  to emotion and religion (the poor should pray more and rely on Churches and god, like the right does for the defense of the US....oh wait...they spend money like drunken sailors on ways to kill people. They actually have zero faith in god.) 




 Now imagine much of the populace listens to fox news and believes it. 14 years after 9/11 the only thing they talk about is the benghazi episode on 9/11 where most people died, bush was a hero, etc and so on.

Between hannity, rush, levin, fox news, and the emperor I can easily see why people might discount facts and history - because some people are just dumb. Han probably listened to a rw con radio show all day while flying in the Falcon ;)

(It's a joke people) 




 She voted, wrongly imho, to give bush the authority to go to war.

He abused that authority. Now people want her to be responsible for what he did? Where were those people back then and up until 2008? 




 Yeah....no.

The US is so far behind other countries on this it isn't even funny.

I have 5 kids, with a few different ladies, over my near 50 years. Each one is different. Pregnancy and child birth are different for each person. 

Conservative types tend to try to make things simple and compact based on the few. Hence why they are so regressive on things. 

Which is funny - because when it comes to religion (for example) they go on 'belief' and get upset when challenged. When it comes to protestors about government (police) abuses they call everyone looters. When it comes to women having kids they think of them as simple factories and want those women back out and 'producing' again in no time.

And yeah - I agree, add matching time for mother and father. Try having a wife really sick (who, btw, died some years later because of her health issues) and being punished by the company you are working for because you took one day over the allotted 3 to care for her.

Conservatives like to make everything about their real god - money.
