 I have the same problem with DA:O - I create a new save and I'm all like "this time I'll totally be with Leliana or Morrigan!" And then instead Alistair falls in love with me because I can't not find him cute.  




 That's really clever (and also super adorable). 




 That I will agree with. Most of the time rape "jokes" are just sexism or other such nastiness disguised as humor. And even though you should be able to joke about anything, that doesn't mean that if you don't handle certain subjects with sensitivity no one will call you out for being an asshole. 




 Wow, that's really ambitious for a first knitting project! Most people I know (myself included) did something really simple like a basic scarf or washcloth. A whole blanket is pretty difficult. But it looks really good! 




 I would say that you can make jokes about rape or sexual assault which can be funny, as long as they're not encouraging sexist ideas or blaming victims or any of that nonsense. For instance, Wanda Sykes did a pretty funny routine about having a [detachable pussy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CCsQtwIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJv5pjSRSLGQ ei=pK5NU46fJMOhyATMp4LgDg usg=AFQjCNEL8ux845yL89JRK5UGUmXXFRdkwQ sig2=f8viZ9fhz-TyifeqIeXKkA bvm=bv.64764171,d.aWw). She's joking about rape, but not in a nasty way; rather she's using humor to deal with an unfortunate situation. 




 Yeah, now that I think about it pretending to be jealous about Sansa because that's how a girlfriend would react or even being actually jealous because she's worried that she could lose her sugar daddy is definitely a possibility. But turning down the diamonds seems like the exact opposite of that.

Also, with Shae refusing Tyrion's gifts that sets her apart from other whores, as if she is the real deal, his girlfriend who just happened to be a whore - unlike, for instance, the story about the whore who became their grandfather's(?) mistress and started getting uppity about it until they stripped her naked and marched her around Lannisport. But if she betrayed Tyrion for money rather than jealousy Shae is also more in line with this theme. 




 You might want to consider going to /r/polyamory or /r/nonmonogamy and asking them for advice, if you want to pursue an open relationship.

Also, I would say that you should probably take some time to really sit down with your boyfriend and have some honest discussion about what it is the both of you want. If he's lacking confidence, perhaps there is some way you could reassure or encourage him to try rougher sex. Otherwise, you can talk more about the possibility of an open relationship. Whatever you decide, good luck and I hope things improve for you both. 




 I'm so sorry this has happened to you, and I just wanted to say you're not alone and your family is being shitty.

For a good portion of my childhood I was physically abused by my brother, and my stepfather chose to ignore this. Even now, my stepdad's family constantly tries to guilt trip me over how I need to be a better sister and they don't understand why I finally got fed up and cut my stepdad out of my life. But I just couldn't tolerate having every conversation with him turn into "you're a horrible sister and you need to treat your brother better" despite the fact that my brother left me with PTSD. Nothing about this situation is okay. And nothing about your situation is okay.

No matter what your family says, you shouldn't have to forgive your father or even be nice to your father if you don't want to. What's most important is your safety. I'll never forget the first time I heard someone say those words to me - "if you don't feel safe around your brother, you shouldn't have to be around him." It wasn't until I was 18 and in family therapy that I was finally told this, and I remember finally feeling validated. It's so awful when practically everyone around you is telling you you're wrong for not wanting to be nice to or hang around the person who hurt you. If you don't feel safe around your dad, you shouldn't have to be around him. If you aren't ready to forgive your dad, you shouldn't have to. It's not about hurting your parents on purpose. If their feelings are hurt, it's not your fault - it's theirs for causing this to happen in the first place and then refusing to amend the problem. So don't give in to their pressure, because you have done nothing wrong. 




 Especially if it's for an animal, because they won't even get the benefit of placebo effect. 




 Like the doctor in Germany that tried to tell cancer patients they should give up chemo and take vitamins? 




 Also, checking an animal's teeth is one of the easiest ways to see if it's generally healthy - if its teeth look nasty or there are a lot missing you know it hasn't been taken care of really well, and the previous owner is giving you a bad gift. 




 I kinda wish they hadn't gone that route, though. You still got some of it in the books, but it seems like the show is placing a lot more emphasis on "Shae betrays Tyrion out of jealousy." In the books, though, I like to think it was all about money from the get-go. Like the scene with Littlefinger talking about how a good whore will make a man think that she is enjoying herself despite her expectations, I feel like book-Shae was just making Tyrion think that she fell in love with him despite herself but wanted his money and status the whole time.

Also, I think that this motivation is more in line with Tyrion's motivation; its basically the inverse of his first marriage. It makes his rage a lot more justifiable if he wasn't merely betrayed, but felt like he was lied to from the beginning. Finding out that Shae betrayed him out of jealousy would put at least some of the blame on him for not properly maintaining their relationship - it was a problem he could have potentially amended. But if she never loved him to begin with, it is yet another example of how the universe has fucked him over and he never had a chance because he's a dwarf. And that seems to be the recurring theme with all of his issues - I can't get anyone to love me because all they see is a dwarf. 




 Actually, this is why I usually prefer fan translations to official ones - often times the fans will deliberately put in translation notes that will explain puns and references and whatnot that the official english won't always do. Of course there are still a lot of official translations that are really good, but there is always some cultural context lost whenever you are translating so usually you get a more nuanced view of the work if you read/watch/etc. in the original language and you are very familiar with the language. 




 Chaos Life is such a good comic. 




 The whole virginity contest thing made me equally go "gross, those guys are awful" and "shit, this actually happens in real life and that hits a little too close to home." 




 No, I haven't seen it yet. I don't have HBO, but a friend of mine does, so as soon as I can get together with them I'll be watching it. 




 Yeah, I was actually really shocked at how well he does some of the characters. I'm willing to bet he probably does some sort of research or talks to people about this sort of thing. 




 Yes, and no. I was more like Arya when I was younger, maybe - I would stubbornly refuse to be put into a box. But Arya also doesn't face the same pressures that Brienne does because she's still a young girl. It's not uncommon for younger girls to be given more leeway in defining gender norms because they're still children. Once they grow up, though, if they continue to defy those same gender norms they're treated more like Brienne is. After all, half the time Arya is mistaken for a boy so no one questions her behavior. Brienne doesn't have that luxury; pretty much everyone is aware that she is female and they vilify her constantly for not behaving in a way that is more aligned with the female role in her society. By now Brienne is supposed to be married and bearing children so that she can assure her family's political ties and continue her husband's family's legacy. No one is going to blame Arya for not getting married and having children - she hasn't even hit puberty yet. 




 There is no reason why two bi people can't have a great relationship. If you're having problems, that shouldn't be the reason. Is your family hung up on some misconception about bi people being more promiscuous or something? Because that's just wrong.

However, if hearing about your boyfriend's past relationships bothers you, I'd say this might be the real reason you're having issues. Have you thought about why it is that him being with guys before your relationship bothers you? Is it because you feel jealous, or think that it somehow threatens your current relationship?

You should probably bring this up with your boyfriend and work something out. Tell him about your misgivings, and you'll be a lot more likely to work through this and find happiness than if you just sit and stew over your family's opinions about two bi people apparently being incompatible because reasons. 




 I really relate to Brienne. I'm a woman who's not exactly feminine, so I've gotten crap from lots of people my whole life for trying to be "like a boy" or not doing things that are "appropriate for a young girl/lady." Well screw that. I don't wanna be a "young lady," I wanna be me. And being me involves a lot of things that it just so happens aren't stereotypically feminine. So yeah, I can really relate to her struggles with not feeling like she's pretty enough or not having a place in a world that pressures women into being a certain way. And I can relate to a lot of the harassment she gets. I think she's a pretty well written character. 




 I love comics. In fact, I sometimes talk about comics so much that even my nerdy SO gets tired of my Batman tangents. If I ran into you reading a comic book in the library, I'd actually be more willing to strike up a conversation with you about it than I would most other books. 




 #44 bothers me, it might be nitpicky but they wrote Peach's name wrong.  When written vertically, the second character should be a straight line going up and down, like this:

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oW8UqTh.png) 




 I really like kissing and cuddling. I also don't mind groping or making out. But I don't really enjoy full on sex that much, either. 




 I would certainly be interested. 




 Wow. That could have gone really, really bad. Glad that you had some nicer (and less ignorant) classmates! 




 That's ... kinda gross. 




 I would say that, at least from your description, it seems like you might be bisexual but heteroromantic. In other words, you are attracted to men and women but you only have romantic feelings or desire to have a relationship with men. 




 THE NEW SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES IS COMING and the premier is on my roommate's birthday so we have an excuse to throw a wicked party. Or just get drunk and eat cake in our underpants, whichever. 




 Nope. Not at all. It's just clothing. In fact, if there was a freezing girl nearby and he had an extra hoodie/wasn't cold I would consider it rude to not give it to them. 




 Oh, yeah, the Iron Bank will definitely cause some issues in the future. Littlefinger borrowing from them and Cersei refusing to pay the debt has put the kingdom in a really bad position with the bank. They've already sent one representative to hound people and collect their due, but I doubt they'll stop there.

Even if they still play nice, though, at some point when the war is over whoever becomes king is going to have a huge issue paying them back. I doubt Littlefinger is willing to help anymore - he's moved on to other things besides being the Master of Coin. With winter here there's not going to be a whole lot of trade, either. More likely, they'll go bankrupt just trying to feed people considering the war kept them from reaping the full benefits of autumn harvest and a lot of the fields and crops were seized or destroyed by soldiers from various factions. 




 And my point was that he would make a much worse ruler than Daenerys because at least she isn't totally psychotic and is willing to actually reason with people instead of demanding things because "I AM THE BLOOD OF THE DRAGON RAWR" 




 Dany: I am the rightful queen and the mother of dragons!

Random peasant: Well, I didn't vote for you! 




  Viserys might have made a better ruler if he ever got to be king

I'll have to disagree with you there. Viserys on the throne would not have been much better than Aerys or Joffrey. Don't forget that Viserys was abusive, manipulative, and completely self-absorbed and entitled. At the very least, Dany is attempting to learn from others on how to be a good ruler. Viserys just demands that everyone does what he says because he's a king, despite the fact that he's really a king in exile and his lineage doesn't mean shit to people like the Dothraki who live outside of Westeros. 




 I agree. If anything, I'd say that Stannis never won love from anyone. He was, however, able to gain the respect of his followers, which is arguably more important in some cases. Still, Melisandre is not particularly good at winning people over to his cause. 




 I really appreciated Sansa a lot more after reading her POV chapters. In the show she's pretty passive and is mostly just a victim to the cruelty of the Lannisters; in the book, you see that she starts to gain a will of her own and not only finds a way to inject small acts of defiance, but also learns how to play the game of thrones and become more pragmatic rather than depending only on fairy tales. 




 That's certainly an interesting thought. I'm fairly certain we'll see more of Braavos in the future, especially since that's where Arya is. But how strong is Littlefinger's connection to the place of his ancestors? I suppose we'll find out. 




  He was also sent off after he got Lysa pregnant.

Actually, he was sent off after he challenged Brandon Stark to a duel; Lysa didn't tell her father about the pregnancy until after Littlefinger had left.

Also, the problem with "create chaos to assume power" is that chaos is rather unpredictable. In the midst of a war like the War of Five Kings, literally anyone can gain or lose power at any time. We see it happen constantly - leaders rise and then die, soldiers change sides, marriages are made and broken. Your fortunes can change before you know it, for better or worse. One of the things that Littlefinger is best at is protecting his own interests, and creating a volatile situation that could just as easily get him killed as it could get him a lordship seems a little risky, even for him.

I won't disagree with you about his hatred of higher nobles, though. There is some deep resentment there. 




 Wow. That theory actually makes a lot more sense - especially since it would explain pretty clearly why Petyr says he took the virginity of both the Tully girls, not just Lysa. 




 I'm pretty sure that the Targaryens are the exception, not the rule. For one thing, there aren't that many instances specifically mentioned, but whenever it is mentioned it's usually a group of siblings all marrying. This was so they could keep their Valyrian blood pure. There was no need for anyone else to do this.

Also, you have to keep in mind that in a feudal society like Westeros, everything is based on carrying on the male line; having multiple partners confuses succession, even if they aren't simultaneous relationships (see the Freys). Considering the fact that they literally started civil war over succession, you can see why people might want to keep things less complicated.

Additionally, it seems as if everyone else is going with the two people in a marriage limit; even in Dorne, where some of the nobility have relationships openly with paramours, they still only have one spouse. Margaery Tyrell was married multiple times and there was a lot of emphasis placed on how her marriage with Renly was never consummated and therefore invalid; if bigamy was allowed, this would be less of a concern. And Tyrion also seems to think that his marriage to Sansa is invalidated by his previous marriage and the fact that they never consummated after their wedding. 




 So I finished reading ADWD earlier this week, meaning I am finally able to read all the posts on the main five books! Huzzah!

I have to say though, the biggest question still burning in my mind after all this time is ... what the hell is Littlefinger's motivation?

It seems to me that his most obvious trait is his ambition. He was humiliated in his youth because of his lower social position, and it seems he'll stop at nothing to gain more power (while screwing over people who were born with it in the process). So his maneuvering to claim a lordship, become ruler of Harrenhall, marrying Lysa, etc. is obviously a part of that goal to gain more power.

What I don't get, though, is why he convinced Lysa to poison Jon Arryn. There are only a few possible reasons I could think of to do this; it's possible he knew that Arryn suspected Cersei's children weren't Roberts, and did it on her orders/to curry favor with her. Considering that he also helped Cersei when he betrayed Ned, it could be that this was all part of a ploy to get on her good side.

But then we're still left with the fact that he basically instigated the War of Five Kings. I just don't get why he would have told Catelyn that Tyrion was responsible for the assassination attempt on Brandon's life. It seems like he's going through an awful lot of trouble for mere personal gain.

Any ideas or theories about what Littlefinger's really planning? 




 Starfighter was originally a webcomic which I just started reading, so I can't give a great synopsis, but it involves some awesome art and sci-fi goodness. If you haven't read the comic yet, you should check it out [here](http://starfightercomic.com/chapter_01_page.php?page=Chapter_01_Page_01.jpg). If you're interested in the Kickstarter campaign, I would highly encourage you check that out too! I'm personally a big fan of visual novels (essentially a choose-your-own-adventure comic in video game format), but unfortunately not many make it to the English-speaking market. Supporting projects like these means we'll get more in the future though, so I'm certainly considering a pledge. 









 Looks really interesting! I love the art style. 




 Yes, I do find other people beautiful. I don't masturbate, and I'm neutral toward sex. But there are lots of other aces who like to do both. 




 Yeah, that's also true. 




 Technically, though, she isn't - since Tyrion was already married to someone else. 




 That is very helpful, actually. I had no idea there were THAT many books. But this certainly gives me more info on where to start so I can finally break into the series. My best friend's family loves these books, so they'll be happy to hear about my finally getting around to reading them. 




 Yes. But that's exactly why I don't like reading it - it reminds me of when I was young and foolish, lol. 




 I figured it was probably something like that. I know when I read through sex scenes it usually doesn't phase me, but a lot of times when I see them in movies or on TV I feel really awkward. So I can relate. 




 I play a Rover, occupation is a Tinker, and I was at the inaugural game in Indiana for the Iron Fields. I also have an NPC character that is a Tinker, which will hopefully be used again in future mods. 




 Were you at the first game this past weekend? It was pretty awesome! 




 No, it's totally normal. I don't personally do it, but there are plenty of aces who do. It's just not my thing. 




 Hm. That would probably be a better reason to skip the show then. If you don't like watching violence you shouldn't watch the show. Also, I'll go ahead and warn you that some parts of the book have pretty violent parts too, so if you don't like reading them be prepared to skip over certain sections. 




 If you don't like gratuitous nudity, I wouldn't force you to watch the show. You should definitely give the books a try, though! 




 Ugghhhhh Daario is such a tool, I don't know why Dany ever liked him. 




 Never heard of those, will check them out though. 




 But there are also other ways to have more inclusive language. Someone else mentioned that instead of saying "ladies and gay men" you could simply say "people who wanna see hot guys," which totally solves the problem. 




 Well the scene with Jaime and Cersei that Brandon walks in on is obviously important, also I'd argue that the scene with Drogo and Dany on their wedding night was necessary (but they completely fucked it up in the show). Also emberspark mentioned Jon and Ygrette's scene, which wasn't the one I initially thought of, but actually the scene with Melisandre making weird shadow-babies was kind of plot important. 




 Well, that and you don't shit where you eat. He owns the brothel, it would be bad business practice to screw his own employees. 




 Yeah, I like that about it too. 




 I've heard a lot of good things about Discworld and have read some other stuff by Terry Pratchet (Good Omens), but never got around to that series as there were just so many books in it that it was a little daunting. 









 Yeah, this actually looks like it would be a lot of fun for the kids, and there are lots of psychological and physical benefits to having a harness like this. Any way you can improve the quality of life for a kid that can't get around easily on their own should definitely be invested in. 




 Also, so does Tyrion's. 




 There are at least two sex scenes I can immediately think of that are absolutely necessary to the plot, and another one that while it wouldn't be necessary to give screen/word time to would still be important to mention or imply that it happened, so don't worry, there isn't just a bunch of needless gratuitous sex for no good reason besides sex. 




 Doesn't she have dreams about him? Can we get sexy dream Drogo? 




 Porque no los dos? 




 I can drink to that!

http://photostock.newsmonkey.be/gif/07/03/75.gif 




 If you like fantasy at all, you should probably give it a shot. The books are pretty fantastic too - it's the best major series in the genre I've read about treating women like actual characters and not symbols or objects, which is nice. 




 I don't really know either, I was mostly joking. The comment was made in good humor, thus the little tongue smiley thing. 




 But that's exactly the reason why pan was coined - bi implies that there are only two categories to be attracted to, and it excludes people outside the gender binary. Although there are also some bi people who say they only like two, such as women and agender but not men, for example. But pan covers everything.

Edit: Also to address your initial point, of course people who otherwise identify as nonmonosexual should be included too, I usually go by queer myself. I was mostly teasing the person who made the original comment. 




 I imagine you would notice though if you had some strange new fabric rubbing up all over them that you don't normally wear. 




 Okay, that one was pretty good :D 




 Tormund Giantsbane would totally disagree with you. Also the number of sex scenes in the book is pretty high. Oh, and Tyrion talks about dicks and sex a lot. There is a lot of that sort of thing in ASoIaF. 




 Well, considering that those types of retreat things are organized for the express purpose of bringing brothers closer together, I'm pretty sure that the campfire would be a good time to come out if you're ready. It will most likely come up in conversation at some point - there's usually some opportunity to share more private things about yourself. Just take the chance when you see it.

Don't worry about saying specific words or trying not to cry. It's okay to be emotional - coming out is a huge thing! It's okay if you cry a little, I'm sure some of the other guys will cry a little too.

The best advice I can give you is to just be yourself. Everything else will work itself out, or you can deal with it later. 




 For real, that shit is not cool. They go so far to avoid showing dicks on that show during sex, meanwhile naked ladies everywhere (cough Littlefinger cough) 




 There is an awful lot of talk about breasts, but then Dany also talks a lot about having sex with Drogo, so I think that's more because it's specifically from her point of view so of course she'd notice her own boobs. 




 http://www.vmusic.com.au/Vmusic.Web/media/images/tyrion_dancing.gif 




 Well, as someone who is female-bodied, if my partner wanted to be breastfed by me, I would decline. I am not into that.

Not to say that other people can't do it, just not something I would be comfortable with. 




 There is so much penis with Tyrion alone I'm pretty sure he should be the god of dicks and wine. 




 Or Hodor. 




 He deserved to be poked fun at just a little bit, though. He does talk about dicks a lot, and he has been promising dragons for forever ... 




 Not really. There are a ton of dicks in ASoIaF. 




 What about all the people who are bi/pan? :p 




 If your "friends" won't support you in this, fuck 'em. The only way to make things change is to take action, stand up for yourself, and nail this asshole to the wall. You should definitely press charges, and I hope that the law is on your side. 




 Manly Guys Doing Manly Things is one of my favorite webcomics ever. It's full of so much awesome. 




 Wow, I can't believe you're doing such an awesome project and kickstarter! I love Rooster Tails, all of your comics are really honest and insightful and funny and all sorts of other wonderful adjectives. I will definitely be contributing.

Also, if you do go on an American tour, you should consider a stop in Louisville! It's a wonderfully queer-friendly city; the first place in the entire state of Kentucky to pass legislation protecting trans rights. I know that there would be plenty of wonderful nerdy people who would love to see you and read your new books. : 




 You aren't just cute. You are super adorable : 




 Or panromantic. Unless they're already familiar with GSRM issues (and even then) most people have no idea what pansexual or panromantic mean. 




 Really though, that bias is in all self-report data; people always want to make themselves look better, and will often change their answers to whatever they think the investigator wants to hear. 




 I really love the DA TTRPG, it's pretty easy to learn the mechanics and if you play DA at all you're already familiar with the setting.

I don't know if I'll have time to play, as I'm gearing up for the hell that is the end-of-semester-in-college experience. But if I get more time later and you still need people I might join. 




  My original belief is that he would have taken her by now if that's what they wanted and it seems stupid a nice guy like him would waste his time trying to get someone. And in this time he's actively tried and found another girlfriend and hasn't waited for her to leave me.

I'd say that's probably an accurate assessment. If he was really that interested, he most likely would have made a move.

And yeah, the problem probably has a lot to do with your anxiety. I know how that sort of thing can really make you stress out over something that turns out to not be a big deal. However, it seems really real and important in the moment, so it's good that you took the time to examine this. Introspection, even when overblown, can still be a good thing. Sometimes you just have to stop and assess your life every once in a while to make sure things are all on track.

Anyway, though, just letting it go is probably the best course of action here. If problems arise in the future you can deal with them then, but there's nothing horribly wrong going on right now so try to relax. : 




 To borrow your metaphor, yes, "board members" get to all have a say on what will affect the corporation. However, each board member is still an individual person - they only come together to make decisions when those particular decisions affect the corporation. But whenever they are spending time out of the office, they are free to do whatever they wish with their own personal life. And if one of those board members hangs out with people that another board member doesn't happen to like, that doesn't really matter because what they do in their personal time is separate from the corporation.

Sure, marriage does make you to some extent part of a "joint life," but it doesn't mean that now and forever you have to do every little single thing together. The two people who are married are still two people; no matter how much their vows say otherwise, it would be impractical if each of them had to ask the other for permission before stepping out of the house or going to the bathroom. And whenever you're in an open relationship, that means that you and your spouse have the "corporation" but everyone you meet outside of that corporation is a part of "personal time," unless you both choose to bring them into the corporation as well. In other words, OP's relationship with the other guy is separate from her time with her SO, since they aren't both dating him; therefore, she and she alone determines how to proceed with their relationship. Husband might not approve, but since it doesn't directly affect their marriage he can't just outright tell her no. He can merely inform her of his opinion - ultimately the decision is hers. 




 When you marry someone, you might acknowledge their opinion as important to you. But that does not mean they have a right to control various aspects of your life, especially if it doesn't directly affect them. Women aren't their husbands' property. It is not a husband's job to tell his wife who she can and cannot be friends with or talk to or whatever. 




 I dunno, I kinda like the sound of dr_fishy, lol. But yeah, I might change my mind later, just for now I want a break so I can figure out what to do with my life outside of academia. 




 Unfortunately :/ 




 Thanks. As much as I wish I could quit, I also know that finishing my degrees will be better for me in the long run. Although I'm pretty positive now that I won't be going to grad school, I'm way too burned out. But you're right, it won't be bad forever, and I only have to hang in there for one more year so it's not too bad. 




 They can hurt if you don't put them in far enough, but assuming you're doing it correctly (it's not that hard, so I don't doubt you are) you shouldn't even feel them while they're in there. So no, it is definitely not normal for tampons to hurt. 




 Yeah, I remember that one too. It was pretty good, even if it was super depressing ... 




 While it is possible that your bro's girlfriend has a problem with some of the flirting, I wouldn't say that the three of you are weird or wrong at all to have the close friendship that you do. As long as the three of you are all comfortable with one another, and there are no hard feelings between you, you should be able to do whatever you want with your friends, even if it includes flirting or talking about sex. That sort of thing is pretty harmless.

However, if you really want to assuage your fears you should probably talk to the other guy's girlfriend about it. Next time you see her, just pull her aside and say, "hey, I know you know how we are and that we joke around a lot, but we never explicitly talked about it, so I just wanted to make sure that none of that stuff really bothers you. If it does, we'll stop."

Don't worry too much about being assholes this whole time without even knowing it. Most likely, even though the other girl doesn't join in it probably doesn't bother her that much, otherwise she most likely would have said something by now. And if it does actually bother her, it's on her for not being clear about it - not your fault for not knowing her true feelings, especially if she went this long without saying something. 




 This seems like it would be a really efficient method for TPing someone's house. 




 Of course I do. I feel like an important part of healthy self-image is being able to laugh at yourself. So yeah, I make jokes about my asexuality with the friends I'm out to quite often. I think my fallback is usually whenever we're on some sort of topic about sexiness/attractiveness and I'm just like "I literally don't give a fuck." 




 Agreed - it seems to me less like K is too immature to be with OP and more like husband is to immature to be with OP. 




 I understand that you love your husband and don't want to jeopardize your marriage. However, your husband does not get to pick who you have feelings for. He can't control your heart, any more than you can. It sounds like he has all this misconceptions about K, and honestly he comes off as really judgmental and hypocritical. How can he say whether or not K is mature enough to handle a relationship with you? Who made him the love police?

If I were you, I would just tell my husband firmly but politely that he doesn't have any say in this. You're poly, you can date whoever you want, and as long as nothing really dangerous is going on (abuse, drugs, crime, etc.) there is no reason for him to intervene. He might not like K as much as you, but that doesn't mean he gets to dictate what happens in either of your lives. 




 Usually, yeah, they do. And yeah, at least half of them were somewhere along those lines.
