 I mean, it's no Hellcat, but I'm looking forward to getting one.  




 Let's not forget the upcoming Focus RS. 




 TIL: Your dad and brother are dummies.  




 lol, too easy?  Drunbs Dread?  The pro's cried so much about how hard it was, they haven't been back.  After playing there for years and years, they made some renovations to make it harder, and the pros didn't want to play there anymore.  




 Anyone that drives a BMW.  What the fuck is wrong with you knob gobblers?! 




 I always told my employees to give the customer one warning about abusive language, after that to terminate the call.  Any manager or boss that allows a customer to verbally abuse their employees is (from what I've been told)breaking the law also.  Employees do not have to put up with a hostile work environment.  




 Well, let's just say I won't hold my breath waiting for the PGA Tour to come back to Cog Hill.  




 No, I  get that.  The US open is at different locations all the time, and they go back to some of them (pebble beach), but I'm willing to bet that if this course plays as hard as it could, they'll never be back.  




 That's a good deal.  They giving you swag too? How about a round of golf?  I got a windbreaker and a free round.  So it worked out.  




 I volunteered at the BMW Championship, the last year it was at Cog Hill, and it cost me $150.  I thought it was worth it...  did you have to pay?  




 The pro's all cried about cog hill, and now they'll never be back there.  I'm guessing next year's open will be at some favored course again.  




 You're the one with reading and comprehension issues.  The masters is in charge of the masters!  




 You really don't understand how the PGA tour works, do you?  




 What part of private tournament are you having problems understanding?  




 Sounds like a neckbeard was trying to hit on you.  




 Even if the PGA didn't consider it a recognized tournament, it doesn't change the fact that it's a private event, held by a private club.  The money is what brings the players, not the PGA. 




 It's a private tournament on a private golf course.  Don't like it? Then organize a protest and try to stop it.  There is no sanctioning body to "correct" them.  




 It's a private tournament, with a big cash prize.  No one can stop it.  




 Stupid people shouldn't piss me off as much as they do, I mean, it's not their fault.  But stupid people really piss me off.  I'm glad to hear this story.  




 Wow.  Consider my mind changed.  I feel like I need to go and reread the books for a fourth time now... 




 The Ace?  You mean Mace?  And noooo, the man is a dunce.  Everything in the shows and books point this out.  




 At golfsmith, they usually do fittings for free, and they have clearance clubs for sale too.  




 Take lessons first.  The lessons might change your swing.  Then get fit for clubs.  It makes a difference, even for us high handicappers.  




 I just finished a set of lessons at golftec, and it's helped a ton.  Last year I was shooting in the high 90's, this year it's low 90's and I've shot an 88, 3 times.  I would find an instructor that used video.  




 My flop shot.  I see it like a gun.  I'd rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.  And if you're not careful with it, it can really hurt you or someone else.  I practice this shot 25% of the time on the range and use in maybe once every 3 rounds of play.  




 Check out the myprotogo app.  Frame by frame break down, and you can draw on screen.  It's free and it allows you to send the video in for tips (cost money). 




 No, the man is a dunce.  




 The show seems to have gone in so many different directions than the books, that I can't even being to guess what might happen next.  It's really cool!  




 I'd love to see or read that!  




 Damn, that's right.  And how many walked away?  2? 




 Lots of the head green keepers will have some dog or another.  




 This times a thousand.  In the books, they make this out to be one of the most epic battles of the whole war, and it happens at the end!  All the surviving bad asses from each side, squaring off. Was it 4 on 5 or 5 on 5? 




 I heard a saying once, "try to make something idiot proof, and God will just make a better idiot". 




 Read and play cards.  




 I know that, but I've also seen plenty of things that shouldn't work, but do. And things that should work, but don't.  I've worked in retail, management, food/service industry, product design/engineering, and in automotive repair and restoration.  I've seen some shit. 




 I practice my flop shot a ton.  But I see it like having a gun.  You hope you don't have to use it, but when you need it, it's a good thing to have.  




 I did and I've found it to be true.   




 Have more confidence and ask out more chicks.  




 Worst. Feature. Ever.  




 You can't put a square peg in a round hole, but you can put a round peg in a square hole.  




 There are no shortcuts.  




 She's a keeper.   Your girlfriend seems nice enough too... 




 This needs to be a top comment.  




 Take a drive out to the burbs.  Better courses, better value, and some of the Rangers care.  




 Reading this just made me so angry.  I hate "parents" like that.  I've found the best solution is to say something the very first time the child does something inappropriate.  And I don't say it to the kid, I turn to the parent and firmly say "do you mind controlling your child?  This action/ behavior is not allowed here for safety/insurance/privacy/corporate policy."  If they say shit or let it continue I call a manager over.  When I was a manager, this is what I trained people to say, and if I got called over, I informed them that if said behavior was not corrected, that they could take their business someplace else.  




 Correct sequence is where the lag comes from.  From the top, the swing should start with the feet, then legs, then hips, then shoulder, then arms, then last being the hands and club.  This is "lag", and is probably the hardest thing in golf to get right. 

Since the golf swing starts with the hands and arms in the backswing, it's hard for us amateurs to not start the downswing with the hands and arms too.  




 This is the most correct answer.  The giant club face helps, but also hurts, same as the long shaft.  Mistakes get compounded and amplified.   It's also part mental.  

You should try taking what feels like half a swing and a slower speed.  Just try to deliver the club face back square to the target. 




 My set up - 50 deg gap wedge, 54 sand, 58 lob.  Plus what ever deg the standard pitching wedge is, which comes before the gap.  




 The bounce matters more than the deg.  My 58 doesn't have any bounce, so I can open it up and use it for flop shots from the fairway.   I use my 54 that has bounce, and I just open the club face for short shots or leave it closed for longer ones.  




 Super bowl results.    




 Sex and golf.  




 Sweet story and all, and glad you had a little bright on your day...  And before I sound like a jerk, let me just say that I've worked all sorts of retail and food service, and I'm always polite, but COME ON.  You chit chatted 20 min away, while the line built up?   Nothing drives me more crazy than this.  Look, I'll smile and nod, but I got places I want to be, that aren't in line, waiting to give you my money.  Can you please make sure to just move the line along. 

Once again, sorry for being an ass, but I just want to pay for my shit and go, not listen to the two of you chat the day away.  




 It hasn't been an issue for me, but I'm not racing it on a track or doing many U turns...
