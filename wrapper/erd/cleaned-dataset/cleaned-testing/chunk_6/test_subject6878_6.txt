 Well ghost, I will surely look into it. I looked up a few earlier that were anywhere from $60 to $180 per appointment. At this point, if it'll help me help her, money won't be a problem. How do I go about looking for one of these in my area? Google, psychotherapy in city, state? 




 All of the advice is definitely helping. She has been working since 8:00 this morning though so I haven't been able to contact her. She was going to get off late Sunday and our plans were just to have me stay over at her place. We made these plans last night after she changed like this. It was only last Sunday when she was over, smiling, and we were perfectly fine. And she doesn't lie well, so I would know if she was hiding something. Is changing that fast common? And is there a possibility she'll have a mood swing back to happiness? 




 Thank you Star. I probably won't see her for awhile because of the distance and her work schedule assuming she cancels the recent plans we made. Will it be detrimental if I spend too long away? It's not my choice. I just can't drop in unannounced because she's almost always at work. 




 Okay. I texted her asking if the plans we made Sunday are still on. Should I not be giving her the option to say no? I don't want to push her too hard. 




 That lifts my spirit actually, the last thing you said, assuming you're right about it. She has the kind of depression that she feels like a burden on others though, especially me, and doesn't want me around. Do I push her to allow me to spend time with her like you said? Or is that a bad idea? 




 I hate to say this, but I probably can't afford it. I've thought of doing this though. I want to be able to understand so I can help if she ever does turn to me again. Are therapists relatively inexpensive? I will do just about anything right now to be of any help to her. 




 I'll take your advice, no matter how hard it will be for me, to leave her be as long as she needs. We actually don't live together, she lives about 35 minutes from me, so I can't really be close to her right now. I myself feel helpless since I'm so far away, and the only mode to speak with her is via text, since she can't be on the phone at work and she doesn't have a computer. 




 Is it common that people can't? I know it's only been a few days but it's still very scary for me. She thinks she just needs to be alone but won't listen when I tell her it's her depression saying that, and I want to be there for her. 




 **TL:DR: My girlfriend was diagnosed by a therapist with depression, and she is trying to push me away. I read that that was one of the symptoms and I need to stop her from doing that. What should I do?**

My girlfriend just started seeing a therapist (she has been to one session, her therapist was sick so she had to cancel the second) and she was already diagnosed with depression on the first visit. It's extremely frustrating for me right now because she is trying to push me away and isolate herself because she thinks she is just going to bring me down. I'm afraid she will push me away until she thinks I won't want her back no matter what I say.

I don't know what to do... Should I just be patient with her and hope the therapy sessions work? We were very serious about our relationship , and not three days ago everything was perfect. She all of a sudden snapped one day and completely locked up. She lives a bit away from me so I don't get to see her as often as either of us would like, but it's mostly because of her work schedule. She works way too much, so much that she pretty much works dawn to dusk six days a week and she doesn't have to, and it hurts her sleeping schedule.

She is at the point where she already won't listen to me because she thinks things are hopeless and just wants to give up. She isn't normally like this. She is usually the happiest person in the world, bringing immense joy to anyone around her. I'm worried about her well-being. I need to know if I should just be patient and let her do what she needs to do, or if I should prevent herself from pushing away the people in her life who care about her. I'm at a loss. Please, someone help me. 




 My subconscious is an evil genius. I wish that were true. And you're probably right. Oh well! 




 I know.. I'm stupid... But there were only 4 other players on the map and I figured most were in Elektro or Cherno so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. I haven't quite figured out where the more trafficked areas are yet. 




 When I first fired it, I thought, this should be called the dinner bell, not the enfield. But for some reason when I was on the ground and shot a zombie none of the others came running. I think it was a glitch at first :\ 




 I managed to reach the Chernarus International Airfield about an hour ago, armed with a crossbow and two bolts. After killing a couple of zombies and two of them unfortunately falling on top of the bolts, I was left without those precious arrows I love so much. With a useless weapon, I decided to discard it in the bushes and grab my ax.

I spent a good amount of time searching the ENTIRE airfield. Not a building was left unchecked. The first weapon I found was an AKS Kobra, which was great, but I *really* wanted a silenced weapon. So I left it be, and continued to the other end of the airfield. After finding about 6 AKs and AKMs, a shotgun or two, and about 3 G17s, I decided to make my way back to the AKS with a Kobra. After reaching the spot where I had originally found it, I discovered I had somehow managed to completely overlook an M14 AIM lying in the same building. Tears rolled down my face. I still feel new to the game, and this was the greatest thing I could have found.

I leave the building (I assume was the barracks) and head to the tall hangar building. I climb the ladder to the very top most point and decide to try out my rifle. I snipe quite a few zombies, amazed at the accuracy of the weapon, only to hear grunts like I was hurt. I thought, there is no way a zombie could have gotten me. I was surrounded for sure, but I know I was at a safe distance from them up the ladder I had climbed. The glitchy polygons were getting annoying, so I disconnected and reconnected from the server. Don't know what I thought that would help, but at least the zombies were gone.

I head down to the roof below and look over the edge to see a survivors body. Those were the grunts I heard. I felt so bad. He had an AK on him and perhaps he was saving his own life by not shooting me in the middle of a zombie-infested airfield, but it seemed more like he was hoping I would befriend him and fight alongside him. My jubilation at finding a rifle and practicing with it brought the hordes around him, before he could climb the ladder, and he was murdered right under my nose without me knowing. I could have helped him. I had plenty of cooked steaks, bandages, painkillers, and some morphine I found in the Elektro hospital. I did not want his sacrifice to go to waste, so I grabbed the GPS off his body, left the rest in case he came back, and headed into the forest to take a break.

**TL;DR: I got you killed at the NW airfield for firing my new rifle and I'm very sorry. I took your GPS. I get lost easily... Sorry again.**  




 What happened here? I'd like to know the answer if anyone can still give it 




 I laughed when I don't feel like being happy. haha, thanks korn! 




 So much vacuuming... That's all I've been doing for awhile. I'll probably nuke it with some bug bomb like you said. It's just such a hassle. I hate these things. 




 Thanks for the advice, I'll probably try that. Will it work the same if they're bed bugs? Or do I need to do something different? 




 Girlfriend found a stray cat on the side of the highway and we took it in, killed the fleas on it but not before it was too late. I'm not getting bitten but she wakes up with bites every time. Any way to kill the fleas in the mattress? If the only way is through professional help, I'll do it.  




 I picked up camo, put it on, then decided I shouldn't have grabbed it from this guys tent, so I put it back. I still looked like I was wearing it. Is that one of the bugs? 




 I was just playing in a server for about an hour in Elektro, and decided I wanted to go find a new server. When I load back up, I load in Cap Golova with the starting inventory. What happened? 




 This is a great reply! I appreciate the information. I'm looking forward to the new additions to the game 




 Thanks man! I'm new to the game, so it's nice to know this kind of thing! 




 Care to explain? 




 It's wild how DayZ does that to people, but I completely understand. I was very frustrated when I posted this. I'll still play, because the gathering of resources and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing, we just had an unfortunate situation where my buddy had something to do IRL, so we had to hurry through main towns to the rendezvous. It won't happen again. 




 I started 4 days ago. My fear of zombies is so great I was too crippled to play the first three days. Those first moments consisted of me finding a hatchet, but being too afraid to approach a zombie. Being too afraid to enter the woods. Being too afraid to enter towns. Basically, the coast was my sanctuary. By the fourth day, I found myself on the far West side of the island, near Zelenogorsk, with one fellow survivor.

After 30 minutes of running towards the north western edge of Zelenogorsk to find a lake that we were told would be there, I happen across a truck. This truck belonged to no one. It was spawned, missing two tires, no engine, and an empty fuel tank and damaged hull. We spend the next two hours moving back and forth between Zelenogorsk, the lumber yard, and the location of our truck, finding the necessary materials to repair the vehicle. When we finally finish, I'm armed with an Enfield, he a shotgun, and our truck houses our high quantities of sodas, cans of food, and essentials, like bandages. It also held our M4A3 and a CZ 550. This truck was sanctuary. We made the decision to rendezvous with two other friendlies at the far Northeastern edge of the map, where they had no vehicle and wanted to be transported.

After 2.5 long hours, we hop in our truck and begin the arduous, treacherous journey. After successfully navigating all the way to the final town on the map just before our destination, we're ambushed, the driver dies instantly, and I smash my face into the dash when the truck crashes, killing me.

It literally destroys any chance of me enjoying this game knowing that, no matter what you do, everyone on DayZ is evil. After playing for so long, being at 12,000 blood, to die in a split second, it will never seem worth it. I thoroughly enjoy this game, but why can't anyone work for their own things? There are plenty of vehicles on the map. We spent hours fixing up our old truck. Whoever that was in Krasnostav today, on server US 1832, I will never stop playing until you are dead. 




 It might depend on the material. Calc 3 for me was literally the 3D version of Calc 2, minus the series stuff. Two was by far the hardest, but it was nothing compared to Linear Algebra.. 




 I snipe a lot, and it's sometimes easier with the ACOG because there isn't a very large scope sway like with the powered optics. 




 I meant hoards of zombies, sorry about that. And stepppes, there's no need to be an asshole here, I'm stating what I would like in a game, my opinion. That's why it's an opinion. Don't talk to me about looking stupid when you can't even type sentences properly.
