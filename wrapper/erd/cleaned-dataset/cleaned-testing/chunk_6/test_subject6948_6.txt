 Hell has frozen over.  




 Captain Falcon, Pit, Wii Fit Trainer, Marth- 54952 




 Had to choose 3 amiibo on release date...

Got Villager and Link (they didn't have Marth), so I needed to choose between Wii Fit Trainer and Mario. 

Chose Mario.  




 I've found no Pit, Marth or WFT amiibos in my entire state. A few Falcons are about an hour away, though, and everyone seemingly has Luigi. Thank you for this! 
 




 Diddy's pretty rare.

I've only seen one in store. Like, ever. 
 




 Ursula, Cruella and Maleficent are WAY more iconic than most of those characters. It also helps that they've set up Ursula for a while, and they've apparently planned out an explanation for Maleficent. The only one that's confusing people is Cruella. 




 I TRY TO NOT SUCK AT SMASH, BUT THIS ASS WIPE SAT THERE AND FUCKING U-AIRED CONSTANTLY AS MARTH AS A COMBO, THEN TEABAGGED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I DISCONNECTED AND HE REPORTED ME.

SPEAKING OF MARTH, I WANT THAT AMIIBO DAMMIT!  




 They told me they couldn't hold anything due to it being holiday hours or something. All I can say is I'm happy I picked up Villager on release day, and regret grabbing Mario over WFT. 

I'm still on the hunt, but it looks like I'll have to rely on Ebay.  




 Wisconsin native here. When I called in to a local Target, they told me SPECIFICALLY they had WFT and Marth on shelves, and described them. But when I got there, they said they never had them and that it was out of stock for about 2 weeks. 

They didn't apologize for the inconvenience. 

I've searched all 3 Targets in my area (Appleton/Menasha), all 4 GameStops, 2 Best Buys, and a Wal-Mart. No success. 
 




 GOD DAMN IT

WHEN I ASK ABOUT MARTH AMIIBOS AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE THEM, AND DESCRIBE THEM PERFECTLY, DONT TELL ME IT WAS NEVER IN STOCK WHEN I GET THERE

ALSO, I HAVENT PLAYED ROB AT ALL AND YET YOU GIVE ME ALL OF HIS CUSTOM MOVES FIRST WHEN I PLAY AS FUCKING EVERYONE ELSE

I KNOW I SUCK AT SMASH, BUT CAN ROSALINA PLAYERS ACTUALLY PROVIDE A CHALLENGE ON FOR GLORY INSTEAD OF FUCKING ROLLING N' SHIT AND SPAMMING LUMA SHOT 

ALSO I HATE YOU EVENT MATCHES

AND CHEAP-ASS KILLS ON CRAZY ORDERS I SPENT MONEY ON YOU I COULD'VE USED TO BUY A FUCKING POWER PELLET TROPHY

WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A SHITTY POWER PELLET TROPHY 




 All stores in my area carry nothing but Mario and assorted. 

There is no way for me to find them in-store.  




 So, the last time I hosted a tournament, it was a huge mess, no communication between us and just major problems everywhere. While the tournament had nearly no lag (Way to go, Brawl!), it was just confusing and people couldn't hear. 

This time, I'm hosting one IRL with some friends from school. What do I do in order to keep it running smoothly?  




 When I sent in my Wii U for repairs, I asked them if it would be back in time for Smash Bros. for my little brother. Not only did they allow us to ship it for free, but they also arranged overnight shipping at no extra cost. 

Their customer service rocks.  




 Season Finale: Emma, Elsa and Anna fight against the now-evil Baby Neal, who has magic abilities like Emma now and summons Cthulhu or something as his servant creature. 

Plus the Three Little Pigs.  




 I honestly like the idea of an open world type of Sonic game. If they implemented characters right, and still featured some levels like the Classic and Modern styles in Sonic Generations, it would work. I'd love a game like this. 

I think the main problem is transferring the speed and excitement of the previous games over to this open world. What would work best is the Sonic Adventure formula, but with larger levels inbetween the "Gotta go Fast" zones, and a few 2.5D Classic-styled segments as well.
