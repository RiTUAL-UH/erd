 Jews 




 I agree it's tough to imagine. I see it as a trickle-up effect. Which actually has a better chance of working than trickle-down, because trickle-down has failed miserably. 




 The issue with that is, we already DO have enough resources for everyone. Ownership is what fucks it up for 90% of the world. 




 What do you call a man with no arms and no legs floating in a pool? Bob. 




 Good idea, actually. Do that for a year and report back. 




 I just watched a documentary on Stress. Baboons, after being observed for 30+ years, went from being a serious, violent hierarchical group to being a communal group with little violence after the highest males were killed off by disease. And this continued for generations and was resilient to change because every time an unfamiliar male baboon came into the group and tried to dominate things, the group basically neutralized him and he became part of the commune.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, let's remove (that is, strip them of position) all the most powerful people in our society and watch the world flourish. 




 Thanks for the comment. It was a casual match. 




 Love it
