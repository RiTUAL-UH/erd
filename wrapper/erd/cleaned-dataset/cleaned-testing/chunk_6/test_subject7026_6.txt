 Flathud blue version, he said it in his Jag video. Trust me I'm not fooling you. 




 "Oh great and powerful one, I request that you present me with 300 Disco Beat Down unusuals." 




 Assuming they turn into ham and the only thing that remains of the person was the shape, no. 




 There's a truck near my house that says "HALE" on it, there's also a street named 'Market GR'. Also there are places you can buy the Fourth Doctor's Scarf which is what the Chronoscarf looks like.  
Ironically this is in New Zealand and not Australia. 




 Walking into something to kill you is allowed, you could add in a rule where being dominated means you can choose your own weapon or something.

 Selling TF2 items over PayPal for a profit is illegal because you're making profit using what Valve created. ^^/s 




 He's on his second account. His first didn't get VAC'd, I don't remember what did happen though. 




 "Valve throw me like $30 I'll go VAC ban him."  
"thanks /u/cringeworthy_ here u go /u/scraptip +banana" 




 I wear a Chronoscarf always so I kinda wear one on the toilet. 




 Thank you so much!  




 Geel's paying me mad cash to shout out his new feature!  
  
^^^^I ^^^^wish 




 oh no you found my alternate account please dont give me scrap for the videogame known as Team Fortress 2! 




 Of course I changed my email minutes before getting it and can't trade for 5 days :[] 




 I'd send you phishing link and gift wrap it to me, duh. 




 Stocket Launcher is great though, and changing servers can be done if you need to 




 Wow, I've never gotten a Scraptip before, Thank you 3 




 fuck outta here 




 You could give your one to the other person then autobuy another. 




 Imagine a whole server agreeing to this though, after a while everyone would be using the same items, I want a whole server to do this and I'll run around SOASing everything. 




 He posted this 50 times. I got 50 notifications saying "This asshole has left a comment on your profile" and had to delete them 1 by 1 for like 20 minutes. 




 Very simple premise, start with whatever you want, but the moment you get killed you must switch to that class and only use the weapon that killed you.  
Did you just get killed by the Eyelander? You Now are forced into the Eyelander until you die, at which point you switch to whatever killed you.  
  
You are allowed to use items that aren't in the same equip slot, for example the Tide Turner/Wee Booties or a Soldier backpack.  
  
Have fun letting Rockets kill you so you can use rockets.  
  
Also you should use the Auto Buy thing from scrap.tf before you do this, just to make sure you can use all the items you need. 




 There are literally 60 left. 




 Because a) Easy profit and b) Some people are so rich they don't care about .66, I wish I was that cool. 









 Then put it in my hands, I'll never headshot anything. 




 Get a Hale's Own Machina then put the part on later, the part counts starting from when you got it. 




 I was on a 24 hour Dustbowl server and I ubered out the gate. My Soldier jumped away and left me ubered at spawn doing nothing, a Spy is blocking me so I throw the uber to him and he wipes out the Heavy I was in a call with and 3 other players. The spy gave me a 5 ref for being a cool guy. 




 Omg dude you use the :] face too? This is amazing I thought I was alone! 




 It doesn't add to the conversation as a whole, but it does add to 'Sir or ma'am'. I personally downvoted that comment but can understand why it would be upvoted. 




 [I'm sure you can do something with this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps) 




 This makes me not want to ever pop, that idle fully charged sound is too good! 




 It was probably an autoban that you can appeal on their website, assuming they have one. 




 People don't like seeing 'Upvoted!' comments, they don't add to the conversation much. 




 [/r/wehavetoomanytf2subwaysandwichespleasestopmakingtf2subs] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) 




 Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like? 




 Wait so if I put like an Australium RL on the market and it doesn't sell for a long time I can get the message of finding it ingame? 




 Make like a tree and *fuck off.* 




 Farming kills isn't that bad, considering that you did have 6,000 kills, it's morally not that bad. 




 Sorry about your items and all, but why do account hijackers take such stupid items sometimes? I've been hacked before and they took like 4 ref worth of uniques and a strange weapon while all my cosmetics were safe. This dude took most of the cool stuff and... A unique Degreaser? And two backgrounds?  
  
Anyway the Amby is pretty good if you're a good aimer, I'm more a fan of using the Enforcer because Kritzkrieg is disgusting on that. 144 crits? Forget about it, more than I ever needed. 




 There was a 50/50 chance of this being dumb and enjoyable. 




 Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty2Hotty would Super Sayin Fuse together and win everything. 




 Wait the Usos are his kids? Yo I had no idea. I think I just stopped caring about Rikishi by 30% 




 Is this why I found pictures of Pennywise when I searched for Scotty2Hotty Worm Gifs? Because there's a new IT film? 




 Stinkface will always be better than Mr Socko, anyone can bring out their dirty jizz rag, it takes a real man to sit on another man's face.  




 That's [Scotty2Hotty] (http://i.imgur.com/6C8xW.gif) 




 [W O R M] (http://i.imgur.com/AL5mliA.png) 




 I don't get it either, restriction weapons sound like Halloween exclusive weapons. 









 Spy. I hate Spy but he looks so good, very classy. 




 Heavy looks like my cat. 




 WOOOO! 




 Thank you. 









 Tony Stark? 




 I clicked because I wanted to know what it is. 




 George W. Bush wanting something that is basically a conspiracy itself? *Seems legitimate* 




 Personally I've never been a fan of the black paint, Tinge is so much better. The black paint looks like there is nothing there. Tinge however I like because it looks so crisp and clean. 




 This HUD is pretty, give me it now. 




 spy :] 




 Sorry about the 'Thanks!' spam, I'm just a really nice guy in real life and I say thanks to everything, so it kinda melted into tf2. If there were a 'Sorry' bind you'd hear me say that more than anything. 




 To be fair, 2Fort Snipers are pretty bad anyway. I wanted to play the game on the bridge not the respawn screen. 




 What an odd request that is, if KonKitty doesn't sell you them I can get you some. 




 I'd assume that like 4 of the downvotes are disagreements, the rest are people jumping on the bandwagon of downvoting op because everyone else is. It happens all the time, it's pretty much the reason contest mode exists. 




 *hey guys there is a 0 at the end of mine there is also a 6* 




 I'd rather see bitching than people trying to make puns that match my name, that usually has discussion linked to it. 




 I use Zataoichi anyway so I hardly ever need a Medic, it's also great to hear "DUDE WHAT THE HELL!?" whenever possible. 




 I charge off a cliff if someone Quick-Fixes me and I'm Demo. It's fun. 




 "If the Buff Banner got nerfed..." Doesn't look like a pun set up at first glance, it appears to be a discussion of sorts, I expected something about MvM to be a hot topic for that thread, but no, it's a pun.  
"Scout seems to enjoy break dancing. You could say..." does seem like a pun after reading it, but I originally saw it as a possible discussion on many things, from an SFM of Scout breakdancing to a mod to make every class dance.  
Knowing how many puns are on this sub, I saw "Why don't snipers use jarate all that often?" and assumed it was a pun.  
"The Medic knew taping together his broken mug wasn't the best idea... " is the only one I knew for a fact was a pun instantly.  
These aren't always optional to click or not click with the knowledge of them being puns. 




 It's better to have them there than have them here. The puns are killing this sub they can go beat a dead horse all day. 




 Oh boy do I have some  
Kicked for Racism (I called the admin a moron and apparently that's a racial slur.)  
Kicked for using bitch weapons (Direct Hit)  
Kicked for Pubstomping (I like using Kritz, sue me)  
Kicked for hacking (Dindu nuffin)  
Kicked for hacking ("Become satisfactory, obtain hehehecube")  
Kicked for hacking ("Dude this sniper... Hackey McGee over there.) 




 Short Circuit is the only one of those that is a *hard* counter.  Spycicle is easy to deal with, just keep wm1ing for two seconds and you'll probably find it, Pyro isn't even the only counter, Soldier's splash can reveal a cloaked Spy.  
DDS just means you need to wait for a second to shoot them, Sniper isn't the hard counter to Sniper, it's Spy.  
Amby. 




 Who cares what he said, there's too many puns to hear what was said. Please return to /r/tf2dadjokes  




 I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror! 




 I can tell you what I'm saying, I'm saying Happy Cakeday. 




 If we can have everything by this guy added, that would be great.  









 On the bright side, I can get easy karma from nsfw subs. You don't get downvoted there, it's great. 




 It makes Projectiles useless. Demoman gets fully shutdown by a good Pyro. Soldier with Gunboats is screwed, Engineer can be stopped if he's Rescue Wrangler. It's a part of the game that with skill counters any skilled or unskilled players, spend 20 hours practising Airblast and you just stopped Soldiers and Demos from touching you. 




 As a Red Medic, suck it nerd lol red 4 life 




 [](#flair "request")
 




 The problem with that is, you'd need to give damage falloff to the stock, which it does kind of need, but it would change Demo drastically if he wasn't a direct pills only kind of guy. If there was an added Grenade Launcher with +projectile speed and -something I would use the hell out of it, I like hitting shots more than killing, it just feels better. 




 To quote my Key Pad 5 bind; "Fuck people who airblast"  
Also RS has like no skill required, it's somehow easier than wm1. 




 Unless it's a Gunslinger/Kritz, I put my Team Shine/Flames on a vintage Kritz because I don't have 28 keys to throw around. 




 Kill me now. 




 I'm so sorry for you, somebody showed me a pro ks unique bersaw and I cried. 




 I agree with you, but it may be a problem. 




 Whether it be 'Sappers now recharge like in MvM' or 'RD_Asteroid removed' or even 'Sniper and Spy removed due to complaints about being annoying', what patch notes would be perfect for you and what would make you switch to CS:GO? 




 Red Tape Recorder, You've got a disorder. 




 Some of these Medics... HELLO, NURSE! 




 You just really suck. 




 Rated comment. 




 The Shotgun works for killing Pyros, Charge Targe Demos and Scouts who jump way too much.  




 Someone please link me to the video people are talking about. 




 [Or he's like me and doesn't care] (http://i.imgur.com/jUWw8DP.png) 




 [Balanced. I should use this thing more than once.] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3741638880) 




 Also the best weapon for spawn campers. 




 When it comes to money people will do many things. Using people's computers to get easy money is just that, easy money. I can understand why they would do it but wow that is cheap. 




 The title says all it needs. Man that's dirty. 




 Can I get some info on it? 




 I got no clue 














 I've had this image for like [weeks] (http://i.imgur.com/ZEmJ1gi.png) 




 Play spy it's easy and fun, why else are there 6 of them? Because it's powerful! 




 [Yeah dude] (http://i.imgur.com/gwRFcKi.jpg) 




 Blutsausage? 




 All Blutsa- Blautserg- Bluesausage- The Combat Medic one. All Combat Medics. 




 If it's too long for me to read it's nerd shit. This is the way I live my life.  




 I googled German speech I dunno what this nerd shit is 









 "Pringle is a bad Soldier."
