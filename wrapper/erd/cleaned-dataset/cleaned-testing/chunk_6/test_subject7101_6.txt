 it a utter shit show that i'm surprised is still on the air 




 so you went into the designated smoking area and complain you smelled of smoke when you went home? 




 a large majority of people both young and old don't like the greens it's been this way for a long time 




 people would switch the tv off if they did that lots of people don't like the greens 




 as i said if a kid is being unreasonably loud and they can't control it they should leave it's as simple as that.. that's the respectful thing to do they can easily feed the kid at home if they cannot control it in public

other people shouldn't have dining experiences ruined because some little brat won't keep quite

it's not that people hate kids it's that people are sick of parents that allow kids to continue being loud or often run around the restaurant or whatever..


 




 if you are unable to quite the kid down you should leave as to not disturb everyone else around you that's the respectful thing to do

other people should not have to put up with a loud child no matter the age of it


 




 what the woman did might of been a little harsh but lets admit it we've all thought about doing it when a parent just lets the kid squeal and scream in a public place because they are too stupid or lazy to control them

when i was a kid if i did what this woman's kids did i would of been in trouble because my parents knew how to control us and respected the people around us.

really sick of the parents that just allow kids to run around screaming in public and make excuses like they are finding their voice or we where all kids once.. those excuses just mean they are bad parents that can't control their kids

 




 i hate to say it but i'm getting sick of hearing about gay marriage now.. every fucking article/news report etc etc almost every day of the week 




 does the majority want change though?

still a lot of people who are against gay marriage 




  imo the last time we had a hung parliament and ALP needed to make deals with the greens etc is what made people hate the greens 




 The job cuts were always going to happen email has taken over for the vast majority of people I cant even remember the last letter I sent or received that wasn't a bill or something

Parcels are what everyone uses auspost for now 




 Maybe America should finish one war before starting another 




 it higher than most people earn some miners are on 150 or more 




 this kids attitude lately has been getting on my nerves he just can't take any criticism from anyone

he probably still thinks he wasn't at fault for the crash either 




 making pokie machines "plain packaging" would do nothing to stop people gambling just like making cigarettes plain packaging did nothing to stop people smoking 




 the new logo looks far better anyway, they were kind of asking for it with the old one regardless of how pathetic is it pursue them for it.. N5 is Chanel's trademark

 









 Ricciardo was in the right place at the right time when Mercedes had problems

besides that the other cars were piles of crap especially the Ferrari 




 just because he beat him once doesn't mean he is in the same league as him

plenty of drivers over the years have had off years 




 drivers don't get to choose who the teammate is 




 no one is getting fired they are taking a paycut on the already high wages they earn (some are on 150k or more)

besides the ceo taking a paycut to keep paying workers the same amount of money is not going to fix anything they would still be losing money as costs would be the same

just because a CEO has money in the bank doesn't mean they have to run the company at a loss that would just lead to workers getting fired in the long run when they lose more and more money 




 mining isn't as profitable as it was years ago even she has lost billions.. a small pay cut so workers can keep the job is not greedy they could of easily sacked them instead

it's the same of any other business no matter how big or small if they are not making money workers are the first to go or take pay cuts 




 Ricciardo is overrated imo due to last year

yes he beat vettel but his wins came from Mercedes having issues and safety cars 




 considering these people would be on good pay anyway (some would be on 100k+) a slight cut to a wage is better than losing the job 




 practically every country in the world that has freedom can do what you just listed 




 i expected to see stupid comments like this 




 i don't even have the game but just because you are not having issues doesn't mean other people are not

besides no PC game should have a fps cap even if you can edit a file to change it 




 i think they know a lot of people don't like the future crap and will make a ww2 COD to gain back people who probably won't buy black ops 3 or ghosts 2 









 i knew Ferrari would go after bottas the sooner they get rid of kimi the better

don't get me wrong kimi was a great driver he just doesn't have it anymore 




 there is always a way just look at china etc 




 if they are cutting career mode out of the game this year they are likely never going to put it back into the game unless there is outrage from the fans 




 they need to take a break from super hero movies over the last decade there has been WAY too many 




 it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.

sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.

the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.

then you have broadcasting which in many areas is no longer on free to air tv and attending races costs an arm and a leg and probably a liver as well 




 they can't many businesses and people use them all the time for legal reasons

they can't seem to grasp that VPN's are not just used by people wanting to pirate 




 fair use probably comes into play with other sites regarding copyright on most of the stuff they post

when you just take a pay porn video and upload it for free it breaches it 




 don't be so sure about that labor isn't in a good place and the greens won't ever be elected as a large majority of people still hate them 




 people already know they'll just have incentive to sign up for the VPN's 




 it will be easily for them to block sites like pornhub etc as many of it's users upload videos from subscription sites 




 i'm not a homeowner but you'll be hard pressed to find a home owner who would be happy to see the value of houses drop and they don't have to be rich to think like that 




 actually a large majority of people are.. labor is self destructing and people still avoid the greens like the plague so don't be surprised if they win the next election 




 living in that hellhole he'll be used to explosions 




 it's more the potential for him to go lone wolf like monis did 




 the fact he's threaten to kill people in the past and the courts went easy on him

he clearly supports ISIS

man monis did similar things and they screwed up by not keeping a eye on him letting 2 people die when he finally decided to kill 




 Queensland Liberal and panel member Steve Ciobo was unapologetic, saying he believed the only reason Mr Mallah was acquitted of terrorism was that the terrorist offences "weren't retrospective in application", and that he would be glad to see Mr Mallah sent out of the country.

so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring

he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society

if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis


 









 good hope they didn't die instantly for the pain they've caused people 




 foxtel can celebrate all it wants it's a few years away from falling apart 




 good luck getting people to vote for the greens

a lot of people hate liberal and labor but still won't vote for them 




 they are not going to give up areas that people live on it just won't happen

 




 this is why i believe the word racist is starting to really lose it's meaning and impact now

it's thrown around like candy even if someone is just criticising someone without bringing up anything about race
 




 this is the 2nd time he's lost control of the car since the upgrade in Canada

is he struggling with the new engine upgrades or just unlucky? 









 that's about all they will get no way in hell they'll get back any areas we live in

and honestly who would be willing to give up their home/suburb etc to the aboriginals

lots of people pretend to care but are more than willing to continue living here
