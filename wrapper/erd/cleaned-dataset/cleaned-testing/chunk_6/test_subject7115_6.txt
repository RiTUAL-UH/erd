 The eyes made me weak and quiver. Oh lord! 




 All day. Everyday. Mmmmf.. 




 My brother is his doppelgnger. He's had people approaching him asking his for photographs and autographs. He just goes with it (for the women) but he says it can be very tiring. 




 I would find so many things wrong with my place just to keep them around. 




 I never realized this... My brain... 




 He* 




 No. He got caught somewhere under my house and we couldn't get to him. We would let him play outside (as long as someone was always with him) and my dad was outside with him, left him out, went to find him and he went under the house. We had no way of getting him out. We died under my house. I was 11 and cried for three days. 




 What's a kd 




 I miss my ferret. I know Pedro is in a better place though. 




 I'm just saying. Doesn't really look like her. 




 You sure that's actually her? Because it doesn't look anything like her facially.  




 I don't believe in prayer. And I'm pro choice. Yeah, no rally or prayer meeting for me. I just don't like people messing with my state. If you want to leave the state, by all means leave, you won't be missed. I don't go around bad mouthing where you live so don't do it to where I live. But thanks for stereotyping me with the people who are no doubt the majority. I just wanted to let the original guy who insulted the state and moved away that he wouldn't be missed. That's all. I could care less about what's said or thought about me on here, just that I'm not the typical Texan. By all means bring your down votes. I give no shits about it. 




 Do I give a fuck? Lets check the board. Show me "Do I give a fuck?" [X] Ooo looks like I don't. 




 We don't miss you here. 3 




 I enjoyed this 




 Lucky guys.. 




 What if I told you that icon says 73 on everyone's phone 




 It's a stock pile of bacon for a burger restaurant. It was on Food Network.  




 Milo and Elijah Peters are twins that like to have sex with each other bareback. The top is one of them, so I'm pretty confident the bottom is his twin. 




 Adalia Rose? 




 It's a small juvenile sunfish. It may be small but definitely a sunfish. 




 But he said

I'm not annoying anymore lol
 




 The black obe.
obe 




 Compactors? 




 The song that plays when she locks eyes with the different people and the screen goes red? 




 His company has a new line of shoes. He doesn't, because he's dead. 
 [He died in 2010.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen) 




 Someone bought Hostess. News is that twinkies will be back on shelves sometime this summer. 




 That's really cool! I love all the little things in Tarentino movies. I just finished rewatching this and started Vol. 2 for the hundreth something time.

* **the shoe says "fuck u" on the bottom of it** 




 Good for her, good for her
Fantastic handwriting too 




 So I wasn't the only one who thought he looked familiar. 




 I'd rather support this thing than Adalia Rose.
He looks like ~~Chunk~~ Sloth from the Goonies. I fucking loved that movie. The way they chained ~~Chunk~~ Sloth up. Brilliant. 




 One of my favorites said "shaving the excess skin off your foot and using it as parmesan on pasta - justgirlythings" 




 I was wondering when the typical "post my alarm system panel because it says fap on it" post would appear. Have seen it in a couple weeks. 




 It kind of looks like America 




 Actually, I would say the same top three! I know Detox will definitely get in there. I like Ivy and I do agree, I hate the way they say her name. I liked Coco at first. Then she let Alyssa being there get to her so badly and now all she does is play the victim. Alyssa has gotten over it (except for having little digs at Coco every now and then, which is understandable to me being in the competition setting. People are going to try and put you down.) I would like Coco even better if she didn't have that attitude. Roxxxy is all body and face. No substance in my own opinion. But as far as top three, Detox, Alyssa and Alaska are the best predicted for it. I would want either Detox or Alaska to win though. But, if Alyssa gets that $100,000 maybe she could fix that overbite! 




 I think these top 7 all have something they're talented at. Obviously for Jinx and Alaksa it's comedy, Alyssa is a dancer, and they all display it well. Even though I'm disappointed with what she's done so far, Detox is really talented. She is a great performer in her own right, but I know she can do better than what she's given us on the show. 




 No one this season has any talent whatsoever? If that's your opninion then so be it. 




 You really haven't seen much of her work outside of the show, have you? She's brilliant and every bit as talented as Sharon. Yes she and Sharon do the same style of drag and they think a lot alike, but that is a bullshit answer as to why she got onto the show. I don't disagree that Sharon had some doing with it, but nevertheless Alaska is earning her keep. She needs to change it up like Michelle said this past week and that she's getting predictable. They said the same thing about Sharon. Sharon is all about spook, Alaska does more "glam". They're both unconventional. Alaska is doing a great job. 




 I only down voted this because you were lazy and used "ur" instead of just typing out the word itself. Sorry. 




 Most of the major universities in Texas have quidditch teams. Not weird or wtf. 




 This is a picture of the site where JFK was assassinated. They made a movie starting Kevin Cotner exploiting the conspiracy theory of there being a second gunman who delivered the fatal head shot. In the movie, Costner kept replaying the footage in court, narrating JFK's movements in response to the head shot, that he moved "back and to the left." 




 Don't worry OP. I know what you're referring too. I don't agree with the second gunman theory myself after studying it so much and physically going to the assassination site, but I know. 




 I'm gonna go ahead and say boat? 




 This is genius. 
*thank you for enriching my life with this image* 




 Seen it in Galveston, Corpus, South Padre and Port Aransas. I've seen it so much, it lost its wtf value. 




 Stu from Sean Cody. What a hottie! 




 This guy is a convicted child molestor if I'm correct. So maybe he hides children's underwear? 




 I think it was originally posted in r/wtf a few weeks ago. I commented on it saying "Paint me like one of your white girls" 




 My fancy is tickled. Thank you 




 I third it 




 You must really like downvotes 




 Bad form OP 




 I love eggs, but eggs with the orange faces of human babies are better 




 I am going to call that he pulls a reverse Micheal Jackson and turns into a black woman, instead of a white woman. 




 I bet it's bigger on the inside 




 :O
Justin's butt
I'm dead 




 "diva antics"

Love it 




 These seasonings are really good. You can put that shit on everything. 




 Above any girl up there, Willam is my absolute favorite, hands down.  




 Boy or girl, I would submit to anything Raven wanted me to do. 




 I saw it, noticed it, saw who was wearing it, moved on. I'm not a fan of Alyssa. 




 Him and David Tennant (10th doctor) 




 *their 




 Yes!...they know..it's a multi pass... 




 I would do anything to have sex with Jake Bass. He's one of my favorite porn stars. 




 Dealing with religious friends is tricky. If they love and care for you, the fact you're gay shouldn't be a big deal to them. You're still the same person, you just decided to share an aspect of your personality and life with them you hold value to. If they have issues with it because of their religious beliefs, they should have enough sense to look past it. If they don't, I wouldn't say they really cared for you. But don't take it offensively. They're missing out on amazing opportunity to know someone who is courageous, strong and just brilliant. I've had really religious friends who have beliefs against homosexuality look past it because of the relationship we have and for who I am. Hang in there. I never really believed it when people said it gets better, but now I can say that it gets unbelievably better. I became so much closer to my friends and my life is looking up. I was so low. I have nothing to look forward to but the top of the hill. I hope this helps. Good luck and love yourself. 




 Darn! Oh well. Thanks for letting me know though! 




 Source perhaps? 




 If this isn't a repost then I don't know what is 




 It's riddled with Doctor Who references. I've only had one person respond and know what it all means. Nice fellow. He just stopped messaging me one day. Don't know why. I always watch what I say. It happens a lot. Maybe I'm not saying the right thing? I would have no clue since I've only ever had one real relationship. 




 When I came out to my brother in November all he said was "About time you told me! I was wondering when you were going to do that." I told him because he was the only person with me when my ex broke up with me, via text. It was so great to tell him! Made me and my brother so close. 




 I try to make it as honest and fun to read as possible. After three years of going out to places to meet guys, and the same amount of time on dating sites, I've only had one boyfriend. It lasted for a good seven months. I've been single for nearly 5 months now so I need to get back into it. 




 I just joined that site a few days ago. I'm hoping all goes well. It's my third dating site. I don't do well in real life. 




 Not eligible for the Darwin Award. 




 Imagine having them both at the sme time.. 




 OP can you give the video? Thanks 




 I thinks it's sad there are people like that. 




 Didn't look like her to me
