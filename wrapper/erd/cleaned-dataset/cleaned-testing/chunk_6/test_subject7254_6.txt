 Good for you! I do math for a living.

Perhaps your anger comes from having political opinions that differ greatly from fact.  That would just eat away at a person of reason.

Relax and just let the science in.  Trust me, you'll sleep better! 




 That's a very short list.

The list of attacks by Islamists in America is much larger and from a smaller population.

Bayes Theorem says Islamists are more violent than the Tea Party.

 




 I'm awaiting your criticisms of Barrack and Michelle Obama taking separate Christmas vacations to Hawaii and Colorado requiring double the security staff and taxpayer expense.

George Bush stated he chose to stay in DC during Xmas so the hundreds of support and security staff could be with their families.

The Obamas? Not so much. 




 Please show me where Tea Party members have committed any acts of violence. 









 Sorry you can't tolerate a different viewpoint. 




 Another sob story from Michelle. 

She was so oppressed she had to settle for a Princeton education. 









 I'm sure he's traumatized. /s 




 Maybe you could ignore the post or respond intelligently instead of attacking the source.

Truth does not have a karma rating. 




 There are those here that have no problem with govt intimidation given it comes from Obama.

The IRS targeting political dissidents for example. 




 As usual, the liberals of Reddit do not wish to discuss the content of the article, only to attack the source and mock opposing viewpoints like good little Stalinists. 




 That's a convenient way to dismiss a viewpoint that doesn't coincide with your own.  Have a great day Stalin! 









 Yeah, let's ban different viewpoints! /s 









 Even Obama is embarrassed of this clown. 




 The Democrat Motto: Wahhhh!  It's just not fair! 




 This entire thread demonstrates the mantra of the American left:

Tolerance for those who agree with me. 




 Now we have Matt Damon. 




 Given the -100 karma is among naive Redditors who are still shitting high school food, I'll take that as a compliment. 









 Factual reason has been voted to the top and gilded?

Signing off before I'm disappointed again. 




 Lack of condemnation is condonation. 




 Reddit /r/politics: All for fighting against NSA spying unless a conservative is leading the charge. 




 Sanders wants to attack capitalism. Paul wants to attack an over reaching government.

I believe the latter is a greater threat to liberty. 









 The biggest mainstream fallacy in modern times is that evil does not exist any more. 




 The terrorists appreciate the sympathy from the Islamic apologists in /r/politics.
They will slaughter you last. 




 You're right!  I've edited the original post. 




 We've had a terrorist attack on our citizens on our own soil and not a peep from the President. 









 Sadly you are fighting the mathematics of demographics.

Get your burkhas while they're cheap. 




 Just because you personally have a belief doesn't mean it should be federal legislation.

Edited: This applies to everyone. 




 Britain is already lost.  Europe will almost entirely fail to Islamists within a century. 




 To all the downvoters:
Who will defend your rights when they are denied? 









 Funny you have no criticisms of the Islamists that wish to force their way of life upon you.  They are murdering innocents as we speak. 

Are you scared? 




 But let's get back to those intolerant Christians.  /s 














 Amazon rarely makes mistakes.

This is one of them. 




 There is a large swathe of Americans that support tyranny if it advances their agenda.

They think problems are solved with more and more and more federal government spending, power and programs. 









 Liberals literally cannot wipe their privates without a government program. 




 Just think, Obama wants to prevent employers from discriminating based on criminal history. 




 This is called anecdotal evidence and holds no merit whatsoever in forming an opinion one way or the other.

 




 Because people like Barack "If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. Period." Hussein Obama are still taken seriously. 




 At least when someone's kids burn alive because Ms. Wax is unable to  perform physically, the parents can comfort their anguish by knowing the NY Fire Department celebrates diversity. 




 And the politically correct fascist mob backs down.

In a free country one would be able to decide who to sell their property to. 









 Federal control of our schools is a colossal failure.

Disband the Department of Education. 














 "The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."

-Barack Hussein Obama 




 And this is why you are part of the 97% of America that would never physically resist fascism. 




 In before the gargling of Muslim semen by the naive Reddit 'intelligentsia'. 









 Maybe if they shot a black man with a criminal record Obama would help.  




 But centralized economic and social control is great!  Just ask a Democrat! 









 'The claim is just as bogus now'

The article has actual accounts of businesses closing as a direct result of the minimum wage hike.

Facts are your kryptonite aren't they? 




 This is insight that reveals a truth the American left does not understand: You can't control market forces and human nature through legislation. 




  When one business closes, another opens - happens everyday.

In this case, the new business opening will be in a different, more business friendly state. 




 Democrats have yet to understand that prosperity does not come from thin air.  It is created by business.

This wage hike, as many of us already know, will crush 100's of small businesses and increase unemployment.

 









 I'm sure he's 'such a good boy' too!! 




 He is most likely a loser that can't get anyone his own age. 




 After the witness being killed in Ferguson, I'm not surprised he's changing his story. 




 Being told to "let them loot" by the mayor is not a ground level tactic, but a policy. 














 I'm so glad the mayor gave these poor, disadvantaged youths 'room to destroy'.    /s 









 I wonder how many Redditors would support the stand down if their houses were being burned or heads being stomped. 









 Democrats. 




 Guess who she voted for? 




 Baltimore:Democrat controlled since 1967.

Poverty and dependence?  Yes we can! 




 Facts are kryptonite to Democrats. 




 But he was such a good boy!!! 




 There he goes again, lecturing us instead of inspiring and leading.

Amateur since day one. 




 /r/politics: Condoning Democrat crimes since 2005. 









 A glimpse into how our federal masters are living. 









 We just need to spread the wealth around a little more and Baltimore will flourish!   /s 



















 Don't text and drive! 




 They might as well let the players drink beer also.
