 [Meta] could we get dates next to the issues so we know which ones are current? 




 After numerous setbacks, the Great Wall of Liechtenstein is halfway to completion! Only the actual structure is halfway complete, the defenses and enforcements will take longer. The wall is expected to be completed in February of 2030. For now, the parts of the country that remain wall-less will be defended by a sturdy white picket fence. That is all.

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein /u/test_subject7429 




 This year was rather in eventful for Liechtenstein.

Our eternal leader unveiled his joint project with France, the AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicle. This vehicle can be exported to any country willing to pay and only France and Liechtenstein hold the rights to manufacture them.

Second and lastly, Hchste Kaiser offered refuge to monsoon victims and offered supplies and refuge to all involved in the Argentina conflict.

This has been Hchste Kaiser's Word 2022. Tune in next year for your only yearly choice in national news.

 Looks great, man! 




 Perfect. They'll arrive in 2 months. 




 Liechtenstein can build you AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicles for $600,000 each. 




 Then I assume we nominate/vote for new members. Though I don't know about anything since the chairman stepped down. 




 It's for the security council. Everyone can be in the alliance permanently, but the Sec Council has 3 permanent seats that have been voted on and 4 temporary ones that we vote on periodically.. 




 Liechtenstein would be honored to participate in this event. 




 Liechtenstein is deploying Spectres and SHIT squads all over the effected areas to help with rescue and relief efforts. We are also willing to take on a limited number of refugees and cooperate with other countries for more complicated relief operations. Finally, we'll be sending food, water, and medical supplies with the squads. 




 Liechtenstein will send a team of scientists and $500 million in support of this project. 




 The permanent seats are already filled though. And they're, you know, permanent. 




 Alright, then. We've sent all available scientists to help complete the project. 




 Liechtenstein would be willing to send scientists if not for a seat on the council then simply for the advancement of technology. 




 It was good, man 




 You can expect them in a month. 




 They should arrive within a month. 




 You should get them in a month. 




 You can expect them within the month. 




 The Hchste Kaiser had a chuckle. 




 Hchste Kaiser congratulates you on your coming to power and has sent you a 9x6 painting of himself. Stare at my beauty. 




 Liechtenstein is present and votes to officially recognize all proposed nations excluding Indonesia.

I would also like to propose that we discuss how to respond to various countries' (Iceland and Indonesia to name two) manufacturing of chemical weapons. 




 Today, Liechtenstein and France are proud to reveal the newest addition to their arsenal of military vehicles, the AT-23 Spectre. These lightly armored vehicles are capable of conquering even the roughest of terrain at a moderate speed in any weather. With brand new tire, shock, and suspension technology, this vehicle can go through much rougher terrain for longer periods of time than the older models. This vehicle will be able to hold up to 7 people, can support weapons attachments to the top of the vehicle, and is prepped for all environments. Liechtenstein is currently ready to mass produce and export to any country with any specifications. Average price per unit will be ~US$600,000. Currently only Liechtenstein and France hold the rights to build the AT-23 Spectre. 




 Aye for all four. 




 Sweet 




 Liechtenstein welcomes you to power and has sent you an invitation to he a guest judge on Liechtenstein's Next Top Model. Judge my women. 




 Question: as a normal member do I still have the ability to vote? Or is that just Security Council? 




 Liechtenstein congratulates your coming to power by sending you a jar of Hchste Kaiser's Own Raspberry Jam.  Spread it on your women. 




 I was ecstatic when I was able to find Liechtenstein! 




 To clarify, Liechtenstein is willing to take refugees from either side. 




 OK, thank you for clearing that up. 




 Due to lack of information, Hchste Kaiser has decided to refrain from armed participation in this conflict.  We are willing to take on refugees, but only a limited amount due to the size of our nation.  We will also be willing to deliver supplies to different countries depending on their standing with Liechtenstein. Besides that, Liechtenstein is taking no sides and will not participate in the actual fighting in this conflict.  

[Meta] Seriously, though, I have no idea what's going on or how this all started. 




 You will receive a formal invitation before the next season begins. 









 Oh, sweet! Thanks! 









 Welcome to your yearly programming of Hchste Kaiser's Word 2021! We're your new news team!

To start things off, the reason why we're here. At the beginning of the year, our great leader personally executed the previous mess team upon finding evidence that they were leaking confidential information to the terrorist organization that was attacking the country and other nations. He ended the executions stating that betrayal will never be tolerated.

On a lighter note, Liechtenstein announced the plans for its very own car company this year! So far all we know is that Kaiserwagen will be selling all over the world and will include cars of all types.

Next, the terrorist organization that had been attacking innocent civilians and government facilities has finally been out down. A defector informed The government of the organization's location and, upon further investigation, SHIT squads were sent in and all terrorists were either killed or captured. The next month after questioning, all captured members were personally executed by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429. The organization's leader was never named.

Continuing military news, the government revealed its intentions to design and mass produce a new military all terrain vehicle. The vehicle is being designed in collaboration between Loechtenstein and France and is expected to begin mass production within this next year. Designs have yet to be released.

On a much sadder note, our great leader revealed that he had, until recently, forgotten his own title. And then, to add insult to injury, Hchste Kaiser offered diplomatic relations to a leader that was no longer in power. The whole country joined our great leader to wallow in depression for a few days.

Well, that wraps it up for Hchste Kaiser's Word, your only choice in Liechtenstein news. Tune in next year.

Next: Hchste Kaiser Dancing With the Stars 




 Hchste Kaiser greatly appreciates the company. 




 News travels to Liechtenstein very slowly. Hchste Kaiser has retired to his home and has once again, begun binge eating ice cream and Taco Bell. He invites all of the country to join him in his embarrassment. 




 Despite the controversy that the seizing of power has caused, we believe that the instant decision to declare war on your nation is a very rash decision. Therefore, Liechtenstein would like to extend its congratulations and hopes that, upon the reopening of the borders, Luxembourg would be willing to peacefully negotiate trade relations amongst other things with the people of Liechtenstein.

Hopefully,

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429

Meta Edit: Shit. 




 Hchste Kaiser commends this decision from the AI. 




 ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Given Liechtentein and France's relations in the past, we'd be honored to join the ACE. 




 Devil and God's artwork is a photo by Nicholas Prior if you're interested. 




 As a welcome gift, Hchste Kaiser has sent you a minivan. Fill it with children. 




 Oh you! *blush* 




 [meta] well now I'm all excited to get home and do this. I hope my subpar drawing skills will be enough! 




 The Hchste Kaiser has just discovered that he has been spelling his own title wrong for years. He is currently in a fit of embarrassed depression, binge eating nothing but fast food and ice cream and watching Liechtenstein's Next Top Model. 




 [Meta] Exactly 




 Originally the time frame was to try and go into the mass production phase within one or two years (if that's realistic enough), but with your help it may be even faster. 

[meta] I'm planning on drawing something up when I get home later. 




 Liechtenstein accepts the offer. The investment and scientists will most certainly help speed up the research and prototype processes and help us move into the mass production phase much quicker. And of course, in exchange for the help, France gains the right to mass produce them on their own. 




 [meta] Mine is more of a Humvee than an AFV. Only like 1,000,000x cooler.  




 Excellent. We'll inform you as soon as your vehicles have been prepared.  




 We're planning on the vehicles to be lightly armored, most likely able to carry six people (maybe multiple sizes), able to support light weapons attachments, and we're researching new tire, shock, and suspension technology that can last longer and withstand rougher terrain. These vehicles can be painted however the receiving government sees fit and will arrive ready for operations. 




 ~signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein actually just announced its intentions to create a new all terrain vehicle for their own military. We'd be willing to export to you once production begins. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a German shepherd as a congratulatory gift for your coming to power. Pet him or offend me. 




 Starting next month Kaiserwagen will begin designing and producing all terrain vehicles for Loechtenstein's military. We hope for a lightly armored vehicle that can hold at least six men and support attachable firearms. These vehicles will, in theory, be able to maneuver Liechtenstein's mountainous terrain much easier than our current vehicles. Along with the vehicles, Kaiserwagen will be researching a new form of tire that will be more durable and last much longer in the rough terrain. Liechtenstein is accepting help with designs and has plans to export to anyone that inquires. 




 Good. Let our positive relations begin. 




 This is nothing new. Hchste Kaiser has personally executed many prisoners. Mostly those that have made personal threats or attacks on him. 




 Today, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 personally executed every captured member of the terrorist organization that had formerly been attacking innocents for well over a year. After the capture of their leader and the disbanding of the group, they were kept away from the public and questioned for just over a month. Early this morning, a verdict was reached and it was announced that they were all to be executed. At noon, all men, looking battered and beaten, were lined up and, one by one, shot by our eternal leader. The final execution was that of the organization's leader. His name was never released to the public. Hchste Kaiser explained right after executing the man that his name will never be public knowledge because, "He did not deserve the satisfaction of a legacy." 




 Hchste Kaiser welcomes you and has sent you a basket of many breads. Enjoy its wheaty goodness. 




 Hchste Kaiser despises the color yellow. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in joining. 




 What's the difference between small front overlap and moderate front overlap? 




 It is with great joy that I personally announce the end of the never-named terrorist group that attacked facilities and civilians all over the country. With the help of a defector from the group, we located their base of operations and SHIT squads were immediately sent in. The group was found to be much smaller then we had anticipated, just over 50 members. 

SHIT squads were met with gunfire upon entry and the majority of the group was killed in the ensuing firefight. The remaing 17 members, the still-anonymous leader included, were captured and taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation. Once questioning is through, punishment will be dispatched posthaste. Terrorism and betrayal to the nation won't nor will it ever be tolerated and the punishments these men receive will be just and deserved.

I personally invite all citizens of our great nation to celebrate with me. On this momentous day, a group of murderers was put to an end. Finally, we can rest and our country can return to the prosperity it knew before.

~Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein commends you for the way you think. 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent an annoyingly large bouquet of flowers as congratulations for your coming to power. Smell them or insult me. 




 Ok, I gotcha. I hope that's just as fun for you as being a country! 




 Well color me confused. 




 [Meta] So are you Madagascar again? 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent a pig in congratulations for your coming into power. Eat it. 




 Liechtenstein is authoritarian and capitalist. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in joining the alliance because it is against socialism. If its government ever becomes an issue, we are willing to leave. 




 For f***ing yourself or authoritarianism? 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent finger foods as congratulations for you (finally) coming to power. Eat them or hurt my feelings. 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent an assorted cheese platter as congratulations for you coming to power. Eat it or become my enemy. 




 Hchste Kaiser kindly tells your alliance to go f*** itself.  




 Sith Lord of Korriban is best lord of Korriban 




 How does the alliance feel towards authoritarianism? 




 Highest GDP per person, broOOoOOo 




 You don't got nothin' bro. Just silly accents. 




 NEW ENGLAND SUUUUUUCKS!!! 




 Hchste Kaiser is forever thankful of your gift. I will raise them as my own and train them to be my heirs upon my extremely unlikely death. We hope this means positive negotiations far into the future between our two great nations. 




 Go kick his ass and tell him that Madagascar is nothing without a leader 




 Kaiserwagen's catalogue will include all kinds of cars from the consumer minivan to super cars designed by the country's top engineers that will soon be available for purchase by people all over the world. Hchste Kaiser has given the company his blessing and hopes for its success in the long run. 




 Do it. You'll be immune to all diseases forever!! 




 What will happen to Baobabia now? 




 Mine was already there. Sorry, I just felt bad for not filling mine out yet. 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent a fruit bouquet as a congratulatory gift. Eat it or offend me. 




 You just reminded me that I need to fill mine out. I'll do that soon.
