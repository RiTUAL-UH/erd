 But we can say things like:

Here are reasons A, B, and C to go vegan. You will be in good company too! Former Vice President Al Gore and Senator Cory Booker are vegan. Google searches for the term vegan have risen sharply in the past few years. Even athletes like 9-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis has adopted a vegan diet. The mainstream is rapidly acknowledging the importance of choosing a compassionate, vegan lifestyle. 




 I'm not suggesting we say, "go vegan because it is normal." That clearly won't work.

I'm suggesting we still use logical arguments to advocate veganism, but also make it more palatable to people by reassuring them that they are making a decision that is normal. 




 The eggs that you eat are not fertilized so there is no need to worry about any baby chickens inside the eggs.

However, there are baby chickens dying in another sense. Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).

The story for dairy is much the same as with eggs. Cows only give significant amounts of milk for a period of time after birth, so they are repeatedly impregnated to keep up the milk production. The males do not produce milk, so they are separated from their mothers shortly after birth. Cows suffer greatly when separated from their young. [Here you can see a video of a mother cow crying for her calf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBnZPJJ2QG4). The male calves will be slaughtered and sold as veal.

Once again the milk production of dairy cows also drops off after a few years. As shown in the image above, they will also be sent to slaughter at a fraction of their natural life span. 




 You're right that whether or not something is seen as normal or weird is not a valid reason to determine whether that behavior is ethical, but these factors do play a role in whether people are willing to seriously consider the idea of veganism.

 [The United States is considering new dietary recommendations along those lines](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/19/eating-a-lot-of-meat-is-hurting-the-environment-and-you-should-stop-top-u-s-nutritional-panel-says/). 




 Look at my comment you responded to again. I did not cite Harvard as a source. 




 Yes, I did read the whole thing. Did you read the position paper of the American Dietetic Association yet?

EDIT: Also, how do you think the conclusion "The risks of feeding this excess protein don't seem to apply here" supports your claim that there is "growing evidence that meat is necessary for infant development?" The conclusion as written supports that idea that meat won't necessarily have a negative impact on infant health. 




 That is not a study I referenced. Are you sure this was supposed to be a response to me?

I am citing the position papers that the world's largest dietetic organizations have published on the subject of vegetarian and vegan diets. They have looked through all of the research on the subject to derive their conclusions citing hundreds of pieces of evidence to support their position. A handful of cherry-picked studies cannot refute these position papers. 




 **Objective:** We examined the effect of protein from meat as **complementary foods** on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants.

**Design:** This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants (56 mo old from the Denver, CO, metro area) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats (Meat group; n = 14) or infant cereal (Cereal group; n = 28) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo. 

It says there that the pureed meats and infant cereal were complementary to the breast feeding the infants were receiving. Did you read that and think that the mothers were eating pureed meats and infant cereal?

Also, something else you may have missed when you (didn't carefully) read these studies:

**Background:** High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity, which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy.

The study is stating that the excess weight and fat that infants gain from consuming dairy formula is a bad thing after the first few months (which is what this study was looking at). 




 [The law prevents much more than just taking samples on private property](http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/news/data-trespass-wyomings-fancy-name-for-ag-gag/). It has essentially stopped the collection of water pollution information in the state. 




 There is not growing evidence. You cited a handful of individual studies that were not looking at vegetarian or vegan diets as a whole.

For example your first study has a sample size of 14 infants fed meat and 28 infants fed cereal. It concluded that their meat diet had more protein than the cereal diet therefore the protein contributed to more growth. If they had fed a higher protein non-meat food, then they would expect the non-meat food to contribute to more growth. 

Compare that to the American Dietetic Association's position paper that cites over 200 studies to support their position. My sources are reputable experts in the dietary field that have conducted reviews of all the literature. It is not some study that you or I are trying to take out of context to support our position. Can you find a similarly reputable organization that has reviewed all of the literature and come to a conclusion that supports your position? 




 A substantial number of animals in slaughterhouses are not stunned properly by the captive bolt guns that are commonly used, and continue down the kill lines fully conscious. 

Many meat eaters also eat Halal or Kosher meats as well as chickens that are killed without any stunning, but simply have their necks slit and are allowed to painfully bleed out while fully conscious. 

Another fairly common technique is controlled atmospheric killing. [Here you can see footage of that process from Australia's largest pig slaughterhouse](https://youtu.be/KArL5YjaL5U?t=1h23m13s).

Speaking hypothetically, if someone kills one animal to send a message, and in turn convinces others to change their behavior enough to save 10 animals from suffering in ways like that shown in the footage above, would you consider their action justified?

and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 Are you saying you like eating animals and that you intend to continue doing simply what you enjoy with no regard to the impact your actions have on others, or do you genuinely not believe that you can live without eating animals? 




 We don't need to eat animals. 




 Ultimately your weight loss is still going to depend upon how many calories you are taking in and how many you are burning, but vegetarian diets do provide structure that helps many people manage the calories they take in. [Vegans and vegetarians are much more likely to be a healthy weight than non-vegetarians](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12833118) as a result. [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource to use for adopting a vegetarian diet. 




 There are millions of Americans who are vegan right now and [interest in veganism is rising quickly](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=vegan). 

Many animal rights groups are working to make cages a little bigger and conditions a little better for animals while people still do eat meat, but ultimately our long term goal should be to move beyond supporting this system of animal mistreatment altogether.  




 The only option available if I want to encourage mainstream companies like Ben and Jerry's to keep making vegan products while still supporting vegan companies is for me to double my consumption of ice cream. 

The sacrifices I make for the animals...

 I'm not sure selfish is better than hypocrite.  




 [More happy chickens](http://i.imgur.com/99X3uRh.gifv) 




 Virtually all hens in commercial egg operationswhether cage or cage-freecome from hatcheries that kill all male chicks shortly after hatching. The males are of no use to the egg industry because they don't lay eggs and aren't bred to grow as large or as rapidly as chickens used in the meat industry. Common methods of killing male chicks include suffocation, gassing and grinding. Hundreds of millions of male chicks are killed at hatcheries each year in the United States. 




 I enjoyed the taste of meat, but I wasn't okay with the things that were being done to animals in order for traditional meats to be produced. Things that taste like meat, but don't cause harm to animals are a win-win! 




 Yeah, I downvote this. 




 Like I said, I post things that I enjoy and that I think other people will also enjoy. There's nothing sinister to my motives. 




 What was the title of this post?  




 How would you phrase it if you wanted to make clear that eating animals was not acceptable while not having people on the internet perceive your attitude as "holier than thou"? 




 The majority of your submissions appear to be combat scenes. The majority of my submissions are about animals or animal rights. We both post about what interests us. You keep your gruesome military footage in /r/combatscenes where it belongs, and I submit cute animal gifs to /r/aww where it also belongs.  




 I literally spend 8 hours per day working. I also have been spending a lot of my free time running /r/SummerScavengerHunt lately. In my remaining time I submit content that I have enjoyed and that I think other redditors will enjoy too. Judging by the response to my submissions I have done a pretty good job of this.

Sorry if some of my submissions have offended you, but I'm not going to stop contributing just because a small number of people dislike my submissions. 




 There is wide consensus among dietary experts that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. If we can live happy, healthy lives while causing less harm to animals, why wouldn't we? 




 Never! 




 Can't go wrong emulating the behaviors of our ancestors. /sarcasm 




 I'm assuming that /u/Bhadoom was referring to the cow. I'm pretty sure she is vegetarian, although I'm not so sure about the Greenpeace bit. 




 Most of us would stop to help a bird with a broken wing who was suffering on our front lawn, but many of us pay companies for products knowing that a great deal of suffering is caused to animals in the process. We know that chickens suffering in factory farms and slaughterhouses suffer much like the bird on your front lawn, so why should there be this disconnect in our actions? 















































































  In fact, the animals in farms get to LIVE LONGER than they would in the wild

[No, no, no](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg)

Here's what I propose: Start treating other animals like individuals whose lives have value of their own, independent of what they can provide to you. 




 And no dairy or egg farm is keeping animals alive for their full life span anyway. Once their production begins to drop the dairy cows and egg laying hens are inevitably sent to slaughter. 




 Do you have a peer reviewed journal article where dogs were assigned to groups that were fed either an appropriately planned vegan diet or a standard diet, and then the long term health outcomes of both groups were monitored?

If not, then how about accepting what the best evidence currently available suggests. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) and /r/vegan are good places to start. 




 [Let's ask PetMD](http://www.petmd.com/blogs/nutritionnuggets/jcoates/2014/jan/can-dogs-stay-healthy-on-a-vegetarian-diet-31188)!

 Richard Dawkins has a great essay titled [Gaps in the Mind](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/dawkins01.htm), which discusses the flaws behind this sort of "every human before any  non-human animals" reasoning. 




 Those militants on the internet are asking questions that I don't want to answer! They are literally ISIS!! 




 I wouldn't date someone who wasn't vegan.
