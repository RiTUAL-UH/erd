 No, I just thought of the worst, nonsensical ending to work into this. I just thought of all the popular YA fiction types (supernatural, demigods, vampires and dragon riding) to work into a OP and shit character. I actually like Damian, the daft bastard he is. Sometimes it's good to write a weird character. 




 Hey Redditors,

My family and I are traveling to Japan, and we are wondering how to get around Japan, in particular how can we get around the language barrier? 

Thanks 




 God this was shite. Really hard for me to write badly. 




 "Damian Faulksworth. You are the son of Athernax, the dragon riding vampire god." my mom said. I gasped. Gods weren't real. Lian dropped down from the roof adjacent to us, her cat ears twitching. Her long black hair made my abnormally pale skin flush and I felt my canines begin to extend. 

"Damian, you're fangs!" Lian gasped, her tail twitching. "They're extending! That means-" 

"Yes, you and Lian must get to the Summer School for Half-Bloods and Magical Creatures (tm)!" mom shouted, branishing a shotgun. "I'll cover you two while you make a run for the bus run by Hermes!" I swallowed a sob. "Mom, you can't make me go!" Lian grabbed my hand and pulled me across the street, out of the alleyway and into the biggest kiss of my life. Our lips mashed together and I felt our tongue's battle in each other's mouths, like my sword fighting championships I'd won the past. We disentangled ourselves from each other and gasped. 

"I love you." Lian said, her skin flush and red. I nodded. "I know, but I'm a vampire demigod who rides dragons, we can't be together." I said, looking away. Lian giggled. "I'm a 300 year old cat-girl who can fly and breath fire. We were made for one another." I smiled and grew my vampire wings, taking Lian into my arms. We flew off into the night and never looked back.    




 Hey Redditors,

My friends and I are working on a series revolving around Dragon Riders, and we were wondering if we can find any good places for information about the subject that isn't related to 'Eragon' or the 'How to train your dragon' bullshit. Thanks, any input is appreciated!  




 Magicwise, I don't want them to be too powerful in regards to magic. I was thinking about going the Sir Pratchett route and making them overstuffed idiots, but then I turned to you guys. Politically, they function like the American senate. 




 Hey Redditors,

I'm working on the government for my world, and I'm wondering what a mageocracy is and how it can work without the wizards and mages being too powerful.  




 Well, Dark Elves are friendly in my setting, but maybe 'The Lodge' could be run by an evil faction, like A.I.M. in Marvel comics.  




 Dude, totally. Everytime I sit down to watch the show, I'm distracted. 




 Aquaman has never looked so sexy 




 Hey Redditors, 

I need some help coming up with some names for two magic labratories in my setting. One is run by Dark Elves and is more about designing and testing military tech (crossbows, elemental staves, swords, ect.), and the other is run by several different races and devoted to studying magical anomalies and new species of magic animals and plants. 

Thanks!

"Greetings from Jupiter harvest station 34. This Risich Dorun, the drone mantinance worker. Today was uneventful but drone 17 stopped transmitting earlier. I don't really know why, but I've sent a few tow pods to bring it back. Aside from that, Martyn my corgi has been perfectly adorable! If your watching this mom, thanks! I've got to go now, coffee break and then back to drone control!"

 "Hey viewers. Drone 17 came back today, but something is wrong with the video card. I ran the imaging though the computer and- well- it's weird. It shows the usual swirling gas clouds of Jupiter, but in one frame, for a millisecond, there's this shape in the clouds; like a tendril of something reaching towards the camera, but in the other frames it's gone. I've called my boss, La Runa and shown her the footage,but she doesn't believe me. Then again, it is a little far fetched. I'm going to send a few more E.Y.E. drones to the area and go to bed."

"Viewers, something is wrong. I awoke to the screech of sirens and ran to the control panel to see that all five E.YE. drones are offline. I've tried to access the video feeds, but nothing is working. At first I thought it was the Rad Storm that was sweeping through tonight, but the E.Y.E. drones can't be effected by electromagnetic storms. Something is- oh god. Dear listeners, something just slammed against my ship. Martyn is now barking like mad and I can hear the crunch of metal as whatever horror is outside. I am looking at my control panel and the airlock has just been broken into. The emergency environmental seals have been activated, keeping the air in the ship but whatever has broken the airlock is now inside the ship. I can't hear footsteps but- Viewers, I can hear a low, dull droning noise outside my control room door and Martyn has stopped barking and is now cowering beneath my desk. I- "

 I've had some ideas on how the mutants were born. I might write them someday. 




 Hey Redditors,
I've been working on a science fiction universe for several years (middle school-college) and I'm finally ready to talk about the technology. The universe has a 'space western' theme to it, with a dash of modern tech (think Borderlands, but with updated computers ). Humans have colonized various planets in a new galaxy, but megacorperations are the governing force further out. I had the idea  to make 3D printing like a vending machine. The megacorps set up these house sized printers with scanners that can scan and then print out parts to vehicles and then assemble them with robotic arms. That's all I have time to write now, but feel free to suggest anything in the comments!

Thanks for reading!    




 The strength of the spell depends on the skill of the caster, willpower of the target and can only effect living targets, not intimate objects or the undead. You do stay sentient as the animal, but your clothing will either be left behind after the transformation or if the caster is strong enough. 




 Alright, the elements mentioned in the second paragraph are subtypes of the original four. And science is a big theme in the universe as a whole, and there is actually an explanation for 'ice' being a seperate type from 'water'. I have also decided to add 'classes' of elementalists.  
1. Animators. These elementalists have the ability to form and manipulate their element into a 'golem' or construct to fight for or with them. 
2. Pulverizers. These elementalists can use their element to devestating effect in combat by forming fists or smashing constructs to hit at a close range. 
3. Sharp shooters. These elementalists can focus their element into a consentrated blast and attack from afar, dealing precision damage. 
4. Blasters. These elementalists use their elements to strike hard and fast, causing collateral damage. 
5. Protectors. These elementalists use their element to form shields or spheres of protection.  




 For mass, I was thinking that the extra mass is shunted to another dimension. However, clothes and weapons aren't changed, it's only the person who is transformed. 




 Hey Redditors,

I'm working on a mage character(he's deliberatly terrible at magic; think Rincewind but with extreme self estem issues), and a friend of mine suggested that the only spell he knows should be a polymorph spell. Any examples I can draw from? And how does polymorph magic work in your settings? 




 Water and ice 'elementalists' need to get the water from somewhere in the enviroment. Air elementalists can use surrounding air, Fire elementalists need some sort of lighter or firestarter to use their abilities, but once they ignite something they can control the fire. Earth elementalists can control amounts of rock, soil ect, but they need to be in contact with it. And as for the other elements I have in mind heres a list

Lighting, toxic chemicals, light, darkness, ice, crystal, plants/wood, certain types of metals, sound and the aforementioned radiation. In the story itself, there are five 'ultimate' elements that are just legends. Gravity, time, space and void.   




 I'm a English student currently at a community college and about to transfer to UNT. I have a part time job as a dishwasher that's helping me write by giving me time to think about plots and characters.  




 How do you do it? 




 Hey Redditors,

Working on a new series based in a future world. Humanity has branched out across the galaxy and some people and alien species developed elemental abilities. I need help finding cool ways to show off various abilities, like using fire to light lanterns, radiation to melt metal ect.  




 Thanks! However, I have another book in the works, so this one is a few years away. 




 The Civil War is still going on, but the war is because of the aforementioned artifact pieces. And race is still a major issue and the older generation is insanely racist.    




 Utility magic is more like energy that's used in everyday life. For example utility magic can be bottled and used to power a lantern. A mutant's magic is random and is more like a superpower and control is dependent on the skill of the user. They are born with a natural connection to magic, like speedsters and the Speed Force. 

Dragons can fly and are similar to elephants in that they understand their owners and tend not to fly away. However, some dragons are fitted with a collar that prevents them from wandering off by generating a magic containment field if they go too far. And yes, for the most part dragons are domesticated, but some species can't be tamed and remain wild. 
 




 Hey reddit users, I was walking home from school today and I just got an idea for a novel, I want to throw it out there and see what everyone's reaction is. So, it's set in Old West America, around the 18 hundreds. Dragons are real and are commonly used for various reasons. The larger ones,(the size of elephants) are used as pack animals for settlers. The medium sized ones (about the size of a cow or horse) are used for transport and mail carrying. And then there are small dragons, around the size of a lap dog or cat, are used for companionship.
Magic is used in place of electricity and is only just being used for utility proposes around the time of the story. Artifacts holding mystical properties are rare and are valued to the point of small turf wars breaking out for one, no matter what it can do. People can also be born with magic abilities, but they're essentially like Mutants, hated and feared.
Slavery was abolished a century before normal and as a result interracial marriage is becoming popular, despite the previous generation being against the practice. However, the civil war has broken out over a two piece powerful artifact found on the North and South border. Since both sides want the whole artifact for themselves, war broke out.
In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a young man named Ezekiel. He was the son of a Native American woman and a African American man, but was orphaned due to an outbreak of a mystery illness that almost killed him. Now, at 19, Ezekiel and a few other orphans from his hometown join the Pony Express. Aside from delivering letters, Ezekiel wants to find out more about the mystery illness that killed his family. He gets his opportunity when his dragon becomes sick and he's forced to stay in a small western town called Griffin Gulch. 




 Thanks! 




 I stood before the kitchen entrance, hands gripping my coffee mug. 'Hang in there' said the kitten on the wall adjacent from me. I cast a fleeting glance at my cubicle, my only solid rock in this turbulent office. Then I locked eyes with Annie. As beautiful as a elven princess and fair as a summer's day. I felt a tear slid down my cheek. I might not come back from this. I mouthed the words 'I love you' and entered the unholy realm of foodstuffs.

 I saw the object of my prize and moved as quickly as my weary legs could take me towards the Machine of Coffee, a lantern of hope and power in a bleak and grey world. I slid my kitten mug under the spout and pressed the 'pour' button. Annie's fair visage passed by the doorway and I looked away from my prize for a second. A second too late, as the overweight, foul smelling Orc known as Pam the devourer. She slapped my mug out from the Machine with a fat paw and slid her own thermos in it's stead. Rage built within me as I picked up my mug and bashed it against hers. It became a battle of mugs as neither of us were going to let this sweet, brown nectar of the gods go. Then Mark of Accounting came in, a white box of doughnuts in his hands. My eyes narrowed. A new foe had entered the battle. This means war.    









 Dude, so proud of you! 




 When I was a little boy, I always got 'vibes' from people, especially those I'm close to, like my mother. I sometimes would mimic those emotions without any form of control. As a result, I became with drawn and read books to try and block out arguments or strong emotions. Animals also loved me and still do, but I never quite got along with other kids. Then I met a girl in High School who told me about aura readings. I was smitten with her, and over three years we learned about ESP abilities. I suspected that I was and empath, but I never got proof until today. 




 Hey Redditors,

Is there anyway I can subtly alter people's emotions by emitting an aura that matches it? And how can I see someone's aura?
