 It amazes me that the war of minds is so simple. Run a headline like this, immediately drum up support for intervention. Run a headline that the United States destroys a civilian building and kills hundreds, it only drums up excuses at best.

I guess senseless murder is only evil when it's the other people doing it.

 




 Uh huh.
