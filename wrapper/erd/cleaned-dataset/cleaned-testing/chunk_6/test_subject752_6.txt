 Maybe not a proper PSA, but even if you're like me and don't believe in the commercial aspect, just turn up at her door and remind her she still has a son or daughter with a hug and some flowers from the ~~neighbours~~ garden. :) 




 Haha, good memory! [To remind everyone, Apple agrees to pay $450 million to settle ebook price fixing lawsuit](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450m) 




 Apple doesn't give a shit about piracy, they give a shit about making more money than anyone else. 




 The scary thing is though Apple honestly believe they are **above** the law. And they have friends in very very high places.... 









 What the fuck?  (_) 




 Unfortunately the NZ public have just put up a rod for our own back by not adequately backing alternatives. (Not helped of course by extremely piss poor launch campaigns. Here's looking at you Wheedle.) 














 What browser do you use? A lot of websites have iPhone optimised versions that significantly lowers the bandwidth. 




 Actually as a side effect, can see less dairy farms as highly beneficial for our environment. 

[There have been many studies which found increased dairy farming is categorically devastating our waterways.](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/9423728/Dairy-farming-harming-water)

Or in the very least it may force Farmers to pull finger and act more efficiently in order to better utilize their farms.

I obviously realise there are many which are looking to the future already with smarter more ecologically friendly farms, and I salute those making an effort.  




 TradeMe is flawed anyway, and run by some seriously childish fuckwits.

 Let's put it this way:

* You have 2 men, manually flying a 280 ton aircraft.
* They have some 350 souls entirely trusting these 2 men with their lives.

* The pilots always have 1 ear out listening to ground control 
* They have another ear listening other aircraft.
* And another listening for the other pilot.
* They also have are listening for error alerts.
* Both eyes are constantly scanning their instrument panel.
* Both eyes are constantly scanning the horizon to orientate themselves and look for danger
* And they're gripping the yoke tightly with both hands.

 Oh lordy. He needs to repeat this to himself each morning:

**Sometimes it's better to shut up and look stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.** 




 Good point. I had forgotten that little attention seeking outburst. 









 Honestly had no idea (but I don't watch that shit anyway) he was being "exploited". So i googled his name and xfactor only this news article comes up, so I kinda have to ask now after this has gone viral, who's exploiting who?  




 Rude.  




 Failing to see why it's the staff's responsibility to keep track of a grown man. 

I'm sure the Interislander is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn't. The only way I can see to stop this happening is to ensure you hold a ticket of sorts which is stamped and crossed off vs a passenger list when you leave. (I haven't use the service but presume this isn't happening.) so while they could enact such a measure valid travelers would be severely inconvenienced by this.

And further more, by the time it reaches the destination, chances are (if he disembarked early enough) he'll be swept far out to sea.

I understand the Widow is pissed off and wants to blame someone, but at what point do we have to say shit, there's no point blaming the company as any measures taken to avoid such accidents are just pointless given if someone ultimately wants to kill themselves they will circumnavigate any measures put in place.

 It's pretty appalling, there's zero evidence of any scientific investigation that the Antarctic can sustain this method of fishing whatsoever, and may ultimately decimate the krill population in these areas for decades.

Of course this isn't known for certain, but there is a balance, between krill population and predators, and humans are proposing to severely disrupt that balance for what? Animal food and omega3 tablets? Awesome. 




 I agree the Comcom are partly to blame here for allowing them to do this, Orion are being greedy fucks to begin with, and lying to the Comcom didn't help - they argued the increase was needed to pay for Quake damaged infrastructure, taking on more debt to pay out a $80M dividend I would take at odds to propping up the infrastructure? Hence my frustration at Orion, not the Comcom. 




 They do, but they didn't request the price rise, Orion did. I took your comment like it was the comcom who set the price independent from Orion. 




 Sorry you're wrong there, see TVNZ article from 2013:
[Orion New Zealand Ltd has asked the Commerce Commission if it can increase its prices by 15% or around $8.50 per month for an average customer.](http://tvnz.co.nz/business-news/orion-proposes-power-price-hike-5533171) The ComCom did however strike this down and proposed a smaller 8.4% instead. 




 No, I did not make myself clear -  quite the opposite I wonder if they had pay deducted for not getting through a set amount? 

As your comment is apt - the general attitude is at odds with their pay rate. 




 Judging the way things were run by the arrogant fucktards paid by EQC (who by the way were paid like $75 **per hour**) I'd bet my left nut there was a financial incentive (or penalty) for getting through as many houses as quick as possible. 




 Family friends had a run in with this cuntbag, he had a smug fucking "I am God" attitude. Didn't even look at the fucking house, take measurements, just eyeballed it and said the infamous "This isn't earthquake damage!" Made them feel like criminal just for lodging a claim. They appealed and got their own engineer to take a look. In limbo last I heard.

From my understanding, this is the guy they bring in to browbeat people into submission. Fucking sheer arrogance personified.

Honestly hope he burns in hell for the shit he's put the chch through. 




 Eh? 









 Treating the justice system like a pick and mix isn't how it's to be used.

 Use clean master to delete app cache, I got the same problem recently "there is insufficient space on the device"?  




 Your battery could be stuffed. Try a mates battery? (if possible?) 
Try scratching your battery contacts with a sharp knife/pin?  




 A few things:

Glass screen protector is a must.

Buy a usb 3 cable as (at least for me) it didn't come with one in the box, which literally defies the point of having it..

To save battery life don't forget to disable "Samsung push service" and disable "auto update" in the Samsung app store, or it will reinstall itself.

Um.. If you're not used to using an amoled screen, I use Reddit sync with the specifically designed amoled theme (it's quite dark) which saves a considerable amount of battery life.

That's all for now off the top of my head.
Enjoy your new device!  




 That is the true tragedy indeed. 
Edit: did more research, and realized I was ignorant myself. Edited comment. 




 Disrespectful cuntbags. How fucking arrogant could you be? Fuck. 

They have no idea what so ever how hard life was for these soldiers, who were young, and died horribly. They deserve significantly more respect than this.

Send these fucktards to the front line in Afghanistan, no bullet proof vests, a full clip and the shirt on their back.

Then let them come back once they realize what respect for your fallen countrymen actually means.

 Why? 

They are squeaky clean from the whole thing. Fucking assholes.
 




 They do 'random' audits to ensure you don't owe them money.
However the biased fuckbags can and will fuck you over first chance they get.

For instance I was told a wee while back I had been audited (I can't recall exact years, but it was something like..) 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005. I didn't owe them anything so was squeaky clean. Oh, they didn't audit 2003 because they owed me about $500 for that year. 




 Yeah, pretty much.

 Hi /r/Android I know we're not a help centre, but there's a lot of battery misinformation out there, I thought a post which contains some good info might be good to clear the air, and feel free to add your own tips and tricks.

* You don't need to charge your shiny new device straight from the box. In fact every cellphone I've ever come across since 2010 comes precharged to around 60%. 

    [Source: Li-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

* Charging every night will not ruin your battery life. The key word here is **ruin**. Unable to find any conclusive proof however. Your battery will charge to 100% and then the charger will switch off, and your phone will discharge over many hours to a preset level before the charger will flick back on and take it back up to 100%. As the source indicates, these 'microcharges' can be performed thousands of times with negligible impact to the battery capacity.  
    [Source: See Table 2 which indicates charging 10% can be done thousands of times](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)

* Extra reading: However as evidence has [found it is best to have your device off and remove it once charged.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

* Charge your phone in Offline mode (or ultra-battery saving mode if you have it) will significantly speed up charge time. Really handy if you don't have a lot of time and just need a quick boost. 

    [Source](http://www.instructables.com/id/Will-An-iPhone-Charge-Faster-On-Airplane-Mode/)

* If you've forgotten your charger, but have your cable at a hotel chances are the TV will have a USB port you can use in a pinch. (Or if there are limited power outlets and you have multiple devices to charge at once) 
    [Source](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/07/charge-your-usb-gadgets-through-the-tv-in-your-hotel-room-when-travelling/)

* Try to avoid excessive heat unnecessarily. For instance never leave your phone in the sun on your dashboard, or by a window. Batteries really don't like being hot for very long. Once or twice is ok, but don't go making a habit of it. 

    [Source: "Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat.." Table3](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)

* If your phone has a tendency to randomly shut down, there is a chance your battery contacts have become too bad and need to be scratched. I've seen cellphones that wouldn't charge or turn on at all come to life immediately after lightly scratching the contacts with a sharp pin or knife.

    [Source: actually my own experiences working for 3 years in a consumer electronics store.]

* Modern smartphones feed usually as fast as the charger can give it. As a result if you're hunting for a charger look for a higher amperage.

    [Source: "Increasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much...A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent." ](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

That's all I can think of for now, there is a lot of misinformation out there and thought /r/Android could be a trustworthy place for others to be confident about their battery usage. 




 That explains why Ilam road was so damn quiet at lunch! 




 Better camera API.  




 I hope not too.. 









 This was 5 years ago, when they actually had some shred of decency. 




 This was 5 years ago!  














 Between 2 and 3 percent (quick Google) are allergic to milk. You reckon they would alienate their buyers just to satisfy a potential 2 or 3 percent?  



















 I see what you did there. 




 As I'll keep repeating in all these threads - our distances are deceptive. Add a good 1hr to most Google estimates for trips.

It's a stunner of a road to take, prepare with warm clothes should you get stuck, but as pointed out a decent frost in the shadows of those hills can make even a light rain or mist turn to black ice really quickly.

Make sure your spare is pumped up and ready to go should you come off the road/get a flat. Look at hiring some chains, but it is only May so you should be fine.

If you have the time, take the longest route you can, as I said the drive is just beautiful.

Prepare to take breaks, agree before hand to only drive from X to X before the other person takes over. 

If you don't know the road, as it can be windy pull over and let the locals pass, they ~~might~~ will ride your ass if you're too slow.

And finally look for any waterfalls along the route, they can take an extra half hour to get to a random waterfall somewhere but it will stick with you for the rest of your trip!


*edit* FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PREPARE TO PUT YOUR CHAINS ON BEFORE YOU LEAVE! If you have to put chains on and you've never used them - it can take 30 minutes + the first time. That was in the garage at home. Fuck doing it for the first time ever in the snow, and then trusting your life to them..... 




 Red and black - Crusader colours. :) 




 First thing I disable. Plus books, games.. Etc. All that bloatware bullshit. They're clever buggers though, you also need to go into the Samsung App store and untick "automatically update my apps" as that will just reinstall it! 




 For a hit and run though? But probably. 




 Indeed. This just doesn't feel right ay.

I'm not trying to victim blame here, but I and everyone I know would be utterly outraged at this asshole who tried to run me over I'd ring 111 immediately! 

Not to mention she "fell asleep" which indicates a life threateningly serious concussion. She could have died and didn't think to take herself or demand to be taken to the  hospital!?!?!?!?!? 




 It's still going.. Still not getting texts from my wife on 2 degrees.

So while fucking horrible, the police must have found probable cause? Or they are just being cunts and throwing the book at her cause they have nothing better to do.

Dunno. I daresay we'll find out. 


































 The thought process of your average Kiwi driver.

**Green light**

* Ok, send that last text message. It's very important to ensure your friend doesn't think you're ignoring you.
* Put your foot on the brake, take car out of park and into reverse
* Swear a few times as you once again attempt to put into drive.
* Let the car coast forward slightly as you don't like the lurch of the accelerator.
* Gently depress the accelerator pedal.
* Off you go.

**Orange light**

* What orange light? Last I looked it was green.
* Fuck it, I'm already 3 seconds from the intersection, that's not enough to stop!
* Screw it, it's green enough.
* As the light turns red.. I am GOD. Mere mortals stop for me.

**Red Light**

* Let's stop 15 feet from the car in front. Cause I may want to slowly coast forward. Or not. Either way I like the choice.
* Ooh, I have a red, but a green arrow! Let's lurch forward!  YAY!!!
* Ah it's still red. Back to texting. 




 Fuck the world. Spend the next 2 hours looking through [cute kittens playing with wool](http://child-of-artemis.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/cute-baby-kittens-playing-with-yarn.html)

 Thanks Op, commenting to look at work tomorrow. (I work at an nz energy provider, but don't dabble too much in this side of things very often and enjoy it when I get to.) 




 They way I see it is they went to the cheapest lower bidder and got burnt after having them hand made in Chch for many years with no problems at all.  




 No, which is ridiculous they 'create' a tenuous link between the two and report them as if they've found then smoking gun when some nutjob goes and kills someone! 




 Indeed.  




 I understand $35 million dollars is a significant investment, so while I can empathetic, I'm struggling to muster sympathy.

They are as you point out following the "rules" but ironicaly I believe it's the current rules set by the media companies in regards to contracts and agreement prices for set television shows (to ensure they get the best price possible) that is actually working heavily against the on-sellers like Lightbox etc. 

I get the uneasy feeling the media companies themselves I'm sure don't want to see a Spotify-like company crop up as that might be seen as devaluing their product (E.g. Television shows) however much they actually make. 

You can't really argue against them (such is the profit driven Hollywood Corporations attitude) which makes acquiring the TV shows and charging a reasonable price almost impossible as I'm sure they place certain strict caveats against how much you can charge/how you can provide the content via DRM etc.

However having been just a mere fly on the wall viewing geographic paywalls slowly disintegrating for a few years now you have to wonder why their research didn't better understand the current market trends, and look at successful content providers such as Spotify or Netflix and working with/against the DRM restrictions to provide a middle ground that meet the demands of the consumers with the requirements of the corporations you're buying the product from.

I will happily admit it's admirable of them to be attempting to penetrate the pirate ridden waters of on-line media, I just feel this article justify their position to be somewhat farcical. 




 What a complete bullshit article.
Your product is only ever as good as someone wants to pay for it. 

You simply cannot come to the party late, holding stale produce and complain when noone buys it.

Where was Lightbox 3 years ago? That was when the market was waking up to the fact we are no longer a captive market, around the same time as Adidas [basically made a sign with a giant middle finger and said FUCK YOU NZ](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/5410579/Adidas-stands-by-All-Blacks-jersey-price) you will pay what I fucking you tell you to pay by setting their RRP at a substantial rate above anywhere else in the world.

No, enough is enough. The internet has no geographical barriers, you can no longer justify business models that charge more simply because the IP comes from a different country. 

And then when you do compete with the free and open available of content internet in this day you better bring the big guns.

Take for instance Spotify, they very carefully judged their audience and have an advertising supported, and a pay-as-you-go business model. The key reason they have survived and thrived for so long is they are smart about it. They don't limit your listening to certain tracks for Free customers or paid, they limit the functionality instead.

Why lightbox etc are still insisting on the archaic model of limiting content (and relatively speaking very out of date content at that!) to buying customers only is just beyond me. 

You can't justify an aging business model with "Well the current system sucks, so I'm not going to change" cause that's just bullshit.

You can't sell water in a rainforest. We are no longer the captive market they love to price gouge off. 
Companies are attempting to justify an increase in price just because they want someone to pay that much.
