 Yes 




 From all the bad batches I keep hearing about from here and there, I'm sure as fuck not venturing out and trying a new vendor anytime soon lol. I'm content enough as it is, even if some people say it's mediocre (which I don't think it is), at least I know what I'm getting.  




 I don't mind the taste, I just dislike the texture of a finely ground powder. I like my kratom coarse. Luckily my recent kilo is some of the coarsest I've had lol. 




 Floppycock syndrome. 




 Yeah, I find it strange that people think a find grind is a selling point lol. 




 That's how you know it's good. 




 You have a trust fund? Can I have some money? I give a great handjob.  




 I prefer coarse kratom. I find it easier for toss and wash. I could see why somebody who makes tea would like the finely ground variety, though. 




 I'm the same way, I can take all the red veins I want, and I can take green Bali, but any other green and any white veins make me feel like shit.. along with Maeng Da, too. I'm so envious of people that can take a white or green vein and catch a good energy buzz before work. I'm always falling asleep on my fuckin way to work. Lol. I would like to take just Bali in the mornings but more than a couple grams of it gives me fuckin nausea.  




 TIL red vein kratom is also known as Maeng Da, and you have to ingest twenty grams of it to get any effects. 




 It stopped happening to me ever since I quit doing somersaults. 




 Knotted Johnson.       http://www.lovebryan.com/friends/brunt/data/upimages/hippiespenismold.jpg 




 No problem. 




 Yeah I got it today, I took it with 2 g of green Bali and 2 g of red vein Thai. I wasn't impressed lol. 




 Drug of choice 




 What 




 You should have said "HEY. I DON'T COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND TELL YOU HOW TO TICKLE BONERS." 




 I don't like guides that try to get me to buy stuff. 




 Yeah, he obviously has some deep-seated issues. I attempted to skim through all his drivel and I'm pretty sure he's on probation and he lives in Florida where kratom might be outlawed soon. He'll have to come to terms with his own drug dependence soon and he's afraid, so he's lashing out. Hey, this armchair psychology stuff is pretty fun. I can almost see why he does it. Wait... no... no, I can't. He's just a stupid asshole. Yes. That's it.  




 Lol I know man. I commented in your defense on that thread. The sad thing is, he's not just a troll, he actually believes the things he's saying. I think he may be mentally retarded. 




 Yeah, everybody else is deluded. It's not just you or anything.  




 SWIM knows exactly how it is. 




 Oh shit. I forgot all about Opiophile. I was more of a Bluelight man myself. 




 Dude. There was a couple times I made the mistake of browsing the "dope porn"  over at /r/opiates. I was ready to hit the fucking darknet. That was almost as bad as seeing it in person. If I didn't have kratom, it would have been over. 




 So he chooses to be on kratom instead of hard drugs, and you say he's doing the wrong thing... yet you're forced to resort to kratom because you aren't allowed to do hard drugs, and you think you're doing the right thing? That's definitely backwards junkie mentality if I've ever seen it. You're just a fiend doing whatever substances you can get away with. Admitting you're a junkie doesn't make your actions better than his. Stop glorifying yourself. 




 Idk why the fuck you didn't take a picture of it man.  




 You obviously have a way with words. 




 Toss and wash. Is there any other way?' 




 I feel sharper on kratom, especially compared to opiates. On opiates I spend the majority of my time with my face resting in a bowl of ice cream.  




 Yeah. Apparently that note is 40 percent of your purchase, so you're gonna wanna go ahead and make sure you get that. I know I personally can't even enjoy kratom if I don't have a short note to read while I'm taking it.  




 I don't know. Call Bill Nye. Keep slurping soggy kratom water if that's what you want to do.  




 Yeah but HS doesn't send you a hand written note like MS does. I've been told that's an important thing to look for in a vendor. 




 But HS costs half as much as MS does. You must be lying. 




 No. You didn't get nausea the second time because you took (less than) 4g. The 7g dose was too much for your first time.  




 So definitely mix it with some Green Bali or some shit then? I suppose I was figuring on maybe a g of RVS with 2 G of Bali along with the 2 G of RVT/GS. Not real sure why i ordered it. I coulda got an extra long BBQ burger at Burger King. Them things are outta control.

 Yeah it certainly doesn't seem like a good idea to use it daily, I guess I just had $7.50 burning a hole in my pocket. Lol. I look forward to giving it a shot though. 




 I do not experience this.... on a somewhat related note, does anybody else sneeze when they get horny? 




 I don't think "Long story short" means what you think it means. 




 In the snow. And we liked it. 




 You gotta wake up pretty early in the mother fuckin morning to get one past old TheMaddLib. 




 You crawled 10 blocks? Literally? 




 Everybody is different. I stopped for 10 days, about an 18 gram a day habit, and I only slept an hour a night for the first 7 days.... definitely not "slight insomnia" for me. Fuck that shit. Fuck it in its stupid asshole.  




 Alright I'm gonna have to give that a shot. I prefer mixing reds with greens so I would imagine it's the way to go. 




 IDK if I can stretch my pisshole wide enough to fit 2 grams up there. 




 Alright, so we all know extracts can fuck up your tolerance. I don't have much experience with extracts, I got some several years ago but I was shooting dope daily and therefore I never really felt it when I took it. Well, today I was on HS ordering some of my usual Green Bali and the Red Vein Thai/Gold Standard extract caught my eye, so I decided to order 2 grams of it. Does anybody have any experience with that product specifically from HS? How was it? My usual dose is around 5-6 grams, should I just take the whole 2 grams?  Is one dose of this extract going to fuck my tolerance up all that bad? Thanks in advance. 




 This never happened. I appreciate the effort you guys put into your site, though. 




 Dude. Those photos are pretty sweet. I like how they call one room a "drying facility", and all it's just a shelf with leaves hanging off of it and then the floor is just covered with them. lol. 




 Oh. I think my Ma did her thesis on it in college. 




 Thanks man. Interesting stuff. I like the idea of taking it as a daily potentiator. I've never really tried anything to potentiate other than grapefruit juice. I may give it a shot. Lowering tolerance a bit couldn't hurt either. 




 I read somewhere that a regular diet of tube steak helps your daily kratom doses just slide down your throat. 




 When I take too much and raise my tolerance, I just continue taking it at my same usual dose. The first and second day might not be as strong but it's always back to normal by the third day. I dunno if I'm just lucky in that aspect or what. 




 I would like to see those links please. Thanks. 




 Put it into a different container and just use a spoon to dip into it, rather than pouring it out. 




 Same here, drinking sucks. Kratom is wayyyy better. 




 You need to go to the hospital immediately.  




 Yeah that's pretty gangster.  




 Boy, I must be some sort of retard. I thought you meant send the kratom to a lab. I tried imagining your buddy sending a cooler full of urine specimens in with a sack of kratom tucked into it. Ha. 




 Yeah, like, he's gotta be a big shot, stretchin buttholes all throughout the land. 




 How much does it cost? I dunno the first thing about sending something into the lab like that. 




 Lol that's around my ceiling for the day, divided into three doses. I was being sorta sarcastic, I just thought it's funny Because it's not that much but sounds like a lot because you asked about milligrams instead of grams lol. There's a lot of people that take a lot more than that. 




 This guide sucks 




 I just wanted to let you know that I take 18000 milligrams a day. Don't act like you're not impressed. 




 It's the "The" part of the name that really does it for me. The Butthole Man. It's got a sick ring to it.  




 Yeah man they're fucked 




 "The Butthole Man" would be a great name for a porn star.
