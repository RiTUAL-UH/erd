 seriously what's the point in adding the solid gold jet? Why pay $10,000,000 for a jet when you can go and steal one from the airport and fly it around for FREE? 
Rockstar should only add NEW things and not rehashed exsisting stuff. 

That being said what stuff should be added in your opinion?  




 looks awesome! 



















 Everyone always asks who should play Bond next (I think Henry Cavill) but not too many people ask who the next villain should be. So that's what I'm asking.

I'm thinking Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor (he was rumored for Bond 24) and Idris Elba would be good ones. (Yes i would prefer Elba as a villain rather than Bond himself). 

Who are you guys thinking of?
