 i dont see anything wrong with this idea in principle, but i think it really depends strongly on what this guy wants/would want. If he WANTS a relationship but just doesnt want to take these steps, or doesnt have time or whatever, then it could be a really nice favour for him that he would appreciate. If not, he might not be too happy about it, right? Theres the risk of him feeling insulted or that you are overstepping your boundaries or soemthing like that.

i don tknow if this is something you'd want to ask him about first? like you can still take care of the whole thing for him just let him give you the okay first? OR if you definitely know that he would appreciate it without talking, then i dont see a problem with it and pleasantly surprising him with a few potential women who want to meet him. really, i think it all depends on this guys personal reaction to the idea. 




 i think a big difference between leaving a narcissist versus leaving a cancer victim is that a narcissist is generally capable to taking care of themselves ( even if they want you to believe they aren't); you are not leaving them to suffer and/or die, whereas by staying with them you are in fact suffering yourself. 

also, at a certain point (and i think this is true when you are trying to help anyone) you have to let your own self-preservation kick in. If something is causing more harm to you than help to them, sometimes you have to save yourself instead. You cant let someone drag you down and ruin your life simply out of guilt for leaving them. You wouldnt allow a drug addicted or abusive partner ruin your own happiness for the sake of theirs, ESPECIALLY (when it comes to narcissists) nothing you do seems to even make them happy. I feel the comparison is stronger between nFamily and abusive partners than between n's and those who are suffering from illness or injuries. 

There can always be some overlap; not every cancer patient has a heart of gold and sometimes sick people are abusive too, but in general i think the key difference is that you might hate caring for a cancer patient or invalid but you at least know you are helping them even if they dont appreciate it. but you are not helping or saving a narcissist by staying with them (and probably CANT help them anyway because its not that kind of illness i feel); you are only hurting yourself and letting them drag you down with them and ruining your own life for their sake. When you get to a point where you can realize that its either you or them, you have to choose you, because you are just as important as anyone else and deserve the chance to have a happy life just as much as anyone else.

edit: some words 




 i totally understand feeling regret over things from the past, even if it doesnt seem completely reasonable or worthy of regret. i usually refer to it as getting stuck in my head; stuck in a vicious cycle of bad memories, and it OFTEN happens when im trying to go to sleep. but it can happen anywhere and i think there is a way to force yourself out of that cycle, using willpower, and distracting yourself, and also learning to be fully HONEST with yourself about accepting the things you cant change, and cutting yourself some slack. anxiety makes it easy for you to be honest about your negative aspects, its a skill tht you CAN aquire to learn to be honest about your positive aspects, and to learn to be kind to yourself. 

when im in bed having a panic attack over shit from highschool or family or whenever the hell long ago i like to just try to CLEAR MY MIND and focus on thinking NOTHING. sometimes by mentally repeating a word like "clearrrrrrr" (like a personal 'ommm") or a phrase like "just keep swimming" over and over (this one is good if im walking somewhere cuz its a rhythm) and if i notice myself thinking anything other than that i force myself to go back to my repetition; like meditating, and i will do this anywhere i need to; rushing to work, on the subway, in crowds etc. sometimes you just need something to stop the train of negativity in your head. again, its not something that is necesarily easy you need to practice it like a skill but it DOES get easier. and it works no matter what kind of anxiety im feeling; regret about the past, fear of the future, social situations, whatever. the meditation-style response has become very helpful for me.

i believe in you, its going to be ok 3 




 i think its normal and i think she will grow out of it to a certain degree, although sometimes they stay pretty chatty. i would just talk to her back; when my cat starts getting chatty i have a convo with him until he gets tired of it. Also, make sure she nots trying to tell you something: dirty litter, out of food or water, toy is stuck somewhere, could be anything you never know but my cat has definitely done things like that and tried to communicate about something specific.

beyond that in terms of advice; maybe earplugs? just try to be understanding and kind and not take out your frustrations even tho its annoying its not her fault she doesnt know shes being a brat! you could call her a brat though, thats fine :) 









 Awesome!  




 ok thats pretty funny.
