 here's my guess - nothing 




 I agree. Could've easily put Hill William or collected works vol 1 on here, but didn't want my list completely dominated by him 




 Couldn't narrow it down to less than three. 

* *The Devil All the Time* by Donald Ray Pollock - southern, gritty, plain awesome

* *Crapalachia* by Scott Mcclanahan - incredible story telling about growing up in West Virginia. Funny and sentimental. Nothing else is like it

* *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball - dystopian novel with poetry like prose and touches of Kafka and David Lynch 




 I think the survey might have been skewed a little by giving the 5 most popular choices and a write in. I think people will just rather be lazy and opt to pick from their favorite of the five that they've read (often the only one they've read of the five, in some cases), rather than choose to write something in and throw away their vote, as the likelihood of a write in winning is slim.

I haven't read enough books published in 2014 to deem something "the best", but I liked

* *Silence Once Begun* by Jesse Ball
* *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer
* *Nobody is Ever Missing* by Catherine Lacy
* *Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel
* *The Absolution of Roberto Acestes Laing* by Nicholas Rombes
* *Half a King* by Joe Abercrombie 




 Sanderson, Stephen king, the martian, etc... popularity over quality 




 Typical reddit list 









 That's the joke

 I'm usually very against buying Early Access games, but not sure I can resist buying this next week. Is the EA more or less fully fleshed out? (Missing levels, bosses, etc?) Would I be better off waiting for an official release or buying into the hype now?

Also, any ideas on what pricing will be? 




 who cares, jodorowsky can do anything he wants to do in my eyes 




  And Terry Pratchett publishes a book every year, even still, and he's suffering from Alzheimer's. His books, if anything, are much higher quality.

Says you? I'll take ASOIAF anyday over Pratchett... 




 I'd rather him take his time than just pump out multiple works of questionable quality every year - like certain fantasy writers that will remain unnamed. 




 yeah, the gamergate comparison was both weird and insulting. 




 Where does the article mention a book being misogynistic because it had no men in it? Oh right, nowhere. 

Maybe they thought stuff like *Post Office* was misogynistic by the way Bukowski just casually describes how he rapes a woman on his route like it was no big deal? Or maybe you're right - fucking hypocritical feminist bitches! 




 Looks like someone didn't read the article, since that point of view wasn't expressed in the slightest. 









 People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles. 




 Flannery O'Connor 




 This interview kind of sucks but Ball is one of my favorite authors. Extremely excited for his new book. 









 Every other week. Inter library loan is the shit 




 Lol get some perspective there chief 









 What are a few of your all time favorite books?

What are a few of your favorite books released in the past couple of years? 


































 Flannery O'Connor

Carson mccullers

Margaret Atwood

Donna Tartt

Ursula leguin

Etc

 r/fantasy 









 200-250 pgs 




 One of my favorite books 




 The plotlessness/static characters are there, but it's a short read. I'm no DD expert but you still see a lot of his trademarks here - lots of weird quirky characters, lot of characters going off about philosophy, life, war, etc. It's an interesting novel where he compares football to nuclear war. Not his best but you probably won't regret reading it 




 It's basically showcasing what he would go on to do later - you can tell it's early work. That said, it was still pretty good, some great passages peppered throughout the book. 




 No 




 American psycho is great, a classic

Crash didn't do all that much for me, pretty boring. Lots of semen on steering wheels 




 *End Zone* by Don Delillo 




 I agree, but they are different. The movie is about Danny, and the book is about Jack 




 Cut down on tv and video games. You probably have plenty of time you could read, you just choose not to 




 Sometimes you just don't get a particular author, or it's the wrong time in your life to read a book.

As an aside Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut's most hyped (and still quite good) but not his best work, IMO 
























 I've played civ 4/5 and fallen enchantress :lh , so I'm mostly familiar with the concepts of this game. I wasn't sure how to go about cities/districts though. should i rush new cities? How many cities should I be aiming to build and how quickly? When should I build a district over a settler?

Thanks so much 














 I guess you don't like movies or TV much either then? 









 no it is not ok stop doing it immediately 









 hurrrrrr

 This book was great, highly recommend 



















 Elric 




 I enjoyed it. The writing is good and I felt it offered a somewhat unique take on the post-apocalyptic genre - probably the most positive, from the many I've read 




 "Help I haven't read a book since first grade" 














 Fantasy/YA is like junk food - pretty enjoyable and not something you want to completely cut out of your life, but you wouldn't want to solely subsist on it and it doesn't quite compare to fine dining 









 they're skippable past the first 



















 Cult classic is different than classic 




 Lol 




 Yes, agreed 




 I think taste is far less important than being open minded and adventurous with what you read 









 It doesn't take rating into account though (unless you specifically scroll to the "will i like this book" section and press the button) 




 get an ereader so you can instantly look up words. or read easier books 




 I loved *High Rise* 




 I read 70+ books last year with a 3 and a 1 year old. I'd read a lot more without kids, but finding time is still pretty easy. Bring a book with you to read in the 10 minute breaks in your day - getting there a little early to pick up kids from school, etc. Cut back on TV/video games. 
























 *Silence Once Begun*, like everything Jesse Ball writes, is excellent. Not my favorite of his, but still one of my favorite books released this year.

*Annihilation* is great, bound to be a weird fiction classic. The other two books of the trilogy were not the same quality in my opinion, but the first is a fine stand alone.

*Station Eleven* was an enjoyable read. Great prose mixed with storylines that feel human make it somewhat unique in the overused post apocalyptic genre.

Did not like *Dept. of Speculation*, despite garnering lots of praise.

 When you don't give a shit about any of the three games, you just pick anything so you can get a card. It isn't surprising 




 "unpopular opinion" 




 It's weekend warrior high rarity draft. First pick is guaranteed legendary and 2-5 are guaranteed heroics. 




 This is a great book. However if you are more than half way through and don't like it, why do you need us to tell you to stop reading it

 I do not like the "no politics allowed" rule. Some things relating to books are inherently politically charged, and are important things to discuss. I understand mods trying to keep things civil, but I can't get behind banning all talk of it outright. 




 god, who fucking cares 




 *Half the World* by Joe Abercrombie 




 what a douche 




 the goldfinch and elliot smith 




 It's incredibly obvious when someone times you out maliciously, and when someone needs to leave quickly. Unless all of these damn babies know when I have on-board lethal next turn... 



















 I am the only guy in my book club. I don't mind it. Part of the reason I joined a book club was to read things I wouldn't otherwise read. This has definitely been the case, and while I haven't liked everything, I've read quite a few good books in this way.

Sadly, I think book clubs are looked at as more of a female thing - unless they are specifically SF/Fantasy or geek themed, they are looked at as feminine.

Just shrug your shoulders and enjoy it. They are fun, and one of the few times I get to actually talk about books with others. 









 I guess you'll be picking me up this weekend to take the 45 minute drive into the city then? 




 I don't live in the city, so Barnes and Noble, yes. There is an indie bookstore near me, but it smells musty and awful, selection is pretty bare, and the pricing is very high. 




 Still going through Ballard's stuff, so far it's very hit or miss for me. I really enjoyed *High Rise* though 




 Bookstores are a pain in the ass to be honest. 50 percent of the floor space is taken up by e-readers, toys, board games, candles, cafes, etc. If I go in looking for anything remotely obscure, 9 times out of ten they won't have it, and I'm left wondering why I didn't just get the ebook, or get it from inter-library loan.
