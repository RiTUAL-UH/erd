 Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. I was introduced to the series with the nearly equally amazing Oblivion.

I went back and tried to play Morrowind a couple of times. I hate that game. I hate everything about it. I don't think there's a single aspect I experienced that wasn't done better in Oblivion and Skyrim.

But hey, some people like swinging a sword and having it miss the enemy right in front of them 7 times out of 10, and that's cool, it's not for me though. 




 A solid minute of people screaming. Wish I hadn't watched that. 




 Well, they asked a question. So the question mark is justified. And the answer to the question is likely to make a lot of people very excited, so I'd say the exclamation mark is also warranted. 




  you can't instill a conscience or a moral compass in a creature that wasn't born with one

WAT? You realise most rational people acknowledge that their "moral compass" is attained by reason and empathy right? Babies aren't born with the knowledge that killing someone is wrong, that's why children have to be taught right from wrong. 




 Well. I eat meat, but it's far from being purely for survival purposes. I could easily survive as a vegetarian, but I choose to eat delicious meat.

Should I face harsh punishment for this? 




 Is it really a sneak attack if everyone was expecting some Fallout news sometime this year? 




 This shit. This shit right here is literally the very reason I will NEVER give google or youtube my phone number, no matter how many times they ask and how much they claim it's for security. 




 I thought it was Christmas, Easter, and New Year. I guess the patriotic salute would suggest the 4th of July. 




 Freezing a snowman seems kind of redundant. 




 Jesus. Let this thing die already. 




 And it only took 10,000 attempts. 




 Can't you just turn the notifications off? I mean, seems like a standard feature. 




 You don't need a "decent team". Just buy three silver packs and use those cards until you can with the 3rd bracket. 




 Congrats. You got the button equivalent of entering a royal rumble last. 




 Great callback. I like your style. 




 Auditions to find a 4th member for Blue Man Group weren't going well. 




 Or the ones that don't seem to have any meaning. Unless I'm missing something there's one between Sub-Zero and Kung Lao that just, doesn't make much sense (I'm probably missing something).

Kung Lao: A dead man walks.

Sub-Zero: You will feel the chill of winter.

Kung Lao: You have met your demise.

WAT?

 




 Yeah, he's gay dude. 




 I like Sub-Zero's badass statement to Jason:

"Kombat me, fool!" 




 Boy is she barking up the wrong staff. 




 They didn't cripple Sub-Zero, I can now breathe again. 









 My friends drag raced their adder and entity and the entity won repeatedly. This is fully tuned with all the mods installed of course.  




 That may be the case, but it's still embarrassingly small for the task. The major releases on PS4 average at around 25GB, some are even 50GB! And they're mandatory installs.

Then on top of that there's updates, DLC, "free" indie games, shared pictures and videos. It all adds up.

I've had the PS4 for 2 years and I've had to delete stuff to make room for new games twice, that's appalling IMO. I never once reached the capacity of my Xbox 360 or my PS3 320GB HDDs. 




 It's my favourite car in the game. I love the way it looks, the way it sounds, and the way it drives. It's got enough grip to be able to control it, but enough slide so you can have fun with it. And although it's not quite as fast as say, a Zentorno or a Turismo it can hold it's own against those cars, and it's a fraction of the cost.

Love it. 




 Yup. I made a rare misspelling, and I really couldn't be bothered to correct it. Glad you sill knew what I meant.  




 My plan worked.  




 My mistake. I read it as unattractive. Now I see that word isn't in the title, and so my post makes no sense. Damn, got to be more careful in the future. 




 It sure is.

 An SSD? I'm not made of airports!

But your claim that the machine will take any HDD that's 7.5mm in height intrigues me and I wish to subscribe to your news letter. Since I've had to clear space on my 500GB HDD twice in the two years I've had the system I might have to look into this. 




 Were you 12 when you worked at Game? 




 OP's mum. 




 We saw this guy on the front page a couple of days ago. Except he was tea-bagging a Spartan. 




 this just makes it look less ugly.

Less ugly? Than what? A lepor? 




 How to make your pS4 look like it's got a hideous cyst in one easy step.

Seriously though, I always said the paltry 500gb HDD the PS4 shipped with was embarrassingly small, surely a ploy to get the sales of Sony's HDDs up. 




 It used to mean something. People used to want it because it shows great timing to wait for it to hit red and then get it.

But for the last couple of weeks it's been so fucking easy to get red it defeats the point. There's no challenge, no risk. Hence red is now the third most common flair.

I'm glad I got my orange flair because I had good timing, anyone with a red flair is just seen as someone who waited until it was impossible miss getting it. 




 Genius. 




 I agree with everything you just said, have for a long time. But my question remains. I guess that's the "Greater Good" response in a nutshell. In order for me to agree with you about the problem of evil I first must make the assumption that god follows the laws of logic. and I'm not sure if I can make that assumption. This is why I can't say for sure that he doesn't exist.


Edit: I've just done some reading over at Foxhole atheist regarding greater good theodicies and I have come to this conclusion. If the god of the bible is bound by the laws of logic (and until demonstrated otherwise we have to assume  that he is) then no, he cannot possibly exist.

I guess I'm an agnostic atheist or a gnostic atheist depending on the god in question. Thanks for the education ;)

Have an imaginary internet point that does not exist. 




 I guess.

Have a nice day, man. 




 Fair enough, assuming the god of the bible has the same morality most of us do, which it seems he doesn't.

Can we be sure that what we consider to be evil is the same as what god would consider evil? If god is the supposed author of morality could it be possible that if he does exist, we simply don't see that what he allows to happen is ultimately "good"? God's plan/mysterious ways etc etc.


I can't believe I'm actually arguing for the plausibility of the existence of god.

I feel dirty.



 




  That way I don't know if a God exists, that makes me an agnostic

An agnostic atheist, like me. Agnostic and atheist aren't mutually exclusive. You can have agnostic theists and gnostic atheists.

You don't know if an invisible fairy exists
You don't know if an invisible mammoth exists.
You don't know if an invisible whatever exists.
Should we have names like 'agnostic' for all of these ?

Nope, because the belief in any of those doesn't have real world consequences like believing in a god does. There are laws in various countries around the world that are religiously based, or religiously inspired.

I don't see any fairy laws dictating what people can and can't do. 

Nothing can break them.

People who believe in a god would beg to differ.

Believing in God is scientific ignorance

Of course it is, and yet billions of people still believe. 




 I guess we're talking about the god of the bible. You speak of negative claims and how they don't need to have any kind of backing up. What would you say to "There's isn't not a god"? Or what if someone said "The sun did not rise this morning"? I'd ask them to back up that negative claim.

It's reasonable to make a negative claim without evidence until there IS evidence for the positive claim

Is that not just absence of evidence though? We don't know he does exist, therefore he doesn't. 




 Yes it does. But claiming "God does not exist" as a fact is just as folly as saying "God exists", because you can't (currently) prove either one to be true. 




 There's a difference between not believing a claim, and proposing a counter claim.

I don't believe that there's an invisible fairy dancing on your back, but it's possible to feel your back and tell there's no fairy there. If you then say it's intangible and I have no way of detecting it, I can say I don't believe there's a fairy on your back, but I can't prove there isn't, and so I can't truthfully say that there is literally no dancing fairy on your back, because I can't possibly know that for sure because of the characteristics of the fairy in question i.e. it's undetectable.

The same goes for god. If you say "There is no god", the burden of proof is then on you to prove that your claim is true.

God breaks the laws of physics

How do you know for a fact that there exists no being in existence that can break the laws of physics? Can you prove no such being exists? If you can I'd love to hear it. If you can't, then you can't truthfully claim no such being exists.

and has zero evidence of him existing

[Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)

 




 Well. Someone made a claim, that claim is "God exists."

Have you been convinced that the claim is true? If not, you don't believe. If you've been presented with a claim, the fact that you don't give it any thought doesn't change the fact that you either believe it to be true, or don't believe it.

I agree that right now we can't prove either way whether a god exists or not, but the discussion is still worth having because religion is a large part of many countries, and often can have tangible effects on laws and people under those laws.

You don't have to disprove god to not believe he exists, you simply have to remain unconvinced of the statement's truth. Which I am. 




 OP didn't ask if you knew god existed or not, they asked if you believe.

Agnosticism/gnosticism address what you know (or claim to know).
Atheism/theism address what you believe. 




  That would be illogical.

How so? 




  It makes me wonder what kind of loving God would allow that.

Have you read the Bible? The stuff god supposedly allows is entirely abhorrent. I don't why anyone would want to worship a morally bankrupt fiend like that. 




 There is no God.

Unfortunately you just made a claim, can you back it up with evidence? Reasonably the best anyone can say is "I don't think there is a god." Outright saying "There is no good" places the burden of proof onto you, and if you can be sure there's no god then you must have some pretty compelling evidence.

I'm an atheist by the way. 




 I don't believe for a very simple reason.

Every single claim that a god exists that has ever been posited by anyone in all history has failed to meet it's [burden of proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof).

Every, single, one. 




 Apostrophes are simple, right?

Imagine a classical score but with an electronic flavour. Great soundtrack to a film that is at the very least a visual feast.

 Goro's not a mutant. But don't forget, Johnny can throw green fireballs and do shadow kicks, he's superhuman already. 




 Now that must have felt awesome.  




 How many times do I have to explain this? I'm not saying the video is shit. I'm not saying the video is boring, or unwanted, or lame, or anything like that.

All I am doing (read this next bit carefully because it's the most important part) is disputing OP's claim that this clip took a staggering amount of coordination.

How is this hard to understand? I liked the video. It's cool and amusing, no-one's disputing the quality of the video. I'm disputing the claim OP made as to how difficult this was to pull off.

Perhaps we have differing definitions of the word staggering. My point has been made as clearly as I can possibly make it. 




 The reason I stuck with the GM was because the unbreakable was utterly useless in jumping opponents, in the ice clone will freeze a jumping attack enemy, plus you can still move while its out.  




 I don't think you can. Unless there's a mod that allows you to make all NPC's give the finger.  




 I'm not in an organised crew, nor do I have any friends who still play the game. I also don't have the rockstar director so it would be hard for me to replicate it. This still doesn't mean it takes a staggering amount of coordination. Any half serious crew could manage it with minimal effort.  




 Very good video. Glad to see people uploading videos that actually teach us stuff instead of merely showing us.  




 I started by using the unbreakable variation because it looked the coolest, and no-one uses it. Some guy was watching my stream/coaching me and he said is benefit greatly from making the switch to GM variation. I've never looked back. 

Shame his only costume flair is that dull medallion. I miss the ice mask :( 




 Why not? If the shop is open its open. Obviously people who get in at the last minute and then take their time need a kick up the arse, but if they're quick and speedy I see no problem with it.  




 I'm not saying it isn't cool and amusing, it is. I'm just saying it likely didn't require a staggering amount of coordination.  




 Why does it look like is was taken in the 70's? 




 Not if they're friends/a crew. It would be incredibly easy. If it's randoms then yeah it would be tricky, but I have no doubt that these players are friends and/or part of the same crew, in which case it's not impressive in the least. 




 Genuine miracles.

lol. 




 Is it really stunning though? All they had to do was have one guy say: "OK guys. Let's all look left and give the middle finger for about 5 seconds."

Seems like it would have taken a very small amount of coordination to me. 




 It's a disaster movie... and you thought it was going to be good? 




 Seriously? I wait weeks for the challenge to appear and it's only here for a fucking day? I'm really struggling to think of reasons to keep playing at this point. So much bullshit going on all the time. 




 I just looked to see what I did to unlock him, apparently you get him for reaching rank 50 with a faction.

This is strange because I've reach rank 50 with 3 factions so far, and it took this long to unlock him? Weird.

Yes if paired with possessed kenshi

What makes the pairing so good?

Edit: Disregard. Just looked at Kenshi's passive. 









 It's simple. They're a cheating scumbag. 




 Question. How do you make such a smooth running gif? I've only ever used online gif makers and they suck. 




 It's like they're purposefully trying to bury the franchise. 




 Watch it in 240p for that extra 80's feel. 




 I can totally believe it. If "Yummy Mummy" is in the dictionary, anything can be. 




 Still, I just re-watched the trailer (hence the door smashing comment) and it seems pretty true to the gameplay of the final product. It's especially impressive given game trailers of recent years.

Wait, did I just imply that 2012 wasn't a recent year? whatever, you know what I mean ;) 




 I loved Dishonored. I've started Deus Ex HR 3 times now and never gotten past the first 30 minutes. It just doesn't grab me.

 KUNG FURY has been released for free on YouTube!

You say this like I'm supposed to know what this Kung Fury is.

Edit: Please, hold your downvotes. I've started watching Kung Fury and it's fucking amazing. How had I not heard of this until today? It's the most 80's thing I've seen, and I was born in 1985. 




 I approve of this comment.  




 True. But then what? I can't attack them while ducking a full screen away. 




 Did I make a mistake? Is this not laiden with puns? Where else would I post it but a thread titled /r/ fucking punny you cunt. 




 I don't. 




 Good advice. Thanks. 




 The Jacqui spamming machine gun move is hard to beat with out a teleport move, at least that's in my experience. 




  You know what they're going to do every single time, and you can beat it easily

As Sub Zero I always have trouble with Full Auto Jacqui machine gun spammers. Sure I can slide, but I need to make it perfect to avoid all the bullets, and that's hard. Sure I can use an EX slide, but then they go right back to spamming. The only way round this that I've found is to duck then quickly step forward and duck again, inching my way towards them. I guess it unnerves them into trying something else and then FFFFFWWOOOOOOOSSHSHHH! slide.

Edit: Downvoted for sharing my experience. Wow, this subreddit continues to display itself as the most hostile one I've been subbed to thus far. 




 How cute, they're small. 




 I don't look for reasons to be upset, the reasons find me. 




 Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet. When I'm sitting on the Lil Jon like a Big Boi you might mistake me for an Ol' Dirty Bastard, but fear not, that's just the Ice-T treating my bladder like a Flo-Rida, making me need to take a Wiz... Khalifa.

Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.

I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.

50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."

I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."

And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.

Iggy Azalea. 




  but you could've went in expecting a little more because of the amount of hype around it.

The same can be said about anything people praise. It's nearly impossible to hear everyone raving about something and not build up some expectations in your mind. 




 I've seen different bosses have different sized health bars. I'm assuming they have millions of HP and everyone has to fight as much as they can to collectively drain the health bar before the invasion is over.

That's how it seems to me. 




 He was a character on Noel Edmond's House Party. I'm assuming you're not from Britain, it was a pretty big Saturday (or Sunday) night show over here back in the 90's. Everyone loved it.

Sometimes Mr Blobby would show up and basically harass Noel, much to the audience's amusement. Looking back on it though, my parents must have fucking hated every second the pink freak was on TV, but us kids loved it.

Just watch this episode I just found and you'll see what we had to put up with on the weekend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leSGbxejtvw 




 Whenever I'm in a fast car and the cops are doing their keeping up bullshit I just look behind me, throw a sticky bomb out the window, and solve the problem. 




 Because I find the whole thing to be ridiculous. It's ludacris. 




 I know how you feel. I think the whole concept is ridiculous anyway.

"Look at how much money I have! Look at all the women I paid to be in my video! HUr durr!"

Seriously, who's impressed by the showing off rappers do? 




 I wholeheartedly and unabashedly LOL at everyone who was waiting expecting to be rewarded.

Should have pressed the button you fools. 




 But what about the hype of literally every person who's seen it? I've heard nothing but "It's the best action movie in years!" from everyone. 




 'twas all the rage when I was a kid. He hails from Crinkley Bottom. I'm not making this up.

 I'm willing to do something 99% of my console gaming brethren are too afraid to do.

Acknowledge that PC is objectively the superior gaming platform. 




 Don't let me go belly up! 




 They finally pulled their fingers out and released challenge mode? I might have to start playing again. Frankly I'm amazed at how quickly I got bored of this game considering I played Injustice almost every day for nearly two years. 




 I remember when this game first came out and everyone was equating the cops with Ed-209 from Robocop, on account of how dangerous they were compared to the cops in GTAIV.

Now we're all accustomed to their ways it's gotten pretty easy to make them look foolish/take them down without issue. Good job OP. You showed those fucks who owns the streets! 




 TIL welling up equates to breaking down, if OP is to be believed. 




 It's funny. When I initially started going for the trophy I thought it was insanely hard. It's cool to see so many different tactics being employed to achieve the same goal. 




 Sorry if this is old news or there's better known ways of landing hits on the invasion bosses. I just found a tactic that worked for me and wanted to share it with people who might be having trouble, like I was. 









 Yes. Everyone. James himself even said people say he looks like House.  




 People who can do this have my respect. I'm a pretty decent pilot in GTA, and I've never successfully flown upside down through a tunnel. 

And I've tried.  




 I've been told by several people that the price of building a PC in the UK is much higher than for US gamers. If I want to play games at 4K I'm looking at around 700, more than double a PS4's cost.  




 Oh yeah, that thing. Thanks for clarifying.  




 What? 




 Not everyone wants/likes/can afford to play in PC. It's all well and good claiming PC gaming is cheaper in the long run but there's still the hurdle of the steep entry fee. 

But I guess this all moo because we'll never know.  




 What is this? r/nocontext 




 It's fine. You just have to be careful. You can turn on the spot if you're careful. 




 The game's been out for nearly 2 years and you learned this today? 




  If we eliminated that, we would have the same amount of gamers with better systems

Or you would have fewer gamers. You can't possibly state one way or the other. 




 I may be late, but 141 people enjoyed the post. And I never said Kotal wasn't a better character, I enjoy listening to him talk.

 You'll forgive me if I haven't thought about Ogre for many years and so he wasn't at the forfront of my memory. 




 I find that sort of thing seems to be pretty frowned upon in /r/mortalkombat 

A lot of people seem really hostile in this subreddit, at least in my experience. 




 I understand. Outworld law states that the offending party be subjected to hanging their head in shame for no less than 15 seconds. 

**hangs head in shame** 




 I though he was a sun/blood God.  




 I wouldn't be surprised if they were both based on than.  




 Thanks! Stan Lee once said every comic is somebody's first time reading one. I think the same can be said for most posts to reddit. 




 He's "The God of Fighting". He's pretty powerful. 




 I get that many people do. I was just saying that I don't. I know nothing about Dota 2, that's probably why I didn't recognise him. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Just noticed the spelling mistake in the title. Sorry guys. 




 I have no idea who that is. 




 But that isn't even Ogre's final form! 




 Well it's the first time I've seen it posted to reddit. Sorry for lacking the ability to see every post made to the MK subreddit. 




 Takeda isn't exactly my main. And I dropped a few combos here I shouldn't have, but it's still pretty tricky to go two rounds without being hit at all, even blocking.

Sorry I'm not MLG like yourself. 









 Are these comics canon with the games? 









 Nice. Loving the Noob rep also. 




 I just spotted the time played. I'm pretty sure I've played more than 2 horus and 50 minutes lol. Unless that's 2 days and 50 hours. 




 Yeah. I once went to bed and woke up with a higher rank, that's why I'm not sure how accurate the rank is. 









 Username checks out. 




 Of course. I keep forgetting games on PC are much cheaper. 




 Good to know, thanks. 




 Don't worry. You won't be seeing that kind of post from me again lol. 




 Yeah sorry for my snarky reply earlier. A little understandable given your comment but my attitude wasn't necessary. I had a quick scan of your past comments to see if you're a dick but it looks like you're a decent guy, that's why I feel bad for being an ass to you earlier. 




 Cool. Thanks for clarifying. 




 Ok. Sorry to be dragging down the community by asking a question. I'll be sure to delete this post so I avoid making this subreddit go to shit any more than it supposedly has.

Note to self. Don't ever ask the Reddit MK community a question ever again. They apparently hate that shit. 




 Telling me to block everything the enemy throws at me is much easier than actually blocking everything. 




 Thanks for the tips. I main Sub-Zero so I usually slide in after the minion instead of running.

Also, fuzzy block? 




 No. I understand the benefit of knowing one's enemy. I'm just saying that if I'm going to learn a character I might as well use them. 




 If all they do is teleport then yeah, easy. The people I fight do much more than teleport. 




 And you clearly haven't read the comments. If you had you'd have seen that this issue has been remedied. I should probably delete this post then shouldn't I? 




 I do use the blocking mechanic. But there's this other mechanic called mix-ups. They kinda make it hard to block sometimes. And once you're hit, that's it, 34% of your life bar, gone, because a little tap to the foot opened you up. 




 There's no way I'd put the time and effort into learning a character and then just not use them. 




 Yeah man. I rarely lol when I'm alone. It's usually just the huff of air out the nostrils.

But I lol'd twice during this and thought, that's redditworthy. 









 Thanks. That mouse looks awesome. Lights for some reason! 




 Just thought of a question. I looked at a review video for the monitor and it seems a little, small. I'm used to gaming on a TV that I think is pushing the 48 inch range. I could always buy a bigger monitor later, but is hooking the PC up to my TV a viable option? People always tell me it's a thing you can do but when I hook my laptop up to the TV the picture quality seems to drop. 




 Thanks for the info. I read that I don't want a weak CPU because it can slow down the GPU, is this much of an issue?

Also I keep hearing the term benchmark but don't know what that is in terms of computing.  




 Yeah I suppose if I learned his moves of be better equipped to fight him. I've just been avoiding learning him because everyone uses him and I don't want to add to that. And if I know him I have to use him, that's the law.  




 Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe. 




 Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe. 




 Oh yeah. I always forget about the online fees since I've been paying them for so long. 




 Ah yes. I see the rule you mean now. This is how much of a noob I am. I assumed /r/buildapcforme was where people would literally build a pc to the specs you ask for, and /r/buildapc was where people suggested builds for you. Now I know. 




 Here's the new post for you to follow if you wish.

 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I want to play games that look better than on my PS4 (Witcher 3, GTAV, that sort of thing). Ultra settings would be nice but I have no idea how expensive that is, so high would suffice if the cost is over my budget. I'd also like to do some light video editing and rendering using Sony Vegas.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I don't know when I'll be buying. I'm looking to get an idea of what I'll be buying since I know nothing about the innards of PCs.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

This will be from scratch so I guess I'd need a tower, OS, one monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. Not sure what else I'd need.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

England.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

None.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I have no idea. I guess so. I thought everyone overclocked gaming PCs.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

"RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL" I don't know what any of that is. I'd like an SSD but they're mega expensive. I'd need at least 2TB of storage for all the games I reckon.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Not yet. Just trying to get an idea of what I need. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I guess I'll need windows. I've got 8.1 on my laptop but I much preferred 7, that metro stuff is just annoying. Is there a benefit to using older versions?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I am a noob. Please remember this when saying things like "Radeon 9500 GTX" and "i7 quad core". 




 The second rule I see is:

No facilitating piracy, linking to pirated software or tools to pirate software

I guess there's more than 1 set of rules? But yeah, I'm going to post this over at /r/buildapcforme as suggested by another redditor. 
 




 I'm going to post it in /r/buildapcforme because someone suggested it would be better off there. I'll give you the link once I've posted it. 




 Cool. Thanks for letting me know. I'll post it there. 




 Let's assume the PC version ran just as well as the console versions. What would be the advantage of getting the PC version? I know the advantage to PC versions of most games (better graphics, higher framerate, mods etc) but since MKX looks great on consoles and runs at 60fps, what's the advantage to the PC version? 




 That's strange. I never say things like Dat Ass because I think it's dumb. But I see so many top comments saying dat ass I figured it was something people enjoyed reading. But of course. I made the mistake of thinking reddit makes sense, so when I say it, downvotes, when other people say it, upvotes.

Fuck reddit sometimes.  




 Cool. Me too.  




 Which Soul Calibur game was Kratos in? I only know of:

Soul Calibur 2: Xbox = Spawn
PS2 = Heihachi
Gamecube = Link

and Soul Calibur 4.

PS3 = Darth Vader
Xbox 360 = Yoda

and Soul Calibur V

All versions = Ezio. 




  I just play wired for a bit.

Nothing like a bit of retro gaming lol. 




 Yeah, sorry for my dickish comment. I've become everything I used to hate about reddit lol. 




 That's terrible. 




 When you put it like that, it does seem kind of oxymoronic. I was just angry when I started the post and chilled out near the end. 




 Fair enough. 




 Yup. She became a gamer around the time she bought an Xbox 360 in 2010 ish. She keeps surprising me. She owns a Five Finger Death Punch Album... she's 55. She loves playing games like Skyrim, Fallout, and most recently, X-Com Enemy Unknown and she just finished Deus Ex Human Revolution.

It's cool. 




 Noice! 




 I'm sure the Xbox One controllers do have a great life span. I know the Xbox 360 did, but then again the tradeoff was that you had to buy batteries and keep swapping them out when they need charging. With my PS4  I have a dock that holds two controllers. When one gets low on power I simply turn it off, place it down, pick up the other one and keep playing. I will agree that the battery life on the PS4 controllers is embarrassingly short, but 4 hours is doing it a disservice. 




 It's almost as if the stuff bundled with collector's editions of games is cheap tat!

I remember when my Mum opened her collector's edition of Elder Scrolls Online and pulled out the statue of Molag Bal. A statue we'd assumed would have been made from metal given the price of the fucking package.

NOPE.

It was cheap as fuck plastic. I've heard the same from people with other collector's editions. This is why I don't buy collector's editions. Mostly because I don't want the shit that comes with them, I just want the game, but partly because I've been nothing but underwhelmed with what I've seen so far.

Did anyone get the collector's edition of Black Ops with the RC-XD? Or the CE of Modern Warfare 2 with the night vision goggles? what was the build quality like on those? Also the Scorpion statue with MKX.
