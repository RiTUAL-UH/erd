 Nope. Full of hackers, scammers and dicks.

 Not much, all that is left is a small engraving on the paving outside. EA has done it's best to cover it up.

 Yes, please email your bank infomation to 2C4AMS@EA.CO.UK 




 Pretty bad, tbh.
 




 Oh, yeah that, we were under-trained. Most training meetings were canned. 




 Evil. 




 Because all we did was joke around all day in the offices, doing bullshit until we got an actual call, we were all tired due to not getting much sleep. ._. 




 can I put my HDMI cable into your port? ;) 




 XD I know I got it and i can only just run it in low at the lowest resolution. So unoptimized! 




 Specs:
AMD A10 7700K APU
R7 Radeon (APU)
8GB Ram

If so what FPS? And if it's going to be 30 or below, any modifications i can do to make the game run at 60 or a better framerate? 




 My friend does, his name is Manakin 




 I just made a server and port forwarded it's really easy. 




 I don't know why, this game fills me with nostalga from my childhood. 




 :( i'm really sad now. I REALLY want to play with my friend. But he does not have the money to buy it. *sigh* If any PCMR member would to buy it for him, i'll be FUCKING GRATEFUL as fuck. I'll give you the $20 in my wallet, just give me your steam name and a game under or $20 and it's yours. 




 I don't know. It makes me really sad, because I was looking forward to playing with my friends, I don't want a shark card! I only want to buy the game.
