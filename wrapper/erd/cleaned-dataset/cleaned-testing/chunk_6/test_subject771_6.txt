 5 magical words:  "Get off of my land".  Reach for your belt.  They'll leave. 














 They can't recognise "if I say the wrong thing, she's going to pull over, and I'm going to get beat, and have to blame my bloody nose on "I wasn't wearing a seatbelt and a deer jumped out, so my GF stopped rapidly, and I smashed against the window" is abusive?  What the fuck?  And just a look will send you into shaking and trembling and cowering in the corner of the cab at 60 MPH to get away from her if she decides to hit you?  And she does the "mom count to 3" Really?  Then she thinks you were prank calling her the night before, so she beats you almost senseless when you're crying and begging her to stop, and your man cousin pulls her off because you're getting your ass kicked, and crying?  You can't recognize that as abusive?  What the hell is wrong with you?

**EDIT:** Yes, I know, /r/oddlyspecific  It got bad enough, that in my Senior year, I always had a tape recorder and video recorder on me.  That was more effective than the knive I've carried since age 10.  She did catch me a couple of times without my backpack though.  Those days weren't good. :( 




 That seems like as good of an explanation of any, but I still don't get it.  Why not "FTW", and just stay out of relationships because "you know" it's going to end bad, so why bother even trying? 




 Pretty much.  Or people who are oddly attracted to people who remind them of HS bullies, and want to get in thier pants.  I don't get it.  Let's see, "I used to be beat as a kid, so I want to re-enact it as an adult"  What?  Why?

 What's it say for if you put up an aerial? 




 By that logic, I could have "faith" in The Enterprise Project, and believe that NASA is really suppressing evidence of ancient martian civilisations.  Yes, there's more evidence for that than of any god. 




 Why believe in what you have no direct and reproducible evidence for though?  I "believe" in what can be tested and confirmed.  My stance on God is about that as Glesie 581D having sapient species, (or any species of life at all).  Could there be?  Sure.  But sine we can't observe, monitor, or test for it, and it has no affect on anything, it's a mute point whether god or aliens exist.  The undetectable is indistinguishable from the non-existent. 




 Then what created god?  If you say "god always existed", then why can't that exact same argument apply to the universe its self?  As far as "where you go when you die", Most people get entombed in the Earth, others are cremated, and others are left to rot in the woods.  "you" go nowhere.  You simply stop existing.   




 The Mohu Leaf didn't do shit for me, but a cheapo RCA antenna gets me 6 channels.  Have you looked up your TV Fool report?

 Or, you know, resurrect 1953.  Put up a fucking antenna.  If you want go go back to the radio, 1927.  This is the Citizen's Broadcast system:  We keep an eye on America.  CBS was the first to color TV in 1953, and lost out to RCA, (NBC).  Fuck National Broadcast Company!

[I smoke Two Joints.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsv4Lb7EQs) 




 Nope, I smoke dope maybe once a year.  MJ has basically nothing to do with anything.  The longest I've spent high is a week back in 2005.  I wass **VERY** baked then.  I decided to stop because I was just too damned high.  I "took a break" lasting over 4 years because "I can't do this anymore".  I was so damned high, that I just had to stop because I couldn't know what was real or not, so I put the bong down, and "back to life, back to realty" was the hit song that 5 days of sobering up.

 




 Do you like it when your daddy touches you, and says "it's god's will"? 




 Ask my SIL about how much I blab when I'm high.  The last time I smoked dope, I was blabbing away for 8 hours, and wouldn't shut up.  I got hit twice because I wouldn't shut the hell up.  I can't even recall what the hell I was talking about, but I woke up with a sore head, and an inflamed cheek because I wouldn't shut the fuck up. 




 There's a difference between the Catholics and the Pentecostals/Mormoms/Baptists.  Catholics, you have to go to, Mormons they seek you out like they are on a mission.  I guess that's why the call them missionaries, 




 You mean like the modern Catholics?  Well, if you want to see what they're about, go to church and ask the Father questions.  He'll be more than happy to talk to you if you want.  I don't like Mormons, the Baptists, and Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses because of the active indoctrination involved.  But if you go seek out the knowledge yourself out of curiosity, (or whatever), then more power to you.  You walked in there, you are free to walk away. 




 Try and sell a sober 30 year old man on religion.  Whether it's Mormonism, or Zoroastrianism will make no difference.  The man will spot it for the bullshit that it is, and might fuck with the 19 year old kids trying to sell the religion for a while, but eventually, he's going to tell them to fuck off and get of of his land. 




 For the same reason you're so gullible. 




 Religion/faith = Belief in something without any evidence to prove it.  Whether it's fung shui, or Christianity, or "healing crystals", matter not. 




 I respect the Mafia and the Hell's Angels because of "influence", and I can prove that they exist.  A simple call on my telephone will prove it.  They exist, and sell drugs, guns, and ride motorbikes.  They also kill people, but if you don't fuck with them, the most you'll see them is driving down the road and lie to your wife "I guess there's a harley convention in town" while you know exactly while there's so many motorbikes on the road.

Also, Hitler was FAR from conquering the world.  HE fucked up by having a 3 front fight, and allying with Japan.  Getting attacked by England, USSR, USA, France, never goes well for you. 




 But if everything is "god's will", how can humans have free will?  Similarly, if humans have free will, how can anything be "god's plan"? 




 Yeah!  Bronze age goat herders who lived in caves and huts have all the answers to life!  What's your shirt made out of BTW?  Can I see your bat that is a bird? 




 History shows that "conversion at the point of a sword" is the most effective.  Look at the Christianization of Europe 1200 years ago, or Islam today.  "Convert or die" is very effective. 




 N/P, the instant they shut up about their god(s), and stop blabbing how I'm going to hell because I am a human and am using the brain that "god gave me". 




 Yeah, an "all seeing, all knowing and all caring" being made Adam an Eve, and forbid humans to eat of the tree of knowledge.  That flies about as well as a Led Zepplin.  Oh wait, worse.  That was actually a very successful band.  Tell me again why God allowed 9/11 to happen?
 




 Not always [Yes, there are atheists in foxholes](http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/). 




 Sure you can.  Old code.  "Don't look for shit and fuck with people, but defend yourself".  Easy. 




 There is no such thing as a "democrat child", or a "republican child".  Why are there "muslim children", and "Christian children", and "Catholic Children?  If you can't back up your claim with evidence, your ideas deserve no respect.
 




 I'll shut up about atheism, the instant that the religious shut up about their god. 



















 Hey, gotta recruit and train!  The NFL drafts just happened. 




 You mean "recruits people", so they give them more money, and provide no tangible benefit in return? 




 Would you respect the idea that all the space jews stole the Moon money, and that's why the Lunar race had to sell off it's atmosphere?  Of course not.  No evidence for that ridiculous claim.  Religion is no different.  Why can't you respect my "belief" that the space jews did steal all the moon money? 




 They were likely indoctrinated as children.

 Only when I smoke dope, then I can't stop talking. :) 




 There's a difference between offering a service that can be used as needed, (hey you know where they are), for people in genuine need of such services; versus selling "You're a horrible person, and deserve to not only die in a fire, but burn for all of eternity. but if you accept insert god or godhead here, you get to go to heaven after you die!  Yeah your life sucks, but the afterlife will be so much better!"

**EDIT:**  "Addiction counseling" is a sham designed to get people into the religion of AA.  Instead of 12 steps, (only which the first one has anything to do with insert drug, there should be two steps.  

* Step 1:  "Stop doing drugs".  
* Step 2:  See step 1.

 I've only done it with text on IM, and intro'ed songs to people on FB. I know how to introduce a song, and start up a playlist, but I think I sound strange even on a PA system at walmart. (where I used to work). I have no idea how I sound recorded, it's been over 25 years since I've taped myself. (I was a kid with a tape recorder).

I've DXed for about half of my life, and can build AM and FM reception antennas with no problems.  I used to use a CB in the grain truck when I was growing up, (and a couple of times after I became an adult to report emergencies using channels 3 and 9)  Other than that, I have no experience on the air.  All I know about it is "don't cuss, and ID yourself every 15 minutes of broadcast, and you can't play music on CB frequencies".

I don't think terrestrial radio is ever going to die.  Sat radio is about $10/mo, and not worth it IMHO. AM/FM is free, and you might have a lot of crappy stations, but you do get a couple of good ones that are worth listening to.

I want to work for a classic rock station.  I don't think I would do too well in a pop music station.  "and here's some more teeny-bopper crap for the 11 year olds".  Yeah, I don't think that would fly too well.  Give me Led Zeppelin, Twisted Sister, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and Iron Maiden. Hell, throw in some AC/DC and Metallica for good measure. :)  I would rock their socks off. :)

I know I couldn't be the AM Radio KQQQ morning news guy, (I can't talk that long), but on 100.5FM, I could do it, (but I would have to watch my mouth so I don't get fined by the FCC).

But to answer your question:  Never.  It's private property.  Either buy it, or fuck off.

 To take a piss while taking a shit.

 The issue I have, is what the hell do I tie off to?  There's nothing up there to tie off on, and I'm a single man, so I can't exactly bailey myself.  I don't really feel like falling 40 feet to my death. 




 Well, got the compass.  Now I just have to figure out how to get up there.  Is paracord strong enough to keep me from falling to my death if I slip?  I know it's 550# test, but F=MA.  From my math, I could fall half a meter before the cord snaps, (with no air resistance).  I know the TV of a human is around 192 km/h (with air resistance, or there would be no TV).  Here's a picture of the front of my house:

http://i.imgur.com/TPQEY8d.png 




 Well, I just got permission from my LL to install an antenna on the roof if I want.  Now I just have to figure out how the hell to get up there.  I called walmart, they won't rent out the manlift that they have.  Sun Rental will, but it's 100 per day.  A 35 foot ladder is $60/day.  But for that price, I could just buy one.

How safe would it be to get up on the roof without a ladder, by just going out the window, and tying off with paracord?  Speaking of which, I need to go buy a compass, so I have degree measurements. 




 It makes no difference whether 1 person has 99 dollars, and the rest have 1 between them.  GDP is GDP.  And yes, I know what GDP is.  Gross Domestic Product.  The sum total of the economy.  Who cares if the other 99 people are worse off?  If they want more of that money, they should get a job from the dude who has the money.  Like the saying goes.  "He who has the gold, makes the rules".

And no, I didn't get it from Faux News, (I don't even know what channel it's on), or Limbaugh.  I stopped listening to that blowhard back in 2005.  I got that conclusion from the OWS crowd where they want to "eat the rich", and "spread the wealth around".  They're complaining about being poor, but they have iPhones, and Macbook Airs.  Yeah, "poor".  My white ass.  If they're poor and can afford that shit, (more likely their parents bought it for them), then the Pope is middle-class.  The OWS crowd should be forcibly removed for the squatters and vagrants that they are.  Fortunately, I live in a city where we still enforce the vagrancy laws. 




 Yeah, a rocket mount.  The track would just slow it down.  But what if somebody fit a rocket car with super slick skis?  Would that even work?  And if so, what would stop them from taking off like an aeroplane? 




 Here's my [TV Fool](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3d82301db3f4775e).  I actually can pick up K40EE and KLEW. 




 Here you go:  Direct from MS; [build 10130](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso). 




 Well, that explains why I can sometimes DX radio stations as far away as Nebraska, and picking up KGO at night isn't exactly hard.  Hell, I can pick it up with my walkman, and no large ferrite antenna. 














 A) Money is money.  "equal distribution" makes no sense.  Why should a walmart greeter make as much as a doctor?  Are you that daft?  Fuck.  Cripples and idiots can be a walmart greeter.

B)  Yes, American politics are fucking dumb.  No argument there.  We have a 2 party system.  Like it or not, reality is what it is.  No amount of dreaming, or jerking off in your bed at night to fantasize about the Constitution or Green party will make any difference. 




 Have you tried upgrading from an ISO?  On my desktop, I'm on build 10135. 




 I've wondered this too. Back in the 90's when I only had antenna service, I actually hoped for shitty weather because that was the only time I could pick up Fox. I missed the finale of ST:V because we had good weather that day. I was pissed off for 2 weeks.

Anyhow, from what I remember from TV DX magazine, bad weather is often accompanied by low atmospheric pressure and low(er) surface temperatures. This allows the TV signal to bounce off of the ionosphere, and come to your antenna. 

To test this hypothesis, you could go out with your garden hose and spray your antenna. Try it both at night, and during the day at the height of heat. That will see if water has anything to do with your reception. 




 Yep. That's right. I actually have that entire series stored on my computer.  Hell, I have enough media that I could run a TV station if I had a transmission tower. (And if I could legally set up an NTSC broadcast). 




 The 100 people having 100 dollars are exactly as rich as the 10 people having 100 dollars. Wealth isn't increased or decreased because of how many people that have it.

 Having a job. Both hand and blow. 




 Quantum Leap. 









 I could have, but when I lived 16 miles from the nearest town with over a thousand people, and 4.6 miles outside of a town with only 120 people, (and have to go to school on a bus trip taking over an hour), it's kind of impossible.  

You have work to do on the ranch, and have no time to "blow" before school.  After school, you feed the animals, so cleanup around the ranch, and watch TV.  I could have if I wanted, but I honestly had no time for trivial pursuits in social engagement.

How has it affected me?  Well, I finally got really high and got laid at 27 years old.  I got her pregnant so we got married.  We had a son.  2 years later in 2012, she wanted another kid.  I fucked her without a condom and got her pregnant.  Wife left, kids lost.  Reality sucks.  I'm never dating again, and I'm 32 years old.  It's simply not worth my time to ever try dating again. 




 Can you imagine it launched today?  What would Sam Beckett do on 9/11, or 7/7?  How would he have handled the massive power out in NE during 2003?  How about the killing of Princess Diana in 97?  The fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union?  The OKC bombing?  The Y2K transition, when that was the last time humans weren't in space at all?  Don't forget about Iran Contra, and the Panamanian conflict.  Iraq because of oil, 10 years later, back to Iraq.  Color TV, and NTSC transition.  Antennas die, and resurrected again.  People getting off of cable, and putting up aerials and watching videos online.  14.4Kbps, 33.6Kbps, 56K, BROADBAND!  C-band satellite, Ku-satellite, Wild feeds, DBS, Cable, back to antenna again!  Planes wrecked, monuments destroyed, war again. "Depends on that the meaning of "is" is".  Entitlists, unemployment, economy died, economy "revived".  Housing collapse, market rebuilding, economy is still stagnant.  We didn't start the fire! It was always burning, Since the world's been turning. We didn't start the fire. No we didn't light it, But we tried to fight it!

OK, before I become Billy Joel and start writing Lyrics for "We Didn't Start the Fire, (2015)", I'll stop now. :D 




 A 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe.  It cost all of $100, and was a POS, but it was **MY** POS.  As far as recommendations?  Something large.  More mass will protect you.  Look at 70's impalas, and Lincoln Town Cars.

 The only advice I have is if you move to a location where you cannot receive service (clear view of the southern sky), then they'll let you out without any consequences.  Much like how to get out of a cellphone contract.  Or, wait until they send you a "user member agreement" update, and disagree with a clause.  You have 30 days to bail without any consequences.

**TL;DR:**  Move to where you can't get service; or review the revised member agreement when you get one in the mail, and find something to disagree with. 




 Fuck per capita.  GDP is what matters.  "Everybody is Equal" in the congo, where they have to burn buffalo and Elephant dung to cook their food.  Equality isn't a virtue, it's a pox on the development of a modern society.  Liberals want to make "everybody equal" by bringing everyone down to the lowest common denominator, instead of raising up the poor to be comfortable.  "be successful, but not too much", should be the democratic party's slogan.  At least then they would be honest. 




 I have no problem with infrastructure maintenance and improvements.  We have to keep the lights on, the water flowing, trash service running, and the roads passable.  Funding of education is also needed, as an educated populace is crucial to maintaining a free society.  

Lack of education leads to Somalia and Afghanistan.  I have no problems with spending money on education, but quite a lot of that money is wasted on overhead and union dues, and paying lawyers.  It should be going to the children's direct benefit, not the NEA and SEIU. 




 "going to shit"  Yeah, that's why we have the highest GDP on the entire planet. Even the Chinese can't hold a candle to us. 




 Why should I care about people who I will never see, or hear from beyond commercials on TV begging for money, or on the news about the earthquake about destroyed buildings and impassable roads?  It doesn't affect me, so it's not my concern. 




 You're the one that thinks you're liberal utopia doesn't allow cousin marriages.  Here's news to you:  They do.  In NJ, incest has actually been decriminalized between consenting adults. 




 How do I mount the pole to the roof?  Back in the 90's, I just turned my room into a giant antenna, and that worked fine.  But I'm not sure that will even work with the new ATSC standard.  I've never really set up a rooftop aerial before. 




 All children are bums.  They contribute nothing to the economy, and are economic drains on society. 




 I don't give a shit about other people.  I'm not them, and I won't ever meet them.  Why should I care about starving kids in Nepal, and wrecked houses?  I'm not there.  It doesn't affect me, (and never will). 




 Oh, and the "progressive" states, are where cousin marriage is legal.  You can marry your first cousin in NY, MA, NJ, MD, CO, and CA. (and other states)

 I rock out, watch TV, smoke pot, and drink beer in my off time.  It's cheap entertainment.

 Have fun being "worldly", and crying over TV commercials about starving kids in Nepal saying "so sad", but not doing a damned thing to change it. 




 I actually grew up upper-middle income.  My father was making upwards of $75000 a year in the 90's.  I make less than $20,000 a year, and honestly doubt I'll make anywhere close to what my father made, (let alone adjusted for inflation).  Dreams and fantasies are useless.  They are like masturbation.  They make you feel good, but accomplish nothing. 




 Yeah, a real world where people want their obama phones.  If you can't afford a phone (really?  for $8/mo, you can get 250m a month with unlimited texting), maybe you shouldn't have one.  Use payphones, or get a landline.  Cellular phones are a luxury, and not needed. 




 No shit.  I was 8 at the time.  It was funded by my parents. 




 Of course the national leaders (and the uber rich), get a higher standard of care than joe blow off of the street.  They have the money to afford it, so they can buy it.  Just like in a car, you can buy the $0.50 sparkplugs, and no-name oil, or you can buy the $7 (each spark plugs coated in platinum, with "triple fire technology", and synthetic oil.  With more money, comes more choice in what you can afford.  

Should everybody be forced to drive a 18 year old truck that leaks coolant, just because I do?  Or should I be able to get a Jaguar becaus some rich people buy them?  Of course not.  There is a different vehicle and different levels of services for people of different income levels.  Healthcare isn't much different.

I did watch the video, and he stated his points well.  However, he neglected the one reason that US healthcare is more expensive.  Namely, R D costs, and the patent system.  In countries such as the UK or Australia, the government holds the exclusive patent rights to the medications and medical technology, and it is shared immediately.  In the USA, there is a 7 year patent, and generics are prohibited during that time.

If it was a work related activity, that meets the requirements in WA to qualify as "work search".  However, when you are unemployed, there is no such thing as "vacation days".  Sure, you can sit on your ass on the weekend, but you are expected to make an active search for work.  When I was a maintenance man, I had vacation time, but never used it.  I had over 168 hours of banked up vacation time that I refused to use.  Upon separation of employment, I got a "free" month of pay in addition to unemployment.  I don't believe in taking vacations.

And if I was a "captain of industry" like you seem to like that term, I would be smoking Cuban cigars on my yacht, and have a runabout in my yacht so I could make it to shore.  My "runabout" would be a 32 foot boat, and I would have a skip on that if I wanted to go into an area where there are no docks.  That would be a "captain of industry".

We actually have no "trade" schools within 31 miles.  The one 50 miles away, (WWCC), churns out nurses, and CNA's and tech support people.  Nothing else is offered.  I could cross state lines and pay $8000/semester, but incurring $32,000 of debt just to get a $30,000 job still is a wash at best.  There is no point to getting a degree that doesn't pay off in a maximum of 2 years, (and be debt free).  

he strange thing is, the one school, (LCSC), that I could attend a trade school to be a diesel technician, or a welder, or a plumber, (or whatever), is actually closer to me (28 miles), than the nearest in-state  trade school.  After that, it's a 78 mile one way trip to SFCC.  Can you tell I live basically in the middle of nowhere?

Trade schools do have their place, as they teach practical skills that generate income.  However, the "general studies", or "Major in philosophy, minor in Arabic" degrees are completely useless.  Being "well rounded" doesn't matter for shit if you get several tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and work at starbucks or drive a taxi.  That was just a waste of money.  They would have been economically better off if they had just never went to school in the first place.

 I was born in 1983.  I remember that conflict.  We crushed them within 3 weeks, they torched the oil wells, and fled back into Iraq.  We stopped half way to Baghdad, because GHWB pulled out.  That was pointless.  We should have just crushed Soddomy Insane back in 91. 




 In Europe, there is a benefit to being multi-lingual.  But in the USA, there's really no point.  There aren't many mexicans in Whitman County, and the Chinese people mostly keep to themselves.  English is the primary language of the USA, and there really is no need to know any other language beyond English. 




 That was in the 80's.  I was thinking more along the lines of the bombing of 10 downing street in 1991.  Such a peaceful country, the UK.  Oh, don't forget about the Protestant/Catholic conflicts. 




 "Worst performing"  Yeah, right.  DPRK and Cuba beg to differ.  Where do all the world leaders come to get advanced medical care?  Oh, that's right.  The USA.  They don't go to France or Indonesia.

Also, I did it exactly once because I needed food.  I hardly made a living at it.  And one hour for $50 of food is almost like I got paid to sit through the rambling nonsense of the preacher.  "food from god"  Yeah, right.  it's food from people who saw fit to donate to a cause that they supported, (feeding the needy).  "God" had nothing to do with it, any more than he does with the turds coming out of a cow's asshole while it eats on the range.

And if you were traveling the world, you weren't exactly "available for work each and every day", were you?  That is a requirement to collect unemployment.  You also have to make a minimum of 3 contacts per week, and actively look for work.  I'm fully aware of WA State requirements for collecting unemployment insurance.

Once again, I spent one hour there, and got "paid" for my time by food.  Pretty good deal.  Considering I can live easily on less than $100/mo by myself, and with my wife and daughter, I can keep it under $150/mo.  It's not exactly hard to eat on a tight budget, but eating out is a luxury that only happens about once a season.  (just like it used to be when I grew up).

Define "learn something useful".  If you mean Medieval History of Europe, or XXX studies, or philosophy, I consider those useless pursuits.  If it's not a tangible skill, I have no interest in learning it.  If it can't generate income, there is no purpose to learning it.  I do not care about "being well rounded".  I care about putting money in my pocket, and nothing else.  Also, the last I checked, school doesn't pay you to be there.  Internships are full of shit, and an excuse for free labor.   




 The last war we explicitly fought for oil was Iraq in the early 90's, after Soddomy Insane invaded Kuwait.   Also, we don't get most of our oil from the ME.  We get it from USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and then Saudi Arabia.  

However, because we are now fracking, we could cut out Saudi oil, and it wouldn't really affect us.  In case you haven't checked, the world petroleum market is an international commodity.  You likely get fuel from Saudi Arabia too.

As far as domestic oil production, yes it is.  Maybe you've heard of Standard Oil?  They were broken up in 1911.  We now have Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Tesoro, etc.  All private industries. 




 Nope, we didn't directly fund them.  We directly funded the Mujahadeen which later became the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  We wanted to fuck with the USSR, and didn't really give a shit about the UK. 




 And I don't have the time for the Clinton/Sanders supporters.  Hillary is about as transparent as the walls of my house, and Sanders is a self-admitted socialist.  Democrats claim they want you to be successful, just not "too successful".  If Bill Gates wanted to pile up all his money, and create the world's biggest bonfire, he could.  If he wants to blow it on penny candy, or hookers and blow, he can.  He earned the money, he can do whatever he likes with it.  It's his money, not yours. 




 No shit we spend the most on education.  You can thank the NEA for that.  So obviously the solution isn't "throw more money at it".  I honestly think we should adopt Germany's way of doing it.  Have an academic track, and a blue-collar track.  Homogenized ANYTHING never works.  

People learn differently, and should be targeted with a curriculum that suits them, not what the NEA says everybody needs.  What use does a future plumber or welder have for French or Japanese?  Similarly, what use does a future accountant have for shop classes?  This is one lesson from Europe that the USA should take.  The Germans do it better, so we should do what China is so famous for, and copy them.

And fifth grade?  I could easily pass that.  Unless being multi-lingual is a requirement.  But if the classes were taught in English, not a problem. 




 Five times more?  Yeah right.  $20 for a checkup?  Sure, if it was 1995.  Here in the 21st century, we have to pay for services rendered.  If you think about it, a doctor's visit is actually still cheaper than going to an auto dealer and having your vehicle worked on for one hour.  Per flat rate hour, it's $160 to have a technician look at your vehicle.  Just want them to pull the codes? (takes all of 30 seconds), That'll be $80.  Minimum billable rate is a half hour.

And if you're unemployed and think you're "too good" for any work, you're a damned leech, and deserve no support.  If you can't find work, that's one thing, but if you turn down an offer of work, you're obviously not that needy, so you should get no support from society.  Back then, I would have shoveled shit if I had to.  I ended up going to work for a dealership as a lot jockey.  It's not glorious work by any means, but money is money. 




 Yes, it is.  Look at the former DDR, USSR, and today's DPRK.  All "working to communism".  Government control of everything. 




 Yes, by the fuel tax.  $0.18 federal tax, and $0.25 state tax.  Anybody who buys fuel pays for the roads.  They don't pull that money out of thin air, it's from fuel taxes.  The last I checked, fuel isn't free or subsidised.  Just because you pillocks in Europe pay asinine fuel taxes that make your fuel cost over $6/ga, doesn't mean that you have a better transportation network.  Outside of China, we have the largest developed road network in the world. 




 How's the IRA doing these days?  10 Downing Street been bombed lately? 




 On STATE and COUNTY roads, not the federal road network.  If it wasn't for JIT delivery, the interstate system could disappear right now, and I wouldn't notice a bit of difference.  

Petroleum is bought at the fuel station, (which is a privately owned business), shipped in large tanker trucks (also a private business), after being refined from oil, (also a private business), that was extracted from the ground by a large oil company, (also a private business).

Who's safety standards is my vehicle in compliance with?  Likely nobody's  It's a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer LT.  I know for a fact it wouldn't pass emissions.  But WA state doesn't have emissions checks outside of King and Spokane county.  Hell, I run a straight pipe.  I cut out the catalytic converter 5 years ago.

Education isn't "free".  Somebody is paying for it.  In the USA for K-12, it's the land owners that pay for the "free" education of primary and secondary school.  If you're poor enough, you can even make a little bit of money with the Pell grant system if you attend a community college.  

You won't be out a damned dime, all books would be covered, and you'll even make a little bit of money on top of that.  University is expensive.  About $25,000 a year for instate tuition, plus all the fees.  That's unreasonable, and the only way somebody could afford that without debt is to be independently wealthy, (or have connections).

And enrolling in school with a bunch of teens and 20 somethings is right in the list of my priorities the day after WWIII happens, and we bomb each other with dildos made out of silly putty.  College is completly useless at the community college level here.  I could get a degree in "customer service" for $12000, which would qualify me to .... work retail.  Yay.  Or you know, I can just go work retail, and skip all the debt and unneeded expenses.  Dropping 12k to get a 17.5k/year job.  Yeah, that's a good investment.  NOT.

Whoop de fucking doo, you're an engineer, and have more money than god.  I never will.  I've long given up on dreaming.  Dreaming happens when you sleep, and it isn't real.  People who still "dream" as adults have too much time on their hands, and need to get back to reality.  Life is what it is, and no amount of fantasizing of hoping or wishing will change it.

And for your information, I only went once back in 2010, and haven't went back yet.  (I have no need to).  In addition to giving them a whole truck load after that one time, I'll still occasionally buy a few extra things at IGA, and put them in the buggies that are set up for donations.  I've been there, and know how much it sucks, so if I can make somebody's day a little bit less sucky because I put in a flat of chilli, good.  It's not like it's expensive.  For $12, they get 15 cans. 




 Healthcare should have minimum standards as set by the CDC, (and they are), but beyond that, only emergent care should be subsidised.  For a regular checkup, pay the damned bill.  It's only $100.  I don't even remember the last time I even saw a doctor.  Yes, I make little enough that I do qualify for medicaid, but I don't even bother using it.  I really have no reason to see a doctor even once a year.

The church specifically isn't the best arbiter of where resources should go, but private charities are better than government largess.  Remember NOLA?  Who were the first trucks to deliver supplies there?  Was it Red Cross, or the national gaurd?  Nope.  It was Walmart.  They sent trucks in with batteries, potable water, propane tanks, tarps, etc.  All free.  Regarding articles:  Here you go:

http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/04/10/lesson-for-april-15-why-government-cant-replace-charity/

I've never heard a thing called Jesus syndrome, and no, there is no virtue in suffering.  It should be a temporary thing, (if it exists), not a lifestyle.  Hard times come, and hard times go.  But if they come and stay, the problem isn't with the system, it's with you.  If a person thinks they are "above" a job while unemployed, they have some twisted sense of reality.  Do whatever it takes to keep the lights on.  Dreams are for children, and reality takes the driver's seat once you're an adult.

Yes, socialism, is government control of the economy, while the corporation is worker-owned.  Communism is where the government owns and controls everything. from how many bolts will be made in XXX factory, to how many potatoes will be harvested that year, and who will receive those potatoes.  How's your Trabant running these days?  Did you just get your ration of Rondo today? 




 I drove there, and called them up to see what the hours of the food bank were, (I saw a flier on a pole, so I took the number, and called to verify).  I don't hardly ever use federal highways.  I travel on state/county/city roads almost exclusively.  I was last on the interstate last January.  Hell, the nearest interstate is over 75 miles north of me.

I've only done it once, (can't shoot a wheat field to get bread).  But yes, I did repay them back many times over.  I got maybe $50 worth of food, but once I went back to work, I loaded up my truck and gave them back $258 worth of food.  Unlike the government, where whatever they give you was compulsory taken from somebody else. private charities are willingly donated to.  

I'm 32 years old, and I'm willing to bet you're an early 20 something who think that the government is the best solution to all of society's ills.  If that were the case, the USSR would have never failed, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep people out, (like we do with Mexico), instead of people in.

Yeah, you probably got in free because you either greased some palms, or had connections.  I wouldn't go to school even if it were free.  I would only do it if it were free, all books were paid for, and I got paid at least $19,000 a year to attend.  That's never going to happen, so I'll never attend.  It's not worth it.  I could personally give a shit less about unions.  Join one if you want.  However, mandatory union membership should not exist anywhere. 




 There's a difference between knowing that what I do online is tracable by my ISP, (and even then, I could use a VPN if I wanted), versus the passive media of TV.  I don't really want my TV, and some goons at TWC or DirectTV seeing my bum and pillock because I'm too lazy to put on pants. 




 I bet you couldn't even pass a US citizenship test.  If you can't pass the test, you don't deserve the right to vote.  If you have no understanding of how the government operates, you deserve no say in how the nation is run. 




 If you're perpetually reliant on the government to sustain your daily life, that is effectively no different than a minor child being reliant on his parents to live. 




 I paid them back easily once I got a job.  I got maybe $50 in foodsuffs from them, but once I was back to work, I loaded up my truck, and drove over there with $258 worth of food. I boggled thier mind when I told them I have a donation, and I'm going to need help to unload it.  They were pleasantly surprised when they asked what I wished to donate, and told them "Everything in the truck"

That's the difference between private charities and government entities.  What the government gives out to somebody, they have forcibly taken from somebody else.  When a private charity gives out goods, those goods were willingly given to that charity without threat of force.  

Government should not be in the charity business, it should be left to the private sector.  They are more efficient, and know where resources are needed.  If the government were better at resource utilization, the USSR would have never fell, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep the west out, and not the East in. 




 What's that going to do?  I know "non-realtime communications".  But hell, I can do that now with reddit, and email.  non-realtime broadcasting would make no sense.  It's sent over the air, and goes to the TV.  To "time shift", I have this magical thing invented in the 70's called a "VCR".  (well, my VCR is from 1994). 




 You're a bleeding heart liberal that runs off of emotion, and uses no logic in consideration of who you cast your ballot for.  Feelings are your sole guide in life, and if somebody questions why you voted for a person, you probably resort to "you're a wacist".. 




 "I didn't smoke that much pot!  I'm a frying pan!" 




 I've actually toyed with this idea. " God: The parent who isn't there for adults who's parents weren't there". I've noticed that the most fervent believers have had either abusive parents, or absent parents who didn't give a shit about their kids. They had no father to seek solace in, so they seek solace in the feelings that their idealistic invisible sky daddy initiates when thought about. It's sad.
 




 I primarily use my phone for mobile internet access.  I would be perfectly fine at $0.45/min of calling time, and $0.50/text.  I'm on the phone maybe 20 min a month, and send maybe 2 texts a month.  If I had unlimited internet, I honestly wouldn't care what voice/text service I had. 




 He didn't?  News to me!  Let's publish it!  HEY EVERYBODY!  SHERLOCK NEvER TOOK A DUMP! :D 




  Brave New World is an apt comparison.  All the information is there for anybody who wants it, but most people are fine being Betas and Gammas, and don't want to read.  Soma and LOLcats are their obsession.  Don't forget the Touchy-Feelies over on /r/politics!  You want to read and be informed?  You must be a fag or something.  Wow, reality has become a dystopian novel. :( 




 My bedroom TV is from 2002, and it doesn't even have a ATSC tuner in it.  I have it plugged direct into the wall, going through a QAM converter box to pick up digital channels.  I WON'T rent a cable box.  I don't want the CATV company seeing what I watch on my own private line.  Fuck targeted advertising.  If the day ever comes where I can't just plug in the line, and do a channel scan, I'm dumping CATV.  I've already started hooking up my "new" antenna.  I just have to figure out how to build a YAGI. 




 I'm not a Luddite.  I don't fear technology is going to put me out of work, (I'll do anything), nor am I technologically adverse.  I just don't like GPS, cameras, or mics.  (unless I'm taping something).  Yes, I still use my VCR.  My laptop is outdated enough, (Eee PC 1000HD), that Windows XP fully updated takes about 45 minutes to boot.  Windows 7 took 20 minutes.  

I completely got rid of Windows on it back in 2011, and replaced it with Debian running LXDE as the DE.  I have WINE 1.7 installed, so I CAN run Win32 programs if I really want to.  I haven't found a need to yet.  I'm thinking about swapping out my HDD for a SSD to make it boot faster, but it works fine for me.  I run Debian Sid.  I run Windows 10 on my desktop, but as far as portability and performance are concerned, Windows can go blow goats. 




 32 earth years as humans measure time. 




 My laptop is from 2009, and has no camera.  My phone is a SGSI, and has no front facing camera.  My truck is from 1997, and has the second year of OBDII diagnostics.  No GPS at all.  I don't even own a gaming platform The last one I even used was the SNES, back in 1994. 




 Can you now cram a half a loaf of bread into a pill? Are you a blue whale? 




 Round wheels are outdated. Replace them with tracks. 




 I refuse to buy one.  My cell phone is a SGS I.  No front camera.  When I did have my SGS III, I put black tape over the front lens.  I don't want a front facing camera. 




 [YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT!  FOR YOUR RIGHT! TO PAAAAAAARTY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk) 




 My laptop is from 2009, and I don't use webcams or mics.  I won't buy a laptop with a webcam or mic already installed. My desktop doesn't have a mic or a webcam, and I don't want one either.

Regarding my phone.  I'm on it so little that I'd be fine with a PDA with internet-only service, and calling rates at $0.45/min.  I don't even text that much.  Maybe 2 messages a month. 




 IN SOVIET RUSSIA... TV WATCHES YOU! (Hmm, smart TV's in the USA. Hits a little bit close to home eh?) The TeleScreen out of 1984 is here, and PEOPLE CLAMOR TO BUY ONE!! It was supposed to be a warning, not a "I want this" book! :( It's already bad enough that we have the "TV Walls" directly out of Fahrenheit 451, and the earbuds as described in that novel. Yes, I like my earbuds as much as the next dude, but when the TV watches YOU, technology has gone too far. I will never own a smart TV. I'd rather smash my TV with a hammer than buy that shit. 









 A train traveling through the DDR is carrying Stalin, Krushchev, and Breznev through the Urals. It breaks down.

Stalin lines up the crew of the train, the local villagers, and the passengers, and shoots every 5th person.

Krushchev lines up the survivors and gives them a rousing speech about how much better Soviet trains will run in 7 years.

Breznev sits back down, pulls the blind shut, bounces up and down in his seat, and pretends the train is still running.

The DDR politburo votes themselves out of office because the train won't run.

:D 




 [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/41208764?reviews_limit=9 ) for 3% solution.  Want 90%?  Qualifies as rocket fuel, and you need clearance from DHS to import it, but [here you go](http://www.peroxidepropulsion.com/hydrogen-peroxide.php).  I think it's around $5/lb.


 **EDIT:** You probably need clearance from BATFE and the FBI too.  And you thought gasoline was expensive?   Pure H2O2 is around $40/ga. 




 Liberals, (and people who vote on nothing but emotion), are the complete morons. Not me.  "feelings" should have no say in political decisions. 




 So you're saying the blowhard His Highness Jessie Jackson **does** represent all black people? 




 The LD50 is 2g/KG.  a 4.5 OZ chug would kill 50% of people weighing 150LBS.

 Post offices:  Where you get mail.

Post Roads:  Roads used to transport the mail.  See *Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States* (1833).

http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_7s7.html 




 Nobody represents anybody except for themselves.  Just like that windbag Jessie Jackson doesn't represent black people. 




 Yes, a couple of times I've had to go to the church food bank just to keep food on the table, (I had meat from the deer, but nothing else).  I'll sit through a sermon to get bread and chilli, and 1 can of soda, and pinto beans.  It's humiliating, but if it keeps my wife and daughter fed, I'll do it.  It sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do to keep food on the table.

Yes, I would much rather be independent, and get off of assistance as fast as possible, but being unemployed for 7 months not knowing how to keep the lights on, or where your next meal is coming from kind of sucks.  Actually, it sucks a lot.  I didn't have to worry about losing my place, because I paid a year ahead.  I got CATV because I have cable tools.  I wasn't ballsy enough to fuck with the electric box.  That shit can, (and will), kill you, (if you don't burn alive first).

Temporary stop-gap measures are one thing, (that's why safety nets exist, to keep you from falling to your metaphorical death), but it's a net, not a damned hammock.  I gave up my daughter for adoption later, because I reasoned "if I can't even feed myself without resorting to poaching and begging churches, how the hell am I going to feed a kid?  I can't even afford diapers for her, and she's using my old shirts."  I went on a 15 mile walk that day, and almost didn't come back home.  I was thinking one thing that day.  "Head south".  Where I was going?  I have no clue beyond "south". I got a ride back to town with the county sheriff.  My wife called me in, and the sheriff convinced me to get in his rig so he could take me back home. 




 I got no problems with the income tax, I fully expect to support the DOD with my dollars, (hey, I live here too, and if the Russians invade, the USMC and Navy are the first line of defence).  But to support old fuckers who live off of the dole on SSI who contribute nothing to the economy, (and never will again).  Fuck that shit.  Also "sin tax" is full of shit too.
 




 Where you came to the fight defending liberals.  Since you defend them, you are one. 




 Well, you did self ID as a liberal.  That makes you a Communist, Socialist, Green, or Democrat.  And since all of these parties have no chance in hell, I'm willing to bet you vote Democratic. 




 The US Constitution actually explicitly authorises "Post offices and Post Roads".  (Article I, section 8).  It's not an "either-or" proposition.  It's "within the confines of the constitution" proposition.  Also, the Federal government only pays for the US road network, and Interstate system.  County roads are paid by the county, city roads by the city, and state routes by the state.  The Federal government really has very little say in the road infrastructure. 




 Depends on what taxes. 




 Actually, I would expect people raised by parents who can't keep to a simple buget to be more advantaged.  They saw what not living within your income will do.  (power shut off, loss of cable TV, having to sell drugs just to make ends meet, eviction, etc).  That is a good lesson on what **NOT** to do.  

Yes, there is a difference between taking SNAP in a temporary situation, and making a lifesyle out of it.  If you need it temporarily because you honestly can't afford to feed your family, or if you "poach" a deer for nothing but the meat, (I didn't see anything).  Shit happens, and a temporary helping hand (or a blind eye), can work wonders.  But if you make a lifestyle choice out of being a welfare queen, then you should be thrown out on the streets, and have all your benefits cut for life.

I've been within 12 hours of having my utilities cut, and I went hat in hand to CAC for emergency electricity assistance.  I've got it once.  I was literally looking at having my power cut in the middle of January, and Project Share through Avista kept my lights on.  That was the most embarrassing day of my life.  I shot a whitetail deer that year to keep my family fed, and I didn't have a license.  I did it out of need, not want.  (it was out of season anyways, so I couldn't have gotten a licence even if I wanted to).  But then again, if I could afford the hunting license, I wouldn't be illegally harvesting game, would I?

Yes, sometimes times can get tough, and people do need a helping hand, but if you make it a lifestyle, you're a fucking mooch, and should be thrown out on your ass.  BTW, I don't have my parents to rely on.  My dad died in 2010.  My mom is too busy traveling the country to CA and AZ outrunning the cold.  I have my step-mom.  I've only called her once, and that was when I stupidly parked in a neighbor's parking spot and got a $500 tow bill for one day.  I owe her that money back, and I fully intend to repay her, (whenever I can scare up the $380 that I have remaining).

 Then you have SSI, and SSDI in case of an intractable severe mental of physical illness.  Those are special cases.  I was thinking more along of the welfare queens who crank out children so they can get TANF and food stamps, and section 8 housing, and Medicaid.  They don't work because they don't want to, not because they physically cannot.  If you had shitty parents, it's time to grow up and learn to make your own way in the world.  

I grew up upper-middle income, and at 32 years old, I make less than $20,000 a year.  Hell, the most I ever made was $10/hr in 2008.  Adjusted for inflation, that's $11.12/hr in today's dollars.  I honestly don't think I'll ever earn $80,000 a year, or even $24000 a year, (adjusted for inflation).  Still, there is value in independence, and not having your ass pampered by the "all knowing and all caring government". 




 I know about the Demon-craptastic party, and that's enough for me.
 




 No more than you liberals wanting Uncle Sam to be your daddy. while remaining a perpetual dependent child. 




 The desire to be free to do as I like, so long as I don't harm anybody else.  Also, I view government dependence as a negative thing.  You're an adult, rely on yourself; not the government.

The first man says "I'll have some H2O!"

The bartender pours the man a glass, and the first man gets refreshed.

The second man says "I'll have some H2O too!"

The bartender pours the man a glass, and the second man dies.

 Turn it down you say

Well, all I got to say to you is time and time again I say

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no" 




 It may be fake, (it is), but it's still funny. :)  (IIRC, the joke goes back to the 1920's.) 









 AKA:  Cougar. 




 Looks like a Puma to me. 




 Yes, most of the time.  They mostly want to be left alone, and are human adverse.  They only wander into human territory if they are extremely hungry, and intend to get meat wherever they can.  On the ranch, they'll attack your livestock.  But if you shoot at it, (well, in front of it), it'll run.  Pumas are also known as a mountain lion, or a cougar.
