 Come back and tell me your thoughts about the movie! 




 Are you kidding me...if you wouldn't tap that then there's something wrong with you. http://imgur.com/ozQi8OG 




 Samuel L. Jackson played a small role for a Lifetime movie exclusive that nobody saw.....I Win. 




 Jake Gyllenhaal. Have you seen Prisoners or Nightcrawler? Sheeeesh 




 I saw that the first time I saw the trailer. 




 Prisoners (2013)   Nightcrawler (2014). Both star Jake Gyllenhaal and both were my favorite movies of the year that that came out. I feel like I have similar tastes to you in movies! Nightcrawler is on Netflix, check it out! 




 What is he talking about??? Margot Robbie is FINEEEEE 




 Yea, you lost me when you mentioned the Star Wars prequels. I really hope 'The Force Awakens' furthers the plot with some more fun senate meetings! 




 I liked them too, but since the fanboy-dom died down in me since my viewing I can objectively look back and say they weren't up to par with some of their good movies. Ant-Man was good though. Just go into it like its a fun heist movie and you'll be pleased. 




 Same boat. Atleast it wasn't the flop everyone was expecting or the travesty that Ironman 2, Ironman 3, and Captain America 1 were. 




 Skinny Jeans, my enormous manhood would not be complacent under such a claustrophobic habitat. 




 I like the funny stuff too :) 




 Aren't we all.

 What is YOUR theory as to why we live, why we were placed on earth for, our purpose to continue to live? 




 What the hell is a 'dingy'? 




 I didn't know Mr. Freeze had a cat?! 




 Yessir, I watched it today! 




 My Art I teacher told us that purple doesn't exist but he said he "didn't want to get into it" and taught us the lesson. Not only that but he'd get mad if we used the term purple, he said that it was incorrect and that the correct term was violet. I always that the two were interchangable. 




 Damn seals 




 Slightly ear static-y with a touch of ambient buzzing 




 ""Go" is actually the shortest sentence."  is actually quite a long sentence. 




 These are comic book movies, they don't kill of comic book characters...Ant-Man 2: Antony's Revenge 




 Why did he care that Antony died but their were a bunch of Ants left and right that were dying. 




 Just got back from the theaters? Not sure if the Hosts care much about the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe, but maybe some of you do. So, what did you guys think that have seen the movie? What did you like, what didn't you like and what would you rate it from 0.0 to 10
