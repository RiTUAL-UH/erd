 Knowing the value of a dollar. I'm by no means rich, or a trust fund baby. But my family has provided for me, I don't ask for too much to begin with. We live comfortably but I think I still take a lot for granted like education, food, and housing from the parental units. 




 My great x3 grandma was an Eisenhower. Her sister was Dwight Eisenhower's grandma. Blood relatives to Dwight Eisenhower b-otch. 




 I've always personally thought that it would be Leonardo Da Vinci. He had himself immersed in so many different fields and abilities that he would have accomplished a lot. 




 Wots...uh the deal and mudmen are the best moments of the album for me 




 I've had the same exact thought, except with religions. Not too be too antagonizing, just a thought I've had 




 Tom Hanks 




 Concerts, not talking about the thrash metal ones where people are literally throwing themselves at each other on purpose (This is definitely seems harmful). I'm talking about any concert where there is standing room in the front and people just try to crowd to the front. The amount of dehydration that occurs in conjunction with any drugs/alcohol can make people faint and get trampled on. I'm sure this seems pretty harmful, but you'd be surprised.

 I think it's incredible that even at a younger age, Eddie was cognizant enough to make this correct decision. It must've been tough with one of your greatest motivators gone. 




 I love college basketball, I'm absolutely down to do this, and I frequent /r/collegebasketball it's a decent community, nothing too bad happens, and users are pretty friendly even between rival teams 




 Futurama   it's always sunny in Philadelphia  




 Charging me a ridiculous electric bill without having a worker check the meter. Estimates are bull shit. 




 My roommates and I usually run an electric bill of about $120. That's a lot for us, but ya'know being in college up all hours of the night + computers + appliances, it's not hard to believe we spend that much. However, this month, the electric company charged us $240, which truly surprised all of us. So basically, my roommate called up the power company, and after some circular logic and avoiding an answer. Our bill turned out to be a more reasonable $130. How can they over charge $110 without even caring? Should be a law or something in place?


EDIT: is it the style of the meter that's outdated or just the meter? Because our apartment complex is brand new. 




 Oh god my girlfriend has these 




 cheers dude 




 I really follow along with twitch, so any good streamers will be watched by me, thanks homie. 




 Ive been a long time civilization revolution player, and am still adjusting to the new and more expansive civ 5. I don't have any of the expansion map packs/scenarios. I know how the game works, I've played a few. I was wondering if there were any help sites that would help the transition to go smoother. 




 Anyone else experience having their rank reset in H2A? I was about a 12-13. Got reset back to 1 and I've been steadily playing since just to see if it was just bugged on my screen, but it isn't. Im back up to 6 and it was just out of the blue.

EDIT:  sorry computer users, I just want the good Ol days

EDIT 2: I didn't restart the game after the reset 




 Ahhhh, thanks for the clarification. Still awesome in it's own right. 




 Hmm I haven't given Piper it's credit. I've only listened to it a handful and never knew about the literary influences on it. Maybe I'll have to read the book and get back to the album. 




 After the discussion about Amused To Death the other day on here. It got me thinking about what the general fans in /r/pinkfloyd like to read. Because Amused To Death is a nod to [Neil Postman's Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) "Amusing Ourselves To Death" which talks about the books "1984" and "A Brave New World" and his conjecture about which is happening to society. Also Pink Floyd's Animals album is largely influenced by [Animal Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) by George Orwell. So there are two distinct albums that are directly influenced by literature. So I'm assuming that since PF is intertwined with literature, so must their fan base. What are some of your guy's favorite books? 




 Listened to this album today actually! Great album, I think my least favorite is What God Wants Pt. 1. I get the full message of the song, I just think he kinda belabors the point, and the song becomes static. 




 I was in middle school when school of Rock came out. Jack Black tells the girl singer to go listen to this song to learn more and appreciate music. My first pink Floyd song I ever heard. The rest is history. 




 The Division Bell is my go-to studying album. Such an effortless album to listen through, I love it. 




 When? 




 Yep I was in a very similar situation, and I was angry too. But I took my menial existence as a freedom to do what I loved. Not freedom to say whatever the hell I want and make people feel like shit. Too much /r/atheism is about pointing out christians in society and getting a hard-on about how pathetic they are. That's not what I am or ever will be about. 




 /r/atheism, I personally would identify as an atheist, but I wouldn't identify as an arrogant ass hole 




 I love this song, gotta give this album another spin 




 I personally like it more than The Wall and Meddle. I like echoes more than anything on obscured by clouds. But I think OBC as a complete project is better than Meddle. 




 This song and mudmen are my favorite from the album. These two songs back to back are so gnarly 




 Some parts of AHMS can definitely compete with Echoes, I love the choir in harmony with Rick's playing. There are some parts I dislike with both songs, but Echoes is easily the more powerhouse song. Echoes's story is just flat out beautiful.

EDIT: I just listened to it again and holy hell... anyone else think 17:50 to 18:00 sounds similar to Echoes? 




 OP edited wiki page? 




 It used to be dogs, but Sheep is my favorite now. It's so fun to listen to with Rogers vocals blending into the synthesizers. 




 This song makes me wanna drive down the highway at 200mph

Probably  my only real surprise to anyone is The Wall, that album just never really hit me hard, although I'm giving more and more of an effort to fully appreciate it 




 It's a great song, I just feel that it gets kinda redundant when I listen to it. The message of the song changes, but the sound can be static. Still a powerful song though 




 I've tried browsing around the Internet but I need something in more layman terms.

 Ya really fucked up the title on this one OP. And you make it seem like there's a contingent of people actively telling people not to draft. Is this a real thing? Also I'm against it because I don't want an asshole tailgating me and then reading a text and knocking me into the median. 




 Pink Floyd were one of the starters of Prog Rock, along with King Crimson. Listen to Pink Floyd, they are so much more than a stoner band and a T-shirt with the dark side of the moon album cover that the skateboarder in your 9th grade gym class used to wear. If ya need anywhere to start ask me or /r/pinkfloyd has an awesome and open community 




 Newspapers and bookstores are in the same boat in my opinion. They'll still be around for years to come, but in decreasing physics copies as the digital age takes over. Newspaper companies will still write articles as much as ever, it'll probably just be mainly people reading on their iPhone14's

 I agree this sub needs more discussion, im hesitantly volunteering to post the daily discussion threads, as long as mods are cool with it. Hell it'd be more convenient if one of them ran it, but I would do my best to do it everyday 









 Damn, I forgot they updated yearly, and it is a new year. Thanks for the shout mate haha 




 Uhhhhh? But you can? 




 No worries man haha 




 I see where you're coming from and I totally agree. I'm not the first to say this either but we live in a society where everyone gets a gold medal and no one finishes last. We don't have that American grit anymore. There's a difference between grit/toughness and rubbing people the wrong way. Unfortunately people get rubbed the wrong way and everyone has to take sensitivity classes. I've been harassed, not to the scale that many others have, but I've always just taken it on the chin, because they're just words. 




 I mean I'm not particularly offended by it, I just know that this would not be recreated in today's society, and figured it'd give an interesting/almost humorous look into history. It's obviously a caricature of what a stereotypical Japanese citizen/soldier would look like. And it calls them a "Jap" which is considered a racial slur. Again, I'm not personally offended, just explaining. 














 That's awesome! I never noticed that, I love how much detail the writers put into this show. It seems like I could learn something new from an episode each time I watch it. 




 I'm pretty sure that Eddie Van Halen's son, Wolfgang (I think that's his name), is the bassist for the band now. I know he used to be touring with his dad.

Sorry to nominate 2 pink Floyd albums but I couldn't pick one and I felt both are worth at least a nomination since this isn't the actual poll. 




 That's a shame, and I'm sorry to hear that. Luckily they haven't had that negative effect on me  




 I haven't run into those people, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It makes sense though 




 Ok 




 I can see that, I'm one of the people that thought it was stoner wanna-be's that listened to them. Then I gave them a real look and realized that pink Floyd is beyond all that and I don't associate my fandom with drugs at all
