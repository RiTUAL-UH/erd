 oh, sorry, i didnt recognize you, you look different than from when i'm on my knees going down on a girl 




 like i said, i know plenty of girls who still have a functioning penis, and who regularly use it. One thing's for sure, you will NEVER lack for partners. it's amazing how many propositions i get on OKCupid. Trans girls are at the top of a lot of people's fuck bucket list. hell, when i came out, all my gay AND lesbian friends wanted to sleep with me. it was hilarious. 




 i'm a 42 year old adult trans girl lesbian who shared so many of his fears that as a result ran so far deep into the closet that i was eating pussy in Narnia. 














 it's complicated, i dont mind having a penis, i just dont like using it for sex (dysphoria is a bitch). i never felt they were the right bits to be on a girl, so i always had an aversion to penetrative sex. add to that, i lean more asexual now and you pretty much get a penis that doesnt work anymore.
 

















































 went for the hormones, yes. but i still have the naughty bits, lots of girls do. i know several who love using it. for me, because i'm asexual, i really have no attachment to the parts one way or another. i just dont want to risk the surgery. maybe that will change, but for now, i'm happy the way i am. 

and when it comes to my partners(i'm poly) i'll rock the strap-on and fuck them seven ways from sunday.  









 i've known some trans people who have changed orientation. i used to get off on forced fem and tgirl porn. once i transitioned, i drifted towards the asexual side of the spectrum. my attraction tho, didnt change, i was definitely still into girls. 

also, as a girl, orgasms are WAY better. (jes sayin) 














 you know, for the longest time, i tried to convince myself i was a straight crossdresser, that dressing was my fetish. but that urge wasnt just an urge to dress up, it was an urge to be female. dressing kinda scratched the urge, and for the longest time it was enough, until it started to become more  insistent as i got older, and then it became this NEED to be a girl.

So i transitioned, pretty much because i didnt really have a choice anymore. i had to become who i knew i was 




 i dunno how the thread devolved into a discussion about Intelligent Design, but.... people ACTUALLY believe that? like, REAL people actually believe in I.D.? 









 maybe if you had previously read up on that particular area, i dont think it's widely known outside that particular area of specialization tho 




 dont forget Santorum, Steve King, Huckabee, Scott Lively, Glenn Beck, O'Rielly, et al 




 well, that's easy, Romney advocated "self-deportation" a term that was minted back in the 90's as satire, but what the GOP took as an actual position.

Donald Trump is currently saying that Mexicans are rapists.

most of the base of the republican party is white, and they dont like the NON-white people all that much 









 because Science sometimes has to catch up with common sense. we KNOW we do it, Science gives us the reasons WHY we do it.

twas always thus, and always thus shall be 




 i found it relevant considering Walker's position on immigration, which, coincidentally, reflects the position of the GOP in general towards the 12 million illegal immigrants in the country. 









 that's probably the most succinct breakdown i've read so far  









 i'm kinda late to this thread, but here are my thoughts.

1) if it's not bleeding too bad, monitor it for awhile and if it still doesnt improve, go to the ER/urgent care(or equivalent) and get treatment for it there.

2) make an appointment with a therapist. please. i dont know the reasons behind your attempt, but i know you were prolly in a really dark place. it's one that a lot of us recognize from past experiences. but the spiral doesnt always have to lead downwards, you have to find a way to change that path. please, please, PLEASE make an appointment with a therapist. 





























 apparently, slightly more than half of the people who showed up to vote 




 you're human, and a unique one at that. gender exists on a really broad spectrum, and we spend a lot of time figuring out where the hell we land on it. took me dang near 40 years before i acknowledged that i was a girl. i've known since i was 7, but denial is a helluva thing. i was stuck so far deep in the closet that i was munching carpet in Narnia.

dont let society dictate what you can and cannot do. now that's not to say that there wont be consequences, depending on where you live, being creative in your gender presentation might encourage some backlash. but to be true to yourself is the only way to be happy. 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeup

it is either a glorious thing, or a horrendous thing.... i havent quite figured out which it is going to be 




 you're welcome! it was a very interesting read for me too. 









 ;-) 









 YES, WE KNOW... BUT WHY ARE WE SHOUTING??!! 




 outstanding use of the word "corpulent" 




 Then go on blockers, it'll give you time to figure out if you are trans or not. the only one who can answer that question is you. and blockers just push puberty off for a little while longer. that way you can try life as a girl if you want, to see if it IS what you want. not everyone who goes on blockers transitions. but they're all happy that it gave them time to sort things out.

i say go for it. get yourself an appointment with a therapist, and an endo, and get on blockers as quickly as you can. buy yourself some time to figure it out.

*edit: i accident a word 




 exactly 




 hell, i moved countries to transition, and it STILL took me til i darned near hit 40 before i came out. we do what we have to do.  









 and so you are!

;-)

i post on /r/transspace if you want the news 




 on a side note, i see i'm not the only one who comes back to check on other girls  




 why is it scary? to find out who you really are? that's the whole point in life, is it not? 




 you can come over to /r/asktransgender if you had questions 




 ha, i came out two weeks after my 39th. i figured i had to do it before i hit 40 



















 sometimes the fever has to get worse before it breaks 




 plenty of us start off here, you're not the first, nor will you be the last. And it's never too late, i came out at 39. Come on over to /r/asktransgender, you might find a few answers there. 




 pssst, that's the whole point. the more we talk, the longer he sticks around. this is great. i didnt think the GOP could look any worse.... i was wrong 












































 but..... free weed!!!!  
























 hmmm, maybe i should change that. i do try and comment in the threads as much as i can. it's kind ahard right now cuz i JUST started a new job, but i should be commenting more as i settle in. 

But as far as this sub goes, we're all trying to moderate it in as fair a manner as we can. and we all discuss everything before we do it. That's why this was stickied, because we all wanted to get input from everyone.

i'm really sad to see anyone go, because this sub exists to help all us transies, both new and old. 

















































 so you're saying there's a chance it was..... 
































































 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup 














 i know, i know

i really shouldnt post from my phone. i'm also asian, so my shame knows no bounds. 




 heya Chel! 




 i'll allow it ;-) 




 no, but there's really no good reason to deny people the right to marry more than one person 

























































































 It's been 34 years since the New York Times frontpaged a story on "Homo Cancer"..... It seems forever in internet time, but it really wasnt all that long ago. 



































































































































































































































































 psssst, the frothy one
