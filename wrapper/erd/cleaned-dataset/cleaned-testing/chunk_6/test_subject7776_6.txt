 no need to be rude about it man.. 




 Just put a 5.0 in the Mach and go crazy.
I'm biased though since I like the New Edge look and the Mach look. 




 Beats mine, man. I would kill to upgrade. 




 nope. 




 AWH SHIT, YA GOT ME WITH MY 12 YEAR OLD.
How will I ever survive now.. 




 So cool to be an asshole, jeez man, it's his car. Fuck off if you don't like it. He can do whatever he wants.
I think it's pretty cool, since I've only seen it once. 




 72k miles in 2 years? 




 Is that a bad thing?
-cracks knuckles- 




 Any more pictures? I'm jealous! 




 Just got her. 









 Well, shit.. 




 Fuck yeah man, manual widows! And someone said that there's an auto detailing subreddit, which could help with the paint and stuff, so you might wanna check that out! 




 Yeah, I'm not a fan of them, but it's what I gotta deal with for a tiny bit of time, and it's the least of my worries.
I will check out auto detailing, and see what they recommend! Thank you! 




 I got her for 1750$, which, for what it is, was surprising. I might need to do a new engine in the future, but I think it will last me at least some time, since I'll mainly only use it to get to work which is ~10 minutes away at most.
I don't plan on running it hard. Thankfully! 




 I'm dumb, I read interior.
Yeah, I mean there's some fading, only on the front by the headlights, so it's not too bad. I will definitely try my best to keep it as clean and nice as possible. 




 Yes, yes it does. That was the main thing I was looking for! 




 I feel you, I don't love it, but it's sort of grown on me since after looking for a car, they're all I can find!
I need to deoxy the headlights, touch up some paint, and she'll be a beaut!
Thank you for the kind words. 




 Believe me, I HATE when people try to make a car something its not.
I haven't gotten it up to anything, unless you count 15-20ish "up", I need to go get tags and all that fun stuff since I literally just got it.
I'm quite excited to play around with it! 




 '95 v6 5 speed 









 I was gonna give you a baby for the 5.0.. damn. 




 Please. 




 Oh I know, its one of the the few blues that I actually have interest in, and holy shit, that must be a thing to see. I've only ever seen one Mach in my area and it was a cobra swap, not as cool other than the glass window in the hood where the shaker was and the neon lights. :P 




 Yeah, its definitely a nice crowd, I've been looking at the Machs, specifically the Azure Blue with a new Engine in it. 




 I've been looking at them for so long, just drooling over them. SVTPerformance has so many great termis, that it hurts to log on to it :( 




 Am I the only one who hasn't gotten one yet.
God damn it. 




 They look purpleish-blue to me. 




 Jack/Geoff 




 Fucking lovely.
Nice ride man. 




 Oh I do too, Currently trying to talk to my credit union to see if I can get it. 




 And guns! 




 You're just made of cash and cars, aren't you, Mister? 




 Just bought the book. 




 So, you would like to use that nickname?
[YES]         [NO] 




 Are you sure?

[YES]         [NO] 




 Are you sure?
[YES]       [NO] 




 Inbox it bro
 




 Nawh brah, you don't, you wouldn't be player hatin' 




 Its a Shelby Cobra emblem. 




 brah, gtfo, we don't want you anyways. go enjoy your civic. 




 Yeah, that's what I use. Hoping they'll give me enough for a decent new edge. :D 




 Brah, brah, please. I'm trying to get a loan right now to join the cool kids club. 




 Good. Bitch. 




 OP, pls... 




 Thats an insanely clean Saleen, any more details? And Karma? This subreddit gets MAYBE 10 upvotes hahaha. ;) 




 I rarely find colors that I like, but lava really is beautiful, so is Mystichrome but we can't get that nowadays factory. 




 God I love lava red... 




 Come on Heer_, you're making me a bit too jealous. :(

Gorgeous like always, but maybe a bath would be in need soon. ;P 




 You're all in /r/wtf, did you expect ponies and rainbows. Expect NSFW/L, Gore, ect...  




 So he's a GRAPIST too? 




 Thank you for your answer, and I understand it's a stressful job, and they give you no slack. I've been actually doing really fine, no problems, but then again I still have 9 months until I can MAYBE join, so we'll see if anything changes. Thanks again! 




 Ooooh, I get you! 




 That's my bike. 




 But there is also more v6s than v8s, so that kinda helps out v6s in the lead here. Not saying your wrong though, driver error and neglect is a big part, and I was saying that since he's a teen, he's not gonna be the best at handling power, and paying attention. 




 Idk, I've seen some really stupid football players. No offense to your son, or your family name. And I'm not doubting you, I'm just saying! Hopefully he is mature enough to handle that beautiful beast, and tell him I said congrats on getting a ride to college! It's a lot more than I could have done, haha! 




 Awesome! Thanks! 




 You're 120hp lower than him, though. 




 He's gonna crash it, bet ya 10$. 




 Has no one realized, that they shouldn't use Red Box? 




 I like them, they have a lot of special editions in those years, like the Mach 1, Cobra, Crimson red 40th, Roush, and Saleen which all look incredible. In my opinion they have the best rear of any Mustang, but power isn't huge unless you get a Mach, which has the equivalent power of a recent V6, or a 03/04 Cobra since that's 390hp.  




 *oh* 




 I would definitely go back to golden brown, man. 




 I feel you. I'm going for a Mach 1 in about a month, hopefully I'll have enough funds to get it. I really want a TR 10th Termi but that'll run me 22+ for what I want with it. 




 SVTPerformance has them from 17-35 depending on mods/mileage. Pretty good stuff! 




 WHYY! 




 Hahahah! 




 OP pls respond. 




 Hudson River was a Narrow body, OP is talking about Wide body.
Source:All dem comments. 




 She's 15, not 5. 




 ITT: Suddenly everyone cares about feelings. 




 Yeah, the Mach 1s were styled from the 69's and 70's, hence the style of the gauges, stripes (side and hood), spoiler, hell even the seats! I think they look really good TBH, it's way different from the other NewEdges. 




 I know, he takes care of it! And yes they are factory! 




 Ouch dude, that blows. Thankfully you're alright! Hopefully you get what you want out of this, like you said, a V8! 




 Yeah, hopefully! haha. It's beautiful. 




 Nice, a lightning! 




 My god. 




 It looks really good for it's age.
Nice NewEdge man! 




 C'mon pls. 




 Aww, I feel so bad for him. 




 This is 5 days old, I don't know why you thought the input was needed. 




 I give them credit, that was pretty clever. 




 xD!! 2Funneh! 




 What the fuck. 




 PlS dO ThaT!  




 He's "eye" has a small Purple Heart inside of it. He's probably not ashamed by it and decided to not care, I mean if I had a Purple Heart in my eye, that'd be sick as shit. 




 *EDIT* I'm challenged, didn't scroll far enough.

My bad dood.  




 I could see the preview on mobile and I still clicked it... What's wrong with me. 




 Oh god, it is weird. 




 Dude... 




 Yeah, let me show off my daughter in hopes someone will want to visit my shop.
Yup. 




 I'd love to help! Don't get me wrong, but I need to focus more on my life and helping myself get through and over obstacles. I will return though to help out. :) 




 Yeah, I'd definitely try to see how low I can go. And probably look at terminators too, since they're my dream car. Gonna be hard to find a TR 10th for under 20k :( 




 Thank you, if I feel down in the dumps, I most definitely will be back for a check up. :) 




 Thank you, that made me laugh! 




 Ha! 




 Thank you all for your kind worded comments. I woke up with a huge smile on my face. :) 




 Cool brah. 




 I replied to the guy who replied to you. It was aimed at both of you, and if you'd like you can read it as reply.

Thank you for your input, and I understand where you're coming from. :) 




 It's definitely about how you look at it.
I understand that it's hard, and you get yelled at, which is fine. It toughens you up. I've wanted to join since I was a small child, it is about pride to me and about the benefits of college, friendship, and strengthening myself. My uncles have gone through it all, and one of my only friends has been enlisted for little over a year in the Marines. Whilst another is currently in BT for the Army.

Yeah you can get lonely, homesick, and all that. But that's life, and that's what I choose.

Thank you, and the guy you commented to, for both of your inputs. I greatly appreciate it! 




 Thank you. 




 Cobras are my favorite. If you have more pictures, r/NewedgeMustang would love to see it. :) 




 Idk man, either way she doesn't look like a Chloe. PERSONAL OPINION RIGHT HERE THOUGH. 




 [Idk man, she looks like Ellen Page.](http://i.imgur.com/BSGQ5I1.jpg) 




 Really hoping to get a NewEdge as soon as I land my job interview tomorrow. ;) 









 Thankfully this one only puts down 405, and not 600's like some of them. ;) 




 That a big fucking probably. 




 Ah, now I see! Would love to see it when you have the new wheels!
