 I didn't say that, etzhadaat did. You, however, said that no one, and thus no Republican, has ever said that, when quite clearly there were some who did say this. 




 All I ever hear from Republicans is that we should let the poor die because they haven't earned our hand-outs.

No one has ever said that. Ever.

I guess you didn't catch the Republican primary debates this year. The audience cheered and shouted "yes, yes" when the moderator said "do you think people without health insurance should just be allowed to die?" 




 What is "Darwinism" supposed to be--a complete worldview that is somehow built on the scientific theory of evoluton?

In the mind of conservative Christians, yes, that's what it is. Is that what scientists actually believe? No, but the article was about how this group perceives science, not how science actually operates. 














 It's free on iTunes, at least it was. But yeah, well worth the six bucks - Carlin is awesome. 




 Cool I will with-hold my skepticism. There have just been too many false claims in the field for me to put too much hope in any one company. Quantum computing was starting to seem like the cold fusion of the computing world. If they really have made some breakthroughs, that would be epic. 




 Here's what I've heard from some people who are "in the know" (or at least plausibly claim to be):

Far from being "material," our universe is actually a very dense form of spiritual power. The point is to compress it to a level that it basically ignites, sort of like nuclear fusion. Consciousness appearing at the "material" level is the spark of that ignition. 














 The CIA also invested millions in psychic "remote viewing." D-wave has always smelled scammy to me - they've been promising huge breakthroughs for over five years now with nothing to show for it. 




 IIRC from a documentary on the subject, this was tried and it didn't work. The algorithms came back with the result that the text was most likely gibberish and there was no code hidden within it. A lot of historians think the manuscript is a hoax (though an old hoax) that was cooked up by some "alchemist" as a secret text and then sold to a gullible nobleman for a tidy sum. Not everyone accepts that conclusion though. 




 To be fair this is only the O'Reilly/Limbaugh wing and Romney and Ryan saying this. The rest of the GOP is telling them to shut the hell up because they known they need some minority votes to win in the future.

On the other hand, that wing of the party really is the Republican Id. Others in the party share those sentiments they just are too smart to express them openly.

 Barney is a future version of Nelson who stole Professor Frink's time machine and returned to the present to warn his childhood self against becoming an alcoholic.

 Possibly. I know they had at least one event at the Nuwabian compound, a barbeque or something. I'm no expert on the subject, I just know there is some kind of link. The wikipedia article lists a ton of other acts that were associated with the Nuwabians, most of which were a surprise to me. It seems like Scientology they make an effort to recruit celebrities into the ranks. 




 True. They are about the same level of dangerous. I'd give the edge to NOI though -  they have political influence in several cities including Philly and Oakland. I don't know of any city council members going to speak at Scientology centers. 




 The NOI teaches that the Earth and Moon were once the same

That's a very common occult/fringe religion belief. I have no idea where it originated (medieval alchemy, maybe?) but it shows up all over the the place. 




 That's the only thing you found that was weird? 




 The rappers OutKast are/were loosely associated with the Nuwabians, though I don't think they are official members. 

You can see references to Nuwabian beliefs in the videos for [ATLiens] (http://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-18086078/outkast_atliens_official_music_video/) - ancient Egypt - and [Elevators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptPj6K_jJQ) - blacks coming from/returning to another planet.

 Nooo, I meant the equivalence of the Halting Problem and Goldbach has not been proven. I repeated it in the hopes that someone would be familiar with the issue. 




 I'm not saying that's correct, just that someone had mentioned it. I guess you could think of checking each even number as a yes/no question? Not sure what the basis for the comment was, I don't think the poster ever elaborated. 




 Now *that* would be a supremely interesting number - the first number that is not a sum of two primes... 




 Does group theory help at all with these kinds of problems? I don't know much about Goldbach - though I once read a comment here that in the opinion of many it is equivalent to the Halting Problem and thus unsolvable (though this hasn't been proven either.) 




 A shame I think, no?

Did anyone else read this in a Russian accent? 




 United Airlines was union-owned for a while. Unfortunately, it was a bunch of *different* unions and they fought amongst themselves more than they had fought the previous ownership.

Unions don't necessarily represent the pure working class. There are middle-class unions and even business-owner unions. In countries like Venezuela some unions are conservative and oppose the Socialist government. In Poland the trade union Solidarity was a big part in bringing down the Communist government.

This is part of why Communists such as Lenin are not necessarily big fans of unions. Lenin criticized "trade union consciousness" as just another form of bourgeois thinking. 









 Public funding was cut drastically at the state and local level. The federal cuts are coming, especially if Romney wins. 









 Bull. They didn't "get it wrong," they did what they always do: Protect the banks, socialize their losses, cut public spending, privatize public assets, and then say "oops" when economies collapse and promise to do it better next time.

 But Spongebob is also incredibly friendly and warm to people, a trait not characteristic to autistic people.

That varies. Some autistic children are actually overly friendly, want to talk with strangers   trust them instantly. 




 That is correct, but political decisions are taken on the basis of GDP being a good measure of economic value, that is the problem. 




 And if you're looking to measure the value of open source software its contribution to GDP is just about the least exact measure.

I think that was his point, that economics needs to broaden its definition of value beyond GDP.

Someone who walks or bikes somewhere instead of drives is at least preserving value (if not creating it), by reserving the gasoline for someone who may have no choice but to drive (a disabled person, for example.)

 What do I not understand about Adlai Stevenson?

The "yellow dog" Democrats at the time - mainly southerners who would rather vote for a "yellow dog" than a Republican. Stevenson was pretty "yellow" in their eyes - he was a northern intellectual, but they voted for him anyway because of the D by his name.  




 Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist...

That's oversimplified. As a younger man he did think that the "characters" of the races were too different from one another for them to live together in peace, and the best solution was for the slaves to be freed and emigrate to a climate more suited to their culture, like the Caribbean. I think he mentioned Haiti as an example of a successful black Republic being formed in that region.

Also, that was the Lincoln of 1845. The Lincoln of 1865 had come to see the long view of history, and supported not only emancipation but voting rights and the right to hold public office for blacks who owned property or who had served in the military - which is what got him shot by Booth.  




 Any source on those Johnson quotes?  




 Even if so, it would be interesting. The movement seems to be falling apart right now, with so many high-level defections and even heretical offshoots appearing that claim to be the original Hubbardism! There are even rumors Cruise is leaving. 




 I should specify: Not a leader or a PR person, just an ordinary member, preferably one who's been in the organization a number of years and spent a good deal of money on the courses. 




 If I remember correctly, Bush campaigned on letting younger people opt out of the system altogether, and letting everyone, even those already retired, put their money in 401(k)-style accounts that they could choose to place with mutual fund companies like Fidelity. This is why Gore kept hounding him on the "lockbox" that he was so mocked for. As for the actual bill that got introduced, I don't know if it was that radical in its final version.

At least as it has been reported in the media, Ryan's plan involves replacing Medicare with $6000 vouchers (the per-person cap) with which people could buy private insurance. The government would still subsidize insurance for the elderly, but would no longer guarantee it. Again, this would be phased in, with people over 55 allowed to stay in "traditional" Medicare. 




  Even Ron Paul's budget preserved SS and medicare. 

It envisioned phasing them out, as does Paul Ryan's budget, at least for Medicare, and Bush II tried to privatize SS. I don't think there's as much of a gap between the old and the new Right as you think - they're still fighting the New Deal. 




 how is the modern right progressive? Because it supports foreign interventions? Other than that I don't see too much difference ideologically between the "old" and "new" right.  




 well McCarthy went down in flames once he started questioning Eisenhower and the Army, but it launched Nixon's political career, and Bobby Kennedy's, though the right-wingness of either of them later in their lives is debatable to say the least.

To ask a a follow-up question, how in the world did Trotskyists gain positions of power in the local unions to begin with? Your typical American union would laugh them out of the hall, unless they felt like beating them to a pulp instead. Were/are things different in the UK? 




 I never understood why the leadership tolerated the Trotskyites in the Labor Party at all. In the US, where you can join a party automatically when you renew your driver's license, it's hard to keep figures like David Duke or Pat Buchanan out,  but I always thought party membership in the UK was more tightly controlled.

 I agree, to me there's no difference between the two belief systems, but the fact that the Mormons aren't in the majority but are trying to "fit in" these days make them downplay these doctrines, and plus, as I just demonstrated, it's real real easy to make them sound like a UFO cult. I'm surprised South Park hasn't done them yet. 




 It used to be better known, but the LDS today downplays these teachings in an attempt to be more "mainstream" (mainstream as defined by religious right - Republican, etc.)

 I combined my responses to your two messages here. In case I got too wordy for you I put the **TL;DR** main points of my argument in bold.

.


Holding a belief, just because famous people held, is in general poor form. It is no defense for that belief.

As a non-expert, I am unfortunately reliant on the opinions of these "famous people." Alas, these vary greatly, from transcendentalists like Gdel to straight materialists like Krauss, and every shade in between, so I attempt to find among their views those that seem the most consistent, and which accord most closely with my own phenomenological experience. I admit the possibility that I have failed in this task.

.

 don't know any experts (I.e people who study consciousness and have a grasp of quantum mechanics... Note these are very few) that hold your view. 

Who are some people you know whom you feel have a grasp of both cogsci and QM? I would be interested to read the opinions of these dual experts. Penrose I think comes closest, but you're obviously not a fan.

You are quite right that the debate has mainly been a few adventuresome QM experts saying their field has implications for consciousness, and neuroscientists disagreeing with them (although *philosophers of mind* are sometimes a different story, and are occasionally more receptive to the views of these physicists.)

.


A notorious example is David Bohm and his holonomic brain theory. 

I am not a fan of Bohm. I don't even think his ideas are even coherent, let alone correct.  That the lenses in our eyes somehow keep us from seeing the holographic universe? It sounds like the ravings of a schizophrenic...

.

 In general, there is nothing wrong with being a dualist

Ugh, I disagree. Trying to formulate one fundamental ontology for existence is difficult enough, let alone two. I am not a dualist, at least not in the "two original substances, matter and mind" sense of the word. I don't think you can be a dualist without ultimately falling into the absurdities of Descartes and/or Leibniz. I do think though that a non-formal element is entailed by the existence of the physical world (see below.)

.

How would quantum computing be anti-formalist? How do you think we study quantum computing? It is an extremely formal field.


**I will address QM in general here, as I get to its computing aspect below: QM is extremely formal, perhaps the most formal theory ever devised, but precisely in being so it "heightens the contradictions" of formalism. It resorts to such things as negative probabilities, objects that are both waves and particles at the same time, and, as I learned from your article link, probabilities that don't add up to 1 and that violate the sure-thing principle.**

**This sort of thing, to me, points to the fact that we are trying to study a non-formal aspect of reality with formalist tools, and, however successful the mathematics has been, at root logical incoherence is the result. I will perhaps further irritate you and name-drop the ultimate famous person here and say the Einstein had similar criticisms of the ultimate logical validity of QM.**

.


To me it sounds that by non-formalist, you mean non-physicalist.

Not exactly. My philosophy is closer to people like Tarski and Gdel who wrote on the limitations of formal logic. I would consider them to be anti-Formalists under my definition, though usually this term is not applied to them by historians of philosophy (they reserve it for woolier figures like William James...). 

[And before you say Gdel wasn't a physicalist, I would disagree. To me Platonists are the ultimate physicalists. I won't elaborate more here as we'd go down a very long side-path.]

.


I would also distinguish between a *non*-formalist (someone like Meillassoux who thinks the Universe is a "hyper-chaos" that only *appears* sensible) and an anti-formalist (someone like me who thinks that there is more to the Universe than formal processes.) 

.


For me the physical universe is very real, it is not just the dream of a butterfly or some such nonsense, but, by the very virtue of its being real, it contains a non-formal, though not necessarily non-physical, element, that is, something that can *never be explained* by a formal system. Note that this does not mean the element is mystical or supernatural in any way. 

.


**To me it is no coincidence that QM and consciousness both seem to produce a "decoherence" of logical discourse - it is very difficult to talk about either of them using ordinary logical principles, a sign that they both belong to the non-formal aspect of reality. Do they share any connection beyond a connection of type? My intuition is that they do - and that the vast computing power promised by Quantum Computing and the vast apprehensive ability possessed by consciousness are signs of this link.**

.


Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.

Where do I get these weird ideas? Well, I see an unnamed but important line of thought in philosophy passing from Hegel to the post-Incompleteness generation of mathematicians, and then through figures like Heidegger and Lacan to modern thinkers such as Badiou (though I don't share the latter's politics.) I've come to think of this as the "anti-Formalist" line of thought, though that's my own term for it, nothing official. If you are not familiar with any of these writers, they hold that each entity contains a gap, a "not-all" within itself that not only allows for but *insists* that something radically "Other" must emerge from within.

.


So yes, I've outed myself as one of those damn Continental-philosophy fanboys, the kind of dupe who you probably think would have been fooled by the Sokal Hoax had I not been in grade school at the time. Do with me as you will!

.


Their ideas on consciousness were very naive and motivated not by a psychological problem but by the physics/philosophy problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. 

I am interested on your views on the measurement problem. Do you think it can be resolved (or dissolved as Wittgenstein would say) without a reference to consciousness, either on a human or a cosmic level? If so, how? [You might be interested in this article](http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/print/138). It is close to my views though I wouldn't use the term "God" as it's too historically freighted.

.


The reason I would like to see this is because I'd've never seen an intelligent defense of quantum mysticism and I would really like to see one. 

You won't get one from me - I'm not a quantum mystic, at least if by that you mean the belief that, say, entanglement means people can have psychic powers, or things of that sort. I am open-minded towards the paranormal, though not a believer. I like to say I don't want to be so open-minded that my brain falls out!


 




 Interesting links, I will check them out. I'd heard of the first idea but not the second. 

I am not an expert in these fields, but my opinion is not just "empty statements," as it is informed by and resembles that of some people who are experts. If I'm going to expend the time conversing with you I do expect some civility on your part. 




 I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.

You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true. 

You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.

Fundamentally I am an "anti-Formalist" when it comes to consciousness, meaning I think that somehow (whether through QM or Platonic Forms, or some other mechanism), consciousness exists at least in part outside the formal, "billiard-ball" world of classical physics.

Oh, and the fact is I have read what you've read, we just disagree. I don't claim to be an expert, but when the experts disagree, the layman is allowed his opinion.

 




 Well, to Penrose you would also have to add the even more formidable name of Schrdinger, who theorized on this issue in his "What is Life?" 

As for Gdel I guess this will get me in an even deeper hole with you, but I do indeed think there is a link between the Incompleteness Theorems (there's more than one) and consciousness as well. Of course, Gdel himself believed this, but then, Gdel wasn't a brain scientist and he went crazy, etc. etc. (You can tell I've had this argument before.)

Anyway. I'm not saying microtubules are what links QM effects to consciousness, it could be some other mechanism. Recently some solid links between QM and biology have been found, for example [in the navigational systems of birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3725). It's not consciousness - yet - but it does show a link between the biological and quantum worlds. 

I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive. 




 I have not read much technical literature and I realize popular articles on the subject can be sensationalistic or misinformed. However I still think there **might** be a connection between quantum states and consciousness, and there are some well-informed experts (Penrose, for example) who believe so as well. Do I have definite proof? No - that's why I used the word "believe" instead of "know" or "can prove."

 




 Haha, very civil reply. Anyway, ignoring your nastiness, my hypothesis is that the ability to process information and yet be in observation of the same process simultaneously, which seems to be an ability of human consciousness, might also be a characteristic of these sorts of computers. If quantum computers are possible, being able to calculate in super-position states might grant them this ability. 




 Are any of those episodes online? I stopped listening to C2C once it got so political but I'd love to hear Dr. Taff interviewed.

 It wasn't him, it was one of his followers. According to legend, the follower was killed for his discovery since it went against the Pythagorean belief in the sanctity of whole-number ratios.

According to another, more cool legend, the follower was killed not because he made the discovery but because he *talked about it publicly*, revealing esoteric knowledge that was only meant for the Pythagorean elite.

In addition to being mathematicians, the Pythagoreans were also a religious cult. Imagine a cross between the MIT Pure Math faculty and Scientology. 




 See [here](http://www.mpg.de/5925490/meta-consciousness-brain) 




 Chalmers sees consciousness as a Cartesian theater when he talks about consciousness is "presented" to him, as if he were a member of the audience watching his senses take the stage. He questions why processes are "accompanied" by experience, as if experience is an extra effort of theatricality for his enjoyment.

But isn't this exactly the case? That the conscious perception of a color is somehow different from say, how a computer would analyze visual wavelengths seems undeniable. Do you believe that a computer sees the color blue just as you do, that it has the same experience? I don't.

This element of theatricality, of presentation, is *precisely* the hard problem. Even if it is an illusion, it seems that this illusion could not arise except from a *prior ground of theatricality* that already exists!

Where I might differ from the Clarmers position is I think computers, probably quantum computers, will someday begin to have these presentations. That will be quite the interesting day. 









 Bad statistics... the US is coming off a much higher base of education than most of these other countries. Percentage growth in this sort of context *must* level out over time (you can't have more than 100% of people getting higher degrees than their parents).

Eh, not really. Almost all teachers, myself included, will give a lot of breaks and extra help to kids we know are having trouble at home.  




 Haha well I am the young guard - believe me most locals are looking for people. I agree about the PR. 




 A student can choose how much to study and how much to pay attention in class. A teacher cannot choose his or her students or force them to study. That is the difference. 




 From my experience most union locals are desperate for people to fill executive positions and often have to beg people to run. Yes it's more work but you can't complain if you don't get involved. 




 That's funny, the gist of the article was exactly the opposite, that MWI is the only thing that can save physicalism. What is your thinking on that argument? 









 Israel is held to a different standard because it came into existence as a *modern* Western-supported state, and, in part because of the pressure of modern Western morality, it didn't kick out or kill *all* of the people in the conquered land, though it did plenty of killing, don't kid yourself.

Had Israel been established and expanded in the 19th Century, like the US, and killed, ghettoized or expelled most of the Arabs, as the US did with the Indians, there would be no big debate.

That being said, the rich Arab oil states could easily pay to resettle the Palestinians - say in the Hejaz - but have chosen not to as that would be "giving in" to Israel . The Palestinians I have a lot of sympathy for. Both Israel and their Arab adversaries, though, not so much.

 Lee repeats the story himself, but I don't know of any independent confirmation. It sounds like the sort of grandiose story he would tell about himself. 




 They didn't think much of Japan militarily. It was a huge shock when Singapore fell. The British Navy removed a lot of fleet elements from Asia to reinforce the homeland. This might have been necessary, but they also didn't think it would be that big of a deal and that the forces they left behind would easily defeat the Japanese.

When the British blew the bridges into Singapore, legend has it that a man asked the future leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, what the sound was.

Lee replied: "That's the sound of the end of the British Empire." 




 I doubt he was. Usually however there was a picture of his invention with a black slave working with it. This is how this misconception got started. I believed it in elementary school too. 




 Actually it does, it's more malleable and platable than most other metals. And many people prefer how it looks to silver and platinum. That doesn't necessarily translation to monetary value though, platinum has often traded higher than gold per ounce. 




 Talk about stuff people were taught wrong in school... the gold standard had not been honored domestically since FDR. Only foreign drawers were allowed to exchange Federal Reserve notes for gold into the 70's, and this was only because basically no one did. 

When the French and Swiss governments decided to express displeasure with Nixon's inflationary policy and redeem all their notes for gold, Nixon and the Fed said "screw you" and closed the international gold window as well. 

It had nothing to do with economic growth and insufficient amounts of gold being dug up.

 Britain was already fighting in both wars, I don't think this holds up. 




 No, in most states further education is a state requirement, often at your own expense. Imagine continuing to pay for college classes or pile on more debt while making $30K per year.

You do get a pay raise for attaining higher degrees, but it's often not enough to make up for the additional cost of classes, and because you're trying to cram in summer and weekend courses, it can often take 10+ years to get a further degree.
 




 In my opinion the content knowledge is usually easier to acquire than the teaching skills. It's ironic that it's very hard to teach people how to teach, even though in aggregate it's just a bunch of simple skills and habits. 




 Are you... the *Amish Avenger* ?? 









 1.) Student loans are unconstitutional

2.) Hitler did stuff that was unconstitutional

3.) Hitler like, created the Holocaust

4.) Hitler was, like, German

5.) Lots of Germans live in the United States

6.) 2+3+4+5 = student loans will cause a second holocaust

 









 year of life? 




 I have always been a fan of the "Yoda was in on it" theory - he knew what was going to happen, but let it take place because the Jedi Order and the Republic had become too corrupt and complacent.

I have been banned from speaking of this theory within my Yoda-loving household... but I still have my doubts about our little green friend.  




 The party should bring back the old slogan from the FDR days: "If you want to live like a Republican, vote for the Democrat." 









 some of his contemporaries held the materialist position we now associate with modernism, and the Buddha explicitly rejected it. 

I still think it's fascinating that there were materialist-atheists in 400 BC. One would be inclined to assume that these were just "strawman" positions people pinned on their opponents, but no, we actually have texts from these groups! Similar ideas show up in Greece not too long afterwards. 









 Hm, yeah that is strange. Were there any substances imbibed at this festival? 









 That's not too impressive. A lot of HR departments use the same set of tests on prospective hires. I took the same stupid computer psychology test at least five times. 




 The new age, pseudo spiritualism that is often saddled on it.

Do you distinguish that from traditional belief in the Siddhis, or is it all superstitious accretion to you?

I'm ambivalent - some mediators I respect have claimed supernatural experiences, but I can't bring myself to totally buy it. It's easy to enter into a dreamlike state when you're in meditation. I've yet to see anyone levitate, in other words, and that Discovery Channel "documentary" doesn't count. 




 Sort of... but to a materialist suicide is annihilation, whereas the idea that Nirvana is annihilation is classified as a wrong view.

Suicide = Nirvana in the absence of rebirth is a false implication. 




 The final goal of Buddhism is Nirvana which only makes sense as opposed to Samsara which is the circle of perpetual birth-and-death. 

What about the view that Nirvana and Samsara are just different attitudes or reactions towards the same reality? Hippie talk and not real Buddhism, some say. I'm not so sure.

In fact, Nirvana is absolute bliss, and is not like nothingness or blackness at all. 

But bliss is still a sensation, and Nirvana is supposed to be super-sensate. Not trying to split hairs but I think it's an important distinction.

 




 I'm not sure about the first picture, but the second looks pretty accurate.
