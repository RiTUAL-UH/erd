 I want a picture of Slurms McKenzie from Futurama for my Facebook cover photo but unfortunately there aren't many available via Google Image Search. Would love any and all interpretations https://www.google.com/search?q=slurms+mckenzie um=1 ie=UTF-8 hl=en tbm=isch source=og sa=N tab=wi ei=IG_9UYPiE-P-igKjwYDIAQ biw=1366 bih=667 sei=I2_9UbP_Fu7jigL4_IDgDw 




 What is your end goal? Recent grad here. I found that the CAS degree was much more flexible (in terms of schedule and content) and honestly, unless you're trying to work at a snobby i-bank, top employers hiring for many business positions really don't care if you went to b-school or not. 

Source: I currently work at a Fortune 50 company with a CAS Econ degree. Hires here came from all sorts of schools and backgrounds, including arts programs, for finance/supply chain/ and marketing roles. 




 its the E3 update we deserve, but not the one we need right now 









 I know for a fact that he lives on St. Marks and Ave A. He goes out on that street ALL of the time. I have seen so many pics with him and talked to him a few times over beers and crepes.
