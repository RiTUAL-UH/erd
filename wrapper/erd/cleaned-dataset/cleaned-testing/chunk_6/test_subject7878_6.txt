 Yeah--it's called being in a state that requires a balanced-budget.  Cuts have to be made somewhere.

LSU charges too much for tuition anyway.  They aren't worth $38k a year. 




 Aw, beat me to it. 




 She wrote "bc"? Really? Just freaking write it out! 









 [Baby Bear from Sesame Street](http://www.sesamestreet.org/muppets/baby-bear). 




 ...except not at all. 




 Did you mean woman?  I only saw one.

Did her fuel line rupture or something? 




 Awesome movie was awesome. 




 ...wait--why isn't his mouth sewn shut?  *((hehehehehe))* 




 This, in my opinion, was the beginning of the downfall of America.

EDIT: "career" was probably a better word-choice than "profession".  C'est-la vie. 




 So odd-looking! 




 Yep--too wide for staples... maybe. 




 Probably because the term "scooby snacks" is [trademarked by Hanna-Barbera](https://trademarks.justia.com/857/75/scooby-snacks-85775219.html). 




 Jesus!  What kind of sippy cups are they using--stainless steel?! 




 [This is why...](http://i.imgur.com/Lchxz4j.jpg) 




 Who were the 88 morons?

Ahh, here's the link: http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll224.xml 




 I agree.  Wendy's fries used to be awesome.  Then they went to the "natural-cut" crap, and they suck now. 




 *shit-tier 




 These (and the ones below) need to be in /r/dadinstincts or something. 




 Same here. 




 ...so... The Haunting 2 then? 




 Because they're sheeple.  Baaaa! 




 Holy crap, the GIF was funny, but your title made me laugh out loud (which doesn't happen often).

You win an upvote and one internet.  Spend it wisely. 




 Yes, he did.  His nose wouldn't have changed **THAT** much when he lost weight. 









 Which one?  Haha!

The Latin is a family motto I took for my own family:  "Faith and Family First" 




 It's also easier to play if you don't play in cinematic mode, numb-nuts. 




 Wow... thanks for this!  I'm putting this up on my office door.

Way to go Cap'!

I loved the quote from the movie, "There's only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like **that**!"

EDIT: See?  [I really DID put it up!](http://imgur.com/FTbho3z) 









 This is bad for them just as much as for Republicans. 




 Star Wars... all the way. 




 A-frickin'-men! 




 So, he joined the Night's Watch after high school?

No need to block his name--we know it's Samwell Tarly. 




 I used to love it as a kid and teenager.  After eating hamburgers that tasted great, going back to McDonald's burgers is a huge mistake. 




 Aside from their fries and nuggets (but only when either is cooked WELL and is fresh), **McDonald's** food is crap. 




 'Cept for the sword itself, this has a very Vikings-esque feel to it. 




 LOL @ "Get outwe closed!"

 Memories of being 16 and playing this game on N64.  Hahaha!

Kung Pow was my main character! 




 Why the hell did you wait long enough for them to look like THAT?! 




 Yadda-yadda-yadda... 




 Just speaking from experience.  I live in Baton Rouge, LA, and we have a large black population in and around my city. 




 Entitlement isn't race specific though.

All of USA is in an entitlement mindset.  Especially this current youth generation that thinks everything should be given to them without earning it.  My 15yo daughter drives me insane. 




 Why can't I make sweeping statements when, as a white person, I'm automatically labelled as racist? 









 Well, hope she enjoyed her job, because she won't have one ever again. 




 Man, I was a gamer when MK1 came out, and I loved the game. I had a hard time watching some of those. This generation has become insanely desensitized.  




 "Oh, only 120 calories? Yay!"

The brand is hoping they don't look at the serving size. 




 Why is this so hard to find?  The workers at most fast food places here suck.  




 I don't know that I have a true favorite. My musical tastes are pretty eclectic, so I like a lot of different bands. 




 It was funny, but the Obama one is what originally made me subscribe. 




 Threatening the safety and lives of my wife and/children.  I'd do it with my bare hands if I had to. 




 Jason Mraz was awesome.

Bela Fleck and the Flecktones live music is WAY better than the studio versions. 




 I couldn't care less about Trader Joes really. If it's more expensive than Walmart or Sam's Club, I don't go there. 

B.R. thinks NOLA-ans are yats, and Lafayette is filled with coonasses. ;-) 




 Run into the street in front of a car, stop dead in my tracks, run back and forth a few times to confuse the driver, and then squeeze out between their tires at the last second. 




 Baton Rouge native here. Never heard of the band, song, or show. 




 The Green Flantern makes a killer lime-flavored dessert. 




 Yeah, I've seen him talk in an interview. It was kind of tongue-in-cheek anyway. Hehe! 




 I thought, "Wait--why does Beard Man need a mic.... OMG, HE WAS SINGING!" 




 This is great! Praying for you! 




 Indeed.  I love that scene! 




 This movie contained my favorite quote about alien life:

"If it ***is*** just us... seems like an awful waste of space." 




 This was a joke, not serious... haha! 




 The first one. 




 I was under impression they said ["...wow..."]( https://youtu.be/LJ0sDES7Dpc) 




 Yeah--there's no musical numbers at all (excluding the new Jabba's Palace scene Lucas put in the SE). 




 I'm actually going back and "re-reading" these on Audible.

Just started #3 - The Dragon Reborn, and I'm loving it.  I listen to it anytime I do my walking, or if I'm in the car by myself.  Love it. 




 Whether the toxins could be removed "pharmaceutically" remains to be seen. 




 I gave up smoking... I only miss it when I get extremely stressed out. 









 /u/VeteranRook, I'm a 13-year convert raised Assemblies of God.  I had the same issue; it was my only and last hang-up.

It was described very well by /u/chan_kohaku.  I just wanted to let you know you weren't alone in questioning this. 




 It needs [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytCEuuW2_A) played on it. 




 I think it too.  Every time. 




 "HA!  Got 'em!  Ha!  Got 'em! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

 It would be awkward to admit to a spouse that one has this problem, but he/she would be the best choice for accountability.  




 Hated that damn thing! 




 Some fries, mother-fucker 














 Looks like a villain from Darkwing Duck. 




 WOW!  You're absolutely correct! 




 I am the only one in my family that likes the following:

1. Green Peas
2. Field Peas
3. Crowder Peas
4. Lima Beans 




 Of course not. 




 **YouTube** ... That's about it. 




 That's what I was thinking.

I'm thinking this caretaker is a zoophile. 




 There was no other way than LICKING?  Seriously? 




 That went the complete opposite direction I thought it would. 




 Pursuit Of Happiness 




 Mechanical. 

I work as an electrical designer (under an engineer) and we do commercial design work for architects. We deal with several disciplines. The mechanical subs appear to always get their units and spec data directly from a manufacturer instead of doing it themselves.

Not to mention they get us the electrical data the day before the job is due. HVAC is a HUGE percentage of electrical load. We do most of the actual engineering right at the end. 




 Because feminism has turned into belittling men to raise women.

They want nothing to with equallity. They won't stop until all men are cowed under the dominant female sex. 




 I utilize technical writing on a daily basis for work (I am an electrical designer for commercial buildings).  We use the Oxford (or "Serial") comma so as to not create confusion or ambiguity. 




 Good point. 




 Why only low-income kids?  This is America where all are equal.

Either free e-books for all or none. 




 What the hell did I just watch...? 




 I agree with /u/Sixteen_Million. 




 That last part would be a great dynamic to the game.  I wouldn't bother with the healing/damage.  That would get annoying to play with.  The interacting with specific colors however, adds a depth to the strategy that is pretty cool. 




 Are the wireframe sections strictly for aesthetics, or do they react differently than the rest of the structure? 




 Well, that was downright adorable. 




 This!  Interdimensional beings don't belong in the Star Wars universe. What the hell was Vonda N. McIntyre thinking?!  At least this was her only Star Wars novel--let her stick to her Star Trek novels. 




 This is one of the main reasons why I don't do multiplayer on any game.  Ever.  That and the prepubescent boys who think cussing like a sailor makes them more manly. 




 Why should he have been?  Most people don't have input in their replacements.  It's the company's decision. 




 1. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D
2. The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds
3. Mario Kart 7
4. Super Mario 3D Land
5. Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS
6. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D
7. Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D
8. Paper Mario: Sticker Star
9. Star Fox 64 3D 




 The captions... hahahaha! 




 143?! Wow! We had 2 new ones fully come through RCIA this year. 




 ***[Insert Everyone's Personal Channel Here]***

There.  I saved a lot of time. 




 Guarantee you the driver of the SUV was on his/her phone, looked up, saw the bus stopped, swerved to miss, and almost hit the 3 kids in the process.

GET OFF YOUR PHONES PEOPLE! 




 Yep!  That's my point.

What my iTeen has to do to get a ringtone on her phone compared to me is about 5-10 minute difference. 




 My daughter wanted ringtones, she had to put through iTunes before she could put it on her iPhone.

iThinkAppleSucks 




 [I see what you did there...](http://i.imgur.com/I6BMkaI.gif) 




 That technology and expertise costs a LOT of money and uses a lot of time that could go towards hiring people to just clean up the streets.  Damn. 




 So, what you meant to put was "SUSPECTED Story in comments". 









 Congrats on the soon-to-be baby then! 




 I tell my 15yo iTeen the same thing. 




 Andoid has the same thing, it's called any PC anywhere... not the iTunes program on the one computer you have linked to it. 




 Ah, yes, I think I remember seeing that picture of "Empty Server List" or something.  You were the soon-to-be father? 




 He's 4yo now, and still does this if you start the chant.  Haha!
