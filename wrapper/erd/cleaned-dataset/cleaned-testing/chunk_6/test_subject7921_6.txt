 Well I must be like......bottom of the barrel instead of close to average.

The idea of asking a woman out scares the piss out of me, not because women are scary....it's because they can be pretty nonchalant or callous about it and it starts to add up after awhile for me.

And if one approached me, I'd figure it was a prank being played on me or someone setting me up to harvest me for organs.

It's gotten to the point where a woman being a little more than just friendly with me makes me start to have feelings for her.  And this is exactly what everyone is always saying is being a creep, because her being nice doesnt mean she's interested.  

So her being nice doesnt mean she's interested.  And her being anything else doesnt mean she's interested.   So......die alone.
 




 Even though I have no children, no wife, etc.  A lot of what you said here really hits some points I've been noticing lately with myself.

You are very lucky to have your husband to talk to about these things.   No one I know (not getting paid for it at least) wants to hear these things, and it's just horrible in both counts to not have anyone....and trying to confide and seeing they don't get it or don't want to hear these things.  It's........like a weight you can't put down and only gets heavier each time you are denied the ability to talk about it for me.  Made myself cry saying this.
 




 Do YOU think you're crying and anxiety is a problem?  If you do, then you should probably try to deal with it through therapy or something as your parents aren't going to be sympathetic to you judging on the comment.

If you don't think it's a problem, then do what you gotta do then file whatever they say under "Shit my parents said that doesnt help".


I have anxiety, small stuff bugs the hell out of me.  I don't feel like people relate to it, which is why I see a therapist to put things in some perspective I guess.  You have to figure your parents have went through school, having kid(s), etc and other things to give them a potentially "higher" baseline for stuff to get anxious over.

Although it doesnt mean they didn't worry about shit when they were younger, they just can't relate to their younger selves anymore.

And I'll say that the pressure NOW versus 20-30 years ago on people trying to find their way is much higher.  Things are more blown out of proportions because of social media and the sheer amount of bullshit you see on a daily basis that seems important.  You rarely see all the bad shit in people's facebook feeds, makes it seem like you righteously pissed off some divine being who wants to make your life a living hell in comparison.

 




 Well I think in the end it's going to come back to you.  If you think you can tough out a year or two at a place at the higher pay....you could always try to negotiate higher pay at your existing job once you have an offer on the table from one of the others.  Though people will often counsel that you run the risk of making your job insecure by doing that.

It's unfortunately the only way to apparently get pay raises that aren't cost of living the majority of the time.  Got a friend looking at doing something very similar now because he's under paid, but really likes his job.  Although he has some concerns about it a year or two out.
 




 I think you make a point on most.  But I don't think you can say with any confidence that you have job security or not based on what you've stated.

Lower end of the pay scale could also mean you're doing the stuff no one else being paid more wants to take the time to do for now.  Or that your company doesn't value your skill sets as much as they should......etc.

I PERSONALLY think that MANY managers/companies think that "newer" is better.  It's a game where they like to take their competitions workers as often as they can and they end up feeling like they have the best people simply because they stole someone away.

And often because of this weird logic they get into, people "hop" away from a company they like, to get the pay they deserve, to hop back to the company they like so they can be there and get the money they deserve as well.  I think it's stupid as hell that you have to think like that, but it seems to be the way things are right now.

Make sure your job title is "more impressive" if you move, plan on working there for 1-3 years depending on some factors...like if nothing changes for 2 years...you got a reason to leave "it got stale".  But if in a year they are being bought out, you move for "job security"...etc.

If you like where you work and are happy, that has a lot of weight to it.  But getting into a higher pay tier might make you "happier" in other ways....house sooner, kids on the way.......new car......retire sooner.

And only you can answer what that extra pay means to you, whether you do or don't switch.  Exploit anything your company has for furthering your education/degree/training reimbursements, etc.  Since staying might make them take another look at your "ambition" outside of work, and if you switch..and are afraid of job security...knowing more never hurt too much.
 




 Think it's more about having a "something has your back" reason for hope.  Than more of a religious conversion in your case probably.

My therapist basically made it known he's a Christian, which I was raised that way but I loathe organized religions.....some of the worst people  (even family members) I've ever met use them like a shroud to do bad shit.

In the case of my therapist and myself, I don't think he'd try to convert someone.  But he does use his religion as an example as to how he comes to peace with things that have troubled him in the past.  He has basically said that if you identify as "X" he wants to make you the best X you can be.  Whether it be a religion, trans-sexual, whatever you want to identify as.

So........ you might consider that before you throw it away.  Since it's sometimes hard to find someone you have any kind of commonalities with sometime, and can be pretty frustrating to try to make them understand your approach or way of thinking sometimes....to the point where you spend more time trying to make them understand something than actually moving on.

 




 They have to report it if you have credible plans to hurt yourself or others.  You can ask the therapist to explain it and say "it's not something I plan on doing, but ..."

So.......IMO it's important to talk about because they are going to have better records/memory of your conversations than you will since HOPEFULLY your mindset will change over time and thinking like you are now will be "alien" in a way....like how "normal" people can't understand how horrible it is when you try to describe depression/etc to them.
 




 Oh I've been out of college for awhile with my degree.  I had a couple CS-related jobs I hated with a passion and just gave up on the whole programming aspect after that.

I am currently toying with the idea of going back for a masters degree.  I hate to have a bachelors in CS that is essentially a waste of time and money, so would like to find something that builds on it but doesn't lend itself so easily to being "taken advantage of"/"Abused" in the working world.

Really think schools should take more time to help people better evaluate what the reality of their degree looks like when they finish. 




 I will say I don't feel I've been successful as a CS major and lost interest/passion for it, which I am trying to recover slowly or find something that pushes the CS button but fulfills other criteria I've developed.

Like:  Solving puzzles and varying degrees of detail you can take towards an approach to the solution.

Dislike:  The corporate culture that says you have to learn all of the new things on your own time, pay for books/classes with your own dime, and yet not get paid/reimbursed for your efforts the majority of the time.

Another dislike:  Sometimes having no noticeable progression on a project/task and trying to deal with people who want constant and often unrealistic updates. 




 Did this problem come up after you did a BIOS install or anything in particular?

If so you could try a CMOS reset on the BIOS to see if it will undo the unwanted change.  I don't have the motherboard to look at the menu system, so just wondering how it got turned on.
 




 Talk to your doctor...I have it too.  You might need something else...like therapy to bridge the gap to normal.

Therapy takes awhile, but it's useful. 




 Hot. 




 36 year old guy and I'm lonely. I am white, brown hair, blue/green eyes, overweight (working on it), and am pretty inexperienced at dealing with women in general. I'm open-minded, like to hear about new things.....told I have a pleasant voice and that I'm intelligent.

I am looking for an ongoing conversation with a woman, let's say 20-35, light skinned, nice smile, medium/long hair. I'm into larger chested women, you being overweight is not an issue, I just like proportionality. In fact it really bothers me to find out there are so many good looking women who think they are nothing special roaming the planet. I don't lie when it comes to my opinion on looks, outfits, hair, etc.... Ideally I'd like to get a lot of pictures from you and you'd want my opinion on them, but really not necessary. The IMPORTANT part of this is that you WANT to talk and contribute to the conversations, or even kick off a days conversations if we've lapsed due to whatever. And if you are not interested in talking anymore, let me know so I'm not left wondering.

Interests:

Reading, mostly fantasy. Series include Dresden files, Stormlight Archives, Codex Alera, Mistborn, etc.

TV. Supernatural, Workaholics, Sleepy Hollow, Tosh, Grimm, lots of others

Movies. Behind on movies, but I like comedies and action probably the most.

Video Games. Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands, FPS and other type of games only game on PC.

I have a Computer Science degree, and am currently looking into options for going back for a masters in something to open up some job options...still doing my research. Was looking at jobs for longevity and growth, something like Healthcare, Financial, or possible network security types...so if you're in any of those in the tech side....would be interested in hearing about your experience with them. The generic descriptions on the web don't do much for me overall.

I have frequent depression, and some family experience with other mental health stuff if you would like to talk about those with someone with a little experience it.

Just be genuine, hold up your end of the conversation, and open up a little when appropriate and we'll get along fine. Like I said I really enjoy getting pictures from women, but no pressure there beyond an initial confirmation photo swap possibly.

I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video. And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first, maybe with a picture exchange to at least avoid catfish/troll scenarios.

PM me questions, kik name, etc. Can go from there. And if you read this post and it's old, chances are Im still looking. Guys on here don't get too many replies from these things.
 




 Grats to the guy, bagged him a catch. 




 You have such a pretty face and smile. 




 I've never been married or had kids.  But the rest of the stuff I can relate to.

People can sense the depression/self hatred/negativity that comes along with it.  Havent spoken to many of my friends in years.

I've been seeing a therapist for...........4-5 months now.  And I don't think I started feeling better until I finally felt like I could tell them everything and that was a couple months in.  It's not even telling them everything, it's having them be able to communicate that they see that you feel stuck.

The first thing is that you have to take the view that as long as you are trying and putting all the effort you can into your job hunt, addressing your issues, etc......that you aren't a failure.  Failure is when you quit, and I myself quit many things because of the depression.  Sounds easy when you write it out, it's TREMENDOUSLY hard.  

The therapist will probably tell you to keep a regular schedule, take a shower and change into clothes you would leave the house in...so you at least did that "normal" thing.  Eat regularly even if you aren't hungry.  Don't drink alcohol.  Take your medications, especially if you are on anti-depressants...but even your blood pressure/blood sugar can make your mood worse.  Also thyroid issues can cause depression, so if you have the potential for that you need to get it checked.


Personally I found talking to people to help, outside of therapy.  Lack of contact really makes you feel worthless on top of everything else.  Doesnt even necessarily have to be about the depression itself, just express the "loop"/"trap" you are in and see if they can see the best path forward or at least they say "Well you're doing everything you can, see your therapist, etc".  I personally don't think people can truly comprehend the self-hatred that comes with that deep depression unless they've had it.   And people pick up on it, I am 100% sure it bleeds through on job interviews especially if you really don't want that position as much as they'd like you to pretend you do.  


So, I say therapy, express what you've said here.  Get a therapist you like, if you don't like the first one you meet go to another.  If you don't want to talk to a man about it, get a woman, old vs young, etc.

Apply to interviews and go, just try to picture the best possible outcome.  Try not to let the negativity toward your skillset/self take over.  Maybe even work on that first with your therapist since everyone needs money.

Another thing I've been told:

Sex, chocolate, sunlight, exercise, and regular sleep help depression.  So chocolate up your husband and go screw outside somewhere after a nap possibly. :)
 




 Glad you stayed.  STILL wondering your age! heh
 




 Last two are good.

 She has an amazing body. 




 I contemplate it nearly everday, even on days where Im not especially depressed or have any reason to be upset more than normal.    I don't live any sort of perfect life, and I am trying to improve it.  But I think it stems from so many things being out of my control that struggling to improve and having essentially anyone else but me be able to decide when dreams get fulfilled in many circumstances becomes overwhelmingly daunting.

And it might be a bit of 'the grass is always greener' in that perhaps if there is a life after death, it'll be less shit and more enjoyment. 
 




 Beautiful boobs. 




 If you say "Im going to kill myself tonight", they are required by law to act.

If you say "I think about suicide often."  Then it can be discussed....

Be honest...... but before you go hog wild with the therapist, just see if you like them as a person.  You can always ask to see someone else if you dont think you'll get along with them.
