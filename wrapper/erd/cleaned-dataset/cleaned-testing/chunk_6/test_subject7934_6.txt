 Try reading that link sebko sent.  It's full of incoherent ranting. 




 I'm not asking to be taken seriously.  I'm asking for a cogent argument, but you haven't given one, seem to be offended by that, and now are calling me names.  Enough for me.  

Good luck with your "trades".  No doubt the government will step in to ensure the solvency of your industry when you geniuses blow up the world again.
 




  The entire reason the right came back in 2010 is because the left began to move, well, left. It was an almost Newtonian response to the agenda of the President.

I think the evidence says the opposite.   Democratic turnout is known to be low during non-Presidential elections, so there's that, but it doesn't account for the particularly low D turnout that year.  *That lack of enthusiasm* is the real story.  It's not that people turned against the Ds.  No one was for them anymore.  And in fact, in the South, it was the Blue Dogs who tacked right trying to placate conservatives who were most thoroughly wiped out.  That at least is something we have to be thankful for.  Good riddance to them and their malign impact on the party.

The fallacy of median voter theory is that there is a middle to appeal to.  There is not.  [The public is more divided than ever.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/ )  What does exist is a difference in enthusiasm.  Republicans with their constant irrational appeals to fear have a reliable strategy for turning out a dwindling base.  Democrats squander their natural advantage, constantly alienate theirs, and take their failures as reasons to move further right, even as public policy choices lie far to the left on issue after issue.

It's hard to find a one stop shop for data on this, but try googling around yourself.  Look for polls where Americans are assessed for their views on actual public policy issues, not on party preference. 

Here are some from the first page when googling "poll american public policy preferences":

* [This summary](http://theprogressivecynic.com/2014/05/02/is-the-usa-center-right-an-issue-by-issue-breakdown/ ) shows that on issue after issue, Americans are progressive.  

 * They want spending for entitlements and the poor over deficit reduction, left and right both want the wealth distribution to be more equal than it actually is, even as they both underestimate how unequal it actually is.  
 * They support increasing taxes on the wealthy by large margins.  
 * 71% support increasing the minimum wage.
 * vast majorities approve of labor unions
 * a plurality think we spend too much on defense
 * a decisive majority is positioned to the left on voting rights
 * a vast majority wants to legalize marijuana
 

The list goes on and on and.  You should read it.

Milquetoast Democrats like Mondale and Dukakis haven't been able to articulate the issues that public cares about because they've sliced and diced it into tiny issues.  Republicans have a simple marketing message based in fear, religion and nationalism.  Democrats could, but don't articulate what the public actually cares about: economic fairness.  They've followed clueless consultants like Bob Shrum right off the cliff.  

The fact is, that the Democrats have been on the defensive since they abandoned their post as the champions of economic justice.  Until they get back to their traditional stance, the contempt of the public for them and for government in general will only increase - and it will be well deserved. 




 How can I take this guy seriously?  Anyone who opens with a hot headed ad hominem attack is just begging for eyes to roll.

 Just what we need  another economist with ZERO real work experience. The latest economist destined to destroy the world in the same manner as Karl Marx is Thomas Piketty and his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century that is destined to perhaps kill more people than Marx ever did.

He follows with a  sequence of untestable claims and red baiting that seems like an audition for Fox rather than a serious critique.  This bit made me laugh (emphasis in the original):

  Piketty is only focused on the disparity between rich and poor. He too sees this as evil rather than trying to figure out **HOW** the economy functions. Piketty is off on a quest to control the world and place even more of our rights, privileges, and immunities into the hands of guess who - **government**! 

Sorry, but this essay is written for true believers.  It's not going to convince anyone else.  For example:

 Piketty claims the current level of rising wealth inequality imperils the very future of capitalism. He claims he has proved it with his book  *good one*! 

That is an argument?

And then he offers this sequence of non-sequitors in support:

 He totally fails to even comprehend **HOW** the global economy functions or that John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) in the end admitted his ideas were wrong and that he had hoped that Adam Smiths **Invisible Hand** would save Britain. Here is a picture of Keynes at Bretton Woods discussing how to save the world with government intervention speaking to Roosevelts **Henry Morgenthau, Jr.** (1891- 1967)  Secretary of the Treasury.


Sheesh.  Four paragraphs in and all I've got is apoplectic drivel.  I honestly can't waste my time going any further.  If you can summarize the argument and point to a chart, I'd be happy to look, but this writing is self-discrediting.  It's like the author is on a crusade to portray himself as a biased ideologue.  

Serious criticisms, please.
 




 So does including that data invalidate his findings? And how so?  I'd like to see the analysis.  

I'd love to hear some substantial criticisms, but  glib responses only serve to make me skeptical of the anti-Piketty crowd. 




 USA #1,  folks! 




 Link? 




 The Consulting by RPM review claims "the most obvious problem with Piketty's book is that he wants to make workers poorer, just so long as it will hurt rich capitalists even more."

Seriously?  The author's opinion about what the Piketty's motives are is "most obvious problem"?  The author have spent enough time sneering about progressives and invoking Marx to let us know they've got their ideological fur up.  That they lead with this as their top criticism certainly hints that there's no there there.  

Specifically, both Reisman and Consulting by RPM seem to completely ignore Piketty's main finding: that Capitalism in its normal state leads to a situation where inherited wealth accumulates more quickly than earned wealth, and that after a brief anomolous period, we are now going back to that.  This is the same situation that existed in fin de siecle France - classes became fixed, and merit was not rewarded.  When this is true, the road to wealth starts by being born into it, and it becomes difficult to impossible to change your economic standing through work.

To point to the cool toys that capitalism produces while overlooking the loss of class mobility as the ConsultingByRPM piece does, is not to different from  saying "let them eat cake".  

Finally, the "bombshell blunder" that they report from Chris Giles of FT has been thorough and humiliatingly debunked.  And finally, invoking the far out of mainstream and explicitly anti-empirical Austrians really lays the cards out for all to see. These guys are another bunch of unhappy Libertarian ideologues.  There have got to be better critiques than these. 




 I tried reading the Reisman blog. I couldn't understand whether his specific technical criticisms have merit or not.  He's obviously deeply opposed to Piketty ideologically - he complains about Piketty referencing Marx too much and von Mises, Rothbard et al. too little, for example. He is so hot headed, it's sometimes hard to tell whether there is a valid technical criticism or whether he's just objecting to the conclusions:

 The depths of Pikettys ignorance are such that he believes that capital accumulation not only does not raise real wages but reduces them, by allegedly increasing the share of national income that goes to profits and correspondingly reducing the share that goes to wages, while the overall total of what is produced remains unchanged or increases only very modestly, and then not by virtue of any contribution to production made by capital

He does provide a reference for this, but it's to a file on his local machine, not on the web, so it's impossible to validate. Honestly, it's so hard to get through paragraphs that are filled with this kind of name calling and so poorly supported.  If you're going to call someone an idiot, you better demonstrate this without any doubt, or you risk eroding your own credibility.  Why doesn't he show where Piketty makes the claims he says he does, so we can make up our own mind about it?  Why doesn't he show the mathematics and the specific results that demonstrate Piketty is wrong? Reisman just comes off as an unhappy ideologue.

 




 Ok, that's a start.

Median voter theory is conventional wisdom.  And the Democrats have accepted it without question -- and without test -- for 40 years.  As a result, they've fielded increasingly right wing candidates.  While they've  negotiated themselves to the right of Nixon, Republicans have steadily pushed the Overton window to the right.  

At the same time, these theories *completely* discount actual polling preferences of the American public for the middle.  Healthcare is a good example where poll after poll has shown overwhelming support for both  the public option and outright socialism in the form of universal care. 

Yet, we effectively have two right wing parties.  Is it a surprise that American's opinion of Congress is the lowest it has ever been?  How do the politics of one of America's most popular presidents ever (FDR) fit in today?  Had Republicans followed the median voter theory scolds, we would have a much more liberal country today.  Instead, Democats did, and rightist policies have won. 




 This is what a leader looks like, folks.  We need her or someone like her in 2016, not that carpetbagger from Arkansas.

 A huge problem with the Bond franchise is keeping it fresh.  Every iteration, you have to avoid it being a cookie cutter operation.  You're basically on the hook for delivering a similar set of tropes:  Go to HQ, chat with Money Penny, Meet with Q, Go on Mission, Meet Girl, Banter with Villain, Go to Villains Layer, Kill villain, Pan out while kissing the girl.  

People howled when blond, blue-eyed Craig was scheduled to take the lead.  The style of Casino Royale totally broke our expectations and shocked us a bit.  The style of Bond, brutal, blue eyed and *coarse* --- not a gentleman at all --- was unexpected, and woke us up.  It was a completely different kind of charisma that carried the show.  And that's why it worked, why it was the one of the best Bonds in decades.

A black bond, especially with an actor with Elba's presence,  opens up a whole new set of possibilities.  There's a whole new style and totally new kinds of interactions that can be explored.  What does it mean when the world's top secret agent is a black guy?  Totally different dynamic.  I'm dying to see what they do with this.   




  Hilary   the Left need to make these conciliatory gestures

To paraphrase one of our Presidents, there's smart conciliation and stupid conciliation.  Let's not do stupid conciliation.  We've had 6 years of that.

It's time for the left to start articulating a real vision.  Hillary's clearly stated goal is to co-opt enough of the left to win so she can continue executing hawkish and neoliberal policies.  Fuck that noise. 




 I.e., we are fucked. 




 She's signaling as clear as any Democrat ever can that she's going to slavishly follow Wall Street's commands.

 That is a dense paper.  How the WaPo author derived that claim is not obvious to me. 









 The full text I summarized:

 In perhaps the starkest illustration, economists from Harvard University and the University of Chicago wrote in a recent paper that every dollar a worker earns in a research field spills over to make the economy $5 better off. Every dollar a similar worker earns in finance comes with a drain, making the economy 60 cents worse off. 




 **Submission Statement**

Covers recent studies from economists at Harvard, U Chicago et al. on the damage over financialization is doing to our economy.  Instead of being a generalized lament, the article describes some specific measures that demonstrate the point.  For instance, unlike other fields, where technological advancement has led to a decrease in fees, in finance, the opposite has happened.   









 Finally a proper use of all caps.  Strunk   fucking White right here.

 I think describing her as a visionary on inequality only captures a narrow part of why she's important.  Ultimately, Warren is articulating the short-comings of Capitalism itself, and that, arguably is the most critical issue of all today.  In contrast, Gore's focus on climate change is merely narrow and technical, for instance.  Warren's broad critique of a system which is incorrectly calculating value, unfairly distributing resources and harm is an umbrella that includes almost all the other issues that are confronting us. 

Climate change, for example, is a problem of markets not taking into account externalities.  Even police brutality becomes part of the conversation because it is one side of the story of unequal application of justice --- Warren has pointed out how the budget of the rich peoples' police (i.e., Wall Street regulators) was cut, and has talked about how DoJ is viciously prosecuting drug crimes.  It's a short step to also talk about police brutality.  Campaign finance reform is another - rich people are bending the system to their will.  

Warren is tying all the big issues together through by articulating the critical flaw of neoliberalism, which has been the policy of Ds and Rs for the past 40 years.  A system which rewards ownership (by respecting only property rights) does the expected--- it doles out rewards to property owners and pain to the poor.  And that touches climate, justice, financial regulation, foreign policy (though I'm disturbed by her statements on Israel), education, health care and social security --- in short, the whole body of politics.

Democrats have been a slew of mumblers (and I include Gore, whom I have a lot of respect for) --- who've failed to articulate an over arching theme.  Yet, it's been so simple.  They've just been scared to go there because they all bought into the Washington wisdom that you have to unquestioningly worship markets to be "serious".  I think this is why, whether they know it or not, so many people now feel that Warren must be President. 









  That being said, is it justifiable to shut down the entire federal government in protest? Particularly if it comes from the Democratic party, I think that only further legitimates the notion that the government can and should be shuttered in a symbolic protest against a provision that the majority of Congress agrees with.

I resonated with Taibbi's fit of pique, and didn't think too deeply about this.  But your analysis is insightful and hard to disagree with.    The problem, clearly, is Obama and all Blue Dogs.  Perhaps the right action is for progressives to break ranks and start speaking in a clear independent voice, as Warren has.   




  I guess the question is: can Warren open that window back up?

I haven't seen a politician who is so *needed* in over a decade.  Gore was a terrible politician, but a visionary on key issues - internet and climate change.  Warren is a visionary on inequality and is appearing to be a formidable personality.  So, yes, I think there's hope. 




 But what's the point of that?  That's another open ended statement like the first that just throws vague cold water on Warren without adding anything actionable to the conversation.  *Of course* we should focus on actions, so what?  We should also brush our teeth.

And to respond to the specific point, speeches are how politics gets done, and particularly, how populist politics gets done.  Without speeches, all you have are a bunch of insiders doing back-room deals.  Excitement around populist positioning is what gives a politician power to push that position inside the back rooms --- for example in the DPCC, to which she was recently appointed.

Let's keep the discussion specific.  "Warren needs to do ___, ___ and ___.  She said ___, ___ and ___, but didn't do anything.  This is more of the same."  Would be a better starting point. 




 I.e., "Don't trust politicians!"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide_(language):

 A bromide is a phrase or platitude that, having been employed excessively, suggests insincerity or a lack of originality in the speaker

 




 I have friends who were fans of his.  One actually went to meet him at his office when he was in Congress a couple of years after his speech at Kerry's convention.  Obama wasn't really a household name at that time, obviously.  

I remember him being excited about some Senator who, he averred, was "onto something good".  The Obama bumper stickers soon followed.  I distinctly recall the sense of disappointment when I found out it was the "One America" speech guy.  That prattle was the toast of Washington, a tone deaf feel good paean that was blind to the radicalism emerging on the right, and which, idiotically, urged compromise.  In this way, his critics are right, he is like Chamberlain.

Obama has done real damage - not only are the inattentive (like ban-chali) now reflexively cynical and disillusioned, he shifted partisan Democratic politics rightward at a time when the country was ready for an FDR, and the base craved one.  In this way, he is not unlike the idol he repeatedly praised, Ronald Reagan.  While the Gipper nudged the American middle to the right, Obama led blind Democratic partisans off the cliff as they defended him on bailouts for banks, torpedoing the public option behind closed doors, whistle blower prosecutions, domestic spying, and lack of accountability for torture and war crimes.

The numb-skulls who were too dense to see the signals back in 2012 and now worry about Warren are only proving that cognitive deficits can manifest recurrently in fresh forms. 









 It's not an analogy - it's a parody.  The original argument is a sloppy bromide, suitable for a dive bar drunk, but now popular amongst jilted Obama supporters -  but they only have themselves to blame.  They were obtuse last time around, and they think wisdom is being obtuse in the opposite direction this time around.
 




 Anyone who thought Obama was a progressive in the primaries was seriously not paying attention.  

1. He voted for telecom immunity

2. He threw progressive Joe Lamont under the bus and supported Joe Lieberman

3. He explicitly said supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive

4. He repeatedly praised Reagan

5. His speech  at Kerry's DNC ("One America") was milquetoast idiocy that called for compromise and triangulation.  Honestly, progressives who got  excited about this nonsense deserved to be disappointed.


Let's try paying attention this time.

Obama != Warren.   




 Hitler also made speeches that got a lot of hype.  Therefore Warren is like Hitler too. 




 Meh - people laughed that at the idea  a black guy named Hussein could ever in a million years win the Presidency, especially after 9/11. 




 The lesson of Obama is look carefully at candidates' actions, not just their fine words.  I thought it was obvious in the primaries - Obama embraced Joe Lieberman and threw a great progressive, Joe Lamont, under the bus, then went on to support telecom immunity.  I didn't understand why no one wanted to talk about that back then.  

We need to take a very close look at candidates, and demand fighters.  Obama, to me, seemed terrible tone-deaf and the absolutely wrong choice even as early as his speech at Kerry's nominating convention.  There is not a Republican America and a Democratic America, there is one America, he told us.  This was delusional feel good nonsense for the progressives that bought in.  For those who were awake, it already hinted at his politics of triangulation, which is to say, someone whose strategy is to placate his supporters while rewarding them with right wing policies.

And now we have Mrs. "Hard Choices".  As a wise man once said, Fool me once... can't... get fooled again!
 




 I call bullshit.

Not only does that seem false - most liberals are pissed about Obama's anti-constitutional militarism and triangulating neoliberalism --  it is demonstrably false.  Just do a search:

What gets upvoted when you search for ["Obama drones"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+drone+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all) or ["Obama torture"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+torture+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all ) ?  If we assume a liberal bias of the politics subreddit and that upvotes confer agreement (both generally accepted ideas) we find that liberals are promoting news articles which are sharply critical of the President on both of these issues.  

For example here are the Obama drone links sorted by "relevance" and "all time". 14 of the top 15 are unambiguously negative in their commentary on the President.   Only one (#8) is ambiguous.  None are positive.  A quick check of the posters submission streams will confirm that they are liberals.

1. House Democrats demand Obama release full legal basis for drone strikes

2. How Drones Help Al Qaeda: DEAR OBAMA, when a U.S. drone missile kills a child in Yemen, the father will go to war with you, guaranteed. Nothing to do with Al Qaeda. 

3. Jon Stewart Eviscerates Obama For Withholding Drone Memos: What Happened To Promise Of Transparency? 

4. New Evidence That Team Obama Misled Us About the Drone War - Official speeches are crafted to give the impression that we're mostly targeting Al Qaeda members. We're not.

5. 5 Ways President Obama Has Doubled Down on Bush's Most Tragic Mistakes: Obama has kept the U.S. on a permanent war footing, from drone strikes and proxy detentions to warrantless wiretapping and the continued operation of Guantanamo.

6. Obama Will Finally Have to Explain Why the US Can Kill Americans with Drones

7. President Obama: The drones don't work, they just make it worse

8. No More Drones For CIA. Three senior officials tell Daniel Klaidman that the Obama administration is poised to shift the CIAs drone program to the Pentagon.

9. Jon Stewart Slams Obama Over Drone Strike Memo 


10. The president as hitman in chief --"Obama has launched over 250 drone attacks during his three years in office, more than six times as many as the lawless yahoo Bush ordered during his entire presidency."


11. Why do liberals not attack Obama for perpetuating Bush's foreign policy?


12. Nobel Prize winner Malala told Obama U.S. drone attacks fuel terrorism.

13. Right wingers gloating about Obama on Fox News: "He's a born-again neocon. We've got the drones, we've got military tribunals, we've got Gitmo, we're bombing Libya. People who voted for Obama got 4 more years of Bush." - 

14. What happened to the anti-war left? 

15. Noam Chomsky: Obama Is Running Biggest Terrorist Operation That Exists... People have a reaction when they lose a loved one to an American drone strike. They dont say, Fine, I dont care if my cousin was murdered. They become what we call terrorists.

**EDIT** More support that this is liberal opinion: the sources are all center left to left. TruthDig, RawStory, The Atlantic, Vice, Al Jazeera, Daily Beast, NYTimes. 




 Typical right winger spouting false equivalency bullshit.  See my response in this thread. 




 Conservatives are, in essence, profoundly anti-American.   














 But Democrats, generally speaking, aren't arguing *for* torture.  They are (some of them) only deluded in thinking their leader is anti-torture.  Separate issue. 




 Even worse is people saying that it shouldn't matter because all Presidents are then guilty.  Normally, one should take this as an indictment of government policy, but some people think it's an excuse.  It's an indication of how corrupt the public's ethics and discourse have become since 9/11. 




 No question, but it's worth reviewing Reagan's statements on the matter to see how far we've drifted in our public debate. 














 **Submission Statement**

Torture apologists on the right have tried to obscure the commitments of United States to prosecute torture.  Who better than their most holy saint to explain it to them?  This is Reagan's message to the Senate advocating ratification of the "Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment", which he notes was agreed to *unanimously* by the international community.  The Convention was ratified by the US Senate in 1994.  



















 The US is a signatory to the Geneva conventions which are a direct result of the Nuremberg trials. 




  You can execute nearly every US president if you apply the Nuremberg laws.

Speaks volumes about US policy, doesn't it. 









 Please read the words of the US prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Justice Robert Jackson of SCOTUS:

["And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment."](http://www.roberthjackson.org/the-man/speeches-articles/speeches/speeches-by-robert-h-jackson/opening-statement-before-the-international-military-tribunal/ ) 




 **Submission Statement**

The opening statement of Justice Robert Jackson of the SCOTUS at the Nuremberg Trials.  Of great relevance is the emphasis he puts on the equal application of the laws not only on Germany and Japan, but also on the victors, the United States, Britain and other axis powers.   









 **Submission Statement**

An important article that's worth a read for those who've been following the torture debate.  While the idea of accountability for these crimes has long seemed like a naive hope held by human rights advocates and parts of the left, this article explains that serious consideration is being given to the concept in international legal circles. 









 **Submission Statement**

An in-depth discussion of the historical, philosophical origins of the legal tradition of "Rule of Law" and what it means.  This is discussion from last year, but seems particularly relevant in light of the recent torture revelations and the stories about grand juries failing to bring indictments against police officers.  

 

 









 Thanks for the links.  That's helpful. 




 Undoubtedly they will ignore.  And agree that the Nobel Peace Prize winner is on the hook too. 




 So you're arguing that no one should attempt to hold anyone responsible for war crimes... because everyone is guilty?

How is that different from the argument that we shouldn't enforce any laws because police are corrupt? 




  But the UN has a fair amount to answer for as well especially with African peacekeeping operations where blue helmets have done their fair share of rape, pillaging, torture and failure to prevent genocide. 

I haven't heard that before. Do you have links?

Are you arguing that (1) American war crimes should go unpunished, or are you saying that (2) there's no organization that has the moral authority to do it, or that (3) it is politically impractical, therefore will never happen?  I just flat out disagree with (1) - a completely immoral idea.

I don't really understand (2) --- one could have argued that the Dresden bombings and Hiroshima/Nagasaki obviated the allies' right to judge their enemies, for instance.  So I don't buy what you're advocating in (2).

However,  the prediction in (3) seems plausible.  Powerful elites are rarely held accountable, so that would be par for the course.
 




 Pardoning them continues a terrible precedent, one that began with the pardon of Richard Nixon, and which has metastasized into a full-fledged dual-tier system of justice.  People at the bottom are viciously punished  for relatively minor offenses (including being killed as part of "normal" law enforcement activity), while elites, guilty of massive war and financial crimes, go free. 









 I don't think it absolves them --- we didn't use that reasoning for Germans and Japanese.   









 They are advocating going after both the officials who ordered and the people who acted on the orders. 




 I can't wait until someone responds to this kind of bullshit (on TV) with "We don't hate America. We hate *you*. Because you represent the opposite of all the true values of this country." 









 Appropriate handle. 




 It's quite a trick they're pulling -- appearing to condemn torture, while having worked consistently to prevent this from coming to light, and undermining any form of accountability.   




 Not a matter of disagreement.  Everyone must be equally accountable under the law. 




 Clever of W and Dick to opt out before their crime spree.
 




 Said every fascist everywhere. 




 Good idea, let's compare ourselves to religious extremist terrorists.  Oh wait, that describes the Republican party, doesn't it? 




 Thanks.  I think my point is that the conversation begins with us as citizens - not to fall into the nationalistic realpolitik that the Sunday shows want us to buy into. Partisans (on both sides, though the right bears more guilt) want to shield their leaders from prosecution.  This is a kind of imperial and authoritarian politics which is directly at odds with the revolutionary principles which have guided us up until recent decades.   




  I simply mean to say that the U.S.'s contribution to the world through the UN is the only reason the UN has stayed quasi-relevant at best. 

I don't disagree with that.  Our elected leaders may think that because "they" fund the UN, they should not be accountable.  My point is that the citizens of the US fund the UN, not our elected leaders.  The question is whether we, as citizens of the US, want a policy whereby our military and elected officials may not be held unaccountable for war crimes by anyone.  That is the politics of authoritarianism, and directly counters basic American ideals.

 The enforcement of UN policies when referencing the actions of individual nations have been, since the existence of the UN, slanted with national interests from the accusing parties. 

Isn't this exactly the point of the UN? A place where international disputes can be settled peacefully and with the agreement of the world community?

 Not to mention the UN ignoring multiple instances of genocide and torture throughout the world giving less and less reason for the US or any member nation to submit themselves to ICC prosecution.

Could you give examples of this?  The first thing that comes to mind is ignoring what happened in Rwanda.  The current example that comes to mind is Palestine, and before that, Nicaragua's CIA-funded death squads, and East Timor.  Apart from Rwanda, in all of these cases the US was directly involved or shielding a client state from accountability.  In the Rwandan case, the US (under Clinton) and its allies put pressure on the UN to ignore the warning signals.

Regarding the ICC, Bush and Cheney opted out at the beginning of their term, and conveniently  before embarking on a spree of war crimes. So I'm not sure what you mean when you say 

  It's time for the U.S. to stop playing with the UN 

That is already the case.  The US and its clients commit atrocities and are not held accountable.  

I'm also confused by the idea that the US "should just acknowledge that world affairs are not black and white".  I can only infer that this means we should continue our policy of committing and supporting war crimes and justifying it by any means necessary in the UN - when that suits us.  Obviously, I strongly disagree.  

 




 "Don't police the policemen!", said all wingnuts everywhere. 
























  One of my favorite films. 

Mine too :). 




 I thought the Barry Lyndon voice over had a quite different character than what one finds in Nolan -- there's a very wry kind of observation going on constantly.  The voice itself is a character that more serves the purpose of highlighting the absurd humor of the proceedings than being a blunt expositor of plot and emotion as in Nolan. 




 The sound mix was deliberate - I think there's a video of him talking about it somewhere - or see [here](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/interstellar-sound-christopher-nolan ).  The effect he was going after was the experience of being in those situations -- where the human voice is merely part of the soundscape, another sound effect.  Hitchcock used this technique very deliberately  when critical pieces of exposition were being delivered.  The effect was to cause the audience to pay greater attention - to lean in to observe a critical moment.  In Interstellar, the frustration of not hearing voice helps us experience the chaos, the overwhelming power of the phenomena that the astronauts experience. 




 So we should support deception because "it's a blog".

 














 For the record, I don't think history will be kind to him, and he'll deserve it.  His legacy is one of failing to hold criminals accountable --- the architects of torture and war crimes from the Bush era, as well as those on Wall Street.  His presidency will be compared unfavorably with FDR's.  He will be seen as having failed to seize the opportunities in a pivotal moment, choosing instead to extend the authoritarian and neoliberal policies of his predecessors.  He will be seen as ushering in an era of deep and unrelenting pessimism when he could have articulated a new direction forward. 









 Reiterating findings is perfectly fine - I'm objecting to the title.  It's a cheesy marketing  trick.  The author had some old article about group psych kicking around, added a couple of flimsy lines about Ferguson, and pasted this title on it.  This is both lazy and deceptive. 




 Why?  That's the message of Republicans at both the state and national levels. 




 You obviously didn't listen to Sen. Rockefeller's testimony at the hearings. 




 Seems like the title is link bait for a fairly general article on basic findings of group psychology. 









 Where is it? 




   I note with some exasperation, by the way, that he feels the need to throw some imprecations regarding the financial industry into an article about an issue that has nothing to do with it. 

Let me defend him.  I think his insight is quite apropos.  There is a mounting frustration that the entire game is rigged.  People on the bottom get treated brutally for tiny infractions, while elites get away with crimes.  That certainly is part of the cultural zeitgeist.   

In Berkeley and Oakland, a large number of the demonstrators are self-identified Occupy activists. It's a very short leap for these people to connect the same dots that Taibbi has. The original target of Occupy was Wall Street, which activists argued were essentially stealing from the public, but which the government was unwilling to police.  Now, these same people are out on the streets angry that powerless people are over-policed.  That is Taibbi's argument in a nutshell.

In the original protests, the police, were largely perceived as preserving public order, though there was a sense, because of their occassional overzealousness that they stood on the side of the "elite criminals of Wall Street" (i.e., from the perspective of the activists).  Yet, that role was only incidental.  As a result of the Ferguson/Garner protests, police themselves are now the issue.  So, in the eyes of the protesters, they have gone from being an instrument protecting elite criminals to themselves being criminals themselves in need of policing.  

That is what Taibbi is talking about.  Those activists on the ground are starting to see the police themselves as illegitimate.  That is a sea change.  I think you'll agree that in this light, the stats you cite (from 2011, no less) aren't really in scope here.  This is a question of what will happen at the next demonstration, now that police themselves are seen as part of the problem.   And in fact, [recent polls support the argument that, amongst minorities at least, confidence has been lost](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-shows-deep-racial-divide-confidence-law-enforcement-n263041 ): 

 And while 72 percent of the public and 79 percent of whites say that they have "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of confidence that police in their community will not use excessive force on suspects, just 43 percent of black Americans say the same.

Conservatives are unlikely to see things this way because it doesn't fit their narrative, but their opinions don't matter in this.  A powerful anger is brewing which inequities and injustices will continue to feed, meaning that there will be more protests.  What will happen at the next one and the next one after that now that those protesters see the police as illegitimate? 














 "Reagan bankrupted the Soviet Union" is conservative propaganda that originates from the same crowd that sold us the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction:

http://open.salon.com/blog/paul_j_orourke/2009/01/17/losing_the_cold_warthe_true_story_of_why_the_ussr_fell

The real explanation is more boring, but has the benefit of being believable: the Soviets couldn't produce enough grain so relied on oil exports.  When the Saudi oil embargo ended,oil prices fell by 2/3rds and the USSR's export income collapsed.  Reagan didn't do that, and no one claims he's responsible for that either. 

Gorbachev and other Soviet officials support this view: http://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm.  

 A far more persuasive reason for the Soviet economic decline is the rigid "command economy" imposed by Stalin in the early 1930s. It did not reward individual or collective effort; it absolved Soviet producers from the discipline of the market; and it gave power to officials who could not be held accountable by consumers. Consequently much of the investment that went into the civilian sector of the economy was wasted. 

 Gorbachev felt free to make a series of proposals for deep cuts in his country's nuclear arsenal because he was confident that the United States would not attack the Soviet Union. In conversation with his military advisers he rejected any plans that were premised on war with the West. Since he saw no threat of attack by the United States, Gorbachev was not intimidated by the military programs of the Reagan Administration. "These were unnecessary and wasteful expenditures that we were not going to match," he told us. If both superpowers were to avoid the growing risk of accidental war, they had to make deep cuts in their strategic forces. "This was an imperative of the nuclear age."

In fact, a Soviet ambassador insists that Reagan's policies unwittingly prolonged the Cold War: "Star Wars was exploited by hardliners to complicate Gorbachev's attempt to end the Cold War."  The hero in ending the Cold War, if there was one, was Gorbachev. 



















  And unless the police suffer a massive crisis of legitimacy, such that on a very basic level we outright don't trust them to use force, this is pretty much the way it has to be. 

Interesting that you mention that.  Did you see Taibbi's latest?
http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-police-in-america-are-becoming-illegitimate-20141205 




 He was present when the Soviet Union ended, but he certainly didn't end it.  The Soviet Union collapsed because its economic system was intrinsically broken, or do Republicans disagree with that now?  Or do they just disagree with that only when they want to praise Reagan?

LOL.  That's why Democrats today are the ones waving the Confederate flag, right?  Oh, wait... 




 It's a sick joke.  We spend billions on war to protect the  interests of billionaires, fake-praise the troops to make the task seem honorable, and discard the broken bodies and lives that come out of the process.

Why are Americans unable to  understand the game that's being played? 





























 This guy's name is Redditt. 









 Agree - that and supporting Liberman over Lamont. 




 Honestly, that seems somewhat myopic.  It's pretty clear to even the most casual observer that they are both on the conservative side of the spectrum on many issues.  Hillary, arguably even more hawkish than Bill.  If we ignore the past, we'll repeat our mistakes.  If we don't understand history, we're won't ask the right questions today. 




 Hillary is not just 20 years ago. 




 There are a lot of "liberals" who didn't pick up on Obama's conservative politics until it was far too late and still don't understand that the Clintons are part of the problem.    




 Understanding our mistakes is the first step if we want to avoid repeating them.  Electing conservadems is proven path to failure. 









 "Hard choices".  Neoliberals really ought to trademark that one.  Blair and his comrades have been making the "hard choices" to serve the interests of globalist billionaires, and the voters are making it difficult for do-gooders like him to transfer even more wealth to them using the levers of government.  If only the  common people were capable of understanding!

I don't have words for the kind of disgust that Blair and his ilk fill me with. 














 How does one get arrested for selling loosies?  Broken windows policing.

 Not even sure it should be appointed by the governor.  The requirement should be a truly independent prosecutor, though I imagine there are all kinds of problems having this be run out of the DoJ. 




 A lot of disease were mocked as psychological disorders before the causes were discovered.   One of the messages that needs to get out is that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a thing that can be seen with molecular diagnostics like RAST. 




 It's a Kenyan plot! 




 Could not replicate.  I got exactly the same prices.  Even used a different browser so it didn't have cookies from my previous search. 




 Race is a big part of it:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/feature/wp/2013/03/22/gun-deaths-shaped-by-race-in-america/ 




  Look at the crime hotspots.. the areas where most of these murders occur. They aren't in places with super-high firearms ownership like Wyoming or New Hampshire. They're in Detroit, Chicago..

Did a quick search.  It looks like most of the violence per capita is in southern cities, but not, interestingly, in southern rural areas:

http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/20/news/la-ol-gun-homicide-states-20121220

 Urban states with heavy gang populations such as California and New York aren't particularly high up on the list of per-capita gun killings, though of course in terms of absolute numbers, they look like murder capitals because of their big populations. 

 **Mid-size Southern states seem to be the places people are trigger-happiest** -- and where, of course, political opposition to gun control often runs strongest. Perhaps that's because **most of the bloodletting happens in Southern cities**, and it's in rural areas -- where gun violence is slight -- that gun rights are held most sacred.


A good graphic in this link:
http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/ 




 Two marketing agencies serving the same customer. 




 That's rational policy, though.   




 So many racists on reddit nowadays. 




 Why do you think gun violence is so much higher here in the United States?  By the way - I'm not reflexively anti-gun.  I'm from Canada, and we have more guns per person up there, but way fewer gun deaths per person. 




 The coffee lawsuit is an urban legend.  If you know the facts, it's pretty clear that McDonald's deserved the punitive damages:

 Trial testimony showed that at 180 to 190 degrees, McDonald's coffee was much hotter than that served by other restaurants or by people in their homes. **The fast-food chain had received at least 700 complaints about hot coffee in the previous decade and had paid more than half a million dollars in settlements**, according to trial testimony cited by the Wall Street Journal. 



 Liebeck's injuries were hardly minor. She suffered third-degree burns on her thighs and groin area, was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo painful skin grafts. **Before filing a lawsuit, she wrote McDonald's requesting that it lower the temperature of its coffee and cover her uninsured medical bills and incidental costs of about $20,000. McDonald's offered $800**.



 Later, as the case neared trial, a mediator recommended that McDonald's pay a settlement of $225,000. The company refused. 



 Jurors ultimately awarded Liebeck $160,000 in compensatory damages and about $2.7 million in punitive damages. "The facts were so overwhelmingly against the company," one of the jurors told the Journal. "Their callous disregard was very upsetting," another said.

 Just a note, neoliberals != liberals.  Neoliberals are people who espouse laissez-faire trade policy --- i.e., typically conservatives. 




 But not everyone does, and the result is a society with an enormous number of gun deaths.  I like to drive fast and I haven't been in any accidents.  It doesn't mean I should have the right to drive 150 through a school zone. 




 As a comparison, British citizens are 100 times less likely to be shot by a police officer than Americans: http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/08/armed-police 




 Surely, that's meant sardonically. 




 Insults not withstanding, you haven't shown anything to prove your case. 









 That is not what the article says.  You're reading the conclusion you'd like to see.

 Police officers get that benefit of the doubt at every step along the way. 

And

 The lack of serious second-guessing is baked into the system.

And

Still, even that low-end estimate suggests that police shoot and kill someone in the United States more than once a day, on average. The overwhelming majority of those killings are deemed justified before the case ever reaches a jury.

And

Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEights Ben Casselman has argued, prosecutors rely on the police to do their jobs day in and day out, so they have few reasons to prosecute a cop aggressively and plenty of incentive to present a less persuasive case than they might otherwise, consciously or not.

And 

  Those cases certainly exist, even if they are likely more uncommon than is generally accepted.... In reality, its a wonder that any cop ever gets indicted for killing someone in the line of duty.

Say the opposite. 









 And even then, who knows what prosecutors tell a Grand Jury?  It's not enough.  There needs to be a special prosecutor appointed when cops are accused.   



















 I think it's a Hangouts thing.  It is built to use as much CPU as possible.  It's offloading compute to the clients. 









 On Chrome or Safari, it practically pins all the CPUs.  

Lots of people are seeing it: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hangouts+cpu+usage 




 I want good voice/video.  Hangouts is horrendous - it's impossible to receive calls, and absolutely chews through battery (1% per minute on my 2.5GHz Quadcore 2015 Macbook Pro).  Skype, well, Microsoft managed to make the UX even worse, didn't they?

And group chat/video is critical, especially for work, so I think this could be a really important entry into the field.  These guys know what they're doing.
 









 Interesting, thanks for the clarification. 




 Agree that insisting on a specific outcome in a specific case when the facts aren't known isn't productive.  However, this is a teaching moment, and this case falls into a broad pattern.  It's very much worth pointing that out. I was pretty disgusted with the righteous, near-racism here on Reddit when the prosecutor gave his extremely unusual defense of the person he was supposedly prosecuting.  The real story is that cops keep getting off and prosecutors keep protecting them, so I think it's worth getting that story out. 




 It's not a coverup, it's business as usual.  If there's a conspiracy, it's one that happens all the time, and is to be expected when colleagues are in charge of policing each other.  In fact, [while grand juries *almost always* indict, they frequently don't when the defendant is a police officer.]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ )

Ironically, the right - which is constantly warning of Obama's jackbooted government thugs coming to take their guns away to Kenya - wants to change the conversation when the left points out systemic issues leading to an actual police state.  

Prosecutors shouldn't be in charge of prosecuting their direct colleagues.  The glaring conflict of interest is producing the expected result, and the obvious moral hazard means cops act with impunity.  This isn't speculation - it's fact, and a situation which is being repeated constantly for obvious, logical reasons.  Body cameras are only a part of the solution. The next step is a law requiring  special prosecutors to deal with police criminality.  

 




 But I thought a grand jury needs to indict him, and that you can't call two grand juries for the same case (or does double jeopardy not apply here?)
