 Were they ashes by chance? 




 3 Might be an Astilbe

7 Also looks like a willow

9 Is a rhododendron, depending on where you live it might be ok (they are evergreen and never look hot right after thaw).

11 More hostas

12 some kind of rose 









 Oh, and I bought from Standard HEPA filter, a German company. It seems they don't sell filters anymore (?) For anyone who can power through the german:

 I bought a home hood about 8 months before returning to grad school. Since then I've been using the super academic hood. Essentially zero contams with the vigorous edible fungi, even when filling culture syringes. It sucks, but this is a rare case where more money actually equals better performance.

Pro tip: Quit your job and go back to school. Contam free. But bills. Lots of bills. 




 But hey! As a first world citizen that ate three meals today, I declare the rest of the world should not grow GMOs. Even if that means not enough food to go around...


A few companies in control of any commodity is something to keep an eye on, but this is a bigger issue. It is a moral failing to not allow reasonable deployment of GMOs. The world has a lot of people. Too many went to bed hungry tonight. These shitheads stand in the way of a partial solution. 




 Oh, it is. No one got arrested last year. We'll see if we can keep that going. 




 A 'hash house' is a place to get cheap grub. Don't you know your pre-war British slang?

Go to a Mallard's game, get duckblind tickets. 




 I bought this book years ago. Expensive, but many nights of reading.

 One of those CO2 inflaters are nice too. Much lighter than a comparable pump for side-of-the-road repairs. 




 News: Madison Police shooting people!

...No wait, that's not news at all. 




 Eh, personal experience. Skaters, more than even pedestrians, seem to have no awareness of their surroundings. Just about three hours ago I almost hit a dude on a board since he was going the wrong way down state and not looking.

On a bike, Peds have right-of-way in all cases except at a controlled intersection. Skaters don't have the same right-of-way.

I'd be pissed if there was a soccer game in the street everyday too. It would impinge on others' fair use of the street. 




   There is lots of nice concrete, no cars, and even a skate store right there.

So skate culture is oblivious to the mixed-use nature of State? All the Pedestrians, bicyclists, cabs, and buses don't use that street at all. But hey! It's not like it's illegal... 




 Haha, if someone left a bike out all winter, I don't think ideal pressure is on the radar. 




 Is skate culture a thing? 









 No. I actually said that to a biker this morning.

I was also on a bike, but following the law. 




 It's a [Poe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law). 




 You know, when I first heard of "cedar-apple rust" I thought it meant it looked like cedar "apples". Even though I now know better, I stand by my first assessment.
 




 Bullshit! God's power deceases by the inverse square. 




 I've always liked aquatic plants with this growth form. You could hardly design a system better at capturing all the light that hits a surface. 









 If you hit a [wood turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_turtle), Bowser will haunt you until you hit him twice with the Mecha Koopa.
