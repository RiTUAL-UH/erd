 I bounced around troops when I was in scouts, so for my eagle project, since I didn't know a lot of people, I tried to do something small, that didn't require a lot of people, and that could still have a big impact.  I would shy away from doing trail restorations, or building any large structures as those require a lot of people.  I looked at those options first, but after asking my new troop what other Eagle Scouts had done in the past, I was able to replicate an old project and knocked the whole thing out in a weekend with a handful of volunteers.  By asking the adult leaders and new Eagle Scouts for ideas on your project, you show that you're really trying to make an impact on the community you're moving to.  By showing an interest in them, they're more likely to help you both with ideas and by encouraging their friends and sons, in the case of the adults, to lend you a hand.  It also doesn't hurt that helping with an Eagle project counts as volunteer work for advancement, so you don't need to feel like any of these guys would be going way out of their way to help you.
