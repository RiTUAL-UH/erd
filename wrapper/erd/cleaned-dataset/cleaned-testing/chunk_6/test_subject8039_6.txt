 Can anyone tell me where these woods are? I want to do some research on the Whistlers. To me, it seems as though they are just people that are driven to this primal place in order to survive these woods, and then are drawn into a war they had no idea was taking place with this creature out there. This creature is the true problem, the reason that people may die. However, if the Whistlers can get to the people first, then the people would be safe.  




 Keep us updated as to whether or not it's Tommy!! And stay safe, OP. Seriously, the supernatural is not something you want after you. Ever.  




 I just won't tell anyone about her :D Then she can't kill me, can she? 




 So I'm curious, and a little lost, OP. What does cracking your knuckles do?  




 First, I want to thank everyone here for your support :) you're a great group of people, and I'm glad I have this sub. 

Second, this isn't a work related injury. It's just pain brought on by my arthritis. I appreciate everyone's concern, but this isn't the first time this has happened. I'll get through it, I was just hoping someone would have some advice on pain management :/ 




 So some background first. I work in an office as a facilities assistant. That basically means I'm the Break Room Fairy. I stock up the break rooms in the morning, check/set up the conference rooms, deliver mail, that sort of thing. This typically means I'm on my feet all day. As someone with early onset arthritis in one of my knees, this can become quite painful. 

However, today was different. I was delivering some packages, and went to turn around on my heel, a motion I have made thousands of times around here. The only difference? I somehow twisted wrong, and my knee explodes into an instant ten on the pain scale. I couldn't move, nor could I call out. My coworkers don't know I have these knee problems, and letting them know would be bad, as it's only my fifth week on this job. After a few minutes, the pain subsided to an easy seven, but has remained there since. This happened about an hour ago, and every time I go to turn, instant ten again. I just don't know what to do, I'm hoping someone can help? Maybe a couple of pointers, other than not turning on that leg? As I work in an office, it's incredibly difficult to not move and turn this way and that....

Sorry for the long post!! 




 I haven't started season ten yet!! Don't tell me anything!! I tried to start it on Hulu, but Hulu is really dumb and only streams the 5 most recent episodes. So I haven't started it yet. 




 Do you know what House she belongs to? Because that could be a very big gift op there. 




 Are you Sirius with that? That was a very Harry joke. 




 Honestly, I want them to go back to the roots of the show. Start bringing in new monsters like the first season. Or even repeat a few monsters we've seen before. We've seen a few episodes with Shapeshifters, and Vamps of course. But only one werewolf, one woman in white, one Wendigo, etc. However, over 100 demon episodes, plenty with angels, and the like. Honestly, I want some new damn material.
