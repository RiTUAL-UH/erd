 The way I remember it is:

Medica**I**d.... I .....like in **I**ncome.  It is for poor people

Thus the other one, Medica**R**e, is for **R**etires  



















 Only for hourly people. People with a salary don't have to worry about this. 




 I LOVE Pushbullet.  But I have a question in regards to file transfer.

Currently, the only way to transfer pictures from my phone to computer is Pushbullet uploads it to a 3rd party website (amazonaws.com).  But I am not able to delete that picture/file, which is a security flaw.

Is there a way to transfer files to/from my phone/computer directly? 




 Sucks for the Raiders!  














 FUUUCK 














 It's not arbitrary.  The seeding is however they can get all 128 teams to fit, given the results.  Thats why Marshall v. WKU occurs in the first round, with Marshall losing.

 Hornets have been losing the game in the 4th quarter a lot this year.  









 Better than some of the teams that made the leap.  But no they shouldn't.  



















 You sound like a Hornets fan as welll :'''''(

 Adrian Peterson will be eligible for reinstatement on April 15, 2015. He will forfeit six game checks

 Glad the NFL is keeping everyone in check! /s 














 Yeah man!  I just redid everything and now it seemed to work. I turned "off" then back "on" Youku.  Thanks again! 




 Is anyone having "Copyright" issues?  I downloaded Unblock Youku for Firefox, like always.  But it gave me this error.  First time ever.   









 Would it be possible for a non-ACC/SEC team to receive an invite to the Belk Bowl?  Like maybe another NC team (e.g. **East Carolina**)?  I think it would be beneficial to all parties.

 So you want me to participate, even if I don't have anything to say? 




 Good 'ol **Chuck Amato** is still pulling almost 200k at Akron 




 Bud Foster's salary is more than the total staff pay at **43** FBS schools.   



















 I think I figured a working solution, if anyone cares.

I created a new column list and added the handles I wanted a notification sound for.  Then I just collapsed the column so it doesn't take up any space, but I still will get the sound.  Not too difficult. 




 It is interesting to see how much of Georgia won't get the Falcons game.   


































 I LOVE watching the woman on the left's disgust.  What a bitch. 









 Poor lil fella 







































 ECU will play in the Swamp next season as well.  So that is......interesting. Twice in one year 




 Illinois vs. Louisiana Tech in Heart of Dallas Bowl 









 Arkansas vs. ECU in Bham 




 vs. Arkansas  




 vs. LSU 




 Yeah, Virginia Tech 
























 Just because you don't care, doesn't mean others don't want to discuss the games.  
























 Also: the modern [New Great Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Great_Game) 



















 The more "popular" subreddits I block, the more porn I receive in my r/all feed.  I guess it is a win-win. 









 Not saying it's not true, but anyone can and does update Wikipedia without confirmation.

 You don't know the "reddit story" about Colby? 














 A lot of the MAC would do better in FCS, I believe.  




 Logical candidates to replace UAB in C-USA: 

Liberty, James Madison, Georgia State, South Alabama, Texas State, Arkansas State, ULL 




 Yeah, maybe more along the lines of FCS or lower division.

But take Eastern Michigan.  They have average attendance around 4,000 for the past 3 years.

The past 4 years, Ball State has averaged around 9-15k.

Akron 9-17k.

The NCAA REALLLY needs to bring back the 15k butts-in-seats average over 2 years.  Four teams didn't cross 15k in 2013.  Another SIX averaged 15-16k. 

It just feels like a bubble that is about to pop. 




 There are plenty of FBS teams that should disband football. But UAB isn't one of them.   









 You know Barack Obama?!  









 So Ray Rice is now immediately reinstated and can sign with any team any time

 Its THE REAL ACCOUNT!!!! AHHHH YIS 




 I am able to click incognito or search google for "John Smith linkedin" on incognito and find their full page.   




 Incognito. So you can see a profile without it notifying them. 














 A Falcons loss is good for the Panthers.  Especially to lose on a last second FG. 




 Falcons lost on a last second Browns FG, after getting the lead with 44 seconds left.  









 By your word usage, I am going to assume you're not from The Colonies.

 When was this particular scene in relation to when we know at that time?   




 Thats pretty awesome!  It would be cool if there was a site that had all the FBS stadiums broken down like that (when possible).  But that would be A LOT of work, for such little payoff.  




 It would be neat if someone color coded each section on when it was built.  So we could see which area was the original - more recent renovation.  



















 I just used this to see when the comet landing will occur, at 14:00 GMT. Typing in "14:00 GMT" converts to local time 




 I don't understand why there aren't any commercials.  Especially if it can help spread some of the cost around.  









 What is *"neat"* about this is to look at the total votes, compared to the congressional districts won.

In **2010**: Democrats had 45.2% of the vote, Republican had 54.1%.

Democrats won 7 seats, Republicans won 6.

**2010 Redistricting**

In **2012**: Democrats had 50.60% of the vote, Republican had 48.75%.

Democrats won 4 seats, Republicans won 9.

In **2014**: Democrats won 3 seats, Republicans won 10. I don't have the percentages for this race yet.

So before the redistricting, both parties reflected the overall direction of the state.  Post-redistricting, and gerrymandering has taken over.

 Poor Rams 




 Now I had TIMBERRRR 




 Is the sound working? Or do I have issues going on my side? 




 Correct: TNF, SNF, MNF 




 There's nothing hilarious about them.  They're AWESOME! 




 Can you add additional items?  Like circle division members, and the ability to toggle that on/off.  Or a distance measure tool? 




 He was there.  Unsure about a reaction video of this one.  




 Cause Charlotte was built with Banking money! 




 Still now? 




 How about THAT THREEE?

 I thought that had something "weird" with it.  That's why I used "Stealthy" in Firefox instead.   









 Damnit.

Nope, he was correct.  The correct spelling is "dammit".

 I wonder how many of the Hornets were already fans, but just recently liked the new FB page. 



















 I assume when actual breaking news occurs, this will be good.  Cause it looks like a bunch of fluff pieces currently.  




 And this is the first year Marshall has done anything since then.
