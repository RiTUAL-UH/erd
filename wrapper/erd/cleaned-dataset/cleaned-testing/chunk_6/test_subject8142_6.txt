 I think that might be less than what my high school drew, and I'm from Indiana. I know we got more than that for basketball pretty regularly for weekend games. 




 I'm still lobbying to let Muffet McGraw, our women's basketball coach, coach as many teams as possible. 




 I bet Kansas would let you have another former coach of yours named Charlie back. 




 Not really singing, more just waxing poetic. Though I guess it's similar to the way Shatner sings, so there's that. 




 I fucked Ted. 




 So are the other 2. 




 Don't hate on CJ's. Bar of choice for football players and who wouldn't be distracted by all the people under 21 there? 




 I could see that if it were the Beatles or Michael Jackson, or someone equally big. I'm not sure the Beastie Boys are quite big enough to be listened to 250 years from now. Sabotage never even made it onto the Billboard Hot 100. 




 Katana umbrella, even better. 




 As does Captain Kirk, who apparently drives to 250 year old music. 




 He looks like The Situation. 




 This and clearing cache and cookies. Solves 95% of my calls about things that aren't working. 




 Navy does that to us all the time. Niumatalolo says it's ok because they play for Navy. I'm fine with the cut blocking, they don't have the athletes to keep up otherwise and I understand that. It's the flagrant dirty hits after the play's over that are 15 yards away from the ball that I have the issue with. 




 Fair enough, Northwestern might as well be in the leaders division though. 




 I understand that, I just figure if one of the teams has a division's name in its fight song, you might as well make that division the one they're in. 




 How was Michigan not put in the Leader division? 




 My complaint is more at plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ) 




 This is why I hate playing Navy. So many cheap hits. 




 I'm pretty sure we always lead the country in 6'8" unathletic white guys. 




 Yeah, I'm a huge Hulls fan, but you have to go with Zeke here. 




 My favorite Gunner Kiel moment was at one point he tweeted something and ended it with #GunnerKielQuotes . Alpha move right there. 




 My issue with Rees is that he reached his ceiling about 3 years ago. His ceiling is not high enough to win us a championship without great players around him, and probably a Heisman candidate at running back. Golson has a much higher ceiling, and is a better fit for Kelly's offense. 




 Ross Browner and friends were pretty good for us in the 70s after leaving for a year. 




 Things Boys Do We Love. 




 Baylor hasn't been in shootouts though. Yeah it gave up 42 to WVU, but who cares when you score 73. That's not a close game at all. Their closest game is a 2 score game over the defending conference champion (who admittedly is nowhere near what they were last year). 




 A 19 year old complained about getting carded? I'd understand maybe if they were like a young looking 30 year old or something who maybe looked 24, but a 19 year old is barely old enough anyway. 




 I have him, and of course the guy I play today has Megatron. 




 Title IX, yo. 




 To be honest, though, even without the rule, a top 8 Notre Dame is going to a BCS bowl. Honestly a top 12 Notre Dame probably is. That has nothing to do with a sweetheart deal with the BCS, and everything to do with our fanbase. The same is true of an at large Texas or Alabama or USC or Ohio State. Financially it just makes more sense for the bowls to take those schools. 




 Which for the record, is actually a more difficult rule than the non AQ conference teams. They have to be in the top 12. Granted it's much easier for us to be in the top 8 than them be in the top 12, but that's more a product of who we play. 




 Not to mention I can't imagine he'd be feeling great during the game given the altitude. 




 Nixon's foreign affairs wasn't terrible either. He did open up relations with China. 




 At this rate in 3 years he'll win a national championship. 




 Please no. 




 Well we already know Rees can't outrun cops so they wouldn't have too much trouble catching him. 




 Hey now, they did manage to to hold the running game under 250 yards. 




 Dan Fox holding onto that leg for dear life. 




 Thanks for the PTSD, ND. 




 How was that not a block in the back? 




 He watches game film of the 2011 Michigan game for help. 




 The Tommy Rees vs Michigan special. 




 I could have made that pass. 




 In fairness most teams will see a pretty substantial drop off to their 3rd string QB, which is basically what Hendrix is. 




 Bring back the Irish Chocolate package. 100% TD rate to this point. 




 I've known all year he was our best option. My issue with Tommy is we're not winning a championship with him. He's a 9-10 win QB. Nothing wrong with that, it still means he's a good QB. It's just that someone like Golson has the potential to win a championship someday. 




 This would work a lot better if we believed in fullbacks. 




 I'd probably rather not. Tommy ought to be back next week, or at least by the time we play someone we can't beat with Hendrix. It'd be a shame to burn a redshirt for a quarter and a half, even if it is SC. I'd rather just run all game. 




 Poor Dayne. Couldn't catch a break. 




 [The Observer](http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/sports/kelly-says-tuitt-stumbled-into-question-about-future-1.3095756#.UmM2xvleZ8F). 




 Who's ready to start running the triple option? 




 Tuitt's playing better now that he's not going pro after this year. 




 The occasional good plays do not a good QB make.  




 I miss Manti. 




 Carlson and Zibby were the only bright spots on that 2007 team. 




 Last time one did the SEC got screwed. 




 Best player ever in ppr. 




 And those aren't even the home games they coached. There's probably more that have coached less than 14 at home. 




 I would be so conflicted if Sexy Rexy coached at USC. 




 That makes more sense. I was wondering who could have possibly lost a flair bet to Purdue. 




 And you're Eskimo brothers through Montana. 




 The main reason I liked City better was I felt like there was more to do. Aside from the main story Asylum was basically just go get Riddler trophies. City had a bunch of other side quests. 




 It's not often you see Berkeley calling another school nerdy. 




 So half the people wouldn't show up to vote and then would forget about politics until the next election when they make sure they're registered? This is how my fantasy leagues go. 




 Oh ok, I was wondering why she was making a pizza while shaving her legs. 




 Good field position is an understatement. He was handed 7 points, and basically giftwrapped another 14. 




 The Lout Holtz approach. A few years ago Lou was talking about how Weis would have an easier time coaching when we played at BC because he was used to playing in the Boston area and his mind would be right. He then said he always felt like if he got to coach at William and Mary while he was coach at ND, he would have coached a great game. One of the other guys called him out on it and said yeah and they would have had a Heisman caliber QB and been favored by 30 points according to you. No one could talk up Army or Purdue like Lou Holtz. 




 Personally I think USC needs a coach with major college experience. Maybe one who's won a major conference and gone to a BCS Bowl like the Rose Bowl. One who's coached places like Stanford and Notre Dame, who has ties to California recruiting and the west coast.

The only option is Lionel Tyrone Willingham.  




 Fuck that bullshit. I'm a Dem in Indiana, but I loved Richard Lugar. Tea Party tries to oust him with an idiot like Mourdock. They could have, too, until he started talking. Thank God the strategy backfired and we got Lugar 2.0 in Donnelly but from the Democrat side. 




 My guess is it's not so much sneak attack dates as they don't want to date outside the church, and figure they'll just be upfront about it. 




 Windows-C also does this. 




 Now if I refer to him as Brobama, where does that fit in in terms of respect? 




 It wasn't 3 time all american, it was 3 year letter winner. 




 A Mac Mini. 




 I would watch a 50 shades movie if it starred Seth Rogen and Emma Stone. 




 But aren't they all "Nice Guys"? 




 I'd like to thank Purdue for not playing this week. 




 We need the NBC 360 cam! 




 Or you have Sam Bradford who stayed another year after being projected to go #1, got injured and barely played, and still went #1. 




 South Carolina has also lost to the only good team they've played. 




 I call shenanigans. That puts the game over in the over/under. Clearly something is amiss here. 




 Yeah, I mean I won't complain about an almost game winning pick, but you need to just bat that down unless you've got nothing but grass between you and the end zone. 




 Could've been a big play.... except for the overthrow and the holding. 




 There was one play where Lombard was blocking 3 people successfully. It was ridiculous. 




 ND doesn't even have a parks and recreation major! Clearly ASU  ND academically. 




 I'm not sure there are too many schools left that USC plays that could actually upset them anyway. 




 Brindza may not be the most accurate kicker, but he's got a hell of a leg. 




 And an 80 yard run against Air Force 2 years ago! 




 How I foresee the rest of this game playing out: We get a TD at some point, one more FG for ASU. We're driving down the field as time's running out at the end of the game. Kelly starts calling pass plays inside the 10 and Tommy throws an INT, instead of trying to kick the FG, Graham beats us at dream job #3. 




 Torii Hunter, Jr. 




 Did anyone else know that Corey Robinson's dad is David Robinson, the NBA player? 




 That's one of the reasons Utah schools do well. They have a bunch of players 2 years older because of Mormon missions. 




 I know a lot of guys that age that buy it. It's health conscious people who don't normally drink soda, but want to mix drinks.  Can't mix rum with water. In the words of my friend who tried "It retains none of the flavor and all of the what the fuck". 




 One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that. 




 You guys should just do tradesies with USC. 




 I think the ACC is better fit. We don't want to be on such an extreme end of any votes that come down to private vs public universities. The ACC is almost tied depending on how you want to count Pitt. And academically they're pretty similar. Yes we like playing UM, MSU, and Purdue from the B1G, but the ACC does have BC, Miami, and Pitt. I also feel like for nonfootball sports it's at least a toss up, if not leaning toward the ACC. We do love our lax. 




 I was under the impression from watching the game on Saturday that Rees was basically Peyton Manning and Bell was Roethlisberger. 




 He's not a comedian, but Mike Tomlin looks like Omar Epps. 




 Honestly the best part is just not wondering how I'm being insulted in a language I don't understand. 




 I stopped playing for about a year. Latin America servers were easily the best addition when I came back. 




 Shit, I was hoping for a nice easy win.
