 Communication studies. My university is considering a policy that mandates students cannot workouts than 20 hours on campus. 20 hours is one assistantship, which just isn't cutting it.  




 All great suggestions! I am a white female getting an MA in Communication Studies. My assistantship includes TAing and teaching one of my own classes. It feels like an impossible task to find scholarships for a non-minority, non-STEM graduate student.  




 My stipend covers rent and utilities. It would be helpful to have a little extra money for groceries and insurance. I really don't want to take out loans. Does anyone have tips for where to look for scholarships for additional living expenses? I got $500/semester grant from the government and that covers my mandatory fees. Thanks!!  




 Take some time to do something for yourself. It doesn't have to cost anything, or take a lot of time. Just try to appreciate making a decision to spend time doing something for yourself like taking a walk, listening to music, or reading a book. I've learned that the more I appreciate and respect myself, the better I am at communicating with others. Good luck! YOU come first.  




 I am on the opposite side of the issue. In fact, one of the worst things about depression for me is that I don't know how to ask my boyfriend or close friends to help. Last night, I called the suicide hotline. I am not suicidal, but I wanted to talk to someone about this extra burden I feel. I don't think I got any straight-forward answers, because I got the feeling that they are just there to listen and guide your thoughts while giving you a chance to talk. However, I don't think I was looking for straight-forward answers. I just needed someone to talk to that I didn't have a committed friendship or with. 

TLDR: Call the suicide hotline for depression counseling. They are also there to help people whose loved ones have depression.  




 Is there a reason why you HAVE to go? He should understand your anxiety. Is there anything you can ask him to do to make it easier on you? Are there things you can focus on enjoying like how well your boyfriend plays his instrument, or how you can reward yourself when you get home? Good luck!!  




 I don't know what your situation is, but I will offer advice with mine. I am in school, and have been seeing my doctor for 9 months. I know I can call and leave a message in the office for a renewal, but if I wanted a higher dosage, I feel like she should be willing to either prescribe it to me (upon hearing the patterns I experience) or recommend me to a doctor in my new area. 

If you call and ask, the worst thing that can happen is they say no. Which is hard when you have depression, but are also able to ask questions beyond those that warrant yes/no answers. 

Good luck. You owe this to yourself!!
