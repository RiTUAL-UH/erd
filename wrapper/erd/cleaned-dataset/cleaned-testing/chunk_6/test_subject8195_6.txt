 I saw all of the original movies and I get the whole Engrish joke. I just don't remember someone talking like that I guess. 




 Yeah, like the episode of Cowboy Bebop where the dude has tits 




 Meh, take more time on it and use thinner strands. 




 I don't understand the title, but this is definitely going in my webm folder 




 It was a long shot, yeah lol 




 I think it's a chick. The username has "esmerelda" in it. Also she posted to a hair dye subreddit of sorts with a picture of herself 




 I searched incognito so it wouldn't go into related searches and bug me 




 What about that original post lol 




 I just looked one up on Amazon and it was like, 35 for a pillow and 35 for a case.  




 I'm in a cold basement and when I blow vapor in my hands it feels like the air around me. It's about 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the basement and 80 degrees Fahrenheit upstairs. The vapor feels colder in a warm environment to me than say, me sitting in my chair right now doing it in the basement.  




 Maybe even two. 




 ring-off 




 Oh yeah the same happens when I watch subbed anime too. Like the creepy dude who almost rapes Sinon in SAO two is the same voice as Izaya from Durarara 




 He's still genuinely asking an airsoft related question. He could have asked something like this in a different format on /r/airsoft 




 Buy a body pillow 




 This is a question that can be answered on /r/airsoft 




 Yeah I remembered that one too lol 




 I noticed that too. There's a sort of comedic effect to it that kept it kind of light, but it sounded really genuine.  




 Yeah, Rittsu was the same voice as Kirito's little sister in SAO. I picked it up right away and it bugged me. 




 The voices were similar in the dub, but I've watched a lot of dubbed anime before watching the English dub of K-ON and I could pick out who all of the voice actors were 




 lol meep likes RWBY still 




 3edgy5me just like cameron 




 Yeah there's some nice looking ones on Evike. 




 He could probably pick up a pair of LBX Combat Pants in Glacier Grey and they'd work well 




 Did you FAL in love?  
I FAL in love with my FAL. 




 No G3's  
:'^( 




 Yeah, that'd be cool to do on a CYMA M870 




 What? I'm not him 




 Oh yeah, I'll definitely get shit on for my choice but it'll be fun and unique for me 




 Well it's not gonna be anything special by any means, but definitely unorthodox.  




 Whoa, what shotgun is that? That's pretty snazzy. 




 Too bad they're so rare and expensive. Otherwise I'd pick one up and get a stock. 




 *It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all.  
It's a small world after all. It's a small, small world* 




 45 minute detention for calling a teacher "Dude" 




 My new sidearms are too eccentric to keep out of a collection picture, so of course I gotta wait lol 




 Nah I'll wait lol 




 Sounds cool. I've never had any sidearms besides using my MP5k once or twice. I've never had a use for one, but the field I'm gonna start going to is gonna require one for close encounters which kind of sucks. 




 I got as many rifles as this guy and an SMG but I feel like I need some pistols to balance it out. 




 I should get around to posting my full collection some day, but I think I'll wait until I get some pistols. 




 Oh my god it's the fucking turkey from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  
I'm gonna miss that show. 




 **YEAH WE'RE COOL KIDS** 




 Don't forget his magical plot armor power that he uses to defeat enemies more powerful than him! 




 YEAH WE'RE COOL KIDS. 




 Fuck bandwagons. This isn't even a full picture of a gun.  




 Idk but it's the whole gun. The description says it's based off of a VFC 417. 




 What?  
This is the whole gun and everything lol 




 Oh god, right during my HK buzz and I can't get it. I really hope they release another version that isn't limited edition and more affordable. This is so beautiful. 




 Catbrains said this is a test patch 




 Nah it works 




 It was expected lol 




 ayy lmao 




 Who cares 




 Well mixing black gear with tan based camouflages always looks beginnerish or novice. If he had a tan or OD vest the loadout would look at more professional and experienced.  




 Try some better external lighting and use the camera without the flash to get better pictures. Also tan and multicam a little less beginnerish.  




 Aww yeah I love Fox Stevenson.  




 Then ask Vorperoni 




 Ask good ol' Mr.Catbrains 




 I'm not sure on supply, that's all /u/Catbrains' department 














 I literally checked my inbox just now and thought, "Imma go check the mail" and I got it 




 *Nice.* 




 Oh okay. So yay? I still get patch? 




 It'd look cool without the triforce just randomly stuck on there 




 RemindMe! 2 days 




 Idk talk to Catbrains sempai 




 I'll probably get mine tomorrow. I'll post a pic bb 




 Ah. Makes sense lol 




 It's pretty spot on for what it's like for me.  
There were some parts that went overboard with the "muh triggerings" but they did do good with the respect that there's a lot of specific things that can trigger it.  




 I expected this to be gruesome or something lol  
Not really NSFW 




 I really wanted one of the /r/airsoft patches but it all happened too fast for me to get the money lol.  
I can't wait to get my /r/a_irsoft patch though so that'll be fun. 




 I think there were a few spots where the PTSD factor is shotty, but the show did a wonderful job capturing what PTSD is like as a whole and the daily struggles of it.  




 Ha. Well /r/sinonassonline sounds like your knack Reascr.  




 Oh that makes a lot more sense. It's a nice touch (the counter, that is), and I guess if you leave it in all of your videos it'll make more sense or seem consistent. I just thought it was a little confusing. 

I think it'd look a lot more fluid if you left it un-grainy, but again if you do that consistently in your videos then viewers would become accustomed to it.  




 I just thought it was overall pretty blurry and grainy. What kind of camera are you using?

Also the time counter thing was odd. 




 Oh, keep it up, make videos, and all of that good stuff. Have fun.

Just saying there's definitely room to improve. Like the footage quality isn't the best and the music overpowers the game volume a bit.  




 Nobody else does considering the downvotes. 




 Ew.  
Overpowering music, bad footage quality.  




 Aaaaaand now I want to paint my L96 black, put a silencer on it, get a WE TT-33, and get a Death Gun mask. 

Yes I'm aware that Death Gun doesn't use an L96 or a TT-33, but close enough.  




 We should have an official night and add more mods to it 




 It's my favorite chinese cartoon 




 Yee 




 Everyone pretty much joins and makes an account, and adds videos to the queue. It's pretty dank. http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft 




 That's two posts lol 




 Huh? 









 I don't see a need for overwhelming FPS if I have a good barrel set up and hop up set up.  




 I too, have a [tactical doge.] (http://i.imgur.com/7kNagaU.jpg) 




 Nah 




 Lol I wonder why people are downvoting you 




 Okay lol. You said it was the E above and someone else said it was the E but then someone said it was the standard.

Alright, now I know what it is lol 




 It's good but very underwhelming. 




 Yeah I learned. G36E.  




 Yeah lol.  

Still pissed me off how in the new movie the kid just lugs around a fucking M249 somehow. 




 Oh, that's pretty rough lol 




 Nah it's because it's HTC 




 It's regarded as one of the greatest entry level guns and a great clone. 




 Did the soldiers use AK's and CZ-75's?  
I paid attention to the guns more in the new movie and the only thing that bugged me was the kid carrying a fucking M249 everywhere. 




 ayy dank cheeki breeki may mays  




 Dank may mays? 




 I wasn't trying to greentext, just quote what I was saying lol 




 I thought most slavboos used cheeki breeki Russian guns 




 fuckin redditers man 




 Thanks 




 Yeah I saw the initial downvote and thought, "Well, alrighty then" 




 You said slav. I thought most slavboos used cheeki breeki Russian guns. 




 Catbrains explained lol 




 Meh 




 Meh it's the long one which is the one I like lol 




 Yep. I plan on ghopping it or something along the road 




 I was actually thinking of picking up an MP7 or the VFC GBB UMP to get another needed SMG in there lol

As for the XM8, it's good but isn't what I was expecting. It shoots about as far as my AIM Top M4. About far enough to hit what I want, but pretty underwhelming. 




 I have a friend who's out of the sport and has a G36c he's selling. I tempted to pick it up.  




 Nice. You should pick up a TT-33 or a Makarov. 




 In the description, baby 




 I got around to getting a G36, and decided on my favorite variant. Description's in the album.

Guns,  
JG G36k  
JG G3  
Galaxy MP5k  
SRC XM8 









 lolwut  
Well if I had your username I'd invite you 




 And a skype chat 




 Being wrong about something is the first step to being kind of right about something 




 That AK is probably a CYMA rebrand, just like how the IGOR is a shitty ST rebrand 




 lolwat x 10^23 




 lolwat 




 Ah. The almost VSS.  




 Oh. I don't like how it's drawn and there's like six episodes of flying and talking between three episode fights. 

Otherwise I like it more than Naruto by far and I'm cool with it. 




 Naruto?  
It's the gateway show most people who don't watch a lot of anime watch. I don't like how it's drawn, the characters are all so fucking annoying, it attracts retards, overrated as hell, repetitive long fights, terrible character development, and there's the godawful flashbacks.  




 Most people use the filler thing as a beginning argument but have plenty of other valid reasons to hate it. 

That's what I meant. 




 Not at all. I have plenty of reasons for hating both shows besides that. 




 Nope totally stock, came with that 




 That there is the Echo 1 SOF 2, a rebrand of the JG FAL Carbine.  
The only difference is a Madbull barrel, Echo 1 motor, and Madbull bucking.

In its' prime it shot true and it was a pleasure to field. Only problem was I had to fix the motor height.  




 Something of the sort lol 




 Only reason I've really really kept it is that I really want to P* it some day 




 Oh it's a dead gun now. Just a prop.  
Trigger kind of came out with the gearbox. 




 *Oh of course.* 




 All I need is the cool hat and olive drab short-shorts 




 [Oh yeah baby.] (http://i.imgur.com/LAkBjJq.jpg) 




 A can of Krylon and some time can do wonders 




 41% of Naruto is filler.  
That's almost half of the show lol

Also these downvotes are hilarious 




 Wrong post format.  
Also that gun is fucked.
