 yeah that was sad, could have been a good franchise I dont understand why it bombed.  




 man that would have been awesome!!!!!  




 I think it was Abed alone.  




 Yeah I guess you right and WOW 2 billion dam.  




 I wish Marvel or Disney I should say broke out the checkbook and bought spiderman back for good. I mean its cool he will finally be in the MCU but Sony still has control how awesome would it be for Marvel to have the rights back forever.  




 if they never sold the rights then marvel probably wouldnt exist today.  




 Leto will own the role.  




 Theres really noone worse than Uwe Boll.  




 Probably not  




 because thats the only one I have seen.  




 Kingsman  




 I wish he made a few jokes or something or was in a sketch UGH. was he only there to please the fans???  




 I wanted Wolverine to win.  




 Absofuckinglutely!!!!!!  




 Keaton duh  




 I will harvest that planet tomorrow before I let her take it from me  




 A good performance by Arnie and a few good action scenes but other than that its crap. I couldnt tell if itwas trying to be comedy or thriller sometimes, still worth a watch tho.  




 LOL  




 Awesome movie!!!!! Im gonna see it again!!!!!!  




 LOL  




 I thought this was a creepy post LOL.  




 I know he was only there for five minutes and is played by eric forman of all people but I did like Venom, I wish he was the main villain though.  




 Awesome!!!!!!!  




 Yes he would be good.  




 God its so exciting seeing all of this!!!!!  




 John Mcclane  




 Lion King  




 Heath Ledger  




 Yes  




 YES!!!!!!! its so exciting seeng Spidey come home I hope they can make him have a major role in the civil war film that would be epic!!!!!  




 Logan Lerman or Dylan Obrien  




 I wish they would rewrite the movie to include Spiderman in the major role he has in the comics that would be so cool!!!!!  




 No  




 Movies are meant to be seen without interruptions.  




 Yes thats the reason i go to the theaters so much even watching movies multiple times.  




 Every dam time.  




 I wouldnt mind a sequel but the director is busy it seems.  




 No this is print we dont air Speculation.  




 no  




 Oh god just make it stay dead please.  




 Okay they are just lazy then.  




 they kind of gave up on it because the first one didnt meet their expectations, personally I hope they make it work soon.  




 cool LOL never noticed that before.  




 Did Eddie Redmayne remind anyone else of Pollux troy???  




 its the reason they delayed the movie.  




 lets hope its true.  




 Yes hes an awesome director I think if he focused solely on that it would be cool.  




 Cool  




 Yes I hope thats what Afflecks future is.  




 I didnt think he directed. He would be a good one actually.  




 LOL  




 Good movie I havent seen it for about 10 years now maybe I should revisit it.  




 Which ones do you think should pull a Clint as in Just start directing movies from now on and also act in them??? Personally I think Mel Giobson and Kevin Costner should do that they are both great directors and arent really getting good roles nowadays. Thoughts???  




 OMG that seems horrible!!! Thank god I have never had an experience like that there were a few loud guys yes but not like that. I still go to the movies all the time and I LOVE IT!!!!! Its a shame that people like that still roam around in them.  




 rofl  




 Yes  




 Shes hot.  




 No not the bees!!!!!  




 Yes thats what I was thinking those r considered the Golden Age of cinema.  




 Gibson is an awesome director hope he directs again soon!!!!  




 Sylvester Stallone tried to make a movie about him a few years ago but the studio cancelled it or something and he made expendables instead I read the script and thought it would make a good movie.  




 his gun and badge from when he was a cop.  




 Thats about right.  




 Cool 




 theres something I really didnt know 




 Yes  




 Yes watched it the other night great movie wish i had seen it sooner too.  




 Is it actually confirmed that they will be in the same universe???  




 Jennifer lawrence, Anne hathaway, Rosamund Pike, Zooey Deschanel, Emma Stone, Shaileme Woodley, Brie Larsen, Alison Brie, Karen Gillan,Hayley Atwell, and of course Anna kendrick  




 Yes he should.  




 Yeah its mostly with b movies man there is one i saw once where it is glaringly obvious LOL.  




 Thats for an actual scene in the movie In the movie a documentary crew was filming the reunion between the mom dad and son.  




 The Fault in Our Stars  




 I will read it wish it was being written by the master himself though. 




 WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Yes I wish they would make one already but disney has bigger fish to fry I guess.  




 Because they want to take away the shock factor of it. I also found it annoying how they announced them all the time.  




 NICE!!!!!!!!  




 I just saw it to man what a good movie.  




 Cool  




 Yes but who could play him????  




 Yeah true they could go with an older spiderman in the MCU if it ever happens though.  




 I forgot that scene I must rewatch it I guess.  




 marvel has already said IF they get Spidey the role will be recst, thats the one drawback I see if marvel gets the rights.  




 true
 hope its real tho 




 Star wars and Back to the future also Lord of the rings.  




 I liked Lone Survivor a little better because of all the action and stuff. Fun fact the main characters of both movies Chris Kyle and Marcus Luttrell were friends in real life, man what if they had tied the movies in somehow.  




 Id make The Mandarin the villain he was supposed top be. Just have Killian be the brain guy and have Ben Kingsleys character do everything including kill maya and fight with tony at the end. Also his plan is to start a world war by making it look like the president was killed by some other country or something.  




 AMEN Germany AMEN  




 OMG dude  




 All of em.  




 I just saw it and I enjoyed it a good little comedy tho like all comedies of course they showed all of the funny parts in the trailer.  




 After everyone and their mom has seen it.  




 Michales Proposal to Holly in The Office  




 I really wish that they had gotten the rights back for Spiderman how awesome would it have been to see Spiderman, captain America, and Iron Man all in the same movie. I hope this Infinity war rumor is true now that would be something.  




 HMM Ill check it out.  




 Who knows???? 
 




 Not atm, sad too I wish they would hurry up I want to see Rooney mara as Lisbeth again.  




 I need new audiobooks for work what are some good suspenseful ones???  









 LOL  




 It was an okay season better than coven at least but not as good as the first two, I was just happy that when someone died they STAYED dead this time. Also Evan peters got someone pregnant again LOL.  




 LOL YES!!!!!!!  




 Because shes russian.  




 WOW that is so weird I was just doing voiceoverwork!!!!  




 Malcolm Mcdowell just watch the Book of Eli.  




 Normally I will watch most of the major ones including all best picture nominees. this year I might take it a step further and watch EVERY film nominated.  




 I was literally about to post Gary oldman for the Professional good job!!! Another one I can think of is jack Nicholson in the departed he was so awesome in that film!!!  




 Yes I will never forgive the academy for that one, he was easily the best performance in that film and they nominate and give the gold to christoph walz who already had one for playing an evil version of that character basically.  




 A bunch of them. the Lovely Bones is one I haev caught every year since its release because that is my all time favorite movie.  




 OMG YES!!!!!
