 Forget muda muda muda, it's all about bang bang bang! 









 It's glorious ;_; I wonder what Dio's wrestling federation would be named? 




 *Highfives* while I love good reverse basses I've always been more of a [gated kick](http://youtu.be/YIrSN0UbgXg) guy 




 This the most unnecessary necessary thing. You will be remembered for this  




 I just googled "Jojo pose" but holy shit why isn't their any Jojo/WWE crossover art!? They would fit together so well 




 [*deep breath*........ AVANT GARD!!!!!!](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684413-1379684728-d4-screenshot-2.jpg) 









 Holy shit I died when he said chimichangas to go  




 and after we finish those delicious sandwiches lets go visit Leon's brother who lives in the cop car in raccoon city  




 I know what you mean, let's go out and get some Jill sandwiches  









 [Fuck the vita!](http://andriasang.com/comp76/my_sister_cute_and_popular/22mbf.jpg) I got a god damn cake DS 




 Ultrapancake I'm still waiting on that liam and woolie version of my neighbor totoro 

()  









 Passenger of shit will always be a weird entity. He has the ability and talent to make good music, but he just doesn't. As evidenced by his song [when the heart fails](http://youtu.be/bmU9tUZvk98), all of his stuff is the musical equivalent of masterbating with steal wool then shoving a jaged peice of metal up your dick  




 /b/ would go back and make "staple tapeworms to my penis" the world anthem  




 Delete did a great job with the samples in this 









 *pats on back, hands nuka-cola and psycho* "kick up your feet, uncap that bottle and dose up. We all make mistakes out here" 




 I really love the Therabyte voice. "Therabyte, we don't bite... hard *rawr*" R.I.P Therabyte :( /u/DjThera I'm interesed to know why Therabyte shut down. It had some good releases under its belt (Ironically Unknown 3) 




 A kick edit of stamp on the ground by the italo brothers (good song but in think it would sound great with a harder kick) 









 I can feel pats searing rage from here 




 LIAM LEAVES THE VENTS TO JOIN THE BRAWL! 




 Mines infernal imp, originally I was going to be blue sun but that was already taken and I didn't want to be blue sun_22 so I chose a phrase that was kicking around in my head, and that phrase happened to be infernal imp. I'm thinking of making another alias for speedcore and beyond called goreboy but I don't know if I will  




 [She sure is](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Sakuya_Izayoi?file=0cc71930fa6b2c7a02cfdc9560885e51.jpg)

EDIT: Should be all good now! 




 [no but shut up though](http://www.gamekyo.com/images_1/dc1911acd82cec0147111f1bd0ea6afd20110627173443.png) 




 Oh ya, I totally forgot about the touhou fighters  




 I mean lolis shooting at eachother, also damn good music 









 I know I want to do somthing music related and I want to learn about mastering and mixing and from what everyone is saying I wont learn about that in collage 




 Ok, I am a junior in high school who is looking to become an audio engineer and reading this freaked me out :(. What I'm getting from this is I should look for an internship and find a place that has a good engineering program?  




 For sure! 




 I played Jojo allstars battle royal yesterday! It was ok :( the movement felt bad but it looked fantastic and they got all the little details right, it sucks because Jojo is a great concept for a fighting game 




 Two degs  




 Sweet I'm all for story telling... I'll check some of those out 




 It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied 




 I fucking love Jojo so much. It has shown me that I can love anime! It also got some bad tastes out of my mouth (fuck you elfen lied)

P.S. I can explain why I don't like elfen lied if you want me to 




 Metroid metal.... Woa man 




 I mean you could post that, it sounds super awesome! But what I'm looking for is stuff that samples the ziabatzu, like taking little audio clips of them and putting it into a song, also covers of the theme. You know things like that :)  




 I like to believe that shaq's head is filled with marshmallows and chocolate, he is truly a national treasure...   




 Silent hills..... =( oh please I want to see the town in my dreams  




 Post music that is a remix, mash-up, cover of anything zaibatsu related! We've been getting some good music lately [I'll go first with somthing I made](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/ginger-breaks-wip)

P.S. I'll try to finish this sometime, although it's going to be be a little tricky since I lost the project file :/ 









 Lets see.... /u/trollabot audiofrq  




 Exilent (   ) 









 Holy shit 100 comments per month!? I was expecting less 

Also Hardcore is one of my most used words.... Perfect  




 /u/trollabot test_subject8320

Let's see what we get... 




 I'm working on a very super secret special project and I need some liam vocal clips, the first one shouldn't be super hard to find just him talking about Japan, the next one might be a little more difficult I just need a clip of him saying "rain" bonus points for anyone who can find me a clip of him saying "tea". Post links and time stamps I can rip the audio my self :) thanks in advance! 




 [Like this? :D](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/ginger-breaks-wip) also yes this is by me 




 Maybe throw up a spoiler for that pic dude 




 Hey Darude! What do you think about hard trance? More importantly have you ever thought about making it? 




 I've seen Thera comment at points, same with Atmozfears  




 Angerfist = Floorcrushers (only did one song though)

Thera used to do Hard trance 

You know what, how about we all list artists with other aliases just so we know! 

Audiofreq = ~~BL1K~~ BRK3, Bioweapon, Orbit1

Activator = ACTI

Geck-o = Geck-e

Shingo Dj = NATP, Round Wave Crusher

Zatox and tatanka = Wild Motherfuckerz

DJ Hidden and Eye-D = The Outside Agency 

Christan from Art Of Fighters is part of Meccano Twins






 




 You could try some good ol' fashion crossbreed. The Outside Agency and Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) are two of my personal favorites, as for hardcore to hardstyle a lot of Endymion's tracks bridge that certain gap. I would recommend their track Mirror Mirror with Alpha2 (it is rawstyle though) 




 Now that is a movie I would watch! Coming this summer... David Hayter is Big Dog 




 "This is dog"

*David hayter grunt/startled noise.wav* 




 Up top to the pasty white dude bit brother! Hopefully we'll see some lesser known genres gain fans in the near future (hard trance 3) 




 This kind of bell/chime sound [it starts right at the beginning](http://youtu.be/mSulcjw9OOM) it's from the song rock that beat by the Highstreet Allstars  




 I understand were you coming from man I'm the same way when it comes to anime, I've never really liked the whole harem story trope. On a diffrent note check out "Jojo's bizarre adventure" it is one of the HYPEST animes out their! I'm talking guys with the mussle mass of bulls punching each other and fighting vampires. Plus the main villain Dio is one of the best villains out their, he is an asshole and he knows it, and at times you will laugh along with him because he's just so evil. Also any time any of the voice actors have to say an english word it is pure gold 




 Yep the one at the beginning  




 Sakura is fantastic for Asian strings 




 Val-Kilmer sounds really good, the synth is nice and the melody is catchy. For sure look into side chaining, it will make everything cleaner  




 The way the melody came in was a little sloppy, otherwise good job the actual melody was catchy and the kicks cut through everything nicely  




 His mix tape is hotter then 10 nukes 




 We should give this guy a name! Any ideas? 




 Thank you mods! Also can we have a button that plays a woolie sound clip every time it's pushed, if that's to much to ask for I understand :) 




 oooohhh, some of those sounded pretty good, thanks for this bra 




 Dude stop.... The vice can only get so tight  




 One of the best sample library peices of advice came from /u/noisestorm on Twitter (or reddit I don't remember) basically he made a folder of all the samples he made and some of his favorites from sample packs and deleted the ones he never used 




 When I get my computer back I am going to buy Sakura and I will send you the stems/FLP (if you got FL) and we will work on this togeather because I don't know a lot about trap! 




 Good sound design, especially that part around 0:13-0:14 it sounds really sharp. Make this into a full song please... Also maybe use a diffrent text to speech software, I've personally never liked the ones that come with FL, they sound kind of weak (Just my opinion! If you like them then don't let me get in your way) 




 *Tightens vice* 




 Thank you! I never considered taking it in a trap direction, maybe I could start it off as a traditional japanese song and then slowly introduce trap elements... Shit man I picked the worst week to send my computer in () 




 Man SWERY should do an AMA on here, I think out of every lets play fan base we love him the most 




 Wait, this is by the guys who made jet set?!? (I feel dumb for not knowing that) also yep, going to have to put a vice on my nuts/wallet until I hear how it is 




 I've seen these drums before but I never knew what they were called, thanks a lot dude! The drums could be used for "the coming of the storm" part 




 I've never really given them a good in depth listen, when my computer gets back from the shop I'll have to give them a better listen 




 Yep, FL user! I have nothing against the FPC drums, I was just wondering of any other sample packs  




 I'm working on a song and I'm trying trying to tell the story of someone walking down a rainy street and going into a tea shop to warm up, I have the strings and rain now I need some percussion (mainly a good woodblock sound!) free or paid it doesn't matter, thanks in advance you beautiful people! 3 




 I understand what your saying dude, hmm it feels like I've had this issue with a vst before, maybe put a little more space in between the notes? (Sorry if I'm not super helpful my computer's at the shop so I can't really do any thing music related) 




 Digging the art style, reminds me a bit of king city, post what you think about it here! I'm always a little cautious with early access games 

Also for those who don't know! King city is a great comic that I stumbled across in a book store, I don't think the ~~ziabatzu~~ zaibatsu have ever talked about it but it seems like somthing they would really like, check it out if you ever come across it 




 So basically what your saying is sony is a giant tentacle monster?  




 Yep, I need a PC port of this, I am convinced I will like this a lot more then dark souls  




 Sytrus has a bunch of cool ones (especially the pads) I'll list afew vst's 

Sakura: sitar 1 (I love Asian strings!)

Harmor: I'm spacing on its name it sounds like some kind of synth that you would hear in a movie like blade runner

Toxic Biohazard: The underwater preset is pretty cool and dreamy

Serum: Any of art of fighters presets (he did a good job on them)


 




 sakura can recreate this (I'm pretty sure), it's great for oriental stuff and it might have a erhu preset (I don't know for sure because I've never taken a good look at the presets :P) 




 Definitely add some reverb to the harpsichord at the beginning, it will give it a better presence, otherwise no real glaring issues with this, keep it up I'm interested to hear what else you can do :)   




 Nice job on the strings dude! The intro sounds great and it flows very nicely into the drop, keep your head up man you did good on this :) 




 In most songs that sample video games, the sample is used once and it comes across as lame and not using the clip to its fullest potential, this on the other hand uses the sample fantastically! Checkout Geck-o (his other alias) if you want to hear more from this guy (sadly this is the only fallout song he's done) 









 https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/rainy-day-in-the-east I'm thinking of turning this into a full song, but im stumped on what kind of percussion would go well with this. Also I'm not super happy with the melody it sounds inconsistent and the progression sounds off (just listen and you'll understand), thanks in advance for the help :)

 Looking to get into hard house, I've really been liking it lately, also thank you to everyone! I asked about hard trance awhile ago and got a ton of responses. 




 Wow... This was Russian, the kick was a little quiet 




 ;_; "im hunkered down in this cave for the night, seems pretty standard as far as caves go, although I am hearing some strange noises coming from deeper in the cave, it sounds like a combination of buzzing and growling. I'm going to go check it out, it's probably just a bloatfly and a couple of coyotes," -Some dead Motherfucker (R.I.P) 




 I feel bad for laughing as hard as I did  




 The switches remind me of something you would see on a virtual synthesizer, like the virus swich or the dog meat knob  














 Yeeeeeeeeeeeahhhhh!!!!! (Pat or the csi voice you decide) 




 BURN THE HERETICS ON A HOT GRAPHICS CARD!!  




 This is so 80's that it hurts good find though  




 This might not be the place to post this, post this on one of the feedback threads or wait until we have another plug DJ night :) 




 I made [this big 'ol mess](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/fx-kick-reese) out of one from the blutonium hardstyle pack, also serum fucking rocks!   




 I would love to talk with him sometime, just get in his head and learn where he got some of the ideas for some of the more memorable platinum game set pieces  









 YES!!! /u/mike0dude please 




 thank you.... thank you so much! now all we need is for the mods to put this on the sub  









 Wow that doll is super sexy/hot/cute also holy shit I have never heard woolie make a noise like that, I really do hope this gets ported to PC 




 It's so cute 









 I messaged audiofreq and he sent me the radio edit and DJ edit, I should still go to iTunes for Hoo-ey  




 For sure checkout the JSHC, also checkout psycho filth records for aggressive stuff, if your looking for happier music checkout [Foryousounds](http://www.foryousounds.com) all anime remixes, completely free! Theirs also mob squad Tokyo and massive criclez. WORD OF WARNING!!! At points you will have to resort to torrenting, I beleve that you should support the artist when ever possible but some times theirs no other way! I'll PM you a link to were I get most of my japanese stuff 




 Aggred, good songs that are sadly broken and mislabeled, plus I'm still pretty salty about Hoo-ey :/. Also on the 2013 hardcore comp. a good chunk of the tracks were from the FREE "this is hardcore" album 




 This too  




 If you want a good titanic sci-fi thing watch that one episode of futerama  




 If you like hardcore checkout the Japanese stream hardcore compilations  




 *pats on back* 




 How will I remember to use the code ~~WoolirM~~ WoolieM now?! (fuck phone keyboards) 




 "I hear the guy from your yug-ge-oh? Is in it" 




 very nice dude! heres a patch I made a while ago (its not as good as yours but still) https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0 




 Yep, I might be wrong here but our boi woolie woolz used to do a little bit of modeling  




 But it will only be painless if we 
(Don't forget to use the code WoolieM) 




 I still need to check out the tidy shop so if it's not their I'll try out the torrent when I get home 




 Theirs no option to buy it :/ 




 Back in 2006 tidy trax released "Dark by design - The producer series //01" it was a limited edition CD that has long since sold out. So my question is where do I start if I want to find it/who should I ask? I know this is kind of a stupid question but I appreciate any help :) 




 God dammit heady :( 









 Do you need help getting out? 




 Woa! Thanks man, I'll look through all of these carefully :D 














 Usually I buy the comps. From cloud 9 but recently I bought the 2014 one and it's safe to say I'm done buying from them :/  









 #it's not Phil's fault, blame his parents  









 Holy shit that hank hill one, their were a ton of good ones in this  




 Yo super serious question for you shitlords, would I like this game? I played about 50 hrs of darksouls and I was only able to ring the two bells  dark souls was pretty fun but it felt like their were too many instances of banging my head agents a wall, also I didn't really like the art style of DS, this on the other hand looks pretty cool  









 Sure thing dude! Expect to see more on here later today 




 Alek Szahala, he's a Finish freeform producer, a lot of his songs are acid influenced, I would recommend his song Darkstar  




 My boy from Finland! I love him so much, back when I was into dubstep he was on the top of my list! 




 It sucks that a lot of HT artists are going subground. I love subground but I love HT more 









 Yo could I get a episode number and time stamp on pats indigo prophecy thing, mental disabilities kind of resonate with me because one of my family members is mentally disabled  




 *Sigh* oh the ziabatzu let me count the ways I love thee, 1. You always make me laugh, 2. You make me love things (I am now a mgs fan because of you chuckle fucks) 3. I started liking anime more 4. I realized the glory of Japan because of you and 5. You have gotten funnier over the years. Now what I would do if I ever met you, Matt: I would watch a action movie with you and your wife and then look at your action figures with intent and ask you questions about each one, Pat: I would talk horror and computers with you until the sun goes down then comes up again, Woolie: I would have you guide my hips and teach me all about fighting games I would also buy you a new mic because seriously dude and Liam: I would watch anime with you and after we finish watching you could tell me about how great the vita is and I would then go out and buy one. Also being super serious /u/mike0dude should be in a video or be on the podcast he is the true MVP of this sub, Mike keep up the good work you beautiful SOB 




 HFS MAN! Thank you, looks like I've got a lot of listening to do 




 Thank you! Got anymore for me? 









 Hello /r/Trance! As the title says, give me some suggestions! I am open to anyone/any kind of trance. Also let me tell you what I listen to normally, I love the harder side of music so hardcore, hardstyle, hard trance things like that I've also noticed that I love music from 2009 (those old hardstyle melodies are one of the things I live for) thank you in advance :) 




 What would be the team names? The space chodes vs the woolie boys? 









 Resubmiting because this got taken due to mod suppression /s (I broke rule 2) 
I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene
