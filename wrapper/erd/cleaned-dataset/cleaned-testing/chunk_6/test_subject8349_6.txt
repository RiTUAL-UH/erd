 Not working... "need authorization"  




 Eurotrip. Like... 3-4 times? 




 Illuminati confirmed or are these types of open directories common? :p 




 Kraftidioten 




 Well I managed to get poorly translated English subtitles for [Kraftidioten](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2675914/) in some shady subtitle site, so it could be worse... I guess.
Haven't watched the whole movie yet but it seems kinda nice. Weird, but still. 




 True. Nothing's worse than some antivirus software deleting my scene crack/keygen collection.

 Heeeh, a bit too short. I would have liked to answer more questions :) 




 ... I can't see it. 




 Lol don't even get me started on YIFY :p All of their 1080p releases have bitrates of ~2000 Kbps. Pretty much every 720p scene release I've ever downloaded is at least twice that.
Although I traditionally prefer scene PC-ISO/apps releases too, as protections get tougher some stuff is either gonna take a VERY long time to be released, or won't be released at all, thanks to their rules. Some fine examples of that are The Sims 4 and the new Dragon Age. This is where 3DM and their friends come in with their v6 crackfixes 'really workz now!', but well, it's better than nothing, I guess.
And well, I think SKIDROW has failed me more than P2P (Far.Cry.4-SKIDROW) :P 




 I love when 3DM or some other P2Pers release something, these fake blogs publish it and people are like "omzg skidrow juzt released crack for futball managor 2015 thx so much skidrow u r da best". 




 I really wasn't expecting to get so many replies, specially with so many explanations (I read all of them).
First, [here's the Google Form's summary of the responses.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AU3sEVFAlJ9kpGZkkZjrxPlZx2tGoI_hxxgURzWl0Ac/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics)

I noticed that it just had the names of the countries and not a graph. So I made [this interactive map.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CC6VcZIpSAF5Jq0ScFTX1j_dPiiGa1_RDUXjGa95mRc/pubchart?oid=528833391 format=interactive) 

Some interesting stuff (keep in mind that there's not as much data on non-Americans, non-whites and females):

* 64.4% of the USA participants think their country's dominant race will become a minority in it.

* 14.3% of the females would not have an interracial relationship, while only 6% of the males wouldn't.

* 78.4% of non-hispanic whites like being the race that they are, while this is only true for 63.3% of the participants of other races.

* "Propaganda" was the least popular factor of influence with an average of 0,83/4, while the most popular was "personal experiences in real life" with an average of 3,155/4. 

I also made a word cloud (using [this)](http://www.wordle.net/) with the words in all of the explanations you guys gave, [here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/QEIPSP8.png)

Finally, [here is a copy of the raw data in spreadsheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PqQb7pyPrXcdoHD8kbF_4R8xdB8kWIJarvHTeeVywck/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks to everyone who was a part of this! :)
 




 I gotta start paying more attention to what I'm doing :/ 




 You guys mean the survey or the actual speech?
If it's the speech, I'll be one of the last of my class to do it, thanks to the alphabetical order, so it could take a few months. I could tell you guys how it went but I doubt by then you'd still be interested. But I'll be sure to publish the results of this survey when this leaves the front page or something! :) 




 I'm gonna give a speech for my Portuguese class which focuses on racial issues. This survey takes like 2 minutes if you're in a hurry, but more if you decide to explain your opinions. Thanks everyone :) 









 Damn this is awesome. 




 The door wasn't wide open. According to my parents, they left it closed (not locked). The trust we put in society was extreme, and yes, leaving the door open was a stupid mistake. But isn't invading someone else's house and taking away what's theirs much worse than honest people who would never do that forgetting to lock a door? Yes sir, we're the "cancer". Now I must go, though. Gotta support these people's welfare and their drop-out kids :) 




 My parents used to go to the supermarket thinking I would close the door when they left. And I usually did, but  one day I had my ear plugs on as I was studying, and didn't hear them leave. After a while, I seem to hear some small noise. I open the door and there are 2 filthy gypsy women in the kitchen. My heart starts racing and I pretend I believe their "oh we thought this home was for rent - or is it your neighbor's?" bullshit, as I'm physically weak and don't want trouble. One of them asked to go to the bathroom while the other one kept developing that fake story. When my parent's arrived, besides cleaning the toilet, they noticed some gold stuff we had (like necklaces we've been offered at our birth) had gone missing. 
Now I'm just hoping the government decides to cut welfare for these pieces of cancer. But I doubt it, in Europe we love supporting those who not only do nothing for us, but also damage our lives :) 




 I don't think that could have happened if you bought in the actual G2A website (not some phish crap) with PayPal, while using a PC with no malware. Not sure if G2A allows actually entering your credit card without a middleman like PayPal, but if it does and you did it, it was quite dumb. I bought BF4 Premium from G2A months ago and it worked, but I paid it with Paypal (Paypal credit from a bank transfer, not credit card, though). 




 This deserves gold. But... you know... not in this economy... 




 dice pls 




 I'd suggest lowering the the texture quality, but wow, you have a Titan. Does it stutter immediately after you start playing or only after a while? If it's only after a while, it might be a memory leak. 
Also, try changing the settings to "Maximum performance" in NVIDIA's control panel. And the texture thing, just to see if it makes any difference. 




 Nice one, will you publish the results once it ends? :) 




 I photoshopped a friend's ID card so that he could enter a night club. He said it worked. Oh, and I've cracked a few programs. 




 RELOADED has been releasing stuff under "DOGE" (like Goat.Simulator-DOGE). They just name that DLL for fun. You can clearly see it's part of the uPlay emu: http://i.imgur.com/XnhvAPl.png 




 Until 1 or 2 years ago I don't recall ever having problems with FPS stutters. Everything always worked fine. 

Now all of a sudden it seems that new games start to stutter, even though I upgraded to a GTX 760 (not top of the line, but hey, I get enough frames per second with it). Watch_Dogs, AC Unity, Far Cry 4... I know they're poorly optimized crap, but still, there are people with similar graphic cards who don't suffer from it. 

Does this happen to you?
 









 Dude complaining about i5 3570 and here I am with an i7 920 :/
 




 How did you make that glitch happen? 




 I think this happened when I had installed [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler). I fixed it by opening it and closing. But that's probably not what's happening with your PC. Try checking if you have your firewall on, and if your Internet connection is working properly. 




 Server name pls? 




 Create a retirement home for old porn stars. 




 Poor teammate :( 




  [OP] Objective Pushers Obliteration 

Ah, I'm adding that server to my favorites. I saw tr1plex, Yay_Dogecoins and ONYXGFX on then feed, so I thought it was SAS.
