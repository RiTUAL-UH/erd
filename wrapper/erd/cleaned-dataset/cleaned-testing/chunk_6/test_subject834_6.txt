 I'm guessing that you would be in the atmosphere, maybe you can be the first person on mars? 




 I want invited to these week long orgies, how do I do it? 




 They also say that autism is "on the rise". When It's not really on the rise it's just that the diagnosis is much wider now than it was in say, the 80s. 




 I don't get them from the street anymore. I get real prescription stuff mainly because there's an abundance of them in my house because most of my family have prescriptions. 




 Imodium is an opiate that just doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and acts primarily in the gut, but the thing is, it either works really well, works too well or doesn't work at all. It doesn't feel consistent, but maybe that's just me.  




 I've never understood the argument that vaccines cause autism. If that was the case wouldn't most of the world have autism? 




 Hello everyone I'm new to this subreddit mainly because I didn't have much to post about. I have IBS-D (most likely, still need to do a little more tests but that's my diagnosis right now) and I get extreme relief from opiates, mainly morphine and codeine. The relief actually feels like a cure, when I take them I have no diarrhea whatsoever (mainly because opiates cause constipation but constipation for me is a relief), I still have chronic nausea and stomach cramps though. The only problem is that I'm not prescribed these meds, but they're easy to come by and make me able to function. If I try to come off them I would probably go to the bathroom around 8 times in 7 hours and I would have to take sleep meds to get any relief from that (if i didn't have any morphine or codeine). 

Anyway, my question is, is it possible to get prescribed these meds for this type of condition?  




 But they're still essentially the same as the other atypicals.  




 Antipsychotics will produce the opposite of euphoria.  




 I've never known anyone that's white to take offence to being called a "white boy" or a "cracker". Maybe if it's more complex racism but not one word.  




 Why the fuck is it that only white people can be racist? Can't black people be racist too? It's so fucking stupid, if I hear someone thats black call me a white boy or cracker I'm gonna play the race card because that's also racist. Also, why do black people get so offended when someones mildly racist to them? I don't get offended if someone's racist about white people. 

I'm not being racist if some idiot thinks that I am. If everyone wants equality (which I've always fully supported) then we should ALL get treated the same at the basic level.  




 I would've said, "Fuck you, you're racist too", to the teacher.  




 So what do you say if he wasn't american? What about a british person that's black? Do you also say African American? God damn, people are so dumb and stupidly sensitive when it comes to racism.  




 I've heard about the CBD recently. It apparently sounds good for negative symptoms as well, hopefully they finally try it out in a few years.  




 First horse burgers now deadly erection spiders, god dammit Tesco.  




 I was wondering that because the medications used for schizophrenia right now aren't exactly the best (albeit they are better than the very old style antipsychs), do you think they'll be new antipsychotics in the next 10-15 years, or are there already some in the making? 




 God dammit, she's a dumbass.  




 Could ebola not go endemic because of this outbreak (especially if it's not over soon)? 




 I think this is a very informative sub reddit. I like the posts here but I have a question... Who's serious? 




 Thanks, I've saved it so I'll read it a little bit later.  




 Thanks. I'll definitely do that.  




 So I haven't played minecraft since beta because I've just been playing other games basically and I've just started up a world and was wondering that there is a lot of changes that I don't particularly know about. Any tips and information anyone can give me about the new game? Remember the last time I played was mid beta. Thank you! 




 He looks so grungy. I like it. 




 If you could understand context you'd realize that I was being distant and just not dismissing him, I wasn't exactly trying to fully diagnose him it's called not being dismissive of someone.  




 Yeah it would be cheaper because amphetamine paste is just mix amphetamine salts like adderall but it's less pure. It's basically the stuff you got in the 70s and 80s. 




 Yeah it might not be your goal but if you had the option you would do it (if you were a sociopath) right? Also, look into narcissistic personality disorder or just narcissism (since you said you like talking about yourself). It co exists with antisocial disorders.   




 I have read up on the topic of a lot of personality disorders. Sociopaths usually have little to no emotion and empathy. They have little to no guilt for the wrong things they do and they think people are there to be exploited and oh, I don't watch TV either, that's so 15 years ago.  




 Alcohol is neurotoxic and CAN cause alcoholic brain disease and dementia. Alcohol is definitely worse for your brain and no, it's not different for a teen because you're just a different age not a different species. 




 [This is what he means.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity) 




 They were trying to plug it.  




 Why would there be a market for a less pure amphetamine? Adderall is basically just the same except it's more pure and you know exactly what you're getting.  




 I never used to get mad on opiates until I got addicted to them. 




 That doesn't make sense. Sociopaths usually don't recognize any fault within themselves and will only say they are if they can get something out of someone.  




 When I was taking ritalin I used to just snort the shit out of it. I would go up to 200-300mg in a day. Amazing drug while it lasts but when you come down it's metal as fuck.  




 I was even taking ritalin medically and I still felt the recreational effects initially.  




 Amphetamine is pretty recreational lol. 




 Why do we still have street amphetamine? Because doctors don't prescribe dexedrine or adderall as much as they do in the states so it doesn't get on the streets as much.  




 Yep, in the UK street amphetamine is speed. I've never actually heard or seen of anyone using meth in the UK.  




 Ants are gonna be Sched 1 soon.  




 Do you mean prozac and sertraline?  




 90c? That could cook my chicken. 




 I can't find EpicScale in my programdata, I uninstalled uTorrent. Is it possible I could have the miner still? 




 But why is it always in the Ritalin? /r/Conspiracy 




 I've been off them for a bit now and I'm fine. I'm more inward recently but that's about it.  




 My appetite isn't exactly great lately so I know I'm not over eating (well right now at least).  




 Holy shit, I'm on a vice article.  




 I've stopped taking my seroquel because it made me tired all day until it wore off 24 hours later (I took a controlled release version), but not only that but it made me gain 80-84 pounds (not just seroquel but the other anti psychotics I've been on in the past year). I've been off of it for just over a week (I know, not long at all) but my weight is still not back to normal, it's essentially still the same. I've been walking quite a lot (hard exercise is hard for me right now, just got bloods back saying that I've been pretty anemic and I have a stomach condition). I got a pedometer thing and It says I walk around 3-4 miles a day and I've also not been eating much, just lunch and dinner and maybe some chips, that's it. The only days I didn't walk much is when I got sick a few days ago but that was only for 2-3 days. I've not been losing any weight at all, I'm still between 235-238 pounds. Is there ANYTHING I can do? I've came off my anti psychotics because they're starting to just be a waste of time (yeah, yeah, I know, they "helped"), I walk quite a lot and don't eat more than 2,000 calories and at the most I eat around 2,500 calories. I've posted this here before and people didn't think it was possible, but yeah, whatever. I'm starting to lose it here, coming off anti psychs haven't helped (yet) and I walk and eat right and my weight still isn't coming off and my docs don't want to hear it. Is there anything I can do?

PS; If anyone doesn't believe I walk around 3-4 (maybe 5 at the very most) miles a day then I'll take a screenshot next time I'm out walking.  




 ##DID I DO IT? 




 One of my favourite movies. I even live in Scotland.  




 You're pretty much right. It's just an opiate that binds to the mu opiate receptors in the gut (just like any other opiate under the sun).  




 My dad is (was) an alcoholic and he's had to stop now mainly because he's developing a form of dementia that a lot of alcoholics get, luckily the thiamine has helped but it doesn't help everyone (he's not even 60). 




 I play CSGO (taking a massive break right now because it gets extremely boring) I'm a pretty high rank and I see what you're saying. Toxic players are so fucking stupid and annoying, I have one dude on my friends list who just rages because he dies (even if we win the game). 




 He seemed like he was actually bullying himself lol.  




 Tell them to fuck off (literally say, fuck off) and stop faking remorse, fucking losers. And PTSD from breaking up with a boyfriend? God damn, fuck that family they seem like a pathetic bunch of losers.  




 Have you seen a cirrhotic liver? Looks like a pickle. 




 Well alcohol can literally pickle your liver and give you a form of dementia, I would say its 9001x better.  




 Depends on how much you take and how much you drink.  




 I've got pretty bad "negative" symptoms (mainly not washing for days/weeks and not wanting to do anything other than sit in my room on my own) still but doctors NEVER ever take a look at it for some reason so I'm stuck not being able to fully function while no one really understands why and scold me for it.  




 It happens in the UK just not at the same rate as America. As /u/Fillyhaze said, the younger the doctor is in the UK (or Canada) the more likely they'll prescribe something, it happens much more often with psychiatrists in the UK than other doctors though. Psychs are often the most corrupt.  




 They're pretty much the same thing but certain people like to say psychopath or sociopath. I just got used to saying sociopath.
 




 Real narcissists (Narcissistic personality disorder, which most peoples parents in this sub reddit actually have) are also sociopaths, they can make anyone believe them or like them.  




 After reading a lot on this subreddit I've came to the conclusion that narcissists are so fucking stupid and self centered that they don't even deserve human interaction.  




 So they're literally committing crimes against humanity, in a way? 




 You should leave, really fast. You'll either crack and kill THEM or they'll end up hurting you or worse, kill you. They're extremely abusive and bad parents.  




 [This is how much receptors they act on. The ones that are blank for efficacy are basically antagonists](http://gyazo.com/f32f36ce833a74312e3b2498e2f2a45a)
6-7 are agonists partially, but most are antagonists. So it's definitely not just one or two receptors, so doctors that tell you that are probably just mistaken because they're not exactly pharmacists or pharmacologists.  




 Seroquel will calm you down a lot more. Heh heh. 




 If you don't mind me asking what autoimmune disease(s)? 




 She said that her sister thought it was in Japan.  




 People either never take enough codeine (180mg-120mg) or they can't metabolize it into a working drug because they don't have the enzyme or insufficient amount of the enzyme.  




 I didn't exactly say that he isn't damaging it, he's obviously mildly damaging it but the other dude said that he's "KILLING" his liver. I don't exactly think he's killing his liver with only 900mg over the recommended limit.  




 You're right, my mistake. When you're constantly studying this shit you often mistake an agonist for a releasing agent or a reuptake.  




 Was just about to say that lol.  




 I don't itch from opiates as much anymore. I used to scratch really bad but not that much anymore. Tolerance can play I role I believe.  




 best answer. 




 Every time I do CWE's I don't get as high. You should still do it OP, maybe you're not as dumb as me. 




 I wouldn't say he's KILLING his liver with 4.9g a day. 




 Money.  




 I've had ritalin controlled release that was just little balls that didn't have much wax or fillers and was really easy on my nose. Depends on what kind he has. If it's concetra then don't just crush it up and snort it, that's probably the worst for snorting.  




 Either way, benzo withdrawal can kill you. It's just like alcohol withdrawal but arguably not AS dangerous but it's still in that ballpark and should be treated with care. If he was my patient and he even called me all sorts of names and shit I would still taper him before just letting him go.  




 Oral ritalin doesn't really do much other than for therapeutic uses. Focalin and Ritalin are only really euphoric when snorted. So try again in 2 days and just snort them. Are they XR or IR? 




 God damn pot head.  




 It's so fucking weird. You're chilled out and happy but you're also mad as fuck at the same time. God damn opiates, not even... wait, I'm doing them right now. 




 No problemo. 




 Opiates make me happier but god damn my temper threshold is so fucking low.  




 20-100 hours and 36-200 hours (for the active metabolite) is the HALF life. So if you take 20mg, after around 36-200 hours (usually it's in between those times) will go down to 10mg in your system. When I was taking lorazepam I was very happy and social for a week later.  




 I'm pretty sure it is but not to the extent of heavy recreational use of course. Amphetamines use a lot of dopamine and serotonin and pretty much deplete these receptors (thats pretty much why you come down) and someone who takes them every day for a few years would definitely have some brain chemistry changes. 

I remember being on methylphenidate (ritalin) and I would have to take breaks every weekend just to EAT, so if someone is not eating enough and basically starving themselves due to no appetite could that also damage the brain? Because I know that korsakoffs syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency usually seen in alcohol but can happen because of malnutrition too. (Legit question, even if it seems dumb). 




 Xanax is pretty much the exact same except its stronger.

Edit: Yeah, don't freak yourself out of course but using benzos for a year at any dose (even theraputic) can cause seizures. It's DEFINITELY something to think about and have a friend with you incase it happens, you know, seizures aren't always deadly, seizures kill you usually by banging your head or having an injury when no one is around not by the seizure it's self. Honestly, seizures are the worst physically thing that can possibly happen but it doesn't mean it's set in stone. Just watch out for the mental stuff, you'll be cool though. 




 If you can survive benzo withdrawal - then you can survive anything

You're right. I've been through opiate withdrawal numerous times and it seems nothing like benzo withdrawal. Makes opiate withdrawal a walk in the park and that's saying something.  




 Stims (methylphenidate etc) never really made me feel warm and fuzzy inside (or maybe I was too speedy to realize lol), opiates do that.  




 Since that's what it was prescribed for you could have rebound symptoms of PTSD (not related to withdrawal, but withdrawal will make the anxiety worse for sure since that's part of the withdrawal syndrome). If it gets too bad I would definitely call the hospital, they'll give you a benzo if it's bad enough. Your doctor should NEVER have done this to you, with any psychiatric drug (ESPECIALLY benzos) you need to be tapered slowly off of them. 

Edit: Remember, you wont get every symptom thats listed on the wiki, that's just a list of possible symptoms. If anyone got all those symptoms they'd be effectively dead lol.  




 Yeah lol. 




 If you've been taking it for a year religiously then it is a concern for sure. [This will tell you all the withdrawal symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome). Seizures are pretty common with benzo withdrawal, it's kinda like alcohol withdrawal. 




 Yeah, they use them in hospital when someone comes in having a seizure.  




 Does he realize that benzo withdrawal can induce, seizures and kill you? Medical negligence. You should taper, yes but have someone with you incase you do seize or worse, nearly die.  




 Even if it is rare, it still happens. Rare =/= never ever happens.  




 It requires dropping out of elementary.  




 And they should be reminded every day that they DID kill someone.  




 Those dispatchers should have been charged with some sort of murder or manslaughter and sentenced to a minimum 21 years.  




 It's a phenothiazine, basically an old style anti psychotic kinda related to thorazine in a way. There are a few (mainly old I believe) antipsychotics out there with anticholinergic effects. It isn't accepted as an antipsychotic anymore since it's pretty bad at being one but it does have those properties, mainly mildy blocking some serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors.

I remember taking it to get to sleep a few times and I would have audio hallucinations and feel really confused. Thank god it's not used as an anti psychotic anymore.  




 The comments on YouTube by those fucking trolls really piss me off. We should shoot this operator in the head and ask her a bunch of questions for 6 mins before getting her help.  




 I would wait for sure. LSD and Psilocybin act on serotonin, particularly 5-HT2A (which is a serotonin receptor). 




 Sexy.  




 Someone with severe anxiety or even just moderate anxiety and they take a benzo they'll definitely feel a "high" but the high will just be no anxiety. Maybe most people in our society feel pretty anxious and when they take benzos they have absolutely no anxiety and put it down as a "high"? Who knows.
