 After only reading the title, I came here to bitch about that story being cool but not funny... Then I saw the picture. 

You won this round. 









 This, my friend, deserves an upvote! 




 Who are mostly Catholic that need to go to church... Do they kind of became 1st rudest again?

 I think you need to have given birth in order to have a IUD implanted. Not positive, though.  




 Excuse me... A human. I don't see how it is fair to take that HUMAN'S life. I have been in the "young and irresponsible pregnant girl" place. Now I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter. It isn't my place to have decided whether or not she got to develop from some cells into an actual baby. I wasn't ready to be a mother, but I figured it out.  Honestly, I had to grow up quickly... But I would never go back and change it. I will NEVER agree with abortion. Sorry if you don't agree with me.  That is the joy of being a human and not just a clump of developing cells that doesn't get a say in anything. 

Rant done.  




 Yeah... What a weird hobby. Trying to save an innocent baby's life. SMH.
