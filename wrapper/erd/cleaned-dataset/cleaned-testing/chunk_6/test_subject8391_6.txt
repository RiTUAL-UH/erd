I don't know why they chose 4th grade for sure, but it's an age when they kids are young enough to still love exploring, but old enough to also appreciate the wonder around them...it seems like a good age to target for their goals. 




 All the national park [annual passes](http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm) are remaining the same price -- this is by far the best deal for visiting national parks and by getting one, it encourages you to visit them more. 



















 They have announced they will be giving away the free passes, but won't actually do it until the beginning of the school year. By signing up (no need for a donation), you'll get the notification when they begin giving them out. 









 Pinnicles is the newest US national park. You can learn more about the California Condor program [here](http://www.nps.gov/pinn/learn/nature/condors.htm) 














 As part of the Open OutDoors for Kids initiative, the National Parks Foundation wants to connect kids with the wonders of our national parks and the natural world through the Every Kid in a Park program. Open OutDoors for Kids believes national parks are the perfect place for kids to learn and self-discover the wonders of nature. As part of the initiative, they will be giving out a free national park pass to every child in the fourth grade for the 2015  2016 academic year, and will include entrance for the family of the 4th grader. The link will put you on the notification list to get the pass when they become available.

 This beach is actually quickly disappearing. It used to be difficult to get to, but they have opened up a new walking path that makes it easy for anyone to get to it, and the result is that the glass is disappearing as people take it home. If you want to see this beach, you should make plans to get there asap. The glass beach likely won't be there in another 5 years. 







































 Thanking people for the work they do. 

I started doing this about 2 years ago because of a friend. I noticed everywhere she went, she would thank people for the work they do. We'd walk into a fast food restaurant and some person would be mopping the floor, she would stop and thank the person for keeping the place clean and safe. Walking down the street and some guy holding up a caution sign, she would thank him for helping to keep people safe. When we would be out hiking, instead of just saying "hi" to the rangers we passed, she'd say "thank you for the job you do. It's greatly appreciated"

The vast majority of people work very hard at what they do and never get recognized for it. You'll be amazed at the surprise and the joy people have when you recognize their hard work. It's simple, doesn't cost anything and it will likely make someone's day.

 None of the warehouses are better than shopping sales. What you do get is a consistently decent price if you usually pay retail at other stores. I think the main benefit of the free pass is to go and see if the membership makes sense for your situation. I don't think you're going to come away with huge savings. 



















 USA: there are so many it's difficult to pick one, but if I had to, it would probably be  [The Wave](https://www.flickr.com/photos/frip0895/6226999382/) 









 Hit the national parks in Utah if possible: Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capital Reef, Arches and Canyonlands. And if you really can, try to get a permit to visit [The Wave](https://www.flickr.com/photos/frip0895/6226999382/). Would love you to share your trip over at [r/nationalPark](http://www.reddit.com/r/NationalPark/) and would love to help out with any other questions you have about national parks on your trip 















































































 Yes, when you go to Sam's Club, they will fill it in when you present it at customer service desk. 




 They charge an additional 10% (except for excluded states) than member prices when using the one-day pass. It's a way to get you into the store to check it out without having to buy a membership.
