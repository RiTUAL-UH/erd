 Devarim - Deuteronomy - Chapter 28:6

You shall be blessed when you come, and you shall be blessed when you depart.

The Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a says, the way you 'depart' from the world should be like the way you 'come in' to the world, just like you 'come in' to the world **without sin** (blessed), so too your 'departure' from the world [should be] without sin (blessed)

but that does not seem related to adam and eve.

The Talmud seems to imply that people are not born with deficiency's from prior sins including Adams

But like I brought before, the Tchebiner Rabbi has a different interpretation for the Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a





 









 Relating to the discussion if people can be born with a deficiency

Superficially this text seems to imply that one can't come in to this world with sin

There's a famous RaShaSh on this

   

(This RaShaSh is very controversial and some believe it's a forgery)

The [Tchebiner Rov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Berish_Weidenfeld) refutes this and argues that the  passage actually is proof that one CAN come in to this world with sin

            ,        "     " :                         **    **  .     ,   ,                      ". 




 According to the latest exit polls, President Obama lost the Israeli election  




 that people are born with deficiency 

The Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a seems to disagree

 Russian bots on Nemtsov's death

 he's making shit up


What..

A bipartisan probe is being launched by a U.S. Senate Investigatory committee, designed to look into the funding of a not-for-profit group that has been trying to oust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

-

New Israel Fund and its social change and political lobbying organization - known as SHATIL - have received more than $1 million from the State Department under a program designed to create political change, reform, and activism in the Middle East.

-

 OneVoice Movement, a group in Washington which has received $350,000 from the State Department. Until recently the group was headed by a veteran diplomat from the Clinton years.

-

A subsidiary of OneVoice is the Israel-based Victory 15 campaign, itself guided by top operatives of Obamas White House runs, which seeks to replace the government of Israel.

-

Jeremy Bird, Obamas previous campaign director, arrived in Israel to help direct V15, which was trying to reach a million households in an effort to remove Netanyahu. OneVoice is prohibited from directly targeting Netanyahu, but its Israeli partner V15 can carry out the campaign.

 The study was conducted in 2008. See the links I posted. ISIS is different.

FYI: Most 9/11 hijackers had college level degrees or higher 




 Terrorists are pissed off and excluded. The profile is very similar to workplace shooters.

Statistics show otherwise. Most terrorists had college level degrees or higher and an extraordinary high amount majored in engineering.

Most were successful people.

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

 Is there any plans for re-float the wrecked MUSASHI? 




 In case anyone is interested.

It wasn't until December 1944 that the sinking of the Musashi was confirmed through prisoner interrogation. 

From World War II War Diaries. [Image (last paragraph)](http://imgur.com/uYgFaDq) 

Reports of prisoners of war interrogation on the South-west Pacific indicated that the MUSASHI, new Japanese battleship, had been definitely sunk in the Sibuyan Sea by THIRD Fleet carrier attck on 24 October. The reports also confirmed previous sinking claimed by the Commander THIRD Fleet and confirmed extensive damage to the remain-ing Japanse battleships which were now either in navy yards under repair or operating at reduced efficiency.

**Julie Sheldon, who swam at 9 weeks, now plays under water at 19 months**

-

In 1953, when she was only 10 days old, Julie Sheldon of Los Angles was taken into a pool by her grandmother, Mrs. Jen Loven,  and given her first swimming lesson. At 9 weeks (left), already established as the youngest swimmer in the world, Julie could swim for distances up to 10 feet as her grandmother walked closely behind (LIFE, Jan 18, 1954).

-

Today, an accomplished swimmer of 19 months, Julie has also become an underwater baby. In the outdoor pool on Hollywood Boulevard where her grandmother keeps toys resting on the bottom in the 4-foot depth, Julie submerges for as long as seven seconds and intently plays with everything from a tricycle (above) to a teet-totter.

 **What were Bone Records?**



Bone records, or roentgenizdat, were music recordings on an unlikely medium: discarded x-ray plates. During the Second World War in Eastern Europe, vinyl became an extremely expensive way of producing records. Therefore, during the 1930s and 40s, the lack of available materials caused both labels and individual music enthusiasts to search for new ways of production. Music became available on all types of wax and film, but most notably photographic film and x-ray plates. The plates were favored because of their thicker density.


Demand only grew in the USSR in the 1950s when records and tape recorders were in increasingly short supply and music was growing as a necessary escape from political tension. Young people in Eastern Europe realized that they could duplicate records using a converted phonograph and create an imprint of a record on discarded x-ray plates. Used x-ray plates could be purchased for next to nothing from hospitals and medical facilities once they were no longer needed. Then they could easily be cut into discs with scissors. Altered phonograph machines using wax disc cutters and machines like the voice-o-graph could produce grooves in the film that were nearly undetectable. Soviet society promoted science and technology and search of knowledge. It was often students who were studying engineering who would be the ones creating these records.
Termed rock on bones (rok na kostiakh) or rock on ribs (rok na rebrakh), the records became a visual symbol for underground Soviet resistance and rebellion. The quality of these bone records was not very good at all, but the price was right. They were rather flimsy and would warm and break easily, but they would only cost a ruble or two.
In 1950s Russia, women usually controlled the family budget. On a days lunch or drink allowance, one could purchase an underground pressing. Better quality recordings would require a week or twos worth of allowance.

**Music Censorship in the Soviet Union**

In the years after World War Two, Stalin tried to get rid of any American influence on Soviet civilization. His first target in the 1950s was American jazz music. Artists like John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk were never to be heard by Soviet ears.
Jazz music turned to rock-and-roll and Bill Haleys 1954 Rock Around the Clock was deemed a threat to civilization. The x-ray press system was discovered by the Soviet government in 1958 and was promptly made illegal. The same was true for the samizdat, which was the self-publishing means for writers.
In 1962, a Soviet paper in Lithuania said of the Beatles and Elviss music: These pearls of Western culture are part of an imperialist state policy corrupting the masses, promoting low animal instincts, and dulling the mind. Similarly, in 1961, an East German newspaper said that Chubby Checkers Twist was being used by imperialists in West Germany to rally the young people for war.
It wasnt only the records that were censored by the Soviet government  rockbands were disbanded and rock concerts were raided. A task force of music patrols was started by the government in 1959 to control illegal music activity and the largest ring of roentgenizdat production was broken up the same year.

-

**Melodiya**

Melodiya, the only official record label of the USSR, was founded in 1964. Melodiya produced mainly classical music and recordings of famous actors, as well as records with fairy tales for children. Melodiya had firm policies against protest rock. They later produced records of many of the pop and rock artists of the 60s and 70s, but not until years after they were originally released, and at an extremely high mark-up. Melodiya was state-owned until the fall of the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.

-

**Government Response**


The Soviet government attempted to flood the market of bone records by creating unplayable records in an effort to kill the demand. They would either make records that would physically mess with players, or the would include vocal recordings in the middle of the music saying things like, You like rock and roll? F**k you, anti-Soviet slime! There were about 10 individuals who were suspected of distributing bone records who were sent to the gulags (the Soviet labor camps).

-

**The Music**

The most popular productions were Western artists  from early jazz to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. Soviet rock artists such as Yuri Shevchuk ran into problems with the KGB. Melodiya produced an official record by the band Aquarium that was only approved by the label as a reaction to Western concerns in USSR censorship.

-

**Death**

The two main factors in the disappearance of bone records were the government reconciliation and the replacement technologies. As reel-to-reel tape recorders gained in prevalence in the 1970s, they were able to successfully replace the system of x-ray recordings. The x-ray records had an extremely poor sound quality and were produced by select individuals. Tape recorders provided a better quality with easier and neater production. One source called tape recorders the Bit Torrent of the 1970s. At the end of the Cold War, during the perestroika era of restructuring in the USSR, censorship of music lightened up and the need for underground production of music died.

X-ray records were metaphors par excellence of imaginary elsewheres  the ingenious experimental cultures that were both internal and external to the body of the Soviet state  Alexei Yurchak, Everything was forever, until it was no more: the last Soviet generation

 When people write about the phenomenon, they tend to focus on rocknroll, but a lot of Russian music that people had grown up with was also banned. Theres a Ukrainian singer called Pyotr Leshchenko  a Russian emigre who specialised in South American tango and gypsy music. After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately. You had popular Russian tunes that were classified as criminal songs, but they werent really. They were just regarded as low culture.

 They just changed the words "steps down" on their site to "quits". Sounds more accurate...
