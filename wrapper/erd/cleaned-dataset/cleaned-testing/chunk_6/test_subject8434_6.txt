 Allegedly  




 Are they still available? 




 They use a Nokia to film this? 




 She 13 I'm 13 














 They both have exclusive content tho so wouldn't they draw different audiences regardless kinda like how fox and cnn work  




 I have both, they have two very different shows so why are they competing with each other? 




 That's it, that's the deal  




 How much is that in American? 




 Wow 




 Ya we should put a program that doesn't allow any tolerance in school! 




 A friend is a friend tho  




 I believe you're shooting in proper it used to happen to me 














 Not bad for a night out. 200 each person? 




 Thinking about saving up one day and buying it, how much are they?  




 They refuse to switch mine out for security reason which I understand  




 They have hung up on me twice so far and it's been 3 hours I wouldn't be so mad if it wasn't a waste of 100 dollars 




 I bought a 100 dollar psn code from 7-11 and the code didn't work so I went to get a new one and the refused because of security reason and so I'm on the phone with sony for about a good 3 hours and they refuse to refund me because thy can't validate my code.  














 My mom is trying to figure what the name of this movie is and she can't get. It's about twins one not and one girl and the boy is evil and the daughter is apparently an angel. She says there's a cliff hanger at the end and that there is a second movie out or coming out finishing the story. 




 20 dollars for every game?  




 Good day for you isn't it  




 Play both, and ask your coach for aid. Sense your a senior I'm sure you already applied for colleges so senior year is that important grade wise. 




 I'm in high school and I know plenty of people that are but maybe it's one of the laws that aren't really enforced  




 I don't believe it is I know a kid sponsored by Nike and his very known within the region 









 What does that mean? 









 How do you get the beta? 




 You bastard you could have put the summary at the top  




 I'm curious of this too 




 I guess respecting someones religion doesn't exist tho  




 I was hoping for a clean sheet  









 For me to be able to do the deal do I have to buy the tickets online or can I buy it at the stadium?  




 Maryland sorry
