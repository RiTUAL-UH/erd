 I am, but the clickable area is razor thin.  




 My dad used to have boxer shorts that said " faded glory" on them. I can't think of anything sadder.  




 Having a hard time upvoting you on mobile. It's like trying to thread a needle.  




 As a sales professional I disagree. My job Is to direct you towards the best product for you personally. That's the product that will give you the most happiness for a price you can afford. If sales is done properly, everyone wins. You leave happy with your purchase and I earn commission. People who inflate prices artificially or lie about the performance of a product hurt the rep sales professionals everywhere. 

I don't have to lie to you about a product. I just have to tell you that the one with the features you want is more expensive. You buy it or you don't. That's on you. 

Lying about the amount money Jobs brought in wasn't a dirty salesman tactic. It was straight up theft.  It came right out of Woz's pocket.  




 Any suggestion for cold or frozen cables?  They seem impossible to coil properly.  




 Being able to create a separate profile for kids that can be customized to limit their web access and device options... I'll be replacing my iPad with one. 




 I completely forgot that I recently joined this sub. This is amazing.  




 Tony, my wife met you at a common friend's wedding.  She says you're the bomb on the dance floor.  That is all.  




 I smoked for about 12 years, smoking a pack a day at the end. I quit the day that my wife moved in. She wasn't going to put up with any shit and that made the decision to quit easy. There was no hiding it because she was living with me, and the temptation faded slowly. I still get the rare craving, but it's only for a minute and then it's gone.  




 I'm late to the conversation, but this is worth mentioning. 

I was raised Catholic and went to church all my childhood, but after moving a couple of times I had pretty much stopped going to church by the time I became an adult and gradually lost a lot my beliefs over time.  Recently, my wife and I were planning to start attending church again since we now have a young daughter and we felt it was important that we raise her Catholic like we were. I went out and found a church for us.

At the new church I felt a connection with the deacon immediately. He was charismatic, energetic and "modern" for a church deacon.  He even baptized my daughter himself.  He was arrested on charges of distribution and PRODUCTION of child pornography mere months before she was enrolled in his Sunday school.

The thing that gets me the most is how comfortable I felt handing my child over that monster.  I'm done with the church now, not going back there or any other church.
