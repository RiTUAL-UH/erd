 *This city...* 




 Yeah? What about all the comments in other day's post about the leg with lymphedema? Everyone was reacting saying this wasn't laughing matter, that it was a nasty disease that could happen to everyone, some even insulted op for taking the photo... Don't take me wrong, I agree with all of that, but the level of hypocrisy was strong, this sub has been laughing about other people's disgraces since a long, long time. 




 Add fire. Lots of fire. 




 It looks like a penis...  




 These are amazing. X-post them to /r/HeavyMind, they will love these. 




 brb 




 Death here. Please **do this**. I reccomend DNRs as well, if you help me I'll help you. 




 That was fucking awesome. 




 What? 




 I just hope those aren't pubes 




 Anal gay sex with penises?

 Trust me, you're not missing anything.

 Once I saw my nephew play skyrim spamming e on all dialogs and reading nothing. I asked him if he did that because he already knew the quest dialogs to which he responded "nah, I just skip to the killing part".  

I should have ended his life right there. 




 Thanks so much!

 Getting that "Elvis has left the building!" Bonus. Such glory. 




 They are GTA hookers. They accepted terrifying death the second they were rendered. 




 Huh, I thought that was how PRIME95 stressed CPUs, by doing simultaneous prime number searchs with that "2^prime_number - 1" equation, and then that other equation to check if they are primes. 




 I over analised that joke. 




 Why not? 




 It's a large prime number calculation also a method? 




 I will. Mad love frient 




 thanks man 




 Man, I wish I could play games high. I love skyrim and GTA V, but whenever I play them high I just lose track and keep forgetting what I was going to do... I love space engine though, but I don't know if that counts as a game [3] 




 /r/upvotedbecausegirl 




 And then a guy posts a leg with lymphedema and everyone got SJW saying that that wasn't laughing matter, that they wished OP never got that, that it was very rude taking a picture of it... Which they are all true, but come on, it's /r/wtf... You can't laugh your ass off about a 14 year old murdered and then claim humanity in a rotten leg. Jesus Christ. 




 Hands down one of, if not THE worst subreddit out there.  




 Yeah, I wouldn't want to be this guy's hand either 




 *tips rabadon* 




 To be fair, you did said it "wasn't 100% illegal", which isn't true... It's still illegal, only that the punishment is much lesser for those quantities. 




 I love this one! Which lens did you use? 




 Thanks so much! She's gorgeous indeed :) 




 -- Dear diary...   
-- u wot m8 




 I agree with you 100%, but it's true that in the other hand this subreddit has been making fun of people's deaths and weird diseases for a long, long time. Of course that doesn't make it right, it's wrong and we shouldn't take pics of these things, but this is the basis for this sub from like ever and it just seems off to me that suddenly everyone is offended by it. 




 This sounds like a horrible condition, and from what I read here it truly can happen to anyone. Are there some measures to prevent this from happening? Any activities (such as smoking, just for example) that can cause higher chances of developing it? 




 how 




 Whatever, it's actually a good quote, in this case the message is more relevant that the messenger.  




 I don't know why, but those 200 grams seems like a lot of weight for DNA only! It's incredible. 

One quick question: do we have DNA in absolutely all of our cells? I mean, I know there are very different types of cells, but is DNA present in all of them? I'm sensing the answer is probably yes, but I though I'd ask :) 




 Exactly that. He said he thought it was his aunt Maria, that he has money, that he doesn't need to steal. They are Chilean if I'm not mistaken. 




 Thanks a lot! Their eyes are incredible, I agree. It's pretty hard to portrait them right, but I like the way they came out in this pic :) 




 Ha, don't we all! Thanks so much for commenting! 




 Thanks a lot!  




 Thanks! :) 




 Thanks so much! I'm super glad you loved it! 




 It was a 50mm @ f/1.8, I'm not on my computer now to paste the settinga but I believe I used ISO 400 and 1/80s 




 Thanks so much! I was patient and let her do her thing, eventually the pic came through :) 



















 Reddit can be shitty sometimes, but whenever in true need it's community proves from time to time that it's one of the most supportive, empathetic and amazing groups of all Internet. I'm crying from all the kind words I'm reading here. It's truly overwhelming. Thank you all, incredible people. 




 Define "gold" 




 I totally read this in Mcconaughey's voice 




 That's some alpha shit 




 I'd like to contribute with a simpler example, I'm sure he will get it after it.  

I threw a party. My parents promesed me they would gift me one apple for every friend that came. Unfortunately, 0 friends did, so, how many apples do I have (*or 'how many apples did my parents gave me'*?). The answer is 0. 




 Jeez, the guy was asking a question, where's the need to downvote him to hell? 




 Not for mobile! At least not in the Android app with default settings. I'm glad I got to read it though 




 Misogyny? Since when little female dogs are human females? 




 I like you. Keep posting 




 If? 




 No, "m" with that accent means something close to "myself" (as in "he called me" = "me llam a m"). The translation to "my" (of poseession, like "my car") is "mi", without the accent on the i. Trust me, it's my native language. 




  "if you have kids, and you cheat on your spouse, you are also cheating on your child".

Wow, so much truth. I'm left speechless.

 




 Then floss again to remove all the tiny bits of semen. 




 Arr lmao 




 Nah, you're not an idiot, it was a very understandable mistake. Mobile formatting sucks sometimes.  




    mind  
   
   blown   




 I don't either, and it's amazing how many people finds that shocking. Nowadays it seems that most people believe that if you do something but you don't post it on Facebook, it's like haven't done it at all. I mean, it's a fucking website... 




 Otra buena es "entendiste o saco los tteres?". 




 Eh, props to the girl. The guy came out waaay too strong but at least it wasn't those "pic of tits pls u whore fuck forgive me... tits pls" so she replied to it very clearly stating that she has absolutely no interest in so much weirdness, but in a respectful and funny way. 




 Thanks a lot! I like the color contrast as well. 




 I love this show, but that's really fucking weird. 




 We do tons of p2p evaluation here. 




 -Hey me, you aren't really god at anything  
-Fuck you
 




 Yeah, you're right for the most part, except for the meaning. Yoyo would be I-I, that's correct, but me means "m" (pronounced "mee"), not "me". For example "it happened to me" translates to "me pas a m".

 We're all on the same boat. The safe option is to install a pirated copy of GTA V on another folder or hard drive, but spending 65GB more only for modding doesn't seem much of a solution. 




 The second line makes sense. He states first that x equals y. He then says that x times x equals x times y, which is correct given the first statement.  

Let's assume x = 5. If x = y, and x = 5, then y = 5, so 5^2 equals 55, which is x^2 =xy 




 Think of the people that have Google fiber, 1gbps. That's insane, I has dial up 9kbps when I was a kid, I don't know how many times less that is (I'm almost asleep, is that nearly 3 million times faster?). Technology evolves at an amazingly fast rate. 




 Thanks! Indeed this is a lens effect. The lens in question is a Nikkor 10,5mm f/2.8 **Fisheye**, and I bold that because those are the type of lenses that have this particular bending. They also make far things seem smaller and closer thing bigger. 




 I'm pretty sure the majority of us that complain about FoV didn't get banned for modding. 




 I'm sorry, I expressed myself wrong on the title, it's a bit late here haha. I meant to say he was trying to light a cigarrete with the hot end of that iron rod. 









 I hope you do! Please notify us when such.  

I followed your advice and posted another one here haha. I don't post much of my work on Reddit, maybe I should, there's a potential for great constructive criticism. 




 Wow... I became a photographer because of my love to visual arts and that I can't draw even a smiley haha. I'm super glad the world has such talented artists as you.  

If you scan that, you could make it a great wallpaper. It's super super good, keep drawing and improving always!  

BTW, I got you gold, your work totally deserves it and even more. Please, don't stop drawing.

 




 Hey are you that disapproving face guy from the subreddits? 




 I believe maximum in Spain is 40 years, which is a country of the EU. 




 Yeah, not really. 




 He ded 




 Ugly faces and poor judgment 




 Your source.
Me: mom. 




 What very true story did he tell? 




 You cheatist. 




 He's just saying that getting those 10 extra years doesn't mean that playing Russian rulette will be 100% safe, you may get shot in the head and survive as a vegetable for many more years, and that would super suck  




 Phew, dodged that bullet, we almost got civilized there for a second 




 Quick story.  

In 2012 new years eve a couple of friends, my gf and myself were walking home after a night out, at maybe 5-6am. They were like 15 or 20 of us. Out of the blue a car comes at 60ish MPH towards us, breaks and turns over repeatedly, hitting just with the tail one of my friends. Luckily it wasn't a serious injury (the car barely touched her) but it looked like it at the moment with all the commotion. We head towards the crashed car and got out the driver, who was a very drunk teenager. We called the cops and after they showed and took him, we got home. It was a very scary situation, we almost got killed and we returned as if nothing happened. 

But I remembered hearing the name of that teen when police asked it to him. So I searched him in Facebook, in Twitter, anywhere I could find him, with no luck at all. 

A few years later a friend and I were hanging in a bar near my home. Having a great night with some girls we met there, and one introduces us a group of friends of her. In that group was this guy. I remembered him very clearly, and when he said his name I said that yeah, I knew him, "you almost killed my friends me and my gf in new years eve". Man that was awkward, I don't know why I said it, it just came off me like that. He got very angry at first and after a lot of tension and discussion (he wanted to fight me, wtf) I told him we should drink a beer and talk privately. We did, and I said I didn't want to fight him, I just wanted to know if he was conscious about what he did that night, that he wasn't a murderer by the luck of a few inches.  

He cried and told me he hasn't been able to drive a car since, that he remembers what happened that day everyday, and that he was very sorry for what happened. I just felt that he was being sincere, so after a while I told him that at least me forgave him, that it was all cool. It was a powerful moment, I felt so much anger when I looked at him at first, but then we talked and I don't know, it felt great to hear him say that and it helped me a lot to forgive him as well. I haven't heard from him since, but I hope he stays well and that he never drinks and drives again.

OK, not so much for a quick story haha so, tldr: guy almost kills me, friends and gf in a DUI car crash, casually met him years later, tells me how hard that experience hit him and how he hasn't been able to drive again (morally of course, laws in my country sucks, as my English so sorry for that). 




 I don't care what kind of moral crusade you're on, or how justified it is, it's just weird to talk like this to someone.

Moral crusade? Not at all. Maybe it'd be a moral crusade and a bit weird if someone called them out for no good reason out of the blue, but this person is talking about becoming an Uber driver... People should know that their driver killed (not injured, *killed*) another person while driving drunk.
