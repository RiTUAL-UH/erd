 Thankfully the MC isn't your typical harem lead.

You'll see when it is adapted. 




 Domestic na Kanojo is by the same person as Good Ending. 




 I just started playing the game on Friday and today was the first time that someone interdicted me. What I don't get is that there wasn't anything on Comms and I was able to put full pips on ENG and boost away without any issues. They didn't even try to go after me... \\_()_/
 




 I've been interested into getting a space sim game for a few years now. I backed Star Citizen back during the kickstarter but it has been a few years and not much to show for it. I tried EVE, but I felt as though it was too complicated and too far along for someone new to join, but I enjoyed playing it.

I've read a few reviews and watched a number of gameplay videos and I am wondering if it it worth getting.

In Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review, he likened it to a space Euro Truck Simulator and I enjoyed ETS2.   




 Even as a DPS, I've noticed stuff like ST and what not filling in ~5 minutes or less. 

I can't wait until my WAR is high enough of a level to do dungeons with the so called insta-que. 




 The OP stated in the title that it wasn't on the scanalators website or on Batoto. They did as such before you posted the comment. 




 The part from the light novels is pretty lengthy but funny. Here is a snippet from volume 2 about it:

 Ah, if it isnt a Starbucks! So there was one around here, thats great, its been a long time since I drank a latte!

Does it really look like a Starbucks? Thats a

Hm?...What?...Eh?

As they got progressively closer, Amis head became progressively tilted with suspicion. Certainly, the sign looked just like that of the North American coffee chain. The round shape, the green bordering, the somewhat indistinguishable humanoid image---

Th, this is

---But that image was of the old man who owned the shop.

Sudou Coffee BarWe usually call it Sudoba 

Another thing regarding Sudobucks but this time from volume 4: 

 "Welcome to Sudobucks" As the female college student workers voice resounded, a faint voice whispered within the shop. By the way, this place is Sudou Coffee Bar. There isnt a "bucks" anywhere in the name. 


Don't ask me where to find it. Try searching online for it or something. 




 When I went it was Mahouka and Black Bullet. :(

 




 [Yoake Mae Yori Ruriiro Na](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1543/Yoake_Mae_yori_Ruriiro_na:_Crescent_Love) is special to me because while it was cliche, the series goes farther than most romance comedy anime out there. 




 If they do decide to disable abilities I hope they keep Bard's swift song. It allows me to get around faster. 




 It is taking the [tsundere trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere) and applying it to sharks.

The best example of tsundere for people who haven't seen anime would be Helga from "*Hey Arnold!*". 




 He/She has done some stuff in /r/anime before as well. 




 As a heads up, you are requesting not suggesting an anime. 

Suggesting on here is, basically, the same as /r/manga's "Read This!" or /r/anime's "Watch This!" tag.

I have changed your tag and approved your post.

---

On another, note you might want to look at either getting an account on an anime tracking website such as MyAnimeList (MAL) or Hummingbird. This will help people see what you have already seen and scored and give you shows to watch accordingly. 




 Yeah, for that matter we tend to get the chapter before Japan due to leaks. 




 WARNING: While it is marked appropriately, the above spoilers are for the latest manga chapter. 




 Nope, I managed to get a Raspberry Pi 2 for $37 with a case.

[Amazon Order Page](https://i.imgur.com/zQxdsFg.png) - (Personal information has been censored)

Actual Product: [Box and Pi](https://i.imgur.com/26RVsaN.jpg), [Closeup of the board](https://i.imgur.com/a9R1puk.jpg)

I'd link to the page, but I guess the realized they could get more money if they made it into a kit. 




 I was able to get both an RPi 2 and a clear case for $37 with prime shipping about a week ago. The price quickly went up from that to $48 which isn't too bad since it included a case. 




 [](#lewd) 




 I love arcades, but sadly there isn't anything nearby for me and the last one closed about six or seven years ago. 

---

I had the opportunity to go to Japan last May and they arcades there were thriving and a lot of fun. I played a lot of Groove Coaster since it was a fairly easy to learn rhythm game coming from *Osu!* and it had multiplayer. Not only that but it was three songs for 100 and if you failed, it didn't kick you off/out like IIDX.
I miss the SEGA and Taito Game Stations that I played at. The only thing I'd change about it would be to ban smoking, but smoking is pretty prevalent over there. 




 Like the others said I'd suggest that you get a MAL account or some other anime tracking website. It makes it a lot easier for people to recommend stuff.

---

Make sure you remember to flair your posts accordingly! You didn't have one, so I went ahead and added it for you. Please remember to do so in the future. (Otherwise AutoModerator will remove it after an hour.) 




 [](#lewd) 




 Nope, that is yandere. 




 Yep, you can.

For the OS you'd want to use Raspian.

The office suite should be LibreOffice which can use and save as word/powerpoint/excel documents and such.

For a web browser you might want to use Chromium. (Unless someone has a better option)

---

My concern is that your school's internet will block the Pi(s) and you won't be able to login into your network drive/space.


Not only that but you would have to set it up so that everyone has a login and someone would have to manage the permissions. 




 Check Amazon every so often. I found a listing for the Pi2 and a clear case for $37 with Prime shipping. I'd share it, but they increased the price to $48. (Which isn't too bad since it includes a case, which runs about $8-10) 




 I would figure that MLB.TV would HTML5 or something like that. I have never used it before so I have no idea. 




 The best bet would be to get:

* Raspberry Pi 2 ($35)

* HDMI Cable ($4-6 on Monoprice)

* Private Internet Access VPN (I've found that it works really reliably) $40 a year. They also have a [setup guide for a number of OS's including linux](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/).

* Micro-Sd Card ($8-12 since you'd only need an 8gb one)

* Power Adapter (An old USB Charger might do the trick)

* USB Keyboard ($15-30)

* USB Mouse ($10-30)

* MLB.tv subscription ($129.99 a year)

Setup costs: ~$260 (Includes both of the subscriptions)

Yearly after that: $170 (The two subscriptions) 




 Ignore the other guy. While I haven't read Re:Monster, I am thankful that you guys have been working on a number of light novels for people to read. 




 Hopefully one of the mods removed it since I reported it for plagarism. 




 I love how you completely, word for word, [copied my post from 8 months ago for the "How can I earn money on Rumble?" section](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/27sw0l/introducing_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/) rather than type up your own version of it. 

[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/hQ5mqMH.png) for when/if OP changes it. 




 Considering that I hadn't seen a '-' in an username before, I'm sorry. I'll edit it accordingly. 




 At least you got the username right... I got my head bitten off since I didn't see the '-' before his name because of the custom flair. 




 If you look, it is the mods of /r/anime adding stuff to people's usernames. His username is only /u/-Niernen

EDIT: Make sure you remember the '-'. The + version gets upset if you get it wrong. 




 I would suggest that you reread this after the first season. You think it is good now, wait until then.

OP got the characters' traits, personalities and behaviors down to a "t". 




 That is why you leave your web browser up with something on it such as Reddit or Facebook.  




 That would take 288.461 years to complete. 




 Tip for anyone who watches anime on their computer using Media Player Classic, press "b" instead of pausing and it will instantly pause and minimize your video. 




 It isn't worth it to get it onAmazon since The Pi Hut jacked the price up $10...

I should have jumped on it when I saw it... 




 Heck, the new Rasoberry Pi has 1gb of ram on it and a quad core 1ghz processor. 




 They shouldn't since only some states have online sales tax laws and even then, most of the time, it only applies if they are selling/shipping from the state you are in. 




 I was looking at getting one from them as well. Price wise, it is $5 more than getting it from MCM/Element14 since E14's shipping is $9.99 and you don't have to wait as long. 




 The first 25-ish chapters have a lot of fan service and that is due to the publisher asking the author for something similar to his previous work, *Love Hina*. He wanted to make an action manga and he had to transition it from the harem-y series. 

After that it is a great read and it is even better when you re-read it and realize all of the foreshadowing and hints that start from the very first chapter. 




 Don't craft, do leves. Around 25 I was doing the cornmeal leve like crazy. You can buy cornmeal from the Whistling Miller in New Gridania. 




 There was a vita release in Japan. Sekai Project is back porting the vita version to the PC since the Vita version doesn't have the 18+ content. 




 Grisaia already has a Vita release. Heck, the Pc version they are bringing over is a port of the Vita version. 




 Lancer always has the worst luck. 




 A trip to Japan. $3600 for two weeks including airfare, transportation, room and some meals. It was a lot of fun and I made a lot of good memories while I was there. I'd like to go back at some point of time and explore outside of Tokyo to see the countryside and other cities such as Kyoto. 




 As a heads up, bots aren't allowed on /r/anime unless they are approved by the moderators. 




 They are, effectively, banning their rc planes from flying within a 15.677 mile radius of the White House.

Area of a circle is "pi*radius^2" and 1 Km is 0.621 miles.

(sqrt(2000/pi))*0.621= 15.677 mile radius 




 Part of the reason why there is a difference between the screaming voices is that it is really easy for English speakers to pollute their vowels when sustaining a word. 

In Japanese they only have a single vowel sound for each vowel and as such it is a lot harder for the vowel to be polluted.

For an example of a polluted vowel, try singing anything that ends in -ing and try to hold the -ing. It gets polluted. With the word "trying" try singing it as "tryic" and hold the "i" vowel then add -ng at the lat moment.

 Manga Rock censors certain titles if you are in the US, partially due to Viz but also for content for whatever reason. 




 How about installing an ad blocker? 




 I haven't heard of those sites, but if you want to do surveys and actually get paid mTurk would be your best bet. I've made ~$1000 over the past three years of off and on work.

It is owned and run by Amazon and you get paid through Amazon Payments which you can either deposit or use to get an Amazon Gift Card. 




 I sort of miss Hayate's antics but I wonder how Ell will enter the harem considering she is a robot, yet alone one made by that professor. 




 One nice thing is that all of these characters are under the Dengeki Bunko brand. Dengeki is a light novel publisher. (Light novels are basically young adult fiction titles that have an occasional illustration setting the scene or mood at the time.) 




 From what little I have played of the arcade version, there is slight conversation scenes before the fights but I have no idea if they add a story mode in the console release.

Source: I played three games of it while I was in Japan back in May of 2014. 




 It was early because the 1.00 FW of the PSP allowed anyone to run code on it. (They blocked it in 1.5, but since people could already see what and how the system worked, it didn't take too long to get hacked again.) 




 While it isn't the vita, I opened my 3DS in Akihabara and got about forty to fifty streetpasses at once.

Portable gaming is a big thing over there. 




 Thanks for that, I'll have them send it again to a different email. 




 How long does it usually take for the recruit a friend email to be sent? I had a friend send their code through the form last night and I have yet to get it. :( 




 They make machines that generate white noise. The machines will be louder and cost a lot less to run overnight. I own one since I live in a dorm and the people nearby are loud and I live right outside one of the common areas. It has helped me sleep soundly on a number of occasions.

Make sure you get one that has an actual fan rather than being a speaker otherwise you might pick up on the patterns in the audio which will annoy you more than help you. 




 Please read the Spice and Wolf light novels. :D 




 I would relist and sell them. (Unless you need the mats) 




 Share button works for screenshots on the PS4. 




 I was in Japan for two weeks and no one else from my group was around to go eat and it was after most places had closed. (8pm!) I walked down a nearby street to find somewhere to eat and tried/worked it out so I could oder some food and I ate alone. 

Either that or the time when no one else around so I walked to Akihabara by myself to explore. I, barely, knew the language but thankfully I didn't have to speak to anyone. 




 Something something thank you for the suggestion. 




 Have you seen Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope)? They used rotoscoping for when the characters were playing music and it meshed really well. 




 Not really, but with enough cat videos on YouTube or NicoNico, they will be able to find the one close to what they want. 




 Actually, it wouldn't be too hard to do. They would just have to rotoscope a video of a cat walking for the realistic one and then animated it normally for the, well, animated cat. 




 There is also Eriri's use of alpha and bravo last episode. 




 It isn't entirely a 4-koma. There are parts where it is like a normal manga. 




 If you had read the article, this is now of the English version of the game. Japan had the crossover back in November. 




 It is an anime based off of the Disgaea games. The Prinnys are, basically, the lowest level monster/enemy/ally in the game and get a lot of crap for it. Heck, if you throw them in the game they explode! 




 There are two Final Fantasy MMO's, FFXI and FFXIV. XI has been around for over 13 years and XIV is the newer of the bunch. 

I've only played XIV, but I really really like it. (There is a free trial as well so if you want to try it before you buy you can) 




 I've been leveling a cul and what I have been doing is finding certain items that do not have a listing on the market and put stuff up for sale at a much higher price. I've been able to sell a low-ish level dish for 1250 gil a piece and the mats run ~200 per and if I HQ it can sell up to 1750 for the same item.

You can take this idea and use it with the other crafting jobs/classes. You might want too look at making and selling housing items as people always need furniture. 




 I think shard prices will go up a bit due to the one method, other than mining/grinding them, getting fixed. 

For those you wondering, you had to: 

1. Accept a triple turn-in leve that had a shard (or other reward bonus)
2. Turn in twice for the rewards
3. Abandon
4. Get the same leve again. (It used to keep the rewards as they were. If you were getting 48 fire shards per turn in, you could always get 48 fire shards per turn in as long as you did the above method) 




 I've love to win. It would help pay for my studies as I found out I have to go an extra year. 




 If you search on Bing for (30-90 searches which depends on the account and "status") while logged into an account, you accumulate points (15-30 per day depending on the account's status). After 450 points, when your account is "gold" you can get a $5 Amazon gift card.

It takes ~2-3 weeks to get enough points to get one, but you can have up to five accounts per household. 




 I use bing for the rewards. (Helps pay for my subscription too) 




 I haven't read the LNs, but my guess is that the transfer student is the girl from the first episode that Tor beat. 




 Just wish to go to Ezorzea in FFXIV after they add the gold saucer in update 2.51! 




 Zalarea is small in terms in population and there are some guilds (Free Companies) to watch out for such as Evil, but overall I've liked it and I've started to notice the same people while traveling around. 




 What server are you on? If you are Zalarea, shoot me a PM and I can introduce you to a really good FC that likes to help people out. (Heck, they've basically been there for me every dungeon that I have had to do. They've also helped me with gear and what not.) The people are really nice and they won't go after you for DPS issues or even getting aggro'd if you are a DPS. 




 I'd love to get that Key magazine/poster/art-book.

(It is in the left-most box and you can see "Key" on it) 




 Get triple turn in leve - Turn in two times - "Do it later" - Abandon - Rinse and repeat. 




 Try looking for turn-ins that you can buy from NPCs such as cornmeal if you are leveling CUL. 




 The best one I found was the level 30 Cornmeal leve in Limsa Lominsa. Go and buy cornmeal from the Whistling Miller in Old Gridania. Cornmeal is 51 gil x 6 per turn in and I was getting 48 shards per. 

On my server, fire shards go for 120-150 gil each. (Basically, the profit is about 5450 gil per turn in.) (I did ~40 levequests, which brought me from level 29 CUL to level 37 CUL and I got ~4200 shards from it all) 




 Sadly it is 300000 gil... 




 At least it isn't [DRR!](http://archive.uboachan.net/yn/src/1249719241125.jpg) (WARNING: Image is from *The Enigma of Amigara Fault*. It is creepy) 




 I did this a few times with my emerald/topaz carbuncle to make quests easier.

Another thing I did was just the rouge's hide ability to skip a large chunk of the level 10 quest rather than fighting. 




 Thank you for reminding people to use the appropriate flair! 




 Like /u/semajdraehs said, you had the wrong flair. You are **request**ing a show, not giving a show (**suggest**ing for people to watch.)

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair correctly in the future. 




 No problem! 

This is how I notice it at a glance since I have forgotten what little I learned from two semesters of it:

Hiaragana () - Curvy simple characters

Katakana () - Straight simple characters

Kanji () - (More) Complex characters 




 For those of us who use feet and inches, she is 6ft 1in. 




 Argh,  isn't kanji but katakana. 

 




 I'm new to subscription MMOs and MMOs in general. 

What happens to our subscriptions when/if the servers are down for an extended period of time? Does SQ not deduct a day or are we just out of luck for that day of the subscription? 




 Yep, getting 2002 error. :( 




 If that is the case you ought to read the light novels. The novels have been published in English up to, I think, volume 12.

The first season covers volumes 1 and 2. The second season covers volumes 3 and 5. 




 Well, I'll change that...

Wait... That is what you want us to think... 




 What server are you on? 

On the server that I am on, Zalarea, the FC that I am in, Heart, likes to help new players go through the content without rushing. Case in point, I am really new and they either ask around through the linkshell or their friends if they would be interested in running ____ dungeon with me.

I felt bad last night when I tried the daily roulette, we had a tank that was in level 50 gear and was running ahead but there was a new player. I felt bad that half the members of the party were speedrunning it and forgoing the experience and story that the new player was missing. 




 It doesn't even air in Japan until the 23rd so this is pretty early by Crunchyroll standards. 




 "Request" is the wrong flair for this, "Identification X" fits what you are asking better. I have changed it as such, but please remember to flair accordingly in the future. 




 As a heads up you'll want to flair this with the "Question" flair for this sort of question in the future. I have done as such for you this time, but please remember to flair your posts accordingly from here on out. 




 I know a guy that is really into Razer stuff. I'm trying to get him to use better headphones but no, if Razer releases it he has to buy it.

I don't get people some days... 




 If you are in the US and you are 18 or older, you ought to sign up for Mturk. 

It is run by Amazon and you can get Amazon Gift Cards by buying it through what you earn from Mturk. 

Personally, I've made about $1000 over three years of off and on work. There are times where I'll forget about it for spans of 3-4 months as college gets busy and I have to focus on that.

Some information from the sticky:

**[Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com)** [US ~AND CANADA~]

This site is a bit different from your typical beer money site. This is a bit more professional. You work for "requesters" and they approve or reject your submitted content called "hits." Many people here think this great and it often gets them more money than other sites. They do require more personal info from you than the sites above for tax reasons (even though you likely won't have to worry about it) and not everyone gets approved to work here.

 gt;   Age minimum: 18

 gt; Offers: Different tasks requesters want you to do for money

 gt; Payout: Amazon Payments balance or bank account

 gt; Referral Incentive: None

 gt; TIPS

 gt;  Dont use mturk without having [turkopticon](http://microwork-dev.ucsd.edu/) installed. Its a browser add-on that allows workers to post reviews about requesters and gives you a good idea of whether or not to attempt a HIT based on the requesters reputation.

 gt;  Only do hits that pay at least 10/minute. Mturk grind forum and /r/hitsworthturkingfor are good places to check for worthy hits.

 gt;  It is better to return a hit (it will not negatively impact you) than submit if you are unsure whether the requester will approve it. 




 [This](http://yokohama-theatre.com/en/component/comprofiler/userprofile/graigrussell) could very well be him. (It links to the Yokohama Theatre Group) I didn't find anything on MAL so this might be his first anime related work. 




 Yeah, that was really good English coming from the commentator in the beginning. Heck, they might have brought in a native speaker for it. Someone might want to check the credits to see who did the voice over for it. 




 I, personally, liked the anime but I have heard that Alicia is made to be more of a "[tsundere](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere)" than she was in the game. (TV Tropes warning)

They also kept the watercolor/colored pencil look of the game which is pretty interesting.

I'd say that if you like the game it might be a good idea to, at least, try the anime. 




 You might want to give some information and/or constructive thought rather than just linking to the MyAnimeList page for it.

 




 You can always change the flair by going on your web browser, even on your phone, and doing it like you would on a PC.

I have changed it as such, but please remember to select accordingly in the future. 




 This is a TV special, which is an OVA, and they tend to be fairly fan service heavy in order to have people watch/buy it.

My guess is that the main show will have a lot less fan service than this. 




 Best tip for this one is to figure out how to get airborne and then stay near the track. I made it down once but I had no idea where to go... :( 




 You can also use 7-zip, which is freeware, to un-rar a rar file!

On a related note, thanks for doing this! 




 thatsthejoke.jpg 




 What is funny though is that while they are having fan service, the characters are discussing the merits of said fan service. The entire thing, out of what I have watched of the episode, seems to be highly self-referential and sort of meta. 




 I would contact Amazon as that isn't acceptable. You paid for the 650 so you should be getting the 650. 




 I think it is a cultural thing. Case in point, while I was in Japan I went to Mandarake, which is a used anime/manga/cd/goods store and bought stuff that seemed new. Heck, I opened the Clannad OST and it had all of the original inserts and the only issue is that the box that holds the case for the trifold cd case is losing its adhesiveness which is something I attribute to it being 11 years old. The same thing for the Little Busters OST I got but there weren't any flaws. For that matter, it might was well have been new.

One of the professors I was with on the trip said that since there is the belief in the culture that everything has a spirit that it is to be treated with utmost care and this permeates their way of life. 




 You might want to look at the FiiO X1 or even the Sansa Clip. Both can play a lot more formats than the stock iPod Classic and you can even add more storage, up to 128 GB, through the use of a Micro SD card.

As a heads up, if you get the Sansa Clip, look into installing [Rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org) on it as it will allow a lot more formats and such. 




 That scene was in Angel Beats.  




 Not OP, but I have been to the Tokyo Anime Center before. Admittance is free and you are allowed to take photos but the use of flash is discouraged as it can fade the sketches and such. 




 I am fairly new, but this is my mentality:

* Need - When you know you need it for the current class or one that you are working on.

* Greed- When I'd really like said item.

* Pass - When I have no use for the item. I also do this once I get an item in the dungeon as someone else could use the loot.
