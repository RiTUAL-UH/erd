 The theory that I accept the most is that humans are actually the only species aware of type match ups. Because of this, Pokemon will ally themselves with a human to better their own chances of survival.  




 ...I'll allow it.  




 Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is somewhat similar, though it's a straight-up comedy, less than it is an action show. It's pretty similar in that it's also a sexualized parody of Magical Girl shows. iirc, the soundtracks are also done by the same person. 

Also, it's not really an anime, but Bayonetta is kinda similar. You might want to try out watching/playing that.

 Episode 4 was the one with the weird animation that introduced the Black siblings. You're thinking of episode *6*. 

And that was the joke. All the changes I listed were made in Lagann-Hen.  




 Gurren Lagann:

-remove that one episode where all the pointless side characters died to fill some space. (Not Kittan obviously since he was important, but everyone else)

-episode 4. Fuck. 

-shorten the "serious" arc where they were on Earth post-time skip

-maybe extend the final fight by like 7 minutes

-add a giant new form of TTGL made out of Kamina's soul

-give Yoko a Tengen Toppa Titty Tank

-maybe make it into two movies 




 Phoenix Wright objects to the fight! 




 Everything I can, except Smash Bros because I have the GameCube controller.

 I think that it's probably the coolest of all the forms of Gurren Lagann, but I can't find any related merch. Am I just looking in the wrong places? 




 Isn't that kind of the plot of every haunting movie? 




 I'm not an expert on the Mandarin, but from the thread it doesn't seem like a full-powered Bayonetta would have too much with him. At her full power, she took down both the god of her universe (or at least, its presumed creator) and the man who was nigh-omnipotent by stealing the full power of several gods. The only thing Mandarin can do to harm her is going to be the matter manipulation, which Bayonetta has overcome before with Jubileus and Aesir. The speedblitz could be an issue, making Witch Time a bit less effective, but in the Balder fights in Bayonetta 2 she's already proven that she can fight enemies much faster than her. 

Bayonetta wins.

 Kaworu as a Jesus figure always impressed me, because up until I realized that I always thought the show just used its Christian imagery in part for shock value, without very much subtlety. It was then that I realized the show is much more clever than I initially thought with its religious references.

 Remember that these are real humans as opposed to the impossibly optimistic and masculine Simon and Kamina.  




 They seem like they'd be pretty cheap and easy to make, but I've never really done anything like that, so I have no idea where to start. 

If I were to make a pair, my main concern is how I attach it to my face. It just seems to be a shape carved from some tinted plastic, with nothing to rest on except the bridge of my nose. And speaking of tinted plastic, what's the cheapest/best material to make it out of? 

If I buy a pair, then where do I buy from? 




 That's not how that works.  




 I would really like it if they released volumes 12-14 as one big "End of Evangelion" Omnibus, considering they are the volumes that correspond to the movie.

 Madoka Magica is very similar to Evangelion, while still being different enough to be enjoyable. 

Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't exactly an anime, but it's the classic sci-fi mindfuck and Evangelion does reference it a lot. 









 Global strikes again! 




 Perhaps Mari will reveal the truths she knows and those will end up motivating him, making Mari not fucking worthless? 




 Well, time to preorder

 Evangelion already exists though 




 As long as she doesn't swear during her combos (and honestly, her shouting "fuck off" during a combo was kind of out-of-character anyway) she'll probably be fine for the game, considering Palutena has a pole dancing taunt.  




 Not only that, but African Elephants exist in the Pokemon universe as well. They're mentioned in one of Gastly's pokedex entries.

 I think Cosplay Pikachu should actually be a clone of Pikachu who can transform between the five costumes, similarly to Shulk.

 I thought the shit was meant to go in the toilet.  




 My favorite character is Bayonetta. I have Counter Vibration, Wing Blades, and invulnerability. 

Thing is, my invulnerability will mean that I get a good ninety or so years to fight Bayonetta. I'm to weak to ever hope to do any damage to her, unless I was able to become a witch/lumen sage, in which case I'd eventually be able to wear her down enough to beat her. Knowing Bayonetta, there's a good chance she'd just get bored and leave before I was able to wear her down.  









 [So, Ash Williams vs John Mcclane](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/276/9/b/death_battle_idea_81__ash_williams_vs_john_mcclane_by_777jaylee777-d6p1b2n.jpg)

I've only ever seen the first Die Hard, and from what I can tell John Mcclane is a relatively realistic protagonist. His feats aren't as over-the-top as, say, winning a war against an army of Candadian Demons led by your evil skeleton twin. Ash stomps every day of the week.  




 I think the generally accepted explanation is that when party members "die" in battle, they really just pass out. Then when everyone passes out, they actually end up dying. A Pheonix Down therefore couldn't save Aeris because she wasn't injured in a way where she could come back.  




 Arceus also loses its omnipotence.

 From there we have two options: either Jake and Amir, and subsequently the subreddit, fall into obscurity and we all move on, OR we are promised more Jake and Amir (either renew the webseries or TV show confirmation) and we go the route of /r/rickandmorty until then. Though if it *is* the latter, not much will really change, will it? 




 I'd like to nominate Terminator 3 as a sequel to T2. It's not just that it's a bad movie from a different director with a poor premise. It's that its very existence undermines the story and themes of T2. 2 was a movie about defying fate and forging your own path to the future, the success of which was unique for what is, at its most basic level, a prophecy movie. T3 tore down the accomplishments of Sarah Connor to nothing more than a setback for fate. After watching T3, I could barely even enjoy T2 again, knowing that their struggle in that movie was ultimately pointless. 

So a sequel that actively ruined the original, that's why I think Terminator 3 is the worst.  




 Does anyone know if the Yarn Yoshi will be compatible with Smash Bros? 




 I had a theory that Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are two sides of the same story. [I posted it here a while back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2xfjsz/evangelion_and_gurren_lagann_tell_the_same_story/)

 I agree somewhat. Beauty has no weight limit, as long as it's proportional to their height. I'd be fine with a 300 pound girl as long as she's 8 foot 6.  




 I really liked the anime and movie (though they did remind me of Evangelion quite a bit) and I was wondering whether I should pick up the manga. Like Evangelion, it seems the manga has some subtle differences that might make it worth reading. Should I bother? 




 The End of Evangelion, because it is literally the ending to the TV series. It was what they intended before they ran out of money. It also happens to be one of the greatest films ever made in my own opinion, so absolutely check that out. 

After you clean your brains off of the wall behind you, you may want to move on to the Rebuild saga. 1.11 is a remake of the episodes until the fifth angel, 2.22 deviates into its own story, and 3.33 is completely different.  




 I though it was the one from Cabin in the Woods.  




 It's as much Shoujo as Evangelion is Shonen.

 We all know that in order to beat Spiral Power on the level of STTGL, you'd need to be no one short of Revelation Jesus. But is there anyone on the other end who can defeat STTGL by flying under the radar for long enough to take out the pilots?

From what I can gather, Simon is the only pilot that matters, and everyone else is basically just a Spiral Power generator. This would mean that anyone who can take out Boota, Yoko, or any of the insignificant side characters, can cripple it at least back to TTGL. But who's the strongest who's weak enough to take STTGL all the way back to five-meter mode? 




 Me so fucked up... 




 I didn't see that. Yeah, Mewtwo just has too much to deal with in a horde battle.  




 Didn't Ash become homies with God himself during one of the movies?

Regardless, I'm actually going to say no. Ash has had a lot of powerful friends (just about *every* pokemon that wasn't available except by events, what a coincidence!) but he has very little battle skill, next to no knowledge of matchups (he seems to bank on Spiral Power rather than strategy). Even if Ash had all this, Mewtwo is insane during his time under Giovanni. Ash has no chance in a one-on-one, regulation Pokemon battle. Mewtwo is the closest thing Kanto has to a demigod, and no single pokemon could hope to take him down. Maybe if Ash has them all in a row and gradually wears Mewtwo down, but it isn't very likely.  




 Do you have a talent for causing things pain? 




 Route 209 is my absolute favorite. A lot of the special battle songs in Sinnoh (Vs Dialga/Palkia, vs champion, etc) as well. Pretty much just the entire DPPt soundtrack.  




 I'll tackle them one at a time:

O-Ren: Without the Crazy 88s to wear down the Bride, she's going to have the upper hand. That isn't to say this battle will be easy for either of them, but it'll be easier for the Bride than the original battle since she won't fall down as much. The battle ends when the Bride disarms O-Ren and takes advantage of that oppurtunity.

Vernita: We only really know of Vernita as being on par with the Bride when they both wield knives. As her weapon of choice seems to be a butcher knife, she probably won't pose much of a problem against a knife-wielding Bride. Whenever she tries to parry with her knife(ves?), there's a good chance she'll just miss the parry completely and get slashed up. 

Elle Driver: This may be the most even battle. Both are nearly equal in sword fighting ability. If anything, Elle is actually more skilled than the Bride. But she wants so badly to utterly annihilate the Bride in the field of battle. She doesn't know when to hold back as opposed to going for a kill, which will ultimately be her downfall. She'll lose her other eye (again) at which point the Bride finishes her off. 

Budd: Fuck if I know. He had to resort to using ambush and we never actually got to see him fight. If he had, there's a good chance a dude with a shotgun can take out a woman with a sword. But, with her acrobatic ability, there's a good chance she'll be able to disarm Budd, which will cause his immediate defeat. 

And finally, Snake Charmer himself. He is apparently even better than the Bride with a Hanzo sword (though he decided that their duel wouldn't be very fruitful for either party). By this point, the Bride will have been worn down by her other opponents. That being said, she'll fight even harder than ever before. The fight ends similarly to how it ends in the movie, with the one attack Bill couldn't foresee: the five-point-palm exploding heart technique. He has a monologue and walks his five steps, defeated.

 However, Godzilla wouldn't have a strong enough AT field to manipulate, considering he would be Lilim. His AT field is just strong enough to keep him as an individual and not a couple hundred gallons of LCL.  




 Gurren Lagann is only a few stories tall. Godzilla would thoroughly wreck him, no spiral power needed. Arc-Gurren Lagann is significantly larger than Godzilla, making for another pretty unfair fight.  




 GMK has a lot of weirdness, especially considering that Godzilla isn't even really Godzilla, it's a collection of souls in the form of Godzilla.

 Because while Germany wants to eradicate the hateful nature of its past governments, America values freedom of speech as well as democracy.

Germany, on the other hand, realizes that the Nazi administration was just about the evilest thing they could do and has gone out of their way to stop it from happening again.
