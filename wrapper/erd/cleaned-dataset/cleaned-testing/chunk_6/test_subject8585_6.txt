 Good for you.  Try making enough fries for 265 people within a 1 hour time frame at sea on a Destroyer that is rocking back and forth. 




 If this were presented to me back in culinary school, as in, here is some oranges, make a soup I would have done this.

Segmented one orange into perfect skinless segments.  Set aside.

Juice two oranges and strain.  Add orange juice to equal amounts plain yogurt.  To that add a flavor packet of fresh ground coriander, 1 clove, 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, 1 tsp tahini  and 1/2 tsp finely ground red pepper flakes. 

Place 3 or 5 segmented oranges in a shallow soup bowl.  Pour the orange mixture (cold or heated) over the segments but don't completely cover.

Garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and some cilantro leaves.  Sprinkle some Kosher salt over the top.


That's what I'd do.   




 Exactly what kind of eggs OP?
 




 Also no.    This may help.   http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/AlcoholCooking.htm
 




 Some sort of gourmet/healthy sub sandwiches with a side like potato salad or mac and cheese.  Prep and assembly provides work but wouldn't be time intensive and if you made you gourmet ingredients from scratch like a siracha or jalapeno mayo(jar) you could easily do this under $400.  

Or enchiladas.
    




 Those nooks!  Those crannies!  Your family and friends are the lucky recipients of your obvious talent!  Can I be your friend?
 




 I always cook like this when I'm in bed suffering from the Flu too LOL! 




 We are a Constitutional Republic but unfortunately have operated as an economic oligarchy for most of our history and more recently a corporate oligarchy.  To be sure, the average voter is dissatisfied with this arrangement.  Religion plays a peripheral role but an important one because of it's influence on society.   




 I cringed when we had to make these in culinary school!   




 Good job man/woman!  I'll have to try the mustard.  How expensive is that remote temperature gauge?  I so want one!  




 Nice, like a haute version of frito pie! 




 Your question is puzzling.  I didn't say our founders hopes for America were more precious.  I would say that all Americans that fought in subsequent wars, including myself, fought for the same thing.  The US Constitution.  Their willingness to defend it was and is based on the same hope.  




 "pregnancy isn't a death sentence"  Actually it very well can be.  Carrying a pregnancy to term is much more likely to cause maternal death then abortion. 




 Meh.....Everyone knows this. Even lowly Navy cooks, and now you do too. Congratulations, for freaking what?! 




 Hopefully, within the next 40 years, enough for a generation or two to die out, the US will fulfill our founder's hopes and become the Constitutional Republic they envisioned and fought for.  

US Government 101:

The US Constitution is not based on religion.  The US is not a Theocracy.

The US government is not based on direct democracy or the idea of "the majority rules".  Our Constitution specifically spelled out and defended the rights of the minority against the majority if it conflicted with the constitution.  This is evident by the separation of powers within the government that the people elect.

Democracy=theocracy is a non-gratis and makes no sense!  Although I know that many Republicans would love to convince the country that that isn't the case! LOL 




 Can you provide an example of one of your beliefs that is not protected by law but should be?  




 "My original comment demonstrates only the genesis of good and evil, i.e. the answer to the question of why murder is evil. Things are evil because they offend God."

Why would evil offend your god?  He supposedly created everything including evil according to the Bible.   




 Your god, as revealed to you has told you annihilate every man, woman, and child whether born or unborn from a tribe you don't have familiar ties.  What would you do?  




 You said this and I quote,    "Even while the Lord had his people, the jews, there was no actual law or written word until after the time of the Exodus".

The topic was prior religions not just the Bible or Torah.

So, I'll ask again, What are your thoughts about religions and civilizations that predate the Bible and the Koran?

 




 Please explain how a sentient metaphysical god exists and how you can prove it or disprove it?
 




 I'm proposing that there is an innate sense or morality based on empathy that does not require a God.  If you believe your god requires you to do something that runs counter to your empathetic nature then the god truths you believe in may be immoral.    




 What about a sense of empathy?  Empathy has been observed in "higher" species of animals.  Humans tend to gain this sense at a very young age before they can formulate an understanding of morality or ethics.  Empathy is an innate property of what humanity is and some other species are.  It also is the very heart of the "Golden Rule" which most religions will say they are based on even if the end results show that the original meanings where corrupted.   




 What you are suffuring from has nothing to do with your eye color.  It is called Narcissistic personality disorder.  Good luck with your recovery! 




 Are your morals dependant on a God given edict? 




 Do you think that people who have no religion lack morals?
 




 Yea right!  You're a fake and you know this.  I'm sure you love the attention though. 




 That's crazy ignorant LOL! 




 Standard 6 inch hotel pan/insert.  Not sure who makes them but you can find them at any restaurant supply store.  Don't use an aluminum one! 




 Post yourself tonight without any makeup!  Let us judge if you are real or not.  I'm betting that you can't! 




 Try a hard to semi-hard cheese such as gruyere, parmesean, swiss, cheddar, gouda or mozzarella.  You want it to melt but not so much that it disappears.   

Don't buy pregrated cheese.  It's coated with a substance that keeps the individual pieces from sticking together in the bag but inhibits the melting effect.  Buy whole block and grate the cheese you choose with a medium grate. 




 Freakishly oversized eyes and skin that has absolutely no pores whatsover,  seems legit!  Love the kitty though!  




 I think I could make mash potatoes "float" over soup without becoming soggy or dissolve if I melted a fine layer of cheese on top of the soup before I added the tators.  Sort of like putting whipped potatoes over a French Onion soup.  

Hope this helps but regardless it has given me some great new soup ideas, thanks! 




 Let me make sure I understand you correctly.  You are ascertaining that there was no written language, much less any actual written laws from any civilizations before Exodus occurred (sometime after 1500 BCE)?  




 In order to judge the morals of the Bible you must be able to have an innate sense of morality.   




 I've had mine for almost 20 years and even though I use it almost at a commercial level,  I've never had a problem with it!  The culinary school I recently attended said they stopped buying KA mixers because they kept breaking down.  Seems that the company began replacing some of the metal parts with plastic ones.  Make sure she keeps her warranty/receipt!  




 Are you referring to rational thinking people or the more everyday, garden variety of ignorant Christians that can't respond, such as yourself because there is no rational response? 




 How do you reconcile that the first 5 commandments are clearly in violation of the protections that the US Constitution and  Bill of Rights.  




 Yea, I guess I'm a little OCD that way! 




 That one bun with the stripes going the wrong way ruined it!
  




 Sounds like you felt helpless.   




 Looks like something from culinary school.  Microgreens would have been better than chopped parsley.  I bet it tasted good though.
 




 They are almost always free. 




 Why did you post this?  No really, why? 




 Yesss!  Lived in Philly for four years.  The biggest aspect of a great CS is getting the cheese melted throughout the meat.  If you get a CS with a glob of cheese melted on the top they're doing it "wrong". 




 Did you call CPS? 




 Don't assume they can't.  Some people in wheelchairs can stand or walk for short periods of time.  It's nice of you to help if they ask! 




 Go to their website.  If I remember correctly it changes weekly. 




 Ha ha!  Your argument brought to mind the ad I saw for an "enchilada" taco at Jack in the Box! 




 6 to 8 applications of BBQ sauce gave it that dark lacquered look.  




 Sounds....interesting.  Thanks! 




 Not smokey at all.  Just a wonderful scent throughout the house!  We used a Cameron smoker when I ran an officer's mess that was on the sixth floor. They are made to be used on a stove-top.  This is just my homemade version of the smoker.  




 Stuck them in the smoker for 30 min. after I took the ribs out then put them with the ribs on the open sheet pan for 1 hour basting with the BBQ sauce every 15 min. 




 Durkee "Grill Creations",  St Louis Style Smokey Mesquite seasoning. 




 You've got to make sure the foil is wrapped tightly around the pan.  I only gives off a few puffs of smoke but nothing the overhead fan can't handle.  I wouldn't use this indoors for a long smoke like 4+ hours.   




 Many people from the UK think root beer taste like some sort of cough medicine.  Me?  A champagne float with strawberry ice cream,  a juicy beef cheeseburger plus fries. 








  
 




 What is a soferita?
 




 Love it!  I invented a new sandwich when I was 4.  Bread plus an half inch of butter then stuck mini marshmallows into the butter and top with more bread.  My mother was actually brave enough to take a bite!
 









 You need to get a power of attorney concerning their physical health!  




 I was in the military and tried everything I could to get stationed closer to home in order to help my mother whom I suspected was being financially fleeced and neglected.   Why are you protecting your sister who is clearly abusing your parents?  If I can figure out who you are and therefore your parents, which is not real hard, I will report this and also your lack of concern.  This may seem normal TO YOU!  It is not!

 




 Where are your parents?  Do they choose to ignore this? 




 This is why you crack eggs in a separate bowl before using it.  The blood is not menstrual blood, chickens don't menstruate, duh!  It's just a little blood that occurred during the formation of the follicle egg sak.  

Why this is WTF is laughable!  Except some boys reactions!

 




 Chickens lay eggs.  They do not have menstrual cycles and chicks don't lay eggs.  Guess you slept though biology 1 and  basic sexual education LOL!
   




 In my opinion I think it is a combination of circumstances. 

 Many high schools do not spend much time teaching evolution if at all.  HS biology classes are usually not taught by a teacher with a degree in biology.  My own HS biology class was taught by an athletic coach.  

 Many people do actively try to sabotage the teaching of evolution.  Here in Texas the Texas Board of Education uses a citizen review board to recommend changes to textbooks.  Most of these people are not experts and some have explicit agendas such as the dumbing down of evolution or including warning stickers indicating that it's only "a theory".  Because Texas is such a big state and textbook publishing is such a big business, changes can effect the industry nationwide.

 The most devastating element to the teaching of evolution and education in general is the mindless cloning of textbook material by large corporate publishers who rely on the endless, thoughtless coping from texts going back decades and not bothering to update new scientific ideas and evidence. Laziness or sloth for profit is still a sin last time I checked!
    




 LOL!  You're delusional and not even somewhat credible.  The best you could do for humanity is to not procreate!  




 I love this! Can I use this? 




 Mike, were your parents and society you grew up in the same religion you practice? 




 Meh!   




 Maybe but it's still a coinsidence ; )
 









 Did you take your kids with you? 




 This made me smile. Thanks OP! 




 Not vagina.  Labia Major on the outside;  Vagina is not visible from the outside kiddo.  




 Their in-house made pickles are also wonderful.  My favorite is the chorizo-infuzed  Caca Oaxaca burger.  Chef Grober really rose to the occasion when he took on the challenge of creating the best burger in Fort Worth 2013 within shouting distance of Fred's, a Fort Worth all-star whole-in-the-wall burger joint since 1978!  Good things to come! 




 I used to dip my french fries into my chocolate milkshake when I was a kid.  I imagine the taste to be almost as good.  I'd probably dip each chip in real whipped cream for the full effect! 














 cute! 




 Sorry! 




 I'm guessing that your late wife didn't like a medium steak or yams?  Good on ya though.  Press on! 




 The best recipe you can use is the stovetop recipe from 'The Best Recipe' book which are collections of kitchen tested recipes from the 'Cook Illustrated' magazine. I've made this recipe many, many times for small and large groups and it always comes out perfect with a silky smooth finish. The secret is using evaporated milk which stabilizes the cheese sauce and you don't have to keep it cold till you need it. Don't forget the can opener though!

If you only have one camp stove and stock pot you'll need to make a slight modification but it shouldn't be a problem. You'll just need a small butane blow torch. The first amounts are for 6 side portions or 4 main dish and the second for 48 side or 32 main.

Mac   Cheese

Topping (opt) 1 1/2/4 cups dry bread crumbs pinch/1 tsp salt 1 1/2 /4 Tbps softened butter

Mac and Cheese

2 / 16 large eggs 1 / 8 (12oz) can evaporated milk 1/4 / 2 tsp hot red pepper sauce 2 tsp / 5Tbps,1/4 tsp salt 1/4 / 2 tsp ground black pepper 1 / 8 tsp dry mustard, dissolved in 1 / 8 tsp water to activate. 8 oz / 4 lb dry elbow or shell pasta 4 Tbps / 2 cups unsalted butter 12 oz / 6 lbs grated cheese, I use 1 part sharp cheddar, 1 part swiss, 1 part fontina and 1 part velveeta

For Mac   Cheese 1. Mix eggs, 1 cup / 8 cups evaporated milk, pepper sauce, 1/2 / 4 tsp salt, pepper and mustard mixture together in a bowl and set aside.

    Bring 2 qts or enough for 4 lbs pasta to a boil in the stock pot. Add remaining salt and pasta. Cook until almost tender but still firm to the bite. Drain, retaining some of the pasta water, and return to pan over low heat, Add butter and toss to melt.

    Pour egg mixture over buttered pasta along with three-quarters of the cheese; stir until thoroughly combined and cheese start to melt. Gradually add remaining milk and cheese, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot and creamy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the utensil you use to stir is long enough to reach the bottom and preferably has a flat end.

    Pour Mac   Cheese into serving containers.

For the topping;

    Mix the bread crumbs with the salt.

    With a gloved hand. Mix the softened butter with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over Mac   Cheese.

    Using a butane torch, carefully brown the top.

Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea! Happy Camping! 









 Cafe du Monde is over-hyped.  Spent seven years driving past the place every morning.  The few times I stopped there, their beignets were half cooked, greasy and overloaded with sugar.  Coffee was just OK.  Tourist trap. 

 Want a good breakfast?  Drive a little farther to Elizabeth's on Chartres at Gallier St.  Looks like a hole in the wall but it's the best and where the locals go!  




 Sort of like a scotch jalapeno, nice! 




 You must be in Texas! LOL 




 I originally posted the pics at r/military.  I posted this to r/neckbeards at their urging.

Most of the comments I've read were positive.  The few that were negative mostly took pock-shots at my calling my son out.  Sorry but believe it or not, every parent of a NB or almost a NB should shame their NB.  Being a NB is not something to aspire to!  

Having to ask my adult son to make sure his door to his room was closed when I had company come over didn't make me love him less and he always knew that I was trying to impart a sense of cleanliness when I made him clean his room once every 3 months.  

For all off the NB's out there, you should feel good that he won't suffer your fate LOL!  

I just know that the military will instill that into him and all the negative NB's can kiss my ass!     




 I don't believe that I'm responsible for grown men that have made bad decisions even just because we are related.   




 OIC, sort of like purple in a purple drink lol!
 




 Whataburger=Hallelujah 




 Amen! 




 Did you brine?  Looks delicious! 




 My Texan heart just grew three sizes!  Just perfect!  What kind of wood did you use?

I only just now looked at Alton Brown's recipe.  All that typing for nothing lol.
At least 'Best Recipe' gives credit to John Thorne who published it first! 




 Since dubliner is nutty and somewhat salty it pairs well with fruits like apples or pears, chicken/turkey/honey ham and most mustards.  Stay away from things that are already salty like most bacon and pickles.  A good sourdough or country bread would be good.   




 What is "brown" vs ketchup? 




 Shells are so much better than elbow macaroni.  Each shell becomes a tiny bowl filled with cheese sauce and traps little bits of yumminess!  Looks yummy OP!   




 Yes, thanks. 




 What can I say, atc_guy is right.  Hot chicks join the air force for a different reason and it has everything to do with the fact that the these prima donnas aren't cut from the same cloth that the other branches make of.  
  




 Even when I was religious I'd tell people that God helps those that (try to) help themselves.  That being said, you first need to lose your defeatist inner talk.  Everyone has set-backs in their life.  I doubt everything in yours was bad.  

You obviously know how to use a computer.  My homeless uncle and brother never bothered to learn and it's crippling them plus they are felons.  Are you a felon?  If not then be proud and thankful.  

When you put your kids to bed tonight look straight into each one of their eyes and try to imagine the strong loving person they see.  Then, before you go to bed, look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you ARE the strong, confident and loving parent that they see and you ARE even if you don't believe it!    

Keep in touch Woman! 




 Are they willing to give you a letter of recommendation?  Please ask for it  




 Your name tells all.  Try walking into a church after hours.  Locked and bolted!   




 If the condition of my son's room does not cross the border into your definition of neckbeardism, as in a room that is not a normal livable space then I sincerely feel sorry for the girl you've shacked up with.  But maybe she's a slob and it doesn't matter!  She obviously doesn't care about giving away free milk!  But hey, good on your end right! 




 Sounds like you have unresolved father-son issues and that is sad for you.  I will call a spade a spade and when my son lives like a neckbeard then I will call him a neckbeard.  We have both laughed about it and the Navy has cleaned up his act.  Too many parents won't actually parent-up and tell their 17 year old brat that they need to grow up.  I wish you luck in your nest that you share with Mommy and Daddy.    




 I sent the before and after pictures to my son and even he approved and laughed.  He is a great guy and I am so proud of him.  When YOU survive bootcamp let me know and then I will give your opinion but until then STFU! because you have presented your self as ignorant and stupid.      




 Your aunt did a good thing and I'm sorry to hear it didn't work out.  Unfortunately it seems to be case more often then not.   




 I didn't cut them off.  They can always depend on me to emotionally support them.  I refuse to support them financially and even found a half-way house that I had to drag my uncle into.    




 This is best response I've received.  Thank you!  I wish my grandmother and mom, plus the absent fathers had taught them to be self reliant but they didn't or couldn't.  What I'm grappling with is what to do if they reject rehab, a roof over their head plus meals.  I'm not going to turn my back but I won't let them rely on me either!     




 I want to thank you for pointing out ways that I may have made it it seem that my son wasn't a neckbeard.  He had trouble even growing a mustache!

I'm not putting my son down and he would be the first to confirm that, however you seem to be putting yourself down and that is sad! 









 Yes, except for New Orleans but most of them sound like they're from New York anyway. 




 roadside stands selling boiled peanuts.
