 I mean of course it is. But I heard 300mg of adrafinil is about 50mg of modafinil, I took 650mg, so about 100mg of modafinil, only effects were a light body "high" i.e. my legs and hands were a little floaty. Other than that nothing. No focus no energy. 




 Does it have a come down and is there solid research done on it? 




 It does for sure. But I took 600mg of adrafinil and 18mg of caffeine 3 hours ago, still absolutely no affect. Should I try modafinil once I'm out of adrafinil? And should I continue to take my adrafinil even with no effects?
