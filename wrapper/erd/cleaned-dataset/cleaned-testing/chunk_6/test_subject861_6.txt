 I also found [**Church History in Plain Language**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0718025539) that looks pretty good. Anyone know anything about this one? 




 So this book looks really good, not only for historical background, but explanations on the sprouting up of various Christian denominations. I might give this a go. 









 I actually thought that was really done well. He has a typical but enjoyable wrestling character. Not cringe-worthy IMO. 




 Very helpful and very encouraging. 

We as a people have such a short term memory that we can't even  




  small but fatal 




 I don't know which is more cringe-worthy, the Psychic Divas or the terrible laugh and music tracks that the producers put on that show. 




 Absolutely. I was just kidding with my comment anyways. Using any opportunity to show off my goods. Great work, mate! 




 That's cute. :)

 Just "IMHO" or "My Advice" would be good. 




 Dude. This is my first Steam Summer Sale to take part in and I have been living by your posts. I look for them even before I read the original post concerning what games are for sale.

I've played both of the games you just mentioned. Loved both. Looking at **The Testament of Sherlock Holmes**, **Child of Light**, and **The Banner Saga** from today. 




 Perfect assessment. I don't mind the graphics either. Graphics don't make or break a game to me. Out of the five main gaming elements, this is my order of importance:

1. Story/Plot
1. Character Development
1. Gameplay
1. Graphics
1. Soundtrack

My main problems with Fallout 1 and 2 lie in gameplay.  




 Thanks for the kind comments and suggestions.

Unless I just really get burnt out on 2, I will have to complete it before moving on to 3. I know they are totally different games, but I think that I will better appreciate 3 and NV once 1 and 2 have been completed. 




 Where is your TLDR of what we should buy? I've been religiously following your advice each day! 




 So, guys...this is a great response. If I could up vote you twice, I would do it thrice. Thank you for the detailed encouragement. I have taken it to heart. 




 I have. Most of the ones I have found are incomplete or really messy. There is one right over therebut it is pretty disorganized. 

 




 Good question.

1. I don't think Fallout 1 has aged well. Had I played it in 1997, I am sure I'd be a bigger fan.
1. Little direction on what to do and where to do it at.
1. Damage seems to be so random which makes the game increasingly difficult.
1. In fact, combat system is one of my biggest complaints. Don't think it is well thought-out or executed.
1. My uncontrollable party members get in my way, get shot, and refuse to let me out of a house.
1. Really glitchy, especially playing on Windows 7.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the story aspects and meta-narrative. Just playing it was what was so difficult. I'm afraid that 2 is going to be the same, just worse. 




 I'm an avid gamer. I appreciate great stories and deep characters. So, for years my friend has suggested that I play Fallout 3   New Vegas. I, however, have a personality that forces me to play games from the beginning. And when I say the beginning, I mean the beginning...of the entire series.

**Before playing recent Fallouts I must play through 1 and 2 first.**

I forced myself through Fallout 1. It was painful but manageable. I've started 2 but I don't know if I can physically do it. It is such an aged game. But I refuse to play 3 and Vegas without first completing 2. 

I need some encouragement. Direction. Hope. Tactics. *How can I play through this game and enjoy it but do so in a timely manner?*

**EDIT: I'm new to this subreddit and am looking for some genuine help. Go easy on me!** 




 I checked. It would be his 555th. Born in 1459. 

2014 - 1459 = 555.

No one seems to care... 




 Would today not be his 555th birthday? 




 I clicked thread title fully hoping to see the text box say, "...in the kitchen."  




 It's all ridiculously annoying. 

**Altair** = Syrian (light brown in color)  
**Ezio** = Florentine (olive in color)  
**Connor**, excuse me, **Ratonhnhak:ton** = Mohawk Native American (brown in color)  
**Edward** = Welsh (white in color)

**Aveline** = Half French Half African (black in color)  
**Adwal** = Trinidadian (dark black in color)

Ubisoft has been very well-rounded in character creation and utilization. Just because they went with four men and no women in this game doesn't constitute as racism or sexism. It is all a joke. People just want something to complain about. 




 Here is the best version of the gameplay at E3:

 This helps tremendously. I think I'm going to play it safe and get a medium. 




 I hear you say small and I've seen small before but I'm scared I'm going to be suffocated. 




 I know it's been asked a million times, but I need a fit analysis.

**Weigh: 160**

**Height: 5' 11"**

**Chest: 39-40**

**Waist: 30-31**

What size of slim-fit oxford will fit me? Small or medium? 
 




 We love story-driven games. Child of Light is definitely one we would like to play through. Thanks for the other options! 




 We haven't. Should we start with the original Witcher? 




 The choice-making games are fun for us. But the reason we even like making choices is because of the stellar story and plot, both of which we look for most in a game. 




 We have not tried The Wolf Among Us. Great suggestion, though. Will download and give it a try.

Limbo and Bastion are both games we have played through. Limbo was enjoyable. But Bastion was absolutely incredible. Truly a unique experience.

Thanks for the suggestions! 




 PS3 exclusive. Blah. I guess I should have mentioned, we prefer PC gaming. Though we do have an Xbox360 and a PS2 (and a N64!). 




 My wife and I like to "journey" through games together. She sits by me and we collectively make in-game choices and enjoy story-driven games on a regular basis.

Here have been some of our favorite experiences:

* Max Payne 1   2
* Red Dead Redemption
* Bioshock Seires
* L. A. Noire
* Tomb Raider
* To the Moon
* The Walking Dead
* Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons 




 It might be cool to do a weekly update. That might be too much. At least give us something regular that will let us know how you're feeling, additional and unforeseen challenges, and pics! 




 What type/kind/color of shoe would be better?  




 They are my favorite pair of jeans that I own. 

Are they cheaply made? Probably. Is the little leather label on its last thread? Absolutely. Will I have to switch these out for a new pair in a year or so? Likely. But they were twenty bucks. 

I've never been all about flaunting name brands anyways. As long as they look good and feel good, they are good for me. 




 Posted this in WAYWT. But would like some specific feedback on the most casual of outfits. I really like casual/comfortable/timeless. Am I doing it right? How can I reproduce this *feel* with different clothes?

Nothing special. JCrew, 20Jeans, Nikes. 




 I actually prefer #2. 

It is unique styling but I think it fits you a lot better than the first shirt. Navy shoes work best. 




 I'm not completely sure what you mean by RPG. Traditionally, RPG stands for role-playing games. Bioshock Infinite doesn't necessarily fit that category.

But, I'm assuming you mean games that contain well-developed characters and stories that draw you in as if you were the main character him/her self. If that is the case, here are a few of my favorite:

* Red Dead Redemption
* Max Payne 1, 2,   3
* Tomb Raider
* Mafia
* Mafia 2 
* Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic
* Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning

And if you haven't played the original Bioshock and its sequel, Bioshock 2, you should give them a chance as they are great pieces of work on their own. 




 I'm sorry, but these suggestions that YouTube is a terrible source for learning magic are completely wrong and ill-informed. Just as you can find valuable teachers concerning any subject on YouTube, you can find magicians that know there stuff.

One in particular is [52Kards](https://www.youtube.com/user/DecksAndContests).  




 My friend just married Kanye and Kim.  




 I just finished **Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven**. It is an older game, but I believe that it has aged well. 

It took me off guard at first, because at the beginning it feels like a GTA game. However, when I got pulled over for running a red light I knew I was into something completely different.

Mafia was a great game. It was a *huge* challenge. Hardest game I've ever played. But a great story and some great characters. 




 I've got a life-long ban from from Neopets. I used to "hack" other peoples' accounts and launder money into my account.  




 * My wife and I would most likely attend.
* We'd rather it outside (pool or lake).
* We could bring some food items for grilling.
