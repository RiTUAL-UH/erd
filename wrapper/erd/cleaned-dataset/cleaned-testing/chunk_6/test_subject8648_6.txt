 You're arm is being used and a gravitational message through the 5th Dimension.

 Dude. You're life is a 2000's sitcom.

 I like to read, skateboarding, and sometimes writing. I'm not social, a point that my gf or ex or whatever loved tp point out. I guess it is kinda my fault i feel depressed all the time now that i read my 'hobbies'

 




 I'm too hard on people and i expect too much and that ends up pushing them away. Its hard seeing people physically avoid you, I've tried to change but nothing. It hurts.

 I feel as if i need to get away because everyones weighing me down, my mom is currently living with me and she's just, i hate saying this, but she's a leech and her and my dad dicorced a month ago and that also hurt me pretty bad. And myself im just hate myself, my attitude has pushed many of my friends away and i feel as i am holding her down from becoming what she wants which hurts me because she sometimes cares and sometimes doesnt and that just suck. My job was my one source of income and i don't know what I'm doing anymore.  




 Thanks 




 Yeah. Sorry too, thanks. 




 Sorry. Just got laid off, Long day. Cheers m8.  




 You are a douche

 Fucking unforgiving prick. Fuck off mate. 




 Man, Robert is a hero now, kids look up to him and i hope he sees himself as one because he's overcome what alot of people can't, old habits and addictions. This interviewer just put what Rob has in his mind 24/7 to the screen. Shame on that interviewer.

"The largest exoplanet ever discovered is also one of the strangest and theoretically should not even exist, scientists say. Dubbed TrES-4, the planet is about 1.7 times the size of Jupiter and belongs to a small subclass of so-called puffy planets that have extremely low densities. The planet is located about 1,400 light years away from Earth and zips around its parent star in only three and a half days." 




 DOCTOR OCTOPUS  




 Chastity Lynn 




 Chill out there /r/conspiratard 




 Cryo. Do you even... ah fuck it.  




 I think there was a "successful" revival of a pig or something ill try and find the article.

"On 20 January 2006, doctors from the Massachusetts General Hospitalin Bostonannounced they had placedpigs in suspended animation with a similar technique. The pigs wereanaesthetized and major blood loss was induced, along with simulated - via scalpel - severe injuries (e.g. a punctured aorta as might happen in a car accident or shooting). After the pigs lost about half their blood the remaining blood was replaced with a chilled saline solution. As the body temperature reached 10C (50F) the damaged blood vessels were repaired and the blood was returned.The method was tested 200 times with a 90% success rate"

 Some people are little bitches my friend. 




 Well the it was a Battlefront TRAILER after all. 




 EVERYONE THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL SHIELD, MOVE ALONG. http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1255/647214371_4252bd7d4e.jpg 




 You guys are fucking st 




 Okay now im contemplating why they wouldn't come out, you'd have a 'survival' card. Lets say the actor unexpectedly dies, we the people have evidence of the government killing a 'whistleblower' if you will.  




 TIL that only Europeans can have crawl spaces. 




 Hopefully you'll be dead. ;) 




 Well no one wants to die right? I meant think of all the things the government can do to you, like all those torture tactics that they use. 




 Shite. 




 1. Droideka
2. You could play as a Jet Pack Trooper if I'm not mistaken and if that isnt enough you could play as Boba Fett.  




 Who doesn't like spending money?  




 Oh yes let me (The Actor) just go against my secret totalitarian style government because that seems like a good idea. 




 :,( i love you man. 




 Then don't play, dont comment, and dont even get on this sub. For not caring you seem awful worried, just observation and deduction.  




 Damn son, have fun! ;)

 Oi m8, de badger den is fo cheeky kunts aknee how, fook that m80.  




 Many dogs feel restrained when being bathed. They may tolerate it but its not something theyre eager to do. When theyre finally able to jump out of that tub its as if theyre experiencing pure freedom. No longer held back by you (their evil shampoo wielding owner) they are free, and with that feeling comes excitement.

Imagine youve just done something you were terrified of  whether thats sky diving or riding in that scary elevator at work thats always breaking down when youre done you often feel a sense of adrenaline. Its a rush of excitement if you were able to conquerthatthen you can do anything.

Many people speculate dogs experience a similar level or excitement and exhilaration once theyre freed from the tub. It might be the pent up nervous energy or it might just be a sense of freedom. Whatever it is the end result is usually the same; no holds barred zoomies.
