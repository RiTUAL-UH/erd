 When some people find their outlet for management of their disease, it can override everything else. I havent found mine yet, but when people like that do, it's pretty inspiring. 




 If you're over 18 Just insist on confidentiality. Unfortunately without a professional diagnosis there's no way to be sure. The brain is an incredibly complicated thing that even those with decades of training and experience are only beginning to grasp an understanding of. That's why medication and treatment is a truly trial and error process, we don't understand how it works. 




 It's hard to put into words, and unless you experience, comes off as whiny but I'll try. 

I can't picture anything good happening ever. I have hope it will someday, but if a good thought enters my mind, I work out 10 ways it can and will go horribly. I hate myself, my body, everything about me and have a complete overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair about my life and how i effect those around me. 




 No no. I was originally diagnosed as atypically depressed because I can sometimes find joy in day to day life. Something as absurd as that name, though still serious, has to be laughed at no matter how sad you feel. 




 I know, I completely lost my shit for a good minute. Think I concerned the doc.  




 Elegant though that reply was it missed the mark of what happens with mental disorders completely. There is no test for chemical imbalance. A psychiatrist makes observation and recommendation and you find the right prescription and dosage through, for lack of a better term, trial and error. Think about the topic being discussed a little harder before you flaunt your ignorance 




 Think of it like trying to move a huge dresser up a narrow flight of stairs with just two people. Watching a happy video is like doing the whole thing by sliding it on the carpet. It gets a little further, but doesnt help that much and is eventually going to slide back down.  




 Moved out of my parents house five years ago but sure.  




 Yeah, Ive gone through periods of weight loss where that's been better, just hasn't gone all the way and I fall back on old habits. 




 In my darker periods it can be. Sometimes cripplingly so, to the point where I can't make it from my bed to the couch. Those are the days that I have to really struggle to get through 




 That always does seem to oddly help. I've always put others first and making them happy makes me happy in return. No such thing as a truly selfless act. 




 It's no bore but I appreciate the support, and am going to start working towards it. 




 I understand, and thanks for the support. As I've been saying, I don't want sympathy, it wasn't for cake day, I simply saw a depression topic on the front page, and thought it would make an interesting discussion. Thanks. 




 Lol. Much appreciated. Thanks! 




 Not meaningless at all. And it's not false hope, that's what's keeping me going. Thanks for the good wishes! 




 It does but I'm dealing with it as best I can.  




 Yeah. I was on Lexapro for a while, and it worked good for me for a few months before I plateaud. Made another friend drive into oncoming traffic. There's just no real way to know.  




 We've started me out on prozac but I think Avanza is one of the alternatives we discussed if that doesn't pan out.  




 That was the point of the ultimately futile part of that and why I did my second point.  




 psycho to your panda? 




 It's essentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder.

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor but it can get overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia.

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill.
 




 quite the opposite. How are you dealing with it? 




 Anytime.  




 Very cool, I'm glad you found someone who's crazy offsets your crazy.  




 It's cliche but it really is like walking down a never ending pitch black tunnel with water up to your shins. It's cold, uncomfortable, and suffocating. It gets to the point where (unless you also have an anxiety disorder) you don't worry about anything because nothing matters, nothings ever going to pull you out of this. No one's been in your tunnel before, sure they've had their own tunnels but yours is different and no one has a map to it, so you just wander. 

It's not that I'm ok with it, I've just lived so long with it it's a part of me and I had to develop the sense of humor to not open a couple veins in a bathtub lest things get so damn dark. 

Thanks for the question! Let me know if I can help anymore.  




 I appreciate that but it's not always that simple. The way our brains work sometimes it's not something that we can work around with a well timed fuck it. Sometimes it's something baser and chemical.  




 Or my insanity drop to the point where I no longer perceive it and so therefore become paranoid that it's so overwhelmed me I can't know which drives me insane again.  
It's a vicious circle,
Just goes round and round.  




 I want to feel better, not nothing.  




 I will look it up. Thanks! 




 Joking aside, making someone else laugh is the biggest high I've ever gotten.  




 To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of the women.  




 All the time. But labeling it as an illness if you feel that way is destructive. People are very helpful and a 2 or a 1 isn't a healthy way to live. You have to live your life how best you see fit and whatever makes you happy is cool by me, but I would look at seeing how you can work at cranking that scale up a bit.  




 Thanks! I'm taking it day by day to work towards that. And I'd love some recipes, thank you. I enjoy cooking when I'm clear headed it's just motivating myself to get up and do it that's the issue.  




 I think that's fairly normal behavior for everyone, though there are others who could probably answer that better. But as I've said throughout this AMA, if you ever feel hopeless or unsure about that stuff, see a professional. One session can work wonders, even if it's just stress getting you down.  




 Oh I laughed my ass off. It's absurd. Don't be sorry.  




 Haven't ever heard of that. Will look it up. Thanks.  




 Right now no, but we'll see where I end up.  




 Yes it does, but it's also nice to have a reminder, Thanks! 




 I have not but am starting to do research into it.  




 Thank you! 




 Came close a couple times actually. How does it feel knowing you're going to miss everything cool and die angry? Never mind, you're way to clueless to be that self aware.  




 I'm sorry to hear that. I was a sick kid a lot and I can't imagine getting to that point.  




 Very True
