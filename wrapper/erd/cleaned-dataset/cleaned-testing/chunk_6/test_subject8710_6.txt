all i can think of at the moment i like the idea  




 would love to see warring kingdom jarvan. 




 the carry, the Carries carry 
i actually like that i hope that isnt taken for you 2 but basically the carries carry is the support in how they carry 




 well if you can give me an idea of your mains and roles i might be able to help. however off the top of my head.

1. the sun/the moon, besides being cheesy it works in league for diana and leona.
2. the hunter/the hunted. rengar in general
i guess i can understand how much harder it would be since you want to make it cute and its not easy becasue most names might be taken but perhaps you can find inspiration through some of the champions in league or a book
