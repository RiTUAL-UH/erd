 So I've just finished watching Ao Haru Ride and loved it a lot, although I wish the romance had been more pronounced in it. I'm just really in the mood to watch a solid romance anime that isn't too old and has a really nice story like AHR or Sukiitte Iinayo.

I wouldn't mind something with a bit more comedy either, like Lovely Complex (one of my absolute favourites!). I guess the most important criteria here is romance, and not just wishy-washy romance, but actual solid romance...something to make my heart race! :) 




 OMG I've just finished watching all the available episodes of Ore Monogatari and I love it! 




 I've just finished watching Shinsekai Yori for the second time and I can't help but feel blown away by it. At once, I feel very subdued by the dark themes of the entire anime, but at the same time heartened by the ending and Saki's will to change her society for the better. 

It's such a chilling anime, and I don't think I really understood why until now. Ethics are such a vital part of human society, and the way they are warped in SSY really made me question not only ethics as they stand today, but also as a system of thought. Essentially, I guess it made me really start to think about why certain things are bad and some good. At what point should we assign 'rights' to something? Are only human beings really guaranteed rights?

I guess that's the reason I love this anime so much. I'm so fond of deep thinking and turning difficult questions over in my mind. Each shocking twist of the plot jolts you out of your thinking and seems to make it all the more real. 'What if such and such really did happen?' 'What if that was how society really is?' It's a philosophical and emotional rollercoaster and I simultaneously loved and hated that. 

I'm curious as to what other people felt when they finished SSY. Did you start questioning the nature of the world like I did? Or, was it a purely emotional story about children growing up in a post-apocalyptic world? 

Also, I'd love to discuss some of the broader themes of SSY...like the bombshell about the queerats at the end, or the nature of children's rights and such...so, GO! 




 That's fair - I really like anime like Shigatsu, so it was pretty addictive for me :3 
Maybe try one or two episodes. It was a little bit confusing at times so I could understand that :D
