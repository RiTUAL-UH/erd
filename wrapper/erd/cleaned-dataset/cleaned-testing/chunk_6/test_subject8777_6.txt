 You own the mineral rights to those 20 acres and can build non permanent structures on it with a non concrete foundation and so long as you can tear it down with no evidence that it was ever there, you can build whatever u want...for the most part...  




 Will do my friend! Thanks for the love!

 Already ran into him.. 









 You are correct..we are hoping it is signs of a pocket near by..exposing bedrock with lots of virgin gravels on top..looks good so far :) 




 Maybe $25... 









 no music up anywhere yet tho :( 




 so if you look at the maker of the toy set, it is the same name as who apparently left the ransom note for the family...oh man, gotta love photoshop! 




 as a drummer who has played many shows in the past, DO NOT PLAY YOUR HARDEST SONG first.... that is horrible advice! Play the song that you and your band feel will keep people's attention and make them wanting more, that way you can get the audience into your music and band and if you fuck up down the line, chances are no one will notice. As opposed to playing your hardest song first (which to the average listener, they wont be able to tell) and possibly fucking it up and having that be the thing people remember because it was your first song. 

In the end, put together a set that will keep people interested, and that doesnt necessarily mean playing your hardest song first.

Bring lots of sticks and keep a rag near by for those sweaty palms because with it being your first gig, no matter how calm and collected you are, you gunna get the nervous sweats

Make friends with the front of house engineer too, he ultimately holds the fate of your band for that club in his hands....saying hello and offering to help with any kind of stage set up really does go a long way.

bring lots of sticks and dont drink too much before the stage, being drunk at your own gig is over played

AND REMEMBER, have as much fucking fun as possible and keep telling yourself this is why we all got into gigging in the first place! 

Good luck brotha! Whats the name of your band?

 As an audio engineer, this blows your mind...? As a producer or electronic Dj, ya for sure..bt as an audio engineer myself, this is lame
