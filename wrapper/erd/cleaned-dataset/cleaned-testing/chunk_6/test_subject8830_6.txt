 No worries! The more people that play this game the better. It's one of those you can keep coming back to and replaying.  




 Enslaved odyssey to the west is an amazing single player game. It's quite overlooked but it's one of those games that just draws you in. It's based on a really old Chinese story Journey to the west and its adaptation is brilliant. It has really colourful scenery. It plays like a 3D platformer with some puzzles and stuff. Really recommend it.
