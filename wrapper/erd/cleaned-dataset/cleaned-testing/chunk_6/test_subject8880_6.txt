 Superboy Prime was created to somehow include a Superboy in the Crisis.
He was just a version of Superboy. Not the original.

 It's coincidence. And don't call me Shirley.

I have a soft spot for shmups and fighting games. But one game always stands out : Super Mario 3. 




 Your comment belongs in a museum. 




 Whats the oldest tech you still use? 




 Is that...a butthole behind your head? 




 Fat status overloading.... 




 Me too. I got some VHS Movies I bought at the local video store before it closed down. I grabbed some rare, out-of-print, never released on dvd/blu-ray horror tapes.
They still have the genre stickers on the spine, the hologram stickers on the tape itself and video store stickers too. I have some Blockbuster and Movie Gallery tapes with the store stickers on them too.

 Let's review this shit.

How does a city reuse a former basketball arena when the team moves to new digs across town? 
 It was a rough place - the seediest dive on the wharf. Populated with every reject and cutthroat from Bombay to Calcutta. It's worse than Detroit.

And what if, hypothetically, that arena is shaped like a pyramid?
This? Why, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl..

 If youre Memphis, you fill it with a 535,000 square-foot Bass Pro Shop, then sit back and wait for the apocalypse to arrive.
Bad news. The fog's getting thicker.
Built in 1991, Memphiss Great American Pyramid has been empty for over a decade, looming on the skyline like a bad idea conceived after too much cocaine. Numerous proposals have tried to revive the 32-story pyramid but none had the $191 million backing of Americas most audacious retailer.
And Leon is getting laaaaarrrrrger.

In addition to the sales floor, the store is like a Vegas-scale Bubba Gump outpost including a cypress swamp with live alligators, a bowling alley, a restaurant, an observation deck, taxidermy museum, and a hotel. If these photos arent enough to convince you of humanitys impending doom, there are more images over at Bloomberg Businessweek. The store opened today.
 There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?

 




 Three in the pink, three in the stink.

 I found a pair of womens thongs in the ice cream section once.

 You monster. 




 When someone you know lies about something. Then they cover that lie up with a lie...then the truth comes out.
Satisfying. 




 Badgers? 




 Black Sabbath is the Beatles of Metal. Hell, their Never Say Die LP was the one critics hated but still is a hard good album.

 Tn State Troopers are affiliated with the Department Of Homeland Security now. They have some powerful tech in those cars.
I should know. I live in a small town in West Tennessee where the Troopers pull over more cars than the city police in the city limits.

Tennessee has a very horrible drug culture. Meth, Molly and Ice is what they are looking for. And Ice is fucking crazy.
