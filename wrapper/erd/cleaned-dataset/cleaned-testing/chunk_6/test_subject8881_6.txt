 Darlene doesn't look at Mr. Robot. She rolls her eyes in that direction while still looking at Elliot. And remember that when Mr. Robot cuts off one of the guys, if the theory is true, then it's actually Elliot cutting off the guy. The lady you are talking about is just looking towards the right. She is not looking at Mr. Robot. 

But putting all that aside, after the comments made by u/Bear__Jew, it might be true that the writers are just trying to fuck with out brains. Mr. Robot might after all be real.  









 Dude. DUDE. I think we should stop before we kill the surprises they have planed for us.   




 So this is him? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUN5C8hKLzA

 Is your friend working for the show?  




 Totally. I had a huge smile on my face when this scene came on.   




 Exactly. Look at [this guy's eyes](http://i.imgur.com/OdT4ydb.jpg) for example, he is looking at Darlene. I think it's just Mr. Robot who's not real, for now. Also did you notice how Elliot din't react when Mr. Robot put his hand on his shoulder? 
I think it's now obvious that Mr. Robot is not real.  




 Look at Darlene's eyes when she is talking. She is looking at Elliot, and not Mr. Robot.
Here's another one, when she is asking, "What's the plan?" : http://i.imgur.com/UlcnkHI.png
You can watch the scene again to make sure. It's kinda obvious now.  




 Are you Elliot's father? From Mr. Robot?
