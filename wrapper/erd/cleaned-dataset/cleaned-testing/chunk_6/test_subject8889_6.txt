 the silent treatment is much worse than grounding, buddy

(especially when there isn't much to ground when you're kept on a tight leash) 




 People laughing in your face man.  The one time I ever got suspended, I was in 10th grade (year 11 for any Brits reading), I was scared and devastated, kind of internally losing my shit.  The particular assistant principle who was asking me questions and filling out the paperwork was a real jerk to me.  I'm not saying I deserved to be treated specially or anything like that, but I believe I deserved a basic level of human respect, you know? 
In my fear and anxiety I asked a kind of silly question, which he could have just answered matter-of-factly or maybe, maybe chuckled at, but instead he more than guffawed; he outright laughed out loud to my face when he answered me.  
This of course only served to make my fear and anxiety (about what awaited me at home) much worse.

I was in trouble though, so that's one thing.

Last semester, I am in Grad school btw, during a meeting about our theses (dissertation in other nations), just to go over general guidelines, I asked a serious question about the scope of the topic area (trans-atlantic comparative policy as opposed to a purely European focus), and the professor leading the meeting did the same obnoxious laugh in my face and rather than saying "yes, people have done that; it fits the program name well." he said " *guffawing laughter* well it has to have some European element to it; otherwise, why are you in [this] program?"

Thanks; thanks a lot.  Made me want to leave the room at the time, but it was a mandatory meeting.
He made it clear that he didn't think I belonged there when it came to my assignments too, but it's ok.  I'm not the one with a problem, so I don't let these things get to me. 




 I graduated in 2011, and I consider it quite a while ago because so much has changed in the world and everyone's lives.  We, and the world, were all so different it seems. 




 that and the unauthorized breaks just show she was spoiled too much as a child and cannot fathom not getting whatever she wants /  having her way.  




 could also be a creeper using that line as an excuse to blatently photograph pretty people 




 that is disturbing.  *shudders* 




 love the quote; I googled it and couldn't find an author though.  Probably because it's worded slightly differently.  Great nonetheless 




 That's an interesting angle, comparing it to physical motion, and it makes perfect sense.  Although functionally, telling your arm to move and using your mind to move it as it is done normally, do not really seem different, your arm doesn't move if you just think it, you have to physically get in there and make it move.  

So based on your analogy there, and my experience, perhaps the "mental theater" really is necessary....

Seeing as the thought that is used to move the arm is not in the form of words.  I guess it is in the form of energy. 




 OK, I got an opportunity to test this hypothesis this morning.  It could be a mental block, so others must try it to give the results more validity.


So , my nose started bleeding at 8:17.  (I am prone to that as you may have inferred.). Just as I was about to leave.  I covered it with tissue but used no pressure.  It was going quite heavy.  I tried twice to just concentrate on willing it/ mentally asking it to stop, with words.  It was still going strong.  At 8:18 I tried it the usual way, visualising the energy and the physical healing.  It stopped immediately.

For reference, prior to realizing I could do this for myself, my nosebleeds would typically last upwards of 5 minutes with the help of a cold compress, longer and slower without.  So yeah, its a major blessing. Point is though that, even though it theoretically should work without the visualization, this proves that, at least for me, it is definitely quicker andeasier with. 




 I think that's more of a mind trick, but what a neat way to be opened to the possibilities 




 I love that episode. 




 neo-imperialism FTW! 




 not so weird at all; I noticed this about myself, and I googled it and its common.  I thus included it in a fictional story I wrote on /r/nosleep : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p11q/part_1_invisibility/ 




 It's nice to be taught by a parent in the home.  My dad is heavily into all martial arts and the mystical concepts which stem from that interest.  He studied meditation, and has books on all sorts of related things.  However, he never really got into any of these things with me, only vaguely maybe.  He is fascinated with levitation through meditation.  Other than that.... 




 I would have upvoted you, but your points seem to go well with the Darwin Award concept IMO 




 Worst Case Scenario: that person is disturbed because your "Fartglare" looked sexual. 




 telekinesis; that is very ambitious.  When you've been practicing with that for long enough, does the time and effort it takes for it to work decrease, as I have always suspected? 




 in my experience; telepathy is a very personal connection.  Opening those lines with people you don't know well is quite dangerous.  If you are not mentally strong, they can easily plant ideas and affect what you think you think.  Watch out for that if you're even remotely serious. 




 "healing service"; learning "from a master"  ; that sounds impressive.  Ancient, formal arts; I think it's fascinating how different cultures and traditions use such different means to accomplish the same goals (and also have a variety of different goals in some cases...) 




 smart teachers make you swap papers twice.  two graders. 




 It depends on how exactly this was all measured.  There is narcissism, and people who come across as self-righteous jerks. 

Then, there are people who have confidence, who can be kind of know-it-alls, and other such traits, but that is not the center of one's character.  It is possible to be confident and believe you are right about things but also know you are not the center of the universe and be a kind individual.

I completely understand the attraction to confidence for a number of reasons.

The particular statement about manipulation is concerning, but I don't think such a questionnaire can truly evaluate these intricate, elusive components of a personality.  




 yes; although blind people can do things without seeing it, it is undeniably easier when you can see what you are doing. 




 wow; well kudos for picking it back up!  I never fully dropped it, but I have been somewhat inactive the past 5 years as well.  (Which was mainly to protect someone and because of a relationship I was putting all my energy into.  But that's irrelevant.)

I too have the dreams, quite frequently when I get enough sleep.

Getting adequate sleep will help you have more of the dreams. 

You can remember dreams better if you make a note of it right away.  Keep a notepad and pen on your nightstand.

and thanks for the welcome :) 




 well, as mentioned above, I always remembered "Stein" too.  At least you have something more stable/concrete to tie it to.  That confirms that we didn't just collectively mis-pronounce then.

now I can feel uncomfortable again.... 




 ah, ok, so that's a little different from what I understood you to mean. 

So the issue is not whether or not the energy is behind the effect, but whether that energy is simply the intent and we are just attempting to process it by visualizing it.

In general, the energy is not physical, it is electrical.

The visualizing I guess is a method which allows us to channel and control the energy.

The intention and the energy are two separate things though.  

You need the energy; things don't happen with intention alone, not really. For example, I intended to go to the store today, but I didn't put in the energy to get up and go do it.

The "sensory theater" of visualizing things is a method of using your mind to channel it, although you're right, it's not truly necessary for the effect.  The energy itself is though.  (In my humble understanding). 




 well clearly your upbringing has had a lasting effect, seeing as you eat bunnys 




 i've come to the same taking chances conclusion.

I was only single for three days in high school; I started HS in an LTR and finished it an in LTR which just ended last year.  I am now in grad school with a deplorably limited amount of expierience in this confusing "game" if you will.  

Depending on how you look at it, you could say the taking chances has worked out ok so far, but I've learned that you should still be careful when taking chances, so as not to ruin anything along the way.  So, I'm still holding the taking chances philosophy, but I'm being cautious.  Perhaps too cautious, but I honestly don't know what to do in any situation I am faced with in this regard, as I have practically 0 experience in being single. 




 I'm in grad school.  I hate to redo anything.  I hate to even retype something if the backspace accidentally makes the browser goes back.

I would be super super pissed.

I would try to figure out how to come back, and if I couldn't, I'd focus on not making the same mistakes and go about things in better more respectful ways. 




 and mine was 100% covered by my existing insurance!
Thanks Obama :)   (in a 100% non-sarcastic way) 




 you're welcome!  I hope this gives you some ideas for experiments to use that excess energy 




 Great!  feeling your energy is a good first step.

You need to be able to clear you mind to control it well.  The best exercise starting out is to meditate and think of nothing.  It doesn't have to be for long, just start small and go longer as you get better at it. I mean absolutely nothing.  Not your breathing, not your heartrate, not the fact that you're thinking of nothing.  **nothing**

Separately from that, if you're not already doing so, visualize your energy.  Visualize it moving through your body and to your hands.  Focus on your breathing as you do so.  Visualize it flowing as you breathe out, but don't release it.  Visualize it flowing into a ball between your hands.  

As far as actually using it is concerned, you have to have an intention with a need or desire behind it which drives you; you focus on harnessing your energy as described above, and you use your intentions to direct it to a purpose. 

That is my attempt at a vague description of the process.  If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask 




 yes, people do; I personally don't have the patience for it.  I'm sure it gets faster and more effective with practice, but starting out it takes an insanely long period of intense concentration and I'm just not up to the task.  

A friend of mine did it in class when he was little and freaked people out.  

now, something marginally easier which I have accomplished is using energy to manipulate electronic devices.  It has a visible physical result, but the energy doesnt have to be converted into physical kinetic energy; it remains as an electrical impulse just as it started in your mind, which is my understanding of why this is easier to do.  

My most successful experience occurred, in 8th grade, out of necessity, which is key actually; unless you are really practiced in these things, for it to work, you have to **need** it.  There is great power and energy in desperation.  With which I incapacitated 7 overhead projectors in various ways (as I did not specify a method in my intention).  The great necessity felt by my 13 year old mind?  I had trouble reading from those antiquated projectors and I did not want to be made to get glasses.  My desire to not have to get glasses was a really intense need to me.  

The point of adding that last detail is that, **need** is relative.  It's the energy created from the need that fuels this.  

Being full of energy as you are, you probably don't *need* the **need**. 




 this is quite rare for me.  I usually just know things are going to happen, or that someone will call or whatever, maybe see them in my mind. 

I do regularly, at least a couple of times a month, smell something randomly that isn't there.  Like, I randomly smelled chocolate chip cookies burning in an oven one night last week.  These smells usually last a minute or two.  Sometimes less.  But they are quite distinct, and are not the result of a strong craving, as I have no desire for burnt cookies.  

Now that you've made me think about it, the first explanation that occurred to me just now is that maybe someone I have a connection to was smelling these things and the sensory perception transferred to or was picked up by me.

In any case, seeing as you have experienced Clairalience, pay more attention to what you smell.  Then test yourself by focusing on something you couldnt possibly know or have smelled yet (like, what your mother or neighbor, or grandmother in another state, is going to cook for dinner tonight).  Don't try too hard or you'll disappoint yourself with a mental block.  Just relax and focus on imagining them (in this case cooking).  Then, if you do smell something, check later (by calling, going next door, whichever is applicable) to see if what you smelled did in deed turn out to be the case.  Don't be discouraged if it wasn't.  

Trying to harness abilities such as these is an issue of trial and error usually fraught by high expectations and fear of failure.  When you're first trying to do it on purpose, you may smell something at first because you really want to and not because you actually picked up on it.  So don't be disappointed, just keep trying.

Again, the key is not to try too hard.  Just relax and tap into it.

Although I don't have experience with *psychic smells* , I have simply taken the model I have for honing any such ability and applied it to your situation. 

I hope this helps!   




 your wording is a bit convoluted, but I understood the question to mean, are we really influencing things with our energy, or is it more of a self-fulfilling prophecy in which we use our will to lead us to/ give ourselves "permission" do things which make it happen.

Did I understand you correctly?

If so, then, yes and no.  It depends on what you're talking about.  

The giving permission idea can be similar to what happens when one prays for strength or courage to do something.  You give yourself confidence to follow through.

But, that is not how everything works; that is only in those cases which involve personal action on your part.


If you are directing your energy to, say, short-circuit or otherwise overcharge or break a light bulb, that is a matter of physical electricity/energy.  It is a more concrete physical process and outcome which occurs, so it is certainly a result of the targeted energy itself and not the notion of giving it permission to break. 

Living things which can process the intent-guided energy in more than just a physical way is where you question becomes pertinent. 

If you are directing your energy to heal something, for instance, your friend's nosebleed.  When the bleeding stops, it is not because you gave it permission to do so, but because you contributed energy to accelerate the process.  Your energy served as a catalyst.

If its your own nosebleed, then you could argue both ways.  The brain controls the body.  So, yes, you fed energy in to catalyze the process, but, you also, with your mind, ordered your nose to stop bleeding.  You can control your breath, and your heart rate (via adrenaline and nor epinephrine) with your mind; when we tap into a few extra percent of our capabilities to do these things, one could certainly argue we are just using our mind's natural ability, through whatever neurological processes, to control the body.   




 not so clearly for me; my intuition works more like, say I'm planning to go out for a walk soon.  Suddenly I'll feel all throughout me the impulse to "go, go right now" because it'll be beneficial to me.  So I do, and then I run into people with seemingly perfect timing.  It's more vague than what you describe. 




 I'm so glad I came across this thread.  I have been excitedly running into people with whom to discuss these things on /r/paranormal and /r/Glitch_In_The_Matrix , and I had been thinking there should be a sub dedicated to this.  

Anyhow, I wanted to hear from others how you got started working with energy.

Did you read something?  Did someone expose you to it?  Did you have an experience which inspired you to learn?  or Did you simply start without any particular stimulus that you're aware of?  

How old were you when you began?  or Have you been doing it as long as you can remember?

I thought this might be an interesting discussion to have; to compare "origin story"  notes :)

My answers, for example: I have been doing it as long as I can remember, to a lesser extent.  I really awakened my potential at age 12, after having read a book which empowered me to take control of my life and helped me to overcome the social adversities I faced, as well as to explore my full potential (from the theoretical food for thought proposed therein, not the specific content itself). 




 eh, well idk either; that was just my attempt to dismiss it and not dwell on it.  As long as nothing else happens, it's nothing to worry about regardless of what it actually is.
