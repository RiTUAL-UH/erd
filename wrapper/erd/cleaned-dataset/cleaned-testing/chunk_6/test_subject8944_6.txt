 It should be a thing. I don't think I, or anyone else I know, realized just how much work it would be. I had multiple law students describe it, but actually doing it was a complete wake up call to the amount of work that had to be put in. 




 Maybe, but if I were TJ, I'd still want the fight to get that loss back. 




 Two scenarios: 

(1) If the candidate died the day before the election, would (s)he be taken off the ballot? If so, who would (s)he be replaced with? The VP on their ticket? If not, and (s)he still won, would the VP become president?

(2) If a candidate won and became president-elect, but died before being sworn in, what would happen? VP-elect becomes president? Something else? 




 I'm lost. 




 Replying to wrong person. 




 Likely not enough evidence to charge the guy if your video doesn't show his hands on your neck. I'd steer clear of his home if I were you. Should you have to? No, but it's the smart thing to do if there is an alternative route. 




 I'm so sorry.

Was your cat an outside cat or would the cat have been stolen from inside the apartment?

You could always have a lawyer write up a letter demanding the neighbor return your cat and hope it scares them into giving the cat back. 




 Money? 




 Perhaps the agent is upset because he didn't properly verify your identity. You should ask him about that. 




 Went to a 9:30 yesterday. There were only two other people in the theater besides my girlfriend and I. 




 Just want to point out that lots of people say "I have nothing, you will never be able to collect," it's not necessarily true. I would highly recommend getting the judgment in small claims court. The filing fee isn't much and it won't take a ton of time.

Then you can fulfill the judgment anytime in the future. If she ever gets a job, you can garnish her wages. If one of her grandparents/parents ever die and leave her any inheritance, you may be able to get a cut. If she ever wins the lottery, you will get your cut. It seems highly unlikely that for the rest of this woman's life, she will never have any income or assets.

Also, I'm reasonably sure that interest will be included whenever you are able to collect. 




 I'm not a lawyer, but maybe one can chime in on the legality of just not paying the landlord and leaving it up to them to bring you to court for non-payment at which point you bring proof that nobody was in the apartment for three weeks and then the burden of proof would be on the landlord. I'm inclined to believe that if the landlord admitted it was his/her workers plugging in that caused the overage, any court would make them pay for it. 




 Well assuming he got his money back fairly quickly (I know, a big if), then he could have reinvested and caught the market on at least a portion of the upswing. 




 Why false? The market did fall over 40%. 




 I tend to agree with that. Anyone can go nuts for a minute 30 and outshine their opponent. 




 You could suggest an alternative of getting a camera to cover the area if it's usually all in one place. Also, you could point out that this would have to be an ongoing thing, where every time a new dog moved into the neighborhood, they'd have to get DNA tested. 




 Warning to OP: he will likely claim OP gave him permission to do so, and if that's the standard business practice (I'm unfamiliar with the gold trade business), then it seems the decision may be tilted in the gold buyer's direction.

Then again, just the threat of a lawsuit is enough to scare some people to pay up. And, the filing fee for small claims court is usually not much, so it seems worth a try. 




 I apologize in advance because this will come off as racist, but if you just go to the airports and stand in front of the United and American terminals, because no security to stop you from getting there, and look for the most Islamic-looking people you can find and call them out in front of everyone. At the very least, on that day at that place your odds are pretty decent of targeting the right people, and innocents who get offended are just part of the deal, unfortunately.

Maybe they'll bail at that point. You can point out that they have boxcutters and give light details of their plan (they have pilot training, etc.). At the very least, it seems the authorities will detain you and them and you just try your hardest to convince them.

I at least remember United 93, so that's one terminal I can definitely get in front of and execute the plan. 




 What a time to be alive.

Drone dude was probably just hunting for boobies at Spring Break. 




 If he comes back looking anything like the fighter that destroyed Mizugaki, I still think he takes the belt. 




 I'm not a lawyer, but it seems pretty straightforward that by not signing to un-enroll your child, he is effectively not allowing you to choose the daycare. Therefore, HE is the one who is not complying with the court order. Perhaps talk to your attorney to see if the attorney could send him a letter to this effect. 




 Ok bud. 




 Ok bud.

I find it hilarious that your entire comment karma is negative, btw. 




 Ok buddy. 




 Can a lawyer chime in on the legalities of the husband appearing and paying the ticket for her? 




 Here, the orders were warranted because the dog (correctly) alerted on the car. So the officer had every right to ask the man to step out and search the car.

Haha coming away with no charges does NOT mean he was illegally detained. 




 Dude needed to learn to comply with cops orders. Dude got arrested because he didn't. 




 I thought the same thing. I can only guess that it was because of the length of the fight.

Look at Ronda's last few fights. Were they beatdowns? Yea, she whipped the hell out of her opponents. However, it would have seemed more of a beatdown if she just battered the opponents for 25 minutes. 




 If it is illegal, you can and you should. For example, if he hits you or threatens to hurt you in any way.

A police record showing hundreds of violations will only increase your likelihood of you being able to get out of there as fast as possible. 




 Which country can you buy 12 UFC's for $120? 




 I mean they can, but it's against the rules and could result in a DQ. 




 Just in case anyone else just got curious, season 2 is set to premiere in "mid-2015" whatever that means. 




 Yea.... It's definitely time to lawyer up. 




 Why don't we do those? Sounds fun. 




 You call the police every single time anything out of line happens. If you have to call 100 times, so be it. You don't have to walk to the police station every time. Walk to the nearest neighbors house and ask to use a phone to call the police if you don't have a phone. If that neighbor doesn't answer or refuses, continue on to the next one.

By continuing to call the police, you will have a continued record of what is happening. 




 Eh. I guess. I feel like if a fighter's corner thought he was being brain damaged enough to throw in the towel, the fighter should least care about the manner in which he lost, as long as it was clear he was going to lose either way. 




 http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations

Section 15(A)(xxx)

It's illegal.

Edit: LOL downvote me for showing you the light 




 It's legal in boxing. Not in MMA. I know, it's stupid. 




 So wait, if you were not working there before law school, what was their incentive to pay you to go? How did you apply for this deal? 




 It's so funny how people view experiences differently. I worked for several years in a professional office and got used to the 40 hour work week then nights and weekends are mine. Then I attended undergrad and went straight to law school after. I found it MUCH easier to go straight from undergrad to law school, because I was used to giving up my nights and weekends to study. While I agree they are nothing alike, I still found it easier being used to working nearly every night and weekend, as opposed to only the occasional night and weekend in a real world job. 




 Good point, fair enough. I guess the fighter would just lose by DQ, but if you're gonna lose anyway who cares? 




 Corners can't stop the fight in the middle of the round. It's in the unified rules. 




 Like the other guy said, what if OP dies in a car crash on the way home from the funeral. Now there's 7 kids with no income. At least if OP has life insurance, they'll have some sort of fallback. 




 At least you could explain that away by "he just got caught," and you're not the guy who assured his friends that Barao would wipe the floor with TJ, and then TJ outclassed him the whole fight (even though we all thought Barao would win). 




 Yea, watching that video and Rogan says something like if Nurmagomedov is dominating RDA like this, then I'm excited to see how a fight with Pettis, the top of the food chain goes. It's crazy that Khabib DID dominate the the top of the food chain like that. It just so happens that RDA was above Pettis' level. 




 For real, before FW got moved to the UFC, the best in the world were in the WEC, except for a few small exceptions. 




 I honestly thought Jon Jones would beat Matt Hamill. 




 Not the time or place, dude. 




 It is almost surely already criminal. If I were you, I would (in order) cut my contributions to zero, start job searching, and report the CEO to the police. 




 I'd be very interested if you have the time! And it seems like there is a lot of interest from others around here. 




 I'm sorry if this is too much but do you think you could just post the top 10 for all weight classes?

Like you should make the rankings a whole post and explain a bit how you came up with them. I for one think it would be very interesting and probably pretty popular. 




 Why are you being down voted? Isn't what you wrote true? 




 I use VPI and I've made two claims for a total of about $3,000 in the past 3 months. They're great, you just email in your claim form and receipts to them and they process it and send you a check. The only downside is you have to pay the entire cost upfront. 




 I have it because I know I would spend anything on my pet to keep her from dying. I also know I don't have the funds right now to deal with that.

The deal with insurance is that, on average, it's a bad deal. That's how the companies profit. If you have the money to cover a potential large expense (think $5K per animal) then you're good. If you don't, then get insurance.

I pay about $200/year for my cat and I've used it twice in the past 3 months to claim a total of $3,000 from the insurance company. It's worked out for me. 




 Damnit I was off by 100 days on my math. Oh well.

RemindMe! 7300 days "You did the math wrong" 




 RemindMe! 7200 days "Check the bet" 




 Pettis did the same thing in his post fight speech. "After the first punch, I couldn't see out of my right eye. No excuses." 




 You could just tell me. It's not cost of living because he's not comparing NY to anywhere else. It's not PPP because he's not comparing another country to NY. And if you think it's CPI, you should check the source on my inflation calculator. 




 Not necessarily. The Court could interpret the ruling however it wants. It could legalize marijuana for just those plaintiffs or for all of CA. 




 Sorry that's wayyyyyy off. NY State minimum wage in 1979 was $2.90 (http://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/minimum_wage.asp). Adjusted for inflation that would be $9.34 (http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=2.90 year1=1979 year2=2015). Extrapolated out for 40 hours per week for 52 weeks a year, we arrive to $19,427, nowhere near the $50,000 you claim. 




 Does that not make those grad plus loans ineligible for PAYE? 




 Very surprised not to see MMA on the list at all. 




 No but really. Explain where I've been childish. 




 Lol. Justify how ever you want. I was asking because I was wondering what jobs besides actors take off months at a time. I guarantee you come off as more of a creeper than me to any girl with that comment. 




 Way to be a creeper dude... 




 If you don't party and focus you can easily get a 4.0 in your year at UTSA. With that you are virtually guaranteed to get into UT. 




 What do you do if you don't mind sharing? 




 Obamacare still caps the annual out of pocket cost at $13,200 even if he's on a family plan. This is sketchy.

https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-limit/ 




 If you're Packer fans join us at Red's Saloon when NFL season begins! 




 I just want to throw Pet Insurance in here as a possibility too. I've paid about $200/year for my cat and she's racked up bills of over $5000 already from eating a spider, a couple UTIs, and getting into some lillies (highly poisonous for cats).

I'm aware that, on average, insurance companies make money. That's why they sell their product for the price they do. Therefore, you need to do a cost-benefit analysis. I knew that I would get my cat to the vet no matter what because she's a family member to us. And I knew that, being in graduate school, I couldn't afford it if she had a big expense. Therefore I will keep insurance until I have a job where I can afford a several thousand dollar expense if need be. 




 This. OP should contact the trooper at his phone number and notify the trooper that he just became aware that it is against the law not to report the accident since he believes the damage will be over $1000. Unless the trooper is stupid, he won't argue at that point and OP can easily get the trooper's insurance info. 




 I have several friends who work at the DA and that charge is never dropped around here. I guess people in different JX's have different experiences. 




 Well I don't know what the charges are, but $200K bail generally means it's pretty serious, and this is not his first offense. I think it's decently likely he could get several years.

Edit: Read the article. Charges are resisting arrest, battery on a peace officer and unlawful fighting. The prosecutor will likely be out for blood for battery on a peace officer. That alone could get him several years. 




 Even still. I doubt Mayhem has $20K to give up. 




 Bail generally works where you pay a bondsman 10% of your total bail amount and they post the whole amount to the jail. However, the catch is you don't get that 10% back when you turn yourself back in to the court system for trial, like you would if you had paid the whole amount yourself. 10% USUALLY isn't that much. However, here it's $20K, so I'm inclined to agree with your original statement of "bye bye Mayhem."

Sidenote: When people skip bail (don't appear at their next court appearance), and have made bail through a bondsman, then the bondsman in some cases is entitled to bring the criminal in to receive their money back. This is where you get shows such as Dog the Bounty Hunter. He's a bail bondsman. 




 I don't know about pointless. I think that it works *most* of the time, just not every time, as long as you keep it to only 2-3 degrees removed from the first fight. It's not very accurate when you get to the point that Might Mouse beats Fedor like 26 fights removed, but it is pretty good if you have A beat B, B beat C, therefore A will probably beat C.

Let's look at this current scenario. Khabib beat RDA. RDA beat Cerrone. Khabib will very likely beat Cerrone. Not 100%, but it's pretty likely. 




 If you got 8th in your class you are likely a hard worker.

I went to a pretty hard high school and was barely out of the top 50%. I then went to UTSA for a year and focused on my studies and no partying. It was ridiculously easy. I was top of ever single one of my classes and easily had a 4.0

I say this not to brag, but to show you it is possible. If you're a hard worker and willing to put in the time, you can likely successfully CAP in. Now it's just a matter of deciding if you're willing to live in another city for a year.

Also Austin is a kick ass city with tons to do. I grew up there and it's just become better every year with ACL, SXSW, the kite festival, tons of hiking, Barton Springs, Zilker Park, 6th Street, etc. whereas I have a good friend at UNT and he hates it cause there's nothing to do. 




 As a Packers fan watching the Bears get rid of Marshall, the Lions get rid of Suh, and reports that the Vikings are trading AP... I'm just excited.

Edit: And with us keeping Cobb!! 




 Yes. 




 I applied every year and was never approved and I had a zero EFC every time. They just run out so fast. Everyone knows about it, unlike the article implies. 




 I actually threw you an upvote because while I don't agree all his competition has been crap, I think it has been a significant step down from what Johny and Lawler have been facing lately. 




 What card is 2% cash back? 




 Cause we've seen Johny and Lawler slow down significantly in 3 round fight whereas Rory is still going strong at the end of 3 rounds in pretty much all of his fights. 




 Dude he definitely gassed HARD in the first fight. I mean Johny did too, but not as bad. Johny won the 5th of the first fight and that was what put him over the edge. 




 Oh I completely forgot they just had another one. I just moved from the Austin area actually and missed that one. I was talking about the one like 5 years ago headlined by Palhares/Marquardt that ended in disappointing controversy. 




 I bought tickets... I wake up and pray to the injury gods every morning.

This is my second UFC event and the first was Fight Night Austin with such a disappointing ending. 




 Agee. But I think Rory will just have a deeper gas tank. Remember how Robbie looked dead for the majority of the last 2 rounds in the Hendricks fights? That may have been fine in those fights, but Rory don't gas like Johny. 




 How would anybody know not to park in the spots then? I haven't read the statute but I'm almost positive it would be illegal to tow in that scenario. 




 You need a breakdown of ALL expenses. You only listed housing. You're missing food, medical, gas, car insurance, pet costs, cell phone, entertainment, household costs, gifting, and anything else you spend money on. 




 Look at refinancing it. I've heard of Sofi but do your own research.

Also, you didn't post your budget but if you are paying $1000 for housing costs, you can probably fit all other monthly expenses into another $1000 per month. Where the heck is all your money going???

You should budget it all as low as possible then use all money to pay off your debt. I'm almost positive you could be done in 3 years. 




 You may actually want to look at getting a credit card. For example, the one I have gives cash back of 1% on everything and 5% in certain categories every month. All together, it works out to about 2% per month cash back. Adding up roughly what you spend (can't use it for mortgage, electric bill, or child support), that would be about $600 per year.

I just set mine to full auto-pay each month out of my account and never worry about it.

Also, I'm not sure if you have an emergency fund, but it would give you some form of payment if you had a true emergency. Say your car broke down and needed a $300 repair tomorrow. Can you pay it? What would you do in that situation. Yes, it sucks to be in CC debt, but it sucks even more if you can't pay to fix your car so you lose your job and then you lose your house because you don't have a job, etc. 




 I hope you got the drivers insurance information and several of the witnesses names and contact numbers. 




 Many times, it's the guys who are loose and having fun out there that can get inside their opponents' minds. Werdum-Fedor comes to mind where Werdum was laughing, joking, and making funny faces all fight week. 




 Everyone forgets Father Gabriel. 




 Non-military here. Why so? 




 Non-legal advice, but perhaps there are social services he qualifies for since he was abandoned. Maybe start with calling the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (http://www.dhs.state.pa.us/) and asking them where to go from here. 




 I'm saying if he walks in with a lawyer and wants a plea deal, they will likely offer him a deal where he pleads guilty to a lesser charge. In that scenario, the prosecutor will drop the original charge.

I see where my original post could be misinterpreted from my intended meaning. We both obviously know how this would work so lets stop arguing about it. 




 How am I an idiot? I said "if you plead guilty, they'll drop the case." What room for sarcasm is there even? By "drop the case" I mean to say they charge you with Murder 1 then plead to Murder 2, they will drop the Murder 1 charge in that case. They have to. Again, I don't even see anywhere where I could have been sarcastic. I'm not recommending anything, merely stating facts. 




 Well it's your weed budget for the rest of your life then. 




 I'm not being sarcastic. 




 So Chik-Fil-A makes tons of extra money, people get reheated, day old food, and you don't make any profit because you gave it all away? 




 I'm guessing from your phrasing that these are both already reality. 




 Of course they'll drop the case if you plead guilty because that's their whole goal. If they charge you with murder they'll drop that too if you plead guilty. 




 Dude just get a lawyer. Look at it like this: you had enough money to buy weed. Take the money you were spending on weed and spend it on a lawyer. Lots of them will do payment plans. As others have said, look for a plea deal that doesn't affect financial aid and is eligible for expungement.
