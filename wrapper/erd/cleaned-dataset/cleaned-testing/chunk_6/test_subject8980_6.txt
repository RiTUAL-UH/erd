 Cheers, pal :) 




 Haha, I won't lie. Your comment about the second one being too creepy made me smirk xD
And I have a much more whimsical song, much like the one you said you'd prefer to hear, that was somewhat inspired by Shaco but it's only about 30 seconds long. I can upload it to YouTube for you if you'd like to hear it? 




 Thanks :)
