 Well, as someone with a kid, I cannot blame them. I wonder - how would you handle it if your kid was walking from a convenient store and ended up shot dead, and then the shooter is not only not put in prison but CONTINUES TO OWN GUNS!? Jesus fuck. Rocks and bottles do not a gun make.  




 How bizarre; the guy seems to attract trouble. So many arrests / violent run-ins. Dangerous human being.  




 Hernandez was only confirmed as the shooter through Bay County Court documents. According to court records, Hernandez was in another room of the apartment practicing form in front of the mirror and the gun  accidentally went off and went through the mirror and the wall and fatally injured the daughter, his attorney reported.

...

Hernandez and the girls mother, Cynthia Votta, had been in and out of child custody court since 2011, according to court records. Hernandez was awarded sole custody in 2013 after Votta moved out of the home without the children, court documents indicated. In September, a circuit court judge ratified Hernandezs award of custody. 














 My heart goes out to the family. The horror of the two younger children watching their father and older sister massacred by someone will affect them for life, I'm a mother as well and cannot fathom, yet the fact that I do imagine it makes me work harder to ensure we put an end to this kind of terrorism we are all threatened with daily in the US. No other developed nation has this kind of crazy gun violence taking out citizens on the daily and yet not a peep from those in charge of keeping the safety. I didn't hear any politicians comment on this at all; not one mention. 

As the mother's brother said, "no one needs a gun." He implored people to stop praying for an end to gun violence and take action 



















 Thanks for the work you're doing! As a mom raising a child in America, this is my biggest concern, gun violence. No other issue takes so many American lives daily and yet is not being combatted as it should be. Imagine if ebola were killing 83 of us per day.  









 He's not by anyone outside the wingnut fringe of god|gun worshipers.  




 I Hate Huckabee 




 The city's police chief, Tim Styka identified the dead Monday as 33-year-old Jonathan Stoffel, of Neenah, his 11-year-old daughter, Olivia Stoffel, and 31-year-old Adam Bentdahl of Appleton. Stoffel's wife, Erin, was shot three times, but survived and is hospitalized in critical condition.

Another family ruined by this fucking plague of guns and small-brained egotistical fucks. This guy was en route to becoming a police officer and in his anger, shot and killed a child.  









 I did not know who she was until reading about this event. TIL she thinks Obama's dad is secretly Malcom X. Well, secret except to her.  









 Curious how different those months were for the fetus vs a baby in a normal active mother. Having carried my own son to term, I often had internal conversational thoughts toward him while he was in my belly, touched my belly, etc. This makes me wonder if nurses spoke into the belly, or rubbed it etc. One would hope so.  




 There's a strange self-flagellation in America where people almost gag-reflex statements about why things can't be nicer / better / more effective here like other places. Fuck that shit. If you can't see a better future, go work on your imagination. Don't poison the environment with blanket denial based on pessimism. I'm all for input based in fact, but if you just come to say vague negatives for why berries specific suggestions aren't for us, g'wan now.  


































 He's by far the best Independent running as a Democrat, anyway. I love the guy!  




 Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.  




 Any republican with sense would actually agree with this; Bernie is for the American people, the worker, the little guy, the boostrapper, doing the best for the strongest growth our country can muster. Seriously, all that shit the GOP talks but goes 180 against? This guy is the real deal.  




 No protections in place for American workers. [Here's a link talking about his stance on the TPP for example.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file)  




 I wonder if the DNC will do him the same way the congressional dems have run away from every progressive move Obama has made?  




 When you wear shit stained glasses, Walker looks like a rose.  




 Agreed! We lost some good ones when Feingold and Kucinich were out.  




 Agree totally, if we move in a better direction in this country, the fringe right wing will fall off, Hillary's center-right coalition will be our conservative wing, and we will have an energized progressive left that moves toward a much healthier future. I have to be optimistic after suriviving Reagan, Bush I, Shrub and the return of Shrub...it's been a sad dismal drag to the right concluding with the obstructionist klan situation that's been fucking America over at every turn.  




 A woman had a bullet in her neck, the third of 7 shattered window incidents. Have you got a source that this is not bullets? Do share if so. Otherwise all accounts point to an ammosexual.  

















































 No shit. Hope they figure this out soon and before someone dies. The girl is still in the hospital who was shot last week. Fucking bullshit.  









 Stupid decision does not equal the theft of another's life. No one should take a life. People take drugs because our brains have receptors that often give positive feedback to the taker. If that is unacceptable in society, find a fucking civilized solution. A cage = a murder is not that solution.  




 Barbaric nation. Fuck the death penalty. Humans, evolve.  









 I hope this post is read by all. 
 




 Exactly. It's fucking despicable. I sit here with my young son and wonder WTF is going on with the USA, how fucked is it going to get? 

Every human - do not shoot/beat/sever spines of people. 

Every human - do not seek violent revenge. 

*please* 




 News reports have said that James Holmes bought his arsenal legally. But did he really? The mentally ill arent supposed to own guns, and is there anyone who thinks this guy wasnt wrong in the head? He supposedly was odd enough to creep out a Colorado gun range owner.

A report last year from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that states arent doing enough to stop the mentally ill from getting firearms. After the Gabrielle Giffords shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that the bar for banning someone from owning a gun is awfully high.

Ill say the same thing I thought after Seung Hui Cho went on his murderous rampage at Virginia Tech: How about requiring a co-signer for your gun license? This could be a family member, a friend, a co-worker, anyone who could swear he knew no reason you shouldnt have a gun.

 









 Also using appleTV as well as trying it out on my ipad / desktop - no hiccups at all. Don't have gigabit fiber, so for me this is wonderful. When I was using a friend's login and watching it as HBOgo, it did have hiccups.  




 Signed up. Fucking happy. I was one who bitched loudly about the lack of options for cord cutters specifically related to HBO, so I am one of the first to sign up for this. Curious how many people signed up in the first month so far... 




 Unfortunately we still do not question insanity before we sell ammo to people in the US. 

[...Holmes had purchased over 6,000 rounds of ammunition online in the weeks leading up to the tragic shooting.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/23/james-holmes-received-amm_n_3327140.html) 



















 Funny, American here and I frequently use sheie.  




 Human mountain goats. Or, Mountain Humans.  




 Wow, that's an incredible photo  




 As a single mom who is busy...basically always...I have had moments when I'm standing in the kitchen and the dishwasher is washing the dishes, the washing machine and dryer are also going, and i have a realization of how incredibly fucked I'd be without these machines. Meanwhile I can cook and code and pay my bills.  




 Fuck. This kind of moment is so important in understanding why everyday Germans were not able to stop the fascists. I studied the holocaust in college and remember thinking if every person in the German population had refused to go along, they Might have been able to stop it. But it would have taken a massive collective to do so.  




 Don't think it's a she? 



















 At this point I am glad for how the halfwit terrorists react to kindhearted people trying to stop death. Because they will be the nail in their own coffin as we overturn 2A to end this scourge.  




 In the same way that ISIS wins by killing people; they terrorize and bring fear and spark death and violence.  














 "Shortly before 2 p.m. Graham Anthony Pittman ignored the pleas of park rangers and shot himself in the head while sitting inside his Jeep Cherokee, according to Tony Underwood, special agent in charge with the State Bureau of Investigation." 

The report states that the younger Pittman, who was 28 and the father of two young children, shot himself in Morrow Mountain State Park in Stanly County, in full view of visitors, following a domestic dispute.


Rep. Pittman has championed expanding gun owner rights in the General Assembly and during his campaigns for the District 82 House seat. 


Pittman is the primary sponsor of a bill filed Tuesdaythe day after his sons suicidethat would prohibit any local government employees from enforcing federal firearms laws, unless by court order. The bill, titled the Gun Rights and Privacy Act, would also repeal local prohibitions against carrying concealed weapons, and would streamline the handgun permit while traveling across state lines and to make the purchase of a firearm more efficient.  









 Still worth getting it on record, and cc: the white house with your message. Fuck these so-called representatives who do nothing close to representing the people.  




 Right. It's just a message to the plutocrats and the Klan.  




 Fuck the GOP. Fuck them to hell.  









 No one has EVER assumed I was female online unless I have a female name or image next to my name. And yet here we are.  




 This is the clash of very-recent history and today in the US; there are now two generations born after the civil rights fights where people were killed for trying to gain voting rights, where government officials presided over brutal treatment of blacks - obviously not to say it's "fixed", but it isn't what it was. So the term is a clusterfuck because the history of race in America is. 
But even with these reminiscences, those times have the feel of distant history, of dusty newsreels and faded photographs. So the programs central focus is on what it calls the last lynching in the United States: the murder of Michael A. Donald, 19, by two young Ku Klux Klansmen in Mobile, Ala., in 1981. Or as Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, the third delegate Mr. Koppel spends time with, says, in the era of color TV.


James Knowles, one of the murderers, says on the program that he and his confederate, Henry Hays, the son of the local Klan chief, had randomly selected Mr. Donald as he was walking down a street one night. The two kidnapped him at gunpoint, then drove to a wooded area where they beat him and slit his throat. They returned to hang the body from a tree within view of the Hays family home.


The case became a landmark, though; after the men were convicted, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center brought a federal civil suit on behalf of Beulah Mae Donald, the victims mother, connecting the murder to the Klan as an organization. In 1987 the jury returned a $7 million wrongful-death judgment, bankrupting the local chapter.

 There are always commenters on these stories saying "welp, shouldn't run from the cops"

These are the same people who would sign off on concentration camps during Nazi times. Gotta be a yes man, fascist and free.

 I try not to watch ISIS beheadings, or cop shooting videos - that kind of barbarism really fucks up your soul. I will however work to stop it by reading and being aware of it - not advocating ignoring, but watching such brutality is poison.  




 This same misogyny and harassment can also be seen with the Gunsense hashtag -- a hashtag used by gun safety advocates and Shannon Watts from Moms Demand -- a grassroots organization working for gun sense in our country. This hashtag is trolled regularly by pro-gun, NRA types which results in shameless comments. Shannon's tweets and Moms Demand tweets are also trolled non-stop.

As a matter of fact, if you say anything pro-gun safety you will be trolled -- hashtag or not -- by a legion of trolls. I have personally been the victim of that many times. But by far, nobody gets it worse than Shannon Watts of Moms Demand, and her organization. Check out her timeline on Twitter any time and you will see what I mean.

 














 The first time that I was posted to Washington, DC some years ago, the capital and suburbs endured a frightening few days at the hands of a pair of snipers, who took to killing people at random from a shooting position they had established in the boot of a car. I remember meeting a couple of White House correspondents from American papers, and hearing one say: but the strange thing is that Maryland (where most of the killings were taking place) has really strict gun laws. And I remember thinking: from the British perspective, those arent strict gun laws. Strict laws involve having no guns.


After a couple of horrible mass shootings in Britain, handguns and automatic weapons have been effectively banned. It is possible to own shotguns, and rifles if you can demonstrate to the police that you have a good reason to own one, such as target shooting at a gun club, or deer stalking, say. The firearms-ownership rules are onerous, involving hours of paperwork. You must provide a referee who has to answer nosy questions about the applicant's mental state, home life (including family or domestic tensions) and their attitude towards guns. In addition to criminal-record checks, the police talk to applicants family doctors and ask about any histories of alcohol or drug abuse or personality disorders.


Vitally, it is also very hard to get hold of ammunition. Just before leaving Britain in the summer, I had lunch with a member of parliament whose constituency is plagued with gang violence and drug gangs. She told me of a shooting, and how it had not led to a death, because the gang had had to make its own bullets, which did not work well, and how this was very common, according to her local police commander. Even hardened criminals willing to pay for a handgun in Britain are often getting only an illegally modified starters pistol turned into a single-shot weapon.


And, to be crude, having few guns does mean that few people get shot. In 2008-2009, there were 39 fatal injuries from crimes involving firearms in England and Wales, with a population about one sixth the size of Americas. In America, there were 12,000 gun-related homicides in 2008. 














 Officials didn't release any names and said it was unclear whose gun the boy used.


Well then their work is cut out for them. Track. That. Shit.
