 1. Working for Cracked was less pleasant for me pretty much across the board. Meaner editors, often terrible feedback (admittedly because they had more pitches to read so they felt they had to skim a lot) and political agendas for lists I didn't agree with. 
2. I could write what I wanted for Cracked, but it was pretty much all spec until they posted that it was approved.  




 1. Once. It was a guy covered in fake plant stuff like he was cosplaying Swamp-Thing and holding a flower. I said "Guilty over his part in the Kennedy Assassination, the Grassy Knoll became a hippy." 
2. It didn't win.  




 1. I'm fine with it as long as they give links and credit to artists, and try to include actual research and commentary on it. 
2. That said, my favorite site like that (other than Listverse of course) is clickhole.com.  




 Seeing it. I assume what happened was during a period when my brain was developing my sex drive while I was really young, I saw it happening in some cartoon and that somehow got mixed in with my impulses. 

But as far as I know, that might be debunked Freudianism.  




 1. I never would think Cracked going "SJW" is one of its problems. I'd say it's real problems is when it reports inaccurately for the sake of clicks. Jason "David Wong" Pargin has numerous articles full of complete bullshit if you actually research them (particularly his private obsession with insisting being overweight is untreatable except through surgery, which his own sources don't condone anymore, or his "Monkeysphere" article.) If a writer reports honestly and gives the facts accurately, it doesn't matter to me what their agenda is. 
2. I assume that was a dig at J. F. Sargent. Well, he was always nice to me but I remember a lot of factual holes being poked in his article about video game prejudices. I haven't read much by him since that I can remember, so I don't know if he does more thorough fact-checking now. 
3. I think Cracked is way better than it used to be.  Much as people get all nostalgic for 2007, that was when Cracked reported straight up horseshit sometimes because they didn't have to cite sources or when Pargin would say a suicide note without a suicide was "gay."  




 fwiw, it doesn't really bother me either but I only tell people about it online. 

Best thing about FA is it means you've got nothing to lose socially! 




 There was no *like* about it! 




 1. Probably because I saw it in cartoons a lot during my sexual development. 
2. Eh, why not?  




 1. If Cracked's editors accept one of your articles, they make you fill out a form with your tax information and such before issuing you a payment through paypal, which is a one time thing. 
2. Jamie Frater at Listverse just makes you fill out a form granting him rights to the list and then sends you payment through paypal.  




 You're welcome.  




 Yes. I said it was weird.  




 Sigh. 

I'm thinking Twi's new castle will feel a lot colder and less homey by comparison.  




 Hey Mr. Baruchel, was making This is the End fun or mostly a pain?  




 Yeah I could. I just have to draw it or pay someone to. 

I know, jk.  




 Eh, it's just a matter of conditioning too. You can use associative training to induce phobias or whatever. Same thing, except generally accidental.  




 Can he swing
From a web?  




 Seeing cartoon characters inflate like balloons. 

Incidentally, I was going to be interviewed by former Cracked writer Ian Fortey about that for a book he's working on, but that seems to have fallen through.  




 What about that doesn't make sense? It's about your brain forming a connection between a certain thing and stimulus.  




 I think Kurt Vonnegut said he tried to do the same thing with Slaughterhouse Five.  




 1. I got banned from Cracked from mentioning in a comment section that the editorials sometimes are disdainful of contributors and suggesting that they recruit new writers because they pay them less than the veteran writers.

2. Yes, they often alter written articles. I've had my points about people completely flipped because editorial thought it would fit the tone they wanted better. I would have preferred they just send it back to me with a "do over" note as that would have encouraged me to do more proofreading at a younger age.  




 1. Never read an issue of Cracked, I just read the site. 
2. I do remember reading Mad magazine in sixth grade, that was pretty sweet.  




 1. I find my own ideas at Listverse and Cracked. Cracked occasionally kind of assigned articles, but that was primarily for columnists. 
2. Hmm... Probably the one above about obsession art is my strangest list.  




 1. Listverse doesn't force a comedic tone that their high turn out means will become samey and kinda grating after awhile. 
2. As a writer, Listverse is much more open in terms of ideas they publish. I'd never have gotten the film inventor article published at Cracked unless I'd become a columnist. 
3. Listverse doesn't force in certain prejudices against acceptable targets. The fetish art article above would have had a much more judgmental tone if Cracked had accepted it instead. 
4. As a reader, Listverse puts all its content on one page. 
5. As far as I know, Adam Tod Brown isn't an editor at Listverse.  




 1. I got banned from Cracked from mentioning in a comment section that the editorials sometimes are disdainful of contributors and suggesting that they recruit new writers because they pay them less than the veteran writers. 
2. Listverse pays less per article, but for me it's been such a better experience that if I'd known what I was getting into I would have quit Cracked long ago in favor of them.  




 I have one that I think most people would find incomprehensible instead of creepy. It's the type that gets mocked on Somethingawful and Encyclopedia Dramatica every once in awhile. As ridiculous as it might seem, it cuts down on the need for a human sexual companion a bit, which as someone who has the lack of confidence that some psychologists believe leads to a fetish anyway, is out of the question for me anyway. 

You too?  




 http://listverse.com/2015/01/20/10-provocative-works-of-art-based-on-one-persons-obsession/

I like how the title tries to dance around it not being fetish art but the article is really blatant about it. 

Pretty sure it's actually all SFW, but why risk it? 




 She'll still just zone out during foreplay.  




 Literal pointing and laughing when I fell in a river during a hike during a school camping trip. 

Holy shit does remembering this ever make me feel less alone.  




 I've gone on a study tour of Vietnam, done rock climbing in Texas, swam in the Pacific Ocean and tried to surf (seawater is some nasty shit.) I've tried going on bar crawls and gone to fancy restaurants and hotels. 
Never while doing any of these was I happier than when I watched a movie I enjoyed.   




 This is actually kind of old and someone did tell this very rude person how to leave the group. I didn't include that in the screencap because it wasn't funny.  




 Of course not.  




 I'd just prematurely ejaculate and then wait for her to leave.  




 I've gone on adventures. They've all sucked. Expensive, uncomfortable, often very annoying because they involved sitting around waiting for something or led to something disappointing. 

I don't envy the adventurous.  




 I just saw Selma and it got me wondering if there were situations in, say, Russia where after the serfs were freed police or soldiers had to be dispatched because certain local governments would not free slaves or grant the freed slaves their basic rights? 

I don't know if the fact that in U.S. history it is generally understood that it took a civil war to end slavery while most other nations ended it without a war makes that country anomalous.  




 Yes. If I had the money, I would have myself chemically castrated.  














 Women drinking when they're looking for casual sex. I am not saying women who have bad experiences as a result of their impaired states deserve anything at all that happens to them but I don't understand why you'd do that in such a risky situation. It just seems to increase the risk of being assaulted, contracting an STD and/or getting impregnated, or having sex with someone you wouldn't want to if you were sober. It's like going out snowmobiling but intentionally worsening the steering or smearing your visor in advance.  




 Why would anyone take life seriously? Horrible people are on top for completely unjust reasons. People get away with crimes all the time. And it's all effectively pointless since eventually we're all going to die and be forgotten no matter what. You'd have to be stoned off some endorphin or another to take something like that seriously.  




 God is Hyperbole and a Half ever the most overrated thing on the internet. Obvious points made slowly interrupted by unoriginal comics crappily drawn.  




 Bring Pinkie Pie into the cave of wonders? What could go wrong? 




 Wait, why was the human pretending to be asleep to annoy Pinkie?  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5nlAkArpOQ

Speculative fiction (sort of) about why humanity has never made contact with sapient life from other worlds.  




 I wonder what the bottom 100 were.  









 Mason has come unstuck in time.  




 Now I feel bad that I made Matt feel bad because it made me uncomfortable when he made a joke. It's a vicious cycle of bullshit.  




 It's an order.  




 I can rant on it if you really want.  









 Have you ever seen some extra try adlibbing a funny line to get a raise?  














 How does this not already have 8000 upvotes? 

Oh, they must have forgotten to tweet or share a link to this thread.  




 Bet that guy's going to post a SO RANDOM vine to /r/videos with the same story.  




 Yes. As tempting as courting the progressives and the LGBT community might be, Disney is well aware that conservative countries and the heartland are their bread and butter so they'll make sure to squash those homophobic complaints.  




 That short is so great, then we get a good look at this goofy-looking monster.  









 "I'm unemployed, but I've got it way better than these people."  



















 Prejudiced against people without faces? You facist.  




 I don't believe labels to be an effective sorter.  









 Wow, is he ever bitter-looking.  




 /r/badass 




 Never go to Norway, /r/creepy. You'd all have heart attacks by the end of the first day, apparently.  














 http://youtu.be/2Qy4EIvvVj4?t=14s 




 It's more boring than sappy. 

"We hit an animal and didn't injure it much."  














 Bill Murray doesn't show up until half way in it and isn't particularly good, from what I've heard: 

http://www.filmthreat.com/features/79089/ 




 Russo-Finnish *Platoon*.  




 I've heard you were a real jerk during the recording and that they had to chase you around with the microphone. Aren't you ashamed of your behavior?  




 FO:E is still a huge downer. But then, so is pretty much all post-apocalyptic stuff.  




 Oh, so suddenly hanging out in a kid's bedroom makes you a "creep!"  




 http://listverse.com/2015/01/11/10-fascinating-facts-about-steven-spielberg/

A few of these I was genuinely surprised I'd never heard of before, like the whole marijuana thing and the toilet movie. By the way, has anyone ever heard of Arnold Spielberg outside of in relation to his son?  




 The deer eyes are so distinctive that they made it so that I had to take a few moments to study the reverse and see that it's supposed to look like a seal when it's flipped.  




 Certainly not. I don't mean to be snobbish, but even as a kid, I felt "huh, this Harry guy is just like another chosen one" since I'd already seen The Matrix and Star Wars and that was a bit of a hurtle to ever getting too immersed in it.  




 I'm trying to be offended, but honestly, I think they look too well done for that.  




 It feels like it doesn't really honor the man properly if it's not somehow equipped with devices that kill anyone that touches it.  




 Creepy nothing! That looks awesome!  




 For what it's worth, I was quoting an alternate take from that scene.  




 I've seen numerous ads for them and became curious what you guys would have to say about them.  




 Can something be disturbing but not creepy?  



















 I ain't that good.  




 SPOILER: It turns out in Amazing Amy that Amy frames the boy she has a crush on for murdering her. Makes it even more embarrassing for Nick that he didn't see that coming. 

 




 http://listverse.com/2015/01/09/10-frightening-facts-about-horror-movies/

I think the thing about losing 184 calories by watching The Shining is a bit dubious but overall it's pretty neat.  









 I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good. 

For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.  




 There really are better ways to store all the teeth you collect.  




 Thank you for your apology.  




 Personal Landmark anecdote: I was going to attend one of their recruiting events, but I overslept and missed it. 

It was a time in my life where I was too much of a fuckup to get swindled.  




 Finally! The gritty Toy Story reboot! 














 What's so badass about that? I thought that was one of the early signs Walt was actually the villain of the show. It's just random, petty destructiveness.  




 I admit I'm a latecomer to the fanbase, but from what I understand, it was a low-rated show for the first few seasons until Gus became a major player. That's around the time that Walt and Jessie stop being compelling bumblers and start becoming quotable criminals that fans start finding "cool" and such. Is this impression correct?  









 MPAA rating calls "shenanigans."  




 Youtube ads. I like the thought that my checking out their video made my favorite channel a tiny amount of money, so I'll just open another tab and do something else until the ad's over.  









 Isn't this more like a fish ranch than a fish farm? 

That was just an excuse for saying thank you for doing something that we'll need more of as a species soon. It must have been very difficult to develop.  









 And the officer says "Here, let me bail you out of it." And then he takes the guy to jail for the night.  




 How did you not know that's what Legend of the Overfiend is? 














 It was about the prom date that took the brooch and hung out with other guys.  









 It honestly kind of made me uncomfortable when Donnelly called that woman a cunt.  














 Not from what I heard. For example, when they were talking about how the past wasn't as sophisticated as we remember, they just mention the things from the articles (Police magazine existed, Sugar Sugar was a #1 hit, etc.) with no further analysis besides saying "Now, you think THIS, but..."  




 The climax and ending of this movie just don't work, I don't care how meta the ridiculous of the movie is supposed to be. It's rushed, too silly to be invested in anymore, and unsatisfying.  




 I never thought this image really worked since the way it's cropped it looks like it could so easily be faked.  




 I assume that's New Zealand dollars, cause I heard those trees only cost $500 American.  




 I'll buy that for a dollar.  









 A lot of it just seems to be stuff recycled from the articles.  









 I remember there being a lot of snot in this movie which really grossed me out as a kid.  




 Between this one and the Fluttershy booping herself one, I like to think there's a running theme developing of the ponies being embarrassed by their human equivalents.  




 I know and have listened to multiple people who love bad movies in person and through podcasts. They will talk about generally traditionally masculine subjects like sports and the like, but when they talk about bad old movies, they won't shut up about hairstyles. Like if they mention Road House or some bad cult movie from the 1980s, mullets and such will come up. I have heard so much about the rat tail Anakin Skywalker has from people that hate the prequels, 1970s hairstyles for movies from that decade, and so on. I have never heard people talk about this in regards to good movies.

What's the deal?  




 No, that's why I asked.  




 Is this spec?  









 If he had hit that cub and the mom went after him, he'd probably still be able to pedal away from her pretty easily, right? 




 But that crowd is going to stereotype everyone anyway, and hey, at least if the documentary existed it would indicate we're willing to admit those members of it exist.  




 Winter is infinitely more uncomfortable than it is beautiful. Much as I love this movie, it is in the top three Disney movies I would least want to be in. 

The other two are Mulan because of the mountain scene and The Little Mermaid because I would drown quickly.  




 I heard the guys on Retsupurae complaining that Unexpected is too biased towards positivity and The Dissolve had the same complaint about BT, so would you be interested at all if someone made one about the clopping, gore fics, bullying, and so on? I imagine getting the cooperation of the subjects might be a little harder or involve more deception.  




 At this rate, eventually they'll go a live action The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and it'll all be worth it.  




 Roth and company are too embarrassed to admit this, but the only copy of the movie got locked in a time capsule.  




 The Rumpus Room was lost forever when the house went into the sinkhole in the movie.  




 Crap. This actually bothered me. I might need a pony hiatus.

Starting tomorrow.  




 Pretty much everyone else in the world saw Inception, right?  




 Isn't every pony "______butt" then? Why did the fans nickname her specifically Sunbutt?   




 That's the most generic comment I've ever seen on any genre. I've seen this said about anime, comic books, comic book movies, tv shows, folk music, etc. There will always be people who dislike the way things currently are because they don't realize there was lots of forgotten junk in the past and think the past was better because only the classics remain. 

Name any era of horror and there's lots of obscure terrible content that can be pointed to as evidence that at that time people weren't exploring its potential.  









 Isn't he modelled after one of the writers?  




 I wonder how much licensing a show costs.  




 But Yoda said that the dark side isn't stronger. If the show was part of the dark side, the light side would just get its ass kicked.  









 http://knowledgenuts.com/2015/01/02/when-meat-was-more-deadly-than-combat/

This probably wasn't anywhere near the first or only time this happened, but it seemed to be the time with the most social impact.  




 1. Boredom. Scenes that do not add to the characters, story, or tone and which are only there to stretch the movie to feature length. 
2. Annoying characters included either as comic relief or because people being shrill is supposed to be relatable.  




 Are you making a timelapse video?  




 That is some passive-aggressive, convoluted revenge.  




 Just yesterday foal Fluttershy posted a tutorial on how to mouse! 









 Eh, honestly I found it kind of boring. It had all the trappings of fun sci-fi but it just didn't know what to do with it.  




 What a twist. It's like Psycho.  









 I will stand by my belief that it's so over-the-top it circles back around and becomes funny again. Somewhere around the pointless electrocution.  




 I'm really looking forward to an all-female cast for this one! 









 Rarity felt like throwing up a second, smaller Fluttershy is how that's possible.
