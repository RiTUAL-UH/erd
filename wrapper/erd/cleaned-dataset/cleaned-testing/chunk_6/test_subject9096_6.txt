 Yep. I use the Ewok companion in The Old Republic and she is vicious.  




 Of course girls who like light sabers are a thing.  




 Ewoks are kind of brutal little murderers though. 




 Doesn't Christianity teach unconditional love? I wasn't raised Christian, so I can't be sure, but every time I see something like this I'm all "Aren't they supposed to love you anyways?" 




 These are guys I poundsurfed ages ago. Let me know if you want them. :D

 That doesn't add up. If you were my husband, and I really preferred you be home, I would come get you myself. 




 Hopefully this will "jumpstart" some new changes. I was on hiatus for two years and NOTHING CHANGED. Two years!! How are you supposed to maintain a userbase like that?

I feel bad for the people who lost their jobs. Hopefully it was only the bad apples, not anyone who really contributed. 




 I know that feel bro. HAIL SOUTHERN. 




 Are you in the US or Europe? That will help us narrow down which programs are available near you.

In the US, generally your bachelor's will be in Anthropology. 




 What a magical family moment that I guarantee will not be brought up repeatedly at your wedding. 




 The only thing that bothers me about 'pre-Clovis' is that the nomenclature presupposes that these earlier occupations eventually became the Clovis culture when they have just as much possibility of being something else entirely. 




 Stone tools didn't necessarily have a long life, no, but I like to think that if someone broke their big lovely spear point that they might reuse part of it as, say, a hide scraper. :) 




 Cahokia (and all other Mississippian polities) lacked a system of writing that we know of so *technically* not a civilization (although it meets all the other criteria). I tend to leave it at complex society and call it a day. There are many problems with the current definition of civilization, especially the implication that cultures that don't meet the criteria are 'uncivilized.' 




 The person who wrote that article knows jack shit about archaeology.

It is an intriguing find, however. 




 I am an archaeologist and my boyfriend and I have talked about getting tattoos on our ring fingers for when we are not wearing our rings. I definitely don't want to damage mine while working! 




 r/highschoolproblems 




 Yes. Do this. 




 fuckfuckfucfuckfuckfuckfuck 




 I'm considering the same, so I'm just gonna lurk here lol. 




 I vote for infected ingrown hair too. 




 Move relearner would do it I think. 




 I'm playing Pokemon Green now. It's hard because it's in Japanese lol. 




 CM says yes!

Now I have hope! I think I might get a new camera. We only have two park days, so $169 for pics makes me sad when I can get a new camera for that money, take my own pics and ask CMs to take pics of both of us. 




 I will not have Memory Maker though. I had been under the impression that you didn't need MM for these meals because the photos were included in the price.  




 Hi everyone, I have a couple character meals that traditionally include photos (whether you have MM or not) and I just read on a different forum conflicting reports about whether they stopped this at the beginning of the year or not. The ones I have booked are Akershus and Star Wars Galactic Breakfast. I'll be so disappointed to not get photos. :( 




 Huh, I didn't know that! Thanks! 




 Snap is the game I always wanted to play as a kid. Finally got it and a used 64 a couple years ago and was so happy. 




 Someone above said you could get the R/S one on the WiiU 




 Sadness! 




 Blue table FTW!

I never beat HAL's top score lol. 




 I would so buy a Gen IV pinball game!
 




 Yeah it took up premium space in my case lol. 




 The rumble on my cart stopped working. ;_; 




 The gameplay is very similar. The graphics, 'mons, and physics are updated of course and there are a couple more things to interact with on the table. Also Spoink shoots your pinball so you can control the speed of the ball, something which the original version lacks. Two thumbs up can recommend.

Does not rumble though. :( 




 Mine too! I saved so much for it and loved how it vibrated.

Actually I may have more hours on Diamond now that I think on it.

But back in the day, definitely. 




 Blue table for life. 









 Awesome :) 




 Wow how is that even legal? 




 The whole website was broken. I bet they are not all gone. 




 Mine is showing up in MDE now yayayay 




 I wonder if the poor cast members were all dreading today. 




 I got mine for when I wanted, but it's not showing on my reservations. I too am believing that my confirmation email means I am good! 




 If I was the random lady, I'd check the item in my trunk and try to contact the owner if the instrument had any contact info on it. 




 My boyfriend and I are going for our first trip together in May! 3 (70 days!!)

We are staying at POP Century and checking in on May 5th. Our first night there we are having dinner at Boatwrights at Port Orleans Riverside. Following that, my plan is to head over to the Polynesian for a Lapu Lapu at the Tambu Lounge while we watch Wishes from the beach. Then back home, since we have an early day the next day!

May 6th we have booked the Star Wars Galactic Dine In Character Breakfast at Hollywood Studios for 8:25 AM! I am SO EXCITED about this! My fastpasses for HS will include Toy Story, Tower of Terror and Star Tours. I'd also like to see the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular and MuppetVision 3D.

We are then park hopping to Epcot where we will drink and snack our way around the world showcase and flower and garden festival. Hopefully we can also ride Spaceship Earth! We have dinner reservations at Akershus after which we will find a spot for IllumiNations. RIGHT AFTER IllumiNations we will beat it to the Monorail and head to the Magic Kingdom. Hopefully we will arrive in time for Wishes! Seeing it from the Monorail height is pretty awesome. Finally, we will catch the Electric Parade then call it a night.

May 7 we will get up SUPER EARLY for EMH at the Magic Kingdom! I plan on filling myself with Mickey Waffles at the POP restaurant. Then we will try and get to the park in time for the opening show! My plan is to FP+ Peter Pan, 7 Dwarves, and Buzz Lightyear. I plan to head to Space Mountain first thing, do Buzz, then turn around and do Pirates, Haunted Mansion, then spend most of our time in Fantasyland getting all the major rides. We currently have lunch reservations for Tony's, but I am crossing my fingers I will be able to get Be Our Guest tomorrow! We will finish our day in the Magic Kingdom with the new Fantasy Parade.

After that, we will head back to Hollywood Studios! We will do any shows we missed the day before, Rockin Rollercoaster, Star Tours AGAIN! Then, we have dinner reservations at 50's Prime Time Cafe after which we can hopefully grab a seat at Fantasmic! Then finally we will head home and get to sleep in a little hehe.

May 8 we have a late AM breakfast reservation at Olivia's at Old Key West. Then we will take a boat to Downtown Disney where we will look around and shop. We have a late lunch reserved at Fulton's and dinner reservations at Raglan Road. We also have tickets to see Nightwish and Sabaton at House of Blues! :D

May 9- Checkout day. :( I want to walk over the bridge to see Art of Animation and have breakfast or lunch there before we leave.

We are celebrating our 1st Anniversary as a couple and are so excited. 3 




 Absolutely. Although, I must say I only use Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign out of the suite, so I can only comment on those. I was working at home on a magazine layout for work recently and the XPS navigated the file better than the 6 months old 27 inch iMac I have at work. I missed the big screen though hehe. I have not tried processing HUGE raster files with the XPS yet though. Just edited a batch of photos here at work and the response time was great. 




 I got it directly from Dell and upgraded the solid state to 256 mb. I have 8 gb of ram and the i5 processor. No touch screen. It's my first PC after being Mac only for 5+ years and I am very happy. 




 One looked like an abrader to me. 




 I do a lot of Photoshop/InDesign etc. at work and have downloaded CC for my XPS and the first thing I noticed is how FAST the programs open up. That's the solid state! I have never had my fan kick on when using the Adobe suite (yet). My fan kicks on only when I am using almost all of the CPU power. 




 In the US, most archaeologists have an anthropology degree because pedagogy over here follows Boas and the four fields approach. 




 So none of those look Paleo to me. They look Archaic/Woodland but it really depends on the part of the country they came from (context context context!) See if the historical society or one of your professors will help you get it recorded in the state site file. Or even better, perhaps there is a nearby professional firm that can help get it recorded. 

The thing is, the actual stuff you found may be cool and all, but it's a lot more useful to the scientific community when we can study the relationships between the artifacts and any features that may have been present. Remember, you can't put it back once its excavated! 




 Mine does it (ordered from Dell) but the fan only kicks on when I'm gaming, and I tend to have a headset on so I don't really notice it. 




 Actually not funny. 




 Nice 




 Starting Wednesday they will be taking lunch reservations for BoG. You should give it a shot!
