 So why do these people "like" Xbox on facebook if they're just going to do this? 




 I answer my phone with Ahoy-hoy, just like Mr. Burns. 




 In regards to physical media, how do I lose my games if my Wii U quits working on me?  I can still just buy a new system, just like I would have to do with the PS4 or Xbox1, and play all the games I previously purchased. 




 Can't say I've ever seen Father of the Bride.  But here's [Animaniacs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6_b0qhjpg) episode it's also in. 




 Hell yeah, Animainiacs reference!! 




 Makes you feel like you're defusing a bomb with all those colored ends. 




 I'm pretty sure it was asking what the worst game you've ever played was.  Otherwise you're just going off of what other people have said. 




 I have mostly stuck with just watching the Star Wars movies. But my friend said his 10 year old daughter asked this question about characters names in the Clone Wars. I tried doing some searching myself but can't seem to find anything. 









 Hey, I actually beat someone this weekend then with my 105! 




 All 5 of those guys are above 20 on ESPN so it has to be a different site. 




 I'm still surprised that Benny Parsons and Red Byron haven't been inducted yet! 




 I honestly think 5 per year is too many.  In 10 years the requirements to be on the ballot are going to be pretty low if you ask me.  Nascar doesn't have large teams like other sports do which gives them more options to pick from each year. 




 I'm still surprised Benny Parsons hasn't been inducted yet! 




 Two of my favorites are "Hold on" by Korn and "Lose Yourself" by Eminem.  I tend to prefer more upbeat paced songs for my entire runs too. 




 I've been there several times and as long as you're about 20 rows up or more you can see the entire track fine pretty much anywhere.  From there it's basically what part of the track you would prefer to sit near for the different action. 




 So are you trying to deplete all your funds within the first few races?  Haha 




 I don't see Gordon doing a part time schedule along the lines of Mark Martin.  If anything I think he would be in just a handful of races a year if he did go the part time route. 




 I had that about 2 years ago with a group of kids about 10 years old.  I thought to myself, "do they even know who Forrest Gump is?" 




 Would this be it?

 To go along with this, if a number is slanted forward on the drivers side, then it will be slanted backwards on the pasengers side of the car.  They keep the standard look of the number regardless of where it's placed on the car. 




 I'm pretty sure Jeff Hammond is just FOX's bitch and they send him to the worst spots around the track to do a 10 second segment just to fuck with him. 




 I don't mind Bowyer myself, but for some reason my brother just hates him. 




 That's true, but if you think about it, while the air titans are on the track that would most likely mean that the surface is too wet to even want to have the cars out there yet to help dry it. 




 I wish I was BIG!! 









 Ha, now that would be interesting to see. Actually I just want to see Jr. Wreck. 




 Thanks. That's what I was looking for. 




 I know Hamlin would get the points for the race since he starts, but who,s name would actually be listed as the race winner? 




 I agree.  If he wins 2 races he'll essentially be in the chase since the guys he mostly racing against for 20th are second tier teams.  And the past 2 years with the wild card only had 1 driver each year with more than 1 win not in the top 10. 




 I went with 2 of my brothers last year and we got there around 3pm.  It would have been sooner, but my brothers aren't too motivated to get up in the morning and our hotel was in downtown Charlotte.  We didn't have any trouble with parking.  It was about half a mile south of the track in a free lot.  I would recommend getting there sooner though if you feel like walking around and being able to check out a good amount of the stuff there. 




 When someone says that NASCAR isn't a sport because it's just cars driving in circles, I usually bring up the fact that they are just dumbing down what is actually going on.  If you explain basketball or football like that, then both of those sports are just running up and down a court/field tossing a ball around.  Doesn't sound too exciting that way.  Same with baseball, it's just guys standing around 95% of the time scratching themselves with someone throwing a ball every once in a while.  At least in NASCAR there's action going on 100% of the time during a race.  Granted some of the action is better than other times.  But essentially no other type of sport can make that claim.  Another point I'll make is that the majority of the NASCAR driversa are just as in shape, if not better, than a lot of athlese in other sports.  If this doesn't get through to them to at least acknowledge you have to be athletic to race, then they are just being ignorant. 




 I would say pretty much anything by Pantera except this song.  Mostly because it's the ONLY song by them that a radio station will play. 




 My brother and I still think of the rocking chairs that FOX gave both Mark and Rusty in 2005 for their retirements.  Rusty has been rocking away in his chair just waiting on Mark to retire and finally use his too. 




 I noticed this in the Texas race results too.  Except Dave Blaney was one of the 4 in a row. 




 Can someone tell me why Truex was penalized on pit road earlier? I thought the announcers said it was because the crewmen weren't over the wall before he left the pit stall.  But I've never heard of that before. 




 Brilliant! 




 I didn't think they were picked as the random car for inspection for the races after Talladega.  I thought NASCAR said they were going to inspect his car along with the other standarad cars that get picked. 




 I'll be down there this weekend for my first Martinsville dogs. 









 I think it's entirely possible.  Through 5 races he currently has 145 points, and Ryan Newman in 20th has 121 points.  If you figure the person in 20th roughly doubles their points over the next 5 races that would give them 242.  So Hamlin would only be maybe 100 points out of 20th when he returns.  He will need 2 wins for sure, possibly 3 to get a wild card spot in the chase though. 









 I would have to say the [T-Rex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkEVKzZNQDY) is the best demo on the original Playstation. 




 Hopefully it's not rain for the entire day.  Then we can finally see the new track dryers in action! 









 You have an initial budget of $100 and need to buy 5 drivers.  You can either try to buy 5 guys in the middle of the pack to have an overall good group.  Or you can spend the big bucks and get a top driver or two, but then sacrafice it by having to pick at least one lower level crappy driver to be able to afford all of them.  If your driver's value goes up, then you can sell them at a higher level than you bought them at and your entire salary cap increases.  For example: You buy someone that costs $20 and after 3 weeks they now are worth $21.  If you sell them, then your total salary cap will go up by $1.  But the same is true for drivers who go down in value.  You can sell them at a loss and take a hit, or you can try to ride them out and hope their value goes back up.   




 Walmart almost decided to become a primary sponsor for Jeff Gordon just a few years [ago](http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2010-08-24/walmart-in-negotiations-to-sponsor-jeff-gordon).  Not sure on the reason off hand for why the decided against it. 




 I doubt walking from the track to call a cab would make much difference.  At least I wouldn't think so from the way things looked to me last year. 




 My brothers and I went to the All Star race and Coke 600 last year for the first time.  Our hotel was downtown Charlotte and we drove to each of the races.  Basically for driving I took it easy to drive back each night.  Cooler sized for the track are 14" cube and it can be a hard or soft cooler.  As for leaving, once the race was over we hung out around our poarking lot for about 45 minutes which is about when traffice was starting to get thinner in our lot (still a LOT faster than Michigan takes to clead out).  So a cab probably won't work the best for leaving the track.  If your hotel is in the track area, you may be able to just walk the distance depending on where it is of course. 




 Wow, I don't know how I never realized that from all the times I've watched it. 




 * Korn - Follow the Leader
* Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine
* Live - Throwing Copper 




 It's plumber action man! 




 Not really a big party or anything, but about 12 or so people were in my apartment drinking when I was in college.  The outside doors were closed since it was fairly cold outside.  Someone came in and went straight to the kitchen fridge.  He heads back out the door with our ketchup in his hands and says "now all I need to do is find a hot dog" and left.  We were all just kinda in shock wondering what the heck just happened. 




 Women shopping for groceries. 




 Agreed.  I was thinking the same thing. 




 I agree the new setup is terrible.  I use Jayski.com and msn.com for most of my news.  And for some odds and ends stuff I go to racing-reference.info 




 MY MANWICH! 




 Fuck you replacement friends! 




 What about the mornings you don't wake up? 




 I believe I did. 




 Kind of the opposite with a city boy moving to the country side, but Son in Law.  Pauly Shore!! 




 And it still is a number. 









 Ikaruga on the Gamecube 




 Or possibly live out a real life Idiocracy. 









 While I find this stuff interesting, can anyone explain how a telescope like this can be focused on such a specific area for hours as the article mentions?  Wouldn't the rotation of the earth have an effect on it?
