 Makers of beer do need microbiologists with sensory training. Brewmaster microbiologists can easily identify strains of yeast or bacteria just by smell.

As this paper showed, microbiologists could also help with brewery design, especially microbreweries  - as building materials, spatial area, indoor conditions  such as airflow, humidity, and personnel traffic - are all very important.  



















 True, you can use only ingredients you want. Traditional breads and pitas don't have emulsifiers. Italian chocolate Domori doesn't have them either.
