 More details:
It is Polish minister of defence - Tomasz Siemoniak

And on the right Polish president - Bronisaw Komorowski.

Reaction is to statement that new NATO force HQ is going to be located in Poland - however later on he said that was because of wrong translation - and he have hear "forces will be located where they will be needed".

Same + great music. 




 Every time I look at all those people in the background I'm all like "Do you even pray Duarte??"

EDIT: relevant nick above. 




 Anybody with white PBTs can say how fast they get dirty?

I was always wondering about that.

EDIT: I just realized that somebody already ask that question, but didn't get any answer about getting dirty. 




 Yes, it is good, same as Rapid - just full size layout.

In that price tag you wouldn't find anything better.
You can also look up rosewill rk 9000, which is also considerate as one with good quality/price ratio.  




 You didn't specify layout, as I'm a TKL guy...

CoolMaster Quickfire Rapid - good, "standard", cheap (one of cheapest), and same manufacture as Filco.

Other than that - Leopold 660M, to Europe is one of cheapest options if you like such layout. So which keyboard is "the cheapest" depends on that where you live.

For example in Poland SteelSeries is one of cheapest (90$), and next is Razer BW Tournament (120$). In Europe you should also check Das Keyboard as it might be good option to go. 




 Whoa, that is interesting!
Look at "mayo, mayonnaise" and it seems that mayo comes from ~1860!
 









 Yeah, I'm fully aware that system of ratings is "dumb" and Google could easily make it better, but still it doesn't justify such garbarage reviews.

What's more I also get review such "Hello" (1-star), and "You won't look at it if I gave 5 stars. Great app!" (1-star).

Which was pretty sad for me as I also read 5 star ones. 




 Sorry but Google Play doesn't scroll down to review itself.
[Here is pic of it.](http://imgur.com/oLlCYjs.jpg) 









 You should be able to do so. 




 Because it uses Google Calendar as source of information of you events in next 12 hours.
And if you don't have it - app won't get that information. 




 I will!

I'm very eager to do that, and as well I'm going to IO so... it would be done as soon as they are going to release it. 




 Thanks I will test few configurations on my friends mobile, and include that in next update.

However less pixel density widgets in app (settings, and list of widgets) is done on purpose. 




 Please specify phone details, I will see because there is small algorithm that adapts resolution of drawing to your phone. Because otherwise on 1/4 devices you would get errors, memory overflow etc. 




 Did you updated from previous version? If yes please reinstall - for some people it was solution, however I tested and didn't notice it.
If not please mail me(mail is in the app), describe step by step what you do and where it fails, also please specify details of phone/system.
**I would appreciate all of people who have such issue to do that** - as I would love to solve it but it is as a riddle because on my 5 test phone everything is ok. 




 Maybe some of you remember [my widget \(12Hours\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tajchert.hours) that I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1uvt84/made_a_clockwidget_with_events_marked_as_colored/) 4 months ago.

After a long time I have done bigger update that add thinks such:

* Languages (Polish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French).
*  **More than one instance of a widget** - go and put 12Hours everywhere!
*  Second custom touch action for a widget.
*  **Custom colors!**
*  New skins (and more yet to come).
*  Wizard when adding a widget
* Optimization and code cleaning so next features will take less time.

I know that there is still much to do, but would love (as last time) feedback and advice on what features I should focus on, and what you would like to change.

That is my "thank you" for you guys, as only because of you it became popular (around 130k downloads).

disclaimer I would take a look at each (even down voted ones) ideas and opinions but things will be implemented not earlier then 2-3 weeks, because I discovered (by making that widget) that it isn't good to write code in a rush./disclaimer

EDIT: I have made some **G+ group** with access to beta releases and to discuss new functionality, submit your layout to include into app etc. -[HERE](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108716578003125422667) 




 If you are a tech person - check out smart.exea.pl

Is it worth moving there? It depends in what sector you are looking for a work. 














 Can you provide link to that group buy? It looks quite interesting and if price ain't high - well, why not? 




 The same as any other subject but it is a wrong subject. 




 I would suggest as most people here - go for it, as it is best moment to do so at your life (and later on it would be only worst).
But don't rely on nursing job in Poland - English teacher would be a better choice, and if possible try to merge those two - look at Medicover/Lux Med (private clinics) as they possibly are looking for such people (or maybe translating medical literature to Polish, or teaching medical students).

Good luck! 




 So... like any cinema in Europe?

Only booze is 18+ not 21. 









 Seriously?

Aren't websites for that? Like providing information about you, your portfolio, projects etc. you know, stuff like that...

Are we going to spam Google Play with thousands of our portfolios apps?
