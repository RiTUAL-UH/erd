 When I worked in a bakery, we always used a water bath and baked them between 250-300F. Never had any problems with cracking.   




 I'm 24(f) dating someone 36(m). Nothing wrong with it. Two consenting adults dating is a very normal thing.   




 I've been a coffee drinker for awhile,  but am just starting to really get into coffee. I have a Chemex pour over that I enjoy, but still purchase ground coffee from local coffee shops. I saw on the wiki page that Hario was mentioned as a good under 50 grinder. I received the Hario MM2 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004QWMAII/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?qid=1419718375sr=8-4pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 for Christmas.  Will this work for a pour over,  or should I exchange it? Thanks! 




 Received a Kindle Fire HDX for Christmas from my parents....I can't change the background because it has ads.  




 He won't let us go to bed without one last kiss right before falling asleep. And first thing in the morning I kiss him.  I love that we start and end each day with a kiss.  




 Lady shaver here.  When I first started I did short strokes and took it slow,  especially around my knees and ankles. But now I find that I can get a good shave with just 1 pass ATG on my legs. I do one long stroke to shave the length of my lower leg, and one long stroke to shave my thighs. I still tend to do short strokes on my knees because I have a tendency to cut myself there. I love my razor and I'll never go back. I've never had as close of a shave as I do now.  




 How does this shit work? Are regular Starbucks employees expected to perform cream art in peoples drinks? Is this difficult? I don't get it. Seems like a huge pain in the ass, day in-day out. Even if this is an indie place or something, do you charge more because goons expect you to draw shit in their coffee drinks?

I worked at an independent coffee shop for a while and started teaching myself how to do latte art. It isn't difficult, just takes time and practice. We weren't required to do it, but did it because it was fun, competitive with other baristas, and made the work day more interesting. Most customers don't expect it, but it's great to see the smile and surprise on their face when you hand their coffee to them. No extra charge.  It doesn't really take any extra time. You need to pour the milk into the espresso anyway, why not do it in a fun way. :) 




 Wow. Someone seems to have a stick up their ass. The food industry isn't for everyone, and obviously you aren't cut out for it. Some of us do enjoy the long days and take pride in what we do. Some culinary schools are a waste and some are actually really good. It's amazing networking, it gets you in a kitchen cooking faster than working up from a dishwasher to a chef, and you can be introduced to so many more techniques and varieties of foods than working in a restaurant because you aren't limited to just the theme of the food at the restaurant. 




 Love that you're watching Gilmore Girls. 




 Same. I get that it sucks to have someone steal your clothing, so I always return hoodies, hats, etc. Typically the guy is so surprised that I'm willing to give it back that he gives me one for keeps. I now have a shelf full of basketball shorts, tshirts, hoodies, and hats that are from exes.  I don't tend to wear them unless it's a sports team or something that I'm into. 




 That's how I love mine. I put them in a crock pot with some butter, mustard,  and some seasonings.  Let it cook on low for a few hours. They are nice and tender but not mushy. So good!  




 Mod Podge is typically a waste of money.  Use liquid Elmer white glue and water. Do a 2:1 ratio.  Mix well. Several art students and craft store employees have encourage people to use this cheaper method that works just as well. 




 My first DE razor was a schick krona and I loved it. I just bought my little sister a Parker 29L for Christmas and although she hasn't received it yet, it does have a nice long handle that gives a good grip.  




 Awesome!  




 Fair enough.  




 Nice. I've been keeping my eyes out at garage sales and estate sales too, just in case there is anything good. 




 I've seen a range of prices. At this same shop they had a gold razor that looked like a double edge, but only had one edge to it and had little comb things sticking out - it was about $20. They also had some travel ones with a case and other little things in it, but were upwards of $30 so I passed on those. 




 Thanks! It's the second razor I've purchased. Both have been at antique stores. Unless I'm specifically looking to purchase a certain razor, I'll probably just continue purchasing randoms at antique stores and other resale shops. Seems to be the places to get the best deals :) 




 I used a toothbrush and some soap to do the initial clean, some scrubbing bubbles, and then rubbing alcohol to kill anything that was left.   




 It adjusts the blade so you can get a more or less aggressive shave. 




 If you don't mind me asking, what settings do you use? 




 Looks like I'll have to play around with it :) 




 Female here who doesn't shave her face. I'm assuming same thing goes for legs and such. :) 




 Thanks!  




 Will do! Thanks :) 




 Awesome advice! Thank you :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Thanks! 

I've never used a razor with adjustable settings. Where is a good starting point?
