 The only person in the world who compliments me is the gay local baker who gives me free bread. I'm straight, but I'm perfectly ok with him hitting on me. Everyone else should be the same.  




 I'm more concerned that they didn't just ask YOU.  




 He looked down. I saw him.

The bastard.  




 While it's really nice to have some people saying we look attractive for once, I can't help but notice that all of the attributes described are of men that are basically models. That's fine - models are attractive for a reason - but I think it's interesting that females are born with their most attractive sexual features (breasts, hips, etc) and improve upon these by building various muscle groups/maintaining a certain level of body fat, but men are largely born without the muscles and more importantly the substantial self-confidence that is critical to the perception of an attractive male. These things need to be worked for. I wonder if that has contributed to the current dating system of men approaching women, who then appraise their value and accept them - being undeniably in control as the gatekeepers of sexual intercourse in our society - rather than the other way around.  




 While that's all very true, I personally would categorise makeup and clothing as (albeit very important) external modifications which are to some extent masks, whereas exercise and building muscle is changing your actual body. 

This is important because a man with a sexually attractive body is attractive all the time, and knows he is - whereas women who feel that they are only attractive with makeup (despite the fact that they're probably fine without it) can become very dependent on it for their self esteem and feel uncomfortable or exposed without it.  




 Well that's a poor attitude  




 I think it should be pointed out that no one should now refer to men as 'males.' 




 I think it's interesting that women are largely born with their looks, and other than staying skinny, can't do that much to change them. Men, however, can all physically (aside from their face) be attractive or hideous based on muscle mass, body fat etc.

Furthermore, as girls are born with their looks, if they've been skinny all their lives they haven't really worked for it at all. They are just innately attractive, and I think that must affect their self-esteem and -perception quite a bit. Men, however, must work hard to be attractive. This also extensively applies to their attitudes and their confidence - women's personalities usually come as at least passable with no effort at all. 




 Off to /r/fitness with you! 




 Eat carbohydrates. Lots of them. 




 Out of curiosity, why are you being downvoted? 




 About 70% of my friends are female, including both of my best friends.  




 Depends where you live. Usually only the major cities of various countries.

See if your city has a subreddit.  




 Potterghost's post had nothing to do with this.  




 Just because a mental illness is being treated doesn't mean that it instantly goes away, or that its symptoms don't manifest.  




 As someone with a diagnosed mental disorder, we're not all bad 




 Mods should sidebar this forever. It applies year round, not just to New Years'. 




 Unfortunately, I don't have a Labrador. So not really. But thanks anyway.  




 Labrador = laidbrador 




 I am a singer. You need to be even more careful that you're not forcing yourself to sing out of your range - especially below your range, which is much harder to tell than a cracked top note - because of the greater forces involved on your vocal cords and surrounding muscles.  




 Because he's being downvoted and does have a relevant point (which he presented in the wrong way), I will repeat it here. 

THIS ARTICLE IS NOT ABOUT ARTIFICIALLY CHANGING YOUR VOICE. THIS WILL DAMAGE IT.  




 whip your shirt off and it's no big deal

Only if you're skinny and muscly.  




 birth control

The risk of deliberate pregnancy here is extreme.  




 you and her will probably grow apart

And that's exactly what she's afraid of.  




 The worst is trying to slim down and bulk up. I hate being overweight but (or so I've been told by several females) my body will be worse as a stick than a bit fat, so I can either bulk now and put on muscle while still having a poor body and a terrible opinion of myself, or I can slim down to a point where I'm happy with myself but no one else is, and then start the long process of improving while taking the unattractiveness hit.  




 I get the impression you're not really a fan of anything. Maybe that's why you have no success with women.  




 Knee is being an entitled dickhead. Ignore him, you have just as much right to offer your opinion to further the conversation as he does.  




 Just because you're offering your opinion doesn't mean that they can't continue the thread with theirs.  




 But your headshots are amazing. 

... you could be a porn star 




 Hey man. I'm in the same place as you and currently working on it, and I'm much happier for it. Have a read through /r/confidence, /r/faimprovment, and /r/seduction and see if there's anything that encourages you to work on your confidence - unfortunately the only person who can improve that is you, but I know you'll feel better about the whole world if you do. Just my two cents.  




 "And lo, the Lord did inherit the looks of Mary, who was but a HB3, which explains she was still a virgin." 




 If you don't define 2.5 to 7.5 as 'much larger,' I think you need to reconsider some statistics. Such as the fact that the average penis is between 5-5.5 inches in length.  




 Sidebar please? 




 scalete

Escalate 




 Seeing as this post is about calibration, it might be worth adding something to start to explain why you pursued an aggressive approach based on your initial calibration of the situation.  




 Twist: he's Barney Stinson 




 It's also showing that you have value to other women (I forget the exact term), which instantly gives you much greater value, because if you dodge that question then you're either sleeping with lots of other people or you're an AFC. And she can't get the AFC impression from the 'alpha' personality he has displayed so far.  




 What in hell have you the impression that social interaction was fair for both genders? 




 2-3 times bigger is still a lot. For a guy that's 2.5 inches flaccid - pretty small - he'll be 7.5 in no time.  




 Ok, thanks for clarifying. I had meant that exchange to be via text when planning the date - perhaps as a reply to "let's meet tomorrow at (bar)" for example - does this change anything? 




 This may be a really dumb idea, but after attempting to make plans with a girl, if she responds with 'is this a date?' could you say something like 'do you want it to be?' - to indicate both that you want it to be a date and gauge her level of enthusiasm/attraction to you? Or would a more direct approach like a straight up 'yes' be a little more... alpha (for want of a better word?) 




 And then link them to it every time it's the only appropriate answer to the question.

If we added 'Girls: it is okay to ask out guys' to /r/askmen, and the list of typical body language for when girls are interested in guys to /r/askwomen, reddit's traffic would decrease so much the servers would actually work.  




 I highly recommend posting this to /r/seduction. They'd probably sidebar it.  




 Definitely. Look up, find someone you like, make eye contact and smile at them. 

If he doesn't come over he's gay or married.  




 Upvoted as a guy with no male role model who didn't know other kids got taught this for free.  




 I don't suppose you're African royalty of some kind? 




 Hey look, it's that time of week again! 

Seriously, can we sidebar or FAQ this damn topic? 




 How old are you? It could be an age/maturity thing (their fault, probably age related) or you could be becoming complacent, unexciting, or unattractive in the relationship. 




 I would think that using dishonest or sleazy to describe 'nice guys' is probably a bit over the top. Perhaps misguided or misunderstanding what women actually want/find attractive.  




 Everything about you and your username drips with douche. 

Are you familiar with the Dunning-Kreuger Syndrome? 




 Breaking news - people of the same gender don't necessarily like the same things! 




 daDAdadada 




 Hey man, welcome to reddit. I don't think /r/seduction is quite the place for people who are new to dating altogether - though definitely stick around - but you might try /r/datingadvice or possibly /r/relationshiptips.  




 RED ALERT

ASSASSIN IN THE BUILDING 




 I thought the point of this thread was that the perfect pickup artist didn't exist. Then you go and show up.  




 Absolutely. 'You should be wearing makeup,' therefore if you're not wearing makeup you're not good enough, so wearing makeup makes you innately acceptable and comfortable.  




 I think women use makeup as a social and self-esteem prop - it makes them feel better, and they feel exposed without it - just the same as many men do with alcohol or hair gel. They feel lacking or less than their average selves without it as a shield.  




 I reckon he was done in ten and watching tv or something for the rest of the time.  




 so she would constantly get things wrong

I would find this adorable.  




 Was? What happened? 




 Dragovich... Kravchenko... Steiner... all must die.  




 Well, with any luck, your SO will then appreciate and thank you for putting in so much effort in that way.  




 Civilian here. You're ready a lot braver than 99% of your country, please stop fighting each other and focus on coming home.  




 Relevant noob question: if there is a girl who I am not interested in initially for whatever hypothetical reason, and I become friends with her instead but then become interested later on as I get to know her - having displayed no attraction and made no moves up to this point, and assuming she has displayed none of the same - could I then display interest, escalate, etc etc and her actually be interested? Assuming I did everything right and that she hypothetically found me attractive enough when we first met that if I had put the moves on it would have worked, would a few months of friendship forever close that door? 




 In all seriousness, have you considered depression? (Do you have any reasons to consider depression?) 




 What could possibly go wrong? 




 Not sure if sarcastic...
