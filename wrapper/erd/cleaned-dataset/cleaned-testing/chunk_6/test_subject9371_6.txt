 **The Good**

Leave for my 'evaluation' this week.

**The Bad**

Downloaded that *Zombies, Run!* app and tried to run obsessively even though my body can't handle it at my severely underweight BMI. How am I ever going to get to do cross country like I always wanted to do in high school? *sigh*

**The Ugly**

I still have no hobbies except for goofing off of the Internet and crying. Can't even stop long enough to watch anime. But I'll be on a road trip tomorrow so I'll try and force myself to unplug and read my massive pile of library books.
