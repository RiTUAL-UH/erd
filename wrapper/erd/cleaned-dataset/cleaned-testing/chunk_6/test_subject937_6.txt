 Amazing transformation. How differently do people respond to you now as opposed to then? 




 She clearly says this is not my client.

Where? The article and news report both state he was her client.

Edit: Also, as to your third point, they were clearly outside of court and likely had just attended some sort of preliminary hearing. What authority backs up your assertion that this scenario qualifies as an "ongoing police investigation"? I ask because your admonition about commenting without knowing the law implies that you yourself actually do. 




 Wow. That is absolutely absurd. This cop needs to be fired yesterday. 




 I know several who seem to think their opposition to marriage equality makes them more acceptable to mainstream society.

Plea for acceptance essentially (and unfortunately). 




 I submitted a claim about my watch and forwarded about a dozen pictures (as requested). I have not received any response despite following up every week for 4 weeks. Not even an acknowledgement of receipt.

I opted out of arbitration so will be sending Motorola a demand letter this week, followed by a lawsuit, to enforce the warranty.

Their customer service is shit in my experience. Utter shit. 




 Mods, please delete. The other thread is better sourced. 




 I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion judges in this area are elected.

Edit: Nope, looks like my suspicion was incorrect. 




 This doesn't surprise me. I post all the time but rarely publicly.

Do people post publicly on Facebook on a regular basis (non-celebrities and such)? 




 _Directly_ create 140 jobs. Those people will participate in the economy which will create additional jobs. The local businesswoman quoted in the article is an example of this.

I've been using "judicial smackdown" but I'll be using this from now on. 




 He said "many", and he's correct. A sizeable percentage of Americans watch it like it is the Bible on TV. 




 I agree. Those of us with a fine, South-Augusta-redneck pedigree couldn't be happier about the prospect. 




 That's not why I use it. There are great communities on Google+. 




 I assume its manufacturing based on the proposed location, but I really have no idea.

There's a local redditor who works for The Augusta Chronicle but I forget his name. Perhaps he has some info. 









 Don't forget the Necessary and Proper Clause.

Take each one of the enumerated powers and add every power necessary and proper to exercise them and you have the full breadth of federal power.

Given the history of the Confederate States, that power is large by design. 




 I use it as a phone book. Easy to just write the first few letters of a name. 




 I may be interested but not for a few months. I'm currently running each morning and using my diet to shed fat. I plan on getting back into the gym around late Spring/early Summer.

I am a member at Anytime and will be looking to workout in the mornings. If you've found a partner, perhaps I could join y'all. 




 It has been limping along for years (at least two foreclosure sales). Without this partnership, the PI may have been lost completely. 









 I just can't wrap my head around how anyone can believe both (1) their god is a loving, just god and (2) their god condones execution of children for watching soccer.

 I say 6-3. The CJ may vote with the majority so he can write the opinion. 




 Damn that's beautiful. 




 The 12th Amendment arguably prevents this. You're not eligible to run for the Vice Presidency unless you're eligible to run for the Presidency. 




 I didn't realize until yesterday (for whatever reason) that it works alongside Gmail and doesn't _replace_ it. Tried it out last night and it looks promising. 




 I think that's an exception. Same goes for Nacho Mama's. 




 It's funny how you don't realize something is structurally annoying like this until someone else says it. That button needs to be moved. 




 Oh shit. I was resisting inbox but this makes me rethink that. 




 Let's all remember this when competition forces them to provide decent service. When fiber comes to Augusta, Comcast won't be able to keep me as a customer even if they offer it to me for $1/month. 




 Huh - color me shocked. Maybe they did do it intentionally, haha. (But not out of support for marriage equality, but out of a desire to put this issue to rest once and for all.) 




 My point is that the Sixth's decision may end "justice delayed" quicker than it would have ended otherwise. Without a split, it would have undoubtedly taken longer than June 2015 for all Americans to obtain marriage equality.

Do I think the Sixth intentionally created a split because they secretly support marriage equality? No. 




 And Spanish. But that's the joke. 




 I guess it depends where. I have great coverage and 4G. 




 I don't understand why people don't use Sprint. Literally. I don't understand. Everyone I personally know who doesn't bitches about data caps and expensive plans, yet refuses to switch to Sprint. My cousin wasn't responding to my texts and I finally found out he turns data off or something. I don't even know where to turn data off...

It's mind-boggling to me. 




 Scumbag Sixth Circuit is actually Good Guy Sixth Circuit. 




 Chiron Technology Services just [announced](http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2015-01-16/cybersecurity-contractor-opens-center-augusta?v=1421425394) an office in West Augusta. 









 General incumbency "stickiness" applies to judges, too. And since the public rarely sees anything they do (unlike a legislator who has an easily accessible voting record), it takes a massive screw up for the public to form a negative opinion about a judge. 




 Even assuming that is done in every election, I highly doubt enough people read it to beat out the legal community. 




 As long as the term is long enough, this really won't be a problem. It doesn't have to be a lifetime appointment but as long as it's long enough for there to be turnover in the legislative and executive branches, the pandering will end the day the judge is sworn in. 




  It is not unforeseeable that community leaders would just appoint judges who will do what they want.

The governor of the state would likely be the person appointing judges. Judicial elections are awful. Generally, the electorate has no idea who is a good judge or who would make a good judge. The end result is that the local legal community (i.e., the "community leaders" you fear would be in charge were judges appointed) decides who wins. And that is a very tainted process.

Edit: I'd also like to point out that many states - like mine - have a hybrid system. If a judge retires before the expiration of his or her term, the Governor appoints his or her replacement. What's the net effect? Almost every judge retires before the end of their term. And since incumbent judges almost never lose, we essentially have an appointment process already.

Edit2: Also, even assuming races will be competitive, what is the likely pool of candidates? Attorneys. This means that if you run against a judge or lose in an open election, you run the risk of facing a less-than-favorable judge in court. This greatly discourages competitive races in places where judges are elected. 




 Alright, reddit. Tell me why this one isn't anything to get excited about. 




 Man I thought Thomson was set to be the next city absorbed into "Augusta". How fast is shit growing out there?! 




 Why do you think that follows? 




 This is just how we do things here.

No it isn't. _See_, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. How we _actually_ do things here is to weigh rights versus state interests. If your religion requires that you murder your child for being raped, that is outweighed by the state's interest in preventing murder.

It's a complicated constitutional area but a good starting place is to Google "levels of scrutiny constitutional law". 




 None of the rights in the Constitution is absolute. For example, your religion may sanction honor killing, but murder is still illegal and that doesn't violate the First Amendment.

Southern Baptists thought interracial marriage violated their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean interracial couples must cede their rights to marriage equality.

It's a lot more complicated than your post implies. 




 You can contact the Ronald McDonald House. Also, the Augusta Pride festival always needs volunteers. 




 Don't you get it? Ending segregation was way more racist than segregation itself. 




 Every business benefits from the public. My gay tax dollars help fund the massive Navy that allows a basement business to get widgets for 5 cents each. 




 Requiring tolerance of intolerance is a false equivalence. There is most definitely a relevant distinction between wanting a cake that is pro-slavery versus one that is pro-Civil Rights.

We don't have to pretend that all views are equal. We can disagree, but some views are less valuable (pro-baby rape, for example). 




 I guess I just don't see it. I'm born and raised as well (except for school) but my parents attended Augusta College, as have countless friends and family.

To me, it's just a name. I also don't get upset when people do whatever to the American flag. It's just a flag. And if the choice is between a great school without "Augusta" in its name, and a lesser school with it, I would choose the former without a thought. I don't think that was the choice but damned if everyone wasn't ready to torpedo the merger just to save the name.

And you're right, I don't have much patience for Augusta hate. But I don't see this as having anything to do with that. Georgia State, Georgia Southern, UGA, Mercer, Emory, etc., don't include the name of the city they are in, so it's not like Augusta was being singled out.

As for the level of involvement, I don't think it's beneficial in and of itself. Hell, this city went apeshit supporting Chick-fil-A as well and that was nothing more than bigotry. 




 That feature has [been around](http://imgur.com/SB3N5QO) for a few months, at least. 




 I've apparently read too much erotica. I was fully expecting this story to end with one of you bent over a bench.

So, yeah, keep us posted. 




 I'm sure not everyone will agree with me but I was put off by the level of outrage and effort given what was at stake. I saw more outward participation to "Save the A" than for any other campaign for any cause in the last few years. There were yard signs, bumper stickers, letters to the editor, rallies, etc.

To each his own but I don't think any reasonable argument can be made that "saving the A" was an even minimally important issue. 




 It's not an either-or thing. That was ridiculous, too. 




 Without making a statement on Azziz himself, the "Save the A" campaign was the most ridiculous thing I've seen in Richmond County in a long time. (I suspect there may be an equally ridiculous "Save the B" (Berckman's Road) in the near future.)

Pursuits don't get much more trivial than that. 




 Astroturfing. Probably copypasta from somewhere. 




 Damn 




 I think he would do a much better job than the other two candidates. He's got a lot of passion and a track record of getting things done (the latter being the most important, in my opinion). 









 That's not a realistic way to change the outcome and get quality candidates.

Vote. History is full of examples of it working. 




 What? You're talking to someone you made up, not me. I was pointing out that not voting has an impact on an election.

If a candidate loses, it's usually not only because the other candidate got more votes. Turnout is a huge factor. 




 If I recall correctly, he is embarrassed of those and doesn't want them to be seen.

Therefore, thank you for posting them. 




 I'm sure the larger companies would figure it out. But I would think the IRS would be skeptical of any system that completely avoids the purpose of the tax rate. 




 Ah, yes. If I recall there are several factors the IRS will look at. 




 But the CEO of a company paying out $10 million isn't likely to be an owner eligible to take distributions, correct?

I own a small business and pay myself distributions. My accountant advises me to keep it close to 50-50. If I were to pay myself a larger distribution, I would essentially have to pay myself an equivalently larger taxable salary (from what I understand). 




 Would it be a dollar for dollar thing? The company could create a class of shares and pay $10 million in dividends and it would result in the same cash expense as paying an additional $10 million in wages? 




 Do you have examples?

If the CEO was set to earn an additional $10 million, but $9 million would go to the government as taxes if paid in wages, what non-wage, nontaxable compensation can the business spend its cash on that rises to that level?

Edit: I'm not denying there are ways. I'm genuinely asking. 




 Not voting for his opponent means instead of a 0, he got a 1. 




 Vote in the midterms, not just the Presidential elections! 




 It sounds like it's working the same way a very high marginal tax rate would work. Few companies would actually pay their CEO an increased salary if 90% of it would go to the government. The money would instead be funneled back into the company. 




 "Blame" seems like an odd choice of words for a major cause of economic growth.

 For someone who can remember "from Grovetown" essentially meaning "country as hell", the growth of that area blows my mind. 




 Unisys is one that has already announced it is coming. 




 Isn't that just a question of degree? I mean, you agree it's ridiculous to punch someone for simply insulting a religion, right? 




 At a minimum, this is not true for a good chunk of gay men. 




 Great! Thanks for doing this.

Also, I edited my post because I accidentally put "July" instead of "June". 




 TIL this can happen.

 Hooray! I love /r/Augusta.

Can we reply with events? If so, [Augusta Pride 2015](http://prideaugusta.org) will be June 26-27. 




 I can't believe I didn't know this until now. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 




 I agree. The setup is ridiculous. I use my tablet in court and am very careful about making sure all sounds and notifications are off. With the update, I have to play a video to make sure that the sound is off...

Stupid, stupid, stupid... 




 The way you set up the quote makes it seem as if the two statements were made separately from one another but nope... same thought.

Can we fast forward to a world where people don't kill each other over religion? 




 According to MSNBC, the gunman appears to be a close friend of the previous shooters. 




 Probably for children who may not have reliable heat at home. 




 I went my entire public school education (K-12) in Columbia County and just can't remember. Perhaps it's too distant of a memory for me :( 




 Yeah, this may be overkill. But coming off of last year's ice storm, I can see why everyone is being extra cautious. Plus, I'm not sure school buses actually have heaters here...

It did snow tonight, though! 




 They have a giant billboard on Washington Road. 




 This discussion happens every time we get a bit of cold. The South does not prepare for wintry weather. It doesn't make economic sense.

New York doesn't prepare for earthquakes, Chicago for hurricanes, LA for blizzards, etc. 




 Anything more recent? That poll is almost three years old.

 I agree, but she doesn't look botoxed. 




 Sheriff Roundtree seems to be getting panned from all sides for this, mainly by jokesters. It's pretty clear what he meant though. Chick-fil-A has a reputation of quality customer service, cleanliness, fairness to employees, etc.

Chick-fil-A _as a fast food restaurant_ is very good quality. And I'm with everyone stating that the he has done a great job so far.

And if it's worth anything, I'm gay and generally avoid Chick-fil-A. But I recognize the quality. 




 Wait, is the next number always greater than the sum of the previous numbers by 1?

 Huh... TIL. Well, awareness is always important. 




 2015-01-01 




 I vividly remember reading the last one in the paper as a kid. "Life is a blank canvas, like fresh snow" - or something like that.

Damn good comic. Damn good. 




 This is probably my favorite meme. Maybe because I had a version of this conversation with my mom about Facebook for 5 years. 




 And a lot of gay ones.

Me included. 




 To be fair, his attorneys phrased it that way. Not her. 




 I think if one gets 100,000 signatures, the White House will "respond". 




  going out and maxing out credit cards on clothing and other non-seizable goods a few months before filing

If it's done with the intent of filing bankruptcy, yes, it's likely fraud. The difficult part is proving it. Plus, you're generally dealing with debts in the thousands so most major credit companies don't view it as a worthwhile fight (the big fraud fights I see are in Chapter 11s - business bankruptcies -  because the debts are in the millions).

It can be an embarrassing process but most people I run across view it in retrospect as a very simple process. The worst part is generally the self-inflicted shame.

Edit: And it sounds like you are on a much better path now: "No more credit card bills, and proper payment arrangements made with the doctors offices. I don't ever plan to do get into a mess like that again." 




 Or just file bankruptcy. 




 In my state, retirement accounts are fully exempt. As for cars, you get an exemption up to $5,000 (and many cars without liens are not worth that much). Home equity can be a problem but only if there is a lot of it. The court isn't going to force you to liquidate your house if the only creditor that will get paid is the mortgage company. 




 In practice, most people who file a Chapter 7 will not lose anything. Each state has bankruptcy exemptions based on categories of property. Any property up to the value of the exemption is protected from your creditors in bankruptcy. (The idea behind this is to prevent bankrupt individuals from simply becoming wards of the state.) 




 *in a Chapter 13.

A Chapter 13 is a repayment plan; a Chapter 7 is a liquidation. Judgments can be taken care of in both but in the latter, the judgment creditor will not get any payment.

In practice, most judgments are avoidable and the underlying debts dischargeable. 




 Bankruptcy attorneys who know what they are doing will require payment up front for a Chapter 7 (which sounds like what you filed). If not, the remaining fee is a pre-petition debt that gets stayed and discharged just like any other. Importantly, the client could potentially sue the attorney for violating the stay if any collection efforts are made (such as calling for a payment).

Of course, if you hire a bankruptcy attorney who agrees to a post-petition payment plan with the intention of not paying (because you now know the above), that's probably fraud and not dischargeable. 




 I think the point is that that's not exclusive to Atlanta, and doesn't not happen all over the country and the world (sorry for the double negatives but they are appropriate). Blaming a region really doesn't help the overall "greater good". 




 You don't deserve these downvotes. Homophobia is a national problem and implying this only happened because it was in the South is dangerous to LGBT people everywhere. 




 That's everywhere for you. Atlanta is incredibly gay friendly. 




 That's Joe's on Juniper... a very popular gay bar. I can't believe this happened there. 




 That was my immediate thought. You're done for now, OP! We're comin'! 




 I admit to having no technical knowledge, but, why is it so hard to do? It seems like we should be able to efficiently and cost-effectively track planes. 




 Oliviana's and Tako Sushi in Surrey Center are must-eats. Tako Sushi particularly during Masters week. Speaking of which, will 2015 be your first Masters? 




 Frog Hollow is simply amazing. 




 You'd probably change your mind if you weren't _not_ doing something in town (like playing video games at home - don't get me wrong, I love games, but that's not experiencing your city).

There's a ton of shit to do here.

 Everyone secretly wants that to happen, right?
