 This actually moved me to tears. Absolutely beautiful. 




 Dude, don't worry too much about that. It really is about the couple. My husband and I have been together for 9 years on the 25th and I make it an active point to give him blowjobs on the regular, usually during my period. I initiate them, and they're only for him. He returns the favor when I'm off, so the cycle of giving goes round and round. 




 Awesome!! I discovered Diet Bet because I follow Chris Powell from the tv show Extreme Weight Loss on Facebook. Apparently he and his wife host like 3 bets a year, and he posted on his FB page that the New Year bet was starting in a few hours. I researched it as much as possible, the FAQ and game rules have a lot of good info so I strongly recommend that you check those out. After I read everything I could, I paid the $30 buy-in knowing that I had 7 days to change my mind. The sign-up process is very straight forward, it can all be done through the website or the mobile app.

The motivation doesn't come from "oh I am going to get SO MUCH MONEY!" like you would expect, but I am stingy and wanted my $30 back lol. Mostly just know I had *very* clear goals in mind is what kept me in line. I got MyFitnessPal and followed my macros, and submitted unofficial weigh-ins weekly on the app. You're only required to do two official weigh ins on the day the bet starts the day it ends, but when you update weekly it tells you total pounds   ounces lost, how any you have to go till your goal weight and how many days till the final weigh in. It sounds so simple but having it spelled out like that in black   white was really critical for my success. 
You can join any bet within 7 days after the starting date, so if you want to join the one  I'm in now I'd be happy to send you the link.
I hope this answers your question and gives you more insight into the process!  




 Eating disorders alone are hard to get support for cause people don't take is seriously. Being a man and having an ED...that sounds impossible to people, like how people think men can't be raped. Men struggle too, all the time.

I think it's incredible you were able to overcome all of that seemingly on your own. You don't have to do it alone anymore, there's an entire community here willing to support you. Any time you feel like you're slipping, hit me up and I'll do whatever I can to help you out. 




 My first Diet Bet wrapped up yesterday. I bet $30 I could lose 4% of my body weight in 28 days. I lost 9 pounds,  making the cut by 1 ounce and won back $42! Because I was employed at the time I did my first bet and wasn't ready to stop the progress yesterday, instead of cashing out I used the winnings as credit to buy into another game. 

True that I had some anxiety in the says leading up to the last weigh in, but for the whole month I was VERY motivated to stay on track and keep up with my food log.

If things keep going this way, I can easily see myself continuing to do bets till I get closer to my goal weight as a way to develop solid habits and give myself a better reward other than food. 

If anyone joins I'd be happy to make a team and keep in touch!! 




   Binging, unless you purge, is laughed at by professionals

That's just sad, as if an eating disorder can only occur with both B   P. But that's exactly what I was afraid of people saying - that my problem last night wasn't real because I wasn't able to purge because of my surgery.

You're right, I can't reward myself with food. Logically I know it's not healthy to have that type of relationship with food, but it's so hard to let go of that mindset. I'll let you know how it goes when I figure THAT part out. 

Chin up, best of luck on your road to recovery and fitness, and thank you for your support. 




 It's so rare to hear something like that, most people scoff at these types of things. Thank you for the validation and support! 




 Thank you that makes me feel a ton better! I got used to immediate backlash in other subs, so I was worried. This really is the best subreddit I've ever seen. Thank you so much for your kind words and support! 




 Hell yeah, that's awesome! Keep it up, you got this! 




 Reddit - World's Best Clairvoyants Able to Detect if a Stranger is a Parent or Not 




 True that most kids just pratice willfull defiance and cover their asses but eventually most children will realize the stupid thing they want to do isn't worth the consequences. Every kid is different - each kid needs individualized child rearing - but humiliation is not a form of child rearing. It's just crule. 




 I just imagined OP trying to throw the snow back up into the sky. 




 Nah that's just parenting. Teaching a kid cause and effect, and that actions have negative consequences. That's totally different from humiliation. 




 Exactly! People forget they aren't just raising kids. They are shaping and molding a future adult and it's their job to make sure the kid isn't going to be a shitty adult. It's a terrible cycle. 




 Hell yeah, Geaux Cajuns!
