 The internet has kind of democratized book critics, it's also reduced the nature of cultural gatekeepers to rather dedicated readerships. But it's still funny to see grudge matches between critics and authors.

 The internet is the only place where you'll find a bunch of twenty somethings ignoring years of legal precedent and believe a slippery slope ends at something that would positively affect an online community's legitimacy. 

I don't know why Chris Hansen is sitting on his hands. These guys are seemingly throwing their hand out there.  




 As GamerGate continues to demonstrate to the world that the SJW emperors have no clothes (especially after today) the endgame is rapidly upon us as they will seek escalation into international banning, criminalization, and censorship of anything that isn't pro-narrative.

 Reddit is hopelessly in love with talking about itself.  




 Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:

[Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)

Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.

In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.

In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:

 gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."

Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.

But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.

Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.

It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.

Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:

[I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)

As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.

But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:

[Reddits Terrorists Have Won: Ellen Pao and the Failure to Rebrand Web 2.0](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/reddit-s-terrorists-have-won-ellen-pao-and-the-failure-to-rebrand-web-2-0.html)

Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.

Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.

Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.

 Submission History: The story of two Twenty-something kids, who are basically an internet version of True Detective, and their voluntary mission to hunt pedophiles.  





























 I have to watch 11-11-11 tonight. I've heard the score, but I never saw the movie.  




 You gotta talk about what it's like working with Joseph Bishara tomorrow. I'm really curious about what his work process is like. 




 Reliable Sources is a media commentary show. They can say pretty much whatever they want as long as they don't blatantly say something false like Bill O Riley reported 4 wars with a pen. 




 It is. Yishan is a guy known to fuck.

 Rob Zombie's next film is a bio pic period piece. Which is a weird thing to think of but that's how it be. 




 I wonder if M. Night is just riding the coattails of found footage to say later that his movies still bring in tons of money? Considering the low cost-high reward nature of these shit films it's pretty much written in the stars that his movie is going to make money. 




 Fuck. Minions 2 is gonna happen.

Is Insurgent considered a flop? That was a pretty fucking boring movie to make double its budget instead of three times it.

  After that movie came out and people saw the female leads doing badass shit with the male lead, they freaked out.

 I imagine it wouldn't look good with these two possible headlines.

"Former Reddit Employee with Cancer sued by Reddit for Breach of Non-Disclosure"

or

"Ex-Reddit Employee Fakes Cancer Claim to Blame Female CEO for Firing" 

This is what I was aiming at. Reddit is basically gonna make themselves like fools if they take action either way. It's better to let it slide...that is. Unless...Yishan wants to be responsible for some popcorn. 




 [It sounds like he doesn't give a shit anymore](https://twitter.com/yishan/status/619657668261601280) 




 [This popcorn keeps coming. I can't handle it.](https://i.imgur.com/NvhhMqC.jpg) 




 Basically it means that Yishan can freely beat around the bush and Reddit can't really do much. But I was talking about the inevitability that Reddit would go after Yishan for making innocuous statements about how Reddit handled a very public situation because of a nondisclosure provision. I don't even know if he signed one. He would probably have been the one to make the decision on whether to have one. 

It would make Reddit look worse to their user base who will see Yishan as a whistle-blower and in the press because those statements from Yishan are going to get signal boosted. I imagine that if push comes to shove, and with Yishan's tendency to not take shit like that sitting down, we're going to find out in the near future whether the "cancer" statement is true or false.  




 Between this and his public outburst against that shit-talking ex-employee (that was him, wasn't it?) he seems to be an extremely unprofessional individual.

The weird thing about Reddit is that it allows former employees to air their grievances out and corporate has no way of confirming or denying the accusations. Imagine what would have happened if Yishan never responded and just decided to let that simmer. Intimidate public opinion would shift because a Reddit employee says he was fired indiscriminately. 

Yishan basically kicked it in the balls instead of becoming one of those lightening rods for Reddit to seethe at. And then the process repeated itself during the Ellen Pao era, except corporate handled it properly by not putting itself in the area of divulging the nature of someone's employment history. 

All this means is Yishan is clear now to pop some corn around Reddit's offices.  




 Granted that I have no idea what the terms of this guy's termination were, but I can't imagine they didn't include nondisparagement and nondisclosure provisions. And now, in the litany of things that people who are anti-Pao like to rattle off at the merest mention of her, "fired a guy for having cancer" and "pry this position from my cold, dead hands" are regular features.

Think of the position Yishan puts Reddit corporate in now that he said this and KickMe said there's dirt on people and Yishan is going all "fuck it" on Reddit and Twitter.

Reddit is basically one of those justice scales right now and Yishan just tipped it in favor of the transparency set that make Reddit's most vocal members. If Reddit attempts to go after Yishan for just poking around the bush, they're gonna piss off that user base, who'll go fucking nuts and they already got through pissing them off just a few weeks ago.  




 They fired their last PR handler.  




 Ellen Pao and Yishan are friends. Now that they're both out, the gloves are gonna come off. I wonder how this is going to get reported in the press? Ooooooo...this is getting gooooood.  




 Yishanzai! 




 Yishan is the Kernel of Popcorn. And the best part was he ran the company so he's got good shit to air out. It's not like he's entirely wrong, but damn this dude just loves to talk about inside company stuff.

Oh, what a day. What a lovely day! 




 Looks kinda boring.  














 This movie will end up being about The Wolverine again somehow.  




 I would like to see one of these talks with both the directors of Narco Cultura and Cartel Land talking to each other. They both bring up similar issues and I think it probably would lead to a fascinating discussion.  




 Very, very interesting talk. It's interesting to hear the dichotomy between the two subjects of the film. I wonder why with the amount of defense spending that none of it finds its way to the border? This seems like a massive oversight.

I imagine cartels are smart enough not to cause violence on American soil. They probably realize that if they did that would basically mean the beginning of the end of that kind of access to the border.

 I've read Michael Gibney's [Sous Chef](http://www.amazon.com/Sous-Chef-24-Hours-Line/dp/0804177899) which tells a similar story. I gather Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is in the same vein, but essentially what I gather is that you get 3 hours to prepare for lunch, one hour for break and dinner prep and the rest of the night being behind on orders. Did you ever work in a kitchen with the ambition to become a head chef? From my experience reading these books they're either treated like war narratives or ones where people had the ambition to become head chefs and own their own restaurants. 

Have you thought of starting a sub reddit with the ability to tell all those stories? I'm having a hard time wondering why you mod the subs you mod, bothering with the metaverse and other unsavory subs to put it lightly, and yet you still refer to the guys you worked with as a second family. 




 How did you recognize Reynoldo Rey from 227? I don't think he would even recognize himself from 227 if he was alive. I know you have a history on Reddit but I kind of want to hear more about these kitchen stories. Most interesting customer? Weirdest things that happened in the kitchen?

Also, favorite things to prepare? You said you like cooking and fishing so I'm guessing you like preparing fish on occasion? 




 Do you have any stories to share about cooking? Favorite thing to cook? Worst dish prepared? Worst customer served? You worked in the cooking industry presumably so what's life like on the other side from your perspective? 




 Okay, fine, if you won't answer that question then I won't get into a prolonged battle.

Do you have hobbies?

What are your top 10 favorite books? 

Do you at least recognize that some of the stuff you say is problematic? 




 We ask that you embrace Reddit's diverse culture rather than cleansing it. We get our touchy-feelies on Facebook. We come to Reddit to be reminded that life can be harsh. We come to Reddit to see hot girls taking off their clothes for nothing more than karma. We come to Reddit to learn, even if what we learn is offensive and ugly.

Would you like to flesh out what this quote actually means? This seems like an awfully myopic view of the function of Reddit.

 If you can't attack the proof, then attack character. Exactly what I'd expect. This is a sub for intelligent discussion, you don't want it fine, go somewhere else. 

The original claims were: 

1.  Only comments criticizing her incompetence and/or equating her to fascist leaders. 

2.  There are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations. 

I provided proof of both, twice. Unless you can refute the claim I really don't need to entertain the bunch of childish baby responses I woke up to saying "cunt isn't really sexist, we we just posting we wanted to punch this cunt in the face but it was in the appropriate subreddit! That has nothing to do with gender." Fucking hell, I have one right below you resorting to bromides and un-sourced bullshit.  









  Stop being pedantic. 

Would you prefer I don't treat your comment with the respect you expect it to be given and just say "hurr durr pedatic, ur wrong?" I can't pick out the "spirit of your comment" when it's wrong because the comment that started this conversation was over the fact that someone was denying that any activity whatsoever of sexism occurred let alone made it up to the front page.

For instance, out of all the signatures that signed the Ellen Pao petition the [numbers on the words "Cunt" and "Bitch"](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3cfpoa/word_cloud_of_reddits_ellen_pao_petition_oc/) out pace regular prepositions. And this is out of all participants who commented on the petition. Unfortunately, I don't think they're calling her a "cunt" because they know her personally and therefore can attest to the validity of any of these statements. If you want more fun selections from Reddit's grand petition [enjoy the video from the guy who did the data-mining on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8IIey7vydM)

In comparison to reddit's 160 million unique monthly visitors, they are a minority. A vocal minority, to be sure, but they represent around 0.1% of the reddit userbase, assuming that every one of those subs is an active, unique user (and they aren't all active and unique).

160 million users of which the [overwhelming majority is male](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-gender/465979). And which an overwhelming majority of that majority managed to launch a large organized temper tantrum resulting in a CEO stepping down making their "DAE Pao is literally Hitler" campaign seem legitimate. Did [Yishan end up getting this treatment when he banned The Fappening?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuxtaposition/comments/3c1bn6/ellen_pao/) (NSFW). [Did this occur when Yishan instituted policies at Reddit that banned Jailbait?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate51/comments/39on4t/ellen_paos_cunt_very_nsfw/) (Also NSFW). 


But if you want more proof you really just need to compare the statements of Steve Huffman who essentially rephrased the same policies of Ellen Pao and the responses from the same audience who actively went out of their way to downvote her responses into the thousands. Ultimately, this is a conversation about the pernicious nature of these communities that eventually turn their giant crybaby campaigns into organized efforts to take over the community center. The question becomes do you want these guys (the people who don't contribute or enjoy becoming apart of communities) to be able to take over the community center by rushing from their dank basement and taking a baseball bat to good communities, which seems to happen with regularity now, or does Reddit take the stance that allows free association to also include the ability of free exclusionary measures to weed out those pernicious actors?  They can't have it both ways. 

Not many calls for Huffman as being literally Hitler when he said he wouldn't bring FPH back or that he wanted Reddit to be a safe place for all sorts of communities. Then again this is a different conversation. 

 




 Hugh Jackman looked real burned up about not having a seat. 




 Probably because Sam Raimi pretty much can't top the terror of the first one so he jumped ship and made a three stooges comedy film. It's a remake and yet it's basically a whole new take on a film. 

However, I think that Evil Dead remake is on par with the original. Aaron Motion should be a bigger name in the field of cinematography, but his work on that film is brilliant.  




 I don't know. It's hard to pull off a massive science fiction fantasy and those aren't really a dime a dozen with the kind of production values that The Fifth Element has. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I think it's damn near close for me to perfect. 




 The Big Lebowski. I've watched it like 3 times and I never understood why people find it so knock down drag out hilarious.  




 Best scene was when they blew up the cat. Other than that, it's a pretty okay vigilante movie that borrows heavily from Michael Bay looking camera work. 




 "No one tells me there are no blue berry Popsicles."  




 Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn never wasted their one fuck.  




 Was this filmed from the perspective of someones dick? 




 Nothing will beat that compilation. This was alright, kids stammer like they're eating apple sauce, which is funny, but that other one was just a long cut of people realizing what they got themselves into is terrible. 




 game recognize game 




 You should see her Twitter account. She tweeted out an uplifting news link about Redditors attending a kids birthday party and some skellington got 1000 retweets by telling her to resign. Who the fuck wants the job of CEO? 




 I hope Memepool says "Thanks Mr. Skelatal but I don't feel like eating Jolly Ranchers I have broken arms, FUCKING KEVIN. I want to be air force."

10/10 writing.  




 It's what happens when you get your political education from re-watching The Dark Knight Rises 150 times.  




 /r/upliftingnews is about being reminded that your life is terrible. 




 We ask that you embrace Reddit's diverse culture rather than cleansing it. We get our touchy-feelies on Facebook. We come to Reddit to be reminded that life can be harsh. We come to Reddit to see hot girls taking off their clothes for nothing more than karma. We come to Reddit to learn, even if what we learn is offensive and ugly.

Is he bringing the naked girls who will dance for karma? I need to go to the karma bank to get a bunch of one upvotes.

Sweet fucking jesus. This letter is the equivalent of a highway truck stop strip joint. I can't believe someone wrote this. 




 Pls Zack. Let me have your man baby. you are visionsary. beautiful visionary. 









 SRD got hit with the accusation that we collectively dogpiled the Dylan Storm comment in Pao's resignation announcement to -700. This must be a new achievement.  




 its a fucking internet site. get over yourself.

A rare moment of self-awareness in a sub devoted to a giant temper tantrum.  




 Shit, it's gonna lead to so many "MODS ARE CENSORING ME" that mods would probably just shut down the sub.  




 The creators I'm talking about literally run all the defaults and the thousands of other medium and small sized subreddits. None of these people are employees of Reddit and they had the power to shut down the subs that account for a lions share of its traffic and Reddit couldn't do jack shit without pissing off even more users. It's insane how much power Reddit corporate has given over the main subs that drive traffic. 

The entire point of Reddit is that you can create the subreddit you want, curate the community you want to have, with no restrictions.  Unfortunately, users seem to believe this entitles them to undermine creators intent by saying that they want the ability to freely post anything if it means posting it, having it removed by a moderator, but still having it be there. You've just removed the ability for moderators to do their job of curating a subreddit, which is exactly what they do thanklessly for free while going about the other obligations of their daily life. 

If moderators at /r/askhistorians want to curate a subreddit that aims to be like a historical journal why would you remove their ability to do that by taking their power away to deal with comments and users that undermine the sub? If I'm an editor of a sub that aims to the editorial standards of The New Yorker, then I don't want a bunch of one line posts about "DAE broken arms jolly racher chris nolgan?" clogging up my pages. But if you want to make a sub that allows that, the Reddit gives you the ability to do so. The issue here is users not realizing the power of editorial decision making is only a click of the button away. Outside of that it becomes a discussion about getting eyes on shit that the moderators didn't want in their subreddit and users complaining about censorship because they weren't able to hijack an audience for what usually are bunk causes.

And I'm overthinking it because these are the issues that will arise. Thinking about it makes sure a policy doesn't go into effect that will drive people away from the site before they make a mistake in implementing it.  




 The part that I enjoyed about his AMA was that he essentially said that they have 50 million to burn through which he thinks means that he has no real expectation to deliver on monetizing those investments. It's gonna get real sticky when they run low on cash and those investors start getting antsy. 




 Because you're taking away the power of moderators and creators of subreddit to create the subreddit they wanted. People seem to misunderstand that Reddit is a place for creators, by creators and made with the purpose that you would curate the experience you want to create. 

If you take that power out of the moderators hands then you're basically asking for all sorts of things that you didn't want. The moderators of these quality subreddits have no obligation to stay and tolerate it. 

You already have moderators here clamping down on shitposts. Can you imagine placing new rules that would ensure higher quality posts and then having the company who tells you to do whatever you want and create the subreddit experience you want that you now have lost that power?  




 The next CEO is just going to be a guy in Costa Rica with no publicly listed address and nameless issuing out draconian orders.  




 I mean all the criticisms that have been leveled against it have already been talked about about. Pretty much taking out the Poison Snake lady and the plot about the Silver Samurai and just making it a "Wolverine Vs the Yakuza" story would have shot that movie right to one of the best comic book films.  




 You won't concede even when I do provide sources, because you're part of this hate movement.

Besides, you already lost the debate a couple of messages ago via a fallacy.

We're done here.

I guess he doesn't have any???? 




 Hundreds of games, books, plays, movies, and events got censored or cancelled or disrupted by SJWs.

wut?????? 




 And I feel like Scorsese wouldn't even include his all important "voice of a pufferfish from Shark Tale" that is essentially to completists.  




  I don't think anyone is saying that there hasn't been any sexism or racism directed at Ms. Pao. 

The original commenter said both that he had seen no posts in the postive numbers that were racist and that "there are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations."

These are both patently wrong statements which negates yours saying there hasn't been anyone denying that Redditors really shit the bed on this one. And one only has to look at the response when Yishan stepped down as CEO. He was the one behind the banning of both Jailbait and The Fappening and yet my front page was not flooded with babies calling the CEO a cunt, "a gook" and "this fucking bitch."

The complaints against Reddit are valid, but not when you have these type of people attempting to hijack a conversation about the fact that Reddit didn't really give a shit about interacting and communicating with the community that keeps its doors open. And these aren't minority numbers. These are thousands of people as the screenshots show. FPH had 150,000 subs, KiA has 40,000, SRC has around 10,000 and all these people keep giving the community a shit name. Meanwhile, cunt wasn't something thrown around when Yishan did the exact same measures against subreddits like Ellen Pao did. 

 




 How many heads do you have? I need to know to adequately prepare my information for the heads that watched it and the heads that didn't. 




 I meant it would ruin your day to have to go through all the hoops of legal action, as justified as they would be.

"Why can't I just grope all the women I want, man? Your trying to arrest me, you know, ruins the rest of my day."

I hope none of these people become lawyers. They're gonna put a lot of their clients in jail.  




 I imagine they would have more hilarious shots of Dennis Leary looking like someone showed him a squirrel nutsack. 




 I enjoy your backpedaling.

"There's no evidence of sexism or racism"

"Oh, well, cunt is really a term of endearment."

"Oh, well, calling someone a gook isn't racist."

I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like when presented with evidence you just want people to keep giving it to you until it's a mountain full of it. Then when there's none left to give you'll go, "SEE! I told you. No sexism or racism."

But I suppose "Ching Chong Ding Dong" and "This Cunt" were just affable ribbing. 




 Neither is KiA. Heyoooo. 




 I read their opinion section from time to time, they have a lot of inane bullshit on there like an opinion piece on peas in guacamole. 




 I don't know whether to laugh or cry that it wasn't pointed out immediately in the next comment with a pejorative like "you believe this shit?" or "this fucking sub."  




 Breitbart: The only news source where reporters are allowed on Twitter to call former CEO's "Vexatious" and still be considered detached from the story they're reporting on.  




 This is the same plot as Spy, but with bro spies and shit. 




 BUT I THOUGHT EVERYONE WENT TO VOAT? OH NEVERMIND I DOESN'T WORK ANYWAYS HAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA 




 Someone really needs to explain how Aisha Tyler became the designated MC of nerd ceremonies at every big convention. Also, Zack Snyder ain't no public speaker.  




 It's probably a more auspicious event for Tarantino, who will hand the power of dictating musical emotion to Ennio Morrecone, than it is for Morricone to score it.

Morrecone is basically the Eric Roberts of film scoring. He does like seven or eight movies a year, a large work load for his age, if you pay him. He does a ton of weird direct to DVD projects.  




 Why don't they just release an HD trailer?  




 I don't think anyone on /r/movies has seen anything other than comic book movies, Christopher Nolan movies, and an assorted bag of 14 other titles associated with mind fucker filmmakers.  




 It's dehumanising because it breaks people down into races. And I have the nagging suspicion that even if they had had Asians at the forefront of the casting, there'd be complaints that none of them were gay or transsexual or something else.

We're all white on the internet.  









 Oh shit. Batman is in two movies.  




 The Rumpled Shithole

Dick Dickerson and The Castle of the Grotesque. 

The Corn Gorge 

The Meaty Sack

A Repetitious Fingering.  




 
i don't think enough people have seen it because it was a fucking terrible movie, but Identity Thief was pretty much one long mean spirited fat joke after another.  




  And lastly yup, people were right when they were saying thats Robins costume in the backround of the first trailer, and the jokers killed him :(

I hope Jenna Malone is playing the next Robin then.  




 It's weird how uncanny Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder's aesthetic is to each other.  




 Why does he need a coat? 




  I believe that story line is a middle finger to those who hate man of steel simply for the destruction.

Or it's addressing a story point that even David Goyer seemed to scoff at. Whatever he planned in his original script it didn't seem like that was one of them.  




 And thus the age of DC begins.

It will be a glorious fanboy war.  




 There's something hilarious about watching Henry Cavil walk into congress with that suit shot with all the sincerity of a serial killer movie.  




 Who as time to read articles when you have time to pretend your in an online high school movie with stratified cliques? 




 Mah fathur was a gamur. mah granpappy was a gamur and ur gunna be a gahmur sun. 




 For these people it seems, high school never ended. Some just got a bit more "professional" and pretentious with their bullying

High School. High School never changes.  




 Save your money. For the love of everything that is good.  




 The social justice warriors on twitter are not happy this is being made...

who cares?  









 Probably because all those nostalgic nerds raised on MST3000 and Redlettermedia all think they're Buddy Hackett and then start talking during movies. Then there are the teens. Fuck teens. 




 But they're **"nice guys**" 




 All media lies. All media is corrupt. No one believes even traditional print like the New York Times. Gamergate will not be able to fix games journalism or journalism as a whole. But what it can do is open the eyes of those who care about the truth and continue to be a watchdog of the corrupt.

I'LL BELIEVE ANY REDDIT COMMENT BEFORE I BELIEVE FIRST HAND REPORTING.

 "Mom, no, look I'm healthy. You want proof? Let me show you this thing called Reddit. This is what it looks like when people shit the bed."

 I wonder what it's like to be DavidReiss666 and have people actively attempting to come after him because he won't let them post 8 hour documentaries about holocaust denials? 




 okay. u got da job? when can you start eating hot dog pizzas?

 DJ Khaled is the Mark Twain of our time. true satire.  




 If there's any justice in this world Adam Sandler would announce Grown Ups 3 on the same release date as Pacific Rim 2. 




 We need a fucking Jaeger airplane. 




 Basically this is going to be the best TV series ever and Starz just found itself a viewer. They better not skimp on all the cool as creature effects.  




 SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome. 




 SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public.
