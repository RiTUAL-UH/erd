 I don't have IB, Ghorn, or even Atheons Epilogue.  




 IM A CHILD AND IM ONLY ALLOWED TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES ON WEEKENDS SO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY! 




 What console? 




 Thats not that bad, I expected it to be more. I guess I'll try to save up for the $35 one to save a few bucks for the next one. (And I have askednicely 




 Well this sucks, my parents refuse to get me it for Christmas as video games are a waste of time, and I'm a kid with no money :( could you tell me how much the DLC is so I can start trying to convince my grandpa I need money for school supplies? 




 Do you have to buy the DLC to get to light lvl 32? Do you have to buy the DLC to get the new raid and weapons? I don't think I will be able to buy the DLC, but I still want the full Destiny experience. 




 I'm a middle school "Kindergaurdian" and all the people I play with say I don't squeak so I refuse to take offense to this like I do all the other posts complaining about young guardians.  




 That only *hands* could satisfy 




 Destinylfg people have always wanted to cheese the Templar for me. I don't even know HOW to kill the Templar legitly.  




 Yes. I have good friends who now play on xbox one while I'm still on 360. They were kind enough to hop on 360, do that 1 gig update, spend 20 minutes finding other level 30's and ran me through the hard raid. I got Timebreaker, The Truth, and the chest and gauntlets. All I need is the helmet now :) 




 First time running hard mode raid, I got the Timebreaker, the Truth, the raid chest, and raid gauntlets.  




 "I hear they're almost ready"

 I know, I cringed myself through it. And I laughed so hard at the end when he said " umm, rapping isn't normally my style, but I hope you enjoyed!" 




 Okay I thought after you heard the song it would be very clear that I was being *extremely sarcastic*

 Haha I put this up as a joke, I saw this video and I really had to push myself to actually watch it. I wanted to know if everyone else thought the same. 









 Thank you! 




 Hahaha that was perfect! 




 Like if you stumble across a hilarious spelling error that makes the sentence completely different? 




 Wow thank you so much! 




 Awesome! I only need four, so I that means I can upgrade twice if I get as many as you do! 




 Are there any good imgur apps that you know of? I type in imgur in the App Store and like 20,000 imgur apps pop up! 




 I'm mostly a mobile user, but is it possible to post a link from my camera roll? Or do I have to upload my picture on imgur to get a link so I can post to reddit? 




 Cool, I have an extra legendary plate I don't need, hopefully I'll get a few out of that. 




 thats awesome! I'll ask a few friends. Thanks. 




 thanks!  




 I'm a lvl 24 and to rank up my chestplate defense I need 6 ascendant shards. I already have two, but I have no idea how I got them. What's the fastest way to get ascendant shards?
 




 Hahahaha my friend told me this forever ago! 




 i got this achievement by doing a the Heroic Weekly strike. You don't need to do the VoG to get the achievement.

Wait, nevermind! Wrong achievement! I was thinking of Flawless Striker. 




 Diarrhea because migraines just suck. 




 Have you read Enders Game series? (Im assuming you have, based on your username) how do you like it? 




 Im in middle school (junior high) What is post secondary? Elementary school? 




 that doesn't sound like fun. I'm a few paragraphs done, but it was mostly my partner doing it. I look up the articles, she puts my quotes into words.  




 Once upon a time, there was a dad and a mom and a bunch of kids. One day, the mom and all of the kids get murdered except for one child. The dad raised the child as normal, but one day the kid disappeared when he went off on his own to check out something. The dad then devoted his life to finding his kid, even if it meant traveling across the ocean. He had the help of a mentally ill silly woman. Together, they find his son Nemo and they are happily reunited.  




 No, I can't think of anything that could connect the two, except its in your head. 




 In English we were doing a 9/11  unit and we have to explain the reactions and stuff on how tragedy affects community and do an analysis and stuff. 

 




 Meh. I have other things on my mind then whether or not I like beards. I guess they're okay. 




 I really don't feel like writing said essay, so if you could ask me some questions to take my mind off the fact that I should not be on reddit right now. 




 Definitely has to be Photograph. From the second I heard it I knew I would love it. I was on the verge of tears with how beautiful it was. 




 Whether it involves a hose or swimming in the ocean, I want to hear it! 




 Im on right now my gamertag is Jade Sueta. 




 Still looking? Ill add you 




 Ansel Elgort *don't judge me* 




 Is there a subreddit for *everything on this site?* 




 *GASP* how did you discover my secret!? 




 Wow believe it or not I had no idea that subreddit existed! 




 That would be awesome. 




 Um... Sorry??? 









 Haha but either way I have no answer. I don't really listen to eminem often. 




 Well maybe in a few million years the world will shift and it won't be so lonely anymore.  




 Its an island in the middle of an ocean.... 




 I feel like this is a trick question and I'm supposed to answer " ew I hate eminem he's not a REAL rapper like (insert weird rapper name here)" 




 More like upper middle class. My parents want to move to Hawaii, so we have to save money and shit, but then they go and buy my bro an iPad mini when I can't have a bag of chips at the store! And woah, now we pay 130 a month so me and him can go to Tae Kwon Do! ( not complaining, I love TKD) 




 Sonic the hedgehog, talking tom, and this guy who looks like a rapper with a foreign language as subtitles. And those are just a few of the thumbnails. 




 Well on YouTube he always types in "asdfghjkl"  




 The world will never know. 




 Ama 




 The music was bad, and it wasn't so much a stunt montage as much as it was a "jumping off the same 4 things for six minutes" montage, but hey, you can only improve from here! :) 




 Well survival is partly fun, part cash. Me and my friends will grind sandy shores surivival for like an hour an a half, and 20 thousand isn't that bad for each one. I think if you are with people you enjoy and doing a survival, it's like a podcast or commentary or something. It just gives you something to make some money while chatting or talkingabout something with your friends. If you are just going in with random people sitting there in silence while playing, you're gonna have a bad time. ( and 20k on ammo! Do you only play with sticky bombs or something? 




 Thanks! I'll add you when I get on tomorrow. 




 Why........?
