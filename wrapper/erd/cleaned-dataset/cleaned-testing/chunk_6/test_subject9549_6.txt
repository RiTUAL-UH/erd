 I just started reading the first book and I'm already halfway through it... Can't wait to finish so I know what you're talking about!!! Ah!

Update: I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK. HOLY SHIT. 




 Is that a "That wasn't a fart!" expression?

Congratulations. She's absolutely beautiful! 




 True, but she got into a lifeboat for a second time (the one Cal and Jack put her on) and got off of that one too! If she would've stayed on that second lifeboat, maybe Jack would've had a chance.  




 Yay!! We got ours in the mail today. We are leaving May 9th, and I'll be turning 23 while we are there :) 




 I'm not a professor, but I had the same professor for 5 classes and I know something that always drives him mad. This professor teaches creative writing courses, and every week people turn in rough drafts of their work for the class and professor to critique. Far too often someone says things along the lines of "I finished this right before class" or "I completely forgot my work was due until the last minute, luckily I was able to whip something together." They say these things to fellow classmates and most importantly to the professor. Oh man my professor abhors it. He is extremely passionate about his classes and about writing. Whenever students say stuff like that he takes it as they didn't care about their writing or the class, and it makes him feel like they are wasting his time. I mean, it takes hours to critique the works for each week (for my novel writing class each manuscript was like 20+ pages long) so I totally understand why he is so upset when students act like they didn't care about it, and so blatantly admit that they don't care.  




 Yay! Congrats! 




 Just keep checking! I've heard that people double book and then cancel one of the reservations when they make a final decision.  People will probably cancel as the date gets closer. After obsessively checking for weeks, I managed to pick up a BOG dinner reservation for May 11 about a week or so ago.  




 For some reason, I'm thinking Liam. I really wish Sammi would die though.  




 We have "Better Call Paul!" billboards here in Northern Kentucky. I've been meaning to get a pic of one for weeks.  




 I cannot wait to prank my husband with this in May.  




 Yay!!!! I'm glad it's not completely impossible to get a reservation lol.  




 Hi all!

My husband and I are going to be in Magic Kingdom on May 11 to celebrate my birthday. We didn't get to experience BoG on our honeymoon, so we're going to this time around. When we booked our vacation, all that was left were lunch reservations, so I got in at 1:15pm. However, I wanted to see if I could get in for dinner because I kind of want my birthday dinner to be sit down and not quick service. I've been stalking the reservation site, but for weeks I've been getting the "Sorry, no reservations are available blah blah blah" message. Imagine my surprised today when TWO reservations appeared! One at 4:05 and one at 8:55. I nabbed the 4:05 time. Now I can't decide if I want to keep the lunch or dinner reservation (we don't we to do both at BoG in one day because that's way too pricey; our second meal will be a quick service, most likely Pecos Bill)

I've been weighing the pros and cons of each. I really like the idea of lunch being cheaper, but I like the dinner options a bit more and I really want to try to meet the Beast. I cannot decide, so I've decide to ask the experts. Those who have experienced BoG, which do you like better - lunch or dinner?  




 Just the white Red Heart Super Saver - nothing fancy since I was just practicing. 




 I am still relatively new to crocheting, but I decided to try my hand at a dress last week (I told my husband we can't start trying for a baby until I am a pro at making baby clothes haha). I found a relatively simple pattern that uses just double crochets and shells (2dc ch 2 2dc in same stitch). [Here is the link to the pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/angel-wings-pinafore) on ravelry. Also, [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e9/61/5c/e9615ca1910a65cfe58bbe0055b227f7.jpg) is a super cute dress that someone on Pinterest made using the same pattern. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/FyuhyTu.jpg) is my final version - I didn't try to gauge it or anything since I was just seeing if I could following the pattern (I'm still learning how to read patterns, but it came out alright. I used Red Heart. 




 I really hope it's not Morgan, and I've been trying to find reasons to believe it isn't. In an interview Robert Kirkman said it would be a huge misstep on their part if Morgan didn't meet up with the group at some point (though he refuses to confirm if he ever does). Also, last December, Scott Gimple said, "People want to follow that character; I want to follow that character. There's a Morgan story to tell. It's the beginning of something, but I'm not going to say what it is, or how involved it is." There hasn't been much of a story for Morgan's character so far, so hopefully they didn't just screw with fans and just killed him off.  




 They did it! They did the thing with the window!! Ahhhhhh!!!! 




 I hate to admit that you are be right and there may be new deaths... However, didn't they dig graves for Lori, T-Dog, and Carol (who they thought was dead) at the prison even though there weren't any remains to bury? If so, then that means two of those graves could still be for Noah and Aiden despite not having their bodies.
