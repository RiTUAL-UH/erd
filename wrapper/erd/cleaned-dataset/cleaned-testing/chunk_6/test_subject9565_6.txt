 So there is a song called I want to get better by the Bleachers-Jack Antonoff side band he's also in the band fun. It's a song that I can relate too 




 My favourite performance of hers is probably Veronica Mars. Second is House of Lies. Her character is the only reason why I watch the show.   




 So why is it that you always play characters that always get in the way of the shows main love interest. For example you play Noel in Felicity who was in the way of Felicity and Ben and now in Scandal with Olivia and Fitz.  




 Glad to hear!!  




 Talk to your doctor. If you have been feeling this way for a while it could be. I have been feeling really down and I knew I wasn't my usual self since November then a few weeks after in Nov my sister told me she was engaged I didn't feel anything and thats when I knew I needed to speak to someone.  




 Tell someone about what you went through 




 In all honesty when I think about the future me, I can't picture myself getting old. Keep your head up high kid you're only 18, you can do it 




 I have depression, the illness makes me feel empty, I used to enjoy skiing and other activities but I have lost interest in some activities that I used to love doing and everything just feels grey to me. The illness makes me feel alone because not many 21 have depression thats why I hid it with a smile. I don't know if I answered the 3rd q right but it made me open up more about my depression an what i've been feeling inside.  




 We all wish we were something else. I wish I didn't have depression, but I can't do anything about that prevent it from happening because it already did. My point is, I don't know what you're going through fully but I have two good friends that are gay males and whenever someone saids ''Ugh thats so gay'' I want to slap the person because there is NOTHING wrong with being gay. The internet can be a cruel place for anyone. Unfornately, there isn't much you can do to decrease the negative comments but there is a great quote from 50/50 the movie "You can't change your situation, the only thing you can change is how you deal with it''. There always going to be people that have to bring people down, but you just have to tune them out. As long as you are happy that all it matters. Who really cares what a stranger thinks, because the last time I checked their opinion is irrelevant.  




 The characters, the storyline, the directing (won't be a good movie if the camera is very shaky etc) and most of all the script. If the script is shit most likely it will be a shit movie  




 He needs help, there is nothing wrong with that, but people are afraid of being looked differently or don't think they need help. It's really up to the individual themselves. It took me a few months to finally get help from social worker and the doctor. The move is not easy, trust me but once I did it I feel a lot better and I'm more open about my depression now. Ask him maybe how's he feeling or how are you. I mean this is a tricky question because everyone is different. I would definetly try to push him into talking to a social worker but that's definelty not a easy thing to do. Good luck!   




 I think about this on a constant basis. Everyone thinks about their funeral, but if you think about this often and when your alone it could be because you're  depressed. Don't worry you are not alone. I think and picture my death right in front my eyes. I picture people's reactions on Facebook and who would show up at my funeral and what would they say. You are definitely not alone. Find something that you can distract yourself the second you have those thoughts. For me, once they appear I try to shrug them off.  




 I agree, laughing helps. No one would think I have depression because I'm always laughing but that is what helps me distract myself. Yes it only for a few seconds but those few seconds help

 She should speak to a professional. Is there something that you and her share? Like old memories that you shared together in the past you should bring it back. Maybe you and her did something in the past that you guys stopped doing like going to a certain resturant or a certain area and maybe bring it back?  




 Watching Movies/TV is a good hobby. I find it a great way to distract me from my problems and stress. There are a bunch of good movies/tv shows that are out there. If you need any suggestions let me know  




 What gets me out of bed which sometimes takes me while like an hour. But every week I have one thing to get me through the week. Could be something simple or something special that you don't do much. For me, I love movies/tv is really the only thing that keeps me going. I have a few shows to look forward to for each week. Have something like maybe a bubble bath or something that you don't always do or something special that will get you up and also look forward for the week.

 Last year there was two movies with the exact same plot but different names/characters about the White House in danger. It always happens 




 Sounds like a good plan  




 To be honest I probably would.  




 They don't need to make them period  




 Iron Man 2 was the weakest and most disappointing out of the 3 movies. I would of given Iron man a 60% because Ironman 3 was so much better than the second one. Ironman 3 has a 78% while Ironman 2 has a 73% so there is only a 5% difference between the two films. I would bring Iron man 2 down because it wasn't great. I think Iron Man 3 should be higher up.  




 So what I loved about Frozen is it was different from the previous movies. There was no prince charming and no princess live happily ever after with a minus bump on the way. It was about two sisters which was nice to see. I think the music made the movie even better because the songs are so well written and so catchy. It's a no brainer that Frozen won 2 oscars for best animated and best song.  




 I like superhero movies, but I hate how Fantastic Four is getting a reboot. The movie isn't that old, its unnecessary reboot.  




 Thank you I appreciate it  




 I know it may sound crazy, but I think about how my family will react to my death and how people will react on Facebook and how people will be crying at my funeral being all shocked because no one would expect me to be depressed because im always ''happy'' all the time. I picture my funeral and I'm not even 21 yet.

 I started to be a big fan of his work when Sliver Linings Playbook came out. I liked his other film the Fighter as well. American Hustle was an okay film, a lot of hype unfortunately the movie did not live up to it  




 This will be terrible 




 All the time 




 The best and my favourite-Sliver Linings Playbook  




 rotten tomatoes 




 I told my doctor. This only happened once, I was really scared. She moved me up to 1 and half which I think is 15mg.  




 i liked how the movie told Olives point of view plus there was a lot of funny moments in the movie that i loved and after watching the movie  i wanted to see it again

 So it's going to be three weeks this week I believe that I've been taking cipralex to help with my anxiety and depression. My doctor told me it takes about three weeks for the meds to work. Today my suicidal tendencys/thoughts have increased to the point where I was tempted to put my hands on my neck which I did but I stopped myself then I saw a cord and I visualized the wire wrapped around my neck. I know it sounds really crazy, but is it normal for meds to increase the thoughts because I was told after 3 weeks I would notice a change
