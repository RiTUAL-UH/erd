 You boyfriend needs to understand that sexting is pretty normal nowadays. Unless you're Amish of course. 

Also, just because you send pictures to someone doesn't mean that you're 'asking for it' which I feel like is basically what he was saying. 

I think the issue of you forgiving yourself has to do with your first sexual experience.  I don't know if this has occurred to you but you were raped. 

You didn't want it, you said so out loud, but he did it anyway. Just because you didn't physically try to stop him and just because he was your boyfriend doesn't negate the fact that someone had sex with you against your will. 

I think you need to seek out counseling to deal with that trauma and I think you need to explain to your boyfriend that you need his support in this.  




 By all means, text him.

I guarantee there is cell service in Vegas so no communication from him is not acceptable. Let him know that you are unhappy with him for the silence and he should at least be checking in with you at the bare minimum once per day. 

When he returns you can have a longer conversation with him about what the trip was like and find a way to move past any uncomfortableness you have with things. 

For now, try not to yell or scold him, just let him know you expect to hear from him.  




 Yes absolutely take his offer. 

It would be one thing if she was just someone he dated or hooked up with while you guys were broken up but given her history and the fact that she's still trying to sleep with him even after he made it clear he's not into that (since he's back with you) she has to go.

Honestly if I were him I would cut her out anyway regardless of what you said. She is dangerous to your relationship and disrespectful towards you as well. 

As for dealing with the jealousy you're just going to have to talk to him. Ask him to be honest with you about what happened between them and ask all the questions you need answers to. And going forward tell him you need to know anytime she tries to contact him, even if it seems innocent at the time. 

And if he's comfortable with it, ask for open access to his phone. Just know that if he says no to that request it shouldn't be a deal breaker.  You are both still allowed privacy. 

Do your best not to obsess over it. You guys are back together and he's serious about it. Just look at what he told her when she contacted him.  Trust him, it seems like he's doing the right thing.  




 Start making plans just for you. 

Tell him 'Tomorrow morning I am doing 'this' if you want to come let me know'

In your head, plan on going alone to do whatever it is. 

You've indicated that you're ok with small changes so if he decides to go then that should be fine. But at least this way you have a plan and you follow through. 

Additionally you should tell him why you're changing your SOP. Let him know that his avoidance of committing (either yes or no) is draining and you aren't going to be relying on him for that anymore.  




 Your parents were fucked up when you were growing up and did a horrible job parenting you. 

That is not your fault. 

It's good for your sister's sake that they've improved but I guarantee that their improvement had nothing to do with her. Just like their complete lack of responsibility had nothing to do with you. 

Their actions are not any value judgement on you or your worth. 

It's natural to feel the way you do I think. You've been traumatized and you're having to deal with it. 

For your boyfriend I would suggest finding some good reading materials on supporting people with depression. A quick google search of that phrase finds a few good articles and there's probably some more in depth literature available. 

For you, just make it clear to him that the way you're feeling isn't because of him. He is not causing your depression. He also can't fix it. What he can do is be there for you (ways for him to do that are why he needs to read up on the subject). 

As others have said, you need to seek out counseling. I know it's difficult. Hopefully the idea of insurance through your school pans out because you need some help to deal with what you're going through. 

I know there are a lot of people here who are willing to talk (like me) but I feel safe saying that most of us are not trained professionals.  




 You lied to him for a period of time and that was fucked up. 

But the only thing you owe to him for that is an apology and the truth which you've already given. 

You don't owe him a relationship, you don't owe him surgery. 

If he really wanted to be your friend or have a relationship with you he would try and forgive you and move on. Instead he's holding it over your head by saying you 'owe' him something. 

You need to cut ties with him. He is a selfish person and not interested at all in what is best for you.  




 I wish I had something super helpful to say but I think a lot of it has been covered already (therapy). 

I can say that you and your wife don't need to worry about your son's potty training. 

I have 2 daughters and my first daughter potty trained in about a week (minus overnights) at 2 years old. My younger daughter didn't finish until she was 4. It's totally an individual thing and also has to do with how uncomfortable they are sitting in soiled clothes. 

My younger daughter has no issue sitting and continuing play in her wet pants so it took awhile to get things to stick.  




 What's killing me is that what I'm going through doesn't feel normal.

My wife doesn't give a shit about me anymore, she's not going through one of the toughest times in her life, she's already moved on. 

And the fact that she can drop me this easily makes me feel absolutely worthless and doesn't really inspire any kind of confidence for my future. 

I know even if I could meet someone right away that jumping into another relationship is a bad idea I just wish I had some hope that I could find one sometime in the future.  




 You say you have a successful career so tell her you're seeking therapy to better deal with job related stress. 

I don't know any job that doesn't involve stress and generally the more successful one is, the more stress there is to deal with. 

I understand you not wanting to hurt your wife and if you feel like you can't be honest then joint therapy probably isn't the best idea now. 

I will say that you need to find a way to communicate how you're feeling to your wife. That's something you could work on with a therapist though, I'm sure.  




 I forgot to mention, I'm in therapy and I am currently taking medication. 

At best right now I feel ok. Not great, just ok. 

The past few days I've just felt worse and worse.  




 My wife came to me at the beginning of January saying she wanted a divorce (married 9 years, together for 11).  I wanted to try and work things out but she was not at all interested.  She was convinced that we would never work out and didn't want to 'waste her time' working on a relationship that was destined to fail.

I was already in a depressed state and this did not help things along.  I ended up checking myself into a hospital for most of February.

During that time she did basically everything she could to abandon me.  She never visited, didn't bring our kids to see me, she only called me once.

I found out after I was discharged that she started a relationship with a coworker while I was hospitalized.

Now we barely communicate even though nothing has been finalized.  We are working out a custody agreement but it's not finished and we haven't even discussed dividing assets other than cars.

She's totally moved on with her other guy and I feel more and more lonely every day.

I'm sure that dating someone else right now would be a bad idea anyway but I'm feeling pretty hopeless about my future prospects.

I've never been great at meeting people in general and women in particular and between work and being with my kids I don't know when I'd have time to anyway.  I'm not an incredibly social person.

Plus, I feel like I am a really bad dating prospect.  I'm 33, soon to be divorced, I have 2 kids, suffer from depression, I'm employed at least but by no means am I wealthy, I'm probably about average in the looks department.

I just keep looking into the future and seeing me alone and it's really hard to keep positive about anything right now.

I'm cross posting this to r/Divorce because I don't know how much of this is normal end-of-marriage feelings and how much is my depression talking.

 What you need to do first is figure out where you want your relationship with your wife to go. 

Do you love her? Do you want to stay with her? 

I think loves takes many forms. Maybe you love her most for how she facilitates things for you, that's not inherently wrong. As long as you are fulfilling her needs then your relationship can work. If you want it to. 

If you decide you want to stay with her then therapy is a good idea, for both of you. Tell her that you're happy with things but there's always room for improvement. Talk to her about your goals and her goals. Figure out how to best fulfill her needs. Communicate!

If you don't want to stay with her you need to tell her, and soon after you decide. 

BUT, don't use the attention you're getting or the relationship you have with this other woman influence your decision. Sit down and decide solely on the relationship you have with your wife.  




 Well, without hearing from her we can't be sure of her motivations. 

I choose to believe that during their breakup she realized that she would rather be with him and chose to come back. 

I think if she was really treating him as a 'back up' then there would have been more stringing him along going on. As it stands, when they broke up, they also broke contact. 

Maybe I'm wrong though, maybe the other guy she was dating dumped her and that's why she came back. 

Either way it happened though she still didn't deserve to be cheated on. 

Edit: Also, I can't fault her for breaking up with him when she did. She obviously knew things were headed towards engagement and decided to end things before that happened. If she wasn't sure of the relationship and her commitment to it that was the right thing to do.

It's going to suck either way but I'd rather that happen to me than to actually make a proposal and be shut down. Or, have her say yes because she feels pressured in the moment and not really mean it.  




 You're a giant jerk. Whether you wanted to break up or go on that break doesn't matter. You guys weren't together and she dated someone else. That's life man. 

She eventually realized that you were what she wanted and came back to you. That's awesome. 

And then you go and cheat on her as part of some ill conceived payback?  

If you were still really bothered by her dating someone else while you guys were broken up then you should have sought out couples counseling before now. 

I guarantee that you sleeping with someone else would never be a therapy that someone would suggest. 

Honestly it would be best for her if you guys just went your separate ways, she deserves better than this. 

If she's determined to stay with you then you guys MUST seek out counseling. But your number one priority should be coming to the realization that what you did is wrong and fucked up. 

You need to apologize and do everything she needs for her to feel better about things.
