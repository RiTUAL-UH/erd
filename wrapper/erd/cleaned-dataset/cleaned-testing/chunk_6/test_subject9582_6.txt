 Copious amounts of top shelf cannabis. 




 I love to tongue punch a fart box, especially my wife's.
 




 Hello Aziz, who was the funniest cast member on *This is the End?* 




 Great job catching up! 




 Everything was cool, liquor, bud, cheeseburgers, then these two bitches started texting the same guy. He showed up at the party, then he was coaching one of the crazy whores on how to beat the other one's ass.

It's a shame, but it's survival of the fitness boys.


 




 Too much.
 




 I like to play the meow game. 









 A while back.. you mean five days ago. 




 That's it! 




 I know. I talked about this on FB for the past week, and I live in Cincinnati. Rain, gloom, and fog. Expecting a storm here in the next 30 minutes. 




 I suppose only Ringo knows. 




 Are you yanking my wand, or do you have some evidence? 




 ..and that the look-alike had tons of plastic surgery.
 




 I have seen many videos that say Paul is dead, and the remaining three called him "Fauxl" because they wanted to keep the machine going.
 









 the Gryffindor fireplace was connected (in case of an emergency or something) but disabled, and that Sirius (who spent a lot of time learning Hogwarts' secrets) knew how to override the security measures.

That is genius. 




 The doctor, after an examination, sighed and said, Ive got some bad news. You have cancer, and youd best put your affairs in order.
The woman was shocked, but managed to compose herself and walk into the waiting room where her daughter had been waiting.
Well, daughter, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things dont go so well. In this case, things arent well. I have cancer. So, lets head to the club and have a martini.
After 3 or 4 martinis, the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more martinis. They were eventually approached by some of the womans old friends, who were curious as to what the two were celebrating.
The woman told her friends they were drinking to her impending end, Ive been diagnosed with AIDS. The friends were aghast, gave the woman their condolences and beat a hasty retreat.
After the friends left, the womans daughter leaned over and whispered, Momma, I thought you said you were dying of cancer, and you just told your friends you were dying of AIDS! Why did you do that??
Because I dont want any of those bitches sleeping with your father after Im gone. 




 Well Dumbledore would have been pushing 40 by then, maybe he'll make an appearance? 




 In Bruges has Brendan Gleeson(Moody), Ralph Fiennes(Voldemort), and the girl that played Fleur, forgive me, I have forgotten her name. 




 I can smoke a pound in a single bound. 




 35 year old male who only showers weekly in the corner of his mom's basement, and he will never shut up about the fucking button or goddamned home-made lube. 




 Sewing through the top layer of my skin. 




 That we are all a part of the same living world, and that there is a life force that is everywhere. Just my theory, but do you ever notice how angry and hostile you feel in the city, but when you walk in a forest you haven't a care in the world? 




 Car wreck. My brain was injured.
 




 We would wash our hands a lot more.
 




 This pipe of some top quality cannabis that I'm about to spark up when my kids leave in a few. 




 Does dead count? I was dead for about 90 seconds. 




 I think you're barking. 




 I agree. The dementors just shut him down from the first time he encountered one. 




 Do you have beer? 




 Wow, they won and lost 5 in the matter of minutes...
 




 How about you just don't drink yourself into a stupor? That sounds like a plan to me. 




 My bad. 




 LOL! OPA, I really like you. We should be friends.
 




 This *post* is worthy of applause, well said. 




 Very close. 




 3.4 of some sweet sweet Jack. 









 How awesome would it have been if Albus sent Snape to fetch Harry?

"Hello Petunia, long time. I need to take the boy to school."

I mean, she knew who Snape was, it would have been a better choice instead of Vernon driving all over England trying to avoid some letters. 




 How awesome would it be to send Severus? Hello Pet...  tunia. I am here to take Lily's son to Hog..  warts. 




 It would be like trying to divide by zero. The entire world would implode, and the we would be temporarily floating in the atmosphere until we lost all oxygen. It would be hell on earth.

Seriously though, what if your biggest fear is your biggest fear?

The thing of it is, we just don't know. 




 The top point of the triangle should be pointing up the arm, not downward towards the hand. 









 Image is fine, the tattoo is upside down.
 




 Why is it upside-down?
 




 I'll be there the first week of August, and I'm excited to see Diagon alley! 




 I would also add that phoenixes are *extremely* rare, even in the wizarding world. Mythical or not, they're real in the Potterverse, and I doubt that anyone, even Dumbledore could become a phoenix animagus. 




 One day a redhead, a brunette, and a blonde were on their way to heaven.
God told them the stairs to heaven were 1,000 steps and on every step he was going to tell them a joke. If they laughed they would not be able to get to heaven.
So the redhead made it to the 45th step and laughed.
The brunette made it to the 200th step and laughed.
But the blonde made it to the 999th step and laughed even before god told his joke.
God asked "Why did you laugh I haven't even told the joke yet"
The blonde said "Hahaha I just got the first one!!!" 




 I think Albus was around 117 when he died. 




 I'll be there the first week of August, but I have never been alone. 









 What, it's a good one.

It's also set about thirty minutes up the road from me. 




 Ha, I was in the county inn, in a camp bunk bed situation. I thought everyone was asleep. 

Long story short, next morning, about 12 guys around me all knew, and all they said was, "Well, did you get your nut?" 




 I have three daughters, and I would do the same. Hell, I would probably take pleasure in it. 




 Tibetan Freedon Show, 1997, Randall's Island, NYC. 




 Red River Gorge in Kentucky. 




 Just happened in Texas not too long ago. A guy found a farm hand raping his daughter. He beat the guy to death, and was not charged. I believe that was the right outcome. 




 Gummo 




 Beg your pardon. 




 They are wearing a Nickelback tee shirt. 




 I was struck by lightning about four years ago, that was pretty traumatizing. 




 This is what I was trying to say, yes, I just couldn't find it. 




 I don't think so, because that happened in Little Hangleton.
 




 Oh, I don't think so. He killed Bertha in Albania beoforehe came back to England with Pettigrew. 




 It was Bertha Jorkins. We don't know if Wormtail killed her or not. I don't see how Voldemort could have. 




 Harry isn't a true horcrux. Harry is an *OOPSIE* that Tom Riddle was not aware of. 




 That's what I do. not to save them, but I'll pause and do other shit for about a half hour, then you can FF through the commercials.
 




 I know. The average half hour show is a 22 minute, three act play. Whether it be sit com or cartoon.  




 I have them all, but ABC Family adds in the deleted scenes. 




 Four minutes of movie, six minutes of commercials... 




 Yes, I have around 100 Kenner figures starting with the original 7. 




 Riddle's soul split after Lily refused to step aside and let him kill Harry. When Lily didn't step aside and let him kill Harry, that's what caused the rebounding AK curse, causing a piece of his soul to latch on to the only other living thing in the house (who knows where the damn cat was). Harry was the carrier of Tom's soul that he never intended to make. It was purely accidental, but he properly created the other six, giving him an eight piece soul. 




 Beg your pardon Miss Head, but creating a horcrux takes an enchantment that Voldemort did not do when he attempted to kill Harry. 




 Yea, that is really creepy. I made another post about that. He was at least 18 in season 1. 




 Bitch! You know what I want! 




 The sarcasm is thick with this one. 




 That's funny. 




 I don't like to go in the heat.
 




 I have some obscure pieces, but I don't know what they're worth.

Edit: anyone interested? 




 This album was released in 1993, and it was a bit of an anthem to my life as a young buck. Thing is, it still holds strong, every, single, time, I, listen, to, it.

Edit: Thanks for the gold! 




 Down to 70% now, but it's been 90-95% the past week. 




 I got Molly, I needed a Bruiser.  









 thank you! 




 I have been called that, but what's it to you man?
 




 I apologize, is there a different sub for this? 









 What?
 




 Thanks 




 When I meet someone new, and I get asked that question, I just smile because I am the epitome of stoner. 

I'm 38, long hair, goatee, graphic tees, crazy shorts, and sandals. 




 That's what I meant, sorry. I have 98 command points.

Is Union Jack a good one? 




 Yea, I've been thinking about Groot. I hate fighting him. 




 I can buy the alts, 98 A points, but I would rather build my stack of heroes.

Speaking of, who should I invest in?
 




 [Sorry](http://i.imgur.com/saodfPV.png) 




 No shit, Sherlock.

 Hang on. 




 Neither of those, but elektra does very well in the bleed dept. and can kill when the opponent is below 30%. 




 You could always pick your favorite [chapter art.](http://i.imgur.com/IJQ13E5.jpg) 




 Don't have Black Knight, but when I don't use Taskmaster I use a 14 Elektra. 




 I've been playing this month with a 14 Sabertooth and a 13 Taskmaster. 














 There were plenty of POTUS' that were from Jewish decent, starting with Lincoln, but I think Bernie is the first full blooded. 




 I think the American people are ready for a serious change, and not that Obama bullshit. Bernie is opening a lot of eyes across the country. 

You speak of a woman president, who was the last Jewish president? Nixon?

Edit: Clinton, and then Eisenhower before him 




 I would put my money on Bernie Sanders. 




 Making home made lube. 




 ..and there was a twinkle there that I would say Gambon lacked. Plus Michael is just too damn short. Albus was supposed to be over two meters/six foot. 




  Harris had a very gentle and quiet voice, and I always thought that was perfect

Yes, this. When I read, I read Albus in Richard's voice. 




 You are barking.

"Alas, earwax." 




 Is that all it is? I thought it was like a full on cigarette filter. I just smoke from my pipe, maybe I need to clean it. 




 Do filters take away the buzz? I smoke nothing but the best, and I've been worried about my lungs lately. I see everyone rolling with a filter tip. Should I? 




 That's my point, it won't have the pheromones and or hormones.  









 What are you smokin'?
 




 I hope he's playing *Walk.*
