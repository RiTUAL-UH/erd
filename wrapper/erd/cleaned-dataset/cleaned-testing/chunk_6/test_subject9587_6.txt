 Minor pet peeve of mine:  "enemy" is a term of war, or battle, whereas "friend" refers to a social relationship.  This phrase is more powerful (and conveys the sentiment better) if altered slightly:

"The enemy of my enemy is my *ally*."

Not being a dick, just putting the idea out there; do what you like!

Fuck the Raiders. 




 /r/theydidthemath  




 Chris Harris III incoming? 




 In the post-game presser Fox said that Rahim was just very fired up, yelling, "That's why you drafted me!"  Fox said that it was all very positive, just lots of emotion after a big play.

Recall that Rahim almost lost his leg last year, and could have died. 




 Not the 10 hr version.  Downvote!

(Not really!  Good on ya.  Go Avs) 




 I approve this message.  




 If it makes you feel any better, this is how I approached every game in the late 2000's against you assholes.  I just knew LT or Sproles would score 5 touchdowns or something.  And they always did. 




 Agree.  Let's never say salty again.   Every movement starts with a single idea! 

 




 Totally right.  Football in the new era is getting to the dance,  then playing your best 3-4 games there.  If we play like the SF, SD, or IND games in the playoffs, we have a good chance.   If we play the SEA or NYJ games, not so much.  It is true for every other team in the league, too.  But I think that the Broncos have a greater margin for error than almost every other team, and that feels good (for example, both the D and O can carry us if one falters).

GG.  Fuck the Raiders.  




 Are you sure?  Are there any Cardinals players who have an opinion? 




 Ugh.  No kidding. 




 Oh yeah, that's the good stuff! 




 They clearly have a QB package.  Heard Romo and Elway. 




 Nobody forgets monkey riding a dog. 




 Ha-*ha!* 




 **Hate** bullshit calls like that taking away great plays.  Boo. 




 False.  NE and KC and SD away are rough.  Cincinnati too.   




 Nobody knows anything until Phil Simms explains it. 




 Juwana-Man trucking. 




 Yeah.  #54.  Here's a helpful guide as his twitter pic: [ pic] (https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/514594308352385027/l_2ixyDj.jpeg) 




 Groovy.  Thanks. 




 You are cool. 




 Not a Chargers historian - which of your # are retired, and I am guessing his will be once he gets the HOF? 




 Chargers fans:  LT celebration okay?

Homage or being a dick? 




 Umm.  Thanks,  Carey.  Awkward as fuck here. 




 Ro-mo.  Ro-mo. 




 Nah, watch this horsemeat commercial. 




 Still might . . . And give a first down to the Chargers from the flag.  This could be more supreme stupid from Malik. 




 I think this may have been the initial pitch. 




 Own.  That. Shit.  It is *your* sandwich,  too. 




 "Okay, guys, we have reached our allotted amount of rapes and beatings.  Tone it down." 




 Are you sure? 




 Everyone watches *Two Broke Girls*, *The Big Bang Theory*, *Two and a Half Men*, *Elementary*, and millions of CSI/NCIS iterations.  Everybody. 




 You are correct. 




 Most folk in these parts think he will play out his full 5 yr contract (so, two more years after this one).  Seems possible if the injury bug stays away.  He isn't exactly getting worse. 




 On purpose, tighter is safer. 




 Yeah, but *he'd* know. 




 I'd answer, but I am technically at risk for alcoholism,  so . . .  




 Other Manning and Romo? 




 Saving them for the second half, I bet. 




 Clearly ran 5 yards. 




 Solid 2 min drill here.  Looks like we will get points w/o giving Rivers a shot.

Obv no turnover etc 




 Carter *also* bit on the short route.  Who cares if he catches it 10 yards short? 




 Yeah, me too.   




 No way Q.Carter belongs on Gates. I get the plan, coaches, but he has failed.  Move on to something else, jeez. 




 No arguments here, but in a game thread? 




 Von Miller is our dreams. 




 He posted a bunch of testimonials regarding the sexual assault allegations.  Like LOTS of them. 




 I approve this message.  *The Catch* is legendary. 

It'd be like comparing any 98 yard drive to *The Drive*. 




 I think it is the Donahue (sp?) Interview. 

If not that, the black and white one with Mike Wallace. 




 Lost to the Ravens -- Acknowledge. 

Beat Chargers and Patriots -- Ignore.

Lose to Seahawks -- Acknowledge. 


ETC ETC.

DITCH this shit. 




 Until very recently, this was the Broncos' *m.o.* as well - collapses from frontrunner to missing the playoffs basically got Shanahan fired and destroyed any chance McDaniels had to continue as our coach. 




 Yeah, I can't wait (but I am going to, because there's lots more football to be excited about!) 




 I think it is because ARI still plays SF once (and beat them earlier!) and SEA twice.  So, those games have a much greater effect on the implications than does this one.  Even if PHI wins, ARI is still in 1st place with an inside track, and conversely, if ARI wins, they can still shit the bed in their division games. 




 I mean that you have more security with Bitcoin because your identity is not automatically attached to your transactions.  I agree that there is greater responsibility to take care of your keys, devices,  etc with Bitcoin, but the benefits lay in divorcing your personal information from your purchasing power, and I think that is worth the increase in personal responsibility.  




 Totally agree.  My go-to "elevator" explanation is this:

1.  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency which is traded through a *network*.  (People understand "peer-to-peer" from Napster, and most have a reasonable concept of a "network").

2.  Just like banks/companies/families have a ledger/transaction balance/checkbook - so does the Bitcoin network.  But, it is public, and everyone in the network has a copy.  (Likewise, people understand a "ledger" - making the jump from a pen-and-paper ledger to a digital, decentralized on is certainly a leap, but you can help facilitate that leap by introducing that concept early)

3.  Mention the "headline" benefits (no 3rd party, personal security, etc.)  (Get 'em excited!)

**Then**, if they are interested, we can talk about the blockchain, mining, SHA256, etc, etc.  But don't load people up with that up front - they'll get scared. 




 Yeah, that is a major early misconception (one which I had, as well).  And you can tell that the gentleman was thinking along those very lines when he asked, "And that's for *one* Bitcoin?" 




 This was a very valiant effort for morning news/talk TV.  Important points were made, there was some fogginess on the details (I don't think she really understands where bitcoins come from or what they *are*), but overall this was way better than I had anticipated.

If segments like these cause just 1 in 100 people to give bitcoin a serious investigation, then they deserve praise. 




 Good job, ungulate bro!

*hoof bump*
 




 Wait, I was watching that game, what was so egregious? 

ninja edit:  The offensive P.I.? 




 This is a legitimate complaint.  Honest assessment of your record / division standing after those 6 games you mention (i.e., before finishing up the division slate)? 




 But it was to the Rams/Seahawks game - where you got to watch the Fail Mary beneficiaries get Special Teamsed to death. 









 Still beat the Steelers.  You're probably gonna be the game that keeps them out of the playoffs.
 




 I read that as "Food Loin" every single time.

You know, like a loin of food? 




 JJ Watt is a just a shared hallucination of the entire human race. 




 Through the first seven weeks, I think we are getting a much better picture of how this season is going to play out.  And let me tell you a secret: it is going to be **AWESOME**.

We are looking at absolute dogfights in the AFC West, AFC North, NFC East, NFC North, and NFC West, with at least four legitimately strong Wild Card teams in each conference.  Do not be surprised if a 10-6 team whiffs again this year (like last year's Cards).

And then, the playoffs will get going.  Since opening up the year slowly, the Colts, Broncos, Ravens, Patriots, and Chargers look *really* strong.  Add in a dark horse like the Bengals (who have fallen off of late) and the Chiefs or Texans and you've got some great playoff football brewing.

And the NFC won't disappoint either!  Cowboys and Eagles still have 2 games against each other, but are otherwise X-1.  Packers and Lions are X-2, and have looked unstoppable at times.  The West is going to be absurd unless Seattle falls off the map, as the top 3 teams still have 5 games between them (Arizona has the lone win, so far).  The possible playoff matchups here are also very intriguing.

tl;dr - As we approach the midway point, this year's playoff push looks to be thoroughly entertaining - and the playoffs themselves will be even better. 




 Actual line from that movie (when Will and Shawn (Sean?  w/e) are parting ways, and hugging:

 Will:  Does this violate the doctor/patient relationship?
 
 Sean:  Only if you grab my ass.

A fine joke, reasonable, not even too dirty with only one possible bad word.

The TV "censored" version:

 Will:  Does this violate the doctor/patient relationship?
 
 Sean:  Only if you turn around.

Isn't buttsex dirtier than ass-grabbing?  TV is weird. 




 PFM said they installed the fake screen to DT -- Welker Go route on Friday, too.

DO YOU SEE WHAT YOUR THURSDAY GAMES ROB US OF, GOODELL?  DO YOU SEE!?!?!? 




 0/ 




 We scrong, then. 




 Oh man, it is Chargers week!  Time to pull out the Cryin' Ryan youtubes! 




 Did you cringe when the announcer on Sat. night said, "When I look at him [Winston], I just keep seeing Big Ben!"

Because my wife and I did. 




 Check out [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nfl-week-6-elo-ratings-and-playoff-odds/), they do a weekly "Playoff Odds" calculation and often mention the possibility of a team going winless.  I have linked to week 6, where the Raiders were predicted to go winless in 11% of the simulations - the Jaguars, the other winless team at the time, went winless in 7% of the simulations.  

So, to answer your question, I would guess that the number is slightly higher than 11% - so probably better than 1-in-9. 




 Stupid Thursday games. If you'll recall, this happened last year to us (Welker had his concussion the Sunday before and obviously couldn't play on Thursday). 




 Also /r/dataisbeautiful would eat this up. 




 First he was stream - of - consciousness dreaming about Andrew Luck getting traded to the Broncos in 2030 and beating Peyton ' s record.  Then Collinsworth said they'd be at home for it.  And Al said they be *in* the home, and then said maybe in the casket.

No verbatim 




 Jokingly referred to his own demise on national tv.  

Bad juju. 




 Al Michaels ' daydreams are awesome. 




  Quick!!! Camera on Peyton! 




 Ha!  Go Cardinals! 




 Raiders could be the last winless team.

Oh, wait . . .  




 Relevant:  Luck has played one more game.

Your point stands.  Talk to a Texans fan about Colts and QBs. 




 Very possible.  One NFCE team will be good, one NFCN team, too.  2nd and 3rd in the West have to compete with them.  Will be dicey.

For WC, obv. 




 How many times are they going to let the right tackle move early? 




 Eagles are a reasonable answer, but I would give it to Dallas. 




 And of the 6 games between those 3, only 1 has been played so far (Cards beat 9ers).  Then, we learned the Rams can show up, too.  That division race is going to be awesome to watch. 




 Change hands! !!! 




 And we spotted 'em one incompletion. 




 Me too. 




 Yeah, he really does. 




 Possible but very unlikely.  Him sitting out his first 3-4 years, plus injury last year make it a longshot. 




 Broncos won toss and deferred. 




 The bad CB blitz on 3rd and 17 was a more likely culprit. Boo. 




 Pot Roast with the record.

Calling it. 




 Hahaha.  Harbaugh is awful.  Even if he wins this challenge (50/50), he just moves the Broncos back 15-20 yards.   Still 1st down and 10 to go.  Is your time out worth that little?  What will Kaepernick do the next time he can't snap the ball in time? 




 WR in high school. 




 John Fox ' s Review Coach has the responsibility to call down to him there. 




 Which animal? 




 Easy call, his arm with the ball hits the pylon. 




 Kick never had a chance. 




 Happy with how this game is playing out.  Just like last week, a division foe is going to lose in heartbreaking fashion. 




 Sick Gaines, bro. 




 I think that was a poor challenge anyway.  Chargers still go on 4th there. 




 A. Sherman is best Sherman.
