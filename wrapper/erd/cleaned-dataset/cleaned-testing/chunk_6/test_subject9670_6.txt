 I created this, I set it up, I posted a ton to it... ....and then, for no reason, it was banned.

like the message says, it may've been done automatically but... I can assure you, it *wasn't* spam.  

I'd like to get it *un*banned and back up   running again.

thanks! 









  the days of green lawns and pickets fences are over.

why are they over?  it just rained a ton where I live, and though there've been the regular dry periods that most of the country has experienced, water's never been something lacking in my area and nor really is land 




























































































































































































































































































 seems hypocritical.   I guess this means that he's ordered his guards to stop carrying guns and start carrying ... candycanes?  














































































































































































 Don't get me wrong, I have *no* doubt that things are going to continue to advance... and continue to advance to technologies that are capable of all sorts of things we can't even imagine yet....

....but, I still think the 'singularity' concept is more like an 'it all blends together because it's over the horizon and we just can't yet see what it's going to be or how it's all going to fit together'  than a 'this is going to be so dense we'll never figure it out'

 














 I personally think the singularity is overstated, overhyped, and essentially just a marketing buzzword.

I think things will continue to get ever-more complex... and that the average person will become ever-more confused by them... ...and even the *smartest* people will have difficulties discerning elements... ....but, never underestimate the human mind's ability to 'sum things up'.   to 'lump things together', to 'pattern recognize' and, as such, categorize things, process things, or otherwise sum things up such as to dismiss them.


in short: 'the singularity' is a marketing pr buzzword.  it's hype.  it's the 'over the horizon' phrase that the present uses to 'lump things' it can't yet see.   when we get there, it'll be much clearer 




 maybe it's zooming out?  carbon required to harvest, transport, process, etc?  Consume the carbs and we fart their carbon back out? 

in such that the carbon equal to (and more likely greater than) that that's initially sequestered is released over the course of... a year? 




 definitely easier for 'em to get to....  




  AI means self awareness, consciousness and not a better calculator

have something to back that up?

I believe you may be over-complicating the definition of AI

for example, Merriam-Webster defines AI as: : an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence

: the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior


wikipedia, obviously the standard-setter on everything and never wrong, 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also the name of the academic field of study which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behavior. Major AI researchers and textbooks define this field as "the study and design of intelligent agents",[1] in which an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.[2] John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955,[3] defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".


Wired covered this about 15 years ago... can't remember if it was Kurzweil, quote, interview, or written by... I know he was definitely mentioned in it.   but, it created a differentiation between artificial intelligence and artificial spirituality. ...whereby the intelligence had become so complex that the system was otherwise 'contemplating things' on a spiritual level.

That said, AI has been around for quite some time... and it doesn't necessarily imply 'consciousness' ... at least not in the more traditional perception of the word... as defined by Google

 consciousness
kn(t)SHsns/
noun
the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings.
"she failed to regain consciousness and died two days later"
the awareness or perception of something by a person.
plural noun: consciousnesses
"her acute consciousness of Mike's presence"
the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.
"consciousness emerges from the operations of the brain"


*My* understanding of it... as it was explained somewhere along my readings.. is that its been around for quite some time.   and that it's basically a system's ability to make independent decisions based on information w/out human involvement in those decisions.

obviously this would fit the 'aware of one's surroundings' aspect of the google definition above... whereby, say, a satellite with a sensor array designed to detected space debris .... ... as well a laser designed to 'zap' the debris to blow it up or otherwise put it into a decaying orbit.    instead of a human deciding for each   every ISS nut   bolt floating around... the satellite uses its sensors to detect analyze, categorize, and otherwise identify the space debris... ...and, then, uses its programming to 'zap' it w/out human intervention, assuming it matches preprogrammed perimeters. 

but, the 'decision' is still preprogrammed... within pre-established perimeters. It is an 'intelligent' decision, but not necessarily one that requires 'consciousness' to do... ...though, it could be argued that the satellite has self awareness due to its ability to detect things around it... but in truth, it's just functioning within perimeters.     AC or AS even would take that to an entirely different level... each about as complex over the previous as AC over AI.  ...at least in my opinion.

AI itself isn't really all that fascinating, systems utilizing it are built   used all the time... AC? I'm not quite sure we've reached systems capable of that ...yet.  and, even if/when we do, it will still, technically, be functioning within preprogrammed perimeters.  At the same time, machines write their own code all the time... most code is machine-written coding at this point ... has been for probably about a decade.  but, again, difference between AI, AC, and AS.

I'm not saying we can't get there, I'm not saying people won't program systems to be as convincing as possible (of their consciousness   spirituality) ... they already are, the tech news covers this all the time... ... hell, i'm not even saying it won't actually be conscious, spiritual, and have a 'soul'... much more simplistic machines seem to have 'souls' or 'essences' of sort... just talk to a farmer about his tractor or a grease monkey about his '68 mustang in his garage... but, imo, I believe that people will have a difficulty of sort accepting AC or AS ... or even AI in its more simplistic understanding... without an organic component to the system.   ...which, well, can easily be involved.  we're building neurons all the time, and we've had neurons that interact with silicon systems for well over a decade... so to build a hybridized system... ...where most of the processing happens on the 'binary-side' of things is *totally* possible... again, I believe we've already done it.. many times...  ...and, even go so far that all the *primary* and '*critical*' processings... ...the ones that the user interacts with that creates the 'convincing consciousness' side of things to the lay person interacting with.... but, again, w/out typing the two together... or, with a removal of the organic, I still imagine people will see it as being, essentially, a machine.
