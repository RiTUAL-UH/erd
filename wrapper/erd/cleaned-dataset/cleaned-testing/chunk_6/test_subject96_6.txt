 What do you mean "employment agreement"?

Employers must pay you for all the time you work. If you're working, you have to get paid for it.  There's no employment agreement that can supersede that. 




 Eh, your former employer sounds like a jerk. It's a campus job, so it's supposed to be a learning experience as well as employment. 

Giving you the boot without giving you a heads up about your issues and giving you a chance to improve or change would be bad enough in a regular job. For a student job on campus, that's just beyond the pale. 




 If you don't care about keeping your job, why not just report it on up the line. I'm sure the upper management would like to know that you're keeping sensitive customer data on an unsecured, external HD for months after the work is done. 

And hey, maybe the problem actually gets fixed. Worst case, your boss cans you and you collect unemployment.  



















 Yes, but he still manages to become a super-ninja and sex all kinds of hot women.

The books are a fun read, but Kvoth is a Mary Sue to end all Mary Sues. 














 Personalized pavers that once lined Clark and Addison streets near Wrigley Field, home of Chicago Cubs, have been found around Pontiac, purportedly coming from the nearby landfill. The bricks had been billed as permanent fixtures by the Cubs organization when they began selling them in 2006.

The Chicago Cubs began selling the pavers near the holiday season in 2006, inviting fans to purchase brick pavers on which they could engrave personalized messages, up to a maximum of three lines and 15 characters per line. Prices varied, but were typically around $160. 









 Mediocre! 


































 In my defense, I copied it from the original article. 




 Greetings, Starfighter. You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan armada.  


































 I would like to buy a ticket right now, please and thank you. 









 Life is a spoiler 









 Let's have a press junket to try and generate a little positive PR and then throw a few reporters in prison when they write about stuff we don't want them to write about. Makes perfect sense,. 




 Didn't feel like much of anything, really. Nice to see Stan and Peggy finally get together. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of Don meditating and then the cut to the Coke ad. Maybe I'm dense, but it didn't mean anything to me. 

 




 I watched the trailer and it actually made me laugh, which is a rare thing for a sitcom trailer.

I'll definitely give this a few episodes when it hits the tube. 









 Matthew Perry's  "Mr. Sunshine" had an opening theme song which was "Mister Sunshine..yeah" and then on to the show. 




 It's all in the game, yo. 














 Ozymandias was based on Thunderbolt and Silk Spectre was Nightshade.

It's important to remember that Moore changed these characters quite a bit when writing Watchmen. Nite Owl and Rorschach are maybe the closest to their Charlton equivalents. Silk Spectre is almost nothing like Nightshade and in fact her outfit is based partially on another 40's heroine, Phantom Lady. 









 Mad Max is hampered by its R rating and maybe a bunch of people who would like to see it spent their money on Avengers last week.

I expect it's going to have long legs, though. It's a great great film and it's going to benefit from buzz and word of mouth.  




 Yes, Adalind said that the anti-Hexenbiest smoothie was only a temporary solution to the Juliette problem. I expect her powers will come roaring back at a plot-convenient time.  




 Yes, I was thinking that bad ass Juliette would be the heavy hitter on the team going forward, but it looks like Claire Coffee is going to be the Grimm Team Hexenbiest instead.

Can't fault the decision since Coffee is the better actress and much prettier to boot.  














 Katheryn Winnick  
























 Yes they did. They finally realized that they loved each other, all the previous seasons to the contrary not withstanding. 

I really liked that show and the final episodes were just terrible. 




 I agree. I hate that you can't have a man and a woman be friends/partners without it turning into a romantic sub-plot.

I really really hated the ending of Warehouse 13 for that very reason. 




 That green guy...what's his name? 









 TIA? 














 It's [nutpicking](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nutpicking). Find some whack job on the other side and compose a breathless, blog entry excoriating their whackjobiness. 

Makes for good clickbait, but it doesn't mean much. 




 I'm offended by that question.  




 Never get out of the car. Never ever get out of the car in a situation like that.

My driver's ed teacher told me a story of a student of his who loved to fight. Big guy. Strong. Loved to scrap.

So one day he gets rear ended and he gets out of the car, fists up, ready to mix it up.

The other guy just shoots him.

A couple years back I was driving to work after dropping off my daughter and some asshole in a landscaping truck is behind me and honking every time I stop at a stop sign. Like he doesn't understand the concept. 

It's a nice day and I have the window down, so after a couple of these I make a comment or two out the window about his lack of understanding of traffic rules. At the next stop he stops his truck,and gets out. I can see him walking towards me in the side view mirror.

For about a half second I contemplated getting out of the car and teaching this asshole a lesson. Then I'm thinking that I'm a grown man with a family and a mortgage, the last thing I want is to bleed out in the street because someone honked at me at a stop sign. 

So I waited for him to get close, then I put my foot down and drove away. 




 Very few countries have that many large venues suitable for a World Cup match. Most soccer stadiums in these countries are for local teams. They can't seat 50,000+ fans with concessions, parking, etc.

Plus, building new stuff helps FIFA get their grift. 




 I love sports, but more often than not it seems the whole reason to own a team is to squeeze money out of the public coffers and justify shady real estate deals. 









 I'm pretty sure that FIFA is the only international organization more corrupt than the IOC. 
























 Yeah, I don't know. I have no problem believing Kim is an evil bastard, but I don't quite buy that he's a Bond villain.  




 But you can buy a 2kw generator for one tenth the price of the battery.  From an economic perspective, it makes no sense at all. 









 Make no mistake, this kind of internet vigilantism is only going to get worse as years go by. 

Look at some kid the wrong way or sit on the train with your legs spread too wide or make a dumb joke to your seatmate at a conference and some righteous defender of all that's right is going to whip out their bat phone and make sure your supposed transgression is spread to the furthest corner of the world.

Welcome to the fishbowl.  




 The video looks best when the characters are pretty much static and the camera is doing the moving. Then it's very stylish and evocative.  When the characters move too much, they look jerky and video-gamey and it's not as effective.


 









 I prefer [this pic](https://scontent-lga.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/10852759_785821501508004_1931213515_n.jpg) 









 Yes, the 65+ cohort are working more than they used to, but they still work a lot less than the 16-64 group. They're also increasing as a percentage of the population, so overall it's a drag on the total Labor Force Participation rate. 




 I'm sorry, but you've made one of the classic blunders. Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.

Oops, sorry. I mean the fairly common mistake of confusing rate with number and how rates of smaller groups change the rates of larger ones.

Now, it's certainly true that the labor force participation rate (LFP) for those 65 and older has been increasing. You can see an increase of a few percent over the last ten years. It's now about 19%. But LFP for the 25 to 64 cohort is 77%, obviously much higher.

The issue isn't that the 65+ cohort is working less than they used to. As your data shows, they're working more. But they still work a lot less than younger Americans and since they're increasing as a percentage of the total population, 12.4% to 13% based on census data, the overall LFP rate goes down. 









 Nicely done, although the song is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.

I accidentally played the S2 teaser trailer at work and as soon as the sound came out of the speakers my co-worker spun around and was like, "Holy crap. What's that?" 




 Sure, but the long-term decline in the the labor participation rate [is mostly structural](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/declining-labor-participation-rates/).  The US population is aging and the Boomers are retiring. A lot of people checked out of the economy early due to the Great Recession and they're not coming back. 




 Yes, you should watch them...because they are awesome. 




 Sure they do. There are [six different official unemployment calculations](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm), each calculating the number based on different factors.

The one we normally consider to be the official unemployment rate, the one that gets quoted in the media, is U3.
