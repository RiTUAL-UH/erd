 Because there might be new viewers who have no idea what it's called? 














 My only gripe with the main event was that shoddy producing with bad camera angles  




 Makes sense. He doesn't seem to have that new driver vibe to him 




 Since WWE is hard on protecting their product now, most of the new talents are given a new, copyrighted name that they can't use elsewhere. 

But there are leftover from the old era, John Cena, Randy Orton and Mark Henry were lucky to debut when trademark is not really important, or in Mark Henry's case, his name, like Kurt Angle, carried it's own weight

So /SC, which talent was the last one was allowed by the WWE to use his or her own name? 




 Depends. Jann is an exceptional talent that also adapts to the physical side of racing like duck to water. Not many people, especially people that are used to sit on their couch could commit to.

For example Gregger Huttu, who is regarded to be the fastest driver in virtual racing, was totally drained physically when he test a real racing car at Skip Barber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_sCrM1CcI

It helps that Jann's is a footballer, and that he might have trained with his dad. But a normal person who has no physical training prior? he might have a harder time 




 I know, IIRC it was more than that the last time. But I was just pointing out Suzie got the drive because of Toto's influence as a shareholder, not because Williams is a customer team for Merc. 

Her first test with Williams was when Williams are still using Renault. 




 Son Goku 









 He was McLaren's test driver during his DTM years, so it's not like he has no single seater experience 




 Actually Toto has a stake in Williams

Torger Christian "Toto" Wolff[1] (born January 12, 1972 in Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian investor and racing driver who is currently a 30% Owner and Executive Director of Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team and *a shareholder in Williams F1 of which he owns just under 5% in shares.*
 




 Corey Graves is doing this with Becky Lynch on NXT. One of my favourite thing because he hates her for no reason  




 the banking means that you would need minimal steering when you use the karousel and if you time it just right, it will spit you out in a straight path. 

I always use that during online races where new drivers would use the upper non banking section and I would just swoop through and overtake them. There is a LOT of time to be gained there

 I kinda understand what he's coming from really. LU feels like a Spanish Soap Drama with awesome wrestling. 

The way the promos are packaged, the video work, the cuts, it feels like watching a TV drama instead of a wrestling show. There is no Kayfabe or suspension of reality since you know it's just a tv drama.

Maybe that's why Cornette hates it due to his old school way. 




 If 100% of the people using mobile phone in the world uses smartphone, yes. 

But since not everyone is, hence the logic is still Call -- Timeout -- Voicemail. Everything is standardised, no matter what phone you use and no matter what country you use that phone in 




 Hmm

I'd say the heavier, brushless motor means that you have a better control on your steering (no more gear meshing feeling) and you will get better road feedback as well

Also the stock rim that comes with the set feels awesome and robust 




 any game that supports directdevice should work with the wheel. I've even used it for Formula 1 Championship 99-02

 Well if I would have to compare them in Laymen's term

T300RS - McLaren P1

G27 - Nissan GTR

Microsoft Wheel - Suzuki Wagon R.

And yes, the extra that you pay for it are worth it.  




 I agree, except the for your second paragraph. They do not "pick" Project Cars, they were chosen by the developers to help with the handling and give feedbacks. 

There are no perfect simulators out there and I doubt there ever will be. Hence why I just race and have fun on them all.  




 A returning Hell Rock would have been much better

 With an L motor? No. Especially when the car is around 1kg ++
Need to use the RC motor for that 









 The texture for the skins does not look high res tho (pixelated sponsors). Might need to double the size next time 




 Imagine if he debuts with the Big Show's music

Wellll!! Well it's the Big Joe! It's the Big Bad Joe toniiight!~ 




 I don't think Pirelli could bring that much tyres. They would have to pick a tyre in a certain amount of time before a race so that Pirelli could handle the logistics 









 Track specific bug. Had no issues with other tracks atm 









 Being a real life Batman 




 I was racing online at Bathurst last night. I was on pole, and was looking forward to a clean race since the other guys were fast on the straights, but my car was fast on the twisty bits, hence I would be out of harm's way when cars thread the needle on the top of the hill

But it turned into a sham quickly. At the start, the guy in third jumped the start, and hit me. Not only that I have now a broken car, I ALSO have deemed to jumped the start, even tho it was not my fault. 

As I trundled along avoiding the mass accident on top of the hill as I expected to happen, I pitted, sure to be able to challenge for some consolation places. 

But due to the auto pit exit, the bloody game said that I cut the corner when exiting the pits. And I have a bloody 1 MINUTE penalty. 1 minute! How the bloody developers think that 1 minute is a good penalty for corner cutting?

Now that I have lost a lot of time for that penalty, I have to pit for a second time to fix my car, and I thought the first penalty was my own fault, so I slammed on the brakes before the manual control was handed back to me when I exit the pit lane. But lo-behold! I was given ANOTHER BLOODY 1 MINUTE PENALTY.

TL;DR: Corner cutting is buggy, and the penalty should be lessen to 5 seconds 




 Depends on the racing series. Most FIA sanctioned race will penalise the driver that ignores the blue flags three times.  




 Microphone on a pole match 




 Because Steph, as with Hunter is a fitness freak. Both of them even have a fitness video.

Shane meanwhile has not been working out for a while, and i doubt he could work in the ring anymore unless he starts back from basic 




 do you have anything smaller?

 watched that Wrestle 1

Goldberg entering one changing room, and exiting another

Altho I'm more sorry to see them retire KroniK.  




 Years of experience. Really. You'd develop like a 6th sense via adjusting where would the guy be in relative to you. Audio cues also helps 









 WWE is like reality TV drama with wrestling in it

Lucha Underground is like Wrestling with fake spanish soap opera in it

Others are wrestling with story if they feel they need it 




 Yep. For me it's HUD with mirrors, HUD without mirrors, no HUD, and then telemetry in that order whenever I cycle the HUD button in the cockpit 




 Last time I did a 12 hour endurance race in the old GTR game. After the race, I have a fever, was really nauseous and my eyes won't focus for an hour after that.

10/10 would do again 




 Goldberg is a poor man's Gillberg 




 Try moving the brake balance forward a bit. I set the brake balance at 64% forward on the Formula A car and I rarely locks now.  




 Yep. Hence why I usually brake and coast now instead of slamming on the brakes as hard as I can. Hard to do when a maniac behind just slam into you instead of trying to outbrake me :/ 




 I hope the tag match would be ala War Games, one by one a tag partner is released in teh ring 




 Depends. IIRC McMahon was furious when Punk and Cena did that spot, and the only reason they got away with it was that they were the top two guys at the time. 

 




 New Jack. Easily one of the most hated guy out there
He does not really loves wrestling. He just loves hurting people  




 Holy shit. I totally dig that guitar riff for Bork 




 I only bought it because I don't have consoles, and 2K15 is the first for the PC for a while.

Honestly tho they should ditch Yukes!. The lack of wrestlers were supposedly due to "storage limitation" but I blame Yukes! on still being stuck on last gen console mentality for that. Storage are cheap nowadays, and not everything should only be stored on the DVD/Blu-Ray. But that's Japanese developers for you 




 Brundle drove the Force India and found out first hand how difficult the modern cars are compared to the ones years before 




 Can't seem to adjust the brake balance in the car. I've been locking the rears on the Formula A and usually I would shift the brake balance forward for corners that i have this issues. but it does not seem to work as my rear keeps on locking. 

Manually shifting teh brake balance in the pits works, but then I would have an overheating problem as I can't shift the brakes to the rear.

Anybody else having this problems? 




 Sepang 




 Yep. just found out about this in accident last night. My sweetspot is 10. 




 I think it calculate the number of people clicked/searched for the particular show rather than the show that are shown on the network itself 




 Sepang will usually offer cheap tickets a year in advance too, hence making them even cheaper 




 CM Punk VS Cena (RAW) for the main event slot of WMXXX 




 Ed Leslie?

Oh wait, that's for his whole career

 How is Tamina related to the Ano'ai? through her mom? Because IIRC Snuka is not related to them 




 Has he changed his style in TNA? I mean he was famous for being sloppy in WWE, but has he turned for the better in TNA? 

Never saw his match in TNA, well basically TNA in general as it's not shown in my country, so i'm legit curious 




 It was badly executed, I'll give you that. And once he won you knew what the main event for WM is 




 Uhaa-man will win it away from Hooah-man! 




 It's called Kanji and both Japanese and Chinese use them 




 What /u/cookiebombers meant was turn one was specifically tight. Too tight for any racing cars IMO. It's like a mini hairpin. if they had shorten the barriers, I think it would have been much better  




 An interesting fact about the last Monday Nitro, Road Dogg, who was released from WWE due to drugs, was at Panama City trying to get a job with WCW that day. He was surprised to see Shane McMahon there instead 




 JAVA uses NPAPI to run on browsers, and for some reason Chrome has disabled it starting in April 2015. Hence live timing sites that relies on JAVA would not work now.

Enabling NPAPI in Chrome Version 42 and later

In your URL bar, enter:

Click the Enable link for the Enable NPAPI configuration option.

Click the Relaunch button that now appears at the bottom of the configuration page.

 because they are face instead of heel now? the switcharoo between them and The NEW DAY! is quite nicely done tho. It was subtle 




 It's because they used her for the whole taping session, which is why she seems to be on every episode. 

And you she needs the exposure. You don't become good from just hiding behind the scene. She might not be good now. but in time with enough experience she would 




 err I did this because I wanted to use only 240 degrees 




 But Rusev, we are already married...

 Also you can cheat the degree of rotation here. rotate until you see your DESIRED degree of rotation, and hold it there 




 You get the pack from pre-order 




 Just a thought, but is Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury are now MORE over as J J than when they were active wrestlers? 









 Happened to me last night. I had to uninstall Logitech Profiler to make it work. 

 




 Option - Control - Calibrate Wheel at the bottom

here: https://youtu.be/0K6Aiiz8RN4?t=1158 




 Wheel calibration menu? I set mine at 240 there 




 No assist here. Brakes feels okay. The default setting for every car is 90% brake pressure, hence even if you are stomping the pedal your car is only using 90% brakes. It might be to help newer drivers not to lock their brakes? Try changing it to 100% 




 I was listening to music during the game downloading session and I forgot to pause it when I ran the game

It was this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GVIMWt8q2Q 




 Also some of this short reign were in Russo years where they need something to get viewers to watch their product. Title Changes were the easiest hook

Testing Project Cars for teh first time. Default graphic settings on a GTX970 @1080p. FPS counter on top left

Must say it looks good 




 For some reason when I checked the system log for the game it states

Nvidia SLi false
AMD Crossfire false

I am using 970 SLi. So yeah. It does not detect my SLi

 




 They are being courted by ROH (long term contract), LU (for season 2) and TNA (big contract) as reported by Wrestling Observer Newslette 




 Had some issues with Logitech Profiler and Project Cars. When the game starts, apparently Logitech Profiler (running in background) would crash, and restart. This will lead to the game being forced back to the foreground. In some rare cases, the game would not show up even if you click on the icon on the taskbar

Solutions:

If you are using logitech peripherals like controller and steering wheel, run the game in Windowed mode. 

Either that or uninstall Logitech Profiler altogether if you're not using any Logitech peripherals 














 Currently I am taking "TNA is dead" with a grain of salt. It's like a new meme of wrestling. 

With the report that they are talking to Young Bucks, I don't think their position is that bad. Not making as much as they would like, yes, but not as bad as people are making them to be. 

 




 All I can think of is "That would definitely fail side impact crash test" 









 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzmI3vAIhbE 




 I would accept it if it's just for a special show, not if it's used for every match.

Most wrestling matches are built up slowly to that crescendo, that apex if you will. And the moves, such as signature and/or finisher is a guide for the viewers.  




 The only thing I hate about it is the upper orange/red swoosh on the nose make the nose looks like it has two section, ala the old stepped nose. 




 They should have made Ambrose vs Rollins match last. by the time Orton vs Reigns was up, i stopped watching knowing they can't top any other segments of the night 




 I read that at "#perverse" for some reason  




 Not me. Newer cars have those sleeker looking profile  




 Their Iron Man match in FCW was awesome as well 




 Rene Rast uses Project Cars for training and track learning

 rFactor solved this years ago IMO by not having any pit crew animation, and you have to target a red box in your pit box. A good driver could save loads of time attacking the pit lane  




 which should be easy. WMD forums would be full of custom skins next week 




 Foley winning the World Title the first time. We only had Monday Night Raw in my country at the time, and it was pre internet days so nobody knows the results in advance. 

Also the night when Jericho beats HHH for the world title in RAW. Fuck the ending where he has to give back the belt tho 




 They were part of Back Street Krew, which makes sense 




 IIRC Rikishi was with the Undertaker's group of backstage enforcers, the Back Street Krew 









 Prost was Ligier, which was quite a good midfield team. And they were never backmarkers. 

Prost and Panis could, and should have better results, but Panis never did show all the promise he had before his nasty accident, and Prost was never a good team boss.  














 Depends. The reason it would work in WEC is because the top teams are all factory teams, each running three cars, and each are backed by a powerful car company budget. 

The same rule in F1 would quickly kill of the non works team that are struggling like Sauber and Marussia. And remember, the 3 car per team idea was also floated in F1 but quickly shot down by fans themselves. 




 As a Malaysian they also have cheaper price for Local students. Some fans recycle their old university card to get in cheaper 




 your explanation made me realise why they changed to rumblestrips instead of painted concrete sidewalk kerbs years ago 




 Ironically if not for Nando's toy throwing tantrum, McLaren would have comfortably win the 2007 WCC if not of they being thrown out of the championship for constructors 




 24 hour race car, which I think is a LMP1 car for all intent and purposes. Lego took some liberty I think. But I like it due to I can modify it with my own remote control and lego engine with minimal change. 

The generic F1 car model is awesome due to the pushrod suspension, something that actually worked well and made it easy for me to explain how F1 suspension works to other people 




 Hmm Naomi and Cameron looks to have normal body size, as well as Emma. 

But seriously she does seem to be thinner as you said 




 Also they have backstage duties as well. Producers I think? Wrestling means they would have less time fore their real jobs 




 I just realised that Paige actually has a hot body but her current costume makes her look slim 




 It's actually an easy way for the drivers to locate the apex of the corner, hence why they are everywhere, even at street circuits 




 Depends. Some of the drivers who grew up in the Senna era like Alonso and Hamilton actually wanted to drive for McLaren rather than Ferrari 




 I am 30 and I also love Lego

 All broadcasters have streaming option IIRC. Fox in Asia have Fox Sports Play. NBC has their own streaming, altho according to people here it's a bit laggy, and most of the people who get the Sky broadcast is using NowTV. 

In fact, for Fox, while the TV only shows the race, for the online stream the have dedicated onboard and pitlane stream as well 




 I tried to get into the site after the race started. I can't due to all the traffic. still needs a long way to go before it's a feasible pay option 




 0 lap gap, but how many seconds? 




 streamup is horrible once it get a lot of viewers. Try using gaminglive.tv as alternative 




 Or he could slowly loose all of his eccentric character, and by the end of his run, have a looser retire match against his brother. At the end, he's no longer goldust, and lost as Dustin, passing the torch of the bizzare character to his brother 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0F2Gu3GGqw 




 Less family friendly but not as hardcore as ECW or even during Attitude Era.

To be honest with all the incidents and death in wrestling after the Monday Night Wars have ended, they (the wrestling industry as a whole) realised that they need to tone down most stuffs for the benefit of the wrestlers themselves 




 time and money constraint I would think. they took an existing nose and front wing assembly and modified it 




 It's a Malaysian plane bound to Malaysia with a whole lot of Malaysian families. It was like when JBL did the Nazi salute in Germany. 

Yes, we know you are a heel, but there are something you can't do.  














 God. I am sorry. I meant old in the context of this game vs the latest (well on the PC for me) 2K15.
