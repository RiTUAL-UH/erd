 Ha! That is amazing! You got his expression perfectly, thank you so much! 




 Aw, thanks **blush** 




 Any help would be appreciated... Or suggestions on a sub/website where I can post this and get the answers I'm looking for?

 I didn't hate this. 




 Oh did you need dis? But **I** need dis!

 Thank you! This is actually very helpful. 




 Like, when something he says or does causes me to get anxious and I ask him to watch his tone of voice because it's stressing me out, he'll change his inflection to sound pleading/frustrated about what he did wrong, as well as gesticulate with his hands and it stresses me out more and just causes me to shut down more and idk how to explain to him that it's not unheard of for people who've suffered abuse to be hyper vigilant to body language... Does that make sense? 




 No need to apologize. Thank you for the suggestion :) 




 PLEASE do the world a favor and report this to the police, OP. 




 I can really relate to this, too. 




 Yep. This is about where I am. Depression turned to apathy/laziness, then I had an accident at work and hit my head on the stairs and now I'm just angry and want to die

 Well, I don't bartend... I am just a cocktail waitress. I really like it though! I get to talk to cool and interesting people, I get to have fun with my coworkers and I get to be myself! 




 It's weird, but after years of interacting with people, you just kind of *can* by hearing what someone says and by their body language just kind of knowing what it is they want.. Mind you, I work at a bar so I have gotten really good at remembering orders based on the "type" of person and repeating their order back to them. Usually I can remember orders for up to ten people and even remember what they got long after.... Now, names on the other hand are a completely different issue... 




 Damn good taste, dude!!! I usually drown my sorrows at a bar so I'm not "alone" but that's a great lineup you have so... Kudos? Sorry you're going through that, though :-/ 




 Laughter is the best way to **really** piss someone off quickly... 




 Nice try, theflylife13099....

 That sounds like a fun one. Any particular medium? Also, that artist's work is really cool but I think his coloring takes away from the beauty of it.

References can be seen on my tumblr. I can do digital or traditional media. Sorry if this breaks any rules, I just figured it's worth a shot. 




 I want to be in the middle of *that*! 




 Thank you! 




 Duly noted. Thank you :) 




 I would think it'd be a congregation of dentists... 




 That's relieving but I'm still pretty concerned it could become complicated. The hole is deeper than the photo suggests. It's about the size of my pinky fingernail... What type of tissue defect could it possibly be? It also looks like there is bone exposed; there is whiteness inside the hole and this hole definitely wasn't there before :x 




 This is the only place where it's possible to have a plane fly over a car driving over a train riding over a boat all at the same time! 




 Sorry, I guess I misunderstood... Since the images were hosted on the artist's own site with no ads, wouldn't that qualify? 









 Oh gosh. I'm guessing you're either a firefighter or an EMT?  




 Yikes, what a jarring scene that must've been! 




 I was living with my aunt, uncle and their two kids (8   10) when I was 14. I was recently put into the state's custody because my mom was an abusive alcoholic. My uncle and his family were kind enough to take me in. I was there for four months when in June, the day before my last day of freshman year in high school he just... suddenly froze up in his chair and reached for my aunt (she and I were standing right there talking to him as he was complaining about "heartburn"). It was terrifying; my aunt yelled for me to call 911 but I couldn't move.... That's when his sons came downstairs and made the situation even tougher- they kept asking their dad to wake up. I ended up having to take them to a neighbor's house when the EMT's arrived. I found out later that night that he was pronounced dead on the scene. The wake was very strange to experience. 




 No matter how old they are, it's always sad. I think I was more torn up having my nana die than I was when I saw my uncle suddenly drop dead of a heart attack at 51... I was 14. 




 I kind of became numb to it, too... I know that feeling :-/ 




 It's still very sad! 




 Yeah, especially when it's unexpected. Eery... 




 What the fuck? 




 Witnessing someone die in front of you... 




 Sorry to hear that happened to you. The foster care system in the states is abysmal. Sadly, I understand why, though... Over worked, underpaid social workers and thankless families giving them hell. Plenty of my foster parents only took me in for the money. Glad to hear you got your life in order, though! I can say I definitely learned fast how to advocate for myself and it's worked well for me still. Take shit from no one! 




 Damn great job ya did there!!! 




 3.141592653589793 .... That's about all I can do since it was what was on my graphic calculator in high school.  

I work at a bar and my managers get annoyed because I never carry an apron or a pad of paper. I can remember up to 10 orders without needing to bother writing them down. It impresses the guest and it saves me time.

 Fucking grackles... Clever little assholes. 




 Wow, you have such an amazing body! I'm envious! :) 




 Thank you! :) 




 We usually try to keep all our kitchen gadgets unplugged when they're not in use 




 zero, I suppose. I didn't even use a flame, I just kept a steady flow of hot running water on it. Though, you can totally use a crockpot on low for simmering bones, too! 




 Never ever thinkin' there was trouble in the water they were drinkin', they just guzzled it down 




 I had to work the rest of my shift so I left it simmering in hot water for a few hours (not boiling though!). I put it in a to-go box and carried it home in my bag and immediately left it outside to dry and let bugs pick off any extra flesh. I work as a cocktail waitress so I kind of just dicked around on my shift since it was slow anyway. 




 Oh! I work at a restaurant in the boston area. They had a whole pig roast and I had to work the day of my birthday so I asked them to let me have the skull. I cleaned it out during my shift and brought it home with me. 




 Thank you! :) 




 [After cleaning it out, it sat in the sun for a week.](http://i.imgur.com/9btHYMX.jpg) It's now in a peroxide bath for sanitizing and whitening.
