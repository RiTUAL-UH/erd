 I put it in my diary at a particular time, and treat it like a doctor's appointment. Once I'm there it's all good, I just get on with it. I don't think about whether I like it or not, I just go. I usually find it a good break from the stress of work, and I try to give myself a mental break from thinking about work, so it turns into a more positive experience. 




 How was it? 




 I don't quite get cover letters. I have a feeling most employers skip straight to the resume. But you don't want to be that person that looks like they didn't care enough to write one. 

I feel like it's like putting those edible flowers on desserts. I don't know if you've ever had a dessert with edible flowers, but they  don't taste like anything! At least the pansies I've had don't. So pointless, just decoration. 

Then again, maybe it's to show you can string coherent sentences together in English.  




 Haha... thanks :)  




 Thanks! :)  




 In Manly, I like 4Pines but I don't know if they're really a brunch place. They do have a view of the water behind the ferry stop. The food was surprisingly really nice, and the beer was also top notch.

A lot of people have told me Garfish is good but I've never been there. I'm not sure I'd classify it as a brunch place but it might be good for lunch.

Besides that I'm sorry I don't know cafes/restaurants in that area all that well. 




 When I went to kiama we went to the markets. There was one on Saturday   on Sunday! They are actually pretty good - different from the markets in Sydney because they are larger stalls and they have different stuff - not just stuff imported from China. I recommend the Kiama Seaside Markets if you are there.

Aside from that all we did was go to the beach. It was pretty relaxing. 




 I love running!!! Except I got a stress fracture in my foot from running too much only on weekends for sport and not enough during the week (so didn't build enough muscle strength). Then after 5 months of waiting, I thought it was better and ran and it was the best... run... ever... until a day later when it hurt like hell and the doctor told me I'd fractured it again. I can run again now but having a bad foot put a lot of pressure on my other foot and I got a heel spur on the other one. So now I can't run without being in pain. I tried taking a lot of neurofen but after un-recommended prolonged use it really does mess with your stomach, so I can't have it at all anymore. 

So in summary, I used to love running. Now I can't love it because it hurts too much. But I still go, only I can only run properly on grass. And when I do I feel so free!!!

Nowadays I usually ride my bike. But if my feet aren't too painful I can run every second or third day and then ice my heel afterwards.

The other problem is I usually only like running at night, by myself, with headphones in, in the park - the perfect target for criminals. 

To be honest I think I exaggerated how much I like running... I think I just miss it because I can't do it whenever i want. But I really did only like the healthy feeling afterwards, where your whole body feels energised. I like running to music though because I can try to keep the beat. I also like sprinting... I get a kick out of it.  




 ~~Jamberoo is a little bit of a drive from Kiama~~ (oh correction - it's only 15 minutes... well, it seemed like a way away!) I drove past it last time but we didn't want to leave Kiama so gave it a miss. Is it worth it? I've always wanted to go there, mainly for the waterskiing. But then sometimes I think maybe I should just hire a speedboat and take myself on a river. 




 That's ... not well thought out! 




 Oh yeah, there is that lol. I just figured you wouldn't go visit that before heading out on a long drive, but you could if you wanted to! 




 Oh. Sorry. Basic comprehension is not my strong point. 




 As long as you follow it up with "cause I'll do all your shit for you!" Then that'll be sweet  




 Are you in Sydney? Depends how far you want to go. I'm in the inner west so usually hang around Glebe or Newtown. If you want more of a seaside thing you could try Bills In Bondi but actually there's a lot of great places at Bondi. I prefer sitting at the cafe down on the waterfront so you can watch the waves and surfers. I also like Bronte but there's only like 2-3 cafes. Another thing I'd think about doing is Yum Cha. There was a discount voucher on Groupon for Emperors Garden in Chinatown. http://m.groupon.com.au/deals/sydney/emperor-s-garden-seafood-restaurant-1-1/719919595 I eat there regularly and I like it. In the city if you like simple food you could try Jamie Olivers cafe but it's a little on the pricey side. 




 I'd second going the whole way in a trip. I also don't think you'll have 1.5 hours in stops because there's not that much to see on the way. If you have a second driver you can do a couple of toilet stops and have a single longer stop for lunch or dinner. 




 True unless they lose an eye. Gotta watch out for eye loss.  




 Yeah I also find this article a bit empty. I would think a discussion about the pay gap by both occupation and years of experience would be more insightful.  




 I've had plenty of guys offer to shake hands with me in formal situations. It's not weird to me at all.  




 I've driven in Vegas and around there. It was great. I'd recommend it actually. The roads are fast as they're in the desert. Worth renting a nice car for it and bringing some good music. I loved it. Also, take water with you and pay for the insurance. 

I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow but we looked into cars. If you plan on staying in the city centre keep in mind parking is really really expensive. Actually could cost more than the car rental. I feel like it's not worth it.

Also if you drive in LA get a good GPS with lane guidance. The highways there have six lanes and exits on the right and left. So you can potentially enter traffic from the right, cross 3-6 lanes, exit on the left, then merge with traffic on your turn. That was my first experience and quite scary. Driving in the US after that was easy. I only experienced that in LA though.  

But yeah generally the roads in the US are pretty good to drive on. 

You should just make yourself familiar with the 4 way stop. First time I got to an intersection like that I was pretty confused... even though I'd read about them first. 




 Also I learnt that outside Sydney servos aren't open all night. Lucky I was hungry for a late night pie or else I would've run out of fuel. Apparently other people have told me that everyone knows that... seems everyone else except for me knows that. 




 By the way, thanks for the chat. My sleeping patterns are all out of whack. The daylight savings time change isn't helping either! 




 Oh that is good to know about Copper Mountain. I heard the name on TV while here but that's all I know about it. 

Yeah the beer here is pretty nice actually. I didn't know Colorado was into craft brewing but it's pretty sweet to try the stuff here. Unfortunately I didn't try too much. The bus back from Aspen to Snowmass is deadly to weak stomachs as one poor sod on the bus and all the rest of us found out. What I had was wonderful though.

We put our house buying plans on hold for this trip. The property prices in Sydney have spiralled out of control so we sort of gave up for the time being. When I get back I think moving out of my tiny unit into something more liveable might have to be my next goal. :)

So happy to hear I'm not alone in my goals. Except opposite countries... you know what I mean... 




 Oh by the way. In my (completely biased) opinion, our coffee is also usually better. It's the only other food thing I really miss.  




 Sounds nice. I just wanted to go snowboarding over here before I got too old to enjoy it. It was a dream I've had since I was in high school. I planned to go to Canada on a working holiday years ago but broke my shoulder and my plans along with it. I would love to come back in summer. The whole Rocky mountains is amazing. However I may be out of travel money and leave for a while after this trip (no regrets though). :)

If you haven't been to Australia you might find it more affordable now the AUD has dropped against the USD. We timed our trip quite poorly lol. 




 That's pretty cool. I think that's the main problem when people try Vegemite. They don't know how to eat it and use way too much. Glad you liked it! :) 

I do like Colorado. It's actually a lot like New Zealand's South Island but with better snow and more trees and wildlife. NZ has nice lakes though that you can see from the ski fields. I love nature so it's good for me. :)  




 I did it too and I also felt this way when answering some of the questions. They would lead off previous questions but I didn't feel like the following question was relevant anymore after my previous answer. Crafting surveys is actually pretty hard.  




 I think I stopped playing games as much when I started working full time. In high school and uni I'd spend hours each week. But now my free time is very limited. So it's more a changing lifestyle thing, rather than being because I gained access to a smart phone.  




 Haha. That is a very Australian meal! I've never heard of an American eating Vegemite. How did you get into that? Have you been to Australia? 

I am in Snowmass on a short visit. Leaving tomorrow to our last stop before heading home. We saved for years to come to the US and Canada and followed the storms here. It's very pretty   the snow has been amazing. The only thing I've found is that I really feel like I don't fit in at  all. But then I think the people here are also not your typical Americans/people. I have never seen so many private jets in one place. I also don't think many of the people here are actually from Colorado. I reckon we should have spent a day or something in Denver but we only went through the airport. 




 I'm an Australian actually in Colorado. I don't know why but I miss Australia quite a lot here. Maybe you should move to Australia. Sounds like you would fit in well.  




 I am a female who works in IT. After many years of gaining experience I feel I have much more equality, and I am generally well respected now. I do feel on par with my colleagues.

But I truly believe this might not have happened had I not worked for a federal government department with intake quotas. Their policy is not to employ 50% of each gender, but for a graduate year to employ the same proportion of graduates by gender. So if in 2015, 20% of grads were female, they'd aim to hire 20% of their intake as females.

It's a little simpler for graduates though. It's even harder for companies to find women with experience further along in their careers also because many are also not given the same career advancement opportunities once initially employed. 

I'm glad to say that was not the case for me though, and I owe quite a lot to equal opportunity and gender equality programs, along with a lot of hard work on my part in overcoming these issues.  




 I've claimed using the CBA credit card with Zurich too. They sent a letter after I sent in the claim to ask for more details (it was a theft) but once I replied by email, they paid my claim. I always use it now. Just be sure to see what you need when claiming. I had to spend a day at a police station to get a police report about the theft... which was a little tricky with the language barrier. 

Just need to read the PDS cause you have to book with the CC, but they've changed it now from a percentage to a minimum dollar amount. I think it's $1000 now and your partner should also be covered. Not hard to spend that when travelling from Australia.  




 I know I'm just some random person on the Internet but please don't give up. People do shitty things because they're imperfect, not because you do or don't deserve it. I know what it's like to care about someone and get shat on. It's terrible, gut wrenching and soul destroying. But you're still important and I hope you will give the world another chance. I hope you will get through tonight, then tomorrow, then the next night. And I hope sometime you will see that your life is worth it.  




 I haven't heard of that podcast before. What is it about? 

It's really tough making friends and meeting people. Most people are up for a quick conversation but then go onto continue their daily lives. I guess you just have to go through meeting a lot of people before you meet one that you click with. It gets sort of tiring though I've found and unless people are kind of forced to be around me, like if they work with me, then it just doesn't really seem to take off. 

8 months is a little while. Do you still keep in touch with your old friends? They sound fun :) 




 Sounds like an interesting job. I do consulting so am often at clients by myself. The worst is traveling alone and eating alone. I usually turn on the TV just to hear other people talking. I think it's worse at night. 

How long have you been there for? My stints are usually only a week at a time so not too long. 




 Hi. Sucks being alone sometimes doesn't it :( What are you doing there? Did you travel for work? 




 Seems like going out in Sydney and enjoying life is banned these days.  




 I'll keep an eye out at Snowmass. I hope you get it back!  




 I'm in Montreal today and there were a lot of delays from here and long queues waiting at central station. Not sure if it's related. 




 I would have thought a zebra would have been a better choice for a bar code animal talking about vegetarians.  




 I guess it must be easier to clean. I see them all the time nowadays.  I'm not really a fan though. The water does drain toward the wall but I find it doesn't really stay contained. I also like shaking my hands in the bowl of the sink and it's hard when the sink has no sides.  




 It's all the people who don't like Hersheys coming together. i.e. non-Americans. We don't rub it in your face in person that your chocolate sucks though, we see how happy you are not knowing any better. People on the internet are just more honest. :) 




 Yeah Cadburys is actually pretty cheap. I think we can get 350g for like $3 here in Australia on sale. Maybe normal price is $5-7 ( http://shop.coles.com.au/online/mobile/national/cadbury-milk-chocolate-block-dairy-milk ). Also the regular plain milk chocolate is now fair trade so even better.  




 It's like chocolate but with less creaminess and also a bit more cardboard and chalk flavouring. Also it's harder and less melty. Kind of like stale chocolate that expired a year ago.  




 That's what I thought too. Otherwise Christians would still be required to slaughter lambs to save themselves instead of praying to Jesus who replaced the lambs. 

Sometimes I wonder if maybe he just didn't like seeing lambs killed and let himself get killed through a really elaborate story so less lambs had to be slaughtered for redemption. Maybe Jesus was just a simple vegetarian. 




 I went to one of the Lawsons estate auctions of someone's stuff in Bellevue Hill. Didn't buy anything just wanted to see cause I've never been. 

There was a maid... Like she had her own bedroom next to the kitchen and wore the little black and white outfit. A maid!!! Like from TV! !

I also discovered those auctions are good for furniture because people go for the art and don't care about the furniture so it's cheap.  




 So what you're saying is that it's both adorable AND practical! :) 




 I love how they are colour coded! 




 I am one of those people that overanalyses my day to day life and I always feel like this. Sometimes it helps if I lay in bed and think about where I am right now and analyse just the present. It gives me a short reprieve from everything outside of my room and I am just in this moment right now. Maybe you can try it.

Like right now I am typing on an iPad on my bed and the air conditioning is on which I am glad for because i hate feeling sweaty when I'm about to sleep. I'm a little tired and have a headache but I'm glad the day is over. I'm not going to think about tomorrow... Just the next 5 minutes and I'm focused on this message and thinking about how when I sleep my mind will shut down for just a few hours and me and it will have our daily short but very necessary holiday away from each other. 




 Hugs. We care. I know we are just strangers but I wish somehow we could take away the suffering.

Do you think you can get another job? Maybe something to help you pay the bills?  




 Hypothetically what would you like your life to look like? 




 I know the feeling of not being able to get out of bed. It's tormenting because I know if I don't make an effort things will only get worse but all I can manage right now is the bare minimum.

If you take the job and it doesn't work out can you quit? Maybe you could just try it out and see how it goes. Maybe it isn't as bad as you imagine? Is your friend working there?  




 Go to Target, get a set with a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and pillowcases. 1000 thread count is best so don't bother feeling it just get it. (Eg. 
http://www.target.com.au/p/1-thread-count-cotton-sheet-set-white/181097_white )

The Target stuff is good quality but if you want something nicer you can get Vue sheets at Myer that are a bit nicer and don't have the premium of being Sheridan. (Eg. http://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/au-vue-tranquil-300tc-sb-sheet-set-d-19653 ) Though if you want Sheridan stuff and have a car I recommend driving to the Sheridan outlet over near Arncliffe unless that is too far. It's last season stock but still great quality and a fair bit cheaper. With these brands I go for 200- 400 TC. (Eg. http://www.sheridanfactoryoutlet.com.au/sheets/sheridan-300-thread-count-caffery-sheet-set.html ) The honest truth is if you see no difference between thread counts get the cheaper one cause it's probably just wasted money if you don't mind. 

Get a mattress protector. Not the waterproof ones cause they don't breathe. Just a regular one. Tontine are good but most are fine.

Get a blanket, doona or fleece. If doona you need a cover. Anything is fine as long as the size of the doona and the cover matches your mattress. In winter the best and most expensive is goose down but it will be very hot in summer. I have different toppings for summer and winter. 

Get a pillow. This part I suck at. Everyone likes different pillows. Get a pillow protector. Nothing fancy. The $5 ones from kmart will do. It will make your pillow last longer ie. Not go yellow as fast. 

Also don't buy white. Your sheets will look dirty fast.

And don't wash fitted sheets with hot water. It destroys the elastic.

Oh and everything above should be cotton apart from the blanket, doona, fleece or throw (ie. The warm layer). Though a cotton throw can be good in summer as it has the weight without being too warm.

Also don't buy European pillows or pillowcases or decorative cushions. Useless.  




 I moved out about 22 or 23. It really became necessary when I was studying and working in the city. The 3 hour return commute from my parents wasn't working for me anymore.  




 Here in Australia I have never used up my sick leave allowance... ever... my boss even let me use it when I got my wisdom teeth pulled which I'm not sure is strictly sick leave as it's planned. It would be against the law here to force someone to come to work when they are sick and have a doctor's certificate proving it. Workers here are entitled to 10 days per year when full-time. 




 [Identical](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ed/c1/b0/edc1b0e2431d14eddc848353475d93eb.jpg) 




 China hates Japan because of what they did in the war. I don't see why they would bother attacking Australia. They can mostly already get what they need from us. 




 So wouldn't that put Australia on par in terms of progressive-ness? Is there something else as well?  




 It's like everyone's forgotten that China and Australia fought together at one point. 

Not saying we should side again but why do we have to side with anyone.

Japanese leaders weren't completely removed from ruling after the war like they were in Germany. See http://www.crf-usa.org/election-central/bringing-democracy-to-japan.html
The current government descends from that... I think China still feels that was not right but had little say in it at the time and will not accept Japan's many apologies while they feel that the same organization that commited what were horrific war crimes against them, are still in power. To understand why China hates Japan look at the massacres and war crimes they committed.

China is growing to a position of power but they have so many internal problems at the moment without involving other countries. They have the power to bully Japan on the side but probably no interest in taking it too far right now.  




 Sounds like you have a warranty on the battery so yeah this makes the most sense. But do you know someone who can take it out and put it back in for you? Cause obviously sounds like you can't drive the car there to get someone to do it. It's actually pretty simple but if you're not good with cars you might want someone else to do it. 




 There is a Kmart Tyre and Auto on Booth Street or one at Broadway near the fruit shop. Or I find Glebe Auto Repairs on Bridge Rd cheaper. If you call them they may have some suggestions for getting your car there or visiting you.  




 I'm curious to know why Australia is considered less progressive? Not arguing either way... but I would like to understand the perception.  




 I spent 6.5 years at Sydney Uni so ask me anything. But I'm Australian so don't know what it's like as an American. Though my supervisor was from the US so always told me about it. 

1) assuming you're coming as an undergraduate: not that many Aussies live on campus. Most commute at least for their first year. Otherwise it should be pretty similar to the US.

2) This is unlikely to be a problem. Sydney Uni is fairly diverse. 

3) Depends what you're after and what experience if any you have. If you have an RSA you can try bar work. If you have done some prior study you can do tutoring. You can do babysitting.  The Uni has a casual and part time job portal: http://sydney.edu.au/careers/finding_jobs/casual.shtml
You might need to be enrolled to log in.  




 Reminded me of this guy: http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-man-bitten-by-deadly-snake-grabs-a-beer-20140310-34iik.html 




 I'm not a parent so I feel rather ignorant. I have a relative whose kid only eats chips and nuggets and it seems rather unhealthy but they have a hard time getting them to eat other foods. I have heard other parents say the same thing about bananas or fruits. Why are kids so selective?  




 Exciting! Have a good trip! 




 I like New Zealand but I wouldn't consider it a place to go for job opportunities.  




 I'm not sure why this was getting downvoted. We are lucky to be in Australia. I always wanted to leave but now having seen a lot more of the world I can't imagine leaving permanently by choice.  




 Have pity on us who live next to dogs like that the rest of the year. Just kill me...

Oh and you report problem dogs to council.  




 It was a bit windy today in Sydney! I thought about going out but we ended up just walking about a block. I feel super lazy. Tomorrow I will go for a run! 




 I think I'm bored, but I don't have the energy to do anything. Maybe I should go back to sleep. 




 I love Christmas ham.  




 I have a muslim Jordanian friend and he said the prejudice is way worse there than in Australia. I would have never guessed from my short trip there... 




 Bundeena to Marley is shortish. Marley Beach is nice. 




 I suppose it depends on the kind of fashion you're into. Myer and DJs are good for footwear and work clothes. Myer is also ok for casual. If you want gym stuff then Rebel in either mid city or King St. If you want other casual clothes it depends on your tastes. The chain stores have the best sales usually. 




 You cant skip New Years Eve in Sydney. I tried it a couple of years and it was fine until the party in the city started on TV and then I wanted to be there in the thick of it even though I know all too well how the night is going to end. 
(Also dont watch the ABC coverage. Itll ruin New Years Eve forever for you.)

Usually the night starts off great. The anticipation of a great night ahead is building. Depending on what Im doing Ill get dressed up - heels, dress, hair, etc. or in a low key year  casual clothes. Im pretty excited about going out into the city. I try to drink heaps of water through the day to make sure Im fully hydrated and pack the fridge with some Gatorade for later. Im still feeling clean.  

Then you might have a drink or two before heading into the CBD. Here youre on the bus or train with everyone else still fairly sober and well-behaved. Everyones kind of in a good mood and it feels fun, since its the end of an old year and you can say goodbye to your loser 2014 self and say hello to your new and improved 2015 self who at this point hasnt had a chance to screw everything up yet. Youre a clean slate, and the crispness of the air conditioning in the train and bus just affirms to you that this year will be different to all the others - youre going to be a new person now.

As you arrive in the CBD and get off the bus or train, you make your way to your 9pm fireworks location and possibly your location for the rest of the night. Sometimes its Darling Harbour, sometimes its Circular Quay somewhere, sometimes its a harbour side vantage point or a private party of a friend of a friend of who the hell knows? Wherever it is, you probably have to stay on your side of the bridge or else plan to stay out until much later than you would ever have planned But right now you just need the best spot possible. The rest is a problem for later.  

If youre lucky enough to have found a harbourside party, great! Youre probably in the best position to enjoy New Years. You just need to take your own drinks and youre set. Just wander down to the nearest lookout and then meander back to the house between the 9 and 12. All you have to do is drink, dance and try to avoid getting into any fights.  

If you havent found a party which is most years then you probably will sit around getting slowly more intoxicated while reminiscing the last year, discussing any resolutions youre making and waiting for the 9pm fireworks to light up. If you didn't sneak any alcohol past the checkpoint.... sigh. Prepare yourself - it's going to feel pretty drawn out. The same boat with snake lights will go left and right in front of you, but its still kind of nice looking out over the harbour with those lights (as long as its not raining and you don't sit under a tree where bats will shit on you). Try not to get sunburnt too, that kind of puts a damper on things to come. 

When the fireworks go off at 9pm youre probably feeling like  OMG Fireworks!!! Ive waited for HOURS and they are the best EVER!! I love Sydney! Yay! By now youre getting a bit tipsy, all the children are running around on the grass with their glow sticks and whirry glow sticks. After that some families head home, others stick it out.

Then you start the long haul wait for the midnight fireworks. How this goes depends a lot on your location and company but generally if youre in a grassed area it involves drinking whatever you sneaked past the checkpoint, eating snacks, talking crap and waiting If youre comfortable and have enough to drink this goes fairly quickly, if youre not its slooow. 

Then, at last, the final few minutes to midnight. You can hear the whole city getting excited. This is the part where if you stayed home youd start regretting it. Everyone is excited to see in the new year, people are starting to bustle for a good spot to see the fireworks. Then the countdown on the harbour bridge starts, you can see the numbers light up and everyone stands up at once. The whole city screams out the countdown to midnight and there is this amazing sense of awe along with the collective sound of a few of those roll-out party pipes as the first midnight fireworks bless the sky and make the loudest thunder and clap and crackle, and light the sky with the full rainbow of colours. If youre near the foreshore sometimes theres music but sometimes the sound of the fireworks is too loud to hear it. The sound vibrates inside of you and you can feel the new year start. Whatever the theme is lights up on the bridge, people do their new years kisses, the party horns sound and you can hear everyone ooo and ahh at the fireworks. The fireworks seem to never end. There are fireworks left right and centre and you can see them and its amazing. However you felt about it earlier in the night, the wait was worth it.

When it finally ends everyone yells out to random strangers Happy New Year! as people start to make their way from wherever they are to wherever theyre going. Usually theres some aggressive teenage boys who push and shove and elbow their way through the crowd, like somehow its really going to make a difference, but everyone is in too good a mood/not sober enough to pay too much attention. Most people start to wander off and then you see the huge piles of crap left all over the ground and the poor grass being completely destroyed. 

As you leave the space between people gets a little larger. If you decided to go home from Circular Quay via George Street youll have to contend with everyone else. Its like the harbour was a giant stadium with no orderly exit strategy, just a million people who all want to exit at once. Most people are pretty well behaved, but some start pouring out of bars drunk and disorderly and getting into fights. Thankfully theres not the copious amounts of broken glass all over the road there used to be but it can still get pretty gnarly. Its been a while since I walked down the Rocks, but I think itd still be similar. 

Ive never caught the train at Circular Quay  it just never works out and I cant even tell how long the wait is because theres just too many people  so usually we start our trek up George Street with everyone else. People at first are fairly orderly, then as more time passes more of the dregs start making their way up with the girls falling over in their less than practical footwear, guys vomiting and urinating and youve got the best seats in the house to the worst show on earth. You probably want to zig-zag up the road and pay close attention to where you place your feet at this point.  

Its been a while since Ive gotten the train back from the city - now we generally walk a few kms to get home and if we're lucky we'll nab a taxi. By the time I get home Im either completely sober or feeling pretty ill, though generally I feel really dirty but also dont care all that much because I'm so tired. Ill collapse into bed thinking next year maybe Ill just stay at home mainly because getting home was so damn hard. But as I fall asleep Ill think of the smell, sound and colours of the fireworks and dream about doing it all over again. :)

Another option is to watch the fireworks from a park or location further out of the city. This can be a lot more relaxing, the alcohol rules aren't as strict and there's less idiots around. When you're not keen for the hassle of the CBD, this is usually the best way to enjoy NY's. Just as long as you have a way to get home, preferably walking. The upside of this is you just got to chill out and get home easy, and you will be able to wake up the next morning and still enjoy New Year's Day. 




 If you want to drink most of the public vantage points around the city areas are alcohol free zones. http://www.sydneynewyearseve.com/vantage-points/  Probably best to try to find an alcohol on sale site on the harbour. 

If you have some money to spend maybe you can go to Luna Park - I haven't been so can't tell you if it's good. There's different price tiers though, so I guess depends what you're after. http://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/event/harbour-party-nye-2014/73390

 




 Are you looking for something in particular or just keen for a browse? It's mayhem in the city, so I'd probably plan to visit stores in location order to minimise the time fighting the crowd.  




 I wish they were still here with us... :( 




 There's some shops in Chinatown that sell weird singlets/shirts. They probably have a VB one. 




 It was a really amazing and beautiful gesture to have so many flowers out there and so many people going to pay their respects. And a great idea to turn them into something and save all the notes.

I went there the day before they were removed though, and some of the older bunches were actually starting to smell pretty bad. I think it was good timing to pack them up. If a storm did come through as forecast and destroy the flowers more it wouldn't have been a good scene to wake up to. 




 If it's raining:

- Chinese/Asian places are usually open e.g. Chinatown, Cabramatta
- Some other cafes/restaurants should be open e.g. Lowenbrau
- Cinemas
- [Sydney Acquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/visitor-info/opening-hours/)
- Ferry Ride (if it's not too windy - but it looks like there'll be thunderstorms tomorrow)

Merry Christmas :) Hope you find something fun to do.

 I've found that most people I've spoken to don't know the difference between a virus and a bacteria. It seems that it's just not something people learn in high school.  




 No problem at all! I'm glad you heard my words and that I could brighten your day. :)  




 I wish I could hug you. You were desperate and you felt like there was no way out. Guilt is a difficult thing to overcome, especially when you feel like it really was your fault. But despite what people say, it is possible to change. You can still hate what you did, but you don't have to hate yourself. You're human, and everyone makes mistakes. You're not the first person to have hurt other people and you won't be the last. 

I'm not saying to forget what you did, obviously it is something that is deeply bothering you. In fact if we just forget we don't really learn from the past. I'm saying to separate the act from the person you are. You can be a different person now and perform different actions. 

Also mistakes are a part of life. We all make mistakes. Some mistakes feel impossible to let go of. There are things that I deeply regret and if I had a chance I would go back and change it in an instant. But I can't. So the way forward for me is to try not to let it happen again. It may, but at least I will have done my best to try. 




 What will you be doing in Japan? Maybe the change would be good. 

It's difficult when you're unsure of what you want. What are your options? Maybe write down all the things you've thought of doing and the pros and cons of each one and then once you've had a thorough think through, try talking with a friend (probably not your SO or her mum though as it might complicate things). Maybe that will help. It might at least help you clarify what it is about each of the things that you're attracted to and identify what's missing right now in your life.

If you don't have other friends to talk to you can talk to me about it if you want too. I'm all ears :) 




 Life can be worth living and it's hard to see that sometimes. It definitely doesn't and probably won't feel like that all the time, but hopefully there are parts that make it worth it. If you're not feeling good about not having a job... then the only answer to that is to get a job, even if it's not your dream job. 

Right now you're stuck in a cycle. You feel crap so you have no motivation to do anything, and the lack of motivation is making you feel crap. To get out of the cycle you need to start small. Pick something you want to work on, and work on that. 

People are giving you pressures because they care about you. But you don't have to listen to any of them, it's entirely up to you. But don't change things for anyone else, change things for yourself - to make you happier and your life better. You can do it, I believe you can!  




 Sounds like a pretty difficult situation you're in. Can I ask you a question though - what do you want? I hear you say a lot about what you don't want, which is helpful, but what would you like things to be like?

You sound like an amazing caring and loving person, but it sort of also sounds like you've put everyone else before yourself.  




 You've surprised me because I've been feeling the exact same way. 

I was really fit before but I had a stress fracture about 2 years ago and I've put on about 10kg. I waited a long time for it to recover (I think it was 6 months), but I couldn't rest it because my job requires me to move around a lot and carry my laptop around (which is not a lot of fun while wearing a moon boot). Anyway, I decided I needed to run, so I went for a jog one day and it was awesome... I missed it so much... then the next day my foot is in a heap of pain. Turns out I fractured it again. This time I had to wait a year for it to heal. 

A lot of other stuff happened in my life. I got married and I was much bigger than I would have liked. Don't get me wrong I'm so happy to be married but it was a very stressful lead up to the wedding. On my wedding day I nearly had coldsores but luckily somehow they went down. I have been in some very stressful situations at my work and it has really made it hard for me to feel positive. I am just so busy I don't have time to think about it most of the time, but if I did I know I wouldn't be happy.

There are a lot of things I don't like about my life. It got pretty bad and I was ready to let go of everything. At 3am I was sitting down preparing myself and a police car drove up next to my car and asked me if everything was ok. I burst into tears and he asked what I was doing and if I wanted to talk about it and I said no I just needed some alone time. He said if I needed anything I knew who to call. That simple act was enough to get me through. 

This past year a few people close to me have passed away - one to suicide - and going to the funeral sealed in my mind that I would go through any amount of pain to save my family or friends from that suffering. It has been really tough. This forum has been a place that I have been able to come and talk to people about things and it has made it more bearable. I really truly encourage you to do the same, and if there is anything you need to talk about or just vent then just PM me anytime.

Sometimes life is really tough but you will get through it. 

In terms of motivation, after the 4th death of a close friend this year I just couldn't do anything. I stopped doing the dishes, the house was a mess... things just sort of started to fall apart. I went to the psychologist and she asked what was bothering me the most and I told her it was the house. She told me to just pick one thing each day - like say, doing the dishes and do it. Each day has been a struggle but I am slowly getting better. Maybe you can try to do the same? 




 Do you want it to change?

I guess at the end of the day only you really know yourself. We're all kind of trapped inside ourselves to some extent and it's hard for others to see what we're feeling or thinking. 

But it doesn't mean people can't know you to some extent. I'm pretty private but I do let the important people in my life in. 




 How long have you been feeling this way? Is there something you're particularly unhappy about or just generally feeling flat? 

How you feel is how you feel, you don't need to feel guilty for those feelings. Almsot everyone has times when they wish for things to be different.

To me it sounds like you need to keep putting one foot in front of the other and trying to do things that lift you and make you feel like you're taking active steps towards something. Maybe it's something little like going for walks each day or sticking to a schedule, or maybe they're bigger things like changing jobs. Is there something that is most bothering you right now? Maybe that is a good place to start. What do you think? 




 I was trying to reply to a lot of posts but then my own day to day life   problems get in the way. It's not that I don't want to reply, just that sometimes I am too drained myself to do so. But I would reply to everyone if I could!  




 I lol'ed at ass o'clock :) 




 Do you think she left you purely because being a parent was too stressful? I feel like there is probably more to this story than that. 




 My favorite bags are Coach and Mimco. Mimco bags I only get on sale because they're on sale all the time. Oroton has some nice ones. I also saw some pretty nice ones in Marcs. Myer is worth checking out too. If I want something cheaper then I also look at Nine West although I don't think they're leather.  




 Oh... really... so I just learnt that "spelt" wasn't used in the US much. I wouldn't have even thought about it.
