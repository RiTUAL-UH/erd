 I don't know man. Do you like them? That's really all that matters. 




 Wear what you think looks good dude.

Something I suggest is to buy a shoe, and let it sit in the open. Look at it for a while. Try it on, walk around the house with it, etc.

If you start to like it, then keep 'em. Money well spent. If *not*, then return them. It's that simple. 




 I've been looking in to these recently. How do they fit? 




 What pairs do you have? 




 oooohhh, the way you worded it made it seem like "My Yeezys, or my Bred AF1s."

Like you were talking about Yeezys. 




 Around once a week 




 Is it just me or is there a lot more movement? 




 Need. 




 What colourway? 




 What do these look like? 




 Like the silhouette in general or a specific colourway? 




 I need to get a pair of these still 




 That honestly isn't a bad colourway.  









 Yep, it does happen to be on there

 Where'd the creases go? 




 I've been a bit iffy on these. How do they fit/feel? 









 I feel like you could turn this into a really dope picture 




 I mean you could go both ways. The gray would match a monochrome outfit. Gray/white shirt, black denim. But so could the blue as a "pop" piece.

That being said, I suggest the grey pair as you can match it with more, but buy/wear what you like. 




 For example, one of mine is the LeBron 9 "Hornets". Most people look at me weird when I say that, but it's because it was the shoe that kind of introduced me into all of this *and* the first shoe I bought with my own, hard-earned money.

What are some of your guys'? 




 You could buy a Size 9 in the shoe and maybe add an insole or two in the left shoe to make it fit a bit smaller? Idk, might work, might not. 




 You can try dipping them in melted wax and then a clear sealant. I mean I have no *real* idea if it will work, it's just a suggestion.
