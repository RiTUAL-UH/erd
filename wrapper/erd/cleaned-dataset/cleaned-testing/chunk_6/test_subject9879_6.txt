 The Macbook Pro is really a great option, and you can use parrallels Desktop to run Windows simultaneously. That said, depending on your budget - try looking at some ASUS systems like the [G501](https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G501JW/). They are equally good as the MBP. 




 Doesn't work when compiled with pdfLatex 




 Another point is top 10 is a bit fuzzy. For example - in materials science there are multiple subfields like ceramics, polymers etc. Some school may often be better in a subfield than a much higher ranked school. 
But yes, overall rank matters slightly - and the reasons have to do with funding. As someone who has spent their grad career in both a top 10 and a 50th ranked school the difference in financial situations is striking - and that matters a lot, especially if you are an experimentalist. 




 I am a huge Garamond fanatic - and consider the EB Garamond much better than the standard URW Garamond. I have been considering switching over to EB Garamond - not in XeLaTex -- but in pdfLaTex. Has anyone here succesfully done that? 




 Smells fake.
Especially, the following phrases jump out:

*lived in the woods* and *started several of my own businesses* 




 Have you thought about teaching at 4 year colleges like Rose Hulman? 




 If you are a condensed matter physicist, it is easier to enter academia in materials science - rather than physics. Just my 2 cents.

There are also better materials science schools in your vicinity than physics schools ([applying the 12 hour driving limit](http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-can-i-travel.htm?address=kansas%20city,%20ks speed=60 time=12 accuracy=5 u=miles hw=false m=false mode=DRIVING)) - except for CU Boulder. 

The best physics programs are almost always on the coast (Princeton, Berkeley, Harvard, MIT or Stanford or Cornell). And getting a tenure track position without a top 10 physics degree is fast becoming impossible (MatSE is almost no better in this regard).

But the midwest has several excellent schools - in Illinois (Northwestern, UIUC), Ohio (OSU), Iowa (Iowa State - Ames Lab). 

Of course, if your area of interest is something else then none of the above apply. 




 Background please? Like - why was the injection *malicious*? 




 The whole world wants to sell me something. I, for example remember when Quora was decent (it was not great). Then came the SJWs, and then came the Indians. 
IRC truly is eternal 




 The most important question here - Kate Moss flies Easyjet? 




 I collaborate a lot. I go by a rule, which has made me considerably happier now. I go by perfection on my own primary author work, and go by "good enough" on my secondary author work. 




 Crying is bad for you professionally - but the flip side is that academia often has piss poor HR - leading often to those situations arising in the first place. 




 Everybody wants you to do everything in grad school. Which is why you must prioritize. Do only that work that would lead to a publication - nothing else. 
Things can wait - no one will die because of that. 




 Well it's true. Idiocy should be called out for what it is - rather than hiding behind a veil of political correctness. 




 The vast majority still use MATLAB. But because of rising costs - groups are switching to Python along with numPy and sciPy. Try getting the Anaconda distribution - it has all the tools you will ever need and is completely free.

I still have high hopes from Julia, but the noises coming from that sector are not always very encouraging.
