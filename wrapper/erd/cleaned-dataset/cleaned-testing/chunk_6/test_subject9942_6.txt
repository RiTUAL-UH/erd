 because I messed up okay 




 hmm, okay that's very helpful, thank you for your insight. In fact it's better than most other people who give liek a criticism with no detail.

if they're bi but prefer dating one kind wouldn't that make them either gay or straight? (tbh, I was going to let it pass the bi's since it helps them but the problem is if I grant it to them why not gay or straight and I want to avoid this whole complication)

the main reason I don't think we should just hand out the identity, freely because honestly, people treat asexuality as a joke, not because they might not understand it but it's because of the dreaded SJWs and other fake people in this way:
I have seen cases where people claim to be asexual to deny sex (as opposed to just saying no - now I know you will say rape will happen, but it's just gonna get more complicated so it's a completely different discussion). Also people can claim to be anything under the asexual spectrum and we can't say if they're lying or not. Now I'm all for like you can be this or that but they just do horrible things (hypocrisy namely) such that it actually makes groups like asexuals and transgender people look like a joke. do you get what I mean? (think of Westboro Baptist Church onto Christianity, for example)

and yea, I guess asexuals do face discrimination (different word), though and I don't know right now, it's still 'relatively new' (even though 14 years is a lot). There are still a lot of things we don't know yet and this once again is why asexuality (awareness) is very important and I still hope to learn more about asexuality. 




 I just wanted to vent on this topic

I believe that asexuality is important in many ways.
to begin with, it's a nice identity for those themselves that need it. unfortunately, we can't prove who is asexual and some people trend and claim it and might make asexuality look bad (it happens to any group). In fact, I am annoyed that people take the romantic orientations (I believe it was designed for asexuals so that it simplifies things because some asexuals still want to date). Now, as for me and along a few others, we agree that the identity isn't useful for other person to know (unless you are dating) because it doesn't matter whether you are straight, gay, bi or ace because we care more about things like personality (sure your sexuality might have influence but whatever). It is important to note that asexuality is very diverse and each one has different behaviors and stuff: for example, some you will meet will be sex-repulsed, others might not, etc.


so overall forget identity (just keep it to yourself, it really doesn't matter) what asexuality is more important for is the concept of it. It allows room for topics such as kinks (namely BDSM, I believe it's an alternative to sex), polygamy/polyamory, communication, intimacies/touch, sexology (it might sound ironic), aromanticism (these I feel are least understood right now), (maybe) deal with rape, topics and issues like Japan's sexual apathy, and lastly, a lot of transgender people come into the community which is nice and cool, and much more.


lastly, yes, asexuals are not oppressed (not that I am aware of) but the awareness again is not for oppression points but rather for spaces and benefits (and thus asexual awareness is important) for what I listed above. 




 I never said it was acceptable though, you are just assuming (you people please need to stop doing that), but it will still happen. For example rape, rapists will always exist and rape (doesn't mean we shouldn't raise awareness either, but no amount of awareness is going to stop rape, people learning self defence will) or people will do drugs even with awareness, education and being illegal (intervention and therapy sessions will fix these problems). 




 What Christianity is not:

-gay bashing
-anti evolution/science or creation vs evolution
-anti woman
-definitely not anti tattoos
-not all those things being misconstrued in media

What Christianity is about:
-God, Jesus, Holy Spirit (Trinity)
-grace and redemption
-hope and love

so can we not waste time on creation vs evolution debates? either of them, it( i.e. just assume that creation) happened already, move on and focus on the more important parts like grace. Also, it is okay to ask God questions (or question God).

One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?
Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. - Matthew 22:35-40 




 oh okay I guess I am attuned to it, so that's why I am having a hard time understanding.
thanks for being the most sensible here and well people talk behind other people's backs as it is. that's just how the world is. take care! 




 that guy was talking about SRS when I didn't say anything about it 




 I use you guys as gender neutral and many others do so too, so it's a common practice so it's a subjective argument

lastly, your gender is not the only part of your identity, it's A part (heck I'd rather see past your gender more of your personality, and yes gender can influence your personality) 




 children should be taught to (almost) always ask for sources or proof
(if it's a personal matter, ask the specific person for personal information based matter)

Also teach children to be kind (do unto other as you would have them do unto you sort of morals).
As for me, I just don't care (not in the sense I don't want to hear it, just more along the lines of do what you want-provided it's logical) whether another girl or guy does this or that (or not that I wouldn't support them if it seemed appropriate). I would recommend also that people focus on more important matters than trivial things, like whether this person did this or that (please be logical, if the rumor is someone fed someone else then it doesn't apply here) is not going to fix world hunger. (if you're going to argue what am I doing, myself. well I am studying hydrology because I believe having accessible drinking water is important)

ugh, if you are going to criticize me for celebrity matters, it's for entertainment (entertainment is necessary too, and as i mentioned, I like hearing people's stories, maybe they even inspire me but like okay it's not like there isn't anyone who has a new boyfriend every week other than Taylor Swift)

if I missed anything, be logical

honestly, I feel it comes down to being logical or having common sense. I know not everyone will 'be nice,' but if you're not going to do it, nobody else will.
