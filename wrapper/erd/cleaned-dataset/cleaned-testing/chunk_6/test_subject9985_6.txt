 Was the peanut butter one just people mixing up jif and skippy in their heads?

Nah, probably just a higher dimensional peanut butter. 




 You make a good point about evaluations, I feel that people miss a golden opportunity to improve every time they are given a bad evaluation. Does your club use general feedback slips for each speaker? 




 That's an interesting concept and would definitely help you learn how to give a perfect speech. But personally I'm not sure if that prepares people for the real world where they will likely just give their speech once. There's also a risk of over-preparing a speech and making it sound less natural. I'd perhaps suggest repeated a speech once but no more. Maybe even giving it again in the same meeting after some feedback. 




 Ah that's something used at our club as well! It's nice to get a variety of feedback, especially on the occasions when you have an evaluator who's scared to give constructive criticism. 




 If you feel ready for it, volunteer as Toastmaster. We had a new toastmaster at my meeting the other week and he added in a couple of new elements which helped keep things fresh and interesting. 




 **Mastery**
Waste 10,000 hours instead of mastering a new skill 




 I'd be interested to hear your views on this question as I think that whilst toastmasters has been incredibly valuable to me, there are a couple of areas in which it is lacking. I won't suggest anything yet though, I'd love to hear your unbiased answers! 




 If I remember correctly, is this the crash that circulated really quickly online and brought twitter into the limelight? 




 Hi Jstbcool

First of all, thanks for your incredibly well structured and thought out response. It's rare to see that on the internet!

I'm surprised I missed the effect sizes and it's definitely something that we need to be aware of, you make a very good point. In fact one of the things that stood out for me in this paper is the fact that they computed their required sample size a-priori in terms of power. It's refreshing to see people embracing the "new statistics".

I didn't mean to suggest that the participants played 8 hours of luminosity straight. However, having participated in a lot of Psychology experiments myself I felt I could speculate pretty accurately as to which of the two trials would be more tiring. Portal 2 is likely to be much more engaging and most importantly, fun. I think this would affect participants attitudes towards the testing as a whole, particularly with regards to motivation. Motivation is something we take for granted in Psychology a lot and I would hazard a guess that it will have had an effect even in the testing phase.

My third point stems from the reading I've done into the effects of nutrition on cognition. Nutrition is a pretty fascinating subject because there are huge pitfalls in a lot of the research and these are often worsened once cognitive testing is brought into the mix. It's not uncommon in this field of research for a cognitive benefit to be apparent on the day of testing, but to have disappeared once tested again a few weeks later. But, in defence of this study, it is a good starting point for further research to explore longer term effects. 

If this study can be replicated, it'd be interesting in the future to work out exactly what aspects of Portal 2 are causing the cognitive benefit. It's extremely difficult to break down the components of such a complicated game, especially as it wasn't designed to be a brain training device. I get the impression that dedicated brain-training games are simple because developers attempt to make them evidence-based. By jumping in with Portal 2 we've almost worked in the opposite direction; we have a game that may cause a cognitive benefit, but we have no idea what the mechanics are which make this happen. 




 There seem to be a ton of problems with this article and I highly doubt that there's really been any effect at all.

To name a few:

- When carrying out this many statistical tests you are almost guaranteed to get a couple of Type 1 errors (finding an effect when there isn't one). P values in this study were only reported to the extent of p  0.05 which gives no indication of what the actual p value is. With the 11 tests that they're carrying out in this study we'd want to carry out a Bonferonni correction and divide the significance level by 11 (0.05/11= 0.0045). 

- 8 hours of lumosity is going to cause a lot more cognitive tiring than 8 hours of portal. Lumosity is just not engaging enough to play for this amount of time. I highly doubt the participants were motivated to actually do the cognitive tests after all of the practice. 

- There is no follow up on these tests so we can't tell whether any effects (if they really exist) are apparent for a matter of hours or if they last for weeks. I'd wager that if you tested them again a week later you'd get null results.

 




 When they lost Modern Family it appeared on Now TV a day later. Maybe somebody just paid a higher price. 




 Sometimes it's awesome because if I stay calm I can generally transition from sleep paralysis into a lucid dream.

Sometimes it's just the most terrifying feeling, you can put all your effort into moving and nothing gives. You start to worry it'll never end. Luckily I've realised that sleep paralysis doesn't extend to my tongue, so if I freak out I start moving my tongue a lot and movement seems to slowly return to the rest of my body. Man, I'm weird. 




 As a 23 year old who has just had a cancer scare, this hits home pretty hard. Thank you for sharing this and I'm glad you've found meaning in your life, this message is something I'll be sure to look back on in times of need. 




 Is a black hole as big as it "looks"? From my limited understanding a black hole has such a high mass that light cannot escape. Is the material all condensed in the middle with a larger surrounding area that light cannot escape? Or is the visible size of the black hole also the size of all the mass it contains? Is it even possible for us to know this? 




 I agree, the thing that worked for me was to not allow myself any snooze time so that I just get up. 




 I can't give any better advice than everyone else has already, but you may find this article interesting.
