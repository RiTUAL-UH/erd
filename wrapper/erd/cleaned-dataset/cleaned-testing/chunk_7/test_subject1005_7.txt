 If you saw your job being represented in a movie, what did they get wrong about it? 




 Reddit is the only place I know where Armageddon is put down so heavily. It's far from one of the greats, but if you saw it growing up, you didn't give a shit about realism or cheesiness. It was pure awesomeness. I have a feeling its the hivemind or anit-michael bay bandwagon at work, because no one outside this site slams that movie like Reddit does.  




 When Lost in Space came out, I was probably 10 or 12. My dad used to drop my brother and I off at the movies while he was working (this was during summer) and we watched Lost and Space over and over and over again and loved it. Great movie for a kid. Watched it recently and still loved it BUT finally realized why so many didn't.  




 It is just a peeve of mine. I'm sure there are people who genuinely don't know that, but if they spent a week on r/movies they would know.  




 I swear to God if someone brings up John Cazale, I'm going to lose it.  




 Just heard that Henry from Blank Check died today or yesterday :/ 




 My favorite by far 




 LaMotta is way angrier than Rocky, but that didn't work out so well for Clubber Lang, so I'm going with Rocky. He's got the heart.  




 For example Maximus from Gladiator and William Wallace from Braveheart come to mind.   




 Far and away the only one.

 You're not Jonesy 




 During the interrogation scene, the Joke tells Batman "Don't talk like one of them. You're not. Even if you'd like to be." Now obviously he's referring to the police or anyone in empowered to keep Gotham safe, but by saying that, was he just trying to get under Batman's skin, or was he saying that he thinks that's Batman's motivation? 




 That's like saying I wouldn't take Daryl as a baby over Rick as a baby.  




 I read this twice. I still don't know what he's talking about.  




 Racism or the lack aside, that movie was so unbelievably unwatchable. It was the same joke the entire movie. Will Ferrell acts un-hard and Kevin Hart delivers his "What are you doing?!?!?" line. That's Get Hard in a nut shell.  




 Nice baby. What are you supposed to be, a secret agent? 




 This was pretty close to my favorite movies list when I was 16 too. Honestly your favorite movies are your own preference, and its really hard not to adore the classic, but the more films you see, the more your taste will change slightly and you'll find yourself being interested in films you never thought you would. Solid list though. 




 Completely agree. You're either a conformist or a dipshit if your opinion is different. There is no middle ground.  




 Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of them myself, but I understand the appeal and I think too many people want to "stand out" from the "sheeple" and claim they suck for no other reason than just to be a douche. Like what you want to like. There's a reason they make so many superhero movies and that's because so many people like them. 




 I agree to an extent. I decided a long time ago I'll never do a midnight showing of any movie. I also hate 3D movies- but only because it hurts my eyes. But prices alone are ridiculous. Movies can def be enjoyed at home usually with as much fun.  




 I am sick of everyone treating Armageddon like it is awful. Cut the movie some slack. You can find flaws in ANY movie about space. It is supposed to be fun and goofy and I'm really tired of people, r/movies especially, putting it down so frequently.  




 What bugs you about movies, theaters, r/movies and more? You get a full license to bitch and complain about what drives you nuts about certain movies or about those whose opinion differ.  




 In City Slickers 2, Mitch's daughter Holly makes an appearance but when asked about her little brother, she claims he is hiding.  




 Different strokes. I know some people really like it because they claim they "got" it. Its just too out there for me. Slow. Unclear. Artistic? Not my thang.  




 Only God Forgives. You all know why.  




 No, its just one of my all time favorites.  




 I love that Captain Amazing is ACTUALLY billionaire Lance Hunt, but no one knows. Because Lance Hunt wears glasses. Captain Amazing doesn't wear glasses. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE! HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE! 




 The movie was def cool. That being said there are plenty of cool movies that ALSO don't deserve the insane hype and posts.
