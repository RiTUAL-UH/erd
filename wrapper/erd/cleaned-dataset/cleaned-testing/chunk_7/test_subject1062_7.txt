 Here is a list of some restaurants and bars:
Greenville - Winslows Tavern, Christie's Euro Pub, Atavola, Carolina Ale House, AJs, CPWs, Wasabi 88, Starlight Lounge (trendy), and Villedge

Kinston (about 25 minutes away) - Mother Earth Brewery, Ginger, Red Room, Boiler Room and Chef and the Farmer (Top 100 rest. in America) 
                  
                   




 Greenville is not as bad as people are saying.  Granted I just moved from there for a job, but my 5 year tenure there was not bad.  I was not a student there, but in my late 20s.  Apartment-wise look in the Wimbledon and Madison (used to called Hyde Park, until they renovated them).  I lived in Wimbledon for 3 years and enjoyed it.  As far as things to do go, most people are right there is not a whole lot, especially if you don't want to party with 20 year olds.  There are some descent restaurants in the area. Like people said you can kayak, fish, go to the beach, hike and scuba with all in day trip range.  Raleigh is also only an hour or so away, so you got that.  Like everybody has been saying avoid west of Evans and north of 5th at all costs.  I recommend staying in the vicinity of Arlington/Red Banks Rd.  Would I want to be there for long, absolutely not, but for a short period, i.e. grad school, you can deal with it.
