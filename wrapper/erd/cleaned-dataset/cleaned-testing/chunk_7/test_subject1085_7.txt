 Sorry if I upset you! This isn't me. This was a girl in my class! That was the statistic and "proof" that she showed! I thought it was absurd, and wondered what others had to say about it! 




 Thanks for the advice! That's not me though, a girl in my class was talking about it, and I was curious if other girls felt the same. I think it's crazy. I said it was me because people say different things if you say it's someone else. Thank you for being kind! 




 Well, lucky for you! There's a more recent one coming out this year! :)!  




 Yes, future. That doesn't prove it hasn't happened. Also, no bragging. I wouldn't want to be one of the people who are accused of "asking for it" because of the way I was dressed 




 Have problem now that I provided statistics. Everyone knows that any school crime report only counts reported which doesn't paint the whole picture.

 How do you know the last part? For all you know, I could have been. Had things said to me before, and now avoid it all.

 If I was "excited" to get raped, why would I try to avoid it? It's disturbing that you think anyone would be excited by rape. That's disturbing. 




 As i said to someone else, if you want the email to the professor who told us this, I'll happily pm it to you. I have no problem with you asking him 




 I'm not stereotyping people that get raped. I'm using questions that people actually ask when people get raped. Anyone can be raped. I know this. I don't believe anyone was "asking for it". If it ever happens, I would rather people that believe that have no room to talk.
