 Sorry, I love psychology but not the people. I can't help all of the people, just the ones that I select. 




 Is it english or japanese? and isn't there internet puglins already to view? 




 Sucks how you live like an apartment complex, It be better if you were alone.  




 I don't understand this at all. Can someone explain how it is safe to pass on the left but not the right? Isn't it the trucker's fault for being unable to drive safely?  




 I'm the same age, OP. I tutored professionally at age 18, I'm going to PM you the companies I worked/work for. Got to help my graduating class of 2014.

 For the uneducated. The specimen is either: devouring its prey, or trying to procreate.  




 Love the last, line amazing. 
 




 There is a deal going on it's a purple vibe, you'll like it.  




 Not sure  about that. I live in CA and currently in my 2nd year into my Psychology BA. I got to a State University and all it requires is college  algebra and statistics. See your school and call them or when you arrive there speak to a counselor about this.  




 This is what I'm talking about, nice!  




 make me breakfast  




 These things are garbage.  




 Hola, amigaso. Yo perdo hablen  espansole.  




   went to college because everyone said it'd be worth it

 for the younger crowd. This is you in 5 years, angry and resentful of successful people. Don't be this guy. Find your passion and your hottie. 




 Every comment I post on reddit is poetry. Look at my comment  if you want to be inspired.  




 Greece should start WW3 that way all the Greece people can be employed and after they all die, it can't be poor anymore. 




 I noticed :( I'm being discrimated  agaisnt, it's  okay. some other individual  who is totally not me asked the question and I got amazing responses. Please hit me.  




 How does a note4 tie into place? Consider posting this cap on /r/teenagers 




 Bad choice. If you use a card with no protection, this will happen to you. I only was credit cards. I never paid interests on them. 




 No red, keep driving.  




 Life isn't your salary or who you impress. Find happiness and success your own way. 




 I gave mines to my cousin.  




 Along the lines of, "How are you?" "Please drink coffee with me, now" "for a while" "let's be friends" Like that.  




 Kid's  fault. he had it at yellow.  




 I'm going to Japan next week for school, and I was wondering if I can hit on the girl immediately and escalate fast. Is this behavior deemed inappropriate to ask her if she wants to have coffee? 

edit: oh I'm sorry; I thought this was ask **stupid questions **!! 




 I just hoard them. 




 I never tried the dotted paper, is it nice? 




 Here is the things OP should have known, no wall of text: - No porn, only right hand to wipe ass, and get da money.  




 Draw me like one of your S Notes. (french girls)  




 Idk why ppl go where ppl hate them. Reminds me when I was petting my pet tranchunie with my tongue.  




 Great Churn. Mods plz.

 It kinda looks like a water mellon.  




 **Tl; Dr** Become so poor, pussy won't even lick you.  




 Want to hear about why I call my Penis, Bobby?  




 It's best to do what you want, regardless the public will applaud you or appease you. :) KEY that fucker.  




 Not at that price. I'm paying over 300%. Like an Apple Watch, shit cost 300% then it should be. I'm sticking to my leather journals. Reasonably priced and well made for my tastes, this is an expensive tacky one.  




 Way to over priced.  




 Theses are like the beats in the headphone industry. People think paying for overpriced little cute shit makes the product better. I'm sticking with my Drawims302 noties.  




 that Notebook is so ugly and overpriced, I'd rather get one for 99 pennies.  




 It does, they'll never park there again. I'd write, "TESLA" on it just for kicks ; )  




 It was all a sting. Dog knew was going back to the jailer. Bribed snake to help him.
