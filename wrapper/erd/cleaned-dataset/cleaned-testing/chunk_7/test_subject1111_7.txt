 BBC:

1) Don't pay Sky is a basic principle

2) Sky Go doesn't work on modern browsers due to legacy Silverlight rubbish. IPlayer works fine.

3) Sky Go doesn't work on my rooted Android phone. iPlayer works fine.

4) EJ (OK, this one is arguable ;-) 




 BBC coverage starts at 7am, so race must be 8am local.

Its /still/ wrong on the official site. Honestly... 




 It bloody well shouldn't be so hard!

Yesterday f1.com said the race was 7am local time (I.e. 7am BST). Today it says 9am!

But it also currently says that qually was 11am to 12noon yesterday when it was actually 9-11!

WTF, have these people never used a clock before? 




 ...and maybe sinking the funds into buying F1 from CVC?

Red Bull F1 World Championship?

Works for me. 




 Why a nominal fee? Flog the teams at full whack and sink the cash into buying F1 from CVC - I see few disadvantages here.

My biggest request for them is to refocus on FTA broadcast. Sky can show it too, but it should be on the BBC too (in the UK anyway ;-) 




 Actually, I'm assuming that long term we'd see RB pull out of racing (Toro Rossi to Renault? RB to Audi?) and they'd be left just running the sport....like they do for loads and loads of other niche activity sports. The Red Bull Air Race series is properly cool and in case you've not checked, the city venues read like an F1 wishlist! 

Who do you prefer? The Red Bull F1 Championship run by someone who has proven track record in actually caring what the spectacle looks like, or the CVC F1 Championship, run 100% to make money for CVC, without exception.

I think I know which seat my backside is sat on! 




 Good for you. Personally, it sounds like a good idea to me. 




 Actually, they /did/ own it but sold to the BBC a couple of years ago... 




 Honest advice - don't worry too much about what everyone else thinks. Please don't crucify yourself every time your kid cries - some people might moan (or tut if they are British) but many will smile fondly and remember their own experiences and possibly even the fact that they were a baby too once...

I recommend books, toys and, if old enough, something to watch. Please /do not/ be tempted to drug your child. I would hope that the opinions of others are not /that/ important to you!

Parting words from a new-parent book I remember reading when we first started out: 

"When flying with young children, the single best thing you can do is have a double gin before you get on the plane. It won't help your child behave any better, but it will certainly help you to survive the experience!" 




 I have kids and the best job in the world isn't going to let me go and do bike rides with them, or let me build sandcastles on the beach. 

I like my holidays, I look forward to them and (because I live in Europe), I get to take them too ;-)

I also enjoy my job, but the job stays at work when I go on holiday. After all, if they knew where I was, it wouldn't be a holiday /anthony_hopkins 




 No, not too advanced assuming that he's up to scratch.

It's pretty gruesome though... Much more so than the film.

Why not read it yourself first? 




 Can't speak about Hammond but May and Clarkson were interesting people to have a drink with. Honestly, not that different to what you'd expect...

Oh, and he never hit me either :-) 




 Actually, I also have no idea of comparative tax levels either :-)

On a salary of about $150000, a UK citizen would pay around 35% tax all-in. 

I seem to recall reading that the US actually pays pretty much the same as the UK per head of population for assisted medical care only, but this is clearly way, way short of universal healthcare.

As a note, I have private health insurance...and if I'm seriously ill, I'd probably use the NHS instead as they are way, way better equipped! 

(Generally, private health cover is only used to skip the queue and avoid waiting times, which can be high on the NHS for some services e.g. hip replacements. Emergency cover is "at need" so if you need to be treated immediately, you'll almost certainly get treated immediately) 




 It's a fair comment, but I'm yet to see many advantages of the US system over the system here in blighty. 

Unless you are a private healthcare provider or drug manufacturer of course ;-)

Genuine question here: would you swap systems and, if not, why not? 




 God damn it your country has some weird priorities - you are one of the richest societies in the world and you charge kids for life saving medicines!!?

Kids pay zero medicine charges here and adults pay a fixed charge, regardless of the medicine.  




 "Ain't she a beautiful sight" 




 TIFU by getting up at 5am to watch the race when I should have just watched the highlights in the evening.

Honestly, you missed nothing by being knocked unconscious. This race sucked :-/ 




 The only thing that sucks more is being Fred.... 




 We had them at our estate in Jan filming a section that I guess will never be seen now.

They were out in the hills in rotten weather from 6.30am until 7.30pm, filthy, freezing and soaking and they had virtually nothing to eat all day until they had got back and completed the other filming that had to be done. 

And after all that, they still chatted to us after they had eaten and exchanged stories over a glass of wine.

If they had been told that there was no food that day, I suspect they'd have been pretty bloody pissed off then as well!

In short, we don't know what happened but I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. 




 Honestly?

Not nightlies. I'm back on stock 5.1 as I find the CM12 nightlies to suffer unbearably from slowdown and memory issues  24 hours after boot. 




 Number 1:

The Larch. 




 I'm quite comfortable enough with my sexuality that I can cope with getting changed in a "girly named" dressing room.

Are you? 




 I'm not quite sure what point you are trying to make here.... 




 Never knew this. 

Question: even though they don't need to, in your experience do they wear them anyway? 




 Actually, I'm semiserious here...

We threw EMC out and replaced it with Compellent about 3 years ago and have never looked back. Its cracking kit and does stuff that EMC are still dreaming about.

We've got about 800TB across 4 arrays now and love it :-) 




 I'd still buy a Compellent instead ;-) 




 Saved for reference :-) 




 Gutted, he's a hero of mine. Rest well. 




 Wow, that's some collection :-) 




 Yeah, read about that. I'm keen to understand what tools are available to me for monitoring my device.... 




 Hmmm, never been too unhappy with CM myself and I'd always prefer to fix a problem than abandon it and walk away.

Still, thanks for the feedback :-) 




 Running recent CM12 nightlies on Nexus 5, I've noticed that over time (24-48 hours) my phone's performance drops so much that it becomes unusable and has to be rebooted.

Like anyone, I've got a reasonable (but not excessive) number of apps installed and it would be good to be able to see if one app in particular is causing it, or whether it's something related to CM12 itself.

Can anyone recommend specific tools for monitoring long term health of Android, specifically memory, CPU usage with a particular focus on resource leakage that might not show up through normal avenues?

Thanks all :)
