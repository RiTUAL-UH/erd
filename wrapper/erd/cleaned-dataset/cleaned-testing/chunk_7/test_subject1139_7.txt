 I wonder if Galfa would go through with it. He's been turning to a pretty despicable human being so far. I called him a douchebag a few weeks ago and got downvoted. I don't think that assessment has been far off. 




 Not here but in Japan it's getting good TV ratings. 




 Anime in general tend to be prudish about sex, it's not just isolated to female characters. The commenter also seems to heavily conflate sexual expressiveness with intellectual competency, as if one cannot occur without the other.

While most female leads aren't sexually expressive I think it's uncommon in modern anime that they're depicted as inferior and woefully incompetent compared to male counterparts. Of course the commenter will just dismiss that notion with a comment like this:

Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm. Rarely is the female lead of anime world-wise or sexually-liberated. Westerners would accept that much more readily. But unfortunately, dojikko and emotionally stunted *-deres are 300x more common. 



















 Chlo Grace Moretz voice acting was underwhelming but the rest of cast were good, especially the parents. 




 Ema's story felt a bit rushed. I think this could have been better as a two episode arc. If the show is really going the Leon x Ema route, then two episodes would've been better for establishing that.

I wouldn't mind a Leon and Ema romance. Age difference don't bother me. It does feel a bit too immediate after Lara's death.

 




 The scenery shots in the last two episodes have been ace.

 I also prefer my suffering in bulk. 




 The way the manga showed she was dying was so sudden that it took a while to process. It also took a while for Kousei to process what happened. The cat scene was both allegorical and reality slowly sinking in. I think it was perceptive of the author to let the readers go through similar emotions right along with Kousei. 









 Heh. I find it ironic that Slaine was afraid that Inaho was exploiting Asseylum when he's actually doing that now by having someone impersonate her so he can make his power plays.

 A short post on [Garo Episode 18's Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/02/garo-honoo-no-kokuin-episode-18.html). 




  I feel spoiled now. Even now when I see other shows and they're characters aren't like Yona I get a little disappointed.

I really recommend The Twelve Kingdoms if you want female characters with strong character development. Also Beast Player Erin. 




 I felt bad for Yona when she couldn't answer the question about what she can bring to the table. Perhaps in the next few episodes she can finally put her archery practice to use and also grow as a leader. 




 The love triangle drama coming to a head right now feels kind of odd. At this point I feel like the focus should be Kousei's competition, Kaori's condition and their desire to play together again. But then again I also thought Nagi's appearance was also odd and that worked out really well. 




 To be fair to Kousei, the mixed signals Kaori are sending must be confusing him. He's even going to be more confused now that Tsubaki has confessed haha.

I got a feeling that Watari is going to see through Kaori, be a bro and bat for Kousei. 

 









 Hopefully they fermented that mare's milk. Apparently unfermented mare's milk is a strong laxative.

[Supposedly it tastes really sour and smokey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z35e-_YEzfA)

Also I wouldn't have minded eating salmon for three days. 




 Galfa is kind of a douchebag. Wouldn't have minded if he actually got killed. 




 I dunno man. The pitchforks are out and redditors are demanding an apology, Plumlee must have inflicted some serious emotional trauma on these people. 




 I get my existentialism from Gintama

Whether its the dent below your nose or the built-in microphone on the Famicoms second player controller, there are many things in this world that make no sense. However, humans are meant to eat, poop, and sleep. Everything else we do is useless. Our creations(Patriot) fall into that category. 




 That town is like a Costco where they force feed you samples.

The show has been entertaining so far with a pretty unique world building but the narrative for these small story arcs could be a bit tighter. The show gets the gist of it across but not the finer details. 




 I used to be really into kickboxing during the glory days of K-1. Also, from time to time I would look up fight videos of the top ranked Lumpinee and Rajadamnern fighters.

In general, my interest in fight sports (including MMA and boxing) just faded. I just pay attention to the bigger fights and up and coming talent with some hype behind them. 




 I like the pacing. It feels like the calm before the storm. This series has always been about the slow build up anyway. Each arc takes it time to present the details about the world and the development of the characters, which then culminate to a gratifying climax and resolution. 




 Why must Leon suffer so much!

I wouldn't mind a revival as long as it's handled well but I'm not sure if I really want it. That death scene was one of those exceptionally executed scenes that leaves a lasting imprint but a revival might weaken that effect. 




 Maybe "FLAG". I can't find a video showing the controls but I remember them being sensible. 




  I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life. 




 I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH) 




 I've been trying to spread the brilliance of Koji Yamamura but with almost zero success lol. 









 Cross Game and Aria. 




 Yun was right, the gang does keep getting weirder. Really curious how Yona is going to convince the Green Dragon to team up with them. Maybe it will be Hak who's going to do the convincing.

Not even an ounce of jealousy from Yona. Hak has his work cut out for him.

Also if you want another fantasy show with a badass redheaded female MC, I really recommend **The Twelve Kingdoms**. It's a slower show and far more serious and darker. The character development is some the most gratifying in anime and the world building is detailed and expansive.

[Just look at this graceful badass](http://i.imgur.com/gwJjSRJ.jpg) 




 Tropes aren't inherently bad...really there's a trope for everything since storytelling have been in existence for thousands of years. Tropes are tools, it's how they're used that determines whether the story and/or character appeals to the audience or not.

An obvious ending is not bad either. To me the journey is far more important than the destination.

 I just now realized the gray dwarves look like creepy penguins.

The dream scene was great. Really liked the use of color to accompany the changes in emotions. The quivering eyebrows were also a nice touch when Ronja was tearing up. Good stuff by Goro.

lol that knife had an obvious death flag. RIP knife. 




 It's not a question of ability but health. 




 The non-Leon episodes are somewhat entertaining but nowhere near as interesting. 




 Goth-loli with that submarine delivery and a graceful jumping follow through. 



















 Those flashbacks were a nice way of showing that the connection between Ronja and Mattis isn't completely severed, despite their stubbornness.

 But generalizations are fun and get easy upvotes. Funnily enough this is also guilty of pandering that it's criticizing. 









 I think [Liebestraum No. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpOtuoHL45Y) by Liszt would've worked well for this episode. It's familiar sounding but not as overused as Clair de Lune. 




 That's an odd watching habit. After 200 shows a rational person would have an idea of their taste for anime and know what shows to pick up and what to avoid. 









 The dialogue between Kousei and Kaori was serene with a touch of melancholy. Great stuff.

Unless the mangaka backtracks, I think in the end the story would just imply that Kaori is terminally ill but not actually show her death. I think this way it makes her story more about the way she lived instead of that she died.

 Mostly agree with you. It's hard to get into the symbolism and surreal expression of ideas without an interesting narrative and engaging character drama. It almost feels like Ikuhara came up with the ideas and symbolisms first and then haphazardly attached a story and characters to them. In contrast to his other work, Utena, the characters were the heart of the show and the symbolism were built around them.  




 I really really hope that the 2nd season of Knights of Sidonia receive the same quality of character animation. It probably won't though due to a most likely lower budget. With the Ghibli name attached to Ronja, Polygon got some good funding from NHK. 




 Mattis is getting all the hate and deservedly so but the Borkas were awful with their ungrateful attitude towards Ronja's sacrifice. Let us not forget they also shot first. 




 While Maria is performing good deeds, Saint Micheal is partially right that heavenly or witch interference whenever something bad happens messes too much with the natural order of things. Although he's also in the extreme end by not doing anything. Like with most matters, moderation is key.

Maria tries to stop the war mostly for the selfish reason of hating it, which results in her not seeing the bigger picture.

So, Saint Micheal does have a point but he's just a dick about it. With that said you should all still convert to Wicca and worship thy Goddess Maria.

 This episode definitely delivered the powerful emotions. Although, I was a bit disappointed with a couple of key moments that I was really looking forward to. The dialogue didn't quite deliver like the manga did in those two moments.

 One of the best anime shows ever. I'm not sure if this is the right way to describe it, but it's a mentally and emotionally demanding show.

Also, this was a spin-off of the bakeneko arc from Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales. I recommend watching that arc. 




 That court system is rigged! But I'll overlook the injustice because it was too sexy.

Shaba-da-doo 




 Mattis straight up turned sinister, almost like a completely different character.

Ronja's voice actress delivered a great performance. Also, in dramatic scenes like this, phonetically animated lip syncing is a huge difference maker in terms of bringing the characters' emotions to life.

 This was a fun episode, had me laughing out loud multiple times. The Titanic couple got me good.

Aoko was adorable in this episode. Secret best girl of Fall-Winter seasons. 




 Saazbaum's slide show of his feeling was really effective. Gotta take pointers from that episode the next time I do a public presentation.

It really wasn't though. The old man whispering to Decim, which elevator he was on in the end and his grin were all obvious cues of where each of them ended up.

 Please keep this family safe. Please keep this family safe. Leon needs to catch a break. For the first time in his life the guy experienced a semblance of family life...and an actual father figure.

I hope the show puts a stain on the white cape of the super perfect prince. Infallible characters are not interesting to me. 




 This episode left out a decent amount stuff from the manga. It was still nice but I would've preferred that it adapted most of the material since they're good. It also sped up the pace a bit and for shows like this I prefer a slower build up towards the big moments. Makes it more gratifying.

Perhaps they just changed the order of things.

 Akira remains the gold standard for anime. Plenty of scenes were full animation (24 fps). The lip syncing is phonetically animated, so there's no flapping mouth effect. 









 Best animal animation.

The adventurous mischief of Ronja and Birk is really charming. They also have great chemistry. That was a fun and feel-good episode until that inauspicious ending.

 The fansub releases are so irregular which kind of kill the incentive to discuss the show. 

At least I don't think it's as dead as the Sanzoku no Musume Ronja threads. 




 Sounds like this might be his third feature length film. I think his two feature length films (The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) were his weaker works. His character writing is great and shorter films play to that strength but longer films require more storytelling which I think he struggles a bit with. For longer films having a co-writer might be of benefit, just like Hosoda had Satoko Okudera as a co-writer. 




 Kaori smiled! I'll take any positive thing I can get. I also really liked that Tsubaki has come to accept her feelings for Kousei but also understood how delicate his situation is. I just wished this was done right after chapter 29.

The Watari and Kousei dialogue was great and handled with a light touch that made it feel genuine. Kousei was in anguish but not super angsty. Watari was supportive but not pushy.

 Do we really need to repetitively mention the death flag, I mean it's quite obvious what Kaori's part of the story is all about at this point. It's like watching Philadelphia and screaming "Oh my god, death flag" about midway through the movie.  




 Kind of felt bad for Jeanne. She dedicated her whole life for this moment and in the end she wasn't able to do much.

 Melodrama is not inherently bad writing. It's just another tool at the writer's or director's disposal. Whether it turns out well or not depends on how it is used.

This subreddit has a habit of attaching negative connotation to tropes and cliche, which is lazy criticism and lacks critical thinking. What should be criticized is how the trope is used and not the trope itself. 

[Tropes are Tools](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools?from=Main.TropesAreNotBad) 




 I maybe wrong about this, but I think this was the season when the league put more emphasis on calling fouls on contact. This was to boost scoring as a response to the low scoring finals between the Spurs and the Pistons. In that list there were six players attempting more than 10 or more free throws per game. 




 I want continuation of these shows:

**Natsume's Book of Friends** under Studio Ghibli with Takahiro Omori still as the director.

**Kino's Journey** under Studio Ghibli with Hiroshi Nagahama (Mushi-shi) as the director.

**The Beast Player Erin** under Studio Ghibli directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi (The Secret World of Arrietty) or Omori

**Tetsuwan Birdy: Decode** under Ufotable with Kazuki Akane still as the director.

**Chihayafuru** and **NANA** done by same studio and director (MADHOUSE and Morio Asaka).

For original projects:

A sci-fi show written by Kenji Kamiyama (Gits: SAC and Eden of the East), under Polygon Pictures and directed by Yutaka Izubuchi, Mamoru Oshii or Shinichiro Watanabe.

Any movie project by Makoto Shinkai, Mamoru Hosoda and Yasuhiro Yoshiura.

Pixar collaboration with the above directors.

Breakout project for Kiyotaka Oshiyama (Space Dandy "The Big Fish is Huge, Baby") and Yasuhiro Nakura (Space Dandy "A World with No Sadness, Baby") 




 Always liked Kuroda's composure. He's rarely ever rattled and just fights through bad spots.  









 When they suggested doing the horses in CG, I immediately thought of the horse animation in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, which I thought looked pretty nice.

 I'm kind of surprised by how stern of a teacher Kousei ended up being but in a good way since it's evident of how his character has changed. 




 I think the whole substitute thing was just playful teasing by Kaori that Kousei sort of took to heart. I think even Watari realizes this, hence the scene when he asked Kaori if she likes Kousei and why he keeps encouraging him.

I also think Kaori, unlike Tsubaki, is fully aware of her feelings for Kousei. She just strikes me as a more honest character (to herself). But as you mentioned her terminal illness makes fully engaging difficult. 




 Loving Plum's development. 




 I think turning him into a teacher is a nice development as long as that's the extent of their interaction. But I agree, the placement of the new character intro is an odd one since I was expecting more Tsubaki stuff. 




 The scaling down on the drama was kind of abrupt, especially since it has been so excellent and substantial to Tsubaki's development. I hope the manga doesn't put Tsubaki on hold but I think that's what's going to happen which would be a shame.  









 Showing Ronja take a nice hot bath to emphasize how badly the Borkas have it with their food and water shortage was a nice touch.
