 I think next week, I'll send out a message. 




 I'm going to go with 0% join for webinars, but I think they like to have a package of benefits to make it more appealing.  

Honestly, the Webinar people are really good at setting these things up, and they get a bunch of good speakers. 




 I believe they use it as a selling point for ACS membership.

  Do you really believe they were ESSENTIAL for his success?

Absolutely, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.  

That doesn't diminish he hard work or his investment.  Without a market for Telsa's cars, he fails, and without the California Zero-emission tax credits, Tesla isn't even profitable.  There are stories told of how close Tesla was to going under, I believe a couple of months from not being able to make payroll (read bankrupt.)  

Building PayPal is significantly easier than a car company, and the sale price of any internet-based company should be weighted carefully (How much did What's App sell for again?  Does anyone seriously think a mobile phone app was harder to develop that a car company? Luck  and a good idea is a huge part of the internet success, in fact luck is substantially under appreciated in business success.)

Here's a story for you to read: [Tesla Is No Success Story
Tesla is only profitable thanks to politics and tax subsidies.](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/06/03/teslas-success-is-the-result-of-political-favoritism)

Some quotes:

Tesla Motors, the California-based electric car start-up, has been the subject of a great deal of hype. With the recent news that it repaid its $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, it's now being heralded as a success story worthy of redeeming the failures of a green-energy subsidy program that has included the likes of Solyndra, Abound, Ener1, and Fisker Automotive. Since then, Tesla's stock value has more than doubled and the company is currently valued at around $12 billion.

and 

Even with the support of federal and state politicians, Tesla would still be reporting losses were it not for its ability to profit off of other auto manufacturers in California. In the first quarter of 2013, Tesla reported its first-ever quarterly profit by using special credits from California's Air Resources Board, which rewards auto manufacturers for the production of "zero-emission" vehicles. So far this year, Tesla was able to turn what would have been a $57 million loss into an $11 million gain by selling $68 million worth of these credits to other auto manufacturers in California.


Without a low-interest loan from the DOE, Tesla would have had some trouble getting started.  Sure he could have gone to venture capital, but they would have wanted a lot of control over the company, something Musk has been reported as being unwilling to give. 




 PhD chemist here, you are right.  "Simple" things are months of work. 




 You realize his efforts have gotten significant government support.  SpaceX is basically funded by a NASA contract, Tesla received a government-backed loan, and the sales of their cars are supported by a meaningful tax incentive.

It is unlikely he would have made it without the government, so this is probably a case of a perfect counter example to the libertarian dream.

 It's important to realize that, again, INCI names aren't chemical names, so several different materials can have the same name.

For example, acrylates copolymer can be any from a list of acrylate monomers and literally any molecular weight above 1500 or so. 




  put $1k towards a decent mortgage

Anyone who is making that much doesn't has a mortgage payment much higher that $1000, $2000 to $3000 for the mortgage is a lot more realistic. If you don't have a mortgage payment, you probably pay cash for an M4 anyway.  

That being said, you general analysis is correct, someone could in principle afford this, but it would be pretty dumb.  I believe most people who drive M cars lease them. (Assuming the majority of those with M cars aren't hobby racers.)  I suspect a majority of the people who drive them are business guys who want the appearance/status symbol. (that doesn't cheapen the car, just a society thing.)

 




 Because INCI names aren't chemical names, they are a nomenclature of their own. 

In this context "Alcohol" strictly means ethanol [as defined in the INCI database](http://www.cosmeticobs.com/pro/news/ingredient-of-the-month/alcohol-inci-alcohol-or-alcohol-denat-803)

 I believe so, you can seriously injure yourself if you screw up.  I think 5 mL of methanol is all that it take to blind you.  

Ethanol, you can drink an 8 oz glass and just have a bad headache the next day! 




 Pretty much. 




 Mercury is only used in one vaccination that children get, the DTaP, and the form used is not toxic to humans at anywhere near the concentrations used.

You could drink elemental mercury and it would pass right through you, the salts are substantially more dangerous because they are far more readily absorbed. 




 You are correct, they are both organomercury compounds, but different types.  Similar to ethanol and methanol, which are both alcohols, however they have drastically different toxicities.  A lot of ethanol os a drunken good time, 15 mL of methanol will kill you. 




 [Today, the only childhood vaccines that have trace amounts of thimerosal are: one DTaP vaccine and one DTaP-Hib combination vaccine.](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html#f)

So it's just the DTaP. 




 Actually, they didn't.  Aluminum is in there as a [adjuvent]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant) not a preservative, aluminum was already there. 




 It's important not to propagate misinformation however.  Also, the mercury used at a preservative in vaccines is a different compound of mercury, and isn't nearly as dangerous to humans.  

The mercury found in tuna, however, is more than a vaccination ever was and **is** the dangerous kind, methylmercury.  It's presence is largely the result of humans burning coal which releases mercury into the environment.

 Oh he totally was, but Diaz looked worse, he looked inept.  It was the right response to Diaz's style, that's what you do to one dimensional fighters, take away their style. 




 Condit was point-fighting Diaz, too.

You could also look at this as exposing Diaz for being unable to adapt once his game plan was taken away from him.   




 This is an opinion piece, not research.

 I'm actually going to an NSF-sponsored conference in July to basically do this. (I believe meta conversations are called "Communications" in academia!) 




 At the American Chemical Society Meeting in March, I was interviewed about the Science AMA Series.  This is the video the ACS staffers put together, I thought people would be interested in seeing it.  


Link to the video on youtube:

This is before a webinar I am giving covering science discussions on reddit:

http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/events/upcoming-acs-webinars/digital-media.html

(I'll post a link to the webinar on the day of so that people can easily find it.)

Hopefully reddittors find this interesting and informative as to our motivations and values. (spoiler:  we're pro-science!)

 Way too much work for the admins to vet websites reddit wide, reddit is just too huge.  Also, if something bad would come up from a link on an "approved" site, would reddit still be able to claim safe harbor? 




 Every single one of your comments in /r/science has been removed for breaking various rules, you've ranged the gambit from inane and off topic to homophobic and insulting.

And now you're whining to strangers about how terribly oppressed you are.

(of words or the person speaking them) fluent and voluble but insincere and shallow.

 Thanks.  In /r/science, we have an unusual situation in that we have an incredible number of mods, 814 last count, which gives us a lot of internal review of mod actions without the drama of having a public mod log or anything like that.  Because /r/science is one of the most moderated subreddits we get a people who post thinking it's any old sub that they can make their shitty, off-topic, political comments in and get away with it.  They can't (and should not be able to, frankly.)

While we do have mods from many different back grounds, I assure you that we don't have a dramatic ideological bend beyond being pro-science, as in peer-reviewed science.  We aren't pushing any philosophical positions, mostly we try to keep them out.  That's why his comment was removed, he's making a glib comment that is pushing a personal position (which is seen in his previous comments.) 




 In /r/science, the only time we look at behavior outside is to confirm a track record of poor behavior.  ( posting on a racist subreddit would tend to confirm that a user is a racist for example.) 




 It's because of a history of bad comments by this user.  We give temp bans to get user's attention, nothing special here.  It was a shitty comment that offered little insight.   




 He received a warning because of his history of bad comments, most of them have been removed for being overly hostile or political in nature.  It's not just this comment in isolation.  

Sorry that we don't feel like getting into arguments with hostile users looking to screen shot our conversations for grandstanding.

/r/science is not a free-speech subreddit, we have rules, we enforce those rules. 



 




 He isn't banned, he's just not giving you the complete story, like leaving out the parts where he is reinstated and given a warning to make better comments in the future.  We issue short term bans to get people's attention, works doesn't it?

Not as drama filled that way is it?  

[Here's the real conversation](http://imgur.com/eYeAUpL)

Note the bit he left out at the end.

But by all means, don't let this interfere with your circlejerk and harassing messages. 




 I wonder if they know Ben and Jerry's in owned by the Unilever Corporation, a publicly owned Anglo-Dutch Company.

 Is there a way to re-title things to make it less of an issue?  We can't add anymore categories as we are at the character limit for the sidebar, so that's not an option.  

I created anthro as a separate sections because it tends to be more field work/lab work oriented than other fields in the social sciences, in particular Physical Anthro, which looks a lot like paleontology to the untrained observer.  Cultural Anthro and linguistics, sure, they could slot right into soc without issue.  

And honestly, from my experiences, aren't all anthropology people just functional alcoholics?  Would they even notice? :-D 




 We love all of our children equally.

 Is that closer to rheology or tribiology? 

(Like I said, I'm not the one who knows about this stuff, and it's the difference of slightly different orange backgrounds on flair, anthro used to be in soc, so there are probably anthro people with soc css classes.) 




 Our resident anthropologists tell us that Linguistics is a subset of Anthro.

http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm

Social Anthro, Physical Anthro, Archaeology and Linguistics.

None of these are subsets of chemistry, so I don't have a knowledgeable opinion.

  




 Yup.  There isn't really an easy way to further break down the fields since people put their particular area, not a subfield in the text.  It would have to be done manually by someone familiar with the fields separating each out.  Some of them would be pretty hard to classify as well!  

For example, we have people with engineering degrees who work on computer programs to analyze biology.  So which field are they in? 




 It's under anthro, we follow the North American standard.

I'll see about working up more specific data later tonight, this is jsut css classes, so it's very broad. 




 You have env flair, environmental science, which is a green color, you must have the css turned off. 




 We think of it as community moderation, the rules are written as objectively as possible and enforced by a group capable of dealing with a default, as is the mod to subscriber ratio in 1/10,000!

A smaller group would burn out from too much work, this way no one person is critical, people can do as much as they want or as little. 




 Also amusing, flaired users/total subscribers

2769/8,260,948 (currently) = 0.0335% so a little over 3 hundredths of a percent. 




 Some go in health, other go in epidemiology, it depends on what the best fit is. 




 It's under bio.  It's the css flair class, not the flair text. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/science/about/moderators

/r/science actually has more mods that all of the other defaults combined, currently around 800. 




 That's some nice Excel work! 




 Publish or perish is quite the incentive, especially on a publication going to a small journal that few will read anyway.
