 I like Faxanadu! It's underrated but way better than side scrollers rpgs like Zelda 2 




 I've had my NES for years, but rarely buy any games for it anymore. I've played the classics (super mario trilogy, Castlevania, Bionic Commando, etc) but looking for some good games that are worth picking up that aren't as well known. 




 Has anyone seen the Criterion extended cut? I wanted to pick it up but heard mixed opinions.
