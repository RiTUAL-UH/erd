 Instead of the Catcher in the Rye read The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton. 




 Until I got to Reddit I had no idea that people saw images in their head when they read since I never have. Hasn't stopped me from getting wrapped up in books and being able to suspend disbelief when necessary. At the same time, yes, I dislike epic/high fantasy because there's so much description that does nothing for me -- it just drags down the pace of the story. I do like urban and comic fantasy because they tend to dispense with all that wordiness. I also read a variety of other genres. 




 It's mostly bestsellers and books people had to read in school, regardless of genre.  




 Try /r/literature then. 




 I'm not a Christian either and I can't defend why they decided that homosexuality is about the worst thing ever while bacon is a-ok. 




 It is the prayer for the sick! I'm impressed that they got it basically right. He said the word for "sick people" and not "sick person," but close enough! 




 This is not correct. The Bible gave signs for which mammals were allowed to be eaten and which weren't. They are: split hooves and chewing their cud. Pigs are singled out for special mention because they have split hooves but don't chew their cud. Three other animals are singled out for chewing their cud but not having split hooves but since they're not commonly eaten anyway, people tend to forget about them.

It has nothing to do with dirt or trichinosis.  




 Kegels can help. Yes, kegels for men. 




 What "pop culture" are you referring to? Pop singers are generally denigrated if they don't play instruments unless they have an amazing voice because of the (mistaken) perception that they're not really talented or not really artists. 




 Because every state has its own geography, culture, history, resources, industries, etc., so each state makes laws that suit its own needs.

 Because they tried Prohibition already and it was a disaster. It could be in the future once marijuana is fully legalized around the world they will start in on demonizing alcohol. 




 They are chemical reactions in our bodies which we interpret as emotions of one sort or another. For example, when you hug somebody and get a release of oxytocin, you interpret it as love. 




 When you fill your mouth with water there is no lack of oxygen. Swishing water around your mouth can help prevent tooth decay by washing away sugars or particles stuck between your teeth, but it can't kill germs. Only mouthwash can do that. 




 Still the same answer, honestly. Obviously it depends on your relationship, but I've had some funny (read: awkward) encounters with non-Orthodox coworkers on the subject of religion and it's left me gun shy.  




 "Happy holiday." 

It's a nice thought for you to be more specific, but I personally find it uncomfortable. Plus, if the person saying "happy holiday" has their own holiday around the same time, I can easily say back "Thanks, you too." 




 I look at tall beautiful blonde people and I think "I'm supposed to look like that." What's the difference between you and me? Otherkin look at animals and think "I'm supposed to look like that." What's the difference between you and them? 




 Funny, I was about to mention the third book in Follett's Century trilogy: Edge of Eternity. I will probably finish it this weekend, but it's such a slog. It's more like a trip through history than an actual story about real characters, like a more boring version of Forrest Gump.  




 Let him read Ivanhoe, then. Outlander is basically the 20th century version of Twilight. 




 "It was as black in the closet as old blood"

The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie by Alan Bradley.

Disappointing book, actually. I expected it to be delightful and it's not. 




 It's meant to be a throwback to the olden days before they were able to produce paper evenly. As sort of mentioned above, it's a stylistic choice, often used for literary fiction to imply that the book is somehow more "authentic." (Though if you Google it, plenty of crap gets deckle edging too. Sometimes it's just a publisher's *thing*.) 




 That's called deckle edge and it's totally normal. When I Googled what you said the title was, that's exactly how they described it. You got the book you ordered.

On the Road Paperback  Deckle Edge, June 1, 1999 




 On the top right-hand side of your phone. 




 He shouldn't be trying any of those things. He doesn't have a sleep disorder.

If this is the first time he's lived with someone, then he just needs time to adjust. It may take a while -- months even -- but a hotel room doesn't compare. Not only because it was probably for a relatively short amount of time, but also because it was not his own room and it was a disruption in his normal life routine, all of which can cause sleeping problems. 




 No need to make life difficult for yourself. Just because a book is considered to have literary merit doesn't mean it can't be short and/or easy to read. I'd go with ~~the Crucible,~~ A Separate Peace, and 1984.

Wait, you said it had to be a novel. Hamlet and Dante's Inferno aren't novels. 




  As for the bed thing, that's pretty easy....two twin beds pushed together lets you "share" a bed but pick the mattress that works best for both of you.

Or the sleep number bed where the two sides can be adjusted separately if the room is too small for two twin beds. 




 Apparently if you don't own a lot of books, they age you down, potentially by 20+ years, and vice versa: if you own a lot of books, they age you up. That question should be deleted, or at least weighted differently since no doubt a good many people, such as myself, get books from the library. Not to mention that owning a lot of books has nothing to do with your "taste" in books. 









 Not only do I do this, I try whatever it is the person is interested in, so I'll have more of a personal experience of what they're talking about. Even if I end up not liking it, at least I gave it a shot. And sometimes I do end up liking it so now we have a shared interest.

I have yet to meet anybody who would do this for me. And that's why I'm still single. 

Well, part of the reason. 




 The idea is that a drunk might be aware that they are drunk and take as much care as they can, be cautious.

Except this doesn't happen. The old saying is that if a person is weaving all over the road, they're drunk; if they're driving extra cautiously, they're stoned.

Distracted driving is not worse than drunk driving, in fact, it's better -- in the sense that you can choose to put down your phone but you cannot stop being drunk by choosing not to be drunk anymore. 




 In my experience, often enough to be noticeable.

For example, at work, I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting at my desk, the phone rings once and then hangs up, and whoever it was never makes any attempt to call or contact me again. So if I'm not at my desk when a call comes in and when I get back there's a "missed call" indication but they haven't left a message or sent me an e-mail, I'm going to assume they dialed my number by accident. 




 Just because someone dialed my number it doesn't necessarily mean they want to talk to me, or it doesn't necessarily mean they want to talk to me later. It could easily be a wrong number* or that they wanted to talk to me right then and there and if I'm not around, never mind, I don't need to call them back later. 

*Yes, even if it's someone you know. For example, I've dialed one friend when I meant to call another.  




 It feels really awkward to call someone for no reason, mostly because I can't stop thinking that the other person has better things to do and wants to get off the phone.

You need to trust that your friends want to talk to you. If they don't, then you might want to reconsider whether they're actually your friends or not.

I have friends that I talk to for two hours every week, I have friends I talk to for an hour a month. I chit-chat with my mother for about five minutes at a time multiple times a week sometimes. It entirely depends on what your schedule is, their schedule is, and what you have to say to each other. 

Lately I've found some of my conversations start awkwardly, like we're both being polite about letting the other person go first. I need to start being more assertive because one of my friends tends to monopolize the conversation if I let her go first.

The conversations end when it's time to go to bed or it's time to go do something such as putting the kids to bed or taking the cake out of the oven or switching over the laundry from the washing machine to the dryer. 




  I feel like I'm unable to multitask while holding a phone to my ear.

1. Don't multitask. If you're sitting in a restaurant with your friend you might both be eating, but you're not doing the laundry or walking the dog or sending out resumes. There's no reason why you should be multitasking just because you're sitting at home.

2. If you simply must multitask, get some kind of hands-free device or put the call on speakerphone. 




 Plus, only wear cotton underwear. 




 Not really correct. There were some well-known rich Jewish families and there were certainly some well-off Jewish communities, but overall, the majority of Jews throughout history were poor. 

This kind of conspiracy theory that OP is talking about really only goes back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was first published in 1903. Previous to that, the sort of conspiracy theories about Jews was that they were poisoning wells and using the blood of Christian children in their matzah, not that they were taking over the world.  




 The US-Mexico border isn't linear. A good chunk of it is the Rio Grande. Most US state borders aren't linear either. I only count ten states whose borders are precisely straight or nearly so. Even the US-Canada border is only straight for part of the way. 




 I'm not sure you could draw any better conclusions than we already do from studies and death certifications/autopsies. Without extensive information about a person's background and lifestyle, you couldn't control for confounding factors.  




 Baccano was better.  




 Where do you live, OP? Are owls common around there? 




 I haven't seen the movie yet but as I watched the trailer for Far From Men (with Viggo Mortensen), it felt like they literally gave away the entire movie.  









 "Take a Walk" by Passion Pit is sort of about that.  




 Theoretically I have no problem with people carrying guns but in reality I find that many people who want to carry them are more paranoid about their safety than reality warrants and they're looking to be heroes, which too often leads to unsafe practices such as not keeping their guns properly secured when children are around or by shooting first and asking questions later. 




 Most likely the state's health department, possibly also the CDC. 

But while it's an interesting idea, I'm not entirely sure that looking at people's medical records would really tell us much since they're not controlled studies. 




 Most likely they're very dry. Blinking a few times and creating tears should clear it up, if not, then artificial tears/saline should do the trick. 




 Stories aren't just intellectually engaging, they're also emotionally engaging. You care about a story you're reading. By and large you couldn't care less about the history you're studying.  




  Symptoms of food poisoning generally don't happen overnight

Generally they do. Some don't, but the most commons ones do. In fact, many of them show symptoms after only a few hours. 




 Never do this. Someone who isn't identifiable as Jewish is the same as a non-Jew, in terms of practical matters. 

For example, if I were in a theme park and I needed directions to the bathroom, it doesn't matter the religion of the person I ask; if I needed directions to the kosher food stand, then someone who isn't identifiably Jewish probably won't know. 




 This is only true for male versus female life expectancy and nothing really to do with any particular person. 

As has been said, men are more likely to have risky jobs. They are also more likely to engage in risky behavior and less likely to take care of their health, such as by going to the doctor when they have symptoms of a serious illness.  




 They most certainly will not tell you that. This only happens in the movies. The only time that staying conscious matters is if the person potentially has a concussion. 




 Cannot confirm. I live in NYC, work with plumbers, have gotten more gas calls in the past three days than in past three months. 




 And I feel like I've been an adult ever since I can remember and only now that I'm bordering middle age do I finally feel like I'm the right age.

At the same time, I like to pick up pennies, sing silly songs, watch cartoons, and go on Reddit. 

So, get off my lawn, OP! 




 Fear. Even if you that person isn't "the one," at least you have someone. If you leave them, you're afraid that you might not meet anyone ever again.  




 Murder is an infinite crime.  




 It's not legit in the sense that the DEAC is not considered an accrediting body for the purposes of claiming that a school is "accredited." 

If you're outside the US the UoP might be worth more because they say you can transfer the credits to NYU Abu Dhabi.  




 I never heard of it so I Googled. It's not accredited, so it's not entirely legit.  




 I speak French. It says: Do you want fries with that?

Strange sign to put on wires, but hey, that's the French for you, always promoting their own cuisine. 




 You're hanging out in the wrong threads? I see it all the time.

Though occasionally I do get the feeling that some Redditors are not used to defending their opinions and they back off awfully quickly when challenged, which can be boring.  




 Not quite.

Whether a particular type of bird flies south for the winter depends mainly on one thing: what type of food it eats.

In areas that have cold winters, some common bird foods, such as nectar and insects, may not be available year-round. Birds that eat those foods must fly south to find food to survive. Other birds that eat seeds or bugs that live under tree bark often hang around, since they can continue to find food all winter long.

 If they weren't Orthodox Jews/followers of the Shabbos, this tragedy would not have occurred.

This is false. 

Hot plates are commonly used items. 

They are safe to use.

They are not safe to misuse.

It is not a religious requirement to misuse a hot plate.

The tragedy occurred because of their misuse of the hot plate.

Of course I know what you're trying to say, and you're mistaken. The only way you'd be correct is if hot plates were inherently unsafe and Orthodox Jews insisted on using them anyway. This is clearly not the case. 




 No, we don't agree at all. If using a hot plate were unsafe then they wouldn't sell them.  




 I reread your post and I just want to make sure we are on the same page: you understand they left the hot plate on on purpose right? In order to avoid using electricity/flicking a switch on their religious holiday.

Which was completely unnecessary. In other words: not a religious requirement. Most people use timers to turn them on and off automatically. There's a guy in this thread who copped to leaving his hot plate on all Sabbath. You can ask him why he thinks it's safe despite the fact that we have proof that it isn't. And if he says "because their hot plate was malfunctioning and mine isn't," then he's clearly just as thoughtless as these people. Nobody knowingly uses a malfunctioning hot plate. In fact, I'm not sure there's anything he could say that wouldn't prove that he's being thoughtless.

Sorry for the idiot comment, it was out of line. it's just such a frustrating situation my emotions got the best of me.

Thanks. 




 As I said earlier in the thread, anybody who does that is doing so out of carelessness, not religion. There is absolutely no religious reason why they shouldn't use a timer so that it's only on when people are home and awake. 




 It doesn't have to be complex, it has to be compelling.  




 What religion do you blame when someone burns down their house when they used a flamethrower to try to kill a spider? When they fell asleep with a lit cigarette? When they used a stove to heat a cold apartment? You're the idiot if you think that religion is a more important factor here than carelessness. Orthodox Jews are not the only people in the world who use hot plates and are not the only ones who have fires caused by them. 




 This has nothing to do with "hardline Jewish Orthodoxy" and everything to do with thoughtlessness. Every time a person uses electricity or flames they should take utmost care -- and too many people don't. But most people get away with it.  




 Sadly, not everybody I know lives in NYC.  




 We will always enter and search to be sure that nobody was home, putting us at risk with their stupid decisions.

And I didn't know that. Will mention it next time the subject comes up.

Meanwhile it's not uncommon for bad fires to spread to neighboring houses

Not everybody lives in such close proximity to others so this isn't always applicable. 




 BDE.

Please do not leave your hot plate on all Shabbos, and do not leave it alone unattended, especially if you live in a house/building with multiple apartments or a single-family house that is in close proximity to other buildings/houses. 




 Nobody I know leaves a hot plate on the entire Sabbath. They use timers to turn them on and off. That said, I have told friends not to leave the house unattended if a hot plate is on. They ignored me, believing that these things only happen to other people. But I suppose the upside is that if the house burns down, at least there isn't anybody in it.  




 Friendship is the basis for a great many women's novels but obviously that's not what the author of this article cares about. And if he's looking for something more literary, there was last year's Friendship by Emily Gould. 




 The "things that don't need to be kosher for Pesach in the first place" is my favorite part. (Page 102) 




 Half a dozen, if not twice that. I couldn't put an exact number on it.  




 I hate that nobody seems to know what's going on. There doesn't seem to be any training regarding the library's features. Interlibrary loan? Only one person knows about it and she's not here right now. The fact that it says my digital loan hold is going to expire tomorrow despite the fact that I only placed it today? Can't explain it.

I also hate that shelf reading isn't done regularly and books that the catalogue says are there aren't really there. 




 I was considering visiting Denver this year (it didn't work out) but the first thing I did to plan for the trip was Google kosher food. Maybe I'll get there next year. 




 but they fucked up on checking in my books three times in a row.

How? My library has a book slot but after they managed to lose one of the books I tossed in there, I stopped using it. And after they once didn't acknowledge the fact that I paid a fine on a late item, I always made sure to get a receipt for proof. So one time something going wrong I can see, but three times? 




 What about this place?

 Library all the way. You have absolutely no need to feel guilty about getting books for free (by which I mean, paid for by your tax dollars).

 Not whispering, but they recently did a study where they paired cigarettes with a bad smell while people were sleeping and it did help them cut back on smoking, while pairing a bad smell with smoking while people were awake had no impact.

 Yes, you're right I ignored some parts of your post and I don't find your saying so abrasive, it's just that I'm caught up with this same thing with someone who's in the place of your coworker and it's so hard to have to basically just stand around and watch them suffer because of a bad decision they made 20 years ago and have been compounding ever since. 




 I don't know what your circumstances are or what your goals are, but your coworker is 100% correct that it's easier to go back to school when you're younger than when you're older, and if you wait to until you "know what you want to do," you might be waiting until you're dead because not everybody figures out what they want. Besides, going to college can help you figure out what you want because there's a variety of classes you wouldn't have an opportunity to take otherwise and professors and advisers that you wouldn't be able to interact with otherwise. 









 Unless you are talking about a specific person, how can you possibly give a more specific answer?  




 Not all US states have Powerball, so I'm genuinely surprised that Puerto Rico does (and apparently so do the US Virgin Islands!). That said, those idiots on Twitter are just that: Ignorant idiots. 

In the olden days idiots didn't have a worldwide platform to air their nonsense so the only people who knew they existed were their friends and relatives. Now that they can tweet to everyone, and reporters seem to think that looking on Twitter constitutes "news gathering," you're hearing these idiots' voices more and more. 




 Where have you ever seen predictions a month in advance? Most sites give 10 days out. The monthly "forecasts" are just averages for those dates. 




 Either they're lazy, they're jerks, they didn't grow up with these habits so they're not accustomed to them, or they're genuinely forgetful.

 But they have to make a point not to keep it fully.  









 It's forbidden for non-Jews to keep Shabbos. It doesn't matter how sincere they are about it, it's not allowed and presumably they would be punished for it.  




 Let's see. She has no sense of humor. She's some kind of sexist/homophobe. She doesn't know how to have an adult conversation. She tries to make you think that you're doing something wrong by being yourself.
