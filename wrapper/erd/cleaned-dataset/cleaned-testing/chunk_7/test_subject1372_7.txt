 Typical PC life span for mid to low end models is 1-3 years. All Macs are expected to perform well for 5 or more years. 




  other PCs have the same technical specs and reviews but at half the price.

If you want to take specs on paper and say well, these computers both have 2.0 Ghz with 2Gigs of ram and 200GB of data storage, then yes, you'd be right. But these aren't defining factors of how well a computer performs, especially when two different computers use two different operating systems.

Apple's operating system, upon being user friendly, having tons of productivity enhancing features, as well as multiple desktops which somehow still evades windows programmers, gets away with being able to accomplish the same things based on low-powered low-bloat open-source code. When you run windows on a Mac, you start to notice that the battery life drops since windows does require more power to run more often than not.

Having better specs on paper never guarantees better performance. When you look at the world of mobile phones, android phones just fucking *love* to tout that they have more Ghz or ram or cores than Apple's latest iPhone. But, you notice they still have basic issues such as scrolling not being quite as smooth as it looks in commercials, or their massive megapixel cameras not looking better by any margin than any other camera with 1 or 2 less megapixels.

Get reviews from power users, people who go on forums and debate these. Those are much more valuable than a user review left 2 days after they got it. When you're using a computer for just email and facebook, suddenly, any $300 crapper is going to be just what the doctor ordered and warrent a good review from the first two days.

But wait until there's issues with the computer. This is where Apple stands out. If you experience issues early on, it's confusing on who to go to for support. Best buy? Dell? Some different computer service? Microsoft? What if Dell and Best Buy say "It's a software problem, go to Microsoft", but Microsoft tries to pin it on Best Buy or Dell?

Apple is Apple is Apple. The computer, both hardware and software, came from one company, and THAT'S the company you go to. (Note: Yes, the hardware comes from multiple companies like intel or amd or nvidia, but Apple has sold the hardware to you and takes responsibility for the defects you may experience early on.) If it's under warrentee, Apple will be perfectly happy to fix the problem for you, or find a solution should the problem be a bit more of hassle than anticipated. Hell, they were even so nice to flat-out replace my iPhone 5s when it had an abundance of cracks and a bend that prevented it from working. (Another note, that's from my own stupidity and mishandling. Take care of your items, you should never have to deal with cracks.) 




 I'd be jumping at that if I had $600.

 I actually hate how unbearable iTune's UI has become. I really would prefer that they simply stop trying to change the experience and just give us that ducking sidebar and simple lists and artwork that only showed in a corner while a song was playing or when using cover flow.

 Oh, by far, the plot has its ups and downs just like any other show. MLP included. But the ups far outweigh the downs. I encourage you to continue on with it.

 It's amazing what some people consider super hype. This was on its moments near the end, but some part dragged for me. There was great back and forth on most matches, and hardly did a game end with the winner having more than 1 stock. But as it is, it's a bit over-hyped.

 To help your potential deal making, why don't you pick out some of the more notable cards and get a pic? 




 Oh my god. I look like Colin Mochrie 




 They really are desperate to keep their tyrannic choke hold on the necks and wallets of consumers. Seriously, saying "we can't change the new rules, so let's try to make sure nobody can enforce them" is basically saying "We know we're doing shit they wouldn't like and that consumers don't like, but we're hoping we can keep them stupid until we're retired with lots of their money in our pockets."

Fuck you Pai. Fuck you internet providers. Fuck everyone involved in letting the internet situation get as bad as it did. For fuck's sake, don't tell  us this bullshit how you need more money and tax cuts and that you can't innovate unless you're a fucking monopoly. There are service providers in other countries half as old as you are offering fiber speeds for dirt cheap compared to here and they're all doing just fine. And once the rest of America figures that out, they're gonna rip you a fucking new one. 




 "I'm not afraid of a machine gun. Are you kidding me?" 




 We are America, and so is Canada, but only we are considered American! 




 "I'm technically disease free" 




 So basically, the ISPs are mad that they have to follow rules now. They've basically been dodging monopoly lawsuits by 'competing' in only about 5% of existing US territory and failing to expand into any other territory where another ISP exists because the other ISP wouldn't let them use the same infrastructure.

The Internet providers are sueing for the privilege to charge content creators to get their data to us faster. They basically want to double dip american pockets and be allowed to offer us speeds lower than the maximum they're capable of. They really don't get the point. The point of the new rules is that anybody can use any equipment that is already built up so you can move in and compete with anybody else's service. It also states that you cannot offer priority to any content creators or double dip into america's pockets. 




 "Introducing Richard's Dick puffs! How many can fit in *your* mouth?" 




 "Colin Os. No hair in your cereal, guaranteed." 




 Bring on the fox players saying, "But it's not how melee did it." 




 This is pretty pathetic. The only reason it even changed is because of the outlier, Google Fiber. ISPs are still gouging our fucking eyes out just so we can download at 1/20th of the speed they're capable of offering (which wouldn't cost them any extra to let us have).

 You're not helping. You helped him make his account? So you know him in real life? Mods tread carefully around those who know each other in real life or claim to know each other as scammers have used duplicate accounts to try to vouch for themselves so that they can ruse others into unfair trades without getting their main account banned. This even goes for me and /u/lily247, which is why we both have verification that we're two separate people (on our feedback threads).

Please do not try to get involved in moderator affairs unless you have been asked to provide assistance. 




 I hope you're not useing the "average" or "highest' values, and that you're checking links to verify that Yugioh Prices wasn't making any errors. This is very much recommended. There is no way everything you have presented in the binder totals to more than $20 dollars. I have checked myself, I even have many of the same cards. They're all worth around $0.50. People don't buy for average price. 




 For the apps that aren't important or too frequently used, I do this. I leave Safari and Messages open. Sometimes even Vine. But things like the Guitar tuner, Whisper, Maps, I close those right when I leave the app until I'll need it again. 




 Please do not go through with this trade. This user has been reported to be fake and/or a scammer. 




 If you are not able to send immediately/next day, you should not be posting. 




 I hate to brake it to you, but the total price of the core is actually about $15. The entire binder combined has a value of about $25. You're really asking for too much. This drastic over-pricing will not be tolerated. You have a few hours to revise this listing. If it is not revised it will be removed, and your profile will be banned from all Yugioh subreddits. 




 Screen capture software? They probably have access to the videos, they edit them and export them optimized for vine, and they use something like vineclient. 




 I hope it will eventually be for sale for those who couldn't afford both versions.

 Set it to a resolution that has its height at 480 pixels. And if you can, play it in windowed mode, and only capture the window. In premiere, you'll be able to make a sequence with custom setting so the height and width is 480 pixels. Se the pixel aspect ratio to 1.0 so the true aspect ratio of the video is 1:1.

[This is what I'm using](http://i.imgur.com/e5sm7Ys.png). Preference options may vary depending on the version of premiere. I'm using CS4. 




 I'm actually very surprised about Skill Drain getting such a deep hit on the banlist. And, on behalf of my friend John, I'm saddened that the Dragon Rulers are really gone. He's been playing them since he could afford them. awe well, time for him to run Red-Eye Black Dragon. He's actually been trying to make a good Red-eyes Black Dragon deck for a while. That new support kind of makes up for it. 




 Vine doesn't support 60 FPS. You're probably just seeing a video that was shot and exported without frames blending together. 




 Don't capture in such a huge resolution. try recording originally at about 720x480. I know it sounds stupid, "Why wouldn't I record in HD". Trust me, the bigger you record, the more information you lose when downscaling which means the computer has to decide what to throw out, and it's not always a good decision.

And you're probably not seeing bad quality video. It's probably pretty damn good, but you're viewing it in a stretched resolution on your computer screen. Make sure you're viewing it at the original resolution.

Not to mention, I would never recommend Vegas Pro. I'd recommend Premiere if you can get your hands on it.

Check your pixel aspect ratio, make sure it's 1.0.

 Feel free to discuss things about the ban list. This can be what you want, what you think will happen, or joking about changes. This thread is to cut down on the amount of threads asking about the ban list.

**When will the ban list be out?**

Konami has not promised a reliable date for the ban list to be announced. For all we know, they're still playtesting to construct the new meta for April. There is no way of knowing exactly when it will be announced.

**Should I edit my deck when it comes out or wait until April 1st?**

That answer is up to you. Some players choose to edit as soon as possible to try to beat price spikes from cards that find a good fit in the new meta.

**Will [insert tournament here] be using the old or new banlist?**

This depends on a few factors. Who is holding it? When is it? Large sanctioned tournaments will always use the ban list that is in effect at that time, not the newest announced banlist. Some locals enforce new ban lists early, but this entire depends on who is making the decisions.

**Will [x card] be hit/nerfed/unbanned?**

We don't know

**What will be the top deck afterward?**

We don't know

**What cards should I get beforehand?**

We don't know. Hold off on purchases that try to predict the ban list. 




 For general purposes, there never is a reliable date for the new ban list. It comes out when it comes out.

 So, instead of building a new browser which would conform to the latest standards and strain for a high quality web browsing experience on par with Safari, Chrome, or Firefox, they're just going to rebrand it? And then still keep IE for some windows users? That's absurd. They should just kill it off and put a new browser on with a simple name. Perhaps *Super Highway*. I think that'd be a cool name for something that's supposed to access the information super highway.

But this really doesn't make me happy. Microsoft is too stubborn to just let Internet Explorer go because they have to have "compatibility". Internet Explorer already needed to jump through hoops to be compatible with the evolving and standardized web that it couldn't exactly keep up with.

 Wow. I love how everyone assumes I'm ignorant and start talking about how it's a market thing and not a technology thing. You alone aren't going to change the market. Nobody right now actually needs a battery that will last for 7 days without a charge. I doubt anybody's awake using their device for 7 days so that they couldn't plug it in when they're asleep. I can understand wanting an all-day battery life, but 7 days is pretty ridiculous.

The new macbook already has a logic board half the size of most laptops and uses the extra space for battery life. And they're trying to keep it thin and portable to be comfortable to carry and use. So if you want shit's battery to last longer, tell the corporations directly. Tell the engineer's. Don't tell reddit. Reddit can't do shit. 




 I seriously doubt it. Apple may be about standards but they still are about protection. And I don't want just anybody using just any low-watt or high-watt USB-C cable they find lying around and potentially ruining their phone's battery by using a mismatched charger.

What I do expect is, not too soon, that lightning's other end will be USB-C. 




 If you're running Dragon Rulers, you'd probably run Mythic Tree Dragon and Mythic Water Dragon. They can be searched with Tidal and Redox unlike Red-eyes which is a DARK and cannot be searched with any Dragon Ruler.

Mythic Tree and Water dragon synergize well with Tidal and Redox through their effect of special summoning and changing levels and even give the deck rank 8 options. Red-eyes does not. It's a normal monster that must be Normal (trubute) summoned (2 tributes) or SSed through a different card's effect, basically taking up deck room just to be able to SS Red-eyes.

And *my point* wasn't that the vanilla 2500 level 4 beater would obselete Red-eyes specifically 100% of the time. Of fucking course attribute and type play a factor. I was making an example. In decks that actually regularly use normal monsters, a 2500 beater at no tributes trumps just about any other option, especially options you need to tribute for that have fewer atk/def. By after a big play, who wouldn't want to just slap down a fucking 2500 beater for free no matter what type or attribute? 




 You should submit that idea to Apple and/or third party manufactures. If you could get someone to make that, Apple would likely have more people buying the new Macbook, and the manufacturer who makes it would be getting some happy business as well. 




 Okay, this guy has a good point, but it's not the point Apple sees in this device.

The new Macbook isn't designed for people who need a lot of ports. The new Macbook is designed for the most basic of users. It's designed for the grandmas and parents who *don't* have or use flashdrives to move things around. It's designed for people who *don't* use their computers for mass productivity. It's *not* for people who use more than just internet to check their daily feed every day. Macbook Air used to be the same way. The place I think they fucked up is the price point. It has less power than the Macbook air (I don't mean it's underpowered, it's not underpowered for its purpose), has fewer ports, isn't as portable, and they want $300 more for it.

Peoeple, shut the fuck up and stop complaining uselessly on the internet. If you really want one but don't think you'd be able to use it, FUCKING TELL APPLE. In case you haven't noticed, just about none of us can do anything about your bitch-ass boo-hoos over having only 1 port.

Apple's introducing a new product that's aimed to pave the way to get users to use fewer wires (be more confident and reliant on iCloud keeping files consistent across their devices), fewer discs, and it's pushing for new standards. It's an early product that *YOU DON'T NEED TO FUCKING BUY*. Early adopters will likely find many problems that the press will go fucking nuts over and trying to claim that Apple made a shit product based on the first batch. But that's what happens. You remember the retina Macbook Pros? They were extremely costly, sacrificed features for thinness and battery life, and had logic board problems when they first started rolling. Apple started ironing out those issues, and those who can actually use one and still be as fully productive as they were before are the ones getting it. The ones who need a thousand more ports just to be productive aren't the ones getting rMBPs and they're not going to be the ones getting the new Macbook. 




 When you make a battery that can do that, then be my guest and get it into these machines.

... Oh that's right. 




 I love your story. It's inspiring. Although, it could do without the "still out there" ending cliche. Just a thought. But, it's your story, and you tell it how you want it to be told. 




 "Haven't you people ever heard of  
Closing the goddamn door?" 




 I kind of feel this way too. Plus, I think USB-C just looks cooler than other USB devices. And it would bring USB ports to 2.0 or later right? No more getting USB 1.0 ports on a comp that you thought had USB 2.0 ports. (Yeah, It's happened to me a bit.)
