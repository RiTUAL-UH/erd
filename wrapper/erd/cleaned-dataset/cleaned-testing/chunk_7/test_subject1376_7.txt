 I've been freelancing for a number of years and I've found that it's a sales job mostly. By that I mean it is a numbers game.

The more people you offer your services to the better chance you have of picking up new clients. Half of my day consists of networking, giving presentations, free work for charities etc. Everything I can to sell my services. 

Price isn't an issue once I sell someone on the work I can do, though I don't sell anything based on price. I've found the clients that are extremely price conscious only care about that one thing, which results in the product and my sanity suffering. 




 Whoa I didn't know that, this does sound cool! 









 I went from a 27" desktop to a 13" retina MacBook and I haven't used the desktop since. I never thought the pixel dense smaller screen would be as capable as it has been. I even sold my cintiq and only use an intros now so I can work anywhere. Best thing I ever did.  









 If you are developing a marketing plan I'd love if you shared. It sounds like you've got a lot of experience. I've never had to do this sort of marketing so it would be interesting to read. 




 Maybe, depends on how you present it. This is a [pretty dapper group of human billboards](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/London_human_billboards_Scharf.jpg).

 I've heard good things about scribe, but I've never used it. I'll check out CAT thanks for the recommendation. 


































 Millenium Hand and Shrimp! 




 I love the color pallet! 









 I can never get enough of a good explosion!

 I hope you had some good audiobooks! 




 How do you learn to be a farmer for a summer?  




 Isolation can be difficult. 









 [Skyrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim) is a video game by Bethesda Softworks. [Mod](http://bit.ly/17ZhvIV) is a term used for a modification to a piece of software. You can think of [textures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping) as 2d images wrapped around a 3d shape. A [texture mod](http://static-6.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/2356-1-1329757130.jpg) would therefore be a modified texture in the game. [@jordandrako](http://www.reddit.com/user/jordandrako) is making a joke by pretending to think this isn't a photograph taken from real life, but instead a very high quality [texture mod]. 




 I use a pencil and paper first, then the final wireframes are built in uxpin. 




 I've played with appcooker and I enjoyed the little I used from it. I use pencil and paper for most of my prototypes, but I want to try all of these options now! 














 I gave up frivolous media (tv, movies, video games) on weekdays, not altogether I'm not a madman, in favor of non fiction books, art projects, and open source playing. It was something I did early last year and it's incredible how much I've grown in my personal and professional life because of it. 

That same thing also worked with bad foods substituted for healthy foods :) 




 Thanks for the rule link, and sorry about that!
