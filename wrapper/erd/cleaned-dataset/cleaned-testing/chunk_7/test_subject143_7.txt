 Potion sellah i'm going into battle and i want only your strongest potions. 




 That's probably information i should add, well anything between 20 - 30 per person for a full course, no preference really on cuisine. 




 Somewhere that has some good food and a nice calm atmosphere would be perfect any suggestions? Maybe a place to go out for a drink afterwards too.

Edit: Lots of suggestions guys i'll have to have a good look at all of them thank you to all of you! :-) 




 Yeah but if this happens the drop rates would probably go down even more, and we don't want that now do we, Rotomaniac? 




 Ah thanks, i thought so, would be nice if it did change the appearance. 




 Okay so i equipped my new sight through the modify menu but when i get in game my M1G has the original iron sight still attached? Are the sights just for stats or do they actually change? 




 I thought he meant the camera was in the clock, and the dad found out by seeing it was dirty taking it down and cleaning it, only to notice a camera in there, i watch too many movies... 




 My school had a bomb threat, one of the students phoned up and said they have placed a bomb somewhere in the school, everyone was evacuated onto the yard (Which was about 50 feet from the buildings, what good that would do) the police were then called and they had the canine unit searching the school for the bomb, they found nothing everything was fine i think they found the student and removed him from the school this was in the UK, all in all i didn't mind, i missed all my classes that day, thank you bomb kid... you're the bomb.

Found a link here if anyone is interested, i don't go to the school anymore. http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teenager-charged-over-broadgreen-international-3352147 




 Yeah I sent mine straight away as soon as I found out who my match was guess I'm just a little impatient and excited to see what I get! 




 I still haven't gotten anything :-( looks like tixx skipped my house this year. 




 Where did you get this information that they will cost 400 gems a piece?
 




 TittyAttack.com ... 




 I feel like this system could be easily abused, what if there was multiple scouts on one map by multiple i mean like 30, what if some player just likes making random markers at places for no actual reason, it is a tough issue to solve.

I was thinking something like the commander tag, but for scouts, the tag allows their text in map chat to show up in a different colour to the others, a scout tag, it would also allow people to see which towers have scouts, due to it showing up on the map much like the commander tag, not sure of the pricing of this tag tho, maybe 100g like the old commander tag? 




 Damn, I'm making those Oreo truffles later, thanks Kevin! (Who knew Asura were such good cooks) Amazing job guys! 




 I feel the elementals would be alot better if they were made permanently summoned until death then they go on cd, much like necros felsh golem, it would be sooooo much better, this along with the lesser elementals too. 




 You're right it doesn't feel like you're a plague cloud, probably the best way to do this would be to make the cloud much larger, the actual size of the aoe area, although this would make you a much larger target, it would still be very cool and feel alot more like an elite through a simple cosmetic change. 




 turns out it's a Sovereign - Victoria, Old Head and not a 5 hahah makes it alot easier for me to research now, thank you for your input really helped narrow my search i'm not good with coins. 




 Hey guys so my SO's parents have a bunch of these http://m.imgur.com/a/QyGJ2 I was just wondering if you guys could give me some info on how much they're worth today and who or where I should sell them to get the best price thank you! (If this is the wrong subreddit for this type of post please direct me). 




 Yeah I always check things for myself would never ignore something simply because it was down voted and thank you I didn't mean to accuse you of accusing me hahah. 




 Ah yeah I would never do that without first checking the link. 




 Don't have to worry about dungeons all classes are viable, while some may be better than others when it comes to damage or utility, you can be useful as any class if played right, so play what you enjoy, I had the same problem as you, I forced myself to level to 80 even though I was bored, can't say it wasn't worth it once I hit 80. 




 Thank you!
