 Happened to me in Witcher on console. I was kind of surprised because that hasn't happened to me in years. 




 FTFY: Moleman Arkham Knight 




 it just so happens that it has a separate bone there


Ay^y^^y^^^y^^^^y^^^^^y 




 Not with that attitude. 




 ruin the game


That ship set sail a while ago.

Edit: Downvote away, the truth hurts bitches!! 




 You played one mission yet you completed a 6th of the story unknowingly, I think that says it all. 




 Don't forget Bungies pockets are being lined with sweet cash as well. Don't think for a minute that Bungie doesn't know exactly what they are doing, they're not retarded. 




 It's not a game, it's a business model. 




 I think I got cancer in my eyes, can someone blow on them?? 




 Because the fundraiser wasn't successful at raising enough money to save the clock tower. It's scheduled for demolition.  




 Let them, hopefully they go bankrupt in the near future due to their poor decision making. 




 Not only that, a lot of people buy gameboys just to play Pokemon games. If they make it a console game they would lose out on so many gameboy sales.
 









 Aw man I missed the draw!! Congrats!! enjoy da moniez.

Edit: **Apparently you are unable to receive money through paypal** ...Just thought I'd make you aware! 




 Well hey there buddy, any chance of getting one of dem dere recommendations for the preview program?? 




 I've wanted 4 day weeks and 3 day weekend since I was about 13. Life is to love not to work. I really wish there was some way we could change it but it's delusional.  




 I'm guessing he's released another apology because Watchmojo made a list of top 10 reasons to hate Kanye a few days ago. 




 **AGAIN!** 




 Anywhere in Colorado. Mainly because I want to visit america, secondly legalization, thirdly Southpark. 




 I don't know a vegetarian, life is good. 




 I was re-watching the latest Top Gear season last night. It was the episode where they go to Australia and have to herd some cattle using their cars. The farm they were on was ***3.2million acres***. My "country" is 2.5 square miles (circa 1600 acres). You can fit my entire country 2000 times into that one single farm.


Australia is fucking massive. 




 Many places in the world. My local police force only carry batons. We do have armed officers at the airport, but that's it. 




 They could just make more.. (I don't want one or anything, just saying) 




 This demonstration is a few years old, just saying. Don't be fooled by the upload date on youtube. 




 I came here to assure myself I wasn't the only one. Thanks! 




 Motherfucker stole my moves! 




 Serioulsy how do you guys take pictures of random people?? I can't bring myself to do it, I feel like an idiot when I do. 




 The day someone actually makes a fully functional one of these things I'll be impressed, till then please don't waste our time and crush our hopes. 




 **NSFW** 




 Those are the ones that are available right now for preview members. More will be added in the very near future once Xbox can strike a deal with developers. Aslong as developers say yes we should be seeing fully capabale backwards compatibility with all games in the very near future. But before any of this happens we need Windows 10 on Xbox. So we're still a few months away. 




 You're looking at the wrong list buddy. The list you're referring to [Rare Replay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Replay). An Xbox one game which brings 30 classics back to life. 


Backwards compatibility will hopefully allow you to play any 360 game you own, natively on your Xbox one (provided that developers give Xbox their permission to use old games for free on the new system). 




 It made me buy a charger for my long forgotten Ipad. 




 I did them all...don't. Found maybe 1 sword I've kept, all the rest is lying at the bottom of the ocean floor beside the chests. Still it's nice to see you're map completely greyed out. 




 Picture of frisbee please OP. 




 That was better than I expected, they seem to have a really cool bro/sis relationship. 




 Ayyyy! 




 This, but let's make it another school just to be safe. 




 No he means like the French flag. 




 Next stop, The Pitchfork Emporium. CHOO CHOO!  




 I tried getting online yesterday, still not working. 




 That's a really cool way of putting it. I tired my hand at it once with a deck of cards. After a week I was still dropping cards everywhere, that was pretty much all the commitment I could muster.  




 17 hour work days?? *Poor* people. 




 I've read a bit into this before. Answer is as simple as practice makes perfect. In this case it is a tonne of practice, way more than I can even imagine to have the patience for. 
 




 Can I jump on your magical gold train?? 




 [MRW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mind_blown.gif) I read that. 









 You're a serial killer too?? What are the chances! We should totally live together. 




 Willikers you're right!...Gosh darn it, can't believe I didn't know that. 




 Do you want to be haunted by a ghost phone?


Cause that's how you get haunted by a ghost phone. 




 I think it's too late for that. 









 I had to get one 2 months after getting the console, it really is worth it. 




 The graphics are gorgeous. Just goes to show you don't need hyper realistic graphics to have a really good looking game. 




 God damn it, Now I'm going to have to stop by McD. I'm hungryy. 




 Fuck that, guests in my house is why I need my own controller. 




 Really? Xbox controllers are always built extremely well. A lot more durable than Sony as the evidence shows. 




 How many times is this joke going to be made?? I think this is the third time I've seen it near the front of /r/gaming. We know Yenns a whore ha, ha. 




 **SOME CONTENT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME, THANKS!**


^^^not ^^^all ^^^of ^^^us ^^^where ^^^able ^^^to ^^^watch ^^^E3 




 No exact date yet, it will be in Fall though [gaming season]. My guess is somewhere near the beginning of Fall so you can ready yourself for the plethora of new games which are going to be released. 




 I'm guessing it will be possible once we get the new OS. 




 I can only begin to imagine the barrage of request you must've gotten, good luck and thanks for doing this!! 




 I never made such a claim. 


Found the guy who pulls things out his ass. 




 Yeah, and now we can blame trickle down economics for it. 




 Found the rich stock broker.


Edit: it's a joke, calm down people. 




 I'm so glad I never got into it. Sorry for your wasted time. 




 I bought Monopoly and Risk on Xbox this past weekend. Amazing games to play with some friends. Only down side is no physical dice. If Hasbro could make some sort of mat and dice combination that would be awesome. Anyone want to start a kick-starter with me? 




 Baby girl's a Queen, 


But a Queen is just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves. 




 My gamer tag is ...



Please don't send me any more friend request haha


What were you expecting? lol. 




 ..and that's when mods become DLC. 




 Sounds like was destiny ~~is trying~~ failed to do.


 




 I came here to poke you guys with the proverbial stick and complain about how such an advanced piece of technology is being used on a build a block game. Then I saw the video, that's actually pretty impressive. Still don't see much use for it with real gaming but yea still pretty fucking awesome. 




 I never like these videos. They claim it's fast but never actually show it being fast. Whenever they are going through the UI they move once every few seconds. That's not how you're going to be using it. They did the same last time. 




 It's been happening for years, won't make a difference. 




 All I can think about is the amount of sick days I'm going to have to take later on this year. 




 This controller looks insane, seriously can't wait to get my hands on one. Great stuff this year! 




 Seriously what the hell do you guys do yo your controllers? I have 4 all working fine including the one that came with the xbox. No drift or anything. Do you perhaps leave them upside down from time to time? 




 They already make a solid controller for 49.99. So by that maths the new controller will be 3 times as solid. 




 On behalf of everyone in this sub: Thank you /u/MajorNelson and the Xbox team for what looks to be like an amazing year of gaming to come. Great stuff! 




 You're willing to give your only inch up?? Brave man. 




 That's amazing news!!


Thanks for the quick reply. 




 Awesome stuff, but what about physical copies?? All of my 360 games are discs. 




 "So where are we going today Snaps?"


"Not sure RC, wherever the current take us"


*banjo rift* 




 Took me a while to realise there were more pictures, it's a very slow sunday. 




 It looks like something straight out of MTV Cribs. 




 mother put the wrong date



You keep telling your sister that. 




 So do I, but with a gif you know you don't need to listen. 




 [MRW opening the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr8-WiJabBc) 




 Gifs = no sound, so I know I can enjoy it at work. 




 I agree the UI needs changing but that isn't the way to go about it. On console it would take you forever to get to your current gear as each tab take a second or 2 to load.


The best method would be drop down lists like they have on the bestiary, alchemy tabs etc. This way you can select the category you need without having to load everything else up on the way. It will give much easier access to your current equipment as you would only need to flick right once and you can add many categories without it looking like a cluster fuck. 


They were so close, yet so far. They had the idea just didn't implement it where needed.


Any ways that's my 2 cents. 




 Yeah I found out yesterday. As well COD zombies [the only reason I will be buying COD] will only be 2 player split screen. The 2 games I love to play coach co-op on with 4 players have been stripped away from me in one year. Assholes. 




 **LEGO GAMES** enough said! 




 Welp I know what I'm buying next. Love these lego games!  




 I just don't understand this credit thing tbh. Where I live you use what you have in the present, not use what you will have in the future. Credit cards are just weird to me and I don't understand why someone will willingly get a credit card knowing you will end up paying more for your purchases. 




 Why give mods so much gold? Don't the like have it for free anyway? 




 I need one of these for my house....then I need my friends to actually use it. 




 One of my mates fainted


Bravo, bravo. The icing on the cake. Girls screaming and this kids faints. 




 Sooooo where the girl in this story? 




 Throw the Jew down the well


^^^Throw ^^^the ^^^Jew ^^^down ^^^the ^^^well


So my country can be free


^^^So ^^^my ^^^country ^^^can ^^^be ^^^free 




 I know but it's worse if I don't provide a source, especially on Reddit. 




 Worst part is he wasn't even concious to enjoy the BJ, nightmare! 









 Fair enough, can't knock a guy down for hoping! 




 I would save every single time before diving into the water. Even with the Killer Whale potion it can all go horribly wrong extremely quickly. 




 *lowers pitchfork*


I hope you're right.. 




 TBH I hope I'm wrong and you're right. I'm just finding very difficult to trust EA lately. 




 Not the same thing really. That was giving you extra in-game money, this is giving you exclusive weapons that deal more damage. You could make 1,000,000 in GTA in a couple of hours, you will never use these weapons unless you get the pre-order bonus. It will kill the pvp especially since it's at launch, a few players will have better gear form the start because of this bullshit.


 




 The fact that people who pre-order will be getting weapons and equipment that deal extra damage on online matches. That's my problem, unbalanced pvp matches. 




 This is exactly the reason I posted this. I don't mind skins etc as DLC but when you're paying for better weapons it kills the online gaming experience. 














 This is just getting out of hand, and making jokes about it isn't going to help the situation. I'm not from America but it pains me to see that the "leading" country on this planet can't even get it's own police force under control. You're out waging war with half the world when you have fundamental problems in your own country that just get passed by and swept under the rug. Go to the streets get your voices heard, enough is enough.
