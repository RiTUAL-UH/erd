 Yes because I was horny and stressed and bored. I'm in a private cube anyway.  




 You're right. I'm a female and wouldn't go home with him. 




 I'm Italian so im hairy. I pluck my toe hair 




 Thanks. Where is he?? 




 Because they're formal but here to get their hands dirty. 




 Requiem for a dream. Can I just get high instead? 




 Try gofundme then post to /r/borrow /r/assistance and your Facebook 




 I'm not sacrificing anything for a job. I can't let it get in the way of life. 




 Stuck their dick in someone's eye 




 Yes. Just as annoying as your face. 




 Utopia 




 New England is expensive! 




 Yeah you should get on that. You should poop every day. Get yourself 2 bottles of magnesium oxide and clean yourself out! 




 You sound very passionate and angry about sneakers. You should try flip flops. 




 Never thought about it but I agree. Isn't their skiing though? 




 Read this whole thing as if you were talking about brownies. imagine my confusion. Never heard of this show though. 




 I'm no bro. But I am a 4. 




 Well well well this sounds fun. 




 Nostalgia 




 That looks like something that crumbles off my wall. 




 No because there are no leagues below me. 




 My desk 




 You're going to want to get her to a therapist. You have to do so in a way that's supportive and shows how important it is to better deal with this, to make things like watching a movie easier. It's not because she's crazy, but anyone that has went through this should have counseling. I suggest you go as well. I feel like her mom needs to know. But you can't be the one to say anything. If she was a good mom, she wouldn't let her daughter feel uncomfortable with the man together. 




 Don't go to a dealership. 




 I think you're a cop. 




 Yes. Why do you ask? 




 I think you should take the new job. I don't support jobs that make you miserable, but the only problem it seems are the hours. I think you can arrange a way to plan your activities. Plus, laying off workers isn't a good sign, even if they don't do it twice. Just my personal opinion based on what I would do. 




 Tattoo someone. Graffiti something on public display. Have children. Visit Sicily, India, south Africa. Take my baby cousin and aunt to Europe on my dinner. 




 Yes. Better than me. I was top of my class, honors classes, took review courses, blah blah blah. Did horrible on the SAT. I think for SUNY schools, 1200 and 1600 get you scholarships. Take a few practice exams and retake your junior year. You'll be good to go! 




 Nope but it's slightly better. Sorry you're going through this. I don't wish how I felt on even my worst enemy. 




 This past year. Depression, anxiety, no self control, friends, interest, job. Fucking up and ruining good things.  




 Get another job or hobby. Say yes to anything if someone asks you to do something. Hit this girl up again. Hook up with her, you'll feel better. 




 Yes and no. I used to be really shy and when they stopped talking, I felt like a loser. Like I couldn't keep their attention or they didn't like me because I was boring. I mean, they have every right to stop talking but it made me sad when we'd just sit in silence. If you grasp at straws long enough, I'll open up. 




 Ask about something they love. They'll talk more because they probably like sharing. At work, I picked the role as the weirdo so I could make people laugh and ask them questions like playing the favorites game. Seeing me get silly loosened them up. 




 Depression. 




 They spotted you. You're doomed. 




 When faced with an obstacle, you probably think to yourself, something has to get better and I'm not the one that can do it, yet. It's when you lose hope in yourself and need something from the universe. If I say something to god, I am thinking of energy. Something needs to align. God should be a broad term, not one guy in heaven casting spells.  




 Something about the climate I'd suppose. 




 No. Hollywood studios and an all star resort. When I was there a Chinese cast member from haunted mansion got hit by a car outside our apartment. 




 Huh? 




 Well for a guy, its tighter and the "taboo" feeling probably gets you intrigued. 

As a female, I kind of liked it. You know when you release a giant turd and for a second it feels amazing? That's how it kinda feels but for an extended time. I think I said this during anal sex and it was probably a mistake. 




 The blue or black dress. 




 Apples to apples and cards against humanity are definitely fun even when sober lol 




 Can you link me? Or I can send paypal 




 Idk talking about sexx 




 No. Because. Is taco a sandwich? 




 Disney world lol. 




 I feel the same. So I don't put up a picture. Id say post something where you're dressed decently, at some kind of party, and crop out anything bad. Or get a plain room with a dress shirt and take a photo with a timer. 




 I say soda because I worked at a place with a lot of international travel. I think it sounds better.  




 what state are you in? Marriott by chance? 




 Maybe want to visit /r/asexual 




 Cut the grass. Everyone here says pop. Upstate NY. 




 Looks amazing! Don't change a thing (for now). 




 I see what you mean, I'm just more interested in obstacle courses and adventure. Maybe I should just start hiking and making my own workouts at the park. 




 I don't really like working out. I prefer strength training to cardio. What I don't like is making everything seem like exercise. I was to do natural things to make myself stronger, toned, and thinner. Like moving boxes, tires, carrying things. I like when I had jobs that made me physical because it felt natural. What should I be looking for? Is it called something? Any ideas would be great. 




 Naturally or artificially? Carbs and grains are amazing. Quinoa, kamut, barley, oats. I like sugar free jello too.  




 Yeah but the fact that this guy came out of nowhere was nuts. Just like something off of long island medium. I couldn't believe it. 




 I'm writing this from my new phone that seems to be malfunctioning so forgive me if it's hard to read.

He said I would move to somewhere with palm trees soon. (I was moving to Florida the following week). Said I would get into trouble with someone named ****. And that this guy was talking to other people and that would get me in trouble. (Not sure on this one. I had met a drug dealer with the same name, a month later I was supposed to pick up and the day of our plans he got arrested, lost big money. Then later found another guy with same name --all within the same week-- as soon as he told me his name I called it quits because of what the psychic said. Could have put me in jail for a felony). Hmm what else, he said I'd have to make a big move in march and id be deciding between 3 places. It'd be a big decision but the decision I would make would be the best one (I did end up moving mid march because something bad happened. Was deciding between living in Florida, home, or with a relative.) Also, said I'm one to "cover my mouth" and not speak up. But I will and it will get me to a better place. Well, what happened during those rough months was due to me speaking up to my boss, which may have been bad to say but it turned out for the best.

Basically said I'd be okay and that I was kinda fucked up be okay. 




 A guy that looked homeless (lack of a better word) came up to me while I was with my friend at a coffee shop. We were there gossiping about who knows what, never saw him come in or sit down. Then told me he was a reader. Then proceeded to read me, tell me my future. Everything has come true, including dates and names. He was very modest, left abruptly, didn't even let me say thank you (I was like WTF, what do I even say to this guy? Made sure to keep a straight face and not really respond to what he said to lead him on). He left. Just disappeared. I have no idea if he had a car or just walked in to talk to me. Very strange but cool. I've been a mess this past year so I'm sure I have a lot of energy and emit some interesting waves.  




 People with art majors are the easiest to pick out. It's a different breed. I loved my time as an art major. People are amazing but I can't describe them in one particular way. Not hippies, just floaty. 




 Better yet, eat shit so you clean and fuel yourself at once. 




 Stolen money/gift cards. 




 I work at an extended stay as well. It's fun to make friends with guests compared to a regular hotel. 




 ChapStick. Pliers. An exfoliant. Coconut oil. A foot scrubber for dead skin. I'm a bit so girly girl but these are stereotypical female items that I actually use/need. 




 Car charger too
