 murder a baby

You mean zygote, blastocyst, embryo or foetus?

Baby would be intellectually dishonest surely. 




 Finished it two days ago, loved it! Definitely my favourite on the PS4 so far.

Just starting the 'Last Survivor - Ellen Ripley' add-on now, so atmospheric wandering around the 'set' of Alien and hearing Lambert scream at the start - chilling.

Not sure I've the nerve or stamina to try for the platinum. 




 It's not really NSFW, but I didn't want any chance the thumbnail would ruin the surprise. 









 This is handy!

Have they always been happening, haven't noticed a post like this before? 




 A fairly astonishing one considering the subject matter 




 Do you still think the UK and Ireland are the same thing? 




 here are some Irish sites

First up, blogs.telegraph.co.**uk**

tell me more about 'how i know nothing about Ireland'

I just have, but here are some more, children in Ireland are not taught anti-semetic or anti-Israel anything in any official sense.

That some schools take their own view, bear in mind your examples are based in very religious areas of Ireland, isn't right but then we don't check out schools every day with every teacher and I doubt any country does.

Though in my schooling, the very same system, we were given a very positive view of Israel and Israelis.

I still have a fantastic series of jewish artwork on my walls reprinted from a very old jewish calendar. My brother spent considerable time in kibbutz and is still in contact with people he met there.

I still can't believe you think a .uk is an Irish site, are you trolling yourself?

With regard to your sources, there are practically all blogs and opinion pieces. 




 Didn't think this was still a thing, except on inviable routes.

All the coaches I see around are private hires. 




 Probably since the bank guarantee, increasing unemployment   emmigration, increased taxes   levies but reduced services   provisions, the medical card fiascoes, tax-dodgers as TDs, debt-defaulters as Health Ministers, Garda corruption, cash for leniency in the courts, RT as government mouthpiece, a government with more strokes than horsepower, Savita, Irish Water, Migrant X, 300m discounts to Denis O'Brien, the Sherblock, Teacher - Pupil ratios, JobBridge, Paper Tiger Inquiries, TIME magazine covers, Patrick Neary, NYSE DO'B, pay-caps as lip service, Eamonn Gilmore, AIB, BOI, negative equity, Brian Purcell, unemployable yet unsackable civil servants, failure to employ thousands of laid-off construction workers in essential infrastructure projects, spin not substance, The World Cup with John Delaney, the Dil as it was as is it   always will be ...

So what piqued you enough to comment so briefly?  









 I'm still worried that the vote will be rigged. 









 Looks like Morgan Le Fey is letting him have this one. 




 Cheetah, kthxbai 




 Nah, I'll give the attractiveness to the dude.

On the flipside, the dude incurs the risk of 'did I ever tell you about the Cheetah' re-runs, and so creating the potential for widescale Kif-quakes in his well quiffed presence.

On 2nd t, you're probably right 

 




 Give [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) a try, it willl turn the pi into a network (SMB or NFS) / usb HD / stream music player.

There'll be no need to use the screen, as anything with a web browser (within wifi range) can control the music.

I love mine and so do the people I made two for :) 




 Have you checked on the Pi XBMC that under Settings  Services  UPnP all the UPnP options are checked?

You can also install XBMC on the PC   have the two XBMCs talk to each other that way.

Though NFS / Samba is the way to go if you can. 




 I'm really happy with it.

I didn't have to do anything 'exotic' with XBMC, yet have all the advantages of a central store and I created a home-server at the same time.

If this is your first Pi, be advised I've about 4 of them in active service, and am thinking of reasons to buy more :)

Though for the home-server itself I went with an Odroid U3. 




 Could you set up an NFS share on the main PC and then XBMC on all the RPIs can connect to that?

They would all be working off of the same store of PC data so can all be updated with one click or on auto whenever the PC data is changed.

It's how I do mine. 




 This [touch screen](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G140383714860) has me tempted at $120. 




 I'm using [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) with a [Wolfson DAC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi) that plugs into the Pi's board.

The sound is fantastic, and anything with a web browser can control it.

I'll be making a lot of them for friends and family. 




 "Previously unacknowledged Extraterrestrials quit Ireland for the OP8 system as long-standing ya-will/ah-no-shure custom fades"

Solar System Weekly, 2022. 




 You're a lovely poster :) 




 Yeap, it just went into my 'buy when in the bargain bin after the exclusive period ends' column.

I'm assuming it's a timed-exclusive, or SE have really lost their marbles.

Christmas 2015, there'll be a ton of other games to spend my money on.

 




 Has some violent moments in it, but I think it's extraordinary.

HBO are making a version of it soon apparently. 




 Utopia is the only tv show I can think of with this as a central concept. 





























 Oh if they can turn it into a baby-Matrix they'll be on to a winner, and I think they know it too. Plus they have the advantage of all that PS Home data.

Oculus, on the other hand, have Facebook data.

I guess time will tell which one brings in the heads. 




 I really enjoyed salt shooter and few others, but the 'queues' to play many of the games were ridiculous. 




 Project Morpheus   Playstation Home

 Ah, reform - there's no money in that apparently, hence Kerins et al.

Though, more seriously, your point about the courts is well taken.

If the pay, pensions etc. to people such as Kerins and Flanney were simply stopped - they would have to go to the courts to get satisfaction.

So in turn providing an opportunity to explain in front of a judge and the country why the government feels uncomfortable giving them any more money in light of their actions.

It is the public airing of these issues that makes K   F squirm - the government doesn't seem to scare them at all. 




 Because medical care is more important than the remuneration of two people who created a financial vehicle to enhance their salaries instead of the efficacy of the institution that employed them at a significant expense to the taxpayer? 




 Which is galling when Sony co-created DLNA 




 It will also send [$351 millions in aid to Israel's Iron Dome](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/americas/12837-us-congress-approves-351m-in-aid-to-israels-iron-dome)  




 The PDF describes much more nuance than that headline:

 Got a RaspberryPi with XBMC after the media-unfriendliness was announced - no regrets at all, especially as it was 30.

 Give [Lubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu) a try, it still has a GUI but is nice and light so shouldn't tax your old laptop much.

It should soften any learning curves before you go completely headless. 




 Yeah, kinda like the problem illustrated ... 




 Also, men don't understand: the toilet roll requirements, the psychological benefits of daily hygiene, 'bills are boomerangs' and clothes aren't really furniture.

On the flipside: noises are noises, hairpins are bathroom items, your hair is yours to clean-up, and preparation is no guarantee of success nor a panacea for calm.

 We're talking about a country that's thrived after two nuclear bombs - survived one of the biggest recorded earthquakes, then a tsunami and a nuclear plant meltdown in short order.

A Mount Fuji eruption could be devastating, and there's still no firm idea when that will happen.

Yet if there's any country that can manage such a disaster, it will be Japan.

Don't tell RT the signals are time-travelling, I'm trusting ye here now CD, I've just a few changes left to make and I'm all good. 




 Well they are that, and fairly fetching with the right legs.

Cost a fortune too.

There has been one murrrder by now, I take it. Not Mr. Lederhosen? 




 I'm watching Under the Dome and I want to climb into the tele and give at least half of them some brain-boosting vitamins. 




 Absolutely, but who likes commands without switches ;) 




 Cheers, there's one close by :)

And bloody hell, Gamestop are pricier than everyone else or is it just me? 




 You're only up to Brookside!? You've another decade and a bit to go so. 




 Repeats the last command you typed with 'sudo' at the start of it. 




 Ah, then my local xtravision (maybe chain-wide) is being a little cheeky / just emerging from financial-ruin.

Second-hand newish games are ~60, games like Killzone and Knack are ~30. 




 multi channel Pale

giggles (and so true, well 3 more channels including the red-triangle waving Channel 4)

Though as someone who spent time growing up in multi-cP and uni-cElsewhere, I reckon Breda fell between the stools of her mind. 




 Yeap, the very place (and my only local option). 




 Glad it's not a widespread thing, but I've no chance in my local.

I've asked, but the staff get that middle-distance look on their face and give a mumbled no. They look a bit too harried for me to pester them any further.

I'll just wait till the second-hands come down in price so. I'd like to try Watch_Dogs but at 75 new or 60 second-hand plus the current sentiment on the game it doesn't seem worth it.

 




 alias ffs='sudo `fc -n -l -1`' 









 All it was missing for me was the electricity power, I missed zooming along train-tracks and power-lines. 




 To be exact, the internet does nothing of the kind.

It's people who populate the echo chambers, exhibiting a behaviour that no internet law will really curtail and is prevalent everywhere.

After ~20 years of the web, we're still getting used to the audience our conversations and posts can have but we were always having these conversations.

Plus, unsavoury ideas are much better out in the open, where they can be seen and argued against. 




 Well there's an exception to every rule, and /b/ is the exception to quite a few of them.

As well as a worthy addition to a hosts.deny file of any concerned parent.

Nonetheless, if a kid is bullied on facebook and the like - they will get traced. IRL bullying is not so easy to verify or respond to. 




 It is indeed bigger, but that's not a problem either.

It's a great time for parents   kids to remind themselves that on-line fora / chat-boards are not reality and need to be taken with a pinch-of-salt.

Bullying is another matter, but one that is actually easier to solve in its on-line forms than its IRL forms. 




 The thing about group-think is that it can happen everywhere you have a group of people, on-line social networks are nothing new in that regard. 









 This part is also comical:

The internet may be socialising young people into near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening

And Rock Music will lead to Satanism, yadda yadda yadda ...

Nevermind taking it as an argument to remove religion from students' school education as **it may** create a near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening.

It's another missed opportunity from Breda to have a sensible debate or write a coherent piece on the variety of influences that are literally at everyone's fingertips, not only the school-aged.

All those column inches, to end with the stunning insight that parents should really parent. 









 That's great, thanks! 




 [Utopia](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/utopia/episode-guide) and only 8 episodes so far, couldn't stop watching it. And have already re-binged it.  




 I wish my local library did this, I feel Amazon has managed to privatise the library system without anyone really noticing.

How does your local library make ebooks 'expire' when the lending period is up?

 This is the same fool who thought [Irish MEPs should not complain about Hogan's nomination because "It is not done"](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/meps-should-not-be-bad-mouthing-hogan-says-ff-senator-1.1867542) - heaven forbid we might want someone better.

I thought the Seanad might up its game having come so close to non-existence, but it still looks like a carousel of curmudgeons. 









 A collapsed [pingo](http://basementgeographer.com/pingos-natures-earth-covered-ice-domes/) apparently.

 Sean Sherlock (L)  Moving to become MoS at the Department of Foreign Affairs with Special Responsibility for ODA, Trade Promotion and North South cooperation

Well at least he can't screw up Internet law any more.

It'll be interesting to see how his style of waffle is going to play out in this new role. 









 Which lends credence to the idea that it was never going to be just 2 or 3 concerts from the beginning, cheeky sod.

Well, he took a gamble and it failed or simply his bluff was called. 




 Useless.

I was in a minor fender-bender the other week, 3 distinctly different cars.

After 15 minutes getting everyone's tax details etc., the Senior Garda still didn't know which car belonged to who and accused one of the drivers of giving him incorrect info. Until it was pointed out to him that he was looking at the wrong car.

Never mind the Ban Garda sent out around the town on her own, got a coat thrown over her and beaten up. She was sent out on her own again a few weeks later.

A local thug who assaulted a Garda in the station yet is still free as a bird. Though there's also a laundry list of property damage and assault cases against him.

Utterly bloody useless.



 




 If they were hoping to damage US tech companies a bit more, I reckon they've succeeded. 




 Man, I'm not cynical enough. If he strung this out as a PR exercise he really is some piece of work.

I wonder what his cancellation insurance cover is going to be like, strikes me as the type that will put in a claim. 




 I'm only taking the blame for rainbows near vibrating columns of air.

They'll have to find other gay people for the rest. Though since heatwaves tend to lead to clothing removal, that one shouldn't be too hard.

 Which makes me wonder what the incentives were when he originally sold tickets for only two and then a total of three 




 But now he has disappointed more, and commercially has nothing to show for that. 




 And don't forget to think twice before signing up for Health Insurance here with an American company:

 Gawd? 




 Nice guy, instead of disappointing 2/5 of his fans - he disappointed all of them. 




 Thanks! 




 Is there a technical reason for USB v3 not appearing in this revision?

Would it fry the board or something like that? 




 Now there's a pre-order I won't feel conflicted about.

I wonder will it have a keyboard   mouse option?

 The pope has the power to remove any clergy from his church, anywhere.

A priest kicked out would have no home, no CV per se and quite likely little savings.

That's a threat that can summon many things. It's a threat that can keep things in the dark too.

So magical no, real very much so.
 




 My understanding on the ruling was that while the stats clearly show a gender difference, there is no certainty that 'all women' are better drivers than 'all men' - so applying a general trend to an individual case was unfair.

And like you've said - it's swings-and-roundabouts across the risks anyway.  




 I'd forgotten about the non-refusal  high-premium aspect to it all.

When I read 'tied-agent' all my investment product memories came flooding back, ahh I hated seeing some of the numbers there.

Churning investors and pensioners for so little to their own advantage, while looking at the numbers which circumscribed my salary and a salesperson's undeserving commission.

Don't miss that business an iota. 




 Aye, I'm thinking more of SteamOS where I can sandbox the snooping a fair bit more.

And it's not like SteamOS is a complete thing yet, but I'm guessing I'll have a greater control of it than Origin will let me.
