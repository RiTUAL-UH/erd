 Johnny is nothing more than the 21st QB since 99. He'll be gone soon 




 I'll do my best. 




 I'll own the hate I perpetrate. 




 Yeah, I was responding to ManChild goop gobbler saying it was posted already. I DO think he needs bad Manziel press shoved down his throat. I did not know it was posted already. 




 I'm from Kent. I love Cribbs so much you'd think it was /u/740Buckeye sucking off ManChild. 









 Not an intentional repost, but the link is broken. 




 I'm sure you are. 




 *Edit I didn't know, but out of everyone* You need to hear it twice. 




 Here's hopin'. 









 Fantasizing about two at once? Johnny acts like he has a small dick , I understand with a gaping wide ass like yours, that you would long for a good fucking from me. Well I'm gonna give it to you. I'm in process. 




 His cock is so far inside of you, I don't think you could disengage with a crowbar. Also, fuck ManChild. I'd rather have Weeded back just to spite you. Quinn 2015! Thigpen for life! 




 GTFO already. Your opinions are fine,  your delivery is bullshit and you have single handedly become the voice of fools on this sub.  




 GTFO 




 STFU and get out of this sub.  




 I wouldn't be surprised at all is your pussy ass can't take the type of bullshit you spew on this sub.  




 Here, I'll give it a try.  F-U-C-K M-A-N-Z-I-E-L A-N-D F-U-C-K Y-O-U Y-O-U M-A-N-Z-I-E-L D-I-C-K S-U-C-K-I-N-G F-A-N-B-O-Y W-H-O-R-E 




 This is the first thing you've said that I didn't have to decipher though a mouth full of ManChild dick and balls. I didn't even know you could talk without them in your mouth . 




 Here you go talking about busting. Im sure he busts on your face every night while you fantasize about him talking you to town from behind. Is it the alcohol content of his spooge that has you addicted?  




 You sure talk about ManChild and sucking ALOT. Freudian much, Gargle Balls McBuckeye? 




 Yeah,  and Manziel has run his crooked little pecker down the mouth of a /u/740Buckeye and the rest of the sub has to smell the cum breath he left you,  because you insist on wagging your cum soaked tongue all over this sub. 




 Welcome to your new life on reddit 




 If by half motivated you are talking about how his cock filled filed you up while he paid you to stick his dick all over this sub, I'd say is half hard motivation got you screaming his name in bed,  and by bed,  I mean this sub. Every post your cock sucker waggles about Manziel fills this sub wroth you Manny cum breath. Floss and pick a new topic.  




 Defending Manziel and gobbling his goop are two different things. You can't defend when your eyes are filled with tears and you have cum seeping out your nose. 




 Read the rest of my posts you baby fucking cock whore of a human being. Context is important. I want anything to happen that fucks you over and gets rid of Manny the jack fuck ass hat. I pray for Shaw to win strictly to prove you wrong.  I also now have a new reddit mission. Good luck.  




 I used to like him. Now I don't. You are the poster child for why I don't. He brings fools in his wake, and it's not good for the culture. This is a team,  he's an island. A loser of an island that can't get off my Browns fast enough. I pray that he does something so inappropriate in the off season that the front office has no choice but to fire him. Shaw takes the helm and  takes us to 3 super bowls. We only win one, but we beat Denver for the AFC title each time.  I also hope it makes you see how horrible he is. I also hope he goes to Oakland.  I also hope you have a dream tonight about having sex with your grandma. Sorry to be so vague about my feelings. 'Nite. 




 I can't wait until he's cut. Strictly because of you /u/740Buckeye. Fuck that guy, because fuck you, and no other reason. You have sucked all over this sub for weeks. Your fan boy outlook is the worst kind of fandom. You HAVE to be a better person in real life than you appear online. To quote John C. Reilly from Guardians of the Galaxy *"I don't believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am"*  




 I do, because it shows he really isn't thinking about anything but the moment he is in.  




 Because of what /u/Ihateloops said, below. It's a valid point. 




 He's a Brown. This is a Browns sub. Oh! We are supposed to not talk about him now that he has a negative spotlight  on him for his actions. 




 Today is a fine day to party. The season is over, but it proves he has no couth. 




 LOL. 









 I work at home! Wooooooo! 




 I like "In the style of Watership Down"  




 I am an hour and a half from Seattle.  I am so freaking jazzed. 




 Just moved to Seattle. Very excited.  




 I just moved to Seattle......Yiiiiisssssss. 




 That's the same play,  I think.  




 He looked like he got speared in the sternum. That would have had the ability to mess up his throwing arm.  




 I really think he got hurt on that sack by Houston. It coincides with his oddly drastic decline. 




 Or on his mobile phone.  




 Let's not give Manny a chance to change that. *EDIT: Hoyer has a winning record, boyo. Manny is a 2 time loser.* 




 He hasn't earned the right to not pay attention.  His actions all season have made him a target.  Thomas could live tweet the whole game and no one would bat an eye, because we know he gets it done on Sunday. We don't know that about JFF. All we know is he fucks off and loses games, so when he fucks off,  it makes us remember that he has been losing us games. And cussing beligerance from fan boys wont change that.  




 That's fair. 




 You Are A Ball Of Sunshine. 




 No downvote, but a boo for you, sir. 




 When a team plays like a Brown, they don't have a name. Once they score, they do have a name. His name was Jordan Cameron. 




 Aren't the steelers the bubble blowing babies that ran to the reddit admins (not even the Steelers admin, but the fucking reddit bosses) because of Browns fans going into your scummy ass sub and making these types of posts? You all act the same online as you do after a live game. If you win, you are insufferable, if you lose, you are entitled whiney bitch babies. If you bring this shit to our sub, don't expect us to keep quiet on yours. Treaty broken. 




 I've been on this train since the draft. Never had seen Johnny OR Shaw play. Watched their highlight reels and said "The moment this Shaw kid gets on the field for a team, he is never getting off until he retires. I bet Johnny and Hoyer both get taken out, and Shaw takes us to the Super Bowl" Well, some of that didn't come true, YET. But we will see. This is my "Johnny gets his start". I am PSYCHED! 




 I can't believe I have this many feels for a one year player. He has been so solid. Here's to him getting on as a coach somewhere in the Browns organization! 




 I am so fucking excited. So. Fucking. Excited. I have been a Shaw fan since the Draft and I called him ending the season. I hope he lights it up and wins a spot on the team, permenantly. 




 If her puss was dripping wet, and she ground it into your pants to the point that it made your cock wet, then it is theoretically possible, since it would have been body fluid contact on your genital skin, then yes. You could technically get it. More likely you got something from actually having sex, or a girlfriend cheating and then giving it to you. Either way, get tested. Reddit can't help you, a clinic can. Good luck. 




 That is amazing...... 




 This is the first I have heard of this,  as a fan living in Washington.  




 In sweatpants. 




 I love The Draw Play.  




 ruru22 




 He's my favorite coach we have had since 99, and I was pretty young for the pre-95 Browns, so he is pretty much my favorite coach we have ever had in my lifetime.  




 So, you would say that the single TD of the Season for Manziel wasnt a dangerous "take the hit" sort of drive where he got clobbered in the side? He was lucky that one didnt take him out. I dont think Johnny avoids contact. 
 




 He is going to keep getting beat up and hurt until he is physically unfit to get on the field. RGIII for example. I think Manziel was a panic pick, anyway. He might be worth a LOT in trade bait if we can stop him from getting chewed up and broken. 




 If Hoyer had been hurt and taken out, Manziel would have gotten an earlier shot. As it stands, Manziel is getting the same shot. He got hurt. shot's over till he's better. #ConnorShaw2015 




 Because he isnt fit for the NFL, and what's up with the name calling? Last bastion of a failed defense.  




 More than Johnny has. 




 You heard me. I said reap it. 




 So not Manziel, then? 




 Hoyer has scored more points as a backup in his two games on the bench than Manziel has.  




 You're just part of the very problem that you are railing against.  You might be THE POSTER CHILD for that which you attack in this post. This proves the old adage: *When you point a finger you have 3 pointing back at you* Be the change you wish to see. When you make that change in your self you will see it mirror in your world. We only see the bad in others that we see in ourselves, and you kinda exemplify that with this thread. 




 This is why a winning season is now a losing season
 Annoying because I'm not blinded by the first glimpse of hope. We shouldn't be happy with an "okay" quarterback, because an "okay" quarterback is going to cost us games by doing stupid shit like throwing balls into the chest of a defender and throwing into triple coverage...teams know that Hoyer has accuracy issues, and they load the box and FORCE us to attempt to air it out...
 




 I think you're just getting the same reaction to your Manziel ultra fanboydom that you spewed all over the Hoyer fans. You are part if the crap ass fan base that called for the head of a 7-6 season. You sewed this shit. You reap it.  




 Oh, no you're  not.  You say things like
 I'm not sucking Manziel's dick, I'm just saying that Hoyer has the mobility of a 450lb hamplanet confined to a wheelchair.
also known as a steelers fan



 




 You a Hoyer fan, bro? 









 I am sure that is true. I am sure a good number of the "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT JOHNNY?!" folks are also. 




 I think maybe we are missing each other due to each of our definition of "calling for his head". I remember the throngs of folks making fun of others because "You don't draft a QB at 22  and then run a perennial backup" and the throngs of all caps posts about just that subject, we're pretty vitriolic.  




 Miked1be, you are a moderator. You see all of this. You know that people have been calling for Hoyer's head since before the draft. 




 We don't know that. 




 Down voting this isn't fair to you,  but boo  sir. Boo to you. 




 I'm not rooting for either of them,  anymore.  I'm rooting for the Browns as a whole, however that may look. Shaw, Hoyer, Manziel, Mariota, mother fuckin' Jay Cutler, a walk on who I don't know and have never heard of. We aren't a cult of personality, we are a team. So I'm rooting for my team.  




 He is getting the same support IN THIS REDDIT *Edit: While losing* that Hoyer got.  




 Just giving him the same consideration Hoyer got.

 So envious. My secret Santa hasn't shipped anything yet, but asked if I liked Batman. Nothing on my list says anything about liking Batman. I filled out the whole profile, and not one mention of DC comics, anywhere. Good job on the  bad ass gift.  




 Delicious black magic! 




 No. Homemade. Delicious. 




 I'm making some of those, tomorrow! 




 Totally already has the cheddar! It was delicious.  




 But my woman making me homemade chili spaghetti while I live in WA and can't get Midwestern food to save my life? Delicious.

 What a nice new Lock Screen image file my phone.  Thank you!  




 From what I heard, it started after little man asked if mom was dating /u/ColdOfWinter. That could be enough. 




 To be fair,  they only said it sounded like a SIMS character.  Not that it was a SIMS character.  I guess that's where my confusion lies.  




 It could very well be a poltergeist created by the eldest boy. 




 Sometimes the two overlap.  




 Maybe it's cat just died? 




 I would like some new style to our uniform,  but I want Seal Brown,  (are we Burnt) Orange and White. Please no grey. Just....please. But some style changes and some composition changes.  I'm okay with that.  




 Austin is a team player and a class act.

 Agreed. *Edit: We Bark Together* 




 This seems most likely. 




 Bums aren't 11-6. If you can't be nice, you can at least be quiet. 




 Good looking out! *Edit: I always assumed the two industries  (auto and lubricant ) worked together, but autonomously, and that the auto industry wouldn't care what detergents and additives you used, in the same way that Lucas doesn't tell you that for best results use a Ford engine. TIL.* 




 I've always found my oil to be cleaner when I change it when I use Lucas.  




 I know. I know. 




 I give them to someone else.  




 I play this song by Prozac: I'm a Bastard 




 The front office said they will  probably draft a QB every year, and that they will field the people that give us the best chance. I truly think if this office thought Mariota would do the job, they would pull the trigget. 




 I guessed the real question you want answered would be "Why do humans get repulsed at the smell of a rotting corpse?" 




 To attract the things that will eat and dispose of it. 




 Lucas oil additive. It really works.  




 Mariota is Farmers guy. *shrug* 




 Just heard what was going on, today.  The source is what blows my mind. The first I have seen of any of this was in an article about how Uber was over charging people  to get out of Sydney.  




 Trade up for Mariota, and trade Johnny to Dallas for a second round pick.  Bring on the Down Votes!  




 With no tv, and only the Internet, nothing. *Washington State, United States*
