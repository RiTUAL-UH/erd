 He is such a good writer. 




 I don't want to discourage you, but unemployment is still really high here and pay is low for a lot of jobs.  You didn't mention what type of job you are interested in.  If you could apply for some jobs, come out on a vacation and interview.  If you get hired, move! 




 Voc-Rehab located in the Job Connect offices should be able to help.  Opportunity Village may have an employment program also although I'm not sure.  I worked at Catholic Charities at one time, and a coworker was in a wheelchair.  You can pretty much do any office job; it's just finding the right employer. 




 I don't think the article mentioned people were going without water to save pensions.  Pensions and health care are getting cut also.  I wish Obama could bail them out. 




 I believe the headline is correct.  The arguments supporting it however would not influence republican beliefs. 




 By the way, I would love Cheney to expound on his quote.   I'm curious about where he developed the thought on this.  I wonder if deficits do matter??  Other than that, he is about the sleaziest elected official I have ever seen. 




 Other than the Bootlegger, I didn't know or recognize any of the other locations shown.  I felt that this was a town I didn't know! 




 But he is right! 




 I have a friend who started with $250 selling vapes at a flea market.  He now has four stores. 




 What is Richard Mellon Scaife doing today?  Is he still living?  It's wierd that the Koch brothers have seemed to take his place. 




 Yes.  She seems to go on forever.....

 Why only for emergencies? 




 I think that is the base income. Everyone earning more than that wouldn't receive anything. 




 Let's get rid of those pesky unionized public employees. 









 It's true.  Can you believe it???? 




 Wasn't  Delta employee-owned at one point? Whatever happened with that? 









 I had just finished the book "Dog Whistle Politics" and it definitely had an effect on how I view the world. I started looking at all issues through this lens and it is amazing how I can see connections I didn't see previously. 




 Agree.
 




 They call themselves independents so they don't have to accept Bush as one of their own. 




 Drives me crazy.  They have to be getting it from their parents. 




 Gives me hope.  




 I agree with you there.  I don't know alot about Soros (and his business dealings), but when I've seen him on tv, he appears to be rational and thoughtful, two traits that I like. 




 I thought the light bulb and the phonograph. 




 Edison invented the light bulb and the phonograph.  He supported direct current (DC) for distribution while his ex-employee Tesla wanted alternate current (AC), a far better system.  Edison was more successful in his lobbying efforts. 




 Sorry.  I don't know what DAE means,  I just think we would have been better off following Tesla rather than Edison. 




 Actually, some studies now show that postponing instant gratification is a major step to escaping poverty.  I think they are talking about getting a high school diploma rather than dropping out. 




 I think this is what we hoped Obama would be. 




 The absurdity of it all.  But drugs are not the answer either. 




 What can we do?  They don't even realize they are voting to cut their own  medicare and social security. 




 Maybe Edison.  




 Trash Flash or Dirt Alert. 









 There should be huge voter registration drives in those states. 




 Why does this not surprise me?
 




 When I was young, I remember seeing photos of the match posted in Goldfield. 









 I think everyone needs the same pieces as you do.  Last time they ran this contest, NO one in Nevada won anything. 




 Didn't Ralph Nader say that only the rich can save us? 




 I think the County has jobs for students.  Henderson Parks and Recreation has jobs for students, so maybe the rest of the public entities (LV, NLV, etc.) probably do also.  If you were 18 and had a WSI (Water Safety Instructor) license, you could probably get hired as a lifeguard by the hotels.  Finally, I would google the Workforce Investment Program in Las Vegas. They have several agencies that have been funded to help youth find employment. 




 My husband's uncle told him when he was young that he would never see social security.  He is receiving it today. 




 You will be grateful for these programs when you turn 65.  I also object to them being called Ponzi schemes.  Ponzi schemes run out of investers which is what causes them to go under.  If we kept the money in a locked box, there would be plenty to go around.  We have a bulge in the number of people using the program during the boomer years, but this was expected and won't last.  The boomers also paid 110% of what was going to be needed!! 




 Might be cheaper than refinishing. 




 It was a shock to me, but young whites voted for Romney. 




 I heard George Soros say the same thing basically before GW won his second term.  He said if GW won, there was something wrong with us.  He is right.  There is.
Drives me crazy.   




 Sounds great to me.  I need more recipes, 




 I work with a woman who believes this, and she will not call herself a republican.  She is an independent.  I would guess she has never not voted republican. 




 I loved it when he made reference to February 30th. 




 Hitler did want to be an artist, didn't he? 




 Have you met with anyone at Job Connect?  They do have a Veteran's representative at their offices.  I know there has been a push to get veteran's employed, but I'm not sure which groups have been promoting employment through job fairs, etc.  The Job Connect office might know.  Good luck. 




 They may have more money than governments now. 




 I think it is still common in certain parts of Utah and Arizona. 









 Thank you for posting this overview.  I'm on many email groups and I get emails every other day to save SS.  I didn't have an overview however and this article put things in perspective.  I wondered many times if Obama was playing chess with the republicans, offering up these (and medicare cuts) knowing the republicans wouldn't take up anything he offered, or if he really believed in cutting.  In any case, it makes me nervous. 




 Try getting  job in Las Vegas hotel in advertising.  Maybe the Hilton would be good, then you might be able to transfer  anywhere else in the world. A master's would be good too.  UNLV, while not a great college, does offer a master's in hotel mgmt.  You could specialize in public relations or something. 




 Don't you love em? 




 Except for the strange vote in Ohio. 




 You answered with exactly what I was going to say. 




 The problem is that they are doing it at the local level now.  The exectutive branch is almost moot at this point.  That's why midterm elections are so important. 




 Didn't Perot win about 25% of the vote.  I liked Anderson too, but Perot would have been a horrible president. 




 Reagan was not popular when he left office.  The right has spent millions of dollars to rehabilitate his image. 




 Thank you for that.  I just finished reading "Dog-Whistle Politics" and I was shocked to learn that Romney won the white youth vote.  If youth are more progressive, it may be due to ethnic demographic changes.  You give me hope, because I've been watching these things for a lot of time, and I believe you are right. 




 Decades ago now, PBS aired a simulation (?) of the Chicago 7 trial using actual transcripts. I never forgot it. 









 Absolutely.  It's also been called the Two Santa Theory.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski 




 There was also discussion that they didn't want to pay off bonds before they were due. 




 I don't consider Paul a libertarian.  He is also anti-choice. 









 If you have 5-7 friends you play with, try Diplomacy.  Puts Risk to shame.  No dice, no luck in the game. 




 Yes, let's have war and an economy crash again. 




 Unfortunately they are right.  They have effectively stopped anything from happening at the national level.  Now, everything is happening at the state level.  It's just the wrong things. 




 If you think he's bad, wait ....  And if George Bush wasn't enough, you can't believe what Cruz would do. 




 And you can't discuss anything with them reasonably.  I've been there. 




 Most Tea Party members are the Religious Right.  They just rear their ugly heads every decade or so. 




 What a great experience. 




 They forgot to attend the hearing? 




 Good article.  The article should have pointed out the racial makeup of the Tea Party and the Republican Party for that matter.  It is 90 % white.  I think they put every minority they have out front to show that they are inclusive.  LOL.   




 Also, the Tea Party is a resurgence of the John Birch Society. I think that the Koch brothers' father was co-founder of the John Birch Society.  




 You could contract out to hospitals, HMOs or insurance companies for home visits for high risk patients that keep getting admitted, for assessments, review of medications, etc.  You could lower costs, and clients could have a greater health outcome. 




 When I was young, I remember the 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, which looks a whole lot less boring than your drive.  There was a billboard by the road that simply said "Ain't this monotonous?"  I wish I had a photo of that billboard today. 




 

















White Americans have not voted for a Democratic President since LBJ who said he was afraid he had lost the Democratic vote for a generation when he signed the Civil Rights Act.  Source: Dog Whistle Politics

Sorry for not finding the exact statistics to back it up, but it's in the book.



 




 Good link.
 




 Unfortunately, I think your right.  In the real world, we could show them the light, then register them to vote. 









 Tax breaks for the rich.  http://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/04/why-we-cant-go-back-to-sky-high-1950s-tax-rates/
It was 91% back then.  People were still rich, but there was a smaller gap.   




 I also agree. 




 I agree. 




 Poverty may cause crime; We do need to fix the problem (and I'm sorry for your experience), but cutting food stamps will only exacerbate the problem. 




 I know people from big families (not polygamist), and I'm amazed at how they do it.  Hard work too! 




 I hope you read my response to another comment in this same link.   




 Actually, I think that "Dog Whistle Politics" stated that 96% of Romney's vote came from the white population.  In terms of membership, Yahoo says whites make up 90% of all Republicans.  
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080619075211AAEZsTi
"Dog Whistle Politics" did say that Romney won the white vote of every age group which surprised me.  I thought youth had become more liberal.

"Dog Whistle.." also reported that the Democrats have not won the white vote for President since 1964 since LBJ was elected.  You may know that when he signed the Civil Rights Act, he predicted that he may have lost the south for the Dems for a generation.

This caused Republicans to develop the Southern Strategy under Nixon. Two Republicans former chairs have apologized for that strategy:

Ken Melman, former chair apologizing for the party using the race card: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html

Michael Steel, former GOP chair apologizing for the party's use of the Southern Strategy:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/22/michael-steele-for-decade_n_547702.html

You know, I'm white and don't like to hear this either, but sometimes the truth is painful.  I really recommend this book. C-Span had an interview with the book's author.  You can watch an interview at: http://booktv.org/search.aspx?For=dog%20whistle%20politics

I calling someone a liar is not the best way to disagree.  
 




 He's right.  The Republican Party is 96% white, and the white population is diminishing as a proportion of the population.  Two former Chairs of the Republican Party have apologized for the party using the race card.  The party is fundamentally flawed.  I just finished reading "Dog Whistle Politics" and recommmend it for people who want to understand it.  Rand Paul is not a libertarian either.  He has some issues that he sounds great on, but then there are other issues.... 




 Why else?  They are stopping everyone else from tackling every other issue.  I don't think that's ignorant. 




 The Republican Party is 96% white.  I tend to think that is what drives their agenda, which would make it the most important issue that we face. 




 I wish they would all vote. 




 I wish I could give you solid facts to back me up, although I feel sure I am right.  I think that was the main reason of having an estate tax - so money wouldn't just accumulate in some families. 




 I agree with you.  Rand Paul is a perfect example. 




 It would be nice to have a Democratic President who wasn't pressured by the right for a change. 




 I bet these states had the most white voters also.  I'm reading "Dog Whistle Politics" now, and 96% of Romney voter's were white.  60% of white voters voted for Romney.  It's ugly. 




 Me too.
 




 How can you financially support a family that size? 




 They have no ethics. 




 Another caseworker here too.  You are so right.   




 What are THEY trying to accomplish?  Give a buddy a contract.  Humiliate poor people.  They suck. 




 There are libertarian liberals also. 




 I think they have turned in to a cult. 




 There needed to be an increase in food stamps due to what they have done policy wise to the public.  They have made them poor!  Also, cutting food stamps doesn't reduce poverty, it just would make life more difficult for those struggling to get by.  I just don't get republican's logic. 




 Let them.  I don't shop there anyway. 




 Too tired. 




 If the Democratic Party was smart, they would be have a voter registration project of all those folks that would be eligible in states not accepting medicaid. 




 The GOP has a strange coalition of libertarians, Christians and corporates.  




 Thanks for your words of support and guidance. Valuable insight. 




 Not soon enough.
 




 I think eventually all money will naturally flow to the richest leaving everyone else with nothing. 




 Well, the Wal-mart heirs have 40% of all income. 




 It is supposed to be majority rule, minority rights.  In this case, the minority (republicans) are stopping the majority from ruling altogether.
















 




 We're not broke.  It's just that all our money is ending up in a few hands. 




 I bought a book on how the songs came about which I loved.  If I had the time to look it up, I would. Think you can find it online. 




 Is that why Fox started a new program called "The Independents?" LOL. 




 We are. I think the largest solar plant in the U.S. is being built in the Mohave Desert (Ivanpah?) 




 You could start your own reddit, but great choices. 




 Yes, and the party that claims to support the constitution doesn't address that it is the only agency specifically mentioned in the consitution. 




 He also won a World War, freed Europe, and guided us through the Great Depression.  That being said, I do think the camps were horrible.  I'm curious too, who would your favorite president be? 




 A coworker's son works for an airlines.  He gets free flights and goes everywhere on standby.  He also can give free flights to family members and even friends.   




 Not at all. 




 At one time, taxes were 94 percent I believe. It was an incentive to earn more for a bigger take home amount. I do think this is excessive, but with the Walton's, it would still be millions. 




 Name one president who did everything perfectly. 




 I love it. 




 Utilities are making it difficult for consumers.  I thought I would look at starting a coop in my state - Nevada - perfect for solar.  It would be illegal for a consumer-sponsored coop. 




 I was shocked at the NRA's reponse to Newtown.  I thought maybe working together we could come up with something like background checks that everyone could support.  Nope, the NRA's answer was more guns in the schools.   




 I could understand banning cigarettes, but I don't understand the banning of e-cigs at all.  Someone help me here. 




 It helped, but the over-leverage of the banks were the main cause. 




 Don't have time to look for it now, but NPR did a story on it recently. 




 Since I just paid $30 for one of my three windshield wipers, and I'll have to replace it in two years, good.
 




 I loved Love (the cirque show) so much I went twice in one week. 




 Some right-wing think tank probably bought them all and will give them away.  I've heard of them doing this. 




 It's 11 pm and I just ordered two. 




 Rick Santorum considers Mandala's fight like the Republican's battle against Obamacare.  Unbelievable.

 




 I watched a documentary of a young couple who built one and was shocked at how expensive it was.  I think it cost them $30,000 which seems like a lot for the square footage. 




 Wait til you get 65 and see how much you want to go to work everyday.  Plan to have your kids support you? 




 Boomers actually paid 110%, more than they should, to get through this period. 




 My husband's uncle told him the same thing when he was young.  He is collecting it today after 50 yrs of hard work.
