 A good, sound investment! 




 Thank you :D 




 We were able to get permission to circumnavigate the globe after our deployment with the Navy. The rest of the Strike Group went back home through the Pacific and we continued up through the Suez and into the Med. 




 That's fantastic! Where abouts in Utah? Mostly just curious as I'll be driving through there in the near future. 




 I drank the whole bottle which is one dose (10 oz / ~296mL) 




 I've used it a couple of times. The first time, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was light headed, dizzy and just drained. The second time, I kept hydrated, made sure to eat and just take it easy. I went through quite a few diapers that day. But, even the following few days, my body was not happy and I was passing everything in an unpleasant fashion. If you're looking for loss of control, it's great. I held it until my body just noped and forced the mess into my diaper. Just remember to stay hydrated and eat. And also be prepared for a rough couple of days after as your body adjusts.

7/10 would recommend but very very sparingly. 




 Yay! 




 I love your surveys! Plz can I haz moar? 









 I do believe they are!  









 lol :D 




 It's one of those little things most people don't know until you're dealing with it in a professional setting. I wouldn't worry too much about the title as the point is still conveyed :) 




 This will probably get me downvoted, but when a ship strikes a stationary object, it's an allision. A collision is between two moving vessels. As someone who's dealt with this type of thing before (albeit not on this scale), the Coast Guard makes the distinction. And then both vessels get to deal with the Coast Guard's paperwork! Fun! Nothing like an investigation! 




 I've got a few ships from this transit! I'll keep an eye out for the banner! 














 I love this photo with the house in the foreground and the mountains in the back. It just feels... right.

 I picked this one up in Alameda (back when our homeport was there :) ) 




 I've considered retiring to there. 




 Glad to offer bits of knowledge! And that is a good joke. Another is "Why must you be 6 feet tall to join the Coast Guard? So when the boat sinks you can walk back to shore." .

The one ship I was on had a flight deck and a hangar and we ran helo ops for almost every patrol. 




 For me, I've been sober for 3 years now, so it's not something I've been trying to hard to look into. I do remember loving the discovery of the Hefeweizen. 




 This was taken with a little Fujifilm digital camera. It's one I picked up at the Exchange before deployment which is also, now at the bottom of the ocean. 




 Fun fact in that I can answer both!

I was part of the Burial at Sea crew on the USCGC Munro during my tour. There were typically 4 crew members for the honor guard. The CO presided over the Ceremony with the XO acting as his assistant. Mostly the XO held the urn until it was time to hand it to the CO. That and get coated in ash that one time the wind changed direction. It was always a somber occasion and it's lead me to consider burial at sea as my choice of burial.

As for the interdictions, any USCG vessel (small boat included) can perform them. We derive our general Law Enforcement authority from 14 U.S.C. 2. [Here's the Office of Law Enforcement's Webpage.](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg531/) Additional US Codes give further authorities. As a Petty Officer, I had the ability to act as a Law Enforcement Officer (as per [14 U.S. Code  89](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/89)). As long as the vessel is flying the Coast Guard Ensign, it has the full authority of the US Coast Guard behind it. Fun fact! When you hear about a US Navy ship making a drug bust, there's a high probability that a US Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) on board and the ship will shift it's TACON (Tactical Control) to the US Coast Guard. This is because the US Navy doesn't have the same authorities as the USCG. On the other hand the USCG becomes a part of the Department of the Navy during times of war. 




 Wow. Instead of bitching, there's always voat. 




 The immensity of it all is staggering 




 Oh gosh. This photo was taken back in 2003. All I really remember from that time was a lot of sea sickness.
