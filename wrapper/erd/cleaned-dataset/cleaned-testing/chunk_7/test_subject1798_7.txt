 I sear then oven. I think it's less likely you'll overshoot your steak temperature that way. 




 Living in a desert, I'm always interested in saving water and energy so I wanted to see if the cold pan method of cooking pasta would yield good results. I first learned about it from Chow.com, [here.](http://www.chow.com/food-news/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan/) 

The danger of not using enough water is, of course, sticky pasta so for my first attempt I used whole wheat pasta which has less starch to begin with. I made one serving (3 oz. dry pasta) and used an 8" skillet. I broke the pasta to make sure it fit, which I don't mind. Purists may balk. I added enough water to cover it with a healthy amount to account for absorption and loss to vapor. It was probably around 3 cups (350 mL ?). 

It got to boiling pretty fast. [Here is a photo](http://i.imgur.com/s7H1WdL.jpg) of it cooking. I stopped short of al dente by a couple of minutes to drain and reserve the pasta water. I added my marinara and finished cooking, re-adding pasta water as necessary. 

The results were damn good. The sauce was thick and clingy and the pasta didn't stick. [Here's the finished dish](http://i.imgur.com/3TXfoUw.jpg) with some grated parmigiana and basil.

Edit:  In case anyone was curious, I ended up tossing away less than 2/3rd cup of water. 




 The Windows 10 computer icon looks like an iMac? 




 Not really. Look at Google's design guidelines. Metro and Windows 8 began to popularize the flat design, with little use of gradients. Jony Ive took iOS in that direction. There are so many devices now. Apple's UI and Google's guidelines emphasize a very clean look with minimal distractions that work well across a lot of different screen sizes and resolutions. To me, the Windows 10 iconography stays within those design principles. 




 I'm a pretty liberal Democrat and I find this title incredibly misleading. Reducing corporate taxes does not necessarily translate to increased wealth for the top 1%. 




 Landrover's [Valentine's Day Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRuD0mWDds). Very clever concept, and it is a true story. 









 What's this "reading" you speak of? 




 I work on the 6th floor of a building overlooking Main Street of my city. I was looking out the window one day and saw a dude driving down the street slowly with a hand down in his pants. I thought "No. Oh hell no."

I wish to God that I can un-remember that day.

 I thought you had to be buried in cement in the U.S.? Or is this not the U.S.? 




 I'm not a historian but by the 18th century, humans have spent a lot of time on the water with paper, quill and ink. I would imagine that they had dryboxes. 




 Did you just say 'stroke victim?' How does one get victimized by stroking? 




 Point taken. 




 I tried to be factual in the title. 




 I read elsewhere that he also had no prior criminal history whatsoever. 




 Here's a story of an expat who was beaten to death by customs officers for not paying the bribe.

*At Dhaka airport there is a gang of police and customs officers who supplement their pounds 80-a-month salaries by demanding between pounds 30 and pounds 50 from returning expatriates.*

*The general consensus, supported by a leaked CID crime report, is that Mr Miah was murdered, almost certainly by being beaten to death.*

*Humayen R Choudhury, the parliamentary speaker, doubted that the vast feudal pyramid of corruption could be breached, saying: "I know that people are treated very badly at Dhaka Airport, and we want to change that, but I imagine that you will come up against a brick wall when you want to talk to customs officers."*

[The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/death-at-the-airport-exposes-web-of-corruption-in-bangladesh-1308111.html)

In a country like that, anything can be accomplished at the right price. 




 AND a $1,000 fine. 




 *Sales of gold have long been an important source of funds for the North Korean regime, which has been largely cut off from the global financial system by sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear-weapons program.*

*Kim Kwang-Jin, a former banker for the Pyongyang regime, said North Korea could have been moving the precious metal in an effort to find buyers.*

*North Korea often uses diplomats to carry cash and other valuables, defectors and diplomats say. Increased sanctions and scrutiny of official bank accounts have increased the need for secret movement of items in this way, they say.*

Will there be anything else? 









 I would guess that PayPal, Apple, Softcard, Google and all the soft wallet services are also under trade restrictions. Besides, running a $1 Million transaction, while possible, might raise some eyebrows and draw scrutiny. 




 Oh hell no. The customs agent wants to see Benjamin Franklin, the most liquid piece of paper in the world. 




 I ask because tonight when I sat down the server asked if we wanted appetizers. I hadn't had a chance to look over the menu yet but I asked her "do you have a meat   cheese plate?"

"Yes!" she said.

"OK, we'll have that."

She brings two plates. One with the charcuterie, one with the cheese. In my continuing nave-ness I thought "hmm, why two plates," but didn't say anything. I realized when I got the bill that the meat   cheese plate was a meat plate and a cheese plate. $20 each.

It was delicious though. 









 $1.4M is not really that much gold at todays prices. This guy was probably a courier for one or two high ranking government leaders and was just going to trade it for cash. Because of economic sanctions, North Korea has very little foreign cash. You need cash--like U.S. Dollars--to buy/import foreign goods. There are people who will sell you anything--Mercedes, Fendi purses (popular with the first lady), Armani suits--but they won't take the North Korean Won.

The reason why he got caught is because he didn't make any bribes or didn't bribe the right people at the airport. Arguing diplomatic immunity won't get you anywhere but if you slip enough money into your passport you could get almost anything through customs in a 3rd world country. 




 There are two kinds of girls who go to the gym. One kind goes there to be admired. The other kind goes there to work out in peace. Neither will give you their number.  




 As somebody who has lost a mom, I have some suggestions. This would have worked well for me but I don't know your friend so keep that in mind.

I had to take care of the arrangements. That took a lot of time so I wish somebody just helped take care of little stuff. Water the plants, walk the dog, etc. Keep your eyes out for that kind of stuff and offer.

Be honest. You can't imagine how it feels if it hasn't happened to you and it's OK to just say "I can't possibly imagine what you're going through." Any sentence that starts with "I wish" isn't going to be all that helpful.

It's a sad time but it's also OK to smile, laugh and even joke--"Your mom would not approve of that shirt for her funeral." Sometimes dark humor helps crack the tension. Again, you know your friend, I don't. 




 I'm guessing the reason why you're agonizing over pennies is because of what your parents did during your upbringing. In between the lines I think you sense that as well. One thing I've learned from my own therapy is that family of origin baggage is heavy.

Treat yourself to one or two brand name things every grocery trip and increase that as you feel comfortable with the fact that it really doesn't make a shits worth of difference at the end of the day. 




 Apparently I put it in the glove compartment and it flipped over the top and fell behind the compartment when I shut it. The glove compartment was probably too full of shit but still, a crappy Chevy Astrovan design. The guy had taken out the center console to do some work in there and found my wallet. 




 I did, just not there. 




 People had insane topiary gardens. 




 It's just data. What we make of it is purely our own invention. The data is just data. 

If instead of circles they were bombs or tanks then the illustration would have been perhaps too politicized. But as it is, it's a just a standard way of depicting relative values and, to me, unworthy of being called "beautiful." 









 They have to monetize for the investors or else the founders will get the boot. 









 Thanks! 




 It also means that the officer has at least reasonable suspicion which allows him/her to ask more questions to determine probable cause. 




 Good advice. I just want to add that if you are actually being detained on reasonable suspicion or probable cause, you can state to the officer that you have an attorney. At that point they are supposed to end questioning until your attorney is present. 




 Unless you are being detained, the only thing you are required to give police is your name and any identification if they ask for it. You can refuse to answer any other questions and a refusal will never be used as any evidence of guilt in court. But you should always do so in a courteous manner or else you may give the police something to arrest you for.

That said, keep in mind that cops are just trying to do their jobs. Yes, I have heard the horror stories of some pretty big assholes in uniform too. But the vast majority just want to keep things under control. Sometimes they are responding to citizen calls about suspicious activity and they want to make sure that you're legit. They would probably appreciate clearing you quickly so they can move on to trying to find the actual person the caller was complaining about.

Even if you think the cop is overstepping his authority, you should comply but clearly state that you object to having to do it. The court will not allow any evidence gathered from an illegal search if it ever gets that far. 




 You have a good point. I was so entranced by his movies I wasn't thinking. 




 Kind of like Vince Vaughn? I think it would work pretty well actually. 




 I think OP is thinking fried spring rolls. That's the term most used in trendier restaurants and vietnamese or thai restaurants because "egg roll" is too associated with crappy Americanized Chinese restaurants.

To answer OP's question:  Fresh spring rolls are made from softened rice paper, has fresh veggie ingredients and pre-cooked meats inside (shrimp or pork usually). Fresh spring rolls are not fried. On the other hand, fried spring rolls is ground meat and vegetables rolled in a special spring roll paper that fries up crispy and deep fried. A chinese egg roll -- I'm talking the crappy restaurant kind -- is usually some kind of meatless cabbage filling inside the same fried spring roll wrap, and it's deep fried as well. 




 They want to tap into your impulse buying habit. They don't want you to think which your mind can't do as well when it's trying to process the auctioneer. It's also a way to increase the speed and thereby increase the pressure on you. 




 The chemical structure of the different plastics isn't anything that nature has ever made so there are no organisms that consume it or can break it down and it doesn't rust or dissolve. Plastics, theoretically, last forever under normal circumstances and they never get recycled back into nature. Personally, I think we will eventually see the evolution of micro-organisms that can feed on plastics. It may take a million years though.

Petroleum itself isn't bad. It's the byproducts of combustion that is bad. CO2 in the atmosphere soaks heat instead of allowing it to dissipate into space, causing the Earth's surface temperatures to rise and altering the climate. Particulates like soot get into our lungs and are carcinogenic. 




 A reasonable doubt is when you're not convinced because there are other possible explanations that the prosecution could not effectively dismiss.

A trial generally goes like this:  The prosecutor has a theory and they show evidence to support that theory. Time lines, weapons, blood stains on the defendant, eyewitness testimony, etc. The defense attorney tries to introduce "reasonable doubt" about the most critical pieces of evidence. The defense doesn't have to come up with a competing theory though ideally it would be helpful if they could. The defense attorney will try to show that perhaps the eyewitness was too far away for a positive identification, or that the time line would be too difficult to accomplish. Basically, anything to have a majority of the jurors say "hmmm, maybe he didn't do it." 




 You're being rational. Knock it off. 




 I love how his opponent just rubs his hands together in glee after making the counter move. 




 I'm not putting any blame on the municipalities, and I get what you're saying. I think they would benefit from more education of their community of the effects of trying to grind everything in the sink disposer. The rice in the photo is a perfect example of stuff that should have and very easily could have gone into the garbage bin. 




 All you have to do is go up to a cop, kick him in the balls and yell "Don't tase me Bro!!" 




 It would only be used to catch bad guys. I promise (wink). 




 Municipalities should do a better job of teaching homeowners. The solids that goes into your sink just gets filtered out and taken to the landfill anyways. Homeowners can save themselves potential problems and also be friendlier to their sewage treatment if they just scrape their leftovers into the trash instead of the garbage disposal.

I haven't had a garburator in 15 years and haven't had any clog problems. 




 There are a lot of people who will take a story like this, fill it in with fictitious stuff they've seen on CSI, and think that a processing a rape kit will somehow magically deliver incriminating and irrefutable evidence of guilt. 

All I can say is:  Keep fighting ignorance. 




 Can I get the plans for that for my 3D printer? 




 Maybe she was cold but if somebody is so frail that they can let a single sentence push them to suicide then I think the problem isn't with the girl. 




 Unmatched DNA doesn't go into any database so this just isn't going to happen, at least not today. It would be an interesting database to have though. 









 Besides the storage issue which has already been covered, the other difference is that video is being processed at N frames per second whereas a camera (even a smartphone) can afford up to a couple of seconds to process and store a single image. The processing power of the security camera or the DVR affects the resolution and quality of the image. 




 I agree with that 100%. The issue I have is that people are demanding that *all* rape kits get processed. That's needless yet that happened recently in Salt Lake City. The city council and police department caved to the political pressure. Money/time/resources will be needlessly wasted. 




 You let the dough sit and rise to allow the yeast work its magic. The yeast is converting the carbohydrates into carbon dioxide which will gives the bread its bubbles when it bakes. The rise will also give bread a different, less floury flavor. 




 In a case where the assailant is not known by the victim then it can lead to a match in a database. It's worthwhile in those circumstances and detectives will almost certainly order processing of the kit. But if the detective already knows who the accused is and they don't dispute that they had sex with the victim, why process the kit? The latter is the majority of rape cases.

For wrongful convictions the defendant can always ask for processing and they can also employ an independent lab to process it. 




 Most of the time it doesn't because the accused are known by the victim and there isn't any dispute that sexual intercourse took place. It comes down to consent/non-consent and processing a rape kit does not help resolve this dispute in any way whatsoever. 




 In most cases, the accused is known by the victim. Processing a rape kit isn't needed if the guy admits to having sex with the victim. The rape kit can only help resolve who the rapist was if the assailant is unknown or the accused disputes having sexual contact. It doesn't help in he said/she said cases and is just a waste of resources.

(Edited to clarify wording.) 




 Backlog aside, as a cop (I assume you actually mean detective since cops police and detectives investigate), tell me what goes into the decision to request rape kit processing vs. not requesting it. 




 Why? Serious question here. 




 My cop bro went through it at the academy. In his video they're all laughing. You can't help it. But he said it's a good lesson, exactly for the reasons Jashinist said below. He said he never wants to go through that again. 




 Shit, that's bad reddit form on my part. I gotta get it off his phone...  




 Damn, that sucks. 




 My bro is a cop and he had to go through this at the academy. His video is fucking hilarious. 




 Synthetic oil is not actually synthesized. It has its base in crude oil from the ground, just like conventional oil. It just has been refined to a more pure product.

Edit: Adding an [explanation](https://mobiloil.com/en/article/car-maintenance/learn-about-motor-oil-facts/synthetic-oil-vs-conventional-oil) from Mobil. 




 For a quick primer, listen to [this podcast](http://backstoryradio.org/shows/body-politics-a-history-of-health-care/) from Backstory With the American History Guys. They are 3 professors of American history and they talk about how the whole idea of health insurance got started, how it evolved to be employer-based in the U.S. (you would never guess) and why it's different than the European model. 




 Yeah the COBRA law was a step in the right direction, as long as you could maintain your coverage. If you let it lapse then you got screwed. If you just lost your job and your prospects are pretty dim, wouldn't you understand it if somebody decided to let their health insurance lapse in order to keep their mortgage and house a few more months? 




 Yes, that's right. 




 But you'd still have to pay the premiums for that gap year, of course. 




 What hospitals are cutting budgets? Other than VA hospitals, I actually haven't ever heard of that. 




 I'm a self-employed 45 year old and I pay $450 per month for health   dental for just myself. It's an 80/20 plan (I pay 20%) with a $2000 deductible. It's a "Camry" plan. 




 [Top grossing for-profit hospitals](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists/50-top-grossing-for-profit-hospitals-2014.html) in the U.S.

Some hospitals are [corporations with shareholders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Corporation_of_America). Others are non-profit. At non-profit University of Pittsburgh Hospital, the CEO makes $6 Million a year.

[Why non-profit hospitals are the most profitable hospitals in the U.S.](http://www.arbiternews.com/2014/04/08/why-nonprofits-are-the-most-profitable-hospitals-in-the-us/) 




 I had one medical bill that was only partially paid due to a insurance screw up and it was on my credit report. I only found out about 5 years later (I don't apply for loans very often). I saw it on the report and called the collection agency to find out what it was. They told me who it originally was with (for some lab tests, if I recall). Funny thing is that after I called them, they started calling me and pestering me to pay the bill. I told them that I had insurance at the time and told them to take it up with them. This went on for months. 




 And prior to the ACA law ("Obamacare") your chronic condition could prevent you from even getting insurance. Cancer survivors in remission were frequently turned down if/when they lost their job and their group insurance. And if you had a chronic medical problem and a potential employer found out, it does sometimes affect their decision whether to hire you because it will raise their insurance costs. This is especially true for small companies whose premiums can jump wildly if you get one or two employees who are big health care users. 




 Hospitals also use this to maintain their tax-exempt status. Tax exempt hospitals "donate" about 1% to 2% of their services. They say "donate" but most of it is just uncollectible debt. But it's apparently enough to allow them to not have to pay taxes on their profits. 




 If you had absolutely zero assets then maybe you won't have to pay. But if you had a house, maybe a little bit of savings, all of that could get wiped out since your bills would be sent to collections who would start legal proceedings on that debt. The only you'll have going for you is that debtors prisons have been outlawed.

In the UK you will get prescribed painkillers and post-surgical rehab treatment that helps you recover faster, makes sure you can get around your house or apartment, and stuff like walkers and shower chairs in case you have trouble standing up or walking. In the US if you don't have insurance you have to pay full price for your drugs, any needed equipment and people to help you rehab so you can get back to work.

The US is a totally backward barbarian society. But we're not the only ones. There's Rwanda, Uganda, El Salvador.... 




 I remember reading a long time ago about a Japanese guy who was unlucky enough to be caught in both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki detonations, very close to ground zero. After recovering he lived a long life with apparently not much side effect. I'll see if I can find a link....

Edit:  [Tsutomu Yamaguchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Yamaguchi) lived a relatively healthy life and died in 2010 at the age of 93 from stomach cancer.
