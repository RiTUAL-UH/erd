 This assumes that demand stays the same even though labor wages is demand. 




 Keep in mind, Japan is automating their labor force. Wages is demand. 




 Some Businesses will shut down because demand has fallen. 




 It is very team based and hard work for low reward of a goal or even a TIE according those people  




 Any sports that rewards players for receiving an excessive force/battle/combat will have floppers. 




 hockey is a very expensive sport for people to play. 




 No. it is those big government Democrats and Obama, who want to keep the Patriot Act and NSA intact. 

Because you know... GOP is for freedom and limited government.

Vote for Jeb Bush! ;) 




 Somehow the NSA and Patriot Act is more important than Environmental Issues and Climate Change.  




 Wanted to repeal the 1964 Civil Rights Act at one time.

Wanted to deregulate the EPA

Wanted to disarm the FDA 




 What are you talking about? 




 Outsourcing is good for the economy because we can focus on service and high-tech jobs. Then, we need to automate those as well. :) 




 It should be obvious by now that big businesses are the only ones who truly have the access to world markets.  









 then we should outsource the entire service industry to machines.  




 If the entire labor source is gone, then demand should should also be gone.  




 To have full comparative advantage, we should outsource the entire manufacturing industry overseas. 




 How will the U.S. Control the most important economic regions if trade enables all countries to mutually cooperate with each other? Trade has no big winners. 




 How exactly this freetrade deal going to counter China, if we already do trade with China, but not in a formal agreement to eliminate tariffs on each other to 0%. We already get a lot of their imports yet China still maintains a higher tariff on us than our tariff on Chinese goods? Freetrade tries to makes all prices and wages in the world close to world equilibrium. 




 What is not to say that we also manipulate our currency as well? 




 No it won't. Free-Trade lifts all boats. Consumers can buy stuff at a cheaper price. Without Trade, your goods will cost a lot more and you will have less choices to choose from. That is why the agreement is secret, so we have to get the best trade offer out there, which lifts all boats overall. There are no losers and trade deficits don't matter because..... you just imported more goods than you export, which means consumers are having a lot of choices. 

Back in the 1920s, when manufacturing jobs were present, how come nobody wanted blacksmithing jobs back?
Why make stuff for our own usage when we can just get items from other places for cheap? We need to depend on other growing economies for our growth. :)


 




 If you agree to buy a lot of my big business products and natural resources, I will buy your bridge for cheaper than the other guy. But don't tell the other guy, okay?
 




 My only hope to get Polster into my starting lineup is to hope Ishizaki, Davies, or Woodberry doesn't play in the next game.... . 




 Trade Agreements are secret so American Businesses and Consumers can get the best trade deal offer. If we open it up, then we might lose in a freetrade deal that lifts all boats because there would be too many amendments and hidden secrets exposed. 

 




 Really annoying people. Like sure spend $80 on a box and destroy everything lol 




 I have researched a lot of strange ideology combinations that try to appear "moderate" like:

Liberal Conservative, Progressive Conservative, Compassionate Conservative, Third Way Liberals, and Conservative Liberals

I know there is a slight difference between each one, but do they fit in centrism?  




 Ya or you can run 3 cores and 1 machine dup, but have a card where you discard a card. 




 Personally, it is good to have cyber valleys on the field to stall, but they aren't "cyber dragon". 

It really depends though. If you have 3 cores and 1 machine dup, what happens if you already used 3 cores, you would need a card that has discard eff? 




 You don't need 3 Power Bonds because you will probably won't fusion summon 3 times. Why have 2 machine dups, if there isn't 2 targets for it? You don't want to dead draw it.  




 Will some of the lore will be altered or not exist?  




 You provide one team. how about QPR, Wigan, etc? Those teams enter the EPL and then get relegated. There are more teams that get relegated than teams who compete well in the EPL. In a perfect world, each EPL team wins the league every 20 years (assuming no relegation). Of course, we know that it is impossible, since no league in any sport is that competitive. We see the same to similar top tier teams in the top nearly every year and it lasts for decades.    




 Why is nobody talking about the trade deficit ? has freetrade helped to decrease our current trade deficit or do trade deficits don't matter since trade lifts all boats? 




 Simple. American small businesses don't have the massive world outreach. Foreigners don't know if there is a small business in America who sells similar items to an American Big Business. A small business can't really set up shop or manufacturing place in a foreign company as easily. 




 Agricultural jobs were never middle class. They have always been low wage and in need of subsidizes.  




 It will happen once every country engages in near freetrade. Then everything is at world equilibrium in prices and wages. 




 it is weird though because usually deficits of any kind is bad in mathematical perspective, but trade deficits is fine according to current economic thinking. As long as you engage in trade, then it lifts all boats. 




 Yes that also works but it is not competitive since the good players on the bottom teams leave the team.  




 The reason is because the top flight teams want to stay in the top flight. Very good players always want to go to the best team, so it inherently favors the top teams. What is the point of joining a bottom tier premier league team, if they will be relegated in the future? 




 people don't know that taxation on limited vertical supply with a diagonal demand curve makes the consumers pay nearly all the tax. 




 Watch Nelson Rockefeller's speech to the GOP national convention in 1964. Some of his remarks can be applied to today's time era. 




 I love my state and my constituents, but I hate your politicians and your interests.

Low Approval Rating of Congress, yet nearly 90%+ incumbency.
 




 Who cares. Just agree with it because..... it is a freetrade agreement. Trade = Good Economics :)

- Nearly Every Economist, Business leader, Conservative Republicans, and Pro-Trade Democrats. 




 Rockefeller Republicans and Progressive/Liberal Republicans would like to have a word with you. lol

 




 Nelson Rockefeller (the moderate Rockefeller Republicans were booed by the Goldwater Conservatives in the 1964 GOP National Convention), Dwight Eisenhower (desegregated the Southern Schools from Conservative Dixicrats + continued the New Deal + warned about the military industrial complex), Richard Nixon (who enacted the EPA and basically was Keynesian in economics), Teddy Roosevelt (one of the leaders of the progressive movement), and Abraham Lincoln (freed the slaves and opposed the States Rights Movement + Supported the idea of the federal government assistance in building railroads) would be shocked at how conservative and southern/rural the Republican Party currently is. 

Also, Bob Dole stated, "I thought I was a conservative, but weve got some in Congress now who are so far right theyre about to fall out of the Capitol."

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/23/bob-dole-says-the-republican-party-is-way-more-conservative-than-it-was-even-20-years-ago-hes-right/ 




 Yep. :D
 




 Ya. It is so impossible to summon this out except from a cyber dragon nova deck.  




 Somewhat...but it also tells us that teams are unwilling to play starting players often during double game weeks, so they can rest players, etc 




 barbaroid the ultimate battle machine  




 Exactly, Rockefeller denounced extremism from both the left and right and was booed because of that. 




 LOL Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings that battled each other out for control. Those factions were very regional. progressive republicans and southern democrats found their true ideological homes now. 




 But freetrade benefits the entire economy overall say economists and business leaders. Think about the cheap prices that we get in goods and think of the markets that you wouldn't have without trade such as coffee, Japanese cars, and Accessories from the Middle East. Do Americans want to pay higher prices for goods that they consume today? Probably not. tariffs are bad. 




 If people back then had a 90% marginal income tax rate and people say that the effective tax rate was much lower.....and if today people's marginal income tax rate is around 30 to 40%, but the effective tax rate can reach 0% for some people, Wouldn't the effective tax rate back then be higher than today's effective tax rate? 




 The effective tax rate back then would still be higher than the effective tax rate today.  




 However, I only have 3 defenders. Should I place Bedell on the team and put Davies and Polster on the bench, so if Polster gets 1 point, then I could just replace Bedell with Davies. If Polster gets more than 4 points, He will be subbed into Bedell, but do I get to replace Woodberry with Davies?  




 I never really tried out this tactic, but good to know. :D Thanks! 




 :| 




 I had Rolfe earlier in the weeks prior.  




 Why three Artifact Sanctums, but only 2 Artifacts?

Batteryman Industrial Strength is more of a side-deck card against slower decks. It is a dead draw, if you don't have an engine to throw thunder cards into the grave. I recommend Thunder Dragons.+ 1 Hand Destruction than 2 Cardcar Ds

You could add Abyss Stungray, but it is trap monster, level 5, Thunder 









 Like you said. Drei's effect is manual and doesn't say that you use in another player's turn.  




 Firebirds is an amazing name 




 Search "pojo batteryman guide" on google and find the most recent thread. :) 




 Effects that have either player's turn is quick play while manual is spell speed 1 




 he is probably a pawn from the fusion dimension. After all, he noticed cuz summoning and commented with a strange tone. Plus, he has purple stuff, which is fusion dimension stuff. 




 I have a feeling that the guy with purple hair at the end is from the fusion dimension.  




 I might consider voting for Kasich for President, but given that he will choose the next Supreme Court Justice....Probably not.  




 Kasich is one of the most decent Republican candidates out of the ones listed.

Rubio and Paul are semi-okay in my opinion, but not preferred. 


 




 Ishizaki :) 




 I am just stating the position of people with academic knowledge in economics and business. I don't necessary agree with them, but I do agree with Reich's view on some concerning aspects.  




 Mexico, where the USA claims that their economy has gotten better, but illegal immigration still is a problem from there.  




 Ya, but I personally don't believe all the "talking points" of pro-free-trade in full. Yes, they do have a point, but there are lots of anti-freetrade points as well.  




 http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus

Include Healthcare Spending, Environmental Cleanup, Research, Housing, etc 




 It doesn't make sense at the moment because the current transit and spread of development isn't focused on rail nor public transit, but rather cars. Keep in mind, you can't expand roads within cities and highways can't be expanded if development is already there, so there should be other modes of transit, if cities don't want massive congestion problems during rush-hour.  




 "i think the congestion of highways has far more to do with an increased supply of motor vehicles as opposed to increased supply of highways" 

Cars are unusable, if nobody rides them. If the overall economy gains more cars, not everybody is using all the cars. Transportation is the act of people going from place to place. Once highways are more open, congestion and time travel would be less, which in turn decreases usage of commuter rail + public transit, which moves those people onto the highways. That is induced demand. There is no point in public transit because the lifestyle is already revolved around cars. Yes, if you live in an area with population not growing and build bigger highways, yes there will be less congestion.  




 Infrastructure spending is necessary in any urban area. without it, you will have heavy sprawl with 8 lane highways one way in some highways in Georgia. Plus, you still have traffic+congestion from induced demand, so you would need to build even more lanes and roads.  




 Building more Highways causes induced demand, which will keep them congested, if population continues to grow. Also, highways and roads take up more space than train tracks. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand 




 Tax Cuts, Loans for Businesses, Subsidizes, Unemployment benefits, Education Loans, Education Spending, Infrastructure Spending, etc 




 They just point to an easier shift for workers to go into better "industries", lower prices of goods for consumers, businesses doing well, developing countries gaining better living standards. 




 There are no losers in free-trade in the overall perspective according to people with knowledge on trade economics. 




 http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus

 




 Yes. The same applies for military spending for soldiers. Healthcare spending for doctors. Subsidizes for Businesses. Tax Cuts for Taxpayers. 




 about around 40-110 billion dollars out of the 800 billion dollars went to infrastructure. This is little compared to the 1 trillion dollars+ we actually need. 




 because the stimulus was 1/3 tax cuts. Infrastructure was only up to 100 billion of the 800 billion allocated for the stimulus. You need to do research on the stimulus.  




 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also supports it as well even though they were against it decades ago. 




 Also, Some Highways there are 8 lanes on both sides and both are still congested during rush hour.  




 then supports and votes for anti-pork barrel projects, wasteful spending, abolishing gas tax, etc politicians. The cycle continues. 




 Obama also wants us to get out of our cars by discouraging car usage. Thanks Obama! 




 This is generally a problem in the south, but also in Michigan with regards to the gas tax increase. they don't want money spent on public transit but rather on just roads and highway expansions.  




 It was only around 40 to 100 billion dollars of the 800 billion allocated for the stimulus. 




 Laguardia airport, Amtrak, Public transit in cities not in the Northeast, west coast, and sections of the Midwest  




 Cost too much. Citizens vote down any gas tax hike. Budget deficits. Some view infrastructure as pork barrel spending. Some blame inefficient government ex: house members on Amtrak 




 I could honestly see conservatives saying, "Democrats run the cities and manage bad infrastructure. Thus, Democrats create bad infrastructure, while Republicans in rural states have better infrastructure because our roads and highways are paved." 

^^^

Ignoring the fact that infrastructure maintenance and project expansions+modernization costs insane amounts of money.....  




 What!?!?! You tell me that we should reduce the supply of our defenses? We are #1, so stop trying to make America look weak and broken. ;)

Think about the other countries, when they see America disarming. :| 




 But people need to be educated in order to get to higher paying jobs such as Engineering. Entry Level Jobs are not a living. :)

If Conservatives used the same logic for military spending, "Soldiers support increased military spending because they benefit from it." Bad. 




 Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, etc 




 I am pretty sure Rand would want better infrastructure, but I believe that he would side more on the property rights side, when the government needs to reorganize the land for infrastructure projects. Also, he would be more pro-privatization. For example, Amtrak would be fully privatized.  




 Yes, but I don't think Congress will pass such a plan in the near future. :\ 




 I bet that they would even go as far to say "Military = Socialism"  




 Reducing the Gas Tax would reduce revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. but....

The real question is whether a reduction in the gas tax will encourage more people on cars traveling or not. Elasticity question.

 




 I posted this because of the video. I feel like the article is pretty straightforward from what we have heard for months now.

 Roids. We need an injection of roids! 




 Nico's voice is fine, if you have watched Yugioh GX. Zuzu's voice is what I would expect. Personally, I wished Yuya's voice was similar to that of Jaden, since at the moment, it does sound a bit annoying, but I can get used to it. Gong is what throws me off. Like....Texan Voice? LOL 




 Yuya's, Gong's, and Skip's voice don't really match. Why is Gong a Texan? 




 Why do the voices sound so strange? 




 Yet Japan still manufactures cars for its own citizens and for export. Something that American manufacturing can't seem to do. 




 Seattle and New England's defense are pretty decent so I don't really expect him to get a lot of points, but expect the unexpected lol
