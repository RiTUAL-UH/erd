 I give it an hour before these responses pop up in a Buzzfeed titled "The 100 items from your childhood you wish you still had."

 So edgy. 




 My father's nose. I can't find a good way to store it.  









 I'm not terribly sure I understand what this is about. I downloaded it. So far I don't know what it does that Spotify premium doesn't? A more social experience? 




 I'm not sure I see the big fuss here.  




 Hootsuite. 









 "Girlfriend." LOL 




 /r/facepalm 




 First 5min of the movie What Happens In Vegas 




 I just recently left in Feb. But I know a lot about the interviews and how recruiters think.

Like a previous poster said, smile. Always smile.
Don't talk about how much you love Disneyland. They don't care who your favorite character is or how many times you've been.
When they ask you your number one concern, it is ALWAYS safety.
Think about how the four keys of Disneyland (Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency) affect your role and answer the questions in that way. You're not supposed to know those keys right now so don't talk about knowing them but casually mentioning them would be prime (i.e. "I recognize that to be a great CM, I have to be courteous to all guests when performing my role."
That's another one: don't forget to think of yourself when answering questions as a part of a show, a cast member with a role. 
That's about it. They typically offer the jobs on the spot if they like you.

Good luck. Say hi to the Mouse for me.  









 Marvin must be rolling in the dough. 




 Thanks so much! 





























 As a writer of comedy, not only has reddit shown me that they receive humor like mine well, it is also an amazing resource to get exposure to my twitter which I am thankful for. Sorry if this ruins your day.   




 Hey man, not everyone posts for karma.  









 No fucking way. You won't believe me.... but I am seriously watching this for the first time and just opened your post up... wow.

 Wake up in the morning feeling like Guantanamo.  









 **BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THIS**
I'M SERIOUS. LISTEN UP.
Make your availability fully open on your application.
**THIS IS HOW THEY PICK PEOPLE TO INTERVIEW**

I'm a former CM, former as in just left after spending over a year there. This is for certain the #1 to get seen.  




 The story of my life.  




 NICKLEBACK. PHOTOGRAPH. 




 "In spite" instead of "despite."  









 Cue the /r/KarmaConspiracy post stating a disgusting owner killed these kittens.... 




 Yep. Looks about right. 




 I've worked 2 Superbowl Sundays at Disneyland. This is not true for Disneyland. Too many people from all over the world have planned a vacation months in advance. However, lots of folks wear jerseys and are constantly checking their phones instead of watching where they step, that's certain.  




 Okay, we get it. You're funny. Please make this AMA worth something to us by giving us real answers to our questions, please. 




 Every post. Every time.  




 Double whammy if he was masturbating to gay porn.... in the closet... heh.. I'll show myself out. 




 Dr Phil has nothing on you.  




 FOR ALL THAT SWEET, JUICY SELF POST KARMA RIGHT?
