 i guess it depends on the type of person you are. for me i need to share things I'm a very emotional guy so its tough for me to keep stuff bottled up, but i believe talking about things with someone can always be some sort of help. I'm all for therapy ! 




 Great advice, thanks a lot ! 




 i want too i just find it a little tough getting into situations where i can meet new people if that makes sense ? 




 Okay so let me first start of by saying this was stupid of me and the rule of 'don't shit where you eat' i truly believe now but i recently split up with my girlfriend she broke up with me. normally i would cut all contact but the thing is she's my next door neighbour and part of my friend group so basically i have to see her near enough every day. how would you guys cope with it. because I'm finding it really tough   




 hey guys bit of a silly one. i got diagnosed with depression recently and I'm trying to learn to live with it but in the back of my head I'm thinking some mystical girl will come along and it will all go away. how do i make myself believe a girlfriend isn't the answer ? 




 whiplash  




 yeah i really want that feeling again haha 




 Holy ghost, there fucking amazing ! i've been getting into a lot of synth-pop lately  




 nothing i can say will make anything better but i'm thinking of you bud 




 my god you're amazing ! at the risk of sounding like a basement dweller can i pm you ?  




 thanks I'm more optimistic now than i've ever been 




 citalopram  




 yeah i've felt like i've had it for a few years now i feel almost good that somethings been done, i've been put on some anti-deppressions for 2 weeks then i have some blood-tests now its just dealing with it i guess, thanks for caring !

 im all for it ! 




 thank you so much it means an awful lot 




 i really cant thank you enough for this message, i feel like as the cliche goes really alone right now, thanks for caring you don't know how much it means  




 [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DswBily.jpg) Hey everyone ! 




 thanks for listening ! its been a shitty 2015 so far  




 aww thanks :) it means a lot, it seems like because this happens to everyone that it means it doesn't hurt. like I'm allowed to be upset ! 




 my girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago, and i just feel kind of worthless kind of like I'm in a blackhole. i wasnt perfect but man i loved her 




 Just being able to see her always made me feel better, I'm quite an emotional person so i have a lot of really good days and a lot of really bad days. but whatever happened when she walked in and looked at me with those big green eyes and gave me a hug i felt like the most important person in the world. it didn't quite work out as she broke up with me a few weeks ago but maybe i'll find someone special again some day
 




 open ! why would anyone close them ? 




 i've been called charismatic twice over the last few weeks, just been through a terrible break-up so being called charismatic is awesome  




 being happy 




 thanks mate your right ! 




 what makes you so sure ? 




 seeing an old friend on my way through london tomorrow. cant wait ! 




 well i've had a few girlfriends and a load of shitty one night stands but this girl was the only one i really cared about. its gonna be very tough getting over her, feeling like I'm in a blackhole right now and i don't know how I'm gonna get out. but I'm sure in time i'll feel better. plus she's in my circle of close friends so I'm gonna have to see her everyday. but everyone on here has helped a lot :). thanks for caring 

think i misread your comment. sorry haha 




 Hey everyone i don't post a whole bunch here but i've been through a real tough time recently with a break-up and being the time of year its been rough and lonely but i just wanted to thank everyone. everyone here has helped a whole bunch. so i just wanted to say thanks a lot for helping a silly heart-broken kid like me haha 




 jesus christ 




 yeah i don't understand sometimes haha cant we just have a chat about films with no ego involved  




 why are you getting so defensive ? 




 anchorman  




 try catch 22 or i am legend when i wanted to get into reading i started with them.  




 shouldn't have read this just after a break-up man I'm all upset again  




 knowing the person you love doesn't want you anymore  




 Great suggestion ! 




 Hey guys I'm looking to do a save with an old squad that would need rebuilding. so what I'm looking for is a team with good youth facilities preferably in one of the big leagues but with quite an old squad. thanks for the help  




 well then... 




 its like we're already best friends 




 i don't know your scottish I'm from london I'm not sure how long i'd be able to keep up  




 if you're gonna drink something with red bull it might as well be your own self respect  




 fuck all these red-bull vodka bullshit. thats for sissies am i right ! 




 haha i go to uni in stoke. probably not the best idea  




 good advice  




 like i do that but like i never usually meet new people that way i love reading and i love film and i don't really meet people at the cinema or at the bookstore if that makes sense  




 Hey guys this isn't a forever alone post or anything but i've recently went through a break-up and i have kind of figured out that i don't have a lot of friends and i want to make some more. now i know how to socialise i consider myself funny-ish and i'm pretty friendly and caring but  the problem i have is making the first move or putting myself in a position to meet more people. basically i want to meet more people with the hope of making friends. I don't know what hobbies i could pick up or what to do in order to meet more people. if it helps I'm 21 and live in the uk. thanks for the tips and if this question gets posted a lot I'm sorry. i didn't know where else to go.  




 its awesome  




 heres a few of me :)

 i think the use of lighting in the film is really special as well. really amazing film. 




 Drive easily drive 




 Carnage by Roman Polanski  




 if its the truth and its a good thing then its the best thing I'm going to hear all day. 




 moving into a new house with people i don't know forced me to be social and make new friends and it has resulted in a group of friends I'm really fond of and an amazing girlfriend that i really like for the first time in my life.  




 i think its more about natural chemistry with a person so when they say funny i think they mean someone they will naturally get along with and find funny 




 HOT ! 




 eye contact is crucial ! its the difference between a good blow job and a great one  




 last night, been going through a rough few days when it comes to friends and family and i got on a rant about my knob step-dad and yeah. my girlfriend understood and made me feel better about it. 




 this cracks really morish 




 being totally comfortable  with who you are and with acting like yourself.  




 for me i use cinema to help get me through tough times, the art of the motion picture is a great tool. i always watch musicals when I'm feeling low. i understand mate i've been in a very similar situation just find something that you enjoy even if its listening to a great album then at least you have something to look forward to wether its your favourite meal or just watching some t.v always have something to look forward to. and try and get as much exercise as possible. hope this helps at least a little and if you need someone to chat to. you can PM me anytime. i've been there mate you're not alone 




 reddit is generally full of hate, i try and stick to the smaller communities where people are actually pretty nice.  




 watch them all and then watch them all again ! 




 i really want to do hull and port vale this year ! 




 FUCKING DRIVE ! 




 funny people, i thought it was a great comment on friendship,ambitions and relationships 




 ohh i see now. thanks a lot for your help !
