 Really? You obviously haven't seen the Love Guru 




 Road to Perdition 




 City of God? 




 A Few Good Men? 




 Second pick YOU FUCK 




 And the only ones without a Superbowl ring ;)
Edit: I have more downvotes than the Eagles do Superbowl Rings MUAHAHAHAHA 




 FINE, Let the rock off, BEGIN HAHAHAHAHHA 




 Not my tempo 




 So Santana did deflate those balls 




 Klaus thinks this is 2K15 and always tried to get the steal but it always leads to a foul 




 Damn he was playing Disneyland, So method 




 This movie is almost guaranteed to be pushed back to January or February  




 I think I got something in my teeth, could you get it out for me? 




 Yeah I guess so, still sucks gargantuan monkey nuts 




 Very true, however I just don't want to see RG3 die 




 Sooo are we in agreement that the league hates RG3? 




 RGIII's first game will be against the Dolphins, a defense consisting of Suh and Wake......are you fucking kidding me. 




 And RGIII has to play this defense week 1.....fuck 




 Hell throw in Meechum and we can have a Meechsome 




 Just Forget about Dre 




 End of watch 




 Big Fat liar
 




 Twilight 









 Ehhhh 3 years ago is awhile ago, Sabotage was shit and he wasn't the lead or anything, Avatar 2 I guess will have him back so there is that but I doubt it will cause a resurgence of his career. 




 Oh no, we're getting into to the hate circlejerk for a popular movie, not saying you're circlejerking though, however this is the post that will lead to "Am I the only who hated Mad Max Fury Road?" And then "Why Mad Max gave me HIV"
