 Jesus Christ! If you want to be an asshole about this whole thing then lets take a look at your beautiful very polite post we have here. Not a shred of reasoning to disprove anything. I thought this was a safe place with knowledgeable individuals. Put down the bong? Really? All I was doing was throwing a theory out there and hoping for intelligent people to explain why this definitively could not work because I sincerely want to know. None of which you addressed. like the idea of that dark matter and black holes may be linked which is probably non-since but I guess ideas (even exotic ones) are worthless to you. I have studied astrophysics, graduated, and somehow I still manage to not be a total dick. I just wanted to throw out a crazy idea that I wanted others to disproof and talk about. After all isn't that the basis of new ideas? Thank you for your very awesome post that will surly incurage me to be less open minded. Much apreciated 




 ^Great ^^white ^^^bufflo 




 Does anyone out there have any ideas what might be in the Cincinnati box in the Hot Tub Time Machine movies? I just watched the second one and they mention the box a lot more than the first movie but still no clues to whats in it. If you haven't seen the second movie please still give some ideas because like I said you know just as much about the box even if you haven't seen the second movie. I read that the writers of the films may be trying to make another movie that starts off with this mystery or is based around it but I got the impression at the end of the second movie that they won't be making anymore. Please comment if you have any knowledge about this as well. Remember that the Cincinnati box is a shoe box so whatever it contains must fit in it (or does it?) I'm curious what we can come up with. 




 Thats badass then. Nice work. also dig the gauges
 




 why no love here? I think this is badass. Is your hair really green? 









 Came here to say just that! 




 Thanks a lot man. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out 




 How would I wire up a balancer circuit to my charger. Most R/C battery's have a wire you just plug into the charger? Any Idea? 




 Thanks for the info, I understand all those terms. I have a R/C car battery charger that charges every kind of battery and has build in voltage protection and lots of other features. Would that work as a PCM. Im not an idiot. Its not like im plugging the thing into a wall socket. I have my charger set to charge 2 cells with the combined MAh of both battery's. Now would that work?

This is what I have... http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/131355448556-0-1/s-l1000.jpg
 




 [Here is a pic] (http://i.imgur.com/SGMgzxp.jpg?1) 




 So I have 2 battery's vertical in there battery sled. One battery with its positive side at the top and the other with its negative side at the top. At the bottom there is a wire connecting the two. If I connect a battery charger to the top of the 2 battery's will they both charge equally? or do I need some type of balancer. These are li-ion batterys.  Thanks in advance if anyone can give me the answer! 




 I was expecting a bit more with the decent album cover and then... Holy shit this is absolute garbage. 














 Well thank you fellow vapor! I'm a perfectionist and have a lot of patience. That's the key to clean builds. Taking your time and not rushing things.    




 Oh I see. For me my comfort zone is 0.2 to 0.6 so those lower ohms for me are on the other end of the spectrum of this build. Didn't mean to go 101 on you haha 




 Compared to harsh hot builds that give you great clouds but sacrifice on flavor and smoothness of the vape. This build gives great flavor with a smooth vape but im not blowing huge clouds.  




 Thank you, I wrapped them around a micro screw driver that's the same diameter as a .093 (42) drill bit. 









 nice. I do the same. I have 2 vapes, my RBA for the clouds and then my Evod2 for the taste and just to sit and puff all night on. The duel must really take the ohms down. But your also using 24 gauge so maybe its mostly that. 




 Nice build! Can you tell me if the juice flavors are harsh or weak with that kind of cloud and low ohms? 




 Its not rocket science, its VAPE SCIENCE! and yea dont be a dick. There is a lot to building coils when you want to know what your doing. But if you want to just loop a wire and stick it in a tank then, yea its not hard. 




 Thanks for clarifying that for me. 




 Thank you for taking the time and writing that up. Its really what I was looking for. My knowledge before vapeing was R/C stuff so I know a lot about Battery safety, wattage, voltage, ext. but terms like Resistance, and Ohms are new terms to me. I am reading all about ohms law right now but would you (or someone else) explain Resistance to me? What aspect of vaping does Resistance effect? Flavor? vape? Heat? 

Edit: Sweetleef took care of it. Thanks! 




 1. What is the advantages/disadvantages between tight wound coils and spread out coils.
2. How does the amount of wraps effect heat, vape, ext... (Is is more wraps less heat?) Im looking for a simplified answer even though I know this is a very large question.
3. What is the effect that larger wraps (aka macro coils)and smaller wraps (nano) produce?

Ive been looking for answers to these questions and its hard to come by straight forward answers because I know its not a easy question, but if anyone can simplify these answers I would REALLY appreciate it. Thanks guys! 




 Find a corner, go under a blanket maybe?, yea a car, maybe the floor in a good spot. I'm sure you can find a spot. A good way to test is to softly let some vape out your mouth and see how it moves. If it just kinda lingers thats fine but if it moves find somewhere else. 
 




 You would be amazed of how little air flow can REALLY effect vape smoke. Even when I blow rings over my laptop they dissipate fast because of the computer fan even though it blows down on the desk. My advice is find an area with no air flow and give it a go. Remember to get the smoke in your mouth not your lungs and not to push them out to hard. I use a combo of clicking my jaw a bit and a little push with my tong. Good luck. 




 Those are awesome. So many ideas I got from them. Thank you!
 









 Reminds me of that true life episode *Im a rap artist* (or some name like that) where the kid dresses like hes already a rapper and thinks hes going to get a huge record deal then they show him at a show and theres like 8 people there and hes so bad is hard to watch. 




 FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! NOOOOOO 




 HAHA, Is that on a piece of printer paper?! 




 That's what I thought and always known. Thanks. 




 I also read somewhere that Suboxone added the Naloxone to its recipe just so they could patent the name because just bup was taken by the brand subutex and that bup itself is the primary blocker and the low dose of the Naloxone doesnt do much at all. If what I read is right then suboxone and subutex block opiates the same way and you can't feel a p30 on eather. Please help me guys cause I thought this was common knowlage but my friend thinks hes 100% sure. 




 My friend swears up and down that you can take subutex and do a p30 right after and feel both of the drugs. Anyone have any input on this? Is he right? I thought the Buprenorphine was what does most of the blocking and Subutex is just Bup. I need some advice cause that would be awesome if my friend was right but I dont want to chance it without knowing. 




 man, its an honor. (Hope your not just messing with us.) I'm going to buy a print off that site you provided. I didn't realize you went through so many images. How did you have your camera setup? was it on a timer? did you take a picture every half hour even at night? (wouldn't that be a waste?) just curious, thanks! 




 The Earth is breathing. 




 Dude... Whoa
 




 I did the same. And thanks for the upvote! 














 I've used a box filled with an old sweatshirt, old jeans, and duct tape to hold it together and my .22 pellet rifle wont go all the way through. Pretty simple to make. I'm sure you can figure something out. 




 This was really interesting to listen too.
