 Honestly, if you are still not like sub 1:00 to like sub40 consistently, the cube wont matter. I suggest getting a decent cheap cube on ebay, like a 5-10 dollar. I just checked canada ebay and there are a few decent ones. The important thing is learning all of PLL and OLL, and getting fast at F2L. I used a broken in rubiks brand with lube until I was sub 45 consistently. Then I switched to a zhanchi and have had it for a while.  




 Can we talk about this for a second? Why are M and E slices on the secondary faces? Why just those two? Why couldnt everything just be relative to RUF? This always bothered me but I just learned it "cuz thats the way it is." 




 I used his page to learn. It is a wonderful resource. Also check out his algorithm changer if you try to make your own algs using cube explorer or something. And if I remember correctly, he has a eoline scrambler that you can input the number of bad edges you want and it will return scrambles for that. 

And for last layer stuff, also check out [petrus' s site.]( http://lar5.com/cube/index.html) The last layer stuff and the last block stuff is relevant, as well as subsets of the general block building stuff. He has a neat 2-alg 1 look LL idea. 

E: cant find the EOline scrambler that I mentioned, but I found this on the speedsolving wiki: [eoline solver]( http://rubiks-cube.c0.pl/inne/eoline.html). I havent looked at it because Im on my phone though.  




 I do zz and once you get past eoline, it is blazing fast. I am currently learning COLL and that is comparable to OLL in amount of algs anyways, so if you dont know OLL (which I never learned full OLL either) then this might be an option. Also, COLL is useful if you do K4 on larger cubes or roux or a couple other methods and is a good precursor to full zbll if you wanted to go that route. 

Also try roux or petrus. They start out with a lot less structured block building so if you have difficulties with that, ZZ is the way to go. I seriously considered petrus before settling on ZZ. The last half of your solve is similar in petrus and zz anyways. You just orient at a different stage and your first block is more intuitive 

EOLine will be the biggest hurdle for you when starting. If you decide to go that route, I suggest taking eoline slow. Dont do eo+line because you will get in the habbit. Just slowly plan out eoline and do it with your eyes closed then check it. After a couple weeks you should be good.  




 Give me your password and I can find it for you.  




 If you want to be friends, just be friends. Fuck what everyone else says. And if more comes from it then so be it. Unless you really really want a friendship or dont see her like that. Then establish some ground rules about what is happening and what can happen.  




 Why though. If you decide to ignore everything everyone said and claim it was a conspiracy, then why? Letting it run its course is enough of a test. A 20 minute outage is not sufficiently a test because plenty of people would not have seen it.  




 Maybe you can get on tv. Chris hansen has a new show comming out.  









 People that "made" the months did it a long time ago and kind of estimated. A month is about the length of a lunar cycle, for example. And you will find that a lunar cycle is actually a couple days short of a 30 or 31 day month. But a long time ago it was "close enough."

Also, they used to use seasons for crop growing and didnt need to be dead on. A couple days off was ok. You will find that throughout history, the length of a year, amount of months, and all those details have changed a bit. 

The issue comes down to relating a precise system based on astronomical events, and a system that humans use and can remember. It would be confusing if a year was 365.25 days and that was divided into 12 blocks of 30.4 days, etc. Weekends and holidays would be weird every year and stuff like that. So we kinda adapt the traditional stuff with the stuff we know is accurate today, and every couple years adjust the calendar (leap years).

It is possible for us all decide to shift the year and say, have summer start on the 1st of june and stuff like that, and we have shifted the calendar before in human history. But today it would take so much effort to coordinate that between 7 billion people and fix all the software issues that come from it and all that. 

So the short answer is: its not aligned because our ancestors didnt align it centuries ago.  




 TL;DR  I ducked up.

FTFY
 




 Am poor, plz halp 




 It would further strengthen my disbelief 




 Thats it?.. 




 Yea, checking your tubes is a 3rd date kind of thing.

 And a couple weeks ago, and a couple more weeks ago, and a year ago like it is done every year, aND OH SHIT I JUST REALIZED MOTHERS DAY IS THIS WEEKEND!! FUCK, I need to get something.  




 Same thing 




 I never bought any of that "size matters" crap until my junior year in college. I lived in the dorms with two roommates, David and John. David was a pretty ordinary looking guy, kinda quiet - but John was tall, lean, muscular and (according to him anyway) was hung like a bull. He used to joke about it a lot - even around my girlfriend, Amy. Amy was a sophomore and was petite, shy and somewhat quiet. I didn't like it when John would make his "big dick" comments and jokes around Amy, but she told me she didn't pay any attention to him and truth be told, she really couldn't stand John.

I have a 5.5" dick and with Amy being so petite, it always seemed to do the trick. I was only the third guy she'd ever been with and only her second boyfriend - maybe my guard was just down but who knows.

Anyway, one Friday night, Amy and I were hanging out in my dorm room drinking, smoking some weed and watching TV. David and John had both gone home for the weekend - or so we thought. At about 1AM (Amy and I were pretty toasted by then), John walked in. He'd ended up hanging out with some of his friends off campus and had decided to just drive home in the morning since his parents only lived about an hour and a half away.
He could see that Amy and I were both pretty hammered. He grabbed a beer and sat down and we smoked somem more weed with him. Amy was pretty drunk and started giving John shit. John seemed to get a kick out of it and I could see him kinda flirting with Amy. Then I noticed (and hoped that Amy wouldn't) that John wasn't wearing any underwear.

But Amy started massaging my dick through my jeans and being so fucked up, I just laid my head back and enjoyed it - I couldn't believe she was doing that right in front of John! I heard John get up to pass Amy the joint we were smoking and I heard her gasp, long and deep and she suddenly stopped stroking my dick. I opened my eyes and saw John standing righ tin front of Amy with a HUGE fucking bulge in his pants - just inches from her face. The room was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop.
He just stood there and I could feel her hand tremble and hear her breathing quicken. when she slowly looked up at him, almost in awe and respect, I could feel my heart start to pound in my chest. Then she softly whispered "ohhhhhhhhhhh" as she gingerly reached up to brush her finger tips across that massive knot in his pants. When she touched it, it throbbed - shit I could see it throb thorugh his pants - Amy just gasped again and looked up at him.

"What?" John asked her and just kinda laughed. Amy did NOT laugh. Instead, she softly asked "can i see it?" John stopped laughing, looked at her very seriously and told her to take it out. Amy never even hesitated - or looked back at me for an "OK" - just just obeyed him and began to open his jeans. I coudl see her nipples rock hard under her t-shirt and I could tell she was practically panting.

She opened his jeans and his big thick dick just fell out...and he had NOT been kidding. That cock was strong, thick, heavy and muscular. The head was a big purple mushroom that sat on top of the thickest shaft i'd ever seen. He was semi-hard and was HUGE compared to me. Amy just gasped and kept whispering "ohmygod..ohmygod...ohmygod". When she wrapped her hand around it, her brow just knotted in disbelief and she almost laughed at how thick he was - her fingers couldn't even touch.
John just stood there watching my girlfriend worship his magnificent cock. Slowly shaking her head in disbelief, she two-fisted him - one hand next to the other...and there was STILL a few inches left - and he was getting rock hard, too.

Amy smiled and patted the couch next to her and John sat down, his cock standing straight up. Honestly he had to be almost 10" (judging from the size of Amy's hand). I opened my pants and took my own cock out. Amy took my cock in her left hand and John's in her right - but there was little doubt whose cock was getting more attention. She couldn't take her eyes off his cock and her hand only occasionally stroked my dick...but John's she pumped with long, purposeful strokes until she finally couldn't help herself any longer and knelt in front of him, kissing his cock and rubbing it against her soft pale skin.

She sucked his dick until SHE came - just from sucking him! I stroked the whole time until he pulled her toward him, peeled off her pants (she didnt even make the slightest attempt to stop him) and sat her on his lap, her back to his chest - the two of them right next to me. She just rolled her head back to kiss him as he squeezed her tits through her shirt. Her hands went down and pushed that big cock against her pussy and she groaned so loud when it touched her that I thought people outside would hear.

John's dick was so fucking big that he easily penetrated her from behind with her sitting on his lap. She arched up so she could take as much of it as she could and they started to fuck right there next to me. It shocked me how easily her petite little body accomodated that horse cock of his. John pounded her in positions that i physically CANNOT do for over an hour - I have no idea how many times she came - she was even in tears a few times (though she never once told him to stop).

He asked her if she was on the pill and when she said she was on the patch, he told her that he was going to cum inside of her to mark her - which only made her cum again! when he finally came, he had Amy on her back, her legs shaking violently as they both came together - and true to his word, John dumped his seed deep up inside my girlfriend's pussy right in front of me. But shit - he didn't even lose his damn hard on! They fucked for about another 40 minutes and he came twice more. Amy was a wreck by the time we all went to bed.

I will never forget the look on her face - like she was afraid of him and in love with him all at once - the whole time they fucked. She later told me that there were no words to describe it - it was incredible but even that didn't seem enough. To my knowledge they never fucked again and Amy and I dated for about another year before we finally broke up. I always wondered if she ended up with him or some other big dick guy.
But one thing I know for sure - she NEVER fucked me like she did John and the things she said about John - the way she looked at him - and the way she was around him after that night (almost shy and meek) convinced me that a big dick makes a difference.

Amy told me that she "HAD to respect him" even if she didn't like him...and that she almost felt like he "had a right to her". So there ya go. 




 Why do we care about the button at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this sub is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 6 colors and a timer. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?

(btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)

I have watched this sub ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this april fools joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole sub isn't *nothing* but an april fools joke, the users have definitely turned this sub into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the button. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of colors and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.

This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and r/thebutton is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a timer. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.

Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this sub was probably inspired by that.

 But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this sub beyond literally watching a timer. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/religions. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun this was.

Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this sub can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many religions and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless? 

This whole sub is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over pressing the button. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that red's are better than purple's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny". 

This whole sub, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that greys don't hate purples (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy pusher" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**

 Why not? If someone is willing to buy it, you could polish a turd. The commenters are the ones that are buying this polished turd. You are right that it was forced and the analogy to a polished turd is excellent, but just like gold, a worthless rock, it has value because people give it value. 

Once the button runs out, I dont think they would put it in the code for, say, "innitiate the launch sequence" or "send this command to that specific server." That would give it away. There is probably something monitoring it or one of the mods will do something once it runs out. To say that "because the code doesnt give it away, then nothing will happen," is a little bit jumpy. 

And how is the button not emotional? The factions wouldnt have formed if someone didnt feel anything about it. Yea we cant vent the same amount of steam as running 4 miles during a soccer game would allow us to, but we still get to vent some. The small victory we get from watching the button survive another day is something. The arguments like this are small football games we play with each other. 

You keep saying that the button is not as great as life or sports, and I already said the analogies are stretching on my side, sure. Yea the button is not the next great sport we will watch on payperview, but that doesnt mean that the elements are not there. That doesnt mean that the small victory of a small three pointer is meaningless. You called it meaningless and im saying it isnt. Yea there are way better things we could use as stimuli, but there are also worse. 

The button isnt the "next best thing," but it is still "a thing."  




 Wtf seriously?  




 You are right that the comparison to life is a gross oversimplification, but I dont agree that the button brings nothing. It brings the excitement of the unknown after the inevitable end when it reaches 0. It brings the conversations like this. It brings the ability to waste time. While it is not as rich as life or other subs in the stimulus it could bring, it still brings some. 

The factions that formed and the monitoring and stats that people collect is like a sport. You could argue that basketball or soccer is pointless. You chase ball around trying to complete a menial task like putting something in a net or pressing something. All for what? To affect a counter? And we do it over and over again and people devote their lives to it? People get so good at it we pay them millions to do it. 

While button pressing doesnt require the skill of a pro athlete, back in the day sports werent as organized or at the high level we are now. The button is like the birth of a new sport or religion and its still forced, disorganized, and sloppy. It looks pointless from the outside like it looks pointless for 22 guys to run around with a ball. 

The beauty of this all is that it shows that humans can take nothing and make a sport out of it. In the quest for entertainment, we can formalize any simple task and make rules and follow it all seriously like we have the button. Beerpong, football, hopscotch,  writing, are all simple tasks that we make complex rules (or in some cases not so complex) and follow and play professionally or at an amateur level just for entertainment. And beautiful things come out of it. 

The slight bit of adrenaline that we get from pressing the button is comparable to the adrenaline from racing. The competive nature that came out when factions formed is not unlike fans following different teams. 

Life can provide many stimuli, and the button is one of them.  




 Who is to decide what has a point? The point of a thing is the reason its users give it. You could attempt to use the same logic to diminish cell phones, the internet, or life itself. 

What is the point of life? We are born cold, crying and naked, then the majority of us struggle every day, and we all die in the end. The whole process would be much easier if we all died now in the same way that the button would be much easier if we all ignored it. 

But what is the fun in that?

I keep working a 9-5 and doing what I do, despite the inevitably of it all, because occasionally I derive pleasure from the flowers or from the sun or from my frend's laughter. We continue to come to the sub because we derive pleasure from the mindless clicking and the community and factions and inside jokes.

I respect your opinion even though I disagree and I do think it is awesome that you are sticking around and replying even though everyone agrees with you. But the button and its pointlessness is an extension of reddit and its pointlessness, and of the pointless inevitable nature of life in general. 

If anything, this discussion has made me realize how much deeper the button really is.  




 And there are a bunch of people that enjoy this site without the button. Whats the point? 

Some people enjoy being karmawhores, and some people enjoy pressing buttons. The preference of others (on how they enjoy a site) does not diminish the way other people use the site (especially when so many use it in those ways). 




 I completely agree with you. I changed the post into a karma copypasta in my other reply to show how OP's ideas can relate to anything. Im from the United states so let me drop another example. When we were a young colony, everyone laughed at the rebellion and the "cute little colony" actin' up. You could say it wasnt a real thing, it certainly wasnt a "real" country yet. But in a way it was a thing because the group of people, the founding fathers, everyone that lived here, wanted it to be a real thing. They made their own laws, own states, own rules and traditions. And after a while it became a thing. 

We make new subs all the time. The need to belong aside, a sub isnt any less of a sub than a default because it is new. If there is a community that contributes, then it is a real thing. A "circlejerk" isnt any less real because it is a circle jerk. However rushed or forced it may be, close to a million random people have come together to press the button, and millions more have come to form a community and everything that comes with it. 

The factions and silly politics, if anything, reinforce how much of a "thing" the button really is. 
 




 
Why do we care about the karma at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this site is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 600k subs and a counter. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?

(btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)

I have watched this site ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole site isn't *nothing* but a joke, the users have definitely turned this site into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the karma. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of linkers/commenters and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.

This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and karma is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a counter. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.

Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this site was probably inspired by that.

 But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this site beyond literally watching a counter. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/subs. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun getting karma was.

Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this site can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many subs and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless? 

This whole site is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over shitposting the new queue. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that linkers's are better than commenters's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny". 

This whole site, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that commenters don't hate linkers (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy karmawhore" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy karmawhore" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This site is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this site at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of the internet, people had a reason to go on the internet that was much greater than simply bashing the other shitposters.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This site's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**

 I remembered it being only 1 so I looked it up. Its dimensions are 24,00040,000 km east-to-west and 12,00014,000 km north-to-south. Earths Diameter is about 12.7k km so I probably remembered that it was 1 in the North to South direction. Two to three can fit overall as you said. Also, if words alone dont make you feel small, check out [this comparison]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Jupiter%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg/1280px-Jupiter%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg )

Also kinsmed is right that it is decreasing in size.   
At the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it was 40,000 km in diameter.

 Mike drove out there and he is dead now 




 Hmm, checks out 



















 That mike guy lol 




  almost all

and I never said I wasn't obsessed with anything, I was just pointing out the hypocrisy of calling out someone for being obsessed with the button. 




 Im not saying that, im saying that it already popped out. Once it is there, they can either choose to have mods or not have mods. If they dont have mods, they dont make more money. If they do have mods they can make money, and deserve to too. But should they get greedy on that money? Even if they ask for 1%, they will still make more money than before. I dont know where the line should be, but the issue everyone has is that 45% for bethesda is a little bit past the line, wherever the line may be. Especially for something that adds to their game.  




 Does that mean its fair though? Yea they bring a lot to the table for a modder, but do they bring in 75%? I dont think so. Yea sure they deserve a cut, im not saying the modders should get 100%, but dont be greedy with it. Especially since at the point that the mods are made, valve takes on no more risk. The platform and game are already made at that point. The mod is just like icing on the cake. Valve isnt putting in any dev risk, any time, or any money into bringing mods out. Other than what they already do. 




 Automod deleted trolla's comments because the cruel humans programmed him to remove any reddot/facebook/twitter links. He was just doing his job and got hate for it.

 Similar to gold, it is in the ground. People dig it up, crush the rocks it is found in and collect it. Only a few countries do it. Once it has been collected, some other guys make sure it is pure enough and that it has the right amounts of the right isotope. Once that is done, they form it into pellets and ship it off to the power plants.

I look forward to the day when all bots are treated this fairly.  









 But at that voltage, taking into account the resistance of human flesh, not much current will get to you. 

When they talk about amps on batteries, they mean the max amp draw or they say amp-hours which is a measure of capacity. 

A circuit will draw the amount of current it needs. A gigaohm resistor will not draw much current, but a motor (which is basically a wire coiled up) will draw a lot more. Your flesh has a very high resistance that varies with humidity and other factors,  and if the voltage isnt too high, you wont get that much current through you. Its not like the battery just forces 30A into everything it gets connected to.

 Not unpopular at gay bars 





























 I think thats a lovely thought. Throughout the history of the universe, everything conspired against the collection of atoms that became you. How improbable is it that this galaxy would form the way that it did, and the solar system, and earth, and the continents. How improbable is it that we would all evolve. That your parents would meet. That they would have a kid. And of billions of sperm, the one that resulted in you is the one that made it. And we get to have our blip of time in the universe before dying and going back to starstuff to wait for the inevitability of the violent death, or not so violent death, of the universe. The earth will fall into the dying sun and the dead sun may be swallowed by a black hole and any mark of humans will be gone forever. Even if any other life exists out there, they wont know about us probably.

But through all that and before the inevitable,  we get to be here today to share this random moment on the internet. We get to live our share of a half dozen decades and make friends and have experiences and be happy and sad and feel. 

I think its rather lovely that we get to ponder our existence, for however brief the moment may be.
