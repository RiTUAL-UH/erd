 The author criticizes equating the term 'democratization' with the recent trends in technology or the economy, but the great majority of humanity are much more empowered as consumers than as citizens. A democratic vote was unlikely to have lowered the Confederate flag in S. Carolina, but the prospect of losing a sliver of market share sent Walmart, Amazon, and even Nascar, scurrying into opposition. The Chinese juggernaut does not promise civil rights, it promises more personal consumption, and from this derives legitimacy. Halting the destruction of the biosphere will require both extracting fewer resources and directing much of this into projects of remediation -- the shopping spree must end. This will require a command economy, which is fundamentally in opposition to personal freedom. Will a democratic majority ever freely choose this radical pathway to survival?   
 




 Perhaps. the Singularity is already here, and arrived centuries ago, with the emergence of a global civilization. Certainly, all the indicators -- population, resource use, accumulated knowledge -- have been increasing at an accelerating exponential rate for some time. The super-organism has only evolved from primitive to complex; a paper postal system to the telegraph to the internet, is analogous to the evolution of the senses, from taste to sight.
 
However, as the late Garrett Hardin observed, in the physical world, the longer an exponential process has existed, the less likely it is to continue. Trees do not grow into the stratosphere; collapse can be expected, may be imminent. This is all the more likely because this present Singularity is very stupid super-intelligence. It appears to be running Bostrom's (sic) runaway paper clip factory, relentlessly converting the biosphere and the Earth's crust into Facebook pages and frequent flyer miles.
 




  I saw the film first, and this detracted nothing from my reading of the novel. Burgess offers a darkly comic satire that questions the basis of human morality and how society responds to deviance. Kubrick (as usual) makes a masterful adaptation and despite the passage of forty-odd years, the cinematography, the costumes and sets still evoke a 'future' to me. As to the original ending to the novel, the missing twenty-first chapter, that was deleted from the American edition. I have not read this ending, but from description, I think it would undercut the central point of the story, and would certainly diminish its delightfully cynical conclusion. Its removal, by the American publisher and then by Kubrick, shows the value added by a good editor.  




 Fasterfind is right. Congress is the equivalent of NCAA basketball or football -- it is farming system for future corporate lobbyists.  Likewise, the executive branch is staffed by lobbyists, who can revolve from the Treasury Dept. to Wall Street with ease. The President is Chief Lobbyist, but must collect his commissions on the backside, as gratuities disguised as 'speaking fees'. Every bright-eyed candidate for student body president is now seeking this ultimate goal. It is the consolation prize that motivates fifteen dwarfs to run for a pair of slots on a Republican ticket, and Donald Trump will work this angle against them. Trump's wealth makes him the only candidate not for hire, and that best illustrates the depth of our corruption.  









 The financial media are propagandists and carnival shills for the plutocracy. The Greek financial crisis has been given emphasis to promote the imposition of continuing austerity on other distressed social welfare states. In contrast, the approaching Chinese debacle must be ignored, until key players can hedge their losses ahead of the market collapse. 




 While I agree that nuclear power has never made sense from the EIEO perspective, 438 nuclear plants currently exist and 67 are under construction. Most of the existing reactors are rapidly aging, and governments will incur enormous legacy costs in decommissioning these and disposing of the waste. Debt-burdened, energy-hungry societies are unlikely to meet this challenge, and I believe there is significant danger of a string of Fukushima level events, will can only accelerate the general collapse. Framed in this context, I would think that the Fukushima debacle would be an appropriate topic for debate for this subreddit. In appreciation of the value of this site, I thank you.
