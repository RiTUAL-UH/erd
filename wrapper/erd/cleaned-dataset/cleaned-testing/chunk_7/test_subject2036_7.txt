 Hey guy/gal. Are you at uni? Also try, "Mindfulness by Mark Williams". Its an audiobook about meditation. I think it will help you A LOT more than yoga and it actually gets prescribed to people with anxiety and depression. The last few chapters are the actual meditations themselves but listen to the whole beginning of the audiobook as it really teaches you why you are feeling bad etc... It's really good!  




 Did you watch any yet? Thoughts?  




 I just want to say that a lot of people on this subreddit make a post stating how awful they are feeling and how they feel like they are never going to get better. I'd just like to point out that you deserve a congratulations for even posting about your current problems! Discussing something that a lot of people really don't want to talk about because you want to get it fixed is a first step in itself and something to be proud of! You aren't just lying idly and not attempting to get it solved. You are actually reaching out and putting in work despite feeling so awful. That is honestly one of the most motivating, beautiful things. Literally just saying "fuck you" to anxiety and speaking about it, talking about it, getting help.

So to all those who post asking what they can do to get happy or un-anxious again I just wanted to say that you already started doing it :) Love you all  




 Also you're brave. You had the nerve to actually talk about something that makes you feel horrifically awful and nearly gives you panic attacks instead of burying it into your conscious!  




 Also, don't say you want to die. There is so much to live for. You are not back at square one and you can be happy with people. But in order to love others you have to love yourself! Write down (pen on paper) everything that you are proud of doing in a big list. Seriously don't not bother. Just do it. Write down everything you are proud of and that you like about yourself then read it.  I can already think of the first thing for your list. You care. Saying things like "I don't deserve happiness" show that you are a human being who cares that they might have upset others and that's so good because there are so many people who don't.  




 I've read your post history and you are not at all a horrible person. The problem is, people compare their behind the scenes to other peoples highlight reels. You are a completely normal human being. You are not terrible despite what you think of yourself. I also often consider myself a bad person inside but I say fuck it - As batman said "It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me"

Your "mistakes" are utterly minuscule and you need to learn to love yourself no matter what :) 




 I'm sorry but there is no way in hell she had anxiety for 2 years and just "learned how to turn it off". This person is toxic to you and you should not let her make you feel bad. You should confront her and tell her that anxiety is a serious illness and if she can't accept you for who you are then she can leave. It may be hard, but in general, ridding yourself of toxic people will make you so much happier in the long run. You need a firm base of supportive and loving people behind you to help you improve and get better. I'm really sorry that this person has said these things to you and I love you :) If you need to talk I'm here :) 




 Hey! Internet hug :) I'm sorry you feel bad at the moment but one bad episode is not a "setback". You aren't at all back at square one. Just because you have a few bumps on the road up doesn't mean you are going backwards. With all progress you will get "setbacks" where you feel everything has been undone but it simply hasn't. You have a week of success and then one anxious night. Thats a good ratio and something to be proud of :) 




 It's actually terrifying to imagine you are trying to escape and this dude just spots you and manages to get to your boat at the speed of light. 




 That was quite beautiful.  




 Yaaay! I'm so happy :)
