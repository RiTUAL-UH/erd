 Because using blankets would take away the integrity of it being a pillow fort. As soon as they used blankets, it would no longer be a pillow fort, it would be a blanket and pillow fort, and thats not what they set out to do. Abed was just keeping with their original objective.

 Ok, say Artist C releases a track featuring the vocals of Artist E, and Artist D plays that track at a live show; and that live show is broadcast over satellite radio, and also made available for download later. How does that work? 




 Running [Windows 7](http://imgur.com/gDygYT2), using Adobe Media Encoder. Whenever I bring in an AfterEffects composition and render out a Quicktime file using the H.264 codec at 720p, it works fine. The problem is occurring when I try to render it out at 1080p. The render fails as soon as it starts, and the Error Log simply says "Error compiling movie. Unknown error." Why is this happening, and what can I do to fix it? 




 You know if your IT guy does see this, you have to tell us what happens :) 




 Ok, am I the only one who's tired of girls like this "oh, i'm curious whether or not I look good." Girl, please, you know you look amazing! Don't act like you don't know that your eyes are impossibly stunning, or your face isn't unbelievably beautiful, and don't even get me started on that smile, casue I honestly, can't even find the words. And then you top it off with a body picture, that honestly, looks like you belong in a magazine. The only negative thing I can say is that you're too perfect, but that's just being petty at this point, lol. 




 You are gorgeous. You have an infectious smile, and from what I can tell, your body looks amazing. If anything, you look even cuter post-preggo. 




 You are absolutely stunning! I love your eyes. You make me feel more beautiful just by looking at you C: 




 You don't have to tell me twice.
