 Watch the skilled hunter as he sits around all day drinking beer - waiting for his prey to walk right up to him. 




 I will be forever pissed that Gina Carano was not cast as Wonder Woman. 




 In 2011 he claimed to be making quite a bit of money off of tourists with his movies:

 Oh, for Pete's sake! 




 Surely that's Shinji-flavored yogurt. 




 I'll have what she's having. 




 Seriously.  The man is at a bar downtown.  Let him enjoy himself in peace.  




 To additionally try and quell your disbelief of my story: This was 20 some-odd years ago.  IIRC, ferries out of Hyannis (to Nantucket Island) were halted because of ~20ft swells.  However,  Nantucket Airlines (think the TV show "Wings") was still willing to fly.  The dual prop -as I remember it- sat ~6-8 people behind the 'cockpit' seats.  It was an open cabin, and you could elect to sit up-front next to the pilot if you wanted to.  There was no divider of any kind.  I had never been in an airplane like it before (or since), so I opted to do it (no one else wanted to).  It was fascinating, but I had no idea what I was in for, and had no idea just how precarious the weather in the sky really was.  It scared the crap out of me at the time.  The pilot told me not to touch anything, but I totally had a steering wheel-like device floating back and forth in front of me - doing all the same movements as the pilots one.

Nantucket was awesome.  The weather cleared the following day, and I lived  delusionally like a king for about a week, playing about in the vicinity of some ridiculously rich people.

Bonus story you can choose to believe or not:  Don't disturb nesting seagulls out in Coatue refuge.  They will dive bomb/shit on you!  I got chased down a beach for about a quarter mile before they stopped trying to shit bomb me.  Running top-speed in soft sand dunes is a real PITA.

I didn't know I invaded their space, but they sure didn't care.  I wouldn't even know if you can still go out there like I did back then, but at the time you could take any vehicle out there that had ....  "dunes pass"?  or something like that.  The rich people I was a guest of had one on their old beat-up Jeep Cherokee, and so I went out there at their suggestion.  Note: You have to heavily deflate your tires or you *will* get stuck out there.   I got stuck twice and had to keep deflating as well as use wood blanks that were in the back/trunk (it seemed like excessive deflation, but it was eventually the only thing that worked).  The entry to the dunes/refuge areas had air pumps (and deflation/pressure guages) for [de/re]-inflating your tires when you got went in/out.  Totally weird for a "city boy" like me, but it was an awesome adventure.

I dont know if the above is still possible, but it was absolutely true ~20 years ago.  I took the ferry back to Hyannis when it was over. 




 I absolutely did, flying to Nantucket Island.  I am originally from Massachusetts, which you can confirm in my post history. 




 Ahh...  I've looked through your history in order to understand just WTF you are implying here.  You're a white LGBT - so you catch shit from white guys who think your cute and it fries their brains that you don't like them back.  I'm guessing you prolly dont get it so much from black guys, because race.  I dunno your locale, so I'm just making generalizations.

I was tempted to /r/shittytumblrgifs you and -1, but I totally understand what you mean now.  You prolly wanna move once you are old enough. 




 Its definitely a lifetime memory.  I wont knowingly do something like that again, but it was a very unique experience that I dont hate having. 




 Yes!  :-) 




 Holy crap it is...  Are the source of dad jokes, Canadian humor?

 As a TV watcher, I agree with these statements.  

*DUN DUN...* 




 I didn't know we had a grind. I thought we were an autonomous collective. 




 I took-off in a small dual-prop aircraft in high-winds once.  As soon as the wheel lost tracktion with the runway, we were pushed sideways about 30 feet.  The entire flight (to an island) we had to fly with heavy skew? into the wind to fight the push.  Being a small plane, it felt like we were flying at a 45 degree angle the entire time.  Bonus: Being a small plane, I had the luck of getting to sit up-front with the pilot and got to see everything that was going on really well, and the fight that the pilot had with the plane the entire time.

You can imagine what the landing was like...   coming in, pointing away from the runway at an angle to fight the wind - but moving straight toward it - and really fast.  The pilot wanted ground asap.  As soon as the wheels get traction, the plain swings abruptly straight - like you just got... umm...  I really cant compare it to anything else.  It was the oddest sensation of a big shove with a straighten your shit out attitude attached from mothernature. It was fucking terrifying.

I will never fly under those circumstances again. 




 With love we'll find a way, just give it time

 People continue to do dick-move things in public as long as it continues to go unconfronted.  This is a learning moment for the driver.  An expensive lesson, but I'm willing to bet that this parking behavior (and associated/contributing behaviors) have been escalating for quite some time - So its an accumulated cheque that the drivers' ass needed to cash.

 Attacking someone that is holding a baby *is mental*.  I dunno what other instances of "mental" you are referring to, but this is surely a just label in this case. 




 The front (and the spine) amazingly say both. 




 I've told Waze they are going to get someone killed for that crap, but they done care.

 There is more than one "heart lake". This one is closer to Mt Shasta City than the one you are thinking of.  




 How slow do you read?? 




 No, it's the story of a boy who has to rescue his father, who's a pilot that's been taken captive by a militant Islamic country.
 




 Oh, insultingly defensive!  Yay! 

a) yah, I know.

b) sure, and I question all the other ones that look like colorized horizon glow as well.

c) If you want be anal, its facing East-North East.  A glow is always there in that direction at night.  Been there plenty of times, and I confirmed via a map before I made reference.

d) yay wide-angle lens.  

e) nice.  you fuck you mom with that mouth? 




 I never knew an expression could so completely represent your own name.

 I call bullshit.  Thats just glow-light from Beaver March State Airport, and/or some other small grouping along the 97.

edit: that picture isnt even facing north - its facing east across Wizard Island.  There is always a glow to the east. 




 You turn a TV "on".  When you are looking at it, you are watching images that are displayed *on* the surface of it.

You go "in" a movie theater.  The things you watch and the people acting the parts are *in*side.

 I couldn't find an example online, but they've been showing it on some LA news stations.  The stupidity of some people continues to surprise. 




 That was truly fascinating. 




 Did you see the photos of the dillhole that used them on Thunder Mountain?   




 In that respect, can you image if it was set in our current day?  He would have bragged about it on facebook, and would have been arrested the next day.

 Where can you get a Pho "kit" like this?  I've made it from scratch, and it was a [delicious] pain in the ass! 




 The point, if you cared to try to comprehend it, is that internet access does not "permeate~~s~~ every aspect of American human existence".

Your statement is incorrect, and I pointed that out. 




 I know its an exaggeration of the split-toe design of certain Japanese footwear - but the spacing of the gap is absolutely ridiculous. 




 My comment was specifically to the absurdity of simply getting internet access via McDonald's.  




 That toe gap must hurt.  




 Someone call Q-Tip to come and educate the post 90's masses about "buggin' out" 




 This is the best misquote since amber lamps! 




 You don't, because it sucks to be you. *That's the American way!* 




 Do you realize that some people live hundreds of miles from a McDonald's?  Try driving across the US sometime. It will give you a completely different perspective on how "we" live. It can be very different from what you believe is normal and average.  




 Because #7.  I know, it sucks, but rules.

 I'll never understand these passive agressive posts.  If there is an open seat next to you, would you not put you bag on it instead of the floor or your lap?

As an adult, I would expect other adults to be fully capable of asking me to move my belongings - for which I happily would.  If I saw a child or an elderly person, I would move them myself and invite said person to sit.

 I visited the site of a Japanese "volunteer" internment camp in the eastern sierras of California last week. Took the tour. Prayed for the dead at the monument. 

There were no confederate flags present in a past or present tense at that site. Just good 'ol freebie.  




 So, good things were done under the confederate battle flag? 




 This goes to show how narrow the roads are.  If there arent lanes, then it is a very fucking narrow road.  There are many CA mountain roads do not have lanes.  Many dont have lines.  It all depends on how remote you go.

These bike riders are idiots driving at those speeds on such a narrow mountain pass. 




 Is it possible that someone watched an episode ahead of you, and then re-marked it as unwatched? 




 I think thats based on what was watched *last*.

 I guess that depends on your definition of the word "can", because these fuckers call my cell phone a couple of times a month. 




 1) I just searched through the script, and could not find a match to your recollection of the dialogue between Kirk and Scotty.  However, I did find a match to the dialogue that /u/derf82 quoted.

 Riders like this drive me crazy. All the time driving near the center line instead of the center of their lane. Constantly lane cutting. Constantly doing stupid things to get around traffic instead of behaving like a proper motor vehicle.
