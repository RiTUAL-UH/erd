 Can't tell if troll or not.

 Ctrl+alt+del man. Just do it. 




 Nice, it'll be fun to see how things pan out over such a huge period of time when a force as powerful as human player messes everything up. 




 Is there a converter from Vicky2 to HOI III? If so, are you gonna be continuing it? 




 "Dies a sickly infant" 




 That's what I thought too. But I also thought it was a bit different from what Teddy had. 




 Thanks!

 Thanks. I'm using it now and it's working out. 




 Yes, I am in the shuttered palace, do I need to be in the empress's court for that option? Or will the Duchess court work? 




 Right now I'm playing a rather persuasive gentleman and I have recently outgrown the minor poet occupation. I checked a few wiki articles and found the career branch I would like to follow is the journalist route.

To gain access to this route you must receive a random event that gives you access to this. To acquire this even you must have a certain amount of Connected:Bohemian, however, I lack the right connections. Is there any way to quickly gain Connected: Bohemian? If so, what is it? 




 I'm pretty sure my dad's old copy of the Hobbit has this design, though it's not in as good of condition. Is it worth a lot? (I would never sell it, I'm just curious). 




 This is a super great game! Just out of curiosity, is there a Fallen London or failbettergames Subreddit? 









 thank mr skeltal 




 Note: This is post not meant to dishonor Misao Okawa, previously the oldest woman on earth in any way. This post is simply to inform all of my fine fellow Americans that one of our own now holds the position. 














 I Think the reason why so many Americans, as well as myself, are against the idea of paying the tax because it's non-optional and it's very likely it won't benefit you.

Think about it, if you're a young American who has no real health problems and rarely needs to go to the doctor then why would you want to pay for a service you're most likely never going to need? Or even worse, if you're someone who is struggling to get by paying for things like rent or food, then how are you going to survive when you're now being forced to pay for health insurance?

And then there's the fact that people who have health insurance would never want to switch to national healthcare, think of these peoples mentality's, it goes from "I make money and i'm successful so I can ensure that if I ever get hurt I'll get proper medical care" to "I make money and i'm successful so now I have to pay for other people to get medical care.

Really I think you just need to look at it from all the perspectives you can think of and realize that to a lot of them national healthcare is unappealing and it's not just them being evil and mean. 




 Is there a mirror anywhere? The original was deleted. 




 Most likely a troll. 









 Sounds like it'd go perfect with [Vagina bacon](http://www.reddit.com/r/popping/comments/yoibk/this_may_not_be_the_appropriate_place_but_i/c5xta25) 




 Are the valve controllers still supposed to have haptic feedback? I remember back when they were first announced that they would, but then I feel like later on they said they wouldn't. Sorry, I haven't followed the news about these things much but I'd like to know.

 And thus, in the fires of war, surrounded on all sides by a pervasive blue menace the two nations stood together as brothers in arms. Together, through the mingling of bloodlines these nations came to rely on each other, and so a new union was formed in mainland Europe, one that would make its enemies shudder with fear from the mere utterance of it.

 [IT'S HAPPENING.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ron-Paul_Its-Happening1.gif) 




 Hey guys, so I just fucked up a few minutes ago, lemme explain.

It's 2 in the morning and i'm 16, I have my own room and laptop, it's a simple laptop, a chromebook, but it does what I need it to do. However, I'm also a heavy listener of music and as such have a nice pair of over the ear headphones. So i come into my room, I had just gotten back from using the bathroom after trying to fall asleep for the past four hours, but try as I might I can't sleep.

As I come back into my room I decide that sleep isn't happening so I instead opt to go to grab my computer and surf the web. I begin surfing and after a while I decide to put on some music, I check to make sure my headset is plugged in. Now, my headset has two plugs a USB and an audio/mic cable. I can feel that it's plugged into the USB port but the audio cable isn't plugged in so I quickly fix that, however my chromebook only has one input that works as either a mic port or an audio out port.

I plug in the audio cable, not really looking, and pull up [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwmYAdgU18) The song starts up and I notice it's a bit quiet, so I bump up the volume on my chromebook until it's at full volume, at this point it's listenable and I'm pleasantly rocking out. About 2 minutes later my dad bursts into the room, yelling at the top of his lungs about how he has work tomorrow and I need to turn that down immediately.

I'm confused for a moment before I look down and notice that... My mic cable was plugged in instead of my audio out cable.
Since I had noise cancelling headphones I hadn't noticed them yelling at me to turn it off, and I hadn't noticed that it was so quiet even at max volume because I had those on...

TL;DR: Mix up mic input and audio output cables for my headset and end up blasting Rock music at full volume at 2:00 in the morning. 




 No, but the plague has already swept across those lands and turned the french into inhuman monsters which are massive bloated walking corpses... These monsters are known only as blobs... 




 For the same reason people pay comedians or buy movies. Entertainment. True, donating $1000 is a really stupid idea but donating something more like $10 is a good way of supporting someone who produces media that you consume for entertainment. 




 (Might not have actually looked like this. But then again, it may have.) 









 Lol wut. 




 I figured what I was doing wrong. Fixed

 If you have any more keys I'd love to play this great looking game! 




 So, I'm making my first map and when I upload it it get's all glitchy. I checked online on how to make borders and it showed them using the division, whereas when I drew it I drew the borders of every province without using division in inkscape. Does this mean I did it wrong and have to re-do the whole thing using the division method, or is there a way I can salvage my map?

BTW. From what I can figure, the problem is that in Inkscape the borders for all the objects overlap, creating problems with the borders. 









 Sabaton. Especially with the real world maps. Songs like "what is the price of a mile" really get you in the WWI spirit.
