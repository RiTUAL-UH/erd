 Seriously though :( 




 Collin Cowgill 




 Fair enough; I assumed we were talking career paths since we were talking about Hoiberg and what not. But you're definitely right in that regard. 




 At least 95% of these college coaches aren't gonna go coach internationally; so for all intents and purposes, they'd jump straight to the NBA from college. Those are the only steps for them. 




 Ah, interesting. Why not? 




 Doesn't the way the Big 12 football TV contract is scheduled make it almost impossible for people to leave? I thought it was something like the conference keeps your share of the TV money from wherever you move to if you leave. 




 I stand corrected on that point, then. Thanks for the research and legwork, have an upvote! Although I think our attendance numbers are somewhat inflated by the fact that we do draw quite a few fans of visiting teams, mostly because SoCal is damn nice to visit. We still draw really well.

Still don't think Arte is a great owner, but I will limit my opinions to the baseball side of things.
 




 Holy shit dude. Slow your roll on the sweeping generalizations. 




 I could be wrong, read somewhere that the prices had gone up. Admittedly I don't remember what the prices have always been.

And yeah, parking is cheap there for sure comparatively. The point I was making is that the savings in beer prices was redistributed elsewhere. Which I'm doubting now. 




 Nice! He was a really good fourth outfielder for us, we only let him go cuz of some wonky call-up stuff we had to do with our bullpen. Glad he's playing well 




 How is JB for you guys? Is he getting playing time? Miss him out here. 




 Angels fans are at best sharply divided about Moreno. He was the reason we signed Hamilton after telling Torii Hunter (who was beloved here) that we didn't have the money to resign him. He went over the head of our GM to do so, who was pretty frustrated by it. He was also the reason we ran Hamilton out of town for nothing.

We do appreciate his willingness to (EDIT: spend to) win, but the beer price thing was largely a sham. Dropped beer prices and raised parking prices in one swoop haha (EDIT: this point is largely proven wrong below, just don't want to delete it for purposes of continuity/not hiding my mistakes haha). 




 As well you should, like I said, wasn't trying to say anyone has unrealistic expectations or anything. I just saw some comments wondering how they were doing it, and the cluster luck seems to be a strong contender for explaining it. 




 I love Logan Forsythe. I live in San Diego, so I go to a fair number of Padres games, and he was always my favorite player on the team. Can't really explain why. He was just awesome. Seemed like he did [stuff like this all the time](http://m.mlb.com/video/v22051069/?game_pk=318560) (he hit a walkoff HR in that game too). Love seeing him thrive for you guys. 




 Despite Tim McCarver's failings, I will always be impressed with the way he called exactly what was gonna happen. 




 Gotta be the last day of the 2011 season. [For reference, or just rewatch it again because it's amazing.](http://m.mlb.com/video/v19789807/?query=2011%2Bgame%2B162) 




 This is why you always stay til the end. That's so awesome haha 




 I do! This is an awesome streak 




 I stand corrected 




 First off, not trying to hate, I love that the Twins are playing so well! So fun to see newfound success, especially in the Central, where it's been death, taxes, and the Tigers for what seems like forever now (I know it hasn't I know).

That being said, [this might have something to do with the Twins' success](http://thepowerrank.com/cluster-luck/). 12 runs luckier than the next luckiest team in MLB via cluster luck. 




 It is because it's not on the schedule until it's necessary. The equivalent of what you're saying is what happened with Oakland and Texas a couple years ago, where they played Game 162 tied atop the AL West. 




 Absolutely perfect throw too. Only way they throw him out there. Hell of a play. 




 Point taken, I see what you're saying. You'll never hear me dismiss the value of semantics in arguments haha, don't know why that became a thing. Semantics are important.

Definitely agree that it's the obvious place to upgrade if we're going to do so. I just don't think the situation is as dire as many are making it out to be because the team as a whole has been extraordinarily unlucky so far. 

We're 29th in the league in BABIP, 1 point ahead of Boston (who was like 10 points behind us before we played them this past weekend, and they got lucky against us haha). We're hitting the ball well, it's just not getting down for some reason. 

We're also 26th in the league in defensive cluster luck (poor Oakland is in last, with luck three times as bad as ours defensively). The fact that we're still pitching pretty well is also extremely encouraging.

The fact that we're still around .500 is pretty great with regards to the luck we've had. I have faith it'll turn around, and when it does, we'll be a pretty good ballclub. 




 He's never really hit for a high average; his value is his on-base ability. He will be a useful player come season-end. His failings right now are just more noticeable because almost the entire team is struggling. 




 Is he gonna help at all? 




 When Shoe keeps the ball down, he's very good. When he doesn't, we get most of this season.

Also that Chapman fastball. Yeesch 




  one of those ~~series~~ **years**, so far

FTFY.

Seriously, we're ripping the ball in the past few weeks. Nothing is getting down. 29th in MLB in BABIP, one point ahead of Boston, who was like 20 points below us before our weekend series against them when they took away like 17 hits and had 28 slow rollers get through in the Sunday game alone

Yes I'm a little frustrated 




 They're both fine where they are thank you. Stay over there, play with your own toys 




 That's my favorite spelling of melodramatic ever 




 Guys wait :( 




 I mean it's technically correct breh 




 Apostrophe bruh 




 Well I was just watching Moneyball on my flight and it happens in the movie

EDIT: so obviously all the time /s 




 *The Palm at the End of the Mind* by Wallace Stevens is great. Any Coleman Barks translation of Rumi is awesome too. 




 I agree 100%. Those ITT suggesting that we'd be willing to part with Heaney for this kind of player don't have a sense of what the organization's trajectory is, or how hard we worked to get him.

Also, I agree that Joyce will get it going, was just saying what we'd do with Revere if we got him. Joyce probably won't be great, but he can certainly produce and contribute to the team, and I think that's way more valuable than trading for a guy who's decent but not a game-changer. That's what Joyce will be, and we don't have to give up anything to get him; we already have him. 




 We'd likely put him in left instead of Joyce, who has been one of the worst hitters in the league so far. 




 We have a backup DH/1B in CJ Cron. Do you know anything about our team past what you see on ESPN? You're showing a very surface level understanding of the organization. 




 This is a comical idea. 




  more than one pitching prospect

not more than one player. More than one pitching prospect. 




 Revere profiles similarly to Aybar offensively, but with less situational hitting ability. Pretty high average but doesn't draw walks so a middling/below-average OBP. Plus he's not a good defender. He would, however, add another running threat to the order.

Ultimately, I'd want to see what we'd give up. If it's anything of consequence, I'd prefer that we didn't. 




 I'm not saying the deals are equivalent, I'm saying we are unlikely to do it unless it's nearly all paid because of the Hamilton deal. They are different things, and that's why I think a deal is unlikely between the Angels and Phillies. The situations are categorically different, yes, but the Hamilton situation affects what the Angels would be willing to do to bring in Howard (answer: not much). 




 Didn't say it was, but I don't think we'd be willing to part with more than one pitching prospect, we don't have enough. There's a reason the Angels haven't been talked about as a landing spot for Hamels. 




 This is exactly right. The A's this year are the definition of "You can't win a pennant in April, but you can lose it". 




 Yeah we'll probably want even more money. We just got rid of Hamilton and paid almost all of it, we're not trying to bring a contract like that in and pay too. 




 Angels fans seem properly rated. We're nice enough most of the time, but the knowledge of the fan base is really poor. Not to mention the beach balls. Went to Opening Day last year, 10 beach balls got on the field and stopped play. I was cringing of embarrassment. 




 Hahaha. The young pitcher...would be Heaney.  




 Pretty much. Hopefully the offense can progress to the mean and we'll be scary. 




 Angels pitching staff has the best ERA in the AL in May, and third best in the majors. Largely because we've had so many starts of 7+ innings. Which seems like the only way we win because we only have two reliable bullpen arms (Smith and Street, who are both amazing), and our offense isn't outgunning anyone right now. 




 Yeah no way Heaney goes to Philly. Not unless Hamels is coming back. 




 Sosh said almost no one will play all 4 games this series cuz of the turf. 




 Do it after we play the Sox this weekend. Then I'm game. 




 Angels are not taking on that contract unless it's literally almost all paid for, and we don't have to give up anyone who has the ability to make a major league impact. Seriously doubt it. 




 It's not even finally, he's been swinging well for a bit. Nothing is getting down 




 I think my favorite part about this is how he has to look at the base in the last 10 feet and chop his steps to touch it.

I wonder if he would describe his expression after the play as a bemused grin or a knowing chortle. 




 More than a little disappointed. Did the ACC have total control or something? Cuz these are basically piss-off-little-guy games. 




 They were both good this year, and neither is losing very much, although Richmond is losing Kendall Anthony. ODU in particular seems to be on the way up. 




 Ed Cooley, Chris Mack, Archie Miller, Andy Enfield, John Groce, among others, in just skimming the list...it's like a who's who of upcoming coaches. 




 That is a really cool idea. Get the most qualified people jobs. 




 Definitely has something to do with it. The entire Royals staff is quick to the plate, it's something they've cultivated. Perez is also great at controlling the running game.  




 I'm guessing he was reading that for insight into how others saw things, not for his own viewpoint. 




 I read this and initially thought you were talking about Senor Met, which, yeah. 




 Little bit of column A, little bit of column B I think. He does let the ball go really early. 




 I read something last year about how even though Ventura throws as hard as he does, his release makes his velocity much less effective because he throws it further from the plate than a lot of pitchers. As in the ball has further to travel, so even though it's going faster, the batter has more time to react. 




 Negative response bias. 




 This was also the time of the year when the A's were killing everyone in run differential. Something something counting chickens.

EDIT: Wow, gold circle jerk, yay! 




 Hahah that's fair enough. I'd love to see what Cowgill could do with full-time ABs. He was hitting well last year before he took that one to the face. Or even platooning him and Efren
 




 Yeah, he obviously should've known, but if you were ever gonna do it, this would've been the easiest game to not know. 




 Like I said haha. Revere is not that good at all, and Joyce, though not at all a world-beater, is not as bad as he has been.

Knee-jerking and giving up prospects for someone that will provide minus defense and a modest improvement with the bat at best, is foolish and short-sighted. Revere is not worth giving anything up for. 




 Please don't do this. He's not any better than what we have. 




 There is a significant difference between the clusterfuck that is LAX and all of those airports, so yeah, I'll take the field.

"looking at" was a colloquialism, not a literal statement. I understand that you can hear planes from all of those places; I am saying it is not anymore of a nuisance than street traffic as long as you're not right next to it, which no one would've been.

Traffic would've been a concern, yes, but with the time they had to plan it, and the lack of heavy development in the area, I'm confident they could've come up with something workable. As far as environmental costs go, that's just facetious. All of those people who need to fly are gonna fly somewhere; now they're driving to an airport further away and then taking the same flight, so a net increase in the amount of pollution, not a decrease. Unless you were just talking about the Orange County impact, which is both scientifically dubious and again, NIMBY.

Oh, money has a hand in trying to get it built, the difference is that there was also a major social benefit to having an accessible international airport in the area, far larger than that of the "huge swath of grass" that is the Great Park. So the societal benefit is far larger in that case.

And if you're really gonna go there and say that no one who doesn't live in the flight path of the airport deserves to have a say, then stop eating food from the supermarket, drinking water from the tap, using electricity...like seriously. That's not the world we live in. 




 LAX Jr. is a little steep, don't you think? And there would've been an ample buffer between the closest houses and the airport; we largely would've been looking at planes flying overhead, not dealing with the takeoff noise in a game-changing amount.

And, both for Orange County in general and for the rest of southern California and the country at large, yes, you need to make a good amount of money to live in Irvine. And honestly, those of us who live in the area (I am from Irvine originally) and don't make that much money are not the people who got it killed; the people with money did. That's the point I was making with regards to money.

It just reeks of NIMBYism. Sure, fuck someone else over, but don't you dare make me deal with it. 




 Wooo that second one is a pretty hot take. 




 [Blowing an 11 game lead in the division.](http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/107/files/2011/10/1995.jpg) 




 There is no other serious candidate without going back to 95. 




 For sure, didn't read it as a joke, my bad 




 Uhhhhhhh not sure what this has to do with us losing.

If anything I'd think Iannetta being player of the game was a great thing for our chances of winning, since his baseline production has been such a black hole. 




  Awesome, happy to hear it! What would you recommend reading next by him?

My favorite of his was *In A Sunburned Country*, about Australia. Can't really go wrong though. 




 I'd be more impressed if his OBP was higher than the NL average OPS /s

Seriously he's raking right now. 




 The even sadder thing is that they had the political clout to kill it. Dollars talk, sense walks.  




 If you remove the blackouts from MLB.tv, you put MLB.tv directly into competition with the regional networks who currently pay billions of dollars for their exclusive TV rights. Without blackouts, those TV rights are no longer exclusive, and you make them compete against a service that provides exactly what a large proportion of people want from their TV, which is access to the games. The value of those rights deals now plummets, and a huge slice of baseball's revenue has just cratered.

MLB.tv is not drawing in the casual fan. MLB.tv is drawing in the diehards, those of us who follow the sport as a whole, and follow it closely. You're not losing an opportunity to grow/maintain the fanbase by blacking out local games.

It does suck for certain markets, since they lie in the middle of multiple teams' broadcast areas. If anything, that's where we'll see changes. Maybe allow users to select one team at the beginning of the year that they won't be blacked out for or something. Which wouldn't solve everything, but it would help a lot. 




 Not sure it was totally fleshed out, but it would've been on the bigger side. 

I get that, but the demand for flights in and out of the area was and is enough to fill up two airports, given the size of John Wayne and its limited hours.

The airport was killed because rich Irvine/Newport Beach residents didn't want planes flying overhead. Which frankly get over yourselves. 




 The Great Park has already fulfilled its main objective, which was to kill the airport they were planning on putting there. There's no incentive for them to develop it, and that's why it still is what it is. 




 Vinnie just wanted his own earned runs, didn't want Morin to hog them all.

It's okay, plenty of baseball left 




 ..what are you saying?

Well yeah, but viewership only makes sense if it's monetized. Online ads aren't the ticket; they can't even fill the ads up now. 

I know it's anathema on this sub to say the blackout rules are a good idea..but they are.  




 Those policies are not idiotic. They're inconvenient for fans. Those policies make a ton of sense, and as much as I'd like to not have them, it's hard to imagine a world where (to cite the most obvious example) MLB.tv costs as little as it does and doesn't have blackout rules. 




 Really? I don't know much about hockey, so I'll concede that, but the NBA playoffs have not been very good games outside of the Clippers-Spurs series.

EDIT: Okay, people like games with exciting finishes. Doesn't mean those games were well played. 




 Iannetta can still play. He'll come around. 




 I think we'll actually do a better job 




 He packed his Head N Shoulders in his carry on, didn't get through TSA 




 Yeah I figured he'd struggle against you guys a bit. I was hoping for like 4 runs in 5 innings, not 4 runs in 1.2

The real question is, how badly will our offense continue to suck? Cuz it sounds like you guys have been terrible at keeping teams from scoring. Let us help you with that. 




 But seriously, which one of you guys invited 2014 CJ Wilson? Not cool guys. Not cool. 




 He's awesome, we love him
