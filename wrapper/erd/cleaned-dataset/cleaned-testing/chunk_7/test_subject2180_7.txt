 Lmao. Are you positive about that? look up Catherine the great.   




 Not a girl but the biggest instance of me missing a signal from a girl was back in high-school. My little brothers sister(different dads, different moms) no relation outside of my little bro, anyway she randomly started hanging around me whenever she would come over to visit my lil bro, one day while she was spending the night over our house(this was long after my mom and her dad had ended but she was still close to our family) she came to my room, asked me to come into our living-room, i sat next to her, one thing led to another and i lost my virginity that night. 

Anyway a few weeks later, she calls my house, i pick up in she starts talking about how she wants to come over and hangout again and asked could she speak to my mom, my mom and her are on the phone, she ask my mom, mom looks over at me wondering if i want to be bothered i blurt out mom no! because despite the fact we had sex i really could not stand her or her sister, my mom also did not want to be bothered so she made up an excuse in said maybe next time. I later realized what she was hinting at when she said hang out again about 3 months later. F%#$

 




 I don't get it? 




 What's the difference? you act like men give a damn about a woman being a slut. We look for the slutty chicks, that's why we head to the clubs, that's why we dream of nympho's and that's why we like to get chicks wasted. News flash the guy is not interested in your personality, he's interested in those personalitits. 

You think a guy will stay around for the illusion of a blowjob? some might but the probability of an entire town doing so not likely. Calling b.s, op your mom is the town bicycle.  




 Academic*  




 So how long did it take you to realize you were married? 




 lolz facts. 




 Brazil for one. 




 In once again this is why spain,england, france and the rest of these countries with generations of knowledge continuously under-perform compared to countries which came later. Scroll up they did state that. 




 or did you? but yeah interesting.  




 America has 5x the amount of the us? so we're outclassing ourselves goddamn it.   




 Aww he is adorable. https://boxerworld.com/forums/threads/long-hair-boxer.19839/page-2 googled this, one of the comments mention this is traceable back to some uk breeds.  




 Can confirm this guy punches.  




 Then. I looked it up-_- it refers to time. 

Back then is correct back than would be incorrect when we're referring to time. Nope fuck  you're correct, than is used in conjunction with more.  




 Yeah but i'm talking pre-79 




 Ha funnily enough this is my account. In no i'm not using subterfuge, now death to israel!!!! joking i'm a pro-zionist shill:) but i do support the Iranian people, in no i did not leave out the ayatollahs. I thought this was common knowledge they ruined the relationship. 




 Right. Like they did for josh by sending him to a former cop who turned out to be a child molester? lmao these are the side hug people. More then likely they have made them feel like it's their fault.  




 2 of 30..... right. Anyway i'm just saying you should give a better source next time, mainly because i think allot of people would be interested. Start with india and south east asia, they probably have clear cut cases.  




 Not what i feel. What we clearly saw in the interviews, like what you're doing by stating oh it "happened" a long time ago and "why is this even being brought up" etc 




 I don't watch 19 kids and counting yet it still exist until very recently-_- 




 No saying america could not compete because we do not have a century of heritage with kicking a ball with our feet is shitting on America.  




 Um professionally? or are we talking about public popularity? can you link some info. 




 The article clearly referenced male to female and vice versa instances where actors did it in china, also i never said they only did it for entertainment purposes i clearly pointed out various social political purposes and even modern purposes by citing Albanian women in concerns to why people cross-dress but like you stated before crossdressing is not indicative of transgender identity lets leave it at that and not contradict ourselves because i'm not arguing against your points i'm really not.   




 I can go scroll up in point out where you stated this and passed it off as fact."http://www.bilerico.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php If you think being trans is some new fad, please realize trans people have always been a part of humanity and they always will be. History is full of examples of trans people attempting to transition with what society has at hand at the moment. From the Gallai of ancient Rome, to the two spirited people of the America's there is not one culture or time in all of recorded and unrecorded human existence in which trans people did not make up some percentage of the population. The only difference is that now, as is the case with many other medical issues, we have developed appropriate treatments.
When people say "trans isn't real because chromosomes"-

In once again those same feelings and causes that are indicative of transgender identity is can not be discerned from historical figures. Like you pointed out crossdressing is not endemic of being trans-gendered if so jamie fox, martin Lawrence and jim carrey would all be transitioning as we speak. They're many reasons for cross-dressing using examples of this as indicative of a historical presence for trans-gendered is not factual and should not be passed off as such. But like i said i understand where you're coming from, it's how i feel when someone tries to disprove me in concerns to african history. I know my people, i know where we come from and i know that we did not just pop up in chains so sorry once again if this looks like i'm attacking you.  

 




 No one said feel awful but i have a problem with someone downplaying child sexual abuse, especially if they're being what's the legal term in court? led? led to this conclusion and outlook. Most people do or are you a duggar? 




 Damn it i knew you would see the line and misconstrue that, let me reiterate a line can be curved. I am not line biased. No but in all seriousness it's not speculation that is bad or dangerous, it's not even gender or sexuality speculation unless you're catholic in then that may be a problem. Rather or not Lawrence of Arabia was gay,straight,bi or even asexual is a very fond subject of historical biographers, speculation is a big part actually when it comes to biographical portraits of historical figures, the main issue however is when this speculation is passed off as fact.

The thing about biographers is allot of what they write on a person, specifically personality traits and other characteristic's that are not backed by specific writings or other things are all really just speculation when it comes down to it this is the norm. But theirs a difference between presenting something as speculation and presenting something as fact, earlier a poster referenced suicide rates on post op trans and you had at him because obviously this is not factual. The same can be applied to you, i have no problems with speculation but you should clearly label this as speculation of the gender identities in historical figures/people's when citing it for the basis of your statements instead of passing it off as fact. I know this was probably because you're tiredd of transphobes and want to present a strong argument to shut them down but in the long run it might be better so you won't have to deal with anyone attempting to discredit you on the basis of this alone.

 




 Got me there. Because my family cares about my views on those who have suffered from child sexual abuse and have influenced me to this opinion. Thank you jester.  




 I believe to forgive first you must face what occurred, I've never heard of someone being told to forgive a situation when it is still being downplayed and from the interviews the duggar family is really downplaying this or diverting the issue to non relevant topics.  




 Thank you for sharing this. In i understand not from the perspective of an abuse victim but having a number of ex partners who suffered the same abuse, unfortunately even from close family members. Your perspective is not uncommon, my ex felt the same way, she was actually still suffering from the abuse nightly, i did not find this out till later, it took months for me to finally convince she should seek help but she always refused on the basis of "not making a fuss"   she was a very inwardly cold person, extremely guarded when it came to her own personal feelings so i can understand where you're coming from.

She did not want to take any action because she had in her own word built up a wall in concerns to her emotions. I hear this often repeated by those who are victims of rape since it usually is done by someone close to them, how they say they still love the person but at the same time hate them. It's a very confusing place, which is why i have the view that the same viewpoint would be the ones the duggar sisters are having, on the one hand you know what your brother did, but he is still your family. Theirs a documentary i had to watch for a pysch class concerning pedophiles and the children they abused, in one woman said how she still had the urge and inherent need to have her father around who abused her, saying how she felt on certain days after she got a good grade or accomplished something she wished she could call him up in be like dad i got an A.

In you're perfectly fine and from my personal experience your outlook more common then uncommon at-least going by my ex's, allot of times people assume rape victims should be crying, tearful or feeling disgusted in some ways but whenever one of my ex's disclosed this information to me it was either delivered in a matter of fact way or nonchalantly or sometimes just a random w.e to start a conversation. 

I think the only time it was really emotional was when one admitted to herself and me she was being abused, but once again that was when it was still occurring so it can really depend on time and, when the abuse began and stopped, 




 Not you granny. But i have heard from others calling it fluid. In sorry for that then, but you can't decide rather or not my opinion is being nitpicky because sources you're using to validate your statements are not holding up. The point of any source is to be critiqued because this is what you're basing it entirely on. That's very true, in if the concept of gender has progressed and greatly change isn't it wrong to assume our current understanding and view of it is completely null in concerns to historical gender identity?

That's why i referenced the elven crossdresser, what we see as signs of transgenderism, how we view it in that historical and cultural context it can be completely unrelated. The link you posted even states the same at the very bottom. Monks and philosophers actually would not be included but alchemist most definitely, interesting read on the subject of how it was coined  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417

Imagine if they had chosen atheist, god the 1950's would of been hell on earth for the scientific community. You are popularizing futuristic concepts, just dropped the atomic bomb and split the atom a few years before, the world is hypothesizing new concepts while at the same time people scared of commies are forcing god into everything and here you're, the atheist. 

Sorry once again history major here, that's not factual, much like theories in science we can study events, source historical accounts, if need be excavate and then of course compare in theorize based on the available evidence what occurred. History is literally reading between the lines, which is one of the reasons why it's fascinating. The one thing we cannot do to a fault is really the mindset of historical individuals we can surmise their personalities, traits, and how they might of been but this is all really a opinionated guess which is one of the reasons why i dislike when people try in post their mindsets on historical figures and events. Those who do this usually have a political objective, which honestly i do not mind, but be honest about, if you want to lay claim to Alexander the great being homosexual for the purpose of giving a historical figure that gay young adults can look up to fine but their is a a point we should respect.  




 TLC actually used to be extremely educational but like history channel it sold out.  




 Thank you. Lets not ignore this simple fact, their family is extremely on the cult esque spectrum as you can get without expanding into a compound in adding more families.  




 Yes exactly. The same way abuse victims who are still in abusive relationships or environments or people who have been kidnapped in have Stockholm syndrome cannot have mature outlooks on a situation.  




 Now this is confusing. One minute it is fluid and the next it's not, OK so can i call bullshit on people trying to raise their children gender neutral? because this is becoming contradictory. Not using a stand in it was a personal reference to how complex gender and gender is if anything? 

But all the people referenced, like 9 out of ten were cross-dressers your link implied were transgender. Which is why i pointed it out. OK agreed that's usually how history works, my question to you is how can we then state they're categorically transgender, because then you're putting your own cultural bias on it just like how gay people are now putting their bias on historical figures who may or may not be gay.

But the rest of your post was very informative, sorry if this is nitpicky.  




 Duggar is that you? you cannot wish the pedo away like the gay, it does not work like that, it's not 2 for 1 my friend. Normal families would not protect and allow their son to molest his younger sisters or send him to counseling with a a man later convicted of having kiddie porn. They have proven repeatedly that their method was ineffedctive.  




 Duggar? is that? jesus you cannot wish the pedo away like the gays, won't happen.  




 Going to go a little progressive here but. Gender identity is pretty fluid correct? who says it would be that difficult? we know the concept of tomboy exist, it does not mean a woman who is a tomboy or shows characteristics of a man is trans-gendered or wishes to be a man. Caitlin Jenner lived for decades as a man, he was and is sorry she is a Olympian who was considered a perfect specimen of masculinity and athleticism back in his day yet he is transgender. 

I'm going to use a personal reference here, but i was recently playing this game called witcher 3, theirs a quest, involving this elven clothes designer who likes to cross-dress, he is not into men, does not see himself as a woman but explains he likes to dress up, likes to see himself as other roles, other professions of higher or lower social status. Not saying this covers them but it did kind of give me an idea of how fluid it really is and the concepts of self identity, like you stated we really cannot know absolutely in i think that goes both ways.

"In seventh Century BC, King Ashurbanipal (Sardanapalus) of Assyria spent a great deal of time in womens' clothing, something that was later used to justify overthrowing him. In Egypt, 1503 BC, Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut ascended to the throne, the second Egyptian queen to rule (the first was Queen Sobekneferu of the 12th Dynasty). Possibly learning from the disfavor shown to her predecessor, she donned male clothing and a false beard signifying kingship, and reigned until 1482 B.C. She had one daughter, Neferure, who she groomed as successor (male clothing, false beard and all), but Neferure did not live into adulthood. After her death, her second husband attempted to erase all record of her. And Nzinga ruled as King of Angola from 1624 - 1653, cross-dressed and led several successful military battles against the Portuguese.
Read more at" this for instance seems to showcase that this case of cross-dressing was more due to societal norms in which a man was seen as possessing more power then a woman so she chose to use take up dressing as a man to strengthen her authority not as a pure  belief of seeing herself as a man but it was expedient to use the physical attributes. 

Sorry was kind of hoping it would have more depth instead of being moves in response to cultural stigma of being a woman.
