 It seems like it's something that people don't even notice as a serious issue, we need to somehow get governments or the news to talk about it more as it is very serious.

 The same pattern we see in the harshness of life; we can experience incredible pain and misery but if we endure through it we come out of the fog much stronger and more powerful. What was once hated and called evil has been cultivated into something beautiful.

This goes for immoral acts as well.

Quotable Quote
To be defeated and not submit, is victory; to be victorious and rest on one's laurels, is defeat.

It's commonly used to describe people, like you can say that person is resilient or that person is ____

Hi test_subject2183,
I would be happy to help you analyze your practice in order to modify it so that you will quickly come to experience tangible results. In order to do that I will need you to provide more precise information.
When you started practicing about a year ago exactly what did you do? Did you start with 1 hour per day and what was the step by step process you followed? Did you sit for practice once per day or multiple times?
How did your practice change over the year?
In the last month what has your practice been like?
When and where do you sit for practice? How long are your sessions?
Can you describe the session(s) you did yesterday...precisely how did you practice from the moment you took your seat until the alarm sounded at the end?
Have you had any physical injuries or mental/emotional illness challenges in the last few months? Have you begun taking or stopped taking any drugs/medications in the last few months?

Once per day, I would do it in the morning sometimes and sometimes in the evening. I would do it outside sometimes and sometimes inside the houes but mostly outside. No physical injuries or illnesses recently and no drugs or medication.

 Know your limits, boys

 My view is that existentialism in proper practice is one great way to not waste your life. You matter but most things in life do not matter such as politics, money, morals, ethics, superiority, the law, good and evil. As you can see it resembles nietzsche's notions. Those things do matter in some sense but not as much as you. The key is to not rationalize anything.
If you have a vision, create it and don't use any excuses such as money because money is a word used to describe freedom in a capitalist society. Isn't it contradictory and ironic when you are enslaved by freedom? We simplify freedom to money and work hard to get it but we are not daring enough to explore unfamiliar territory of what it truly means to be free and create your own values. We justify money by thinking that we worked hard and deserve it therefore there is no more work to be done. But we are all too familiar with the word "money" and the idea of money; in the same way that if we learn useless facts or be active in politics we are making a difference or we are stimulating ourselves intellectually. I'm not saying they are wrong but do not be enslaved by them, do not master them either but be free of them. How to test freedom? Set a goal and go for it, if you get distracted..get back on task and become great beyond weakness.

 The feeling function is auxiliary. Many of us carry an emotional weight on our mental health. After years of trying to improve my life I found something that changed my life, it resembles Freud's idea of letting people talk about their life, worries, inconveniences and desperation.

Venting. What we do is we add each other on skype via private messaging me; i'll set up a way to get all the contacts and i'll send them to everyone, we have group conversations where we vent or talk about our cluttered lives. Simple.

When I vented for 1 hour non stop I felt energetic, clear minded, powerful, highly disciplined, happy and most importantly; no longer anxious or in despair but powerful and capable.
