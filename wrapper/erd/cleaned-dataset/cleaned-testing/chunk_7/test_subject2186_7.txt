 First, you'll need a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).  I'd suggest downloading [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/), which is a (basically) free software - it has a 60 day free trial, but still works exactly the same after the trial "ends."  I also have [FL Studio](http://www.image-line.com/flstudio/), but I use Reaper to manipulate audio files because I think it's the easier of the two to use for that.

After you have your DAW, find 2 (or more) songs you like!  It helps if they have similar BPM, but that's not a necessity.  A good rule of thumb I use is if they're within 10% of one another (I think I made one with a 128 BPM song and a 140 BPM song).

Download the songs you want to use (in Reaper, .wav files are generally easier to use than .mp3 files, so convert your songs with iTunes, a website, or some other means if you can).

Finally, open the files of the songs with your DAW and have fun!  Mashups are a great way to spend some spare time!!! 




 No problem!  Just wanted to help straighten things out for you if you had gotten confused.  Orcas are the largest oceanic dolphin species but, interestingly, they and the other blackfish (dolphins that are predominately black) have "whale" in their common name! 




 Are you saying since killer whales are toothed whales they're also dolphins?  If so, that's not true.  Sperm whales, beaked whales, and porpoises are all toothed whales and are not (oceanic) dolphins. 

If you're comparing killer whales to other toothed whales and saying that since killer whales are more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to other toothed whales, then you're correct.  




 Taxonomically, yes.  Whales are any species that belong to the order Cetacea and oceanic dolphins are any species that belong to the family Delphinidae (river dolphins encompass a few different families).  So from a taxonomic context, you'd be correct saying a killer whale is a whale, correct and more specific saying a killer whale is a dolphin, correct and most specific saying a killer whale is an oceanic dolphin, but wrong saying a killer whale is not a dolphin (or an oceanic dolphin). 

But this might not be the case in common nomenclature.  People tend to call small whales with a pronounced rostrum, "dolphins," which is a characterization that killer whales (and other "blackfish" - pilot whales, false killer whales, and pygmy killer whales) don't fit.  And there are also dolphins without pronounced beaks, such as the Risso's and Irrawaddy dolphins but they're smaller than .  River dolphins are not in the family Delphinidae, but are still called dolphins because of the large rostrums they have. Generally speaking, people call big cetaceans "whales," small cetaceans with conical teeth "dolphins," and small cetaceans with spade-shaped teeth "porpoises."  So from a common nomenclature context, you wouldn't be wrong calling a killer whale a whale since they're large relative to the other members of the family Delphinidae and the river dolphins and they don't have a pointy beak.

TL;DR: there's a difference between taxonomic and common nomenclature - in common nomenclature, many families are lumped together as "dolphins" and large oceanic dolphins are called "whales." 




 **E** 




 Sweatpants have been my go-to cold weather leg covering for years (to be fair though, I'm a college student).  They just feel better to me than jeans do!  I've also gone through some rapid weight fluctuations (down 30, down another 20, up 30, up another 30, down 30, etc.), so it's easier to have sweat pants with draw strings than cycle through a bunch of different sized jeans.  Also, they're making some nice looking sweats nowadays with pockets and normal pant legs (no more of the elastic-ringed bottoms)! 




 Sure thing!  And thanks for the advice!  I think I'm only going to get Massive now and if I decide I want more, I can always wait until the next sale. 




 Thanks!  I've heard positive things about massive and as long as it's as robust as I've heard, I may just stick with that (plus whatever comes with the DAW I decide to buy) for now.  This is definitely just a recreational activity for me so I think it might be best to go with the easier one for now. 




 Thanks!  I'm looking at producing as more of a hobby than anything so I want to keep my expenses down but still be able to make something that has a good quality.  From searching Reddit, it seems that synths go on sale rather frequently, so hopefully if you can't afford them now, you can afford them next time around!  




 That might be a good way to go!  I'm coming at this from a hobby point of view so I don't want to throw too much money into it, but I also want to have enough tools to set myself up to be successful in making something I enjoy.  




 Awesome, thanks!  I originally saw this link in r/FL_Studio and when I looked at the "Other Discussions" tab, there wasn't one for the post in this sub for some reason. 




 I've been interested in making music for a while and have played around with free DAW trials and free synths, but haven't actually bought any software yet.  Any suggestions on which of these to get?  I know Massive is good, but I don't know anything about the other synths.
