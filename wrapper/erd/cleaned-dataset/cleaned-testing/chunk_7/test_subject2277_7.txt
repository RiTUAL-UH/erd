 The context is the population.

There are 112,374,333 people who live in the state in question, Maharashtra.

58,243,056 are men.

In 6 months, 1300 farmers have killed themselves.

" So in just six months this year, the farmer suicide toll has already touched 66% of the 1,981 cases recorded in the entire year of 2014."

Last year, 1981 farmers killed themselves in that state.

Yep, it's a problem.

That enough context for you?

 Oh my God.  What will the RCMP do?

/s

Edit;

Everyone, it's OK.

It's back up.  Phew.  The country and the RCMP are back in business. 




 They're going to DDOS a website?  

You'd think they'd wait for the facts to come out. 




 What's with all the speculation?

We literally don't know what transpired. 




 You're actually defending a "female" with a biologically **male** body, fighting females with biologically female bodies?

Two elite class athletes in the same weight class, the male will be immensely stronger. 




 Good God, there are significant physical differences between men and women.

This is wrong and an embarrassment.

Wait until an adult decides they're really a 10 year old child and starts entering kids karate tournaments.

 Let's see the actual numbers.  Post your source. 




 A troublesome brain drain?  Care to provide a link.

I've not heard of this mass exit of the educated class and professionals 




 Empty?

No. 




 Longer hugs. 




 I don't think you know what an 'as is' sale is.
 




 So rare for married people to be happy.

Congratulations. 




 Negligent.

Losing track of a loaded magazine is negligent.

Negligence;

'
Is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.'

 




 The actual law allows gun owners to lose track of loaded magazines and then unknowingly transport those loaded magazines into schools?

Are you sure?

 




 The five independent witnesses who gave statements to the police, they're in on the cover up as well?

 




 Losing track of a loaded magazine and it falling out of your pockets in public is negligent.
