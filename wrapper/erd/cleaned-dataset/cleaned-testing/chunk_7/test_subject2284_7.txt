 Yeah, it's great! I'd rather rule over some eldritch monstrosities than Ash made from my own burning skin, thanks. 




 "What did Russia ever do in the world wars, eh?" 




 The whole point of that episode was to give people who'd been stolen from a second chance, too. 




 Come on THRESHER SHARK! Kick some ass! 




 I think it's due to, by either design or mistake, minecraft having the best FPS roleplaying system ever made, the way the avatars act and move in relation to players made it perfect for LPers like the yogscast to let it take off. 




 The majority of people in r/movies aren't exactly the people I would want to make an educated decision on sound editing in movies. This subreddit is basically for discussion of very mainstream movies and cult classics, it's not the kind of place to look for a discussion of the merits of the cinematography in Leviathan or Paprika or whatever. 




 I know it's never gonna happen, like, ever, but it would have been nice to see the Raid 2 get mentioned for sound effects or editing, as, in my opinion, the film was immensely technically impressive in those areas. Godzilla should have also got some sound effects noms. 




 The majority of people won't care about editing nominations. It's pretty much impossible to make a awards show with popularly excepted nominations EVERY time, but one could certainly argue that a show that's voted for by 90% 60+ white males won't ever come close. 




 Actually, I'd say critical dissonance is just as common as any other form of media, however, due to the wonders of the internet, people have an incredibly hostile approach to any kind of criticism/lack of perceived criticism. People are gonna hate destructoid for giving gone home 10/10 in the same way they hate destructoid for giving AC 2 a 4/10, or Empire magazine for giving Birdman a 5/5. Accepting other peoples opinions about trivial shit and moving on just isn't very valued in today's society.  




 Fun fact: the inventor of the lie detector was a polygamist, BDSM obsessed inventor of wonder women who likely had a fetish for people using lie detectors. 




 In *theory*. we already know that chronicles x carries over some of the races from xenoblade. 




 Actually, the OP is implied to be the intro to a show taking place in another timeline, with the song actually having a double meaning. You can also notice stuff like Madoka getting gradually more depressed due to the wacky antics, reinforcing the shows saccharine themes. 




 IF they sell it to the Her audience (who I'd say about 5% will have seen GITS, we're talking fairly casual film buffs here) they'll make it look more muted and quiet, mainly focusing on environment stuff in trailers. Under the skin is very debatable, many would argue that it's a character driven, and performance driven film, I've seen MANY people lavish praise on that performance. 




 Lucy was one of the biggest summer blockbusters of the year, and had a fairly decent critical reception, despite the fact that the film is pretty surreal. Johansson also starred in Captain America 2, another massive hit, and Her, which garnered a lot of acclaim. I also think under the skin had a lot of critical success due to her performance, particularly as it relied on her seducing people in real life. (some of those guys aren't actors) Spielberg also technically CAN'T take his name off, because he owns dreamworks, and he never took his name off transformers. My feeling is that the movie will be good to mediocre, but get decent acclaim from people who haven't seen the anime, and either aim for the 'her' audience or go all in with summer blockbuster mode, in which case it will likely sell gangbusters. 




 At least a GITS movie isn't being written by an actively hated figure like Frank Miller. the director made a decently popular movie (and had an affair with Kristen Stewart ) Lucy was a massive hit at the box office, and under the skin was a critically acclaimed indie, and Spielberg brings a ton of funds to advertising. 




 Well, Sin city 2 was also a mediocre movie from the writer of some islamaphobic comics and the director of spy kids 4, whereas GITS has a hot new director, one of the worlds biggest megastars and the approval of Spielberg.  




 Spike Lee's Oldboy was a movie NOBODY cared about though, at least people give a crap about GITS and Scarlett Johanssen.  




 That's actually why After Earth never mention shalalalalamalan in the trailers, he was just too damaging to market. 




 or get the coconut 




 Nito's just *dead.* Reanimated by some dark magic that keeps him in this state of death. 




 Basically, before you got there, there was about 100 different factions fighting each other, for wildly different Goals. But gradually, time eroded them away, condensing them down into the husks you see in the game, because they're simply nothing *left* to fight anymore. 




 Oh, he was already complaining on Ghazi about you? Fair enough. Seriously, I was mainly objecting to you attacking him for a Dtoid post on reddit, but I guess if he attacked you on ghazi already, it's fair to attack him here. Sorry to interrupt your little internet battle! 




 Wait, so do you have any actual evidence he's come from Ghazi? I mean, he's been on destructoid way, *way* before that post was made, And whilst I don't religiously follow c-blogs, I'm pretty sure he had a presence there, and it's not like that arguing technique originated on gamerghazi.

I just don't understand why You've decided to post it here. 




 Who the hell is 'Them?' why are you tying so hard to imply that TitusGroan is some form of malevolent entity, all he did was disagree with and criticize you. 




 The BSS is my favorite weapon. I was struggling with the game, got to the parish, and this baby dropped from the third Knight I fought. That sexy bastard. 




 Yeah, it's *impossible* that TitusGroan just missed that blog post. What difference does it make, anyway? You decided that a chan post was truthful, created a fiction around Anita Sarkeesian making controls easier, and it was picked up and seen as fact by a ton of people. It's pretty fair of Titus to call you out on that when you keep going on about feministfrequency, and it's pretty weird to act like he's some kind of Ghazi plant, and not even address him on the forum itself.  




 It's implied the plan A ship is going there anyway, but Anne Hathaway would have died in that time due to time distortion anyway. 




 I don't understand how TitusGroan 'followed' you to the community blogs, he's been on Dtoid for years. (so have I, incidentally)  




 Haven't played dark souls 2, but in the original dark souls AI's like solaire, Tarkus and Lautrec had way more health than you did, which is why Ganking is so prevalent. 




 Wait, how is it open ended? Anne Hathaway activates Plan B, dies of old age, the human civilization continues, thrives, becomes fifth dimensional beings, and creates the time loop which allows mccanaugheys  character to rescue the Earth humans, which then potentially rescue Hathaway. What's not to get? 




 Basically, the tomb of giants is a pretty difficult early level in the game, but an incredibly easy last level of the game, so do it as late as possible, bring some stuff that can light your way, and enjoy the cool atmosphere. 




 Try getting the sunlight maggot, It makes it so much easier to see in Blightown. 




 RELEASE THE WAR ELEPHANTS! THEIR BLADES WILL FALL UPON OUR GIANT SPONGES! 




 LOWER THE DWARVEN ATOM SMASHER! 




 Well, firstly, I believe their gameplay role is to be stealthed past, by moving from cover to cover, and they also demonstrate the fairly obvious message of 'brothels are bad, these women are forced to work in brothels, this guy kills people for sexual pleasure, your taget is a scumbag etc' as demonstrated by Log1c bombs rebuttal of  Thunderfoots video (although forgive me for going by on memory) that video also shows that the path isn't the ONLY path through that area.

I'd also argue that since it's a stealth game, the whole POINT is not to interact with people, as that requires being seen/discovered, and the player is discouraged from doing anything because it's an unnecessary risk. (you can also go through the whole game murdering EVERYONE with a variety of weapons, and ARE encouraged to kill a lot of people in creative/violent ways) I'd say that's enough ambiguity to say that that part not definitely ,objectively sexist. However, there are parts that do prove Anita's point better than she did, (her lack of detail on a lot of examples can prove annoying. Why is spelunky sexist, why is Watch_dogs portraying a sex auction negatively equivalent to endorsing it?) such as, for example, the hitman sniper challenge, where you literally are rewarded with a striptease through a sniper rifle scope, or the nun fight, where have to think of ways to light assassins dressed in bondage gear on fire to get the best score, which are parts of the game that encourage violence against women, rather than just feature the possibility of violence. 




 Y'see, I fought stray immediately after equipping the crest shield, and it never blocked ANYTHING for me. I ended up going full dex into him. 




 As you die, you actually DO die in that particular world forever, but due to time being convoluted, you're moved to a different one where you didn't. The curse of undead is a kind of cosmic balancing in favor of humanity, and the creator of the undead curse is a God far more powerful than the in-game God's, possibly Velka or a general judeo-christian concept of God. Therefore, the only thing that can possibly happen is the reign of 'Gods' ends in all possible universes/strands of time. 




 Every time you respawn you go to an alternate reality, and stuff either doesn't respawn due to that already being gone in the reality or due to some divine controller actively not respawning it to help you. 




 Eh i'd say that Absolution encourages you not to kill the women in That  particular example by having it go against gameplay mechanics (it's a stealth game) and giving those particular NPC's sympathetic dialogue. However, there are OTHER elements of the game that do encourage you to do that, such as the hitman sniper challenge thing in Log1c bombs video and the nun attack, which are less ambiguous example. I do think TB is wrong, and that the whole point gets blown out of proportion, but some better examples could've been made to prove that point. 




 It's worth pointing out that that there really isn't *consensus* on this matter, as multiple people who are branded 'anti gg' actually think bayonetta is a *positive portrayal* instead, and encourage debate on the subject. 




 I don't know, TB is still giving Jim sterling money via Patreon and retweeting his stuff, and thew only bridge that he's seemed to really have burned recently with his tirades is the yogscast. 




 a weapon to surpass metal gear? 




 eh, it's a shame that it's a goal that won't actually be met. But who knows, maybe if they get drunk enough it'll be lowered to 850 k or something? 




 Basically, the game can be hacked so that every swing of their sword teleports you to an area outside the map, where you cant die and fall forever, because DS saves all the time, you're stuck there. They can also do things like give you an egghead or curse you or whatever, and just generally screw up your game. The multiplayer component of DS basically necessitates people not modding or looking through the code.  




 To be honest, the PC version of dark souls is swarming with hackers who could already permanently break your saves, so the debug version isn't adding that much salt to the wound. 




 It's a 'hit 3 weakpoints' fight popularized by zelda. 




 Wasn't it just one guy one reddit though? Or was there more of an outcry on Tumblr? 




 I'm going to try to play inquisition as an asexual character due to this.  




 Nah, there bigger problem was that people they deluded into joining GG Didn't do that. The 'Ethics in game journalism' guys didn't hate DA, because it's a good game, and they couldn't effectively stave themselves off. 




 There was also a gay character in Phantasy star II. 




 Well, there was captain Rainbow, where you had to get Birdo out of Prison by proving they were a girl by finding there vibrator.... yeah.... 




 Actually, I don't think *representation* for women in games isn't really that bad, as a tonne of games just let you make your own character now, with RPG's in particular generally having pretty even representation. (not a full 50/50, but decent enough) You still have some old stalwarts, like the FPS genre, but even they are making concessions to the demographic by having token female characters and character creators for multiplayer. Whether women are represented *well* in games is another matter, and there's a large lack of charismatic leads in games in general, but it's not exactly difficult to find female characters in games. 




 Have you done the dragon age keep? I'm new to the franchise too, but due to the *fantastic* way the PSN servers are down, I can't play it, because I want to sync my keep saves. 




 Eh, depends how interpret killing imaginary people for your own enjoyment without pretensions of 'advancing a story'. They're pure escapism basically, and I think it's unwise to consider them to be universally considered 'gross' yet. 




 Well, the first Postal is essentially a more retro version of hatred, basically just killing people for the sake of it, in much the same way as old arcade games and stuff. It was called mediocre by critics and was passed upon. Postal 2(the popular one) was a much more satirical game, you start every level in a frustrating situation, like waiting in line, and can CHOOSE to start doing stupid, violent shit like using a cat as a silencer or whatever, basically, much like GTA or Just Cause but in a much more constructed level, like say, hitman. Postal 2 is essentially the game people like, and is much lighter/sillier than Hatred. 




 Right, I was with you up until that point, but a British person, liking *those?* My god. 




 You're in the *continent* of America, you Yankee, pancake eating scum! 




 If you're looking for walking simulators, a lot of recent horror games have similar gameplay mechanics to Gone Home, such as Alien: isolation, amnesia 2, outlast and particularly P.T. After that you've got the Stanley Parable, which is 'funnier' than Gone Home, but noticeably shorter (and wasn't complained about by GG for some reason) 




 Another neat thing about Lautrec is that his mage companion in the fight wears the crimson set, and there's precisely on sealer of New Londo unaccounted for... 




 I hope Rythian plays Sweden again. Does Malmo have a better memory than Datlof? 




 Yeah, but the way CQC/hostage taking is managed is way more efficient, and quick, and cool. 




 They cost the same amount of money, why shouldn't I? Why should you buy GZ over HD collection, even if GZ is just an intro? 




 Rythian only went for cultural last game. He usually goes Diplomatic/Science, which actually succeeded... once.... 




 But that doesn't apply to MGS. The Les Enfentes terribles project is the reason big boss left the patriots, which factionalized it between Para, sigint, and zero and snake and Ocelot, with Eva having shaky allegiances at the time of TPP (and presumably still a Chinese agent) if you don't know that, the drama won't have a much depth. 




 Well, the 4k are way better guarded than everything else, remember, to get there you have to get the seal/ get past the forest hunters and hydra, kill sif, get a cursed weapon, get ingward to lower the water, get past the wraiths, find artorias' ring, and THEN you can enter the Abyss, whereas everywhere else basically just lets you/an army stroll in. Only one guy could ever reclaim New Londo, and he has to do it alone. 




 It's difficult to say. New Londo is probably the place most fucked up by the time displacement. (possibly because of proximity to the abyss) Hence why artorias has history there despite dying in Oolacile, darkwraith attack you if your on their side, ingward doesn't care about the wraiths , the summonable ally may have died years ago etc. 




 It's....ok, it's mostly finishing up Peace Walker and setting up TPP. And in my opinion, it has way more emotional impact if you've played MGS3 and Peace Walker. MGS3 and Peace walker are also much better games for the money, even if GZ is still good. 




 Yep, apart from TPP almost certainly specifically addressing the Les enfant terribles project. 




 I'd say play MGS3 and Peace Walker before reading online, and then the other games are pretty fair to look up. MGS3 in particular really sets up TPP, and it's better to experience characters/twists first hand. 




 You sort of need to get a bit further into Peace walker for it to really 'click'. Once you start fultoning a lot of guys the game really starts to open up, and all the controls are designed to make you feel like this incredible badass. I'd also recommend playing through MGS3 again, either  with a guide or having read the TV tropes page. There's an incredible amount of neat stuff you've missed. Just the end alone has about 50 unique interactions, and you can do cool stuff like throwing rotten food around the fear, which'll make him eat and poison him. 




 What about Food fight? 




 Doesn't Q answer to his race though? He's also more fallible and less pragmatic than a lot of characters, and would probably lose to say, batman. 




 Well, it probably got brigaded by by people who saw all the coverage, and, to be honest, Hatred looks a lot more functional than 90% of greenlight games anyway. 




 Not really, this subreddit is against gamergate, not against Hatred. He doesn't need to justify himself. 




 They've also never released rapelay on steam. Could this be *denying Capitalism?* 




 I like how GTA gets blamed on the feminists because apparently it's only feminists who care about violence against Women. Why would a *conservative* ever want to ban a game? 




 Hey, remember how everyone abandoned Sega in 1990 for having a gay character in phantasy star II? Everyone knows Sega began to *struggle* in 1990. 




 Not just that, he was the *previous CEO of FROM* If that's not collusion, I don't know what is. 




 Well, He actually got it wrong, he clearly meant to say **Artorias** great sword. 




 Perhaps the mistake is crossbreed priscilla? After all, the common sentiment is that she's Seathes child. 




 I think part of GG is pent up aggression over the Gone Home getting 10/10's everywhere, and costing a fair amount of money on release, you could also point to things like the Sarkeesian videos and the Polaris game Jam as other things which built up some bad blood. A lot of people didn't like some of these things for issues other than social ones (If a guy says 'Gone home costs too much' or Sarkeesian should have stuck to her video deadlines' he gets lumped with GG) and therefore allowed themselves to be distanced from the people who WERE complaining about those social issues. (i.e the 'it's about ethics' stuff) 




 mmm? maybe we should tell them the secret? plans to kill? the men and ban them? from the games? 









 Avengers 2 will suck because I said everything else would suck, and,well, I'd look stupid if I said it might be OK. Can't break rule of three! 




 Heh, funnily enough he's freaking out over the trailer on twitter. 




 I don't think I've ever seen a game Sips is so naturally talented at, similarly, I've never seen him go so far out of his way to screw himself. 




 Blodborne is basically set in future Carim, Marvelous Chester is even implied to come from a Victorian version of Carim  




 Everything other than SMB isn't really a dedicated platformer, most are metroidvanias where platforming isn't that valued, and some are MOBAS or sandbox games. There are a bunch of PC platformers, but the majority of people find button pushing to be more enjoyable than key presses. 




 IMO third person action games, such as Devil may cry, benefit from a controller, as do 3D platformers, rythm games and some JRPG's 




 After nearly 10 minutes of dead silence from Lewis


Ben: so many composite bowmen


Lewis: Yes *lets see how they do*

Bloody terrifying.
 




 Arm fall off man? 




 You'd think after over a year of knowing about the bug they'd know how to fix it properly. 




 Well, by the end of the game you should really have a light spell or the sunlight helm from Solaire, or at least I did. I dunno, maybe I was just lucky. 




 Well, pinwheel is essentially meant to be ran to on suicide/machismo runs, and is a reward for beating that section early. I really steamrolled both TOTG and the catacombs as a level 90, and the pervading feeling I got is that it's really not designed for a character that's pretty powerful/knows all it's tricks 




 When people say 'one shot' they may also mean killing it without it getting to fight back, I can stab the skeledogs twice with a BSS before they can attack. 




 Basically, get the keyblade form the polearm merchant and use it to fight solaire, when he dies, it'll open up the next area. 




 Basically, the guy who makes all those Bro movies with terrible female characters. I'm excited for suicide squad (although I have no idea where Amanda Waller is) but Ayer is NOT some kind of savant. 




 Well, the Inhumans movie is being made so they can have mutants without having to step on the license. It'll probably be similar to the comic arc now with the terrigen mist attacks or whatever. 




 Well, it's a setting a pretty awful message to *ban female ejaculation*, even if it is in porn, and is essentially a short sighted attack on people who can't campaign against it because Britain is too prudish, and it's not like the Government has nothing better to do, a couple weeks ago it was discovered there was a *child rape and murder ring* of politicians. 




 Wow, the true story here is that Arnie Hammers gone from starring in Hollywood blockbusters to working in Hollywood Bowling alleys.  




 Well, The green parties work in Brighton has been an utter shit show, they're massively unpopular over here now. 




 Maybe, but to me the theme of the UA is that Velka is helping you, so it lines up better, but other opinions are available. 




 I mean Anastacia is the only one that still has a body after her death, the others disappear in a burst of light. Presumably, someone thought it was vital the firekeep shrine firekeeper was as hard to kill as possible, as it's the de-facto safest place in Lordran. 




 It makes sense from a lore perspective, Solaire, like other players, is in another world, so he's already killed his worlds centipede demon, and put his summon sign down for some jolly co-operation. What wouldn't make sense is seigmeyer having the ring, as he's in your world exclusively.
