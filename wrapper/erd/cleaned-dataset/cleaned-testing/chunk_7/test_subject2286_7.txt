 Carson running to the left of Christie and Paul, start the popcorn. 




 We banned the Klan from wearing mask in public back in the sixties and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld it about twenty five years ago. As far as I know it's never been taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, so apparently, you can't ban free speech, but you can ban anonymous free speech. If not, I guess we have to give the Klan back their hoods. Doesn't matter what the message is, you either do or don't have a right to anonymous free speech.  




  Selling products worldwide, made through offshore sources can bring record profits

If that is true, how would increasing their profits even more, bring back U.S. jobs? Wouldn't they just logically invest even more of their capital in outsourcing? Also, you still haven't addressed the false narrative in your headline that "U.S. companies are already at a competitive disadvantage", yet somehow are still making record profits. 




 So, you concede that profits are at record highs, in spite of having posted a headline that says that "U.S. companies are already at a competitive disadvantage"? How could both be true?

 Actually, it's almost exactly what Dutch Van Der Linde tells John Marston at the end of Red Dead Redemption. 




 I suspect that about a hundred people, all with a couple dozen accounts and no job or much of a life, sustain these subs and make then appear more popular than they really are.   




 Why the hell are we trying to fix crumbling bridges when we could be drug testing welfare recipients!  














 WASTED  




 P.S.

Got any more of that "Foreign Aid".  




 Many of these same shows would have been sponsored by corporations conspiring to convince the majority of the american people that smoking wasn't addictive and didn't lead to lung disease.    



















 So your local politics aren't a concern? 




 This message brought to you by the Know Nothing Party. 














 And she said this while wearing short hair, no make up and pants. 




 According to a Fox News poll, released [yesterday](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2015/01/29/fox-news-poll-voters-believe-romney-clinton-remain-top-picks-for-2016-believe/), Romney lead with 21% followed by Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee each at 11%, and Jeb Bush at 10%. How does Romney backing out the next day move Bush from fourth place to Frontrunner?

 But it wouldn't have been "England" back then would it? Would have been Britian. 




 They paved paradise, but life finds a way. 




 So, if a Muslim woman came to the White House, she should uncover her head and wear a skirt that shows her knees or she would be considered rude?  




 To collect unemployment benefits, you must have worked a minimum amount of time and/or received a minimum amount of earnings -- from your previous employer. So how is that free and who is it stolen from? 





























 Died the same year as John Marston. 




 That was on Bush's watch. 



















 How many farms actually get cable television? 




 Is that the same book that says you can't eat bacon? 




 Have you ever heard of the book "Why Johnny Can't Read"? It was published in 1955, 60 years ago. 









 And when Obama wore "Mom Jeans" nobody, oh wait... 




 Pretty sure she knows about this and pretty sure she knows what's in it and doesn't think it could hurt her chances.

 Seriously, who the fuck pays people to climb rocks?!? 




 If I could put $60-80 more bucks a month in the pockets of almost every single household in the U.S. I really wouldn't care what it did to oil producers in Texas, and North Dakota. Net Sum gain.  




 I would guess programing a Christian station would be difficult, not only would you have to take musical style into consideration, but the Dogma and Theology expressed in the lyrics as well.

 "Anti-police activist". So this guy is opposed to having laws enforced or opposed to having laws?  




 I guess that's why we've got all those Independent in congress. 




 I guess if you subscribe to the theory that Pop music isn't good music, you must accept that good music isn't very popular.

 But none of them were cops. 




 Just think of all the people who did complete University that you've never heard of. 




 Have they heard about helicopters?   




 This isn't actually a dumb move, for a guy running for VP. Huck is figuring that the GOP nominee will be someone like Bush that is so pro immigration and education, that Neo-Cons will call them a "Rino", or someone like Paul that isn't pro military or anti drug enough for them, that there will be a need to balance the ticket with an evangelical. 




 Me too. I was like "Just because they found a 19th century pear point in a freshly killed whale in the 90's, doesn't mean it was thrown by a 19th century guy." That's when I realized they meant the whales had been alive since the 19th century and I am a dumbass.   




 US releases 5 more men who were never charged with or convicted of anything.  




 Good. I like this. It makes me happy. People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.      




 Kinda doubt batmanEXPLOSION is an adult. 



















 This is my guess, after de Blasio "indicated his commitment to tackling the problem with a new approach" homeless people, from other places, moved to NY, figuring it would be easier to be homeless in NY. 




 I'm old enough to remember when whites in the South called MLK   the Freedom Riders "Trouble Makers". 




 Looks like Jimmy Carter.

 The people who want the government to run your life are anti-police? 




 I wonder, what does one have to google in order to stumbleupon such information? 














 Polls said that 79% disapproved of congress, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014. People are dumb.

 I guess the only question now is, what percentage of people voting in the Democratic primaries will be Progressives? 




 That was like two hours pay in 1921. 




 Now let's find out who the real old timers are, who remembers what we used it for after christmas was over?   




 That was "The Devil and Miss Jones", not "Behind The Green Door". 




 You sound like Mitch Mcconnell. 









 They masterbate over it. "At last, we get to shoot them!"

 Wait, so you're telling me that just because something is unpopular with most of those affected by it, doesn't mean that it will be a failure?   




 I think people are mislead by the name   font into thinking it's some old established newspaper that it isn't. It was founded in '82 by the Moonies. 




 Yeah, that was like a WND post. 














 Yes actually it does. Compared to other cars made in the 1950's, this car is neither oversized or gets shitty milage.  




 It's was the late 70's, but that's a late 50's car.

 This assumes that one can't be both Black and Republican and therefore must be either a fake Black or a fake Republican.

 I think he provides balance. Whereas Warren will run to the left of Clinton on some issues and Sanders will run to the left of her on most issues, Webb will actually run to her right on some.  














 Don't we fund our government by taxing income in this country? 




 The kind of "weapon" he is carrying is irrelevant, if he was a twelve year old white boy from Kentucky and was carrying a .22 rifle and cops did this, a whole different group of people would be outraged that his second amendment rights had been violated.

 5 out of 6 white murder victim are killed by whites. Statistically, if you are white, you should be more worried about being killed by white people.

 Ted Cruz suggests Al Gore's running mate to replace Hagel as Secretary of Defense. 














 I actually feel kind of bad for the conservatives now, as long as the emails were missing, they could fantasize about what was in them, now it'll be Benghazi all over again.  




 Pretty sure if Fox News had been around back in '65, they would have ran a headline something like this for LBJ.
