 That is a very silly comic.  

I might get down voted here, but I'm with you in that I'm not as crazy about the Iron man films either.  

Have you seen the new Robocop?   




 The "hey I loved the movie is (like I stated) nostalgic, and also very subjective - which is completely valid. Movies by their very nature speak to different people in different ways.  

But I would still reiterate that movies are not black and white.  We love movies because they are so multi-dimensional. 

I would go back to my article (and give me more traffic ;) ) by emphasizing that it is the soul of the film that matters most. 

With your reasoning (Murphy's death and Lewis gender/race), nothing short of the Paul Verhoeven film would suffice - and I'm not sure if I'm crossing any lines here, but I think that a highly faithful adaptation would just come off as imitation Verhoeven/Robocop.  Which would ring extremely false and very disingenuous.  That's why I wouldn't defend say... the Total Recall remake or the Red Dawn remake.  

This film tries something new.  The vital parts of the film that you refer to is that he dies - how he dies is interpreted by the directors in different ways.  The vital thing about the partner is that there is a tether to his earlier humanity - not race or gender.  Those are just superficial.

The film also seems to have a Fellini-esque quality, where the marketing team is imagining how to "design the product" for a larger audience.  Maybe Padhila is commenting on the bullshit marketing that they think WE like.  I would even caution to guess that maybe their would be a certain segment of the audience that wants a Robocopo more like the original EM-208.  ;)

All I'm saying is, if you give the film a chance, you might notice that it's actually trying to be about something.   




 Completely inventive use of squibs.
