 You clearly haven't thought about J.J. Watt playing next to Aldon Smith.

QBs would *die*. 




 Yeah ... that'd be a nice replacement for Justin Smith. 




 That really set the mood of the whole game.  The Niners were there to *hit* people. 




 That site isn't exactly a bastion of quality journalism. 




  the Nissan Cube's weird back window thing.

There's a lot more wrong with the Cube's appearance than just its back window. 









 It looked like a suicide bombing - who were the Chilean's going to go after?  The killer was dead. 




  I don't know if you're implying that the French supplied a lot of troops or if they had a part in the leadership of the Army.

They did.  There were almost as many French troops at Yorktown as American, and the fleet that won the Battle of Chesapeake Bay was entirely French. 




 There's no camping at the trailhead itself, but there's a nice campground called "Domingo Springs" a quarter mile beforehand.  Best water you'll ever taste, there. 




 Seems doubtful.  Sim's entire male family would have to die first - he's got three older brothers.

"Poet Killer" refers to the sword, and I think someone used it to kill Sim, whom Kvothe then avenged and took the sword (which is possibly Cinder's). 




  I'm surprised by the amount of electricity across the parts of the South which can get well below freezing many times during the winter.

There's a difference between "occasionally goes below freezing during one season" and "gets below free 50% of days of the year."  It's in the latter case the electricity becomes much less economical.
 




 While flipping through a book at work a few years back, I found a "Merry Christmas" letter from Paul Newman to my boss (who worked in the film industry a long time), dated 1975.  So that was interesting. 




 He's lying - they're deep-sea fishing poles, to help feed the crew. 




  'There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.'

I love the fact that Rothfuss quotes are now being tossed about as deep wisdom. 




 El'the is the highest rank. 




  Even being born and raised here I don't like Nevada as a whole.

Funny how often I hear that.  I know a bunch of people from Reno, and I don't think any of them actually like it there. 




  Does vaccinating make everyone safer? Yes. Does that make it okay to force people to do it? No.

Make an argument against mandatory vaccination that can't be made in favor of allowing drunk driving. 




 I thought I'd offer it here first, instead of trying eBay, where the interest might be limited.  It's in *decent* shape, though it has a torn overleaf with an old dedication, and minor water damage around the corners of some of the back pages.  It's the 1890 printing, and has a lot of really great illustrations.

It's been collecting dust on my shelf for twenty-five years, and I figure someone here might be interested in it for historical or decorative purposes.  **PM me** if so.

Here's some pictures:

  So you'd have to stay in Chester or near Lake Almanor to stay in the prettier parts of the area.

The hills south of Almanor are pretty ravaged from the Chips Fire, and then Sierra Pacific going in and clear-cutting. 




 
Ah, yes, "Just Turn Overs," along with such illustrious company as Ken Dorsey and Cody Pickett.
 




 Depends on how much effort you want to go to.

- A handful of pebbles from Glass Beach
- Avocados and almonds
- Wine from Napa or Sonoma, and some Sierra Nevada beer
- Emu or ostrich jerky 
- A postcard from San Diego, since I'm guessing proper Mexican food wouldn't survive the trip.  Maybe some good flour tortillas.
- A sliver of redwood or sequoia bark, picked up off the ground.
- A ticket stub from a San Francisco street car.
- A few grains of California gold, in a small clear glass vial filled with Feather River water (hell, I can provide that one).
- Some Ghirardelli chocolate.
- Absolutely nothing whatsofuckingever to do with Fresno, Bakersfield, or Vacaville. 




 There are, to be honest, far more beautiful lines in the KKC.  I just can't bring them to mind.  But Rothfuss sure knows how to sing a passage. 




 It seems a lot more likely that Roderic is the King to be killed, and that the Jakis family was trying to poison the Maer.  Remember, Caudacus mentions visiting the Jakis family estates not too long ago.

I think Bredon is a human agent for the Chandrian, myself.  I also think Dagon is a disguised Chandrian - perhaps even Cinder. 




  I do want to give it to someone in like dire need and all.

Then don't worry about me - I've just been scrounging around online trying to get some money in my PayPal account. 




 I could use about that much in my PayPal account ... it's not for anything remotely important, I've just got my eye on something and the seller only takes PayPal, and my linked checking account is overdrawn for at least two more days. 




  At least that's what Palosczi-Horvath writes in his Krushchev biography, it's an old book and maybe there's better scholarship nowadays.

You'll want to read William Taubman's *Khrushchev* (2003), then.  The secret speech was the results of months of research instigated by Khrushchev, and largely written by him with help from a few others.  Written and re-written, and passed around the Presidium before it was delivered (by a day or two). Malenkov didn't seem to figure into it, and was already well on his way down, with the attempted coup sort of his last gasp. 




 Way to stay on top of breaking events there, OP. 




 Lassen National Park, I suspect.  Lots of active vents, decent hiking, and a great resort to stay in (Drakesbad).

Though it's too late to book a room now. 




 When gathered around the fire before the "assault" on Ambrose's rooms, Kvothe notices that Devi is wearing Denna's jewelry, and when he asks where she got it, she says "A pretty young man used it to settle his debt to me." 




  Pretty sure he was just in way over his head.

He came across as too perfectly naive, and did so in a way that kept upping the ante.  Like his earlier acts didn't work, so he had to lay it on a bit thicker before Denna helped him.

Much like Kvothe, I don't think Denna is as world-wise and clever as she thinks she is. 




 "Sacrifice Fresno" is always the right answer. 




 Gun owners in California are *also* not like Jews in Nazi Germany.

And you have yet to show any rationality or truth, beyond repeating that phrase over and over like some talisman that you don't actually understand. 




 "Stairway to Heaven."

It's not even a very good song. 




  Yes, that would be an entitlement is everyone was given firearms for free.

... uh, that directly contradicts your own previous statement that an entitlement is "guaranteed access."

A right would be the freedom from being forced into not being able to own them. Like the Nazis did to the Jews under the Third Reich ect

Well, that was fast.  Because gun owners in America are like Jews in Nazi Germany. 




 Well, you've certainly proven your point with great eloquence and evidence. 




  Guaranteed access to something is called an entitlement, not a right.

So guaranteed access to purchasing firearms is an entitlement, not a right?  You know, by your logic. 




 Found the single-issue voter. 




 Because Putin has really scored success after success in the whole "international relations" scene. 




 That would involve a massive jump in personnel - the RN has about 32,000 active members.  A *Nimitz*, including airwing, has a crew of over 5,500.  Even the newer *Ford*s, with increased efficiency of operations and automation, has a complement over 4,000. 




   If you find a tipo

... was that on purpose? 




 I don't have the option of heating food up for lunch at work, so I love making cold pastas - which rules out anything tomato-sauce based.

Either I make:  

Quickly boiled rotini (cold pasta is best with a bit of bite); mixed with shredded deli-sliced ham, pepperoncinis, kalamata olives, red onion, feta cheese, salt, pepper, and a bit of mayo for a sauce.

or 

Udon noodles, finely chopped green onions, chicken or fried tofu, shredded cabbage, slivered almonds, and a dressing of sesame   peanut oil, soy sauce, crushed or powdered ginger, powdered garlic, lemon juice, rice vinegar, and fine-ground white pepper. 




  De Wault and Bosche are good for drills, but the latter is an expensive brand. 

If you're looking to save a bit of money, Milwaukee has been making good drills - and other power tools - for a while now.  And for very casual use around the house, Ryobi is fine.

Black   Deckers just fall right the fuck apart, though. 




 ... well, guess I know what I'll be doing tonight. 




 I've repeatedly tried Chrono Trigger, and can't get more than five minutes or so in.  After FFIII, Chrono Trigger just feels so ... childish.  The sound and music are a bit harsher and less pleasant, too. 




 In a true post collapse where we needed to be truly self sufficient wouldn't having things like seed or building materials/skills, knowledge of farming, water reclamation, electrical skills etc be a more relevant bartering items?

Sure, for the first few years.  But after some point, you're going to want a universally transferable currency, and history has shown that people prefer precious metals for that.  It's mostly an illusion, but if everyone plays along, it becomes real. 




  I'm Ryan, a Scotsman living in southern England.

That is so cliched.  And could not he have avoided unnecessary apostrophes? 




  the best of all has probably been Tim Couch, 

Derek Andersen was *OK*.  For a season.  He was hilariously bad in Arizona, of course. 




 I don't know about conning Kvothe, but I definitely think she got scammed by Geoffrey, when she paid off his debt to Devi by giving him jewelry.  He may even have split the difference with Devi. 




 There are a bunch of towns mentioned as being near Newarre (Rannish   Baedn, for example), and a few mentioned as being near the bandit camp (Crosson, etc.), but no overlap.  The map found in the bandit camp also seems to imply a great deal of distance from any town, unlike the short walk Bast takes to get to the lightning tree.

There's a greystone near the lightning tree, which Kvothe would be sure to notice at some point when dealing with the bandits.  And, most importantly, the lightning tree is on a hill, the bandit camp was in a small valley (a "bowl" as Kvothe describes it).

There's just nothing to connect to the two. 




 Of course it does. 




 Target will probably just cut her a five-figure check to go away, and if she's smart she'll take it. 




 "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream."

Look it up, find a free copy online, and weep. 




 It's California - I'm always worried about fire danger, and not because of dry lawns.  Hell, a dry lawn will flame up and burn out in like five minutes, without spreading.  It's all the dry brushland and forest that's the problem. 




 "Die Hard."  I'd just want to see how that worked out. 




 I'd have to do something useful for at least an hour. 




 Drank a beer.  By the time I finished, reddit was back, and I was in the proper mindset to enjoy it. 




  Generally you cut wood 2 years prior to burning anyway.

If it's green, yes.  If it's standing dead, you can burn it right away.  This works great for lodgepole, which matures and dies off rather fast. 




  I love anything pretty much by Lois McMaster Bujold.

Bujold writes the best dialogue in sci-fi, and damned near the best dialogue in any genre.  Miles negotiating with the hostage takers in *Komarr* ... just brilliant. 




 Meh ... Jack McDevitt is great at writing 3/4s of a book.  He really has trouble with his endings - like he had a great, epic idea, but doesn't know exactly what to *do* with it. 




 It also doesn't have any missiles attached, so it's not Russian enough. 




 Sacramento is halfway to everything, which puts you in a great spot.  I can't recommend anything on the coast, since I'm not familiar with it, but don't forget that it's not just the ocean that has good beaches - there are plenty of large lakes within a 2-4 hour drive. 




 Overlapping fields of fire, combined with sloped walls that helped deflect artillery fire. 




 There's no such thing as blowing money on booze. 




 I didn't.  It's a perfectly useful online social tool, and most of the aggravation that people have with it is self-created. 




 A family - two parents and two young children, came in, sat down, and were perfectly quiet during the entire movie.  As was the rest of the audience. 




  They would have preferred OBL to remain alive to make Obama look bad.

It's not so much that, as that it didn't happen while Bush was President.  Because, you see, Jesus Cowboy Bush was just *supposed* to bring in bin Laden, "Wanted Dead or Alive Poster" style.  And when that pre-conceived narrative didn't happen, they just couldn't handle the reality of what *did* happen. 




  that these guys were able to master it.

Except the Germans never even came close to mastering it.  The GZ was poorly designed, and likely would've been target practice it it'd ever tried to sortie out. 




  Bush came on TV and straight up said "Osama bin Laden. Afghanistan." Then a couple months later, it was just "Hussein. Iraq."

You sort of had to live through it - the right-wing media hate machine was in full force against anyone who questioned invading Iraq.  And a lot of Yellow Dogs (Democrats who voted for the war) spinelessly went along with it, making it that much easier to utterly demonize anyone who said so much "Hey, this just might possibly be a bad idea." 




  it doesn't tell me how to find a fire-extinguisher-checking-professional 

That'd be the nearest Fire Department.
 




 I can't believe *The Walking Dead* has been lying to me.


... but seriously, this is a huge problem with post-apocalyptic fiction. 




 They're just hoping you'll be the one to get pulled over when you get near Colusa. 




 It poured like hell for about twenty minutes ... and then stopped. 




 Ambrose can't become king unless the Maer is dead first, which you seem to rule out.  Lerand Alveron is in line to the throne immediately after anyone in the Calanthis family.

Although I do agree that Ambrose and his father are trying to murder their way to the throne.  Arranged shipwrecks and duels being the case so far, as well as trying to poison the Maer (and the Chancellor, making Hemme the new Chancellor). 




 Fine - tell me by what metric *you* would define "Worst division in the NFL."  Because I'm guessing "Anything that doesn't have the NFC South as the result" is your answer. 




 How about a really horrific point differential?  I mean, -227 for the division is atrocious.  Only the AFC South is close to that bad, and both South divisions have about twice the negative point differential as the next worst division. 




 There had actually been a series of minor and medium sized eruptions over the course of the previous year or so.  This picture led to a huge-assed mushroom cloud that could be seen throughout northern California - just GIS for "Lassen Eruption 1915". 









 It's colloquial, kind of like saying "Canadian Goose/Geese."

Its like calling a jackdaw a crow.

 Where they're usually just called a Bluejay.  And they're persistently annoying as hell, especially in the morning. 




 My parents always kept soy sauce in the lazy-susan corner style shelf in the kitchen, for years at a time.  Never went bad. 




 Was that the split-screen one?  Because it looked really cool, but I never got around to playing it. 




 That is correct, they didn't. 




 Gone? 




  How is the NRA extreme?

Have you actually listened to them?  We're talking about the people who literally think the UN is going to come rolling in any day to seize everyone's guns.  Just look at the foaming-at-the-mouth NRA whackjoberry over the UN Small Arms Treaty a few years back. 




  As an inner city healthcare worker, how many injuries do you see from assault weapons and high capacity magazines?

That's a good question, unfortunately the Republican controlled Congress of the late-90s banned any research into this.  It's almost like they didn't want to know the answer. 




 If this represents a $1.00/hr. raise, and if every employee was working a full 40-hours a week, 52 weeks a year (which, at a pizza place, I really doubt), this would be a $25,000/yr. increase.  That's ... about the price of one full time, min. wage employee.  

Yeah, I'm thinking this place was going under anyways, if it's operating on such a narrow margin. 




 Taking baths with my sister. 




 With actual puppet strings, that are edited out in real-time.  The crowd gets bribed, because that'd probably cost a lot less than the absurd profits made from this fight. 




 Nothing.  It's just ... man, don't worry about it.  It all just sucks.  Have a drink then have another one.  Then another one.  Shit's just fucked up. 




 So, nothing of value. 




 Best:  I don't recall that ever happening.

Worst: Coming home the other day and finding the power turned off.  Woohoo! Yay for being broke! 




 Give it to me, I actually need it. 




 Despair and alcohol.  




  I found that the Ringworld series did much the same thing. 

Niven is a classic case of an author being overtaken by the Brain Eater. 




  Yolks have the funkiest of tastes

I've never read something so fundamentally wrong in my life.  You've never enjoyed using toast to sop up the yolk from a fried egg?

An excerpt:

A *very* interesting bit of information:

This may be old news to some (date March 16th), but I didn't see anything about it here. 




 Unless you live in a small town, in which case it's strange *not* to see them.  I mean, there were only like thirty total teachers from Kindergarten up through High School.  And a lot of them had kids that were friends of mine, so I'd go over to their houses on a regular basis. 




 Well, I don't know about him, but I'm making aluminum ingots as a trade good after the collapse of civilization.


^Either ^that ^or ^I've ^fallen ^asleep ^on ^the ^couch ^a ^few ^times ^while ^cooking ^on ^high ^heat. 




 Even OKC is now more than twenty years ago. 




 Kvothe isn't, but his sword is, implying that he used it to kill a poet. 




 Newarre is in Vint; that's been pretty well established. 




  Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati over Earl Thomas and Dez Bryant (hell Dez or Demaryius)

Six of one, half-dozen of another.  Davis and Iupati really paid off. 




  He may well be Vashet's poet-king.

Vashet specifically says that her poet-king was from the Small Kingdoms.  I think Kvothe kills both Ambrose *and* Roderic - the first gains his reputation as a "poet killer," the second his reputation as a "King-killer."  

The fact that Ambrose is a shitty poet doesn't matter.  Plenty of ass-kissers will likely play up his talent, making him into some kind of gifted poet. 




  I lived in San Francisco for a decade. 

San Francisco is like California concentrate.  It doesn't entirely reflect on the rest of the state, except maybe Berkeley and Davis. 




 Oh, God, the cancer warning stickers.  They're on fucking *everything*, regardless of how little sense it makes.  Like, aluminum chairs. 




 Do you claim that Russian forces in Ukraine teleported to get there? 




  I still haven't made it out to Drakesbad and that whole region of the park. Going to explore that and the Juniper lake region (which I haven't been to either)

I usually don't encourage tourism but ... the east end of the park is better.  I feel kind of dirty for suggesting it, but seriously - head on up into Drakesbad and Juniper.
 




 You're insane.  Just flat-out chicken-fucking insane. 




 Because clearly, the Russian military could be involved *inside Ukraine* without having to cross the border.  Somehow. 




  As I said before there is obviously Russian military in Ukraine

Which was my point all along.

but not the 100 long vehicle convoys. 

I never said anything about 100 vehicle long convoys - you're the one that keeps bringing that up.  You're really obsessive about fighting a strawman.
 




 OK.  Photographic evidence, video evidence, separatists admitting to journalists that the Russian military was helping, vehicles flying Russian flags ... I guess that's all meaningless.  Because you just *don't think it's true*, little Russia-bot, that's what's important.   




  Please show me a picture of the Russian military crossing the border. Not the Russian military in Ukraine.

You can't have the second without the first, unless you believe in teleportation.  Then again, you probably believe in all sorts of completely insane shit.
