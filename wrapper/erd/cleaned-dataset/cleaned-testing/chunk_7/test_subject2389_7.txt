 QI. I'm an elf and Stephen Fry is my Dad now. Best day ever. 
 




 No. The priest is the real father.  




 Mine's green. Can I stay? Perhaps as a sub-citizen? 




 I like food, booze and memes. 




 Brisbane, Australia.  




 Quentin Tarantino, Stephen Fry, Jack White. 
 




 Glad I clicked. 
 




 My folks managed a student accommodation complex. The washing machines were $1.50 per use. $1 and 20c pieces are close enough in size that they worked. 

One day Dad goes to take the change out of the receptacle and finds 70c only and some clothes in the machine.

He took the clothes and when the girl came up to say someone stole her clothes he gave them back and said "Is there anything you want to tell us?". 

Cue embarrassment, apologies, laughter and a promise she'd never do it again.   




 This guy is Australian. Medicare is our public health insurance provider. In our country that's actually about how much a therapist would cost, provided you don't have an addiction, at which point the government pays for all of it.


This is the facebook status of a friend of mine a week after he admitted to being an alcoholic:

"So now I have a GP, a social worker, a psychologist, an employment consultant, and a drug counselor all at no cost. Australia's not that shit sometimes."

 This is my favorite reddit post ever.  




 Mixologist. Some bartenders are putting this wank on their resumes. 
Just say cocktail competent.  




 TIL: frogs live 10-12 years in the wild. Can you imagine a frog's 10th birthday. Heh. Stupid frog. You don't have parties. Gribbit.  




 Don't try to make friends at uni. I'm about to finish my 4 years and I'm not taking a single friend with me. If it happens, cool, but don't plan on having 'buddies from college' when you are 50. 


If you're confused about what to do, take 6 months off. Work, travel if you have the means. Working full time, even as a bartender or waitress will make you enough money to be able to save so maybe you can alleviate some of the financial pressure.  

But that's all based on my experience. Different strokes for different folks.
