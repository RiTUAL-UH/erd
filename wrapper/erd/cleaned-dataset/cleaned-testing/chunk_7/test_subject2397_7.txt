 The uncyclopedia? What is this some sort of bing knockoff? 




 This goes for guys and girls *especially* on a first date: Do not be on your phone! 




 I love this episode, Barney's part is hilarious. "More marinara sauce!"

Really though, was Lily actually about to hop on a plane to Spain? Without Marshal and no money or plan for being there? This just gets glossed over but I bet if Marshal had found out about that it would've been a whole different story 




 Are you saying that first part is a good or bad thing? Because I think S6 was overall a little too serious 




 Good lord, this is the type of website we were encouraged to make in my 6th grade web design class. So awesome and horrible 




 The round mouse that they used? I hated those things

This week's project 




 You have nicotinic receptors that neurotransmitters can act upon including nicotine. So nicotine directly acts upon your nervous system which is why you get so dependent on it. Of course this is my limited knowledge from phys class so an actual doctor should take it away from here 




 She wanted the genes 




 But then how will I install Chrome? 




 I am I will?

 First saw her in the hallway of my gen Bio class and thought she was cute. A month later she was at my apt because she ended up bein a friend of a friend. Skip ahead like 5 months and I invited her to  a party I was having out of the blue and she came. We dated for 8 months after that 




 On home for spring break atm and m'mom made shrimp stir fry. So tasty 




 Skateboarding has the coolest physics 




 Pretty much. At McDonalds I got a burn from the fish steamer that was on my wrist for years later. Plus all the hot oil jumping off the grill constantly. Usually not a big deal though

 Whatever that Greek place is in South Seattle, they make the best fries I've ever tasted 




 I'm from seattle area! If you like weird stuff check out Ye Olde curiosity shop in Seattle, it's right along the water. You're also within walking distance of pretty much the whole city, at least as far as touristy stuff goes. If you want to go hiking, the Cascade mountain range is about 40 minutes from Seattle so not too far 




 Like the other person said it depends on how much you'll be making. That is not too much debt though tbh 




 Watch this sub be trending tomorrow 




 You'd be surprised. At night when all those places close down there are crazy people everywhere, and it's usually when all the tourist/business people are trying to leave 




 The times I've been up to Seattle I swear it turns into a whole different place the minute it turns dark out. There's some crazy people there, and like you said this is right by the main bus stop 




 He's trying to forget the constant hunger 




 NPH once again kills it with the acting at the end. He conveys that feeling of regret so well I can feel it everytime 




 Hopefully with proper spelling 




 Reminds me of the Portlandia sketch. You should have set him free 




 It's like the combover but the combfoward 




 that's usually how things get worse 




 It's a desert with nothing there besides Spokane 




 Someone want to explain this to a noob like me? 




 Thanks for your time. I'll be goin to the doctor soon 




 I don't think she was perfect I just think she was one of the few characters on the show that was a legitimately good person.  And she was finally a girl that Barney wanted to respect and someone he could live up to. Barney should have been allowed to get a girl like that 




 Yesterday my friend pointed out they look a bit yellow, and looking in the mirror they are definitely not quite white. I know that's a sign of jaundice but it just seems very unlikely. I'm a 22 college student, and yes I drink but I'd say an average amount. Any help? 




 *glass shattering* 




 I just think it should be removed all together. I don't llike any laugh tracks though 




 It still adds to cost though, and that's just one small example 




 How about we just stop spending money on things we really don't need at the moment. Looking at you oldbookieturnedstudentcenter 




 Slow down there you're flooding pics with too many quality pics

And here it is at Fairchild AFB. I'll upload more piCs if anyones interested 




 Dr Thunder 




 How about Tab cola? 




 I mean Barney Hooked up with Katy Perry and Brittany Spears so I don't know about that. I agree though Ted and Zoe is my least favorite. Just makes zero sense 




 That's what I'm sayin. Dark at 4:30 is seriously depressing. And who cares if it is dark in the morning 




 Often times you don't get very high your first time because the receptors in your brain aren't as activated as they could be. And you are more prepared the second time 




 Fair enough. I'd personally recommend trying it more than once but no big deal 




 Well good on you for being a responsible parent 









 Corpuscle 




 Now there's a jump in comedy 




 Absolutely. I feel like you are focused on one aspect here. This is a massive show and they did a great job constantly tying ideas/jokes in with each other. Some of their subtle references to other parts of the show are genius. And yeah they had their inconsistencies but nothing that ruined the show 




 Crocodile Dundee 3 totally holds up 




 Are we still talking about people? 




 The problem is it's really hard to keep a consistent pace for more than a bit sometimes. Things get tired and you have to move around a bit if you want to keep going 




 Ok that is pretty similar. Then again, there are tons of songs that sound similar to other songs 




 Looks like he made it. Clever bastard 




 Super Mario 3D land is super fun on nintendo wii u and very playable at any skill level 




 I've been to the midwest a few times and never saw anyone guzzling down mayonnaise and gummy bears 




 If this is real post it in response to the top comment  




 That makes no sense though. he attempted to move that stuff around to a better spot and they threatened to fire him? He probably got fired for taking his phone out at work 




 I think at this point its just like saying Kleenex or jello. I dont think people are idiots for saying the word gopro theyre not trying to advertise for them 




 It's not. And instead of the last 10 of these pics being posted in the OG thread karma whores have to make their own post so everyone can suffer 




 Star Wars Battlefront, the game I've played hundreds of hours. I remember in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days for the 2nd one to come out. Of course, it's all about Bespin Platforms and the sand dunes level. Then space battles on the second one 




 wastedgifs and michaelbaygifs 




 Well it was definitely in America too so I guess everywhere 




 Came in here to say that definitely is Century Link not Scotland  




 Twitch plays pokemon is what got me here. My username is after Lord Helix 




 6' and 150 lbs. Tryin to build more muscle mass though 




 Of course. Western films, cowboys, jazz, clothing, culture within the states, grunge/punk, cars. It goes on 




 I live in a college town, 2 summers ago there was an entire block of houses on greek row that opened up their lawns to one big party. There was easily over 500 people there, the street was totally filled with people, the houses were crowded and beer pong in the lawns. I could hear it all the way from downtown which is like a mile away 




 I kinda think this is really dumb. For one he's 20 years older, he's wearing a hat and sunglasses, and they wouldn't be expecting him to just be there 




 This is more of a myspace mirror shot 




 Not as cool as /r/28thworldproblems 




 Drunk me says it's... good! That right pinky toe though is like an entity of its own tho 




 Maybe this is the lookout cat while the other cats TP the yard? So many unanswered questions 




 This non non-alcoholic beer has alcohol in it 




 Knox claymation videos on Youtube. Not a site but seriously those were freakin hilarious 




 I remember for one glorious day I was the best in the world at that game. Oh how I lived 




 So we're just a couple a white people? 




 I'm fine with the location, dorms can walk there easily etc. I don't like the proposed uses though, either. It should be turned into something we don't already have, we have more than enough gym space. I seriously doubt this would alleviate much from the rec, they would just both be incredibly crowded 




 As your lawyer I have to advise you stop all further comments 




 Without being quantitative here I seriously think they drink every day to some degree or another, sometimes starting at about 8am. It's hard to tell what days they actually are in the bar since there's no definitive time line in the episodes. Some episodes span over weeks while others are days. Or in the case of season 9, about 10 minutes lol 




 I'm just waiting for the day someone either comes into my house at night or there's like a classroom hostage situation. Haven't decided on if I want to be the big guy on the news or humbly walk away from the situation yet though 




 The trick is to just stay on the edge 




 OP had the Breaking Bad filter on 




 KenM is a genius 




 [Sup bro](http://imgur.com/jJpJok1) 




 Considering everyone is getting the same degree/striving to the same goal I don't see how that matters at all. But based on your grades I think you can kindof guess how you are doing compared to others 




 I love this episode. Jorge Garcia playing the Blitz was hilarious like when he yells out the numbers from Lost. I also like this episode because they travel around alot. Seeing them in the bar and Ted's apartment gets kindof old after awhile but them driving around was pretty funny.  And seeing Barney's cardboard oven "I should probably disconnect the gas then" 




 -19 karma and gilded 3 times? That's gotta be some sort of record 




 What was worse is we had already heard all his songs 100 times. THEN they hit the radio, made it like 1000 times 




 dat double filet o fish is where it's at 




 Probably because they are far more expensive than other sports cars. Last time I checked a Mustang is like 20k less. And many people in their 20s seem to drive WRXs and used BMW's 




 I know some people who were offered lower management positions because they had degrees, one of which wasn't even in business or anything. I don't think getting a full time job will be too difficult for you because they need those people here, not just students who can work weekends 




 And the first time Lily is in his apartment he notices her by looking at the wall? Seems like it's implied that there is a mirror there or something reflective 




 Mentally. Getting an A in anatomy. It's the only A in a science class in college I've gotten and it took serious time 




 I think not at all. For one, even with all the knowledge at my fingertips I hardly look it up. In fact I'm sitting in a library right now with enough books to easily become a heart and brain surgeon but I'm not reading them because I'm not motivated to on my own. School has structure, and teaches you how to learn things, and you can interact with others. And if you've ever taken an online class you know they're just not as enjoyable as the classroom setting 




 I used to think this was the most boring show of all time. So wrong, I can't describe it the show is just amazing 




 I wonder if that's on his resume 




 I have terrible posture when I walk but when I actually remember to walk up straight I feel manlier 




 Seriously. Does the word porn mean something else? Maybe, but in this day in age especially on the internet it ultimately means one thing, and that's porn 




 Was just watching this episode and it's pretty extreme how Ted pulls this off, really to the point where Robin wants to date him less than she already did.  Not just renting the blue instrumented band but it also looks like there's about $100 worth of roses in the room. I guess looking back it just seems like Ted really was desperate for her 




 I believe its S2E4 Ted mosby-Architect.  Robin says one watch through was more than enough for that movie 




 Not nearly as awful as "Well, it the bug room, Ted.
Your ass just got bugged." 




 Or when Robin did the flip on Stella's daughter's bike trying to get back to the news station 




 Or when they sit on the table, and ask why when you tell them to get off. How bout 0 respect and that table costs more than your life 




 If I win I will flood /r/randomactsofpizza with pizza 









 I loved Robin all the up til about season 8. It started with her yelling at Patrice which I just found really annoying. Then in Season 9 when she was fighting with her mother in law the day before the wedding was not funny it was just painful.  Finally she just continued to be independent to the point where she only cared for herself
