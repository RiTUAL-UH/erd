 I'm not worried about food or water. There's matches, lighters. That's not what I'm worried about...I did find something with a date. I found a lot of things. I'll post more in the next update. I just need some time. Please don't leave me. Please stay. 




 I don't want to know what it looks like. Hearing it was enough. I felt it. It was all around me. It was right behind me but it's nowhere. I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE! 




 I'm okay. I think I'm alone right now. I hate being alone but...maybe it's better? I really really hope you're all friendly. Nothing feels friendly here. Nothing feels right anymore. Please stay! 




 I don't know, this computer is strange. Some programs are missing, others are...I'll see what I can do. 




 Oh god. I....I can't. I need more time. Something's watching. You might be able to see it too, I don't know. I'll post more later. I need more time. Please stay here.
