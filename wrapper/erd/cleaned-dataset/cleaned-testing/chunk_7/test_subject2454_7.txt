 Cub fucked my parlay. 




 CALM DOWN RABID PATS FAN!!! 














 I swear to god, I wanna see Vin Diesel in space, or underwater. 




 Machida successfully defended plenty of Weidman's takedowns.  But once he got him down, he kept Lyoto on the ground. 




 [for people not getting the reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTzHd1h47o) 




 Weidman is a big middleweight.  So big in fact, that Rockhold might not have a size advantage. 




 Enough people have done it though. All you have to do, is be bigger and stronger than him. 




 You can be an innovator, or an imitator. 




 Serra takes off his NWO shirt to reveal that it's mike Tyson underneath! 




 We put all the pressure of Belfour's Stanley cup on Turco's shoulders, and for years gave him a defense that consisted of an elite Zubov and a handful of spares. The defense never got back to the Hatcher/Matvichuk and Zubov/Sydor era. Hell, even a slow plodding Ludwig/Chambers type pairing would have helped Turco a shit load. 




 Belfour seriously spoiled us.  We've been expecting too much from our G's since he left, without offering them any help along the way. 




 I have in in dynasty.  The twins will probably give him some time to re-adjust after surgery.  Maybe after the all star break? 









 STOP YOUR LOGIC RAPE! 




 THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT WINDOW PAIN! 




 Auction draft is best draft. Eliminates the luck factor of draft position. 




 I thought everyone agreed that it should always be white lettering with black borders. 









 DON'T TRY PAWNING OFF YOUR FAKE SHIT HOMEOPATHIC MACHIDA PISS TO ME!!! 




 better post that idiot bear that doesn't confess anything 




 every week?  Let's tone down the exaggeration a bit. 




 Also, she would make a great mom. 




 Vote for Pedro and all your wildest dreams will come true. 




 What's to understand?  Hot latinas dancing in bikinis was the whole premise of the show, right? 




 Do either of you have proof?  Because that looks pretty famine like to me, and not really a war zone. 




 The dyed hair:  calling card of irrational attention seekers. 




 WTF?  That's seriously fucked up. 




 Print out that web page and put it [on his door](https://rearwindowethx.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/knife-in-door.jpg) 




 At all. You think Anderson gets bored in his fights now? This shit will drive him insane. He'll want to break his own fucking leg. 




 Hahahahahaha!

You're a riot, Maury 




 Man, this guy laughs at everything.  It would be awesome to work for a guy like this. 














 Gonna give up after one little resurrection? 




 how did you land that job in the US? 




 ERA?  One major constitutes the beginning of an era? 




 probably the whole country.  We're too sensitive to have any fun anymore. 




 but also the toes, right? 




 Stars aren't in.  Hate the redwings. Yoga pants it is! 




 This was my hardest cut in my dynasty league, because he's been the anchor of a solid rotation for me.  But seeing his fastball not get over 85 is just too much to bear. 




 RIP in peace, OP's shit. 




 Just stick something up there and post pics. 




 wow. you're obviously not an ordinary 15 year old. 




 le mayo 














 They were rolling with a joke being made by sports radio guys. Just like any other twenty something year old would do. 




 Well then 




 He's gonna sign with Bellator just to kick Kongo in the nuts. 




 He didn't do anything. He simply implied that his wife is also slow at things. 




 It's that easy, buzzfeed. All you have to do is ask, and properly credit the OP. This lady is a good example for every journalist to follow. 



















 This is fucking solid.  Now, to get more attention to it, put it in an imgur link and post it to /r/funny, because that's where non funny stuff goes for attention. 




 He should move up to 185 and fight Lyoto in a Karate vs. Karate match.  Lyoto would probably still be undersized, lol. 




 Seriously. Thus is the most spoiled and entitled attitude he can possibly take. If this person is indicative of the current generation, thus country is fucked. Don't forget to complain that Mexicans are taking all the jobs after you refuse those jobs because they're beneath you. 




 that's pretty much /r/progresspics in a nutshell.  Fat guy loses 180 pounds?  200 upvotes.  Cute girl loses 15 pounds?  3000 upvotes. 




 haha. ok, now that's pretty funny 




 Never heard of coke belly.  Always thought it was HGH gut. 









 Uriah Faber anyone?  Sure he was WEC champ, but the UFC strap has eluded him a few times. I truly believe he is the second best fighter in two different divisions.  Which sucks for him. 




 That looks like a champion to me. 




 Lol, poor OP thought his [serious] tag actually meant something here. 




 Well, Lyoto is a champion, so that comparison is not exactly fair. 




 If there was no ref on that day of the fight

wut?

That's literally the stupidest thing I've ever read on this sub. 




 Can't really hate on Daron for wanting a more active role, though.  He also has a great fucking voice.  For me, they went from being a band with one lead singer to a band with two leads. 




 System really did a great job of blurring the lines. 




 so, typical AMA then? 














 C-C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!! 














 Yeah, I love that they chose the cleaviest pic they could find.  Like there aren't other pictures of her out there. 




 a relatively successful internet message board

Either you're trolling with intentional density or you weren't around when major events happen on Reddit.  The Presidents of the United States, as well as many other countries have come on to do AMAs on this website.  Politicians, movie star, musicians, and revolutionaries have used this site as a platform for launching bigger projects.  But yeah, Reddit is relatively successful, I guess. 




 Yeah, for comparison, check him out in Southland Tales.  He was probably 240 in that.  In this movie, he's definitely over 280.

[Pain and Gain](http://cdn.wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-dwayne-johnson-2013-588x400-529x360.png)

A different movie, but still, you get the point. 




 Wait, so a job seeker can contact a recruiter?  I always thought it was the other way around. 









 This is interesting.  I had honestly not thought about it,  I always thought it would be harder to set up shop in a different country. 




 Wow, thanks. 




 Honestly, I don't know anything about NGOs.  Do I just google "NGOs in India" or something?  Is there an international organization that you have to apply through? 




 Sorry about that.
I'm in the U.S., and honestly would look to move anywhere.  Third world countries are doable for me.

I'm interested in any kind of job, really.  I'm stuck in a dead end job at the moment, with absolutely no prospects of advancements, in one of the most expensive markets in the country.  I will not be able to save money if I live here long term.

My work experience is varied, but always with small business.  I started out with a small computer store, which did mainly tech support and custom machines.  I worked for a medical equipment company, and now am in the jewelry business.  Basically, everywhere I went, I helped the company grow by actively taking a management role with a lot of responsibilities under me.  I ended up leaving each company because they were family businesses.  The problem is, that this is all I know how to do now.  I have no corporate or government experience what so ever.

I speak English and Urdu fluently.  But I am only literate in English.  I would definitely be willing to learn a new language for the right opportunity.

Is age a factor?  34M 




 Will carrying the Humvees like that fuck them up?  Stacked together, with seemingly no barrier between them? 




 I have a degree in Economics, and I've worked for small businesses for the past 15 years.  Some of those, I ran on my own.  Is there any demand for someone with that kind of experience? 














 So no one is willing to consider that Kari might be over rated? 




 nepotism  




 Comments that ask to push other comments to the top are fucking stupid. 




 Post all the censored news stories about her here.  People will see the cross posts. 




 So, since the white bread was already baked, does the double baking not ruin or burn it? 




 I know nothing of bakery and am quite frankly disappointed that no one has explained how this happened. 




 Her best role? 




 Not a confession. This bear has been raped worse than that poor wolf. 




 Submit the request to /r/upvotegifs 




 That guy is married to a muslim?  Wow. 




 I'm a Cowboys fan, and I fucking loved that shit.

Later on, not then. 




 What is ritual nudity? I need picture explanations to fully understand. Videos if possible. 




 I hope she doesn't get off on some bullshit affluenza defense 




 But you guys like Jimmy Johnson, right? 




 TBLOP sucks now.  They took off the list of porn forums for some reason.  Porn forums are the best. 




 HBO's Deadwood thinks that's cute. 




 **WHAT'S THE FUCKING SITE, OP?** 




 Even worse is the retard brigade that gets this shit to the front page. 




 WHAT? 









 Jesus Christ.  I almost forgot.  Thanks for the reminder. 




 Yes, the ref and nick Diaz both saw the end coming at the same time. But nick didn't wait for the ref. It's like, just in case the ref wasn't gonna stop it, nick was. 














 shut up 









 Well, it was illegally redistricted in 2002 in a non census year. 




 What a fat fuck.  I'm supposed to believe that this tub of lard is supposed to keep society safe from the criminal element?  What a fucking joke. 




 Elderly driver? 




 I especially liked her more because she pissed off Ronda's team so much and beat the shit out of Bazler after all that shit talk. 




 The fight that's not gonna happen, according to Chael? 




 The most responsible decision a Diaz brother has ever made.  He saved his brother a ton of hurt, and possibly extended his career. 




 Even funnier is the defenseman portion of the curve.  Trying to branch off or something. 









 subbed.  amirite? 




 Seriously, I don't understand why Google nerfed their image and video search results like that. 




 Bruh, it's always been a thing. 




 Fucking GOAT! 




 He really should be the highest voted one, since he is a primary inspiration of this sub. 




 I'm actually surprised that it only has 112 million views. 




 A few games?  I remember when players used to get suspended for 20 game stretches that extended into the playoffs and the next season for shit like this. 




 OH YOU HAVE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION DO YOU?  YOU BETTER CONFESS THAT SHIT, HOMIE. 




 Same fucking boat.  On top of that, when we travel we work 7 days. 




 Sounds reasonable. 




 That's some fucked up shit.  You don't have to like a guy, but you have to be an absolute piece of shit to want to watch someone's career end due to a gruesome injury in the octagon.  Fuck yourself. 




 The harmless label is being peeled back a little on HGH.  It is after all, a growth hormone.  It causes everything to grow, including your internal organs.  Google "bodybuilder HGH gut" and you'll see how harmless it is. 




 It's not free anymore?  I used to use this a few years ago, and it was at the time. 




 This will be reposted to /r/funny by /u/gallowboob.

Probably. 




 That's my specialty. 




 I remember you on TMZ "did I say allegedly?  I meant definitely guilty!"

One of the funniest things I've ever seen. 




 Oh my fucking god.  I would not be shocked either way if this was true, or if this was a long troll being played by the Gangster. 




 You heard it here first, folks! 




 Doesn't get more real than West Lynn 




 Lol, yeah Ted Haggard was the best 




 That's definitely the one. 




 It's quite possible that every single Pride fighter used steroids. 




 Bruce is ten times the announcer that his more famous brother Michael Buffer is. 




 Wow. Calling on Cecil Peoples for help in this one. 




 We're regulated by the government! 




 I downvoted.

/r/conformity 









 What's the word on Hamilton's suspension status? Full year?  a month? 




 only dreams now 




 So now that Truecrypt is dead, what's out there? 




 You could watch it all day.  So perfectly looped. 




 Calling it a dress avoids the need for pants. 




 But then, how would you karma? 




 Quite possibly the best sub remaining on this sinking ship. 




 Is this the Odell Beckham Jr. of frisbee? 




 Ellen pao! 




 Specimen? 




 It's Bill Pullman, you idiot! 




 I don't understand why shitty comments like that are voted up when they clearly add nothing of value. 




 more Hugh Thompson's

No need for a possessive apostrophe.
