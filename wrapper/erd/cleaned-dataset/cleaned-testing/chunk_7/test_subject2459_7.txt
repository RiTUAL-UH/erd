 I like it. Then there's the issue of obscurity. The aldmeri dominion is the only "alliance" which remains after the interegnum. This is easily dismissed as it is known that the alliances fell apart when Talos took control but why were they never, ever mentioned in any lore book? Surely someone would have written about the pact or covenant. 




 I always here about full moons and new moons etc and yes the game does have a lunar cycle and from what I can tell it increases their chances of spawning but they can and do spawn no matter the moon phase. 

I am a werewolf and was bitten by an npc wolf the night after a new moon. I have seen countless wolves and blood fiends virtually every night. Lunar cycles don't matter! 




 For example, it was said that Cyrodiil used to be a jungle province until Tiber Septim reigned and leveled it during his conquering of tamriel. Yet in the game it is just as it was in oblivion.

 




 Don't get me wrong I love eso and I love the entire series but zenimax did screw up some of the lore, sure they tried to explain it but the only people that buy it are those that have never played any other games in the series. 

If you played and completed Daggerfall then you will remember that there were multiple endings to the story, Bethesda made it so they all happened, technically. Using a dragon break they made it so it was possible that any of them could have happened. 


Any way Bethesda could use a dragon break to explain the faults in the lore in the next game.
 




 Do you believe that we are better than other species? 




 I wonder, if you believe in evolution, if web will evolve any further as we no longer have a need. When animals change climate etc they evolve to survive there but we don't. We, rather than say growing fur, build a house and put a heater inside. 




 I maybe wasn't clear. I mean are we above other species or equal? Read [this](http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/basking-shark) 

The poet questions if we're justified in thinking that were above all others and wonders this because we have done so much damage whereas animals, like the basking shark, don't cause any trouble yet we think we're better than them. 




 Do you think we're above all other species? Do you think we're too arrogant? Do you believe in basic human goodness? Are we all "evil" inside? Tell me your thoughts. 




 I am young but since I was younger than I can remember I always wanted to be a medical doctor. I was inspired by my doctors who I saw regularly because of asthma and my twins doctors as he has cerebral palsy (only slightly). 

Anyway I truly believed that's what I wanted untill only recently when I sat and really thought about where I was headed in life. I considered archaeology as history is my favorite subject and I could talk about it forever. Then I spoke with archaeologists and spent time in their company it was... enjoyable but not for me. Then it occurred to me - - history teacher. And I'm now working towards that goal.  




 ENGLAND! 




 There are 10 types of people in this world: those who understand binary and those who don't. 




 "There are many fates worse than death". This can also be said for murder and crimes. 

Take rape for example. Let's say a woman is raped she will likely have a very difficult time recovering from the physical and mental trauma and even then she will have a tough time getting intimate with someone. It can often ruin lives.

Then again look at child abuse-be it physical, mental or sexual. I read a book once about a young boy in the states. The name currently alludes me. I don't generally read these kinds of books but it came recommend to me by a family member and it was relatively short. 

It told the (true) story of a young boy who's mum started abusing him. He stressed how she and his father had once loved him and his brothers but the father began to drink and the mother began to abuse only him. She would beat him, starve him, force him to do things no person, let alone child should have to do. 

This is evil. To do this to anyone is wrong but child abuse is simply evil.

 




 I don't care it doesn't hurt me but it gets annoying all of the shit on tv and the internet.  




 Oh I loved her this season. Especially when she was writing "space hump chronicles" :D 




 Oh, sorry never thought of that. Of course I'll do it now. 




 Oh I agree, I always wondered about her. 




 Victims: 

Tell us what happened. Who bullied you (avoid real names). Did you and your bully ever make amends?


Bullies:

Why did you bully people? What happened? Did you ever make amends?
 




 Awesome, I never even thought to check for that sub reddit. 




 God this has been asked a million times! I like xbox. 




 I actually haven't checked, weirdly cause I absolutely love it!! 









 Is it ok if I roofie you? 




 You can't play as them in the standard edition so it's more of a status thing. 




 Well they're special because they were playable in all past games but due to the storyline they're kind of different due to the fact that the three alliances are fighting for control over their land -- Cyrodiil.

As for you wanting to go to borrowings you will have to reach level 50. Since you chose the Daggerfall covenant you begin in their controlled area. At level ten you get cyrodiil and as you progress you get more of your own controlled land but at level 50 the entire Mao will become traversable. 




 Hey all, me and my friend play on the European server and would love some players to play with. We're both from scotland and are open to voice chat. Both of us have played plenty of elder scrolls in the past so we know the lore.


We play in the ebonheart pact. I am a female dark elf and he is a male nord. I mainly focus on magic (dark magic, daedric summoning and storm calling). He is a nightblade who focuses on close combat (siphoning, assassination and shadow). We would like a cleric of sorts but we honestly don't care what you play as or focus on we just want to have fun completing the dungeons and playing the game. Also we don't care what level you are.


If you want to play with us feel free to message me on Xbox:


Devlin Fr3w99


I hope some of you get in touch but if not I hope you have fun playing anyway. 









 Don't reset after a wet dream. You can't control them but don't continue after you wake  up. Just let them pass and they'll stop. 




 s. puedo cambiar mi acento cuando hablo en lnea con amigos que viven en otros lugares , por ejemplo en Xbox 




 You too friend :) 




 Ja, ja , eso es gracioso cuando la gente no entiende . A menudo sucede debido a mi acento 




 Escocia. De donde eres? 




 Buenas fiestas a todos! 




 Tres bien merci. Qu en pensez-vous? 




 Ha, ha I love how you guys can have bbqs year round. I have family who emigrated there around ten years ago and they absolutely love it. 




 Ha another scot happy eater :) 




 It's up near the top right. It says start a conversation. 




 Ha, ha oh my god that's bad. Good luck explaining to him. 




 And to you! :) 




 Hi, I can give you a pretty great one, in my opinion anyway. I was a kid when I heard of this and it scared me for weeks but not so much anymore.

It's called: "Kuchisake Onna". It's an urban legend about a woman who's husband became increasingly jealous of her infidelity, he thought she was cheating. So he decided to take her beauty away from her by slitting her mouth from ear to ear giving her a permanent "smile", much like the joker in batman. He then killed her and she became a ghost.

I read about it in detail when I was younger it's kind of interesting.

I won't write the whole story but if you think it sounds good you can read it [here](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Kuchisake-Onna) but that version is pretty short. 




 Wow we like a lot of the same areas of history. I suggest you go down to your nearesg library and go to the history section. I still love doing that. You can find some great stuff on almost all of the areas you listed. If you want me to list books I will happily. 




 It's Easter here in Scotland. 




 Aaaw but at least she learned how to lock pick. 




 Even though this is funny your forgetting that 2013 was a prequel to all oth e  games so she's is older on the right and is looking at the left and saying it's hideous. 




 Ha, ha! :D I love tomb raider and don't get me wrong this is funny but it was not fast! She changed gradually and her peak was around underworld but in 2013 and rise of the tomb raider she looks amazing! 




 Ok that sounds like fun. 




 Or Passover or whatever you celebrate at this time of year. I hope you enjoy your day/week.  




 Wow. I hope everything turns out ok OP. Update us soon, if it's not to inconvenient. I know you have said on multiple occasions that you have renounced god and Jesus but, if it's ok with you, I  like to say a prayer for you and your daughter? (Don't worry I won't write it :) )  




 Thanks for that but I don't think it's that since that headache was very short and according to that they last pretty long. 

I think I might've over reacted cause today it's not nearly as bad as it was. When I shake my head now it hurts a bit but I think it'll go away. If it doesn't go away within a couple of hours I'll go to a doctor just to be safe. 




 Why get the money in gbp? 




 Ha, ha I was sorted into ravenclaw on pottermore and every quiz and reading the books I always related to ravenclaw more than any other house. 




 That way you'd make it to 65 at least. 




 Northeast Africa, southwest Asia. 




 If you give up ten you would live up to at least 75, not bad. 




 So I woke up and I never noticed immediately but my left I was pretty sore. Yesterday I got a very short headache (incase it's related). 

I can't stand up fast or move my head fast without pain. It's at the back of my eye and its pretty painful whenever I move too fast. It hurts the back of the eye and the top of my head. 

Also earlier I saw some parts of my eyesight as blurry, kind if hard to describe. I had to really focus to see certain things. For example look straight ahead then very slightly down and to the right. I couldn't see there. 

I haven't been to the opticians in a while but I'm going soon please tell me if this is serious. 




 No, I meant after giving away one year you get a total of one million after giving up two you have a total of two, not three if you know what I mean? I understand how you thought I meant what you did.  




 Ha, ha :) it would be hard to end your life younger than it should be for something as, fake? As money but you have to admit it's importance in our world so I'd give  up maybe one year. 




 That makes sense you get 4m and still reach 80 years or so. Pretty decent. 




 That's reasonable. 




 So what would you trade knowing you'll love to 85 before you gave away any years? 




 Yeah let's just assume you will at least reach 85 and you will still be ignorant to the date  and year 




 Ok that's reasonable. 




 45 is still pretty young and fifteen years is a long time. I don't think I could ever give that up. 




 It's absolute so you can't like invest it then buy extra years and still be to h. When the trade is done its done. 




 Let's just say you will reach age 85 before you make the trade. 




 Do you mean 3 years or 2 million? 




 I think I'd say that too. So much can happen in a year but maybe I'd give up one  of my older, older years. 




 Yeah sure, half a year = half a million. Not to bad. 




 Wow, that was... disturbing? 




 ***EDIT 1*** Lets just assume that you will live untill you turn 85 years old and then after that you can die at any point. So you could die straight away or live another 20 years. It is absolute so when you make the trade it's done for good. 




 Not black per say. They weren't white or black they were a dark tan shade. Closer to black than white but kind of middle eastern looking, which makes since they live in the mid east.  




 I believe so. During the Scottish wars of independence William Wallace fought for our country (please don't take  everything you know of him from the movie braveheart as it is very historically inaccurate). Here he was considered a hero. He helped rid the country, temporarily, of English rule. However, in England he was considered a terrorist.



So to answer your question I think yes but it's very dependent. I do think it's rare however as most terrorists are unjustified and cruel but then again it depends on what you consider a terrorist. 

 




 I think smart phones. Using face time or even just calling someone would amaze them. 




 They've all had pretty terrible deaths, sad. 




 Half of us (Scottish people) are gladly run by fucking English dicks! I hate the English government and want to be  independent but we're the only country to have turned it down while others die for it. 




 Look at the people in the background, it's a painting. 




 I know what you mean but everyone should be able to love their country without shame. When I leave my country for long periods I start missing it a lot. It's this love for a country and everyone deserves to have this. I don't run around shouting woohoo Scotland!! But I do like knowing that I can be and am proud to be from here.  




 Easter :) Enjoy your week  




 The other day I wrote a post which someone reposted an  I see stuff like this all the time. Why do you guys do it? 




 Yeah cause this isn't a repost 




 That's horrible. You've lived quite a life and I wish you many more years of happiness and joy. 




 I'm sorry you all have to feel that way for what happened in the past. It's not your fault nor your grandmas. I hope one day soon Germany will get its patriotic pride back. 




 That's sad. I've read of people losing their entire life savings. Can I ask, if you don't mind, what he felt, thought or said when the new rentenmark came to be and he knew his money would never be worth anything again? 




 Not German but I've studied this in depth. Her answer will be better if they get a chance to answer you since there are so many comments.

Many people were against Jewish people even before the war, they were thought of as "the old enemy of Germany". Hitler, being a master of propaganda, used this hate for his own good. He made the Germans and anyone who opposed him look weak, greedy and selfish, only caring about themselves rather than the greater good of Germany.

Hitler was also very good to the German people. He provided free day trips and helped end poverty in Germany almost every person of age had a job of some sort. 

People never saw him as evil because he did things that were good for them and his speeches were very hypnotic, in a sense that he was a great speaker. You also have to remember that he came to power during a very tough time for Germany so they got on board with some of his more radical policies. 

Many people were ok with what was going on with the Jews because of their pre existing hatred for them and the propaganda that they couldn't escape. That's not to say some people weren't opposed to what was going on but speaking out was dangerous.

There are detailed cases of people being against Hitler's ways. One woman who's name alludes me made brochures of sorts and handed them out but she was only one woman and brochures took a long time to make. Communists were against him but like the Jews they were imprisoned and anyone else who had any doubts kept them mostly to themselves for fear for what would happen to them or their loved ones. 

If they wanted a peaceful life in Nazi Germany they wouldn't speak against anything. They would hail Hitler when they passed in the streets, they would have a copy of his book "mein kampf" on their table when they were having company and they would make sure their children attended the youth programmes put in place by Hitler. 




 Your grandma seems like a great woman. I only have a couple of questions:

Did she join/was she forced to join the league of German maidens

What did she think of the state of Germany post wall street crash 1929? And then what did she think after Hitler rose to power and provided the country with his new social, economic and political policies? 




 Wow. Great job she sounds like a real bitch. I love how you handled the whole thing. 




 I think your dead... to your wife.

Just kidding go and talk to her and see why she did it. 




 Wow. What a beautiful painting. 




 Are you from the US cause it's supposed to be very, very common there. 









 What the fuck! Jesus Christ that's just wrong! Tell them no. 




 Prostitute 














 Yes!! I knew it. I knew I wasn't a sleeper agent! 




 I've the idea but I think th  game would be better with your story and character creation etc but with maybe 4-8 player co-op rather than a full blown mmo. 




 I see a map. 




 I say bith. I just kind of say them as they happen but I think most commonly I say day-tuh. 




 Happy Passover to all of you who celebrate it :) 




 How do I know I'm not a Russian sleeper agent??  




 Ha, ha now I'm scared. How do you know I'm not a Russian sleeper agent? 




 Wow! They are so lucky to be alive. Hopefully they'll learn to drive a bit slower. 




 Ha, ha I guess I never thought about where you live :) 




 I always thought they were like earth popping a spot. 




 Oh yeah! I never noticed that before. 




 Not necessarily. If I saw you now and said goodbye then died on my own in my house it would likely be a family member who would see me dead first. 




 Ha, ha don't worry about it :) 

I've always wanted to visit the US since I've  been all around Europe. I'd like to go to NYC, California (LA), Florida and a few other states. 

Have you been anywhere outside of the US 




 It will never happen were they are all immune to antibiotics but if it did most of humanity would die out and the ones who survived would have stronger immune systems than ever before after years of adapting but still life would be a pretty huge fight. 




 No I just say a prayer at night time, oh I meant pray ha, ha autocorrect. 




 I go to chapel when I can but I don't force it, I prey in times of need and thanks (I normally prey every night). Online I try not to say or do anything I wouldn't do offline and then the rest of my day is just a normal day by all standards. 




 Those that know binary and those that don't! 




 Well quite a lot of them are younger gamers who weren't playing games when they were released and so they never played them. Then they see people doing it on the internet and they've heard of the game so they just go along with it. 




 I don't know any racists per say. I've heard people say a racist remark every now and then but they've straight away apologised and you can tell it is a genuine apology. I'm white but I have many friends of different races. Skin colour isn't a choice, the way you act is. 

It's pretty incredible to see how far the US has come. This time 50 odd years ago black people were considered to be disgusting sub humans. I mean it should never have been like that but at least the problem has been mostly rectified. 




 Wow that's a great find. I can't imagine how horrible life was like for most African Americans in those times. It messed many of them up socially and economically for life and for their generations to come. 




 Yeah I love it here. Like most people my country is the best in the world ;) in my opinion. Yeah it's nice, good cities nice countrysides and it's a generally friendly country. 




 Yeah but when shortened it is common to put WWII for world war two as the II is the Roman numeral for two. 




 You are inconsistent. 




 Ha, ha apparently so. I'm from Scotland it's not nearly as common here. 




 Sorry that is terrible but why did you put IIWW rather than WWII?
