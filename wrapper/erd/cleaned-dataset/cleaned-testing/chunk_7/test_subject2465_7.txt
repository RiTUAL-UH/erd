 This is a national security issue 














 Like Obama said, it goes beyond publicly calling people "niggers" 




 I like that.

In all honesty, this flag could literally change the economy in mississippi 




 Nah. Lets just promote a period of treason and racism instead.  




 Uh...THE KU KLUX KLAN...did you miss that?

 Mind you, he didn't use the opportunity to blatantly call himself a christian when he said this. he just kept rolling on the tape and didn't address any part of his "faith"  




 He's written about only being drawn to the sense of community in churches, i.e. activism, not the actual theological superstition. He wrote about it in the Audacity of Hope. I even quoted it for you. 









 Gotta have "science" first 




 Hey Reddit, Looks like I found the white supremacist! 




 Do you realize how many non-american actors there are currently?

Even the lead for the new Star Wars is a british actor 




 Are you a trained fighter?

No?

So what are you arguing about? 




 When the President drops the n-word, people listen 




 thats PROVEN 18.

its probably closer to 50...which is insane 


































 Also...TV actors are putting up serious competitin 




 wouldn't wanna see those quarterly earnings... 





























 i'd be happy if he was never on again 




 Not that Im against gay marriage, because i'm not, but their argument is that its still heterosexual interaction at the end of the day.

But I agree with you 




 its said he was worth 70B...so... 




 The saudis can actually make this happen since internet access is so limited there 




 The saudis can actually make this happen since internet access is so limited there 



















 Maron has always been more mainstream in his approach. Rogan still has Redban on to talk about penis emissions  




 LOL. Hell no.

For all we know, they probably reached out
 




 wow 









 You have a lot to learn. 




 It would be pretty stupid to lose the presidency by not doing something like pretending to be religious.

its important to a lot of people 




 I'm glad you think millions of racist white supremacists are mentally ill 




 Amazing interview 




 You sure?

Something I wrote a while back when someone said I couldn't "prove" barack is an atheist, or at least really someone who is privately very liberally religious.

 gt;***About his mother*** *"This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part.

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.

Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg


He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.

Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....

Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.

Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. 

He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.

When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)

I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office".

Now you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community. 

Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).

Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.


Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech: 

    gt; *"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth."*

He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.

 Its been well documented that he grew up in secular humanist homes and his grandparents and biological parents were both non-believers. 

During the podcast he remarks on how diverse his religious upbringing was but that the social values of respect and accountability were what he took away from it. And later he even makes a point to say he values reason and facts with every decision.

 probably one who owned slaves? 









 Flying a flag of a country that ceased to exist 150 years ago is not.

Thats being naive. It was a violent secessionist movement that field and represents some of the worst parts of an america that justified oppression of what was nearly half of its population at the time.  




 I.

Don't.

Care.

They failed to fall into line and I don't care how many of your family was apart of this.

They were wrong. They lost. They are now members of the land they wanted to break apart of.  




 was that don draper? 




 This show is precisely the type of high-flying ridiculousness i needed 




 no the hell you don't.  




 There is nothing of benefit to be proud of by acknowledging the antebellum south and all of the connotations associated with it. Its treason.  




 it already WAS used for such a thing

Do you know nothing of the KKK? The civil war? How old are you? Are you even an American?  




 both 









 Don't play dumb here.

Israelis would storm all media outlets with PR blasts if any US politician remotely said any thing about jewish people 




 Theres ONE nation. Whats there to have pride in? A failed revolt? 




 That flag means oppression and racism.

Like that? 




 because political parties flip over time??? are you really this stupid?  




 South Carolina??? 














 I can't help what idiots do on their private property...but having this flag on state grounds is unacceptable 




  As long as that flag isn't on government property...like the stars and bars are in many places 




 On government property, yes.  




 Its illegal to own copies of Jihadist magazines in some countries and their legality is coming under question

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspire_(magazine) 




 there ARE official symbols in this country though...and that flag is not nor ever was one 




 Love them. You can either watch them or not 




 I know we have to avoid the whole "winners write history" problem, but during a civil war, the side that wins...WINS. You don't get to keep showing the colors of a failed state and proclaim that those people were americans who just wanted freedom. No. They were traitors and they lost. Not to mention all the other messed up things associated with that flag.  









 The saudi's military is trash for all the money they spend. 




 their army is pretty trash for the money they spend...

shows theres a difference between being a consumer and a producer 




 I don't give a damn

Black people have gone through hell in this country and avoiding that approaches naivety of epic proportions 




 Its LITERALLY treason to suggest that flag should be supported 




   End the war on drugs and fix our mental health care system.

Racism is a disease white people have suffered from for 400+ years...how do we fix that? 




  If anything we hate ourselves as a people more than other people do

Surely you don't believe this, do you?

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/grim-racist-methods-of-one-brooklyn-landlord.html 




 This is DEFINITELY going to be a black classic 









 It will be, but hey... 














  So I dont defend his beliefs,

Yeah you do
 




 Fear of black virility. White dudes are so scared.  














 I've been waiting for these... 




 Its all downhill from here. 




 Racism is a mental health disease white people have suffered from for 400 years 




 http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/grim-racist-methods-of-one-brooklyn-landlord.html 



















 Its not about liberalism. Its about actual survival. A lot of people submit to white supremacy and racism because they're too scared to speak out against injustice.  




 It never ends.

We have racist cops participating in Klan meetings, we have racist cops shooting at paper targets of black youth for practice, we have websites dedicated to white supremacy and subreddits that condone violence and economic oppression against people of color, and we have a media that refuses to even use the word "terrorism" or use unbiased reporting when it comes to issues addressing overt acts of vengeance against people of color

As a person of color...its tiring to have to defend yourself against all of these barrages on your character, your community and your desire to just be treated as normal. 

We've fought for every war. We've participated in every level of government. We've clawed for respect and justice.

So when will the white community speak out about whats going on in their community?  




 This was enjoyable.  









 Don't forget the complaints about "SJWs" 





























 where has this ever happened?

This legitimized podcasts to a whole new level 




 except the guy said he came to shoot white people?

Are we going to ignore the overt and systematic oppression of black people in this country?  





























 We have a problem with white supremacy 




 No.

Its white terrorism. Period.

Its racially motivated and a hate crime.

Get your head out of your ass 




 People in america really deny the problem of white supremacy 




 How does Reddit allow /r/coontown etc with this? 



















 Of course Reddit is ignoring this 




 Oh, but reddit says theres no race issue
