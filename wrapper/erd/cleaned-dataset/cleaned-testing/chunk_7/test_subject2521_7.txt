 Current state regulations make it impossible to have Brownback removed from office. Signing the petition may seem like a great idea, but it won't be of any use in the long run.

 Why was this just posted to Yahoo? It was discovered over three months ago, as shown via the LiveScience link. For that reason it is not current news, it is old news.

 My English teacher during my senior year of high school was one of the coolest people I've known. He was open to ideas and encouraged creativity, no matter how crazy it might have seemed. 

He only had one flaw, he would return papers weeks, if not even months, after they had been turned in. We wrote a long paper at the beginning of the second semester (January/February) and did not get them back until the night of graduation.

Ran in to him at a party a few years back. He had moved to the same college town to get his Masters. Found out that the reason it took him so long to return papers and have everything graded was due to the fact he had severe depression and teaching was the only thing that kept him going.

He's now married and has a wonderful life doing what he loves.

 Forced labour is included in the statistics for KC. 


Human trafficking for sex just happens to be the fastest growing form of trafficking throughout the US.

The groups involved with the event on Thursday focus on issues concerning 
domestic human trafficking, modern-day slavery, and domestic violence.

 For some reason they've tried to pull strings with the whole 'family approach'. Get the kids to watch and they won't see their drunken parents as a problem.  




 Event this Thursday at Marvin Hall from 7pm - 9pm

Viewing of the documentary "Sex + Money: A National Search for Human Worth" to learn more about the minor trafficking industry in the United States.

 LATTE meets the last Sunday of every month at the Lawrence Public Library. It is dedicated to reaching out to the community and partnering with local organizations to spread awareness of domestic human trafficking and modern-day slavery, in the form of public presentations, forums, and film showings.

If you are interested in learning more about the organization, feel free to check out information provided through the Facebook link. 

KC is the 2nd highest city per capita in the US for human trafficking and incidents have been reported in the city of Lawrence.

 Watching the documentary with people in the community next week at the local university campus. Our weekly discussions focus on human trafficking in our community. We live close to KCKS/ KCMO - KC is the 2nd highest city per capita for human trafficking in the US. Houston, TX is number one.  




 30 and 32. We watched that, too. 




 I get so giddy when I see that they're on sale. Then I realize I have a cheap one that still works.  




 Decided I wanted to try working as a SPED Paraeducator because it would provide insight for later studies of child and adolescent psychology. Anyway, I worked this position through a temp agency. 

After the first few weeks it became clear that most of the teachers were younger than me and I'm 28.

 Striving for the life you would like to live but after every successful part of the journey, something pushes you back to where you were before. Think of it as karma getting you because you wish to succeed, but the universe manipulates your dream and forms it into some sort of never ending torture for the sake of its own entertainment.
 




 Someone should definitely start a company similar to JapanCrate, lets call it BritishCrate, that specializes in all of the delicacies we can't buy here in the U.S. 

Unless Hershey's bans that as well, which would not come as a surprise given their current childish behavior. 




 I do this and still manage to forget my wallet.  




 I doubt I would qualify. I'm able bodied, but finding a job that won't make me sick isn't easy too come by. Loud noises, bright lights, strong odors...anything that can trigger a migraine should be avoided. I'm glad that I had the opportunity as a Paraeducator, but working with kindergartens was just too much. Loved the job, not the noise. 




 My health. Being dizzy makes being productive extremely difficult. As so I'm left feeling pessimistic on a daily basis. I lost my job last week, so that hasn't helped much, and it was due to being dizzy. I hope to go back to school in the fall, but I have spent the past week trying to get ahold of the admissions office and the administrator for the school, and so far nothing. 

My job was working as a SPED Paraeducator at an elementary school. My dream job is to work as an Art Therapist helping children and adolescents.

Shitty health + losing job because of health + awaiting an important phone call = a shitty time

Edit: words




 




 Had that happen last week. Worked at an elementary school as a SPED Paraeducator. Every Wednesday we had a collaborative meeting from 13:15-14:30. Right after it was over, I went out in to the hallway and waited for the teachers I usually helped after school - worked until 15:30. 

My boss walks up to me and tells me that we need to go to the Principal's office to discuss the SPED department. Arrive at his office to see that it was just the three of us.

After the meeting ended, I continued to do my job as usual and helped the teachers as I had every day up to that point. One started to cry when she found out I was leaving. I really loved that job and miss working with the kids.

I was fired because of health reasons. I knew working the position might not pan out too well, so I decided to get the job through a temp agency. I have these wonderful things called inner ear disorders. Last semester was great because I was split between every grade. I ended up getting sick during the first week back and missed two days of work. My schedule had me working with a 3rd grade student most of the day, and when I wasn't with her, I spent my time with a kindergarten class. Those times included recess (of which all were indoor that week) and their 'choice time', which is like recess, but the noise level is 100x worse.

 You're welcome 




 I did. I'd ask if they knew what it was. More often than not the answer was no, so I made sure I had the ingredient list ready.

When I was in Play Del Carmen a few years back, none of the bars sold whiskey. I ordered one drink with scotch as a substitution. I immediately regretted that decision and always stuck to the recipe. 




 I'm one of those people. More so use to be...I no longer drink. You'd be surprised how many bartenders have never heard of an Algonquin Cocktail.  




 There's no way to prove this unless that was the only thing they ate in several days. Food you ate a few days ago could just now make you sick.  




 The fact he was able to remove them all at once is quite fascinating.

 Of all the tragedies in the past two decades, that is one of the few celebrity related events I recall the most. I was only 12 years old at the time of his death.  




 I have had family members and friends suggest I write a book. A memoir of sorts. I hope to do this, but I have not quite figured out where to start. 




 The afternoon of May 31st, 1990 I was walking with my babysitter. A teenage driver took her eyes off of the road and hit what she thought was a bump in the road. I was drug 20ft down a dirt road. Resulted in physical and mental impairments. Went from being a cheerful 3year old to someone completely different. Plus I looked...well not normal. People are mean and were mean throughout my childhood and early adult life. I under went 2-3 dozen facial reconstructive surgeries from the age of four until I turned 17. I'll need more in the future for structural reasons. 

Everyone in my family is quite intelligent, except for me. Reasons for that are due in part to the head trauma. I'm not dumb by any means but I'm stuck with limitations that make it difficult to get to where I would like to be. 

My life is great now, but only because I met people who actually cared enough to get to know me. I have two mottos to life: "Be who you are, not what's cool" - Chef from South Park's episode 'South Park is Gay'; and "I've lived a life no one can relate and few will understand."

 




 My health went to shit back in 2008 and I have had inner-ear problems since then. Over the course of several years I lost hope of ever feeling better and stopped doing most things I enjoyed. Now I'm substantially better because I know how to control the problem (took all but 5 years), but I'm afraid to return to what I once loved. I do not want to have to relearn something that once came to me naturally. I also can't run without feeling sick. Running always helped me relieve stress. It hasn't been an option for several years now.

 




 Loved this book. Sat down and didn't want to stop reading. 




 Not get hit by a car when I was three-and-a-half years old would be great. Boy did that fuck up the life I could have had. 




 They're nothing special. Went there once and was really disappointed.  




 The only thing as addictive as crack (excluding caffeine): sugar

A Starbucks Grande 16 fl. oz drink contains 17g of sugar.

A 8.46 fl. oz can of Red Bull contains 27g of sugar.

You would need to consume four cans of Red Bull to reach the amount of caffeine in one Starbucks 16 fl. oz drink....that would also mean you would consumer 108g of sugar. 




 I worked as a Paraeducator for students in a 5th grade class during their math sessions. One student in particular was a brainiac when it came to the subject and seemed to have really enjoyed the subject. Their class had a end of the year celebration on the last day of school and parents were welcome to attend. She played off like she didn't understand the same work she had just completed when her dad asker her about a problem. When I commented on this, her father said she often did this around him. I was left speechless and completely mystified as to why she did this. She has a younger sister in 3rd grade and I often wonder if her sister does the same thing.  




 I read it as noisy kitty and felt sad when the picture loaded.  



















 Correct term usage or not, it would still be nice to receive some sort of compensation.  




 Have you tried vestibular exercises? I don't know the extent of the damage received from the stroke, but that would ensure your inner ear is intact and functioning properly. 




 Why just once a year? Every month should have one day where a city takes time to conserve energy for an hour. Smaller cities could extend the time or number of days, but it would depend upon what the city allows. 


One hour to see the true night sky should be easy to come by. We can survive at least one hour with out unnecessary light. 

The only limitations would be for planes flying. I do not know if that would disrupt their flying; by not being able to see ground lights. 




 We are all on the same boat. Maybe they will offer a minor degree for those who already completed the requirements...then again, that might be asking too much from KU. 


edit: misuse of word 









 That does not mean I have to.  




 It does. Thank You!

 /u/frankwiles I have one question. Will the TEDxLawrence event be free to the public or will it require signing up online to ensure a seat at the event? 









 I know, but I wanted that moment to shine and be like "Ha! I caught you!"

 




 How do you find the original posts? Came across a picture yesterday that I knew was a repost, but had no proof. It ruined my day not being able to do leave the comment. 




 The Jazzhaus is supposedly haunted, but nothing happens until after it closes to the public. 

I knew a few bartenders and they often shared this. I asked to go upstairs and wait for a ride, but they said it was not allowed due to the 'ghost'. 

A room at The Eldridge is said to be haunted, if not a majority of the rooms on the 5th floor.  




 If you visit Stull, you are bound to be arrested. A cop parks nearby and is always on the lookout for 'trespassers', especially during Halloween.  




 Lived in Sigma Nu for a school year...sorority bullsh-t...anyway, the room at the highest point in the house was creepy. I never 'experienced' anything, but the upperclassmen would do their best to scare the sh-t out of us.  




 Art therapy helped me get through my childhood and has made a difference in my life as an adult. So I have a reason to hope for the best when working with people in the future.  




 Maybe to you. I'd much rather do something I enjoy and help make a difference in someone else's life, instead of sitting behind a desk and hating my job.  




 So, I can buy a doctorate from some online "college" and be considered qualified to practice clinical psychology and art therapy just because I have a certification?  

What's the point of all your education and research if your hard-earned MAs don't mean jack? 


--------------------------------------------------------------

How did I miss the point? A PhD is not required for the field.  




 Who said anything about an online degree? It's a highly reputable state university. 




 How does that have to do with competencies? The job I hope to be certified for has nothing to do with working on a computer and in a timely fashion. 

Let me explain myself a little bit more....

I am in the process of obtaining a masters in clinical psychology AND art therapy. My dream job is to provide aid to those who struggle through life by showing them the powers of art - through various mediums. 

Why should I be judged for taking the test format you feel is necessary when it has nothing to do with my desired career? 

People are often left with debilitating circumstances in their lives and deserve to be granted the same opportunities as the able bodied. I didn't ask to receive a TBI as a child and should not be held back by limitations granted through the testing procedures that you find are necessary; when I can qualify for testing that fits my needs. 




 Timed and computerized tests are difficult for those who have certain learning disabilities. When allowed to take a paper version - with or without time extensions - the test taker is allowed a better opportunity when taking the test.

I am one of those people and thanks for insulting my intelligence. 




 There are ways around taking the computerized test. If the test taker has a documented learning disability, they are allowed to use a paper version - this is what I know about the GRE.

If that is not allowed for the GED, then the system will reach a whole new level of screwing people over who wish to better their lives. 

 




 No news reports. Must have been fireworks or a car backfired.  




 Animated gif. would definitely help. Picture does not serve justice.

Also, if this cat does, in fact, have Cerebellar Hypoplasia, thank you so much for caring for the little fur ball. 

 




 Cosplay or slutty Halloween costume? Both? 




 It's the South Korean way of compensating for a small penis.

 Holy sh*t, I did not know Lawrence had a butcher shop. Then again, I'm rarely on Mass.  









 Try the temp agency ExpressPros. If you find a job that you are interested in through their services, you'll be hired to start the next day. 

 




 The article has these wonderful things called links that take you directly to the sources mentioned throughout. Maybe if you actually read it, you would have seen them. 




 I agree and posted the link in disappointment. KU shouldn't be considered a party school. Our state education has gone to shit and the last thing we need is for our state colleges to seem like a complete joke.

/u/bret757 Manhattan/ Aggieville is smaller than Lawrence, yet we are still ranked #1.  














 She's an older cat and this was her first encounter with fleas.  









 I would have guessed you were in Mexico. Small lizards often scurry across the walls and floors. We had that happen at a nice home we rented for a week.  




 This never happens at work. We have a white board hanging on the wall right across from the toilet. If a male employee were to leave the seat up, they'd all know within a short time upon going to the bathroom. Plus there are pictures of the most strict of all the paras hanging around the school. One stares at you when you're in the bathroom. 

tl;dr: use scare tactics or other means of communication to alert those who fail to make peace with the toilet gods. 
  




 Too many college students are still hung over from last night and wouldn't be able to read, nor understand the question being asked. *sigh*
