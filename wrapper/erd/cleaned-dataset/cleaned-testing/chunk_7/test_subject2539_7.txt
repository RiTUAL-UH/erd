 Shit, Zuckerberg barely squeezes in, he was 24 when he became a billionaire. 




 Oh, haven't been there in years. Your description was basically Souhtland mall as well tho 




 Holy shit, are you talking about Southland Mall? 




 Whenever a film gives me the option to make my own ending I go with the positive one. I like to think he won the match, found Cassidy backstage and made out with her as she cried. They then move to jersey together. 




 Why the hell wouldn't they lol 




 Do it next time you have spare time.  




 Past glory, family relationships, and love. Watch it, trust me. 




 Sadness is a great emotion tho. Give it a chance. 




 Or "The Stripper". Marissa Tomei character is basically a female Ram. 




 Never heard of it, is it good? 




 Might be a lot of young guns here who never seen it, it came out in 2008, but The Wrestler is a very good film by a very well respected director, that everyone, fan of wrestling or not, should watch.


Movies about a legend working the independent circuit in high school gyms and similar venues. Best/only good film about pro wrestling. 




 Read 11/22/63. Trust me  




 i hear the door start dividing itslef open. ahhh, the fire departments here "help!!" 




 The movie is fantastic, but not realistic 




 definitely not. maybe it defines certain sub cultures, but not the whole generation.  




 Internal monolgue: was that a Mitch Hedberg joke?

I took the initiative and rang the bell for help. I look towards you and say "damn this sucks" 

What happens next? 




 I feel like such a loser some days when on the previous night I binge watched something on netflix and my first thought during my wake up is "wheres the remote" 




 Any chance you're a hoarder? If you are, set up an eBay account. Sell some shit. 




 A second book. Education is very important. 




 Are their limits to distance traveled? Like if I'm stationed in Japan, can I go on leave to mainland USA? 




 I have never heard of ScholarlyYouth Letter Q 




 **The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, by Michael Chabon**

Good book so far, only a quarter in. Reminds me of The Goldfinch a bit more than it does other Chabon novels. So happy I discover Chabon about a year ago 




 I already set up my navy fed account, would I be able to link it to a credit card and have automatic payments using the RTC payment? 




 I did say thanks first.  




 Yea, grateful that he insulted my critical thinking skills and called me a pussy. Great moderating. 




 Well done. Verrrrry well done. I like the outside black and the inside brown, if there is even of hint of pink I wont eat.  




 The Shield is one of the best tv shows ever and Training Day is one of my favorite movies ever, but I have never read a novel about dirty/crooked cops. Any recommendations?  




 Its not on Netflix, but please, please watch The Shield. Also, Mad Men is a masterpiece work, but its not for everyone. 




 Reading this thread and I must wonder if people here have never tried cookies and cream before. 




 Lashes out? lol 




 Why are you the way you are 




 I'm not in yet dude.. Thanks for the answer though, had to google what PCS was. 




 Cause Americans are really into watching their figure 




 Sign in, your password is the last four numbers of your account number and the last four numbers of your social, so its an 8 digit password. Then it will allow you to make your own password 




 Extensions are two or four years correct? And I can choose which? 




 Have you seen the documentaries on the training before? Shits crazy, make sure you are beyond 'in shape', im in shape, but id end up ringing the bell within the first week. 




 Contract length questions, Navy.

How do sea/shore duty rotations work? Rate I'm going in to is 36/36, so what if I have a month left at a sea command but six months left total in my contract, would I have to go to a new shore command for only five months and then separate or would i just finish out my contract at the current command?  




 Going in as AG soon as an E3, contract is for 4/4 years, my A school is only a three or four months long and there is possibility of going to C school at around the third year of service mark. My questions are: 

Do the 9 months of C school count for the 36 month shore duty tour?

If I attend the C school with only a year left in my contract how much would I need to extend?

How strict are the 36/36 sea/shore rotations? what if I'm at the 35th month of a rotation and my contract is up six months, do I get sent to a new command for the last months of my contract or do I just spend the end of my career at that last command?

I'm reading a book right now and came across this quote, felt fitting for most of us here in DEP or about to do something new: "Forget about what you are escaping from, reserve your anxiety for what you are escaping to" Michael Chabon "The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" 




 No way these type of things aren't done on purpose 




 Are there really "Hooters" (I think that's hoe you spell it) in PA? 




 The millionaire? 




 The keys are great, imagine driving through 100 or so islands to arrive to key west and drink all you want. Mucho seafood as well. Miami sucks imo. All there's is is night clubs and beaches and the people are horrible. 




 Please tell me Antarctica is on the list 




 I forgot what wanderlust meant so I Googled it, and it is now ky favorite word. 




 I'm in the halfway point between Miami Beach and the Florida Keys, a smallish city called Homestead. Only thing to see in homestead is the ghetto and then the mansions. Odd how there can be such a wide discrepancy in wealth just yards away from each other. Back when I was a pizza guy I would routine deliver to a run down apartment building and then a large mansion in a huge plot of land within only minutes of each other.


Honestly the only thing to do in Homestead is to hop on the turnpike and travel south or north.
