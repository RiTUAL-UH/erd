 I quite like chest hair, and the snail trail under the belly button but cannot stand a hairy back! 




 I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting! 




 Thank you :)  




 Usually me just overreacting and being dramatic. Never about anything serious.  




 I've been depressed for a very long time, and I've been with my boyfriend for quite a while now. It's been a a tough time, I won't deny that, it has not been easy and we often argue. Very recently, it's been amazing but last night I spent a few hours laying awake whilst he was dead to the world, and just looked at him and my mind was rattling on about how he should be with someone stable, someone he doesn't have to look after and deal with all the drama. I am actually worrying about whether I should let me go and be with someone 'normal'. I feel like I'm holding him back, and I know I need him, and am completely head over heels for him. I do try hard, but I don't know how much longer I can fool myself with thinking he's actually happy with someone like me. 

I don't know what to do :(  




 I have a very balanced diet, but there is always room for more fruit and veg!:) 

Thanks :)  




 Tell him what you want and want to try, maybe create a checklist of things you'd both enjoy or would enjoy trying and then a list of things that are a complete no no. I usually rate the activity out of 5 when doing checklists so then my SO knows what I enjoy more and what to do regularly. 

I introduced my vanilla boyfriend to this lifestyle by showing him what I liked, showing him techniques and giving him a pain rating every time he hit me. Also, I'd you have an abusive past that he knows about, that could be why he is hesitant...reassure him that it is consensual and you would tell him if boundaries were crossed. 

Initiate things such as put your hair in his hand, lay across his lap in the spanking position, kneel at the door when he comes into your bedroom...

Good luck :) x
