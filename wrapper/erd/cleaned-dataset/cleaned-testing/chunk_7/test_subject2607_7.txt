 In all honesty, I agree for the most part. I still don't use it because I know many people are still offended by it, and they have a right to be. A lot of people don't agree, and I think the n-word still has too much of a negative connotation to be used in a public setting like that, especially at school. 




 I definitely still think it's offensive and not appropriated but I realize that not everyone thinks that way. If you're going to use it, then it should be around friends that you know won't be offended, not a public place. I don't use it ever, but I'm trying to make my point that it's completely different in a public setting like that. I shouldn't even have said that it's  




 I think that it's okay to say around friends and people who you know will not be offended, but it's completely different once you display it in a public area like that. The banner reflected badly on the school and I personally think it should be common sense not to use a racial slur in a senior prank, especially one that is public like that. 




 Seriously? It's using the n-word and that word is offensive in any context. It doesn't matter if it's in a Drake song. It doesn't matter if they "didn't mean" it in a racially offensive way. It's a racial slur and it's not appropriate in any environment. 




 Too much. Always. In every context. 




 I wish my school offered IB.

*sigh* 




 I'm really digging the tie dye one 3 




 In all honesty as much as you guys are joking about it, I do think it was offensive and uncalled for.

EDIT: So I'm getting downvoted for thinking it's offensive to display the n-word in a public place. Uh, okay. 




 Swing Life Away is a GREAT song.

 I'm a sophomore. Hoping to go to Michigan Tech for chemical engineering. 




 I have the SAME problem then wake up with 5 minutes to get out the door. I set 2 different alarms, sleep through them most of the time, AND have my mom wake me up. Still doesn't work. What worked for me was putting in headphones so it blasts the alarm in my ears about 30 minutes before I actually have to be awake. It's horrible and unpleasant but it's the only way. 




 What do you consider a dealbreaker, physically? Is there any kind of personal trait that just makes you find a girl unattractive? 




 Funny and quiet and smart 




 If you're dumb, there's no chance. Even average intelligence is fine but I couldn't be with someone who was just dumb. Also I tend to fall for guys that are kinda cocky and have a big ego and I need to not 




 THOSE THINGS ARE LITERAL SATAN SPAWNS. 




 Please Don't Stop The Rain by Jim Morrison. Beautiful as hell and relevant to me right now and great. 




 Backseat Serenade - All Time Low 




 I woke up and found pizza on the counter 3 




 My mom. Had a borderline mentally abusive mother, and ended up dropping out of college because she couldn't afford it. Met her fair share of abusive guys before my dad. They had me then got divorced but still stayed best friends, even though he was in and out of jail, but then he passed away almost 3 years ago. So she had to raise me almost completely on her own since I was 2, and even though her life had all of these issues, she doesn't dwell on them and she devotes all her time and energy making sure we're happy and comfortable. She never gave up on me, and despite everything she's been through, she's a damn good mother, and I hope to be half the woman she is some day. 




 Tom Cruise 




 Got denied this big leadership thing at my school at my school I've been wanting since 8th grade :c 




 I'm really horribly introverted 

Buuut I'm also a good listener 




 The names Sean and Jose. Unf.

(Really any Hispanic name tbh but mostly Jose) 




 I started really young, probably about 8, but didn't actually "hit" until 13. 




 I think In My Life by The Beatles is super fun to play 




 That sometimes I just want to be alone and not talk to anyone for a while, and it's not because I'm sad or angry or depressed. I just  want alone time once in a while, and that's okay. 




 Pompeii could work 




 Like: I'm really caring and compassionate a lot of the time

Dislike: I'm TOO caring and compassionate a lot of the time 




 Ay 




 Well one time my 8th grade English teacher told me I look like a cartoon character so  




 Me 




 I can't even remember. 




 I have an iPhone 5 because I'm an honorary white girl, and I like the phone and all but the battery doesn't even last 5 periods of the school day. I just spent 40 dollars replacing the battery and that didn't help either. Next phone will probably be a galaxy or something tho. 




 Sleeping, or the song Come On Eileen. That song specifically. 




 3.7, might go down to a 3.6 though after this semester. 




 But that's implied. It's the REASON for dress codes. A lot of schools don't enforce dress codes for boys like they do for girls. At mine, guys can have tank tops with the arm holes so big their nipples are showing, but a girl can't have a tank top with thin straps. As stated above, it is understandable if your ass or boobs are hanging out, but it's ridiculous to send girls home for things like thin straps or lots of thigh showing because it *distracts the poor boys* 




 That's not even remotely what the petition is saying. 




 I realized how toxic certain people in my life are, and it's like a weight off my shoulders :) Also, I got a 95 on my last chem test 




 I want to be a chemical engineer. I love chemistry and I love engineering so it combines my favorite things.  




 Week was awful

Weekend so far is good and I get to drive around 




 YES. Once you find something you love to do and decide "this is what what I want to do with my life," that's the best.

 I Don't Care - Fall Out Boy. Whoops 




 Been there. Worst feeling ever, I know. But I promise it goes away with time and eventually you'll see her like someone else's picture and not care at all. 




 I don't know why I find that so funny. I'm in class and saw that have been giggling to myself for about 30 seconds and everyone thinks mom an idiot 




 When I'm just waking up I'll hear my mom in the other room dropping something and just yelling SHIT or screaming my name to yell at me. My mom doesn't normally have an annoying voice, but when I'm just waking up her voice just irritates me more than anything. Like, it makes me irrationally mad. 




 Where did you get that picture of me?! 




 I'm thinking that my "seasonal depression" that I just stopped taking medication for might not be seasonal. 




 Good luck! That's awesome :) I hope you feel better by then! 




 What the hell. How does one write an 8 page essay on teen culture in the 60's? D: 




 About a 3. Got denied some leadership positions and had a sad night and rough morning. Meh. 




 I have... No idea what that is. 




 That essay looks painful. 




 Not only do I have chipmunk cheeks, but my front two teeth are slightly bigger than the other ones so I look like a literal chipmunk. But I still get mistaken for a lot older than I am so idk  




 I guess so :) thank you! I hope you have a good week too! 




 "Better start this essay!"

 When You Can't Sleep At Night - Of Mice and Men 




 No idea why not the marching band position, but for the other one its because I'm "too quiet" I guess. Even though the girl who has sat next to me in chemistry all year and has never said one word the entire time got accepted. So maybe my application just wasn't good, who knows. Oh well .-. 




 Same here. I think for me it's just that the last 8 months have been so draining and I feel so sick of this school year. I normally do really well and turn in all my homework but these next 5 weeks are going to be pretty awful. I know what you mean. 




 Marching band and this program that's basically like "upperclassmen get assigned a few freshman to make sure they don't majorly fuck up throughout the year". But it's okay because I came home and found Oreos in the pantry. 




 /r/marchingband
/r/frc
/r/wtf

Yup. 




 Basically me the past three weeks I feel your pain 




 I got denied two big leadership positions I've wanted since freshman year today after an already bad week. Not my day tbh 




 SERIOUSLY. It's almost physically painful. 




 My eyes are really cool, they're mostly light green with a tiny bit of brown in the middle and a tiny bit of blue on the outside. But my favorite eye color on other people is dark green or brown. I looove big brown eyes. 




 I draw the line when you bring your best friend and they're sitting next to you. Bonus points if the theater is crowded. 




 How close to her are you? Like how much have you hung out with her before? 




 They're 16. You'd think they'd know better. _ 




 Hell yeah I have. I'm close to the boyfriend's family so my friend and I were invited to his little brother's 12th birthday and we were all in the basement playing video games and I look over and they're sitting on the recliner with a blanket over their lower halves obviously going at it. I went home early.
