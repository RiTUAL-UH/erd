 Isn't that what we did?  




 A very similar thing happened with my 3 month old cousin, only that lady didn't have to stop caring for children. My aunt lobbied our state legislature and got a law passed to allow a judge to prohibit an unlicensed childcare worker from working with children while under investigation for certain criminal acts.  




 What you just said won't be true until all of those groups and distinctions are protected under federal law. Everything you just listed is protected except sexual orientation and identity.  




 Yeah it's really disappointing that Republicans keep blocking this legislation that really should have been passed decades ago.  




 That's a trend that started just before the Civil War when the south argued that a state didn't have the right to refuse to enforce a federal law they didn't agree with (the fugitive slave acts), that the people of a state didn't have the right to prohibit slavery (because slavery should be an "inalienable right"), and again after the war when trying to whitewash what they'd done ("the Civil War was about states rights"). Kinda shows how far we've come. Up to that point the assholes always won.  




 You should have said wealthier parents with more and better connections.  




 They shouldn't. But then again, neither should rhinoceros horn.  




 Oh, is that all? So, soon you'll just need a conceal carry permit to be an armed teacher in the state of Kansas? 




 This is the back door entrance for the religious and ideological nut jobs who want to take over school curriculum. 




 Thanks anyway.  




 Foreign policy is primarily the responsibility of the executive branch. He's the head of state.  




 Got anything that doesn't come from an well known right-wing propaganda outlet?  




 That's what I was thinking. It could lead to peace and not war so therefore it's bad. How are the warhawks gonna drop their payloads if everyone keeps talking about diplomacy and peace?  




 Shhh, that doesn't fit the narrative that low wage workers are the biggest drain on our economy. Stop talking sense, man.  




 Yeah, when there's nothing to be angry about they make shit up.  




 What's bad about it?  




 I think I understand where you're coming from and some people on bikes can certainly be jerks, but I don't think it's difficult to be cautious around bicyclists.  




 I'm not pretending to make a positive identification, but [considering that it could possibly be this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_bark_scorpion) I would at least take it seriously and avoid interacting with them.  




 Considering the current political state throughout most of the world, yes they'd have to be evil.  




 My state, Missouri has plenty of sprawl and shitty drivers as well. If people want to bike they have every right to do so. It's a shitty attitude that hates on someone for being self-propelled.  




 No, they're not. Their status is [vulnerable] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark), not endangered.  




 That's terrible.  




 Yeah, there was some horrible shit that happened to that species, but there are* over 500,000 alive today.  




 No, it's only effective at infecting people when it enters the nasal passageways and sinuses. The digestive tract can almost always take care of it.  




 Is that supposed to be an argument? Did you realize that you were wrong and that's why you've resorted to senseless, ineffective personal insults?  




 Too bad it's from the Daily Mail.  




 Heh, this reminds me of all those years in which everyone blamed the president for high gas prices.  




 A lot of people feel that way.  




 Leave me alone.  




 Nice. Edited your comment to fit your argument. Please leave me alone now.  




 I never argued against GMOs. What was it you were saying about reading?  




 I should have looked at your history before replying to you. Have a nice night, child.  




 Seems like this is a spam account.  




 Bicycling can be a hobby, but first and foremost it's a mode of transportation. Bicyclists have a right to use the roadways and deserve the same respect and consideration as any other travelers, ya prick.  




 Yes this. He didn't even have cigarettes on him at the time.  




 Right. It was never dropped on human beings? It's not still contaminating the soil in those areas to this day is it? What do you think happens when you drop a potent toxin from airplanes? Smart ass. 

 




 It's evil when it's known to be terribly toxic, persistent, and the company knowingly produces it to be used and/or tested on human beings.  




 Yeah lol. Tell that to these [folks] (http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/suit-filed-over-government-test-spraying-in-st-louis-during/article_9bc1fc7d-7093-58a3-b557-0cbac5dc38ab.html) and the countless people affected by [this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange). I'm sure you'll find all of that to be hilarious.  




 Every one of you guys thinks of yourself as a hero. If you need a source, go back to your sub and observe the egos and total lack of empathy for the people you hurt and the damage you cause.  




 It does, doesn't it?  




 I don't need any of that. I can be pissed off at Monsanto for the evil chemicals they've produced and helped the military use on people. No I'm not talking about conspiracy theories, I'm talking about facts that are a matter of public record.  




 Is that for real?

Edit: Thanks for the gold! 




 No it doesn't. If someone says that people with qualities a, b, c, and d are not considered to be x, it does not automatically follow that everyone without qualities a, b, c, and d should be considered to be x. That's faulty logic.  




 But they're not doing any of that. They're removing dissenting opinions or criticisms.  




 Oh, but they are. As well as their fellow cops, the media, and people across the country. Every time a cop shoots someone it's always the same excuse. "I feared for my life". Not only do other officers and police departments buy that shit, but they're offended when someone questions it.  




 I am not a public employee. I have the right to express whatever opinion I like. The police cannot silence me simply because they disagree.  




 Okay. But we're still not talking about public employees.  




 The killers of Tamir Rice, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, James Boyd, John Greer, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, and so many others. Everyone who claims that the police are hero rather than just people doing their jobs or in these cases monsters committing crimes against the American people.  




 No one is stopping you from saying anything. You just can't link directly to the piggy-wiggy sub. That's not censorship.  




 That's public employees. Private citizens on their private time don't have restrictions on their speech. The government cannot abridge their speech.  




 While you're not wrong about there not being a binding legal precedent, a cursory Google search will show that quite a few police departments have deleted their comments section or Facebook page when confronted with this problem. The police are not known for backing down when questioned.  




 A hero doesn't shoot unarmed people. A hero doesn't shoot children. A hero doesn't torture someone to death. A hero doesn't need all of his buddies to cover up his actions and defend him in public.  




 All of the PD Facebook pages I've seen are filled with praise and adulation for police officers and the department. If they're going to have a forum that allows those kinds of posts then they need to allow people to complain or speak out against that with which they disagree.  




 https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3d4dc2/my_local_police_must_be_responding_to_a_pancake/ 




 I can't imagine being in a position in life where I would find it necessary to demonize those who have less than me. People who hate on the poor and needy have their priorities all fucked up. 

Edit:Changed a word.  









 A human body is larger than an inch or so in diameter. Do you know how they ultimately remove concrete in cases like this? Jackhammer and sledgehammers.  









 With so much disparity between the numbers of each population, that's just not possible.  




 I broke the metacarpal above my pinky and I had no idea. I was walking around like that for a couple of days before someone convinced me to go to the hospital.  




 On what grounds should there be leeway? What part of freedom of expression are you having difficulty with? The leeway that PDs have is to choose to not have a comments section. It's a public forum. If they're going to allow one type of speech they have to allow all of it.  




 Maybe you're right. It's still generally accepted that government Facebook pages are public forums and the removal of dissenting comments constitutes a violation of free speech. Those pages do not belong to private individuals, and while they may ultimately belong to Facebook, that company is not conducting the censorship. Public employees are selectively deleting opinions with which they disagree.  




 But isn't that the point? Trump can say all of the awful stuff that hateful Republicans are thinking and Bush can just remain quiet and look moderate in comparison.  




 Don't forget slavery and Jim Crowe!  




 I'm pretty sure that you're allowed to stone her to death if she's not.  




 It's happening! Muwahahahahaaaaa! 




 Something tells me that was purposeful.  




 I can think of a really good reason for advertisers to avoid the LA Times.  




 And why doesn't the bank have to pay taxes on the land their basically sitting on waiting for a profit?  




 http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/12959/HPD-Ordered-to-Pay-31K-over-Censored-Facebook-Comments.aspx

There was another in San Diego that was settled for like $20 and resulted in the police deleting their entire Facebook page.  




 If they're censoring comments that they disagree with then they're going to have a bad time. It's already been ruled that government Facebook pages are a public forum and deleting comments violates the first amendment.  




 There is definitely a race problem in the US, and it's definitely present in our police misconduct/brutality problems, but really the police victimize everyone regardless of race. A closer look would reveal that this is deep down a class problem and unfortunately there are many communities where the majority of black folks are at the lowest level of income.  




 I believe that the position of police officer should require a professional license and professional liability insurance. Then if an officer fucks up their insurance has to pay. Lawless cops would soon find themselves uninsurable and therefore out of a job. If the public chooses to not do anything about this problem then they do, in fact, reap what they sow. Fix the system or learn to cope. Take from that what you want. 




 Now do you have a source on that? Here's an actual documented Lyndon Johnson quote:

"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you." ~ 




 I think so too. It, would put an end to this speculation, it wouldn't destroy the parking lot, and it would minimally disturb any evidence that might be discovered. A lot of people want to know what's down there and dammit those girls deserve justice.  




 I feel like there are going be some big bumps on the road ahead for Reddit. Along the way, there are some very aggressive implied promises being made to the community  in comments to mods, quotes from board members and theyre going have some pretty big challenges in meeting those implied promises.

I'd say. They just lost their head engineer.  




 This shouldn't be surprising. There aren't nearly as* many politicians and corrupt wealthy people as there are normal citizens relatively speaking. This information is misleading, really. A politician who works for the public should not be able to wipe away history. They're public employees and what they do affects everyone else.  




 I've seen an officer on Cold Case Files take a pole with him into a forest and push it into the soil where he thought there were remains. When he found them the odor was obvious and he then knew where to dig. 

I'm not sure how common this practice is, but it's certainly better than not looking at all. It wouldn't necessarily be that disruptive to the scene.  




 That's not necessarily true. Search teams often use this method for finding remains in the forest. The hole only has to be an inch of two in diameter.  




 And the taxpayers should continue to pay until they do something about it.  




 The problems with the Catholic Church come from the fact that the organization did nothing to stop abusers and they require celibacy from their priests.  




 Couldn't they make bore holes in the areas in question? If it's nothing, fill it in and be done with it.  




 I agree.  




 Yeah, this is a terrible case of abuse.  




 Mathew 25: 46 Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.

Is that not hell? Eternal punishment? 

You too have a nice night.  




 [No true Scotsman eh?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman). True Christians don't believe in hell because you don't believe in hell.  




 I'm done talking to you as you have nothing to say.  




 What are you even talking about? This article is about exactly what I'm talking about. Treating people fairly and not excluding their for their private lives.  




 The majority of Christians don't believe in hell as an actual place? That's bullshit. I live right smack dab in the middle of Christian America and I can assure you that you're wrong. Every one of these people believe I'm going to burn in hell for eternity and they feel intense Schadenfreude at the mere idea. 

No I quoted two* different parts. The big Mathew part was comprised of consecutive passages, granted the formatting sucked, but it was one part of the scripture. I don't think it's morally sound to turn your back on family because they don't believe the same things you do. The last part about losing one's life for Christ and achieving eternal life sounds an awful lot like the martyrs of islam.  




 I don't know. Maybe their partner drove them to a meeting? A neighbor kjew they cohabitated and gossip travelled. People shouldn't be expected to hide who they are in order to be accepted unless they're actually doing something wrong. Being LGBT isn't wrong.  




 They were expelled from the group for being homosexual. This isn't a non-issue. When the organization found out about their sexual orientation, they kicked them out.  




 22 Indeed I will cast her (Jezebel) into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.
23 I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.

Matthew 10:32-39New International Version (NIV)

32Whoever acknowledges me before others,I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.33But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.

34Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.35For I have come to turn

a man against his father,
a daughter against her mother,
a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
36a mans enemies will be the members of his own household.[a]

37Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.38Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.39Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.


Let's not forget that all things are forgiven in Christ. So by your beliefs, Jeffrey Dahmer is in the kingdom of God looking down on us right now. As well as any child molester, genocidal maniac, murderer, cannibal, war lord, or any other monster who repents before death. But a Hindu boy who died of cancer at the age of eight is burning in the eternal fire. 

 




 You're right we did have a war over the institution of slavery 150 years ago. Those on both sides cited the bible as their justification. And in those actions they were both absolutely correct. The bible justifies and supports slavery. There are also parts of the bible that instruct followers to treat each other and even nonbelievers with fairness and decency. 

In the time since, the god of Abraham has proceeded to kill off as many as 50% of human pregnancies in their first trimesters. Literally tens of billions of spontaneous abortions. It shouldn't be surprising though, as the bible came with its own set of instructions on how to perform a holy abortion. So gather the kids and open your bible to the book of Numbers chapter 5. It's holy scripture and the word of God, so it has to be good.  




 Forgive me, but what you're describing is like picking corn kernels out of shit because "it's really good corn". The new testament and even the teachings of Christ have blatantly immoral teachings and examples.  




 That doesn't make it any more moral. Thats called a rationalization. If you're killing someone in order to neutralize an immediate threat and to protect innocents, then that's obviously morally sound. If you're murdering someone after the fact in order to effect retribution, that's a rationalization.  




 The user in that link admitted it wasn't his photo. OP claimed he took it and even had some back story about how he had to do it quickly because he didn't want to start any trouble.  




 It's not, but historically the individual chapters are often operated by Christians and Christian organizations. They do require a belief in god or a higher power.  




 Okay I'll give you a few examples. Spring break, Mardi Gras, literally every other movie and TV show in the last fifty or sixty years, until recently the institution of marriage, sporting events, wet t-shirt contests I don't think I need to continue. You're complaining about a few parades that you're absolutely not required to attend. 

No one is interested in being overtly sexual in the Boy Scouts. They simply didn't want to be excluded from the group because of who they are. It's a reasonable request.  




 I'm going to give you another chance. You're intelligent enough to use reddit and type so I'm sure you can think of a few.  




 I don't know. I think we can all agree that murder is immoral. I think we can all agree that slavery is immoral. I'm pretty sure that we all disagree with child rape. Do I really need to go on?  




 What? So by demanding equal rights LGBT people are flaunting their sexuality? Or did you see or hear about something gay that you didn't like, so now you have concluded that all gay people are pushing their sexuality on you? Did it ever occur to you that on any given population there is going to be a spectrum of different personalities, tastes, perspectives, and politics? Do you really have to think that hard to come up with a several examples of heterosexual people openly flaunting their sexuality?  




 I never said that I had the final say. I said that Christianity does not. It's not even close. And yes the bible is filled from end to end with immorality from both god and man, all declared divine and just.  




 It's disappointing that you despise people who simply want to be treated equally and fairly. You need to take a long hard look at yourself pal.  




 I don't disagree with most of what you said but I'd like to point out that while there may be decent little pockets in the new testament, there is plenty that is despicable and wholly immoral. I still stand by my assertion that the bible is a terrible source for morality.  




 All human beings want to live and wish to avoid death so it is immoral to murder them.  




 Not all morality is subjective. There are universal truths to the human experience. People choosing to ignore them doesn't make them any less true.  




 Probably. Or maybe someone who deserves it could end up in the Hudson.  




 Huh? So some of them have different taste than you and that makes them filthy and immoral?  




 I don't disagree. That has little to do with morality and more to do with Christianity and tradition.  




 I meant the United States since that's where I am and that's where the BSA is located.  




 What has stopped this from happening in the past? You don't have a valid argument here.  




 Well to be honest, after looking at it again, I was kind of opposing the idea that moral guidance need exclude LGBT people or nonbelievers. Maybe you weren't saying that it has to be that way, but you did seem to say that this was an unimportant part of the program. There are some moral guidelines that are universal to our society. Do not lie, cheat, steal. Do not kill. Share whenever possible. Treat others fairly. There's no reason that these things can't be taught without demonizing people because they're different.  




 It might if it bankrupts a department or two. It's possible that some jackass might get off his ass and do his job rather than his cronies and superiors losing their jobs. No one wants to end up in the Hudson.  




 I don't think you did. I was adding rather than arguing. Sorry. Maybe I'm a little wound up. Some of these comments in here are just plain old hateful.  




 I dunno. Maybe it's in the NYPD faq.  




 What's intrinsically good about a homophobe? What's intrinsically bad about LGBT people? Where do you get your ideas of morality? Why do you expect and demand all other Americans to be the same as you?  




 There's no "turning" here. LGBT people have been marginalized, demonized, and ostracized for as long as we have been a country. Demanding equal rights and treatment isn't an attack on anyone. It's an affirmation of their humanity.  




 Homophobes tend to be outspoken. I thought it was obvious that OP wasn't just talking about people who silently disagree.  




 But LGBT people aren't automatically immoral just by being who they are. Christianity doesn't have the final say on morality, and honestly the bible is a terrible source for morality.  




 I think you just wanted people to read a story about you pooping.  




 I see nothing wrong with a 40 year old father being involved with a girl scout troop. Correct me if I'm wrong but troop activities are almost always supervised by multiple adults who are usually parents. What difference does gender or sexual orientation make? Homosexuals aren't any more likely to abuse children than heterosexuals. You understand that men aren't all pedophiles right?  




 I remember them mostly being **a lot** of rain and wind. The article describes this one as being about as strong as a level 2 or 3 hurricane so just watch the news and avoid going outside when the news advises against it. They have bilingual news in a lot of places over there. 




 The grand conspiracy to poo poo on the pudding man! 




 [The female mostly eats the male during mating when they're in captivity.] (http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/mantis1.asp)  




 I don't know about that. I don't hear a lot of love for him from conservatives.  




 What the hell was on the jar?  




 Or, it could be because he's a rapist.  




 They could have at least employed an undercover police officer who was wired and armed.  




 Hate isn't a value in a healthy society.  




 I have a kid and I agree with OP. Homosexuals aren't child predators. They're just normal people and should be treated as such. 

Edit: typo  









 I can't wait to hear all of the bitching and moaning about this one. They're going to have to get pretty creative to find a reason to be offended by this.  




 I'm sorry about the PMs. That's uncalled for. I disagree with people and sometimes used some very heated rhetoric, but I don't PM other users or brigade. If they keep it up, report them to the mods and admins. It seems like /r/BCND mods are at the very least interested in preserving this sub and they understand that subs are removed when their users blatantly break the rules. Good luck.  




 Same here. Sorry again for unloading on you.  




 Cars are transportation vehicles. They aren't designed for the sole purpose of killing people. Insurance companies do not call them "accidents". They're called collisions and someone is always held responsible. It's not a good analogy.  




 Oh, yeah. Thanks for turning me around. All I have to do is buy into Trump's disturbed narrative and I can hate too.  




 A lot of that depends on how their trial(s) are conducted. They're obviously guilty of some serious offenses. I personally feel that second degree murder is appropriate. I think all of them should be charged with at least something. 

People see that video and they can't believe it, because it's so terrible. If we're going to have any faith in the system at all, then the men who committed those crimes need to be held accountable. This wasn't simply a case of a lack of training or a field mistake. This was actual malice.  




 What? Arrested and threatened with five years incarceration for an internationally acclaimed artist hanging a few posters in that rancid shithole of a city? Detroit and their fucked up police need to change. Their priorities are all fucked up.  




 I agree that more training is absolutely necessary. I don't want to see any more mentally ill people or police officers harmed. It's an obvious problem and blame is squarely on politicians and officials for not addressing it. 

But the James Boyd case is something different entirely. They used their firearms and shot him, then they used their less lethal stuff and dog to torture him as he lay dying. What those guys did is unforgivable.  




 If the suspect is known to be armed and dangerous then the officer is obviously going to draw his weapon and order the suspect's hands in the air. If the suspect doesn't follow orders, it's not unreasonable that the officer would fear for his life. That's very different than an unarmed man. We're talking about two different things here.  




 There's no such thing as an accidental discharge. A weapon doesn't fire itself. The person holding it is responsible for what it does.  




 Oh, really? And how do you figure? How about instead, we stop attacking countries and killing innocent civilians that aren't threatening us?
