 They'd be better off if they picked one Mexican team and copied it, catering to all of the Mexicans in DC. You:d get all of that team's existing fans and you'd never have to worry about attendance again! Heck, you'd have so many fans you'd be able to build your own stadium in no time!

You're not supposed to leave a mark, either. Meaning, you'll likely just be pissing your wife off if you try and hit her with that.

 This is all completely subjective, but you're treating the supposed non-existence of religion as a fact. 




 And religion has nothing to do with that? I'm pretty sure many religions put the defense and saving of the innocent as a noble cause. 




 You didn't say that, but you're making a false equivalency between Shi'a militias and ISIS/Qaeda. They aren't the same. 

I'm no fan of Shi'a militias as they will often target Sunnis en masse, but they do not copy ISIS tactics nor have they taken slaves nor do they forcibly try to convert people. I can find numerous scholars preaching those things from the Sunni side, even before ISIS ever existed. 

Show me a Shi'a scholar preaching that Sunnis are kafir or that enslaving them or forcibly converting them is ok. The worst you'll likely find is some cursing of the sahaba, which I would agree should be avoided, but even then that in itself is rejected by Iranian and other leading Shi'a authorities.  




  There is no such a thing as Wahhabi.

So the people who follow Muhammad ibn-Abd al-Wahhab are what, then, Salafis? It's just semantics. 

And please find me an example of a Shi'a group declaring Sunnis to be kafirs, because all of the leading Shi'a scholars have straight up prohibited that.  




 So your proof is stuff that hasn't happened yet. I anxiously await the "Shia caliphate" that will invade the surrounding countries and execute the non-Shias. /s 




 In Lebanon, they are allied with Christians, and have pretty much refrained from sectarian bloodshed, even giving aid to Syrian refugees who aren't Shi'a.

 Actually, they are the midst of a good run in the CONCACAF Champions League right now! They just upset Pachuca, a Mexican team, becoming one of the few MLS teams to have defeated a Mexican team in a playoff series. [They did so in dramatic fashion, too](http://www.rds.ca/vid%C3%A9os/soccer/impact/porter-joue-les-h%C3%A9ros-3.1117584) with help from [a kid only playing his second professional game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Porter) in front of 60,000 fans at Stade Olympique. This isn't their usual stadium but is being used in the CCL for a larger crowd because Stade Saputo only seats 20,000. They face Costa Rica's Alajuelense in the semifinals. 

While they were in the lower leagues, they had a tremendous upset in the Canadian Cup and surprisingly clinched a berth in the CCL. Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Impact_%281992%E2%80%932011%29#The_Impact_and_Major_League_Soccer): 

 In 2008, the Montreal Impact won the Canadian Championship, gaining the chance to represent Canada in the CONCACAF Champions League. The tournament features the best teams in all of North and Central America and the Caribbean Islands. The Impact won two legs against Real Estali 10 and 00 to secure a spot in the tournament. Montreal competed then in the group stage where they defeated Joe Public FC of Trinidad 20 and 41 and CD Olimpia of Honduras 21 and 11. They finished off against Atlante FC of Mexico which they tied 00 and then lost 21.

 On February 25, 2009, the team won the first leg of the quarterfinals match 20 against Santos Laguna from Mexico. The match was played at Montreal's Olympic Stadium in front of a club-record crowd of 55,571. The second leg was held on March 5, 2009 at Corona Stadium, in Torreon, Mexico, where the Impact led 21 at the half (41 on aggregate). With the Impact only a few minutes from a semi-final berth, Santos Laguna's Carlos Quintero scored twice in stoppage time to rally the homeside to a 52 victory, thus eliminating the Impact from the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League 54 on aggregate. Following the match, head coach John Limniatis commented that his side "should have done better", noting that it was "unfortunate to finish this way".

Since 2012, the Impact made the playoffs once, in 2013, despite struggling through the second half of the regular season. [They were eliminated in humiliating fashion by Houston 3-0](http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-10-31-houston-dynamo-vs-montreal-impact/recap). 

[They have a nice new stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saputo_Stadium), but their owner, Joey Saputo, is a bit impulsive, having gone through three managers within the team's first three years in the league. Saputo, an Italian-Canadian, also has a reputation for signing Italians, even older ones. Marco Di Vaio, Matteo Ferrari, and Alessandro Nesta have all played here.

The only Italian now is Marco Donadel, who is new this year. Right now their best players are him, Laurent Cimian (Belgian International defender who is also new), Ignacio Piatti (Argentinian, the team's lone designated player, which means he is paid very well) the underrated Justin Mapp, captain Patrice Bernier, new arrival Eric Alexander (also underrated), Jack McInerney and Dilly Duka. 

The season has a lot of question marks as their chief offensive weapon, Di Vaio, has retired, and they already lost to DC United earlier today.* Judging by their CCL performance, they seem to be much improved from last season, where they didn't even make the playoffs. While I don't think they are title contenders, they do have a shot to make the playoffs and surprise some people. Their owner has a willingness to spend some money (he also owns Bologna FC in Italy) and their coach, Frank Klopas, is a veteran coach and player. 

Hope this helps!

 Since you're Brazilian, I'd normally suggest Orlando City, as they have a Brazilian owner and have Kaka. However, while they have invested a lot of money into the club and for all intents and purposes are "big," they are brand new to the league, so there's not really any history. 

As for history, the original teams in the league are Kansas City, Dallas, New York (Red Bulls), Dallas, Colorado, Columbus, DC, Los Angeles, San Jose and New England. LA and DC are the first and second-most successful clubs over MLS's entire history, respectively. LA is considered the league's golden child, having brought David Beckham, Robbie Keane and this summer, Steven Gerrard into the league. They were also home to arguably the best American player of all time in Landon Donovan. 

Seattle, Portland, Vancouver and San Jose trace their lineage back to lower level leagues and leagues from decades past. Seattle is the best-supported team in the league by numbers, drawing the most fans to their stadium each year, and is a very wealthy club despite only being in the league since 2009. Seattle, Portland and Vancouver maintain a regional rivalry where they compete for the Cascadia Cup each year, but the rivalry is fiercest between Portland and Seattle. 

Montreal has long supported soccer, and the Impact have a lower league history as well, but have only been in MLS since 2012. Chicago, while not an MLS original, has been in the league since 1998, but has not been successful in recent years. 

And like any league, there are Brazilian players scattered across different teams. 

Hope this helps! 









 What are you on about? There are tons of Muslims all over Texas.
