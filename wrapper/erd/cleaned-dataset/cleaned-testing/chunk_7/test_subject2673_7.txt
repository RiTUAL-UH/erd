 Heroin least??? Lol bang that shit 




 I'm looking forward to trying 3-fluorophenmetrazine, 2-FA, diclazepam, etizolam, MXE and U47700. 




 I seriously doubt it considering caffiene is not a TAAR1 agonist and does not release any significant amount of dopamine or norepinephrine. 




 Just thought I should add that when methylphenidate is taken with alcohol, not enough ethylphenidate is produced  to result in any significant effects. Any increase in attention or focus would be due to the methylphenidate alone. 




 A Primer of Drug Action by Robert M. Julien. I have some background knowledge in neuroscience and biology and I'm really enjoying this book so far (3 chapters in). 




 "[The neuroprotective effects of methylphenidate] may include 1) direct interactions between methylphenidate and the neuronal dopamine transporter which may attenuate or prevent the entry of methamphetamine into dopaminergic neurons and may also decrease the synthesis of cytoplasmic dopamine through a D2 receptor-mediated signal cascade process"  
  

Does this imply that co-administration of methylphenidate with methamphetamine will decrease the dopaminergic neurotoxicity associated with the latter? If so would it be "safer" to take methylphenidate and methamphetamine at the same time? 




 Alcohol and/or weed my friend. I am under the influence of this combo currently. It can be overwhelming but I find it pleasing overall. 




 This sounds like a great addition! But can someone explain why supertypes will not be removable at runtime, and whether it's a bad idea? 




 Take a different drug that inhibits the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the drug in question. This is a simplification though. 




 Immaculately written. I had to stop at certain points since I was laughing so hard. Now I'm curious to hear the rest. 




 No. I was prescribed Effexor XR for a number of years and smoked weed enough to know that serotonin syndrome does not result from this particular interaction. 




 Thank you for reiterating this point. The top comments in this thread all make excellent points regarding why the White House is incorrect in their analysis, but at the end of the day it boils down to politics. And given the current situation for Democrats, this means walking a fine partisan line to appease the party's usual voters (and corporations/institutions that support the party), especially as midterms draw closer. It seems to me that it's just one of the unfortunate side effects of the influence of money in U.S. politics. 




 Great post! You have me wondering about the LSD and coke combo though. Could you expand a bit on your experience/dosing with that combo? 




 Thousands of hours into Super Smash Bros. Melee. The competitive scene is amazing and I love going to tournaments. 




 "I go 0 to 100 days in jail real quick" 




 This is incorrect. It may be true for some people, but in general it depends on each individual's response, the dosage, and the quality. But moreso on how much you enjoy it. 




 real men drop sheets 




 Great experience report. You mentioned that you've tried Adderall before - do you think 100mg 4-FA is less shaky than, say, 60mg Adderall administered over the same time period? 




 Start with 10-15mg for a sub-breakthrough dose so you can test the waters. To break through you'll need to hold the smoke in your lungs for a while, as well as use a dose more in the range of 30-40mg. This is assuming your friend has N,N-DMT, not 5-MeO-DMT. I would also recommend reading the DMT FAQ in the sidebar and reading a few DMT trip reports on Erowid. Good luck! 




 We makin noise 




 At first I read this as "I was out campaigning for Bush..."  
  
I'm glad I read it wrong. 




 Very well said. I think your writing style emphasizes the irony of your username.  
Anyway, I tend to think of people like McKenna as folks that inspire others to think in very unique ways, regardless of the scientific accuracy of their claims. He seems to embody the fact that taking psychedelics is much more than just a selfish, hedonistic pursuit. 




 100mg is too much. Start with 30mg. 




 If I take a break for a few days then take a bong rip every 15 minutes or so, I tend to get there within a few hits. Just don't forget to repack the bowl! 




 A friend of mine who does light shows (gloving) gave me a light show to the song Do the Astral Plane by Flying Lotus. At the time I was tripping pretty hard on shrooms. I was completely detached from my surroundings for most of the song. It was an extremely intense and immersive experience. I would definitely recommend FlyLo and light shows in general to anyone who's tripping. 




 Wow this is really surprising coming from the same guy who was handcuffed while tripping on 300ug LSD! Great story by the way. I'm not religious but I wish you the best with your career choice. 




 I don't understand the appeal of these new languages that mix paradigms such as functional and imperative programming. It seems to me that the popularization of languages such as Swift will inevitably lead to code that incorporates both paradigms within the same program, which can be confusing.  
  
With that said however, it looks to be a big improvement over Objective-C considering the supposed speed and new set of features. 




 haha how did that interview go?
