 Just to play devil's advocate . . . it could just be an editing oversight, a plotting mistake in a long and complicated book that no one ever caught.

To demonstrate that this is at least possible, in high school we were assigned to read a book, in preparation for a visit of the author to our school.  Everyone in my class was upset about the death of a pet in the book; we spent at least half a class period discussing what the author might have meant by it.  Unlike most of these speculative discussions, we were able to "settle" this one by asking the author himself why he made that choice.  He laughed and said it was because he forgot that the pet was in the hazardous situation that causes its death in the book, and when he noticed during later edits, he decided to go with it instead of bothering to change it. 




 Oh sorry, I totally agree with that objection.  I just thought maybe it was a misunderstanding of the actual research. 




 I guess I'm asking more about how the quality of the original DNA compares with other DNA from ancient sources, and how much that might impact the quality/accuracy of the genome sequence that we have.  Are there potential biases in the sequence that would make phylogenetic comparisons more difficult? 




 How do the challenges of working with mammoth DNA compare with the challenges of other sources of ancient DNA (from either a technical or informatics perspective?) 




 If you think this research is neat, please go ask this guy some questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3coa1l/animals_can_coordinate_neural_activity_to_perform/csxwvj8

Edit: Link to comment from a former member of the lab that did this work. 




 Part of the issue is that it's not necessarily the same link, but very obviously the same research/original primary article.  Plus with a research story this unusual, common sense suggests there's no way it didn't already get posted 24 hours after it was published.

I know that fake internet points aren't the point of /r/science and maybe that's an argument why this shouldn't frustrate me.  But it's also an argument why people should do a better job of searching for prior posts before they post.  If the discussion of a research article is scattered across 5-10 different posts, it's probably going to be less awesome than if it were all on the same post.  By chance, a researcher who had worked in the lab this research came from commented on my original post.  I think that's really neat and I wish more people were asking him/her questions. 




 This research has been posted 6 times in the last 24 hours. 




 Frank McCourt, who wrote *Angela's Ashes*?  As far as I know, he was unknown before he wrote and published that. 




 *The Dog Who Wouldn't Be* by Farley Mowat:

 Thanks for pointing this out, this was a huge oversight in the headline writing.  The researchers in this study showed that the most commonly used antidepressant, along with several others, were not associated with increased risk of birth defects in their study. 




 Original paper: http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11869
"Building an organic computing device with multiple interconnected brains"

Edit to add a cool quote from the paper: "Our central goal was to investigate how well [different ways of linking brain electrode inputs and outputs between four rats] could be employed by the four rats to collaborate in order to solve a particular computational task. [They tested] discrete classification, sequential and parallel computations, and memory storage/retrieval. As predicted, we observed that Brainets [the four rats linked together] consistently outperformed individual rats in each of these tasks." 









 I think Dirk Gently is fantastic, and I've never heard of Last Chance to See!  I'm excited to go find it now. 




 Echolocation was not the ancestral state.  Bats became nocturnal before they evolved echolocation.  There are many ways that evolution could work; to discover and prove how it did work in a particular situation takes more than guessing.

Edited for my shameful spelling.
