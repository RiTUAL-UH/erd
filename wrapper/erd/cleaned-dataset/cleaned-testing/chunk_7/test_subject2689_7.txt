 No, but that is brilliant. You are a smart cookie indeed! 




 Congrats NoSleep! :D!

I wonder, does /u/corgies_26 count as one subscriber, or 26? 




 I -wish- I could upvote this twice. 




 Well, that is spooky. I'm glad I didn't watch that last night before going to bed. Great find, Dalphin! 




 There's also a rumor that you can rent /u/mikerowphone for a day and have him follow you around, reading all the stories for you. It's hands-free, image-free, distraction-free NoSleep browsing---for the low, low cost of "like, just a couple human souls." 




 You forgot to include "teddy bear" in the list. 




 My sister is terrified of ants. Now, I know why. 




 I will wear Rodriguez 24/7 for one week and THEN unleash him. 




 Let us unleash the dogs of war.

HARRRRRR! 




 Kahahaha! 




 We are indeed. You don't have to, because you are a collective, so 'we' applies in your case. 




 Never had a survivor before.

Daaaaamn. 




 You have our gratitude, man-shaped tortilla. The NoSleep eBook pleases us greatly. 




 Your screename made me smile. 




 My dog psychically conveyed to me the story of what happened with his previous owner.

That works, right? Riiiight? :D

 That is super cool. Thanks for sharing! 




 If I see anything that starts with "I'm not a writer, but" or "I've never written anything before, but", I will immediately close it and make an offering to the elder gods to handle the situation. The elder gods then riddle the story with a *ton* of spelling/grammatical errors, making even fewer people want to read it.


(Psst, you can't call out specific stories here in the OOC, so I recommend you edit out that title you used as an example.) 




 Her name is Julie, and she has never been to Arizona. We don't really look alike, though, so I guess that didn't really make sense anyways. Oh well, you dated my she-doppleganger. HA HA HA! 




 Didn't you date a Canadian at some point? Could have been my sister. 




 That cat knows how to put the 'ow' in 'meow'.

...

That was a lame, lame pun, and I feel pawful about it. 




 I LOVE it! You may be surrounded by chickens, but you're the only *chick* I see. ;D 




 It was hard to get all of you to sit still long enough to get the group portrait done. Fortunately, I had plenty of doggy treats in my pocket. :D 




 My moose and bear were sleeping. I didn't want to bother them. 




 YOUR VOICE. I WANT TO BOTTLE IT AND LISTEN TO IT BEFORE I GO TO BED, YOU GLORIOUS AUSSIE, YOU! 




 Very well said, Xylo. 




  It's not just the cool kids. They let Manen and me hang out in IRC too.

 Beautiful!
But where's the army of chickens? 




 You're about 0.50% not a human with horse limbs. Or a horse with human limbs. Or a horse with no name. In the desert. 




 Don't worry: I only use my powers for the betterment of mankind? 




 You look classy as heck, Ayme! 




 I want those sunglasses. They -and you- are so cool. 




 Yes. Yes it is. :D 




 Who are you, the Canadianism police?

There's CLEARLY a gleam of hockey in my eye.

 P.S. - /u/test_subject2689 is exempt from this, because we all know he is a sexy beast.

You know me so well. ;D
 




 I thought it was fantastic. Great pacing, lovely voice, etc.

One thing that's missing is the obligatory line at the beginning about how absolutely sexy the author is. Every good narration starts with that. :) 




 Sweet, thanks Blankekeke! 




 From a completely objective point of view, season 5 episode 2 was brilliant.

What's that? N-no. Not ... not because I have two stories featured in that one. Nope. Shhhhh. Being perfectly objective. Yup. TOTALLY OBJECTIVE FOR REALZ.

I'd say all the episodes are stellar and definitely worth getting season passes. What makes it so hard to pick one episode over the other is that the types of stories told varies greatly, so if there's one story that's not quite your cup of tea, the next could still send you into a frantic fear-spiral of doom. It's great!

 Fear of heights is in there twice.

Unless it's secretly fear of repetition?! AAAH! 




 I should have known when the squad car pulled into the run-down police station that something wasn't quite right. The building looked old and abandoned. The police insignia lay crooked in a bed of tall grass, the letters 'PO' were missing from the display above the main doors, leaving only 'LICE' in their wake, and graffiti littered the outer walls. If not for the two other vehicles at the very back of the lot, I would have thought we'd pulled into the wrong place. The squad cars were in as pitiful a shape as the station. Their emblem and motto  To Serve and Protect  were faded with age and coated in dirt, their tires were deflated, and one of their tail lights had shattered. Yeah, warning bells definitely should have gone off in my head, but if you cant trust the police, who can you trust? I attributed the buildings poor condition to budget cuts. Since they could not go on strike, officers frequently and openly protested the citys cheap financial support by wearing mismatched socks and all sorts of inappropriate pants, ranging from army print to clown stripes.

Two officers escorted me inside. If the main lobby was any indication, then the interior was as poorly-maintained as the exterior. I waited by the reception desk on an old schoolhouse chair. Its green and cracked back did not match the colors of the other two next to it. While the officers traded a few words with the woman behind the desk, I couldn't help but notice how very much alike they were. It wasn't just the uniform, either. The three were the same height, had the same hair color and style, carried themselves in the same posture, and shared the same build.

"Excuse me," I interrupted, walking over to the trio.

One of the officers who'd brought me in turned towards me, "What?" he asked.

I motioned to a chipped mug full of pens, "Can I have one?"

"Yeah, sure," he replied, his tone barely registering emotion.

I pocketed the pen happily, and took a seat once more. If I was going to be stuck here all evening, at least I'd get a souvenir. The three continued to talk while I waited in the humid lobby. Couldn't they at least open a window to get a breeze rolling? The air was so thick and tasted so bitter that I could barely breathe.

Once the officers sorted everything out, they lead me down a dirty corridor. Dried leafs littered the ground, crunching under my feet as I walked. Surely, they could find room in their budget for a janitor? As we moved through the station, I began to notice more and more issues: missing doors, broken windows, and even a hole in the roof. Frankly, I half-expected to see a family of raccoons scurrying about. There also seemed to be a surprisingly small roster of officers on duty in the station. We seemed to pass the same two guys almost everywhere we went.

"In here," said one of the uniformed men, motioning to a set of doors, "well come get you when it's time."

I nodded and stepped through the double doors. The smell on the other side was even worse than in the lobby. It was a mix of sweat and the unique odor of slightly-burnt skin after a few hours under the sun. Unsurprisingly, the room was full of men with very similar features to my own. Aside from one old man in the corner, we also looked about the same age.

"Guess we're all here for the line-up, huh?" I asked, in an attempt to break the ice.

The others averted their gazes. The situation wasn't ideal, but I saw no reason to be sour about it. It was our civic duty, and being grumpy wouldn't change a thing. We'd all been cherry-picked to act as distractors in a police line-up. I hadn't been particularly thrilled when the police officers stopped me on my way home from work telling me I matched the description of a violent mugger, but I calmed down once they reassured me that I was not the suspect, merely a decoy. I was missing the season finale of my favorite show for this, but at least I was doing something useful for society.

The old man's head rose slowly, "Son, you won't be leaving any time soon," he warned.

When I saw his face, I nearly gasped. He was old, yes, but his facial features were remarkably similar to my own. We had the same green eyes, curved nose, and similar cheek bones. If we were to walk around town together, people would surely assume he was my dad.

"Oh, that's okay. I'm not in a rush," I answered cheerfully.

My gaze shifted from the old man to the others in the room. We all shared a remarkable likeness. Whoever the victim was, he'd have a hell of a hard time identifying the attacker. No one stood out. Even I would have trouble telling us apart. I thought the others would be as amused as I was, but they all kept to themselves. Unable to find a conversational partner, I took a seat so I could wait for the officer to return. The silence started making me nervous, as though everyone knew a secret I wasn't privy to. Every now and again, I caught them glancing at me from the corner of their eyes. It was unnerving.

Silence  it was so quiet that I could hear the hum of neon lights all the way down the hall. They played in peculiar unison, like instruments in a Bethovian orchestra.

The door creaked open. The others cringed and recoiled as an officer stepped inside. I honestly couldn't tell if it was one of the two that had driven me in, or a different officer altogether. It was only when I saw him next to the other men in the room that I realized something: he, too, could pass as one of us. The eyes, the cheekbones --- he looked like me. Like *us*. My skin crawled at the eerie realization that everyone I had seen in the past hour or so looked just like me. How had I not noticed sooner? I tried to shake the unsettling feeling away with a forced shiver, but I was only half-successful.

The officer lifted a hand, his index finger pointing to six of us, "You. You there. You two  you, and you, by the wall," he commanded.

I got up and walked over, while the other five gasped and groaned. They reluctantly approached. Though I did not understand their gloomy reactions, part of me felt the same way. Still, the quicker we went through the line-up, the quicker we'd get to go home. I, for one, was glad I'd been chosen to be part of group 1.

The officer handed out numbered boards. My board, #5, looked ancient. Its corners were rounded with wear, coffee stains coated the surface, and yellowing tape kept portions of it in place. The others took their boards with as much enthusiasm as a kid handed a plateful of steamed broccoli. I'd never seen grown men quite manage the childlike look of disgust and accompanying pout until that day.

Once we received our numbers, we were brought to a suffocatingly narrow room with doors on both ends. I could hear the door locking behind us, which made me wonder if the mugger was in the room with me. Fortunately, I was at a police station. If there was one place a violent mugger wouldn't try anything stupid, it'd be in the middle of a police station. The back wall was decorated in faded height lines like those seen in mug shots. They made me realize that, strangely enough, we were *all* the exact same height, right down to the half-inch. In front of us was a large glass pane through which we could see a pair of identical-looking police officers sitting on stools, watching us. *That's odd*, I remember thinking, *Don't they usually use double-sided mirrors?*

"Not me  not me  not me " murmured #3, his voice quivering with fear.

He wasn't the only one acting strangely. #1 and #4 were huddled in the corner, facing away from the window. #2 and #6 were fidgeting and whispering beneath their breaths. *Grow up*, I thought. Why were they all so nervous? Was I missing something obvious? Could we get in trouble if we were mistakenly identified?

The victim walked into the room on the other side of the glass. Even though he held his head low, I couldn't help but notice the similarities. He had my build and my haircut, though *his* body was covered in bruises and blood. I felt a chill run down the back of my neck, filling me with the same anxious dread as my fellow distractors. A feeling in my gut urged me to run away, yet I found myself paralysed with unexplainable fear. This was silly. There was no reason to be afraid, or so I hoped. My nervousness increased with every step the victim took. He looked pretty banged up. There was no reason to think he hadn't been attacked by a mugger, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something else was going on.

The victim's head turned upwards.

"Oh, god " I whispered.

I was looking at myself. He wasn't just a crude look-alike like the others. No, he was definitely *me*. Even through the swollen lip and black eye, I recognized every square inch of my face: the placement of my freckles, my childhood scar along my hairline, my right eye, which was slightly smaller than the left. He had them all. I didn't have time to fully take in the phenomena before the doppelgnger lifted his arm, an accusatory finger outstretched. I knew before he even did it. I knew he was going to point to me. I knew, yet it didn't, spare me the shock when he did it. It felt like being smacked in the face by a stray baseball. He pointed straight at me, an electrifying feeling surging through my body as he did so. If that wasn't bad enough, the others in the line-up suddenly calmed down. They looked like they'd just dodged a bullet, which sent me into a panic.

When I saw the police officers rise from their seats while looking at me, I knew I had to run. I bolted to the emergency exit. The door was locked. I could hear the sound of a key jingling in the door on the other side of the room. There was no doubt in my mind that the officers were coming for me. With a fair dose of adrenaline fuelling my actions, I grabbed a fire extinguisher and smashed it against the doorknob. It took three tries to get it, but it finally broke off, allowing the door to swing open just as the cops came in from the other end. I could vaguely hear them shouting, though I could not make out a word of what they were saying over the combined sounds of my heartbeat and blood gushing to my head. I ran as fast as my feet allowed, feeling myself drowning in unexplainable fear.

Lost  I was lost. Lost in the building, lost in fear, lost in desperate and unshakable panic. An alarm went off, practically paralysing me with its piercing shriek. More than ever, I wanted to escape the endless maze of run-down hallways and broken light fixtures. I could barely hear the officers' footsteps over the mechanical warning call, but my senses were just sharp enough that I could safely evade them.

I ran for what felt like hours, but could have been minutes. I ran until my chest burned with exhaustion and my muscles cramped. I ran until I came across the waiting room from where I'd been in earlier. Hoping to warn the others, I stepped inside.

The room was empty, but for the old man in the back.

"Hey!" I shouted, "We've got to get out of here!"

He didn't answer.

I walked closer, and noticed something on his head. My scar. *That's impossible * I thought, gasping in shock. I placed a hand on his shoulder to try and shake him, but he'd gone cold. His skin had become dry and pruny, like a tomato left out in the sun for too long. I recoiled in terror, a loud scream escaping my lips. Suddenly, I felt a pair of fingers digging into my shoulder with the strength of a crocodile's jaw. Again, I shouted, desperately swatting at the captor's hand. By twisting my shoulder uncomfortably, I managed to break free of the vice-like grip and turn around, only to be confronted with my bruised doppelgnger. A look of bitter contempt had found a permanent home on his face. I never realized how unsettling that look was when I gave it to others. My lookalike deliberately blocked the exit, ensuring that escape would not be easy. When he made a move towards me, I acted on instinct and felt my arm flying towards his face. The sound of broken glass erupted from him as my fist connected with his already damaged eye.

Pain. Sharp, blinding pain 

I stumbled to the side, holding my throbbing right eye. It thumped and prickled with a thousand needles. My vision became blurry, but not blurry enough to keep me from seeing the other "me" run towards me. I had to defend myself. I punched, elbowed, and jabbed at him. Few of my blows actually connected  I'm not exactly a martial arts expert  but the ones that did sent pain flooding into me. My frantic blitz came to an end when I went for his stomach. The pressure nearly took my breath away. There was no beating him: I had to run. I shoved him aside, fully expecting him to try and grab me. To my surprise, he fell to the floor and didn't try to get up. Had I hurt him more than I thought?

My relief was short-lived. As soon as I stepped back out into the hallway, I ran into a pair of officers. Their expressions were strangely blank. An thought came to mind when I realized that I was covered in bruises. What if they thought I was the "victim"?

"He's in there," I said, mustering up every bit of calm that I could manage.

The officers, without hesitating, ran into the waiting area. I didn't know how long my ruse would work, so I took off towards the entrance. When I reached the lobby, the receptionist from earlier stood up and turned to me. I only looked at her for a moment, but my eyes caught sight of my scar on her head. *What the hell.* There was no time to think or try to understand. She started chasing after me, so I ran out the doors as fast as I could.

The air outside smelled so fresh, devoid of the stagnant after-taste in the police station. It was dark out, and I remember feeling hopeful that I could blend into the night and escape. I heard stomping footsteps behind me, saw beams of light pointed at me, and could hear sirens blaring in the distance. I recall running, but I confess, I don't remember how I got home. I have no recollection of reaching my apartment complex, unlocking my door, or getting in bed.

But I must have.

I woke up this morning safe and sound in my bed, albeit quite sore. When I got up to brush my teeth, my reflection sent a shiver down my spine. My face was bruised and swollen. The wounds were identical to the ones I saw on the victim at the police station. The busted lip, the black eye, and the cut on his cheek  they were all the same. My heart raced wildly, blurry after-images dancing in my head. Running. Police officers. My face. My face *everywhere*. As I leaned back, I felt something in my pocket. I reached for it and retrieved the pen Id taken from the police station, inspecting it closely. The city police motto was written on it, though half of it was scratched out. It read:

"To serve" 




 Congrats! :)

 Manen never says no to narrations. :O Because Manen loves to hear his stories read by other people (as long as they are credited). Manen talks in the third person sometimes, but he's a very normal person, he assures you! 




 Lovely idea! 




 My coworker made me try [Blindscape](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gavinbrown.blindscape hl=en), which is a somewhat interactive app/story. It's really well made (considering all you see is a black screen). It's like listening to a NoSleep story. Pretty cool. 




 Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it. You're quite right: the story would be much more chilling if it dealt with psychiatric issues rather than supernatural ones. (Though one could argue that the werewolf is a metaphor for her psychiatric issues. Hahaha, ok, no. I definitely meant it as a werewolf.) 




 Howdy,

I can't identify which episode it is, but I can tell you that it's not in seasons 1 through 3, as I recently listened to them and that story doesn't ring a bell. Hopefully that narrows things down for you. 




 No. xD

To put it diplomatically  the NoSleep Interviewer decided to quit NoSleep as a whole. 




 Y'know how your mom always used to tell you not to stare into the sun for too long? Well, someone found out why. 




 That's OK. I was a little shy when I first started coming here. Rest assured, we're happy to help. (Or grumpy but still willing to help!) 




 As team leader, I am contractually obligated to be positive in public. As a result, my comments about the story are as follows:

* It was a story.
* It had words.
* Sometimes, those words formed sentences.

GO TEAM! 




 Good job Grumpy Murder Sharks!

Good job Steve from Corporate, who just kept staring at us quietly the whole time. It was very  uh  motivating? 




 Well, I love you right back--- in a totally creepy way. ;D 




 Totally not a judgement, xandra, but instead of asking whether we wondered the same thing, why not flat-out ask where the ideas came from? A lot of the NoSleep authors visit the OOC and are more than happy to answer questions. Mind you, we're a comical bunch, so we might just tell ya our oven mits talk to us at night and give us our ideas, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Hypothetically, if you ask, I'd tell you that my ideas just come into existence out of the blue. Sometimes, I see an object and a story weaves itself from there, sometimes I'm taking a shower and the voices in my head write a story. It all depends. 




 Are they for hire? I can pay in candy. 




 It wouldn't be Reddit's responsibility to enforce an author's copyright. Stories posted here are the property of their respective authors. Hypothetically, if someone wanted to make a movie adaptation, then they need to ask for permission and option out the story (usually at a certain price). 




 It's simple really [...]

It looks like some kind of formula to generate a wormhole or something. It makes my brain bleed.

But then again, I never did have any aptitude for the maths. (Or should I say mathstitude?)
