 I think it also depends on the size of your gaming group. If your gaming group is expanding and you find that sometimes 2 tables are playing at the same time, then I think it's very reasonable to purchase more games. 




 To give another perspective, you should also think about whether **your gaming group** is ready for Terra Mystica. You/your group seem to be mostly into interactive and thematic games but TM, whilst being an excellent strategy game (and my personal favourite), brings a different vibe to the table. As my friend once said, if he sees my game of TM with silent players hands folded, staring at the board intensely, he knows that we're having some serious fun.

Mage knight is really good as a solo game anyways so if you enjoy character progression and action point optimisation, and don't mind reading rules I'd suggest buying it. 




 There's a whole range of boardgames that could be played solo  available:

Also, technically all fully cooperative games (e.g. **Pandemic**) can be played solo. You just have to take up the role of more than 1 player yourself.
 




 What are specific details that made you appreciate the attention to details that board game designers have put in a game? It may be something subtle in the rule book, designs on the board, player aids etc.

For me, I have found the following useful:

1. Easy reference sheet on the back of the rule book (instead of credits!) to explain various icons so that you don't have waste time flipping through the book.

2. If money is open information and is used frequently, use a resource track on the board to indicate how much each player has. Also makes the game less fiddly.

3. Different icons in addition to player colours for the colour blind players. 




 Looks like you enjoy Euros so obligatory: **Power Grid**, **Keyflower**, **Eclipse** and **Lords of Waterdeep w/ expansion**.
 




 The rules are on BGG already, and Rahdo plays through the game in his video. 

I do agree with your point on stretch goals. 




 Have you tried the mini-expansion? It adds a few interesting element with the new engineers and bonus tiles. As there is a public pool of really strong bonus tiles there's more of an incentive to rush to get it. 




 Pretty solid month for me, listing from my least to most favourite:

**Machi Koro The Harbour Expansion** - Dragged the base game much longer, and in truth everyone is just waiting to buy the tuna boat.

**Ghost Stories** - Too relentless as a co-op, not much feeling of reward/satisfaction when you kill ghosts as more of them just keep on coming. 

**X-COM** - Pretty neat asymmetric roles in a real time co-op. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of co-ops though..

**Xia - Legends of a Drift System** - A 4 hour game (with 5p) that depended on dice rolling....I did win by shipping goods (with Lone Drifter and Manchester it's really easy). It's fun if you like a lot of chaos and random outcomes I guess.

**Kemet** - The design is very solid and the tech tree is pretty interesting. A bit too vicious for me.

**Chicago Express** - Fast paced economic game with bidding mechanism. No variability in setup though.

*Summoner Wars** - Quick head-to-head battling card game. Getting to exploit your own faction's strengths is pretty fun.

**The Ancient World** - A nice little mix of mechanics but nothing really groundbreaking in this game. A decent gateway worker placement.

**Belfort** - Area control game with worker placement mechanics. It seemed harmless but the play style of each game is different due to the special buildings that comes out. I love worker placement with variable powers of workers so this fits the bill.

**Captains of Industry** - A (mostly) closed economy game where players produce, buy and sell resources to each other. Lovely interactions with a great simulation to micro-economics. Would definitely replay.

**CO2** - Very intricate Euro but once you get pass learning the rules it's very fun to build combos and getting what you exactly need in a round. I love games where there seem to be very limited actions (15 turns per player in a 4p game) but there are actually a lot of decision making required. Players also need to pay a lot of attention to what other people are planning and capable to do on their turn. 




 **Scoville** - a new game about planting and harvesting peppers. If you stand between two fields of red pepper and blue pepper...you harvest a purple pepper. You get points for planting peppers on the fields and spending peppers you own on recipes/quests.  




 In 4-5 player games, players need to make much tougher decisions:

1. Initial placements: obviously you will have to think harder when more players are present on the board. 

2. Map is much tighter: Triple terra-forms, upgrading to 3-shipping, using priests as workers...you seldom see this happening in a 2p game but be prepared to do so once you get blocked in a 5p game.

3. Power generation is much quicker, but the good power actions are easily taken in the first action of any given round.

4. Cult tracks are much tighter - in a 2p game if you've fallen behind on a track you just don't bother moving up. Same for largest network.

5. Favour tiles and Town tiles. There are 3 of each in the level 1-2 favour tiles, and 2 of each for town tiles (in the base game). This means you could pretty much guarantee to get what you want in a 2p game. Definitely not happening in a 5p game.

6. Variability. It's just maths. The combination of factions present on the board becomes much more varied with a 4-5p game. You'll need to keep an eye on more player's special abilities. 




 Yup! I learned Caverna before I played Agricola so on my first play through I felt constrained and under accomplished.

Then I played Caverna about 10 more times and eventually got bored as there is practically no random setup. You don't need to plan that much ahead as there are way too many alternatives. I've switched back to Agricola and find it much more satisfying when a plan works out! 




 **Shadowrun: Crossfire** or **Legendary deck building games** to a Harry Potter theme. 




 Have played **Pictomania**. It's one of my favourite party games! The rules are very simple, basically there is a common board of topics on display and you are randomly assigned one of it to draw, but you have to guess other people's drawings quickly at the same time.

There's a variety of difficulty that players can choose, from easy ones like submarine, goat, gardener, to abstract ones like who, bored, insurance. 




 **Nippon** - from the designers of Panamax. Probably out in Essen?

**The Gallerist** - from the designer of Kanban. Should be on kickstarter soon.

**La Granja** - waiting for a reprint in the summer! 




 **The Resistance: Avalon**, **Game of Thrones (2nd ed)**, **BSG**, **Cosmic Encounter**, 

Betrayal and backstabbing are just not within my definition of fun. 




 Not boring, but standard as in getting duplicate ingredients, testing twice, publish a theory. Sure the artifacts mix things up a bit, but you can't really plan too much ahead as it will depend on the test results. 




 Alchemists is a good game, but I don't think it is that replayable. Once everyone knows the procedure of crossing out boxes, the first two rounds become fairly standard.
