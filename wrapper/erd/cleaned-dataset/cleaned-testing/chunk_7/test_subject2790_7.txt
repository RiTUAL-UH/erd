 All cats were female and all dogs were male.  




 "Vanity Fair enough to be had on the consequences of convictions for football players and the make up artist did my trial based on my natural skin care products and services try the box below and we will be in the UK but I can try explain an issue here to view the locations of the posts prior to last night and had been okay with it I'll do it for a while to get the best way."

Apparently my phone creates essays. 




 I've had good and bad experiences with zero hours. A club I used to work at would let us pick our shifts a week in advance, the only caveat being that we had to work a Saturday night.

The pub I'm currently working in also operates zero hours and it can be hit or miss. Last week I earned over 200 for working 30hrs, next week I'm only working 17hrs so I'm looking at just under half that. It can be a struggle to budget, especially as I don't get student funding over summer.

Ideally zero hours shouldn't exist, but I can see why these contracts appeal to certain industries. 




 Not had it with pineapple but I can heartily recommend cheese and apple toast. That stuff is amazing. 




 Thanks! :) Sometimes it's really cathartic to actually get the words out of me rather than internalising my feelings. 




 With it being Father's Day yesterday and after reading the [following post](https://m.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ao0qv/serious_fathers_who_abandoned_your_family_whyd/) on AskReddit and the stories of fathers fighting desperately to see their estranged children it made me think about my own relationship with my father. I realised that even though we've not spoken in over 18 months and will probably never have a normal relationship that there were questions that I still carry to this day.

Why did you drag my brother and sister into your leaving and make such a production of it? (He had them help carry his things into his mistress' car and left them with a letter to give to our mum)

Why did you make no effort to keep in contact with us, besides a passive aggressive status on MSN messenger?

Why, when I eventually reached out at age 18, did you have our entire relationship revolve around money? (He helped me out financially in my first year of university but after that would always bring up how much I would owe him when I graduated)

Why, despite hearing from EMum how sorry you are for hurting us all, is the only apology we've ever had a CD telling us to forgive you or 'get the fuck over it'? 

Thank you RBN for giving me the opportunity to work through my lingering issues and FLEAS and to my wonderful fianc and future in laws for giving me the love and support I so desperately needed.

Sorry that this post didn't really have a point but it was stuff I needed to say.
