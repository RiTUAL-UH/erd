 The crust is a prepared dough from Pillsbury. 

The sauce:

5 dried pasilla or ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded

Two 6-inch corn tortillas, or handful regular tortilla chips

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 1/2 medium onions, chopped

Kosher salt

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 3/4 cups chicken stock

One 3.1-ounce disk Mexican chocolate, chopped, such as Ibarra or Abuelita 

Freshly ground black pepper

Other ingredients:

1 1/2 cups cooked chicken. I prefer chicken legs

Cilantro

Queso fresco

Crema fresca

Sesame seeds (optional)

To make the sauce, blend all sauce ingredients until smooth consistency. 

Precook the dough for a crispier texture and better mouth feel. Otherwise you will get raw dough. Top with sauce and chicken and bake until dough is fully cooked. After it's done, top with queso, cilantro, crema fresca, and sesame seeds.  









 Or by handling it, then eating something else without washing my hands? 









 Spicy honey. Perfect for chicken strips or shrimp Tacos

* 2 tablespoons vanilla extract

For cake:

* Betty crocker or your favorite brand of Fudge Chocolate or Dark Chocolate cake mix.

Preheat oven to 350F and spray the cake pan with the baking spray. Add cajeta to bottom of bundt pan so it settles before adding cake mix and set aside.

To make the flan add evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla to the blender and add condensed milk last because it is so thick. Blend until well mixed. 

Pour chocolate cake mix into pan. Pour flan mixture over chocolate cake mix **slowly**. It will settle as it cooks.
