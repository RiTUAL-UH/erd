 Try me bitch 




 First Bono, now this guy...

The rock gods have been smiling down on us 




 Well, that's pretty shitty! 




 Hello Elon, huge fan! I actually just bought some additional Tesla stock yesterday because I love the direction you are taking your company. I have two questions for you:

1. What do you think the auto industry will look like in 10 years?

2. Will Tesla foray into the driverless automobile sector at some point in the future?

Thanks in advance and good luck tomorrow! 




 Are you considering a SpaceX IPO? 




 Sometimes we are thinking about something depraved or innapropriate to repeat, so we just say we are thinking about nothing. But mostly, it's nothing.  




 Smoke weed everyday 




 Give me! 




 Asian's...amirite? 




 Go back and get him. You won't regret it! 




 You're welcome for all the freedom. 




 There are some seriously moving tributes by fellow broadcasters on ESPN today. Total waterworks in Bristol. RIP Stuart Scott. 




 He's a NFL Insider with CBS. Definitely credible. 




 Mmmm hmmm

 What does she look like? 




 Death by fruit salad. Bring it on! 




 Rekt 




 Must be Goldilocks! 




 Kershaw had the distinct pleasure of watching Madison's postseason heroics from his couch. 




 Was it even a question? 




 I wouldn't be married to the best woman I know. 




 Ummm Reddit... 




 Mike Holmgren would be an amazing hire.  




 Classic Harbaugh 




 It, I'm deathly afraid of clowns because of that movie 




 Clowns 




 There is a god 




 Sonic boom! 




 Very diplomatic buddy 




 Bold move 




 You sir, are an asshole. That is no joking matter! 




 If I was Woody Harrelson from True Detective and his sidepiece took her top off. Booooingggg 




 Literally the most frustrating thing on the planet... 




 People who just stop in the middle of a walkway, with no regard for anyone around them. I want to slap these people upside the head. 




 Trying to figure out women 




 It's so dusty in here... 




 Merry Christmas and tropical vibes to all!!! 




 My brother, who lives across the country, got my grandma a printer/scanner/copier/fax machine a few years ago. Everyone thought it was so nice of him to get my grandma something that she could use to stay active and keep building her art business. Guess who gets a call everytime it isn't working properly? He knew, he definitely knew! 




 Max Cady from Cape Fear. 




 It won an Oscar...for best movie ever. 




 Look at the funbags on that hosehound! 




 We did the same thing for our Save the Date. Awesome concept and adorable Berner! 




 Well this really escalated quickly...

 Couldn't agree more with this analysis. I honestly think that the players love playing for Harbaugh, but at this point they know they are playing for a coach that is going to be forced out after this season and it is completely toxic. Jed York and Baalke are going to run this ship into the ground and it's so sad to watch. I feel the worst for Frank Gore. That poor, poor man. He deserves better than this! 




 What were the ramifications of getting busted telling your tall tale? I know you have some funny/crazy stories...
