 Bacon, garlic powder, and sriracha in split pea is my ultimate lazy meal. 




 Just looked at the website for the annual persimmon festival that occurs about an hour south of me, but the recipes were all for persimmon pudding or praline.

I've had some amazing persimmon breads and cakes, as well as jelly type things, pies, crumbles, and even had them on top of pancakes. But I've never had them in anything savory, although I think it could be done well.

The Mitchell, IN, Persimmon Festival is a wonderful thing. 




 That sounds amazing! Risotto is my go-to dish that seems fancy. Bacon, mushrooms, kale/chard, and parmesan is my personal favorite. 




 Glad my French isn't too rusty to understand that. Granted, this the first semester in 7 years that I haven't taken a French class. 




 What a beautiful memorial. So so so sorry for your loss, but now you will always have her. I think if my (not twin) sister passed before me, I would do the same. 




 Now that I know what's in the animal sauce, I'm ok with the fact that I've never been to In n Out, and probably never will. 




 Yeah, this is why I'm afraid of growing hebrs in my apartment. There isn't a single wind that they don't like to sit in. 




 States here, I've only had "Irish" stew from a local place whose famous appetizer is literally deep fried balls of cheddar mashed potatoes, but the stew there is good. Btown is known for ethnic food, but I bet most of it is still far from authentic. 




 Oh sewing injuries. This one didn't happen to me, but my mom. She wasn't paying enough attention using the machine and bam! Needle all the way through her thumb. That was a fun ER trip. 




 I'm drinking myself to death. I'm only 22. I know I have a problem. I go through two handles a week. I miss a lot of class because I'm passed out by the time I need to leave. 

But I'm terrified of quitting. My family says I seem much happier, and I feel happier because I'm drunk. All the time. I have the worst dreams when I go to bed sober. Memories of the man who emotionally abused me and images of him with my former best friend creep up unless I drink them away. I don't start crying for no reason when everything seems funny.

I don't want to stop because I don't like who I am when I'm sober. But I know that this is eventually going to kill me. Whether it be physically or due to the fact that missing so much class will kill my dreams, it will kill me. 




 Like others have said, raspberries, but also a really good, dry red wine. Maybe some pistachios. 




 Hate to hijack a thread, but is there any way to do this with an electric range? It's all I've ever known, amd my current apartment has one. 




 Yup. Pound of sugar, pound of flour, pound of eggs, pound of butter, pound of something else, from my memory. Why they're called pound cakes. 




 It's a sign of psychopathy. But a mental disorder still doesn't excuse it, in my mind. Like, I have been diagnosed with more than one mental disorder, but hurting innocent creatures like this is despicable. 




 Roast beef and melted swiss with spinach, mushrooms, carrots, and green bell pepper on toasted rye with honey and red pepper flakes. A side of proper mac and cheese, the kind that is baked with gruyere, asiago, and parmesan. 




 I always order it "warmed through," or "as rare as is legal.' 




 So, my father has made what we call Lamb-o Bucco for years. It is my favorite dish ever.

However, my father has recently gotten sober, so having any alcohol in the house just won't happen. When he made it this past weekend, he used a mix of cider vinegar and grape juice concentrate. It was good, but nothing like how it used to be.

I don't want to trigger him by suggesting buying those tiny bottles of wine, since he would only need one, but they come in packs of four, but is there any suggestion y'all could come up with? 

TL;DR: alcoholic father in recovery, how to replace wine in recipes. 




 That definitely happens. I made the unrealistic New year's resolution to make all of May family blankets for Christmas, and realized that I won't be able to do it. But good to hear that yours is coming together! 




 I'm working on my second ripple Afghan (and my third Afghan ever after making nothing but hats and scarves). Once you get in the zone, it will come together. Get some stitch markers, if you need them, put on a movie (I've been rewatching Matilda and Mulan a lot), or some show you like (all of the Star Treks are on Netflix, hint hint nudge nudge), and work for a couple hours a day. If you work on it a bit a day, it can come together in a couple months. 




 Not at all! I'm not really a "girly girl," nor a tomboy, but that color combo seems very neutral.

I'm working on an Afghan for my grandma that is about the same height by now, so good luck! 




 I never used to salt my pasta water, and don't really find much of a difference. 




 My family calls it a one-eyed Egyptian.  All of these other names make way more sense, though. 




 They're fine. As a poor college kid myself, I often buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze it. Sell by usually means use by is at least a week and half later. 




 Haha, that's basically how my tiny high school made beignets in French class. 




 Yes. Cornflake chicken was a favorite of mine growing up, and now I just love non traditional breadings. Flamin hot fried chicken, anyone? 




 Earlier this year I decided to try a spicy strawberry risotto. I've had spicy berry dishes that I loved, but this was so awful. It had sriracha, strawberries, pea shoots, and worst of all, an entire bottle of Gewurstraminer. It was bitter and sweet and spicy all at the same time, and was still somehow fairly bland. Just awful. 




 Same, although I learned the hard way that it's a bad life choice to make a super garlicky dish for someone you intend on making out with. Even though you've both eaten it, it still tastes icky. 




 Ended up only making hats, but I was able to teach a couple people how to make sc scarves, one of them well enough to be able to teach someone else! Sadly, I was only able to stay for 6 hours, because I found out that drinking too many energy drinks is a bad life choice (I've now been up for 18 hours and don't feel tired at all, and Red Bull puke is a thing), but at least I got two and a half hats done!

The knitters got a couple scarves done total, and several people learned new skills! The experienced crocheters/knitters will be finishing projects that were started, so the children will be getting quite a few hats and scarves.

All in all, it was a very successful event. The host was excited to start Project Linus events, even though the nearest chapter is about 45 minutes away. We learned that knit/crochet a thons will probably work better for other times, like noon to midnight, but a lot of fun was had by all.

 My little girl sometimes sleeps with her tail in her mouth. So sweet. 




 That makes sense. I'll look up a pattern or two for mittens, and stick to my hats for the beginners.

I only thought wrist warmers because they're just rectangles stitched into tubes with small holes, which is great for people who may be crocheting for the first time. 




 That's a great idea! I'll look up some patterns.

And yeah, this event is awesome. I always do it with my leftover yarn, anyway, but so far there are 13 people who are gonna be there for at least a few hours. That's a lot of hats/scarves/whatever for those less fortunate! 




 https://www.facebook.com/events/1521030161471079/

This is a great event! We will be meeting to make cold weather gear for kids at the Middle Way House, the local battered women's shelter. It's tomorrow 7pm to 7am, although you don't need to stay the whole time.

If you live off campus, like me, you can still come in through the veranda till midnight. And I bet some of the awesome residents will help you if you may need to go out for a smoke once in a while (again, like me).

There will be yarn, needles, amd hooks provided, along with free snacks. If you don't know how to knit or crochet, there will be people there who can teach you (myself included on the crochet side).

TL;DR: knit-a-thon tomorrow at Collins for a great cause. You can learn a new skill and work for the greater good at the same time! 




 Tomorrow night (7pm to 7am) a group will be meeting on campus to make cold weather gear for the children at our local battered women's shelter. A great cause, but I will be the only crochet expert there, in a slew of knitters (not that I have anything against bistitchuals).

I've come up with an easy, 2 hour children's hat pattern, but is there anything else you'd suggest? Wrist warmers come to mind, which I can also teach newbies in two seconds. 

I'd especially like something to show how big a child's wrists or neck are. I've got a chart about hats, but I hardly ever see kids, so I dont know how big to make these things. 




 I've only recently gotten to where I enjoy cheese, so a mild one is better for people like me. Mozzarella and baby Swiss are my favorites, and I still can only enjoy them melted. So the mildness can be nice for some people.

That said, I hope that I will be able to taste bleu or brie without gagging soon. I'm on my way. 




 Roast beef and swiss on toasted rye. I usually add spinach and mushrooms, and always ALWAYS put a drizzle of honey and some red pepper flakes. 




 My choco chip recipe calls for water. I've been told they're the best cookies ever /brag 




 This. I have one crop top that I pair with a high waisted a line skirt, and only about an inch of my smallest bit shows. That's one of my favorite outfits. 




 My dad's answer to "do you want to pray with us?" is "sure! Let me go get my goat." Haven't been bothered in years. 




 This class sounds awesome. I have a dream of going to pastry school in France. Was the class in French? Do you already live in/near Paris? If not, was it worth the travel, and how did you feel about Parisians? I haven't spent much time there, and both times I went, we spent so much time doing touristy stuff that I got a kinda bad impression. 




 Livers and kidneys are the only things that gross me out, simply because they are organs that filter out toxins.

That said, I have mildly enjoyed foie gras, and cow's brain is one of the most delectable things I've ever had. And I love most things that freak out my friends (escargot and sea cucumber are two of my favorite foods). 




 ....I, I want to be a steak fairy. 




 Going in on it with several other people seems worth it. Personally, I won't do it, just because I remember the horror story that happened after my sister bought one with her boyfriend at the time. It came in about a week before Thanksgiving, when she flew back home. In that time, her freezer died, which meant she came home to two week old beef and its smell permeating a studio apartment. 




 I've had people actively thank me for looking away from my phone when crossing the street or walking through a parking lot. Like, really? It's so rare that you need to thank someone who isn't a moron? 




 Mini toga and makeup to look like my eyes have been stabbed out.

Slutty Pentecostal would be pretty easy. 




 Ok. This is kind of weird.

I hate the slew of slutty costumes, so I intend on mocking them this year. I'm pretty set on my two main ideas, but am unsure how to pull them off.

I will be spending Halloween night doing a bar crawl with some friends, including my bestie. My birthday is the 28th and hers is the 2nd, so we treat the whole thing as birthday Halloweek.

I'm torn between slutty Teddy Roosevelt and slutty Oedipus. With the former, I feel like I'd have to carry a big stick all night, which isn't conducive to bar hopping. I'm afraid that the latter may go over many people's heads.

I'm a 21 year old female (22 on the 28th), 5'8", and around 165 pounds, although I hope to continue losing weight until birthday Halloweek. I'm leaning more towards Slutty Oedipus.

Is there any way y'all could help me with either costume?

TL;DR: I'm torn between going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt and Slutty Oedipus for a bar crawl this Halloween, because I want to mock the slew of slutty costumes you see every year. Help? 




 Haha, if you can come down to Southern Indiana, they're free. 




 Good tip on the eggplant parm. That is also good, because one of the vegetarians also hates cheese, so I could just put less or none on top of a few slices. 




 And the step-dad's opinion clearly contradicts his Biblical argument. Turn the other cheek, hatred is bad; nope, some people deserve hate? 




 Yes! I'm a born and bred atheist, but I have read the Bible and bits and pieces of the Qur'an. Part of why I'm learning Arabic is actually because I want to be able to appreciate the poetry of the Qur'an. It's amazing how people identify as incredbly religious can be so ignorant. 




 I usually just buy distinctive ones. So I can see if someone is using a duck lighter of one with a sexy lady on it after the sesh, and know it's mine. 




 /R/tiltshift it's a photography style or an editing style that is designed to make big things look like miniature models. 




 He's just a big kitty. 




 Def the real ones. 




 Making croissants is one of my favorite things. Thinking about doing pain au chocolat for dessert and making them a day or two in advance, 




 Oh my goodness, that sounds fantastic. Definitely going to save this! 




 Good idea, although there is a distinct possibility that it will have already snowed by the time this is going on. Also, the only grill I have available to me is a mini one that was left outside by the previous tenant. 




 I would be so happy serving just a slew of seafood and shellfish, but I'm sadly the only one of my friends who likes it.

Coq au vin could be good, since it stews for so long it loses its "chickenyness," if you forgive my horrid made up word. 




 Good idea! And squashes are very easy to find around here, and the "health food" store a block from my place has them for months. 




 I've tried and tried to like them. In a stew, with rice, deep fried, baked, blended, I just don't like them. But at least I've tried. The two foods I will just not eat have gone through trying. 




 Duck sounds like a good option. Still just a roast bird, but so different from turkey. Plus, I could put my veggies for roasting under the bird. Vegetarian sides are easy, plus an entree.

I'll have to check out the lentil bolognese. Serious eats is always good, and I love lentils.

Edit:

I ADORE making pain au chocolat. When I make a batch of croissants, I usually do about half as pain au chocolat. And that way I cpuld make a not super sweet dessert a day or two in advance.

Pumpkin sage soup sounds really yummy, and serving it cold means I can transfer it to a bowl in the fridge, freeing up a pot for something else. 




 I get that. My vegetarian friends just always complain about how most big dinners are just that, and I totally understand. 




 I just see it as something totally different. Just like sometimes I just have an intense craving for Easy Mac, even though the proper, baked, three real cheese stuff is way better. 




 Ah! I'm planning on trying shakshuka for an extra credit dinner for Arabic class, anyway, so that's a great idea! I'll look into the pasta, too, although one of the strictest vegetarians invited also hates cheese. 




 That's a pretty good idea. I never even thought of using chickpeas because, personally, I have never found a way I enjoy them, no matter how I've tried (yes, including falafels and hummus). I'll look into this, and maybe try them out on the some people who like them before the big day. 




 Salad is a good idea. And I've been itching to make my own French Onion soup for a while. I'll keep both these in mind. Thanks! 




 All of that makes a lot of sense, especially about hor wellington really needs to be med rare. Idk about meats, but I know at least a couple of these people won't eat a fried egg if the yolk is runny at all.

As for roast veggies, I think that's now a pretty set menu item. So good and so easy. 




 That is a great idea! I will definitely be keeping that in my back pocket.

As for bread, I'm really lost. No one complained about brioche being top rich last year, even with the pound of butter and 12 eggs in the whole loaf. 




 I may very well just end up doing my ham again this year. It was really good, and then I can make stock for split pea soup, which is a must for me over the winter. A vegetarian lasagna or eggplant parmesan, or something with eggplants will probably be my veggie entree.

I'm trying to stay away from traditional Thanksgiving fair, as this will be after everyone else has gone home for it, anyway. 




 Haha, the weird jelly stuff from a can is one of my favorite Thanksgiving things, even though I've has the real stuff and that is the only thing from a can at home. 




 Ooh, fondue is a good idea, although I dont think I can fit another food gadget in my apartment. 




 For some reason, I really like cooking it all myself, besides a little help when I text someone a hour or two before because I'm overwhelmed. I think a big problem last year was that I tried making the brioche the same day. 




 For some reason, I really like cooking it all myself, besides a little help when I text someone a hour or two before because I'm overwhelmed. I think a big problem last year was that I tried making the brioche the same day. 




 Oooh, let's see if I can remember. It was pretty on the fly.

Prep your ham as normal (score in diamonds, put cloves where the scores intersect) and put it in the oven for about an hour, under foil. While that's going, throw and entire bottle of full sugar Dr. Pepper in a saucepan with sriracha, a touch of broth/water, a pinch of nutmeg, and whatever else makes it yummy. Let it reduce a bit. Take the foil off the ham and brush the glaze on the ham every 5-10 minutes till it's done.

Sorry it isn't the best recipe. I didn't follow one past what came up when I googled "how to cook a ham." 




 The main thing is that I'm trying to stay away from super traditional Thanksgiving things, because even a couple days after, I know I'm always so sick of turkey and cranberries and pumpkins.

Flank steak sounds awesome, as do stuffed portabellas. Thanks! 




 I love the idea of roasted beets and brussels! I'm nore looking for an idea for veggie entrees, but that, with the parsnips, baby taters, and rutebegas posted earlier will def be on my list of sides this year.

And yep, I love it, and I'm still in college. I always plan it the day or two before classes start back up after break, cuz at that point we have one week of normal classes, dead week, then finals week. It's good to start the final lap with good feelings and good food. 




 Oooh, I do love me some moussaka. I'll keep that in mind. 




 I don't know if that could be made big enough for an entree, but is def one of my favorite sides. 




 For the risotto, I used two packages of premade butternut squash soup and water for the liquid. Onions, carrots, celery in butter to sweat, then toast your rice. Add the liquid bit by bit while stirring. Add curry powder, red pepper flakes, and a dash of nutmeg towards the end.

The carrots I'm less sure of, but saute them in butter and oil till starting to get soft, then add honey, brown sugar, sriracha, red pepper flakes, and something else. I whipped those up on the spot, so don't know what all I added. 




 I fully apologize for the incoming wall of text. 

I know it's only early October, but the one dinner party I hosted last year was for "friendsgiving," and was the day before classes started back up after Thanksgiving break. It was so fun and I plan on doing it again this year.

I figure that people will be pretty sick of turkey by that point, so a different type of meat, plus a vegetarian option would be perfect.

Last year, I had a huge Dr. Pepper/sriracha glazed ham, curried butternut squash risotto, mashed taters, green beans with almonds, and spicy-sweet carrots, then a berry-lemon cheesecake for dessert, and home made brioche throughout.

I'd like to up my game this year. I think I'll make croissants instead of a huge brioche, but I'm unsure about everything else. The ham was amazing, and I had leftovers for a week, but I'll be inviting a bunch of the same people. I'm toying with the idea of a beef wellington, but I know about half the people don't like mushrooms, and even though you can't taste them too much in the finished dish, some people are really sensitive to the taste.

As for the vegetarian option, I'm at a loss. The risotto would have been good, but my big pot was being used for the taters, and I couldn't time things right. I'd like something I can start before the meat and sides.

Sides are confusing, too. The carrots were a hit, but I had to cook them and the green beans right before the ham was done, which meant having to scramble around while the guests were getting hungry. I don't really want to do taters this year, partially because I'm supposed to be cutting my carbs. Maybe a soup and a couple other things?

The cheesecake was bomb, but I'd like a fallback option in case my friend who makes it has to work.

Sadly, I will definitely just be getting a big box of wine to be going with dinner, but at least my friends' tastes have refined in the past year to go past white zin.

TL;DR: working on the menu for my friendsgiving this year. Need meat and veggie entrees, sides, and suggestions for dessert. Thank you all in advance! 




 I love making several batches. I don't scale up the recipe, I just work on one batch while the other two or three are chilling. There isn't as much down time, which I enjoy. 




 The only thing standing between me and my annual friendsgiving is the state of my tiny kitchen. Dead week (2 weeks after Thanksgiving, hoping I don't dislocate my knee that week for a second year), but my menu is fairly set. Means waking up early and spending a day cleaning, then waking up early the next day, prepping and preparing homemade brioche, a nice roasted ham, butternut squash risotto for the vegetarians, plus multiple side dishes.

EDIT: actually, OP makes me want to make a Beef Wellington with home made puff pastry, then just triple the pastry recipe and make croissants this year, instead of a huge braided brioche. 




 Chicken livers are also sometimes used as a substitute, although I'd be squeamish of those. But I love mushrooms and can't get past the fact that the liver is an organ that fikters out toxins. The only time I've eaten something and kind of enjoyed it, then got squeamish when I learned what it is was a foie gras pate in France while I was waiting for the crab caught 10 minutes away was being cooked. Escargot and frog legs however..... 




 The mustard museum in Wisconsin. I'm not sure exactly where, although my mind wants to put it between Madison and Appleton. It's not a specialty local food, but it is a magical place to stop on your food road trip. Sadly, I haven't been since I was a child and didn't want anything to do with mustard, but my parents always made it a priority stop when we were visiting family outside of Madison.

EDIT: on a similar vein, the Boudin sourdough company/factory is San Francisco. Yeah, you can get good sourdough elsewhere, but going on the full tour is amazing. And their bread is still better than any other sourdough I've ever had. My sister, who lives in Berkeley, signs me up for their bread of the month club for my birthday every year. It loses some quality on the trip to Indiana, but is still heavenly for a base for a Jarlsberg and salami sandwich. 




 Cloudberries, man. Some people have a gene that makes them taste like heaven. But they're really good to the rest of us, too. 




 I'm so much in camp A. I actually prefer Voyager to DS9 and TOS. It's tied with TNG, and I consider Enterprise to be different, mainly because the Xindi war just seems like a long movie.

I grew up watching early sci fi movies/shows. Some of the best memories I have with my father involve watching The Day the Earth Stood Still, the Twilight Zone, and the very very old Flash Gordon serials. Captain Proton, to me, is obviously Flash Gordon, which I love so so much.

As for the social commentary, that's a big reason why I love Voyager. Why is a sentient being that happens to be a hologram any different than one who is made of flesh and blood. While he can be grating, the doctor is one of my favorite characters in the whole universe (although Garak will always and forever be my absolute favorite). He has the attitide of Bones (kinda), the empathy and roundedness of Crusher, the uniqueness of Flox, and the intelligence of Bashir. 




 Same here. 




 Convenience is important. Sometimes you're out running errands or have a short break between classes and find yourself starving, but can't go home for whatever reason.

Slightly different, but there is a food truck here that just makes grilled cheeses. They know the college town market well enough to post up outside three of the biggest student bars Thursday through Saturday nights. I get a plain old grilled cheese with orange cheese like petroleum product and fries every time I go out. Yeah, I could walk 10 minutes home and make an amazing roast beef, swiss, and spinach panini on rye with honey and red pepper flake, but then I'd go to sleep instead of staying out with my friends more. 




 Also bbq. And wings. 




 Yes. I usually go for just PB sandwiches, because that's my preference, but my thinking is that, if you can grill your sandwich, you probably should.

One of my friends in high school always had the same 1st period class as me, and I would often make an extra grilled PB sandwich for her when I made one for nyself for breakfast. 




 Kinda looks like American poutine. But this is coming from someone who's never had real poutine, so take that with a grain of salt. 




 Don't have one. She did have a bit of a habit of biting things that stick out to wake me up when she was younger.... Still have puncture wounds, although I bet those would be even worse on the lower half.

Edit: I think part of it may have had to do with the fact that she was so young when she came to live with me. Probably still thought "those things on your chest mean food," being a mammal and all. 




 From what I've heard and my minimal experience, you are sometimes backed up for hours out on California freeways. I was once stuck on I465 South of Indy for 90 minutes and only moved about twenty feet. We were good on fuel before that, but the stalling and idling meant that we had to go refuel at the next opportunity. I'm guessing that's an entirely possible situation on most highways, sometimes to the point where you run out of gas when you intended on refuelling. 




 Wet willy meaning she licked the inside of my ear. Super not fun in any context, but worst when it wakes you up. 




 We have that back home, and Tiny Lion loves to be on the vent. He also loves curling up on my grandmother's lap and going for wheelchair rides, haha. 




 As I said earlier, it might when they're turned to full blast. But then the cats the curl up next to the radiator. They don't get hot enough to burn immediately of contact, and it's actually one of my favorite things in the winter to lay my pants on top of the radiator while I brush my teeth and stuff, then they're nice and toasty before I have to go face the cold. 




 I can't mount any shelves, as I'm in an apartment. I put a pillowcase or towel down so there's a barrier. When it gets really cold and I have the rads turned to full blast, they know better than to sit on it. Right now, they're fine because the rads are turned to as low as they can go. 




 I also will often use this premade soup as part of the liquid in a batch of risotto. I like fusion, so curried butternut squash risotto is one of my favorite things.

Ninja edit: I'm sure you know, but a little bit of nutmeg goes a long way. I have one of those shitty preground bottles, and I often find even one tap can be overpowering. 




 Second least favorite way to be woken up. The Sorority girl 10am Saturday scream when you're ungodly hungover is the worst. 









 This can be bad even when they aren't chatty. Source: one of mine woke me up at 3:30 this morning for breakfast with a scratchy wet willy. 




 You could always borrow a lady friend's brown eyeliner or shadow.
But I'm in your boat, too. Going as Slutty Teddy Roosevelt for a bar crawl. 




 I was part of the selection team for a literary magazine in high school (I know, I was super cool). Many English teachers offered extra credit to submit. One made everyone write five poems on the same subject for some assignment or another. The crowning jewel of horribleness (this kid should get a Ph.D. in it) was as follows:

Summer or winter

They are most likely somewhere

Animals are cool. 




 I'm a big fan of buying things the day before the sell by date and freezing individual portions. Means I can get a package of chicken thighs for $4 instead of $6-7. Just defrost, mix with some frozen veggies/rice (I have to cut down on rice myself, but it's dirt cheap and I believe makes a complete protein when mixed with the right veggies) and bam, easy cheap meal. 




 OP said he's using packaged soup. If you're making it from scratch though, these are all good tips.

OP, if you're ok with it, I love to add a bit of curry powder/paste. Maybe a smidge of nutmeg. 




 The only time I have ever actually looked for orange cheese like petroleum product was when I was in France. It was a thing to cook an American meal for your host family, so I figured an oclpp toastie and tomato soup was the way to go. Ended up with the ONLY orange cheese in the entire city and warmed gazpacho. Obviously better, but my host mom still didn't understand the appeal. 




 And it's pretty much pointless trying to get good real crab here in the Midwest. 




 Yes, someone else who loves giraffes! 




 This is one of those movies that should just not have a tv version. With how much they'd need to cut out, it coukdnt have bren more than 45 minutes long, right? It's like trying to watch the tv version of Showgirls. There's no point.
