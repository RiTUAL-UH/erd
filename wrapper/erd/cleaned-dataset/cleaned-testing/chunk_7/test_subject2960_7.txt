 How are supposed to act when you, not necessarily in a bad way, are the subject matter of a joke? Today  some coworkers were teasing me about the fact that I use both my first and middle names (I used to go by my middle name, but got tired of explaining it to people) asking if the reason was because i was in witness protection, or if I was an escaped criminal. One of the girls said "Here we are thinking Heavyheartwolf is a nice normal guy, when he's actually a criminal on the run from the police." I played along and said "Well you know they say sociopaths, that they always seem so nice on the outside" She laughed, but I felt maybe it was a little an awkward or strange thing to say. 

Is it best to play along in these kind of social interactions, or just play it off in some other way? 




 I don't know what you should say, but she's giving you a, not so subtle, indicator that you talk about your ex too much with her. I'm only starting to read into seddit and it seems like not talking about exs is a good rule.  




 I've found that it helps a bit, especially when you're meeting someone for the first time. From my own experience, people like to interact with others who are like themselves and have a very fine tuned sense for detecting otherness. Using a different diction can be alienating to people, because in their subconscious they identify you as not like them.

 I know I default to more complicated language, and it can be off putting to people who aren't familiar with that type of language. In casual conversation being concise seems to work better. When I'm speaking with close friends, family, or a formal setting I don't worry about using my diction because it's appropriate and accepted there.

 I'd say try be aware of it in casual conversation, but don't let it stop you from speaking well. Knowing your audience is a good thing to be aware of in a social setting. It's certainly a hard thing to do (because if you're anything like me some of your wording is second nature), but it's a good skill to have, and it'll help you communicate better with people who might not have as large a vocabulary as yourself.  









 I've just come out of a depressive episode a few months ago and have been steadily improving since. I'm still a little shook up from the episode that lasted almost two years. What I'm finding is that my motivation is taking a long time coming back. I've been leaving things till last minute and being generally pretty irresponsible. Anything that has the least bit of anxiety attached to it, like studying for a test, I just try to avoid like the plague. Has anyone else experienced this? 




 I'm going to school for journalism and creative writing. I've become very interested in story crafting and film, so I may go to film school when I'm done my degree. 




 For a long time I've been thinking about a tattoo, but could never find something that would mean enough to me to have put on me permanently. I've been reading a lot of old literature, and while reading up about Goethe's Faust I found some book illustrations that were exactly what I was looking for. Faust's moral about how you can lose yourself in the pursuit of knowledge is a meaning that deeply resonates with me. [this](http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/2/88505/1527676/02-clarke-faust.jpg) is what I'm thinking about getting. 




 Lately I've realized that I've spent years talking about myself. When I was young I spent a lot of time alone and became very introspective and self-conscious. Now, in my early 20's I've begun to try to change my behaviour and engage other people more, but I'm running into some road blocks.  I'm not very good at asking people about themselves and engaging their interests into general conversation topics. I'm really interested in getting to know people and connecting with them, but I draw blanks as to what I should ask them. I also don't want to sound like I'm snooping into their business, just that I want to get a little closer to them. How do you come up with on the spot, thoughtful, and interesting questions to ask people? Everyone asks each other how their day was, but what are some good ways to get passed that without the conversation becoming heavy or awkward? 




 Yeah it definitely feels like a fog, and it makes it difficult to connect to other people. I haven't always been this way, because I can remember having my emotions flow normally. When I sit down and think and try to relax I have an easier time identifying how I'm feeling and becoming grounded in the moment, but it takes conscious effort. 




 Interesting, I'll have to look into this if I'm not diagnosed as asperger's. But, seeing as how the symptoms are very similar there's certainly things I can gain and contribute here in the meantime. Also, as I said in another comment in this thread, I do have similar traits when it comes to special interests, so a diagnosis of asperger's isn't out of the realm of possibility.
 




 Yeah, I guess that I should say I'm alright at picking up on other people's social cues, but there are sometimes where they just fly over my head. I have other things that seem more autistic than just social anxiety. I've don't really know what to talk about with people outside of my interests. Haven't been diagnosed yet, but it's a possibility, and at the very least I have a lot of the same characteristics as someone with aspergers.  




 Lately, I've found that my anxiety is causing an emotional cloud that makes it difficult to make sense of my other emotions. If I'm experiencing another emotion it feels like it's just blurred by that tight feeling in the pit of my stomach. It feels like I'm out of touch with myself all the time, and because of this I feel like I'm not really interacting with the world around me. I think I've felt like this for years, 




 Thanks , I'm glad you think I handled it alright. I've never been very good at handling these sort of awkward/confrontational situations, and have only lately started to change how I deal with them. I've been finding humor and taking things to their logical end in an absurd way has been working well. It takes the momentum away from an awkwardness or confrontation, but it's taking some getting used to, and it doesn't always fly. are trying to be confrontational or passive-aggressive.  




 I got a 32, I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I have a lot of traits ( told by my psychologist) I'm good at picking up on other people's social cues, I just don't know what to say to people in real life, generally.  




 I was going to say this Stalker specifically, but many of Tarkovsky's movies fit the question. Everything about stalker is so carefully done and beautiful. It might just be my favorite film. 




 Yeah I definitely did it with the appropriate body language and chuckling. I wasn't just mumbling to myself or anything. I just felt (like always) that I could have dealt with the situation better, I need to think on my toes more. 




 I know, it was bad. I just can never think of something properly clever to say or when I try it comes out half baked, like that. I'm horrible at defusing situations like that. I can never keep a cool head. 




 Today at work I had what was quite possibly the most awkward encounter that I've had in months. I work at a coffee shop where I usually get along well (albiet awkwardly) with my coworkers, except my assistant manager. She's a naturally passive aggressive, in your face sort of person, and she just sends my social anxiety through the roof. Sometimes she's fine and we can have a pretty good conversations, but other times she just saps all my energy. Last week she put in her resignation and the week after next will be her last week working. I'm not particularly pleased about this, more relieved that my anxiety won't be triggered so much at work. Today she was joking around about leaving and said "Well I know HeavyHeartWolf won't miss me!", and this caught me totally off guard and I just said whatever came into my mouth. 

The exchange went something like this.

I immediately (without thinking) said in a sort of joking voice and a smile "ah Assistant-Manager that's harsh, you've got me figured all wrong!" To which she responded "haha don't you be thinking that I don't know what goes on in that pretty little head of yours" Then I turned and said "it is a pretty little head isn't it?" I didn't mean to come off as an ass, but I feel like I did anyway. Every time I'm thrown into a situation like this I just say the most idiotic things, because I don't know what else to say. Silence probably would have worked better looking back. 

What can I do to get myself socially on my a-game for when things like this come up. Every time something like this happens I feel like I botch the whole interaction and leave everyone feeling awkward. Do any of you have advice for getting better at this? 




 Yeah, I haven't seen it in a few years, so I my opinion of it might have changed. I think the idea of just going out and trying to authentically connect with people outside of the expectations that society places on us struck a chord with me.  




 I suppose if I'm diagnosed with asperger's then I'll have to learn to accept that I have some limitations socially and work on coping strategies to deal with and accept them. If it's not autism then it seems to me that what I'm dealing with is probably a result of severe anxiety and that I'll need to work on ways of building confidence and managing the anxiety through therapy, exposure, and medication if I need it. 




 Yes definitely, if I don't receive a diagnosis there are still a lot of things that I need to work on personally. I know that I have trouble socializing with people sometimes, I have a lot of anxiety, and I struggle with some obsessive tendencies. I'm really looking into Asperger's because it could explain a lot and as far as I'm concerned it's something that either is on the table or isn't, but I need to know moving forward. If I an aspie then there are some realities that I'll need to work with, if I'm not, then there are other reasons for some of my characteristics that I need to explore. 

I've been trying to find reasons and solutions for some of the things that are causing problems in my life. I don't think there's any harm in taking a look at the possibility of being asperger's. If I am I learn something about myself and move forward in one direction, if I'm not then I'll reassess somethings and move forward in a different direction. 




 If I get a diagnosis then it'll mean I have to manage my problems one way, if I don't get a diagnosis then it'll mean that I manage them another. What it really comes down to is finding out whether or not autism is on the table for me. I know I have some trouble socializing, I know I have some obsessive tendencies, but I'll be dealing with them in very different ways and mind-frames depending on whether I receive a diagnosis. 




 I'm currently pursuing an official diagnosis and have been dealing with a lot of anxiety about it lately, so please, bear with me. I've been being treated for depression for the last year, I had what I call a nervous breakdown and moved back in with my parents. I've been seeing a psychologist and brought to him the possibility that I might have either bipolar disorder or asperger's. He told me that I don't show many signs of bipolar, but there are some behaviours and thinking patterns that I have that might indicate asperger's. 

Now I've been studying up on it and while some traits are me in every colour, some just don't seem to apply. I've asked to do some screening tests with my psychologist, and have founds some credible ones online. The results of the test don't seem to indicate that I'm an aspie, actually I scored fairly low in a lot of categories. I can apparently read people's emotions better than average and am fairly good at deciphering people's intentions. 

It's a really confusing mix of indications, on one hand I fit the bill in many ways, but on the other I just don't seem like someone with asperger's. 

Did any of you who've been diagnosed deal with mixed indicators before getting your official diagnosis?  




 I think Into the Wild is close to what I'd consider an INFJ movie. I've that there are more films that involve similar themes in foreign cinema. Wim Wender's film Der Himmel Uber Berlin (Wings of Desire) and the films of Andrei Tarkvosky spring to mind. If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind subtitles then I'd recommend giving those a watch. 

For english movies I'd say that Spike Jonze and Wes Anderson are two directors who explore a lot of themes that INFJs can relate to. Where the Wild Things Are is one of the best children's films I've seen. 




 I've been told that I'm a bit intimidating on first introduction, but only because (I've been told) I look and sound like an intelligent, confident person. I was surprised by this at first, but I take it as a real compliment. I've had people tell me that the reason I seem intimidating is that I'm an attractive young person who seems to talk about things and hold stronger well thought out beliefs than many people my age. I actually have quite a lot of problems with being self critical and insecure, so the idea that I can seem confident and collected means a lot to me.  




 Actually, I wrote this entire post about how I'm really self-conscious and actively avoid sounding like a pompous elitist in my everyday life by bringing in topics that don't interest most people. I don't reject other people or their interests. In fact, I could listen to someone talk to me about their passion almost regardless of whatever that passion for as long as they were willing to talk. 

I think you read my post thinking I have no interest in the people around me when that's far from the case. I'm not resentful of other people or have low expectations of them, I'm just trying to avoid being condescending or seeming pretentious, because I know that sometimes I can be unintentionally. I tried to make it understandable in my post that I like to interact with people and chat with them about things and other interests, but I haven't found a way to incorporate this large piece of my life into socializing without seeming like I'm doing it just to flaunt.

I hope that makes sense. I didn't mean to imply that other people are inferior to me, just that a lot of people have no interest in that sort of thing. Other people reference things like TV shows in everyday conversation all the time, because those around them can relate to those things. My problem is that some of the things I'd like to reference aren't as easily accessible and I have to check myself before throwing references to things that it might be difficult for others to relate to into a conversation.  




 Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning. 

 I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. 

I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues.

Do any of you feel the same way? Do you have any experiences to share?

  




 Both of my parents are working professionals. My mom took ten years off after finishing her degree to raise me and my brothers. For the first ten years my parents were very loving and involved. After my mom went back to work she become completely focused on her professional career, and me and my brothers have definitely suffered for it. We moved towns a few times because of my parents work, they never really had any concern for our development or whether we were okay. We lived in a series of small towns where it was difficult to fit in socially as an outsider. My teenage years were spent in an isolated, northern rural town.  My parents basically stopped being invested in me and my brothers when I was 10 and sort of left us to our own devices. Now they're surprised that me and my brothers have problems connecting to people and all suffer from anxiety and depression. I've been struggling with depression since I was 12 and my parents tell me that they never noticed anything until I had to move home to get help.

 So no, my parents weren't abusive, but I feel they emotionally abandoned me and my brothers to focus on their careers. This involved throwing us into a lot of bad environments because they didn't do their homework i.e. really crazy babysitters and subpar schools. They never made much effort to make sure that my brothers and I were socializing normally and that we were emotionally alright. I can only guess that I've become an INFJ because I had to deal with loneliness and sadness for a long time without much emotional support. Maybe it's that I turned to religion, literature, and music at a young age to try to manage my pain. I've since become an agnostic, but I can remember taking solace in religion when I dealt with depression as a child. Now I'm a little jaded, a bit poorly adjusted and have a lot of anxiety, but at my core I'm very empathetic and yearn for a deeper connection and understanding with people.

It wouldn't surprise me to hear that other INFJs have suffered some form of desertion early in their lives. Maybe it's why INFJs want deeper meaning and connections with others. 




 I've noticed that with certain people I always end up having the same conversations. It's great that we have similar interests and that we get along, but I really want to get a little deeper and talk about something other than just our common ground. How do you start a conversation that doesn't seem obvious, and how do avoid getting stuck in a conversation rut? I like talking about the things we talk about, but sometimes I wish we'd talked more about each other rather than just things we enjoy.  




 I'm like that. It makes me feel good to share my passions, experiences, and opinions. Lately I've become a little self-conscious about sharing too much because I'm trying to engage other people about themselves more. 

With money and possessions I share too much. I buy for friends sometimes just because I like too. If I have extra money, most of the time, I'd rather spend it buying drinks for friends than buying things for myself. I like cooking people for people. There's something primevally communal about making a meal for friends.
