 Were you given a reason? I was banned for posting an article entitled "Republicans for Sanders" (which sounded relevant to /r/republican to me). When I asked them about it (very politely, I might add), they responded with cryptic threats (something about how they'll destroy me on the field of battle or something). It was pretty disturbing, to be honest.

No actual reason was given, which isn't surprising as I didn't break any of their rules and was always respectful (never negative or inflamatory). In fact everything that I've posted there has been received dozens of upvotes (except one post which sat at 1 point). 




 GMO labeling is one of the few things (2%, apparently) that I disagreed with, too. Pretty minor issue as far as I'm concerned.

 In other words, stimpacks for married people.

This is the exact scenario that keeps me from even considering a stimpack:

"Okay, got my work done, all the chores are done, spent every moment of free time with the wife this week, nothing on the calendar... no reason why I shouldn't be able to play a lot this weekend. Stimpack purchased!"

"You're not spending enough time with me."

"Fuck." 




 Point people to something like isidewith.com. They're usually surprised by the results. 





























































































































































































  Hillary brings the name, Bernie brings the politics.

Well put!
