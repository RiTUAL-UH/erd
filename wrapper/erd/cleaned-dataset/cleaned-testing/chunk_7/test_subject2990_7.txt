 You literally wasted your time writing that. By noobs I also mean people who play safe and know whether you can kill the person or not just by looking at there build (Solo Laners) 




 Well, I am currently lvl 25 I'm trying to get to ranked and see how well I do, but I want someone that knows how to play the game well and teach me a lot more. I can play top,jungle and adc. I don't support unless I really got to. I am really good I know how to build when someone is fed or not, and counter build to beat my opponent in my lane. I'm just looking for a good team so I can get into ranked and mess some people up and have fun. If you would like to play with me add me on League or Steam or Skype.

Hope you get around playing with me and thanks. I'm just not looking for noobs who are stupid and make dumb decisions I'm not saying I play the game seriously either I just wanna have fun.
