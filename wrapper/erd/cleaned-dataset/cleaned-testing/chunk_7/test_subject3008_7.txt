 Some friends of mine are fans of Insane Clown Posse

They spray you with Faygo throughout the show, and at the end, poured fucking glitter on everyone. 

They told me about this ^ and I decided I'd never join them on there journeys to the I.C.P. concerts.
I hate sticky stuff and glitter.
Nope nope nope nope. 




 That's great. I
still have that bad experience. I'll attempt to quit berating the plasmas but I refuse to get one. IMO It's not a big enough difference in picture quality to rebuild my confidence in plasma. 




 I hate plasma tvs only because the first one I owned messed up. I watched history channel a lot and eventually the logo burned into the screen. I hear they don't do that or not as bad. I still have trust issues. I'll take a barely noticeable lower picture quality over worrying about burned in logos everyday. 




 Plasma... ha! LED smart tv by Samsung is the way to go. My next will be one of their UHD televisions. 




 I had the same problem. I turned 24 and FAFSA finally saw me as an independent. Now I have loans to repay due to the original issue. So until my loans are paid off, I'm not qualifying for a grant. 




 If /u/Sarcastic_Redneck went to school in Memphis, he could be tagged Girafica in Memphrica. 




 I always got picked on but the reason was unknown. The kids always just targeted me without any reasons as far as I knew. I never understood what I'd done to them. Now I'm very successful and quite wealthy. Joke's on them. 




 If it were up to me? I'd die on the battlefield during war in the uniform of the United States Army. 




 1. I am not in danger, (insert name here). I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!
2. Yo lunchbox, hurry it up.
3. In a world gone mad, we will not spank the monkey, but the monkey will spank us. 




 Revenge:

1. Scoop the poop while he's watching
2. Drop it on his lawn
3. Make and keep eye contact during the next steps
4. Find something like a brick and smush it into his lawn
5. Scoop more poop
6. Sling it at his vehicle
7. Blatantly deny it as he confronts you

Alternative revenge:

1. Collect poop everyday.
2. Place daily poop in a paper bag
3. Set said bag on his porch/front steps etc
4. Light fire to said bag
5. Ding dong ditch
6. Blatantly deny it all
7. Repeat daily 




 I get calls from them once every 30 minutes from 6 am until 10 pm. Talk about persistent. I've told those leeches I'll get the money top then when I HAVE the money. You can't have what I don't have. Plain and simple. If I have zero, you can have exactly that! Zero. 




 Oh you poor sucker. I have an 04 Sebring. I had to get a new battery for it. That sucked. For anyone who doesn't know about some models of Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, the battery is behind the splash guard that's behind the front left tire. Most of the time you'll have to raise the car up and remove the tire and the splash guard just to change the battery. Inconvenient as hell. 




 Hell yeah! Mark the filters. I've known plenty of places to fuck the customer over a fucking $5 filter. I change my own oil. When I couldn't due to rules, I would mark my filter. Fuck those ripoff happy assholes. 




 I tried the Cutco thing a couple years ago. The only people in my "class" that had any success were from rich families that were connected to other rich families. 




 Saving this 




 I used to play tibia on Amera all the time. Made plenty money USD. People on that game pay lots for tibia gold. 




 Saving private penis 




 Arguing. It's quite enjoyable. 




 TIL I wasn't such a bad child. 




 I've got a solution to your "problem". Pay for my education, let me graduate, then I'll tell them to call me asking for donations and such twice as often as they call you. They just have to stop calling you. I'll add them to my automatic ignore list and BAM! Solution. 









 All I can think of is Ralph, from The Simpsons. 




 I don't wanna pick a best. I'll list a few favorites.

Disclaimer: these are my own opinions. They do not make me right nor do they make me wrong.

1. Scrubs - it outlines the base idea of the show. No one can work in such an environment on their own. No one should try to be "superman" and do everything themselves.
2. Ground floor - it's just really fun and that's what the show is.
3. Breaking Bad - it's very mysterious and tense while also mellow. It also has a desert feel to it, which is logical  since that's where it mainly takes place. I don't think anyone could have picked a better theme song for the show. 




 Not a pro cleaner but I have a great tip.

Mix 1 part liquid fabric softener to 9 parts water in a clean empty spray bottle.

Save money on that blue fabric spray. Use it on curtains and soft furniture. 




 This is my only cleaning product. It'll make everything brighter. Toilet bowls, sink, shower, white tile floors, tile grout. Great stuff. 




 I use shop towels. They're a few dollars for a fat roll of them at AutoZone or similar auto parts stores. 




 Disclaimer: this is my opinion which means it does not make me wrong nor does it make me right.

If you fit into one of the following categories, you are a completely helpless dumbass who doesn't deserve a computer:

1. People who can't disassemble and reassemble a computer for maintenance. (Removing dust, diagnosing power issues, etc.)
2. People who can't build their own computer
3. People who think "just turn it off then on again" will actually solve every problem with a computer

Reasoning: There are too many tutorials on YouTube and the rest of the internet for this simple stuff. I've contributed to a handful of these tutorials for those who don't know how to. You are a dumbass if you willingly decide to act as though you can't figure it out. There are text only tutorials, text and picture tutorials, and video tutorials. 




 I have my own personal favorite. Jack and Jack. 2 oz Jack Daniels over 2 more oz Jack Daniels. Never chilled, no ice. Perfect. 




 I'm a cheapskate. Payless and Wal-Mart 




  You see....
Everything comes down to poo!
From the top of your head, to the sole of your shoe
We can figure out what's wrong with you by lookin' at your poo! 




 The only way shoes will be worth $3000 is if there is $2950 cash in the box. 




 I'm the same way. 




 /u/theobscure was half right. It's one of the two he/she guessed. My wife grew up in north Mississippi. 




 Anna Gunn. Why the fuck not? 




 Well this thread adds another layer of boring to my user name. I guess I could confuse people on how my user name is pronounced (without the "j") 




 Unemployment-man 




 I'll check him out. 




 I'll check them out. 




 Really funny guy. I've seen his Netflix special though. 




 Thanks. He's really funny. 




 I've seen Louis C.K. on Netflix. Great comedian. Thanks for the response. I'll check out the other two. 




 Life with Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy. It's barely 15 years old but I like it... I found out about it when I was working at MSP (the penitentiary in the movie). *whites only pie* (proceeds to burn mouth trying to inhale pie). 




 It's *leave*, you idiot! "Make like a tree, and leave." You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong. 




 Over the years when I'd try to watch this, something would happen to interrupt this movie. I usually wouldn't get past the boat scene. Well, the other night I downloaded and watched it. I love war movies and this one is one of the greats. I hate that I'm so late to this movie. Still a great movie. 




 Omg. I sometimes forget how old that movie is. Geeze, I feel old. 




 Me too (watched it this past weekend and know it line for line and still enjoy every minute). I have all three on Blu-ray. 




 Forest Gump. Saw that movie when it came out. It's always a great movie. I watch it about once a week. 




 I would've said something similar "the movie theater near me... wait there isn't one". Damn small town. 




 I'm looking to watch a good stand-up comedian preferably available to watch on Netflix. I love comedy and wish to watch something right now. I like John Pinette, Ralphie May, Fluffy (I can't spell his last name), Katt Williams, Kevin Hart, and others like these. If any of these has a special on Netflix, I've seen it. Any serious suggestions are truly appreciated. I either can't do the serious tag from the app I use or I just don't know how so please keep the answers serious.

Edit: I received a lot more responses than I had expected. Thanks guys. A lot of suggestions were new names to me. I should have thought to mention that I've seen Louis CK, Bill Burr and Jim Gaffigan. Thanks again and keep them coming. 




 Late too this thread but: Apple for scale 




 You're half right. 




 Same here. I never have been comfortable with my wallet anywhere but my front pocket. 




 My wife grew up down the street from two current nfl stars who happen to both be brothers. She didn't know them on a personal level but did know them. I'm aware how boring this is. 




 Ha! I wish. Unfortunately, no.
