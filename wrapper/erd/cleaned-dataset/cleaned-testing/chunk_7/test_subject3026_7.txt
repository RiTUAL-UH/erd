 socialism is a big mean scary word that most americans have no clue what it means.

we as a country are mostly functionally retarded. WE got people on medicare(gov provided healthcare) protesting the idea of socialized healthcare.. its like what teh fuck do you think medicare is.. they dont fuckin know, all they know is socialism sounds similar to communism so it must be the same and evil. heck 40% of us think man lived with dinosaurs.. how the fuck we got to the moon is anyone guess.
 




 yeh no different than the one last year...
and the thing is.. THEY SUCK.. even on the special surface.. the lack of friction just ruins your abilities to really do anything.  you would need little jets in it, to help with tricks and movements and yeah that seems odd since they want their wheels to roll as smooth as possible but you need friction for the cool shit.
 




 I cant speak for others.. and am white, but i didnt like it at the statehouse. I have zero problem with people buying it.. displaying it.. what ever. You cant make people like you, the point is to not make it institutionalized by government.

and part of the point is WHY the state put it up.. it wasnt for history it was for bigotry, i dont think the dukes did it for bigotry, it really is and was prevalent around the south and not everyone was bigots that used it.. it the intentions.

There is also a black dude here who calls himself the black confederate. i dont know him, or his intentions.. but have seen him a few times. heis car has all kinds of little confederate crap all over it.. little confederate flag door locks and crap.

 




 I do find it so amusingly ironic that this little bigotshit wanted to start a race war and instead is going to end up doing something for black people the naacp hasnt been able to accomplish in decades of trying.. and they even did economic boycotts that did cost my state millions.. no one gave a fuck.

Not that he deserves any praise for all this, it is just more than delightfully ironic.
 




 wake me up when the klan flies a robert e lee.. manikin or something 




 hmm i was sure fake but now not so sure

[here are more picts and an article.](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/01/mirage-house-kois-associated-architects-rooftop-pool/).. and there is a home under the pool, behind that outdoor deck under the pool is a door.


[here is the guys who allegedly built it and they have some other unique designs and those are definitely real.](http://www.koisarchitecture.com/) (warning website sucks)

so to all the people who say fake... you might want to double check 




 ~~like the invisible skylight lighting up the couch under the pool.. yeah they could have a super bright light they leave on all day..~~

eh.. looked at builders site.. marking this plausible.

[here is the guys who allegedly built it](http://www.koisarchitecture.com/).. they also did build some very real and verifiable things.

it does include a floor plan.

[here is an article on the house with more picts](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/01/mirage-house-kois-associated-architects-rooftop-pool/)

and it was [picted up by other archi sites](http://www.designboom.com/architecture/kois-associated-architects-mirage-residence-aegean-06-02-2014/)

idk a lot looks like cgi but some picts dont, and while they say imagined, they say its on the north side of the island.. there are no good recent google earth views.. so idk.

edit: yeah that is just [designs by the firm on a house they are commissioned to build](http://www.luisaworld.com/a-pool-with-a-view/#more-8855)

but i do wonder how they are going to get to teh pool.

 




 anyone have any ban emails we can check out?

I'm not doubting and such but here we have an extreme problem with BS. Once again.. not doubting.. but you hear all the time in like the perk subs and bing subs of people all following the rules and getting banned and it causes all kinds of outrage and people freaking out but then you look and well none of it is true.. they were cheating but it ends up creating all kind of crockery where you see on here "if you bing make sure you cash in from a different ip than you search from"

as if that wouldnt actually set off a flag cause  normal people wouldn't do that.

or in perk its 'dont watch just the app trailers or get banned'

or 'dont play the perk quiz in lightning mode or get banned'

and well you see more bs about the ways to get banned than actual helpful info.

and yeah i know they can be vague, as they dont give a fuck about us.. but any kind of communication on the subject would be helpful.
 




 its crazy we have to create a fake religion to show the religious how stupid they are.. (and sorry but most satanists are fakers)..  but i think we need to flood the south with new religions.. give the people some choices, and give state houses dozens and dozens of fights over displays until they say they have to stop all religious because they cant have that many displays.

but one important thing, we got to learn from the religious(and sorry but its mainly the religious right) and get insanely upset at even the slightest thing that we can even slightly twist into an attack against us. Spell satanist with a low case S.. you are oppressing me. But we got to get really upset all the way to the sole.. (not a mispellin) like they fake they do to get their way.

you know how they are.

 dumbass "gays are evil pedophile bastards and should be put to death"

me "man thats a bit harsh, didnt jesus say love thy neighbor and shit"

dumbass "why are you oppressing my freedom of speech with personal attacks.. i cant even talk about my faith anymore without you hateful people attacking me." 




 Your question reminds me of a convo i had with a very right wing christian on reddit.

he tells me that many of his friends think the new pope is satan. That kinda shocked me to hear. Obama ok.. or chenney or someone else but the pope? Basically hes been saying the worlds got to worry about the poor more.(ok i get some things he has said are anti-right wing.. but then again anything not pro right wing is anti right wing).

you might disagree with him but you know he sneaks out at night, and washes the poor feet, and shit like that that jesus used to do. he seems like an ok dude.

dude came back that satan would fool the world by being a good dude... just like the pope.(which basically they have their bases covered cause he can be anything from insanely evil, to a really good dude)

But to make a long ramble have a point...

Even if some christians might think what they are doing is good and noble, they might still think they are actual satanists... er worship some dude called satan cause being good is exactly one of those dirty rotten things satan might do. 




 sounds like a constitutional scholar.

/s

edit: actually  the title isnt quite correct

If the couple does not want to have a religious wedding then they are free to simply file an affidavit attesting that they are married, Courser said. They can do this without ever having to have a ceremony.

A lot of states are mostly like this.. even the ones that are already legal. No one forces the priests and if you cant find one you get a notary or some witnesses and sign an affidavit...IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A CEREMONY.. and you send this in and get your license. IF YOU DONT WANT A CEREMONY.. you can just go down to the county offices where you get the licenses and get married by a justice of the peace. This is the part he wants to change. Its still retarded and probably not legal.. but its not quite how the title makes it out to be, cause 90% of it is how it is already.. the only part is the removal of the justice of the peace for people who dont want a ceremony with friends.. people who do .. do an affidavit.. thats kinda the point of the affidavit over the justice of the peace. And i actually married some friends legally in SC being a notary. it wasnt a same sex wedding but it was a legal wedding.(its easy to keep judges out of weddings, hard out of divorses)  




 sorry its late.. gotcha you see the icon but it says disconnected.

really starting to sound like hardware failure. it can happen without having other problems on the pc, kinda rare but yeah it can happen, you can look arround the pci port you installed the card in for any damage to the board.

it really sounds like you hit all the bases from the software standpoint.
 




 ok, this might not be you, a lot of people dont see this at all.. but some of us have a reaction like you.

I used a vamo forever and 12 mg like you.. its comparable to your spinner in power. No problems, never a problem.  i got a istick50 and kangertank.. and exact same as you. it killed me. now someone else on youtube had this problem but cant find the link.. looked for someone else.. he was just a random reviewer.. it was the pg.

i switched to 100% vg, and i can vape 18mg at 30 watts(i was making someone else some juice when i went as high as 18) no problems.


its weird cause i heard of people sensitive to pg, but it never bugged me at the lower watts and higher ohms.. i can do 20% but at 50 it kills me.

but yeah also if you didnt prep the coil with liquid before you hit.. and sometimes when its flooded it can be kinda harsh. 




 in device manager, make sure 'show hidden devices" is checked under view.

and did you just try reinstalling the realtek drivers from their site? 




 my sennheiser's are the same way, except they actually hide the metal in a sheath(beats might too but from the pictures in the tear down it doesnt look that way) and sennheiser ARE quality.. so.. who wrote this shit. 




 yeah your both right wtfoosball and oldstinkfinger.

if you click [through to the actual tear down the first pict, shows it plainly](http://i.imgur.com/edjJbiQ.jpg)

both the hinge and the slide. They arent even hidden from the user it doesnt look like. Beats do suck, but this isnt why.


sennheisers have the same parts..  




 spontaneous dancing' is illegal in Sweden, and owners of bars, clubs and pubs without a special dancing license face fines if their patrons decide to take to the floor.

In March this year, politicians voted in the Riksdag to lift the bizarre ban - but it failed to pass, and Swedes still need government permission if they fancy a dance.


whoa what the fuck swedes
 




 so how does this bode for open source world? they dont exactly have to be reversed engineered. i know clamav isnt that popular but there are a lot of open source security tools.

also isnt a lot of this done by the private markets and  then sold to the nsa, i seem to recall that one browser challenge where that group that cracked all three, didnt accept the winnings because they would have to say how and they make more money selling that info to governments. 




 wait.. did they remove it?

[abortion is illegal under any and all circumstances in chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Chile)

I dont see where it is legal even after 3900 weeks.

(and no i am not anti abortion.. just for clarity.. just a sardonic joke)
 




 I agree with you in principle but  when citizens united got ruled, its hard to deny that the amount of money spent on politics in the us went up dramatically. And while it might not be due to the same issues, its also hard to deny how far right the right went when it came to corps.(though most of this is probably due to the left moving right, making the right move further to distinguish itself) 




 i got a wheel from daniel.
 




 well i didnt doubt the facts were true. It just is more helpful if they actually adjust the dollars if they are talking about rising costs.

I don't recall any game changing medical technologies between these two timezones.

really? did you click? it goes from 1960 to 2014

MRIs were invented in the 70s// increases in cancer research, fuck we got better eye surgury and bionic limbs... that can be controled by the brain.. and kids that can hear who were deaf all theri lives.


our life expectancy in [1960 was 66 years for men 73 for women.](http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html)

[today our life expenacy is 76 years for men, 81 for womn](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/08/us-life-expectancy-hits-record-high/16874039/)

thats an added decade in the most medically expensive time frames.

In summary: US healthcare is expensive due to predatory insurance.

dont disagree.. but there are caveats you cant ignore. IF we mislead on the other side of the spectrum we are doing just as wrong as those that pretend the insurance markets are doing us right. meaning while most of the increase can be attributed to predatory insurance, not 100% can be.

There weren't any monumental technological innovations between the two numbers It's, at best, the same as always.

but if we are looking at the same graphs you cant be more wrong on that point.. cause mine starts in 1960 and is very different than today.




fixed a link. 




 well thats why i made the point of heating it up..

but hey.. everyone in this thread says metals dont cause cancer so go ahead and downvote all teh proof they do.

and chromium can cause cancer if it was dissolved. as the first study shows. thats why i suggested a solvent in his mouth.

so while the doctor said it was possible.. he would have to take a fuck ton of heat to the mouth and have his pick vaporized or dissolved.

you also ignored the nickel part.. still its the same as the hexavalent chromium as far as cancer is concerned.. vaporized or dissolved.


no where was i suggesting holding a pick in your mouth with a magnet caused cancer'

 




 you're in cordcutters what do you care if cable tv goes up?
 




 i would love to hear how he came up with his theory. Did it have a crazy path, or did he just choose the picks and magnets right off and added a little em in there for extra measures.
 




 well if they were [chromium or nickel](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9498900) .. they could cause cancer, though its a bit hard unless you heat them up a lot. (not a doc but know those are known to cause cancer with workers who make shit out of them and there have been picks made of chromium though kinda rare) maybe a solvent in his mouth.. lol. [But there are also worries for us e-vapors as our kanthal often spews a bit of chromium and nickel. Though there hasnt been definitive proof yet.](http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarettes-emit-levels-nickel-and-chromium-4-times-higher-tobacco-smoke-300704)

i kinda figured it was the tortoise shell he was going to talk about.. friend of mine used to jam.. i set him up with picks with strike anywhere match head crap glued to it and a matching sandpaper on his guitar so when he played solo it looked like he played so fast his pick caught on fire.. but anyways that smoke is pretty nasty.

edit added some sourcing.. this is skeptic after all.

edit, i guess some people missed the heating and solvent part.. i did include sources, for skeptics yall seemed to miss that too. I wasnt justifying him.. just that metals can cause cancer in certain conditions. if your going to downvote, at least tell me which words you think are false.. to vap chromium you need heat.. to disolve it you need a solvent, the link shows it causes cancer. we are hear to learn, not saying I am write, but yall havent proven me wrong by saying "it needs to be vaporized" sure and that takes a lot of heat. which is in my comment already.

 




 yeah you can.. and [there are a few vertical rebuilds.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kanger+occ+vertical)

for the burn, a couple things yo can do. get a tiny safety pin and put holes very gently in the side of the cotton, or use a higher pg mix which thins out the joose. also dont let juice get below the coil head. this [guy does a good video on various subtank fixes, including the dry hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JwHQ9OYwVw)

and [you can get new heads a little over a dollar a piece at fasttech](https://www.fasttech.com/search?occ).. for generics,  $2 for authentics. 




 I'll do one more. I hate the stupid bigoted flag. i dont think it should fly at the sc statehouse. its not even historically accurate for sc.

I have zero problems with people buying that flag, flying it at their own home, while dressing in a klan uniform and burning a cross(depending on fire laws)

i have zero problem with walmart selling it if they wanted to.

edit:so yall disagree? what part? that i called the flag bigoted? it wasnt used in sc besides by the klan and to protest the civil rights era, sc used the palmetto. or do you just disagree that bigots should be able to buy it? Just downvoting and not explaining yourself besides against reddiquette is pretty low effort in debates.

 




 At first i was going to dismiss this out of hand.. as there seems to be little relation and i have been through many loses and i have never been stimulated by the loss.

however, when you win, you often go otu to celb.. if you arent already out watching the game. when you lose you go home.. or stay there. So i can actually see their conclusions as a scientifically valid guess.(i am not sure they accounts for all variables like perhaps a well known uab college girl had some pron post up or maybe she broke up with half the people at UAB.. eitherway that would probably increase views) 




 two points i made in a different sub.. with this post.

1. you can partially blame documentaries that call ostriches living dinosaurs.. and that fish i forget the name of atm.

2. 1/3 of the country does not believe in evolution at all even "god guided evolution"  but do believe that dinosaurs existed and some believe in the time scales.. they 'simply' dont believe in evolution, so humans had to exist at the same time.

this isnt a justification, just a look at the areas we need to work on.

but really i would like to see a fuck ton of work on how we do science documentaries. IF you say living fossil or living dinosaur you best let them know you dont actually mean an actual live dinosaur, just that this creature resembles its ancestors a lot.

also get rid of all the anthropomorphism when talking evolution.. you are making things worse. No animal plans evolution and yet EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY Documentary suggests they do. the corpse plant didnt decide to smell like rotten meat.. the corpse plant doesnt even fucking know or have any way to know what rotten meat even smells like. If there was any planning.. it was done by the fucking flies.


no fucking animal said, hey them low leaves are all getting eaten.. wouldnt it be better if we had long ass necks to eat the ones on top? no the ones with short fucking necks died out quicker than they could breed and the ones with the long necks didnt so rthe fucking necks got longer.. no fucking planning. Its hard to really blame the religious when it comes to the shit state of our evolution reporting.. we make it sound like an intelligence is behind it.. just a scientific one.. that sounds a lot like what the religious claim and its not anywhere near the accurate.

the only time an animal 'decides' its evolution is through sex display but even then, their isnt a lot of deciding going on, on the evolution side.. you know we might like big tits and tits got bigger but we didnt decide to make women have bigger tits.. ok mans a bad example cause we can do that now.  but the point is there is no conscious decision to evolve. God or not.
 




 8.1

 




 500,000 years? eh.. pretty much do everything we do here on the planet earth rn now would be good enough.

edit: take it back, I'm not quite sure that would be enough, the pressure is way low and i dont know enough about all we add to the atomosphere. 




 yes unplug it so it boots to windows over the usb stick 




 name the boner killer/.

next week, the friends of these 13-14 year olds who have trouble getting condoms of their own but seem to invent new ones... are going to invent the prank version that changes color when it contacts any pussy. Ahhh good times good times

 




 "It has nothing to do with the flag, nothing at all," he said.

well except the flag wasnt ever used in SC except by the klan and to fight civil rights  100 years after the civil war.. it is solely a symbol of bigotry.. unlike the african american monument.

Plus the man sorta admits his bigotry.. its one thing to not support the removal of the flag but the fact that he wants to remove an african american monument as payback for removing his, shows he is overly bigoted. when both sane black people and sane white people want it taken down.


"My great, great, great grandfather and ancestors fought in this war for this state," he said.

and lost. Yall keep forgetting that part. YALL ROSE UP AGAINST THESE UNITED STATES THAT YALL CLAIM TO LOVE SO MUCH... AND FUCKING LOST. and it wasnt put up on the aniversity of the civil war. It wasnt put up to honor the civil war. It isnt even accurate to sc's position in the civil war. It was put up to fight segregation and the people who put it up said it was due to the north wanting to force desegregation despite god always intended the races to be separate.


there are people here who emigrated from germany after the war.. should we fly nazi flags for them?


You heritage freaks dont have a leg to stand on.. it wasnt put up to honor heritage and if we wanted to honor heritage we would have used the SC confederate flag over the virgina one. It was put up for bigotry.

PS challie chapin had a tooth brush mustache, but wear one today, and people are going to assume you are a nazi. Is that fair?  probably not but like it or not, people are that offended because the last person to use it was a raving bigot. Same with that stupid ass flag. Douche bag knows damn well why it was put up.

and even.. lets just say this asshole is dumb enough to believe it is soley heritage and states rights.. this assholes rose up agains teh US, killing many us citizens and lost.(many in texas fought for the mexican side.. of that war.. should they get to put up the mexican flag over government buildings in theri town? FUCK NO.. THEY LOST). you can argue if it is right or wrong we still have that land today, but you cant argue it isnt part of the US. Same with teh south, lose the flag of the enemy.
 




 well while i dont doubt it is still true.. for a bunch of reasons. that stat is meaningless unless adjusted for inflation.

hey i could be missing it but i dont see anywhere it says it is listed in constant dollars.

But also healthcare gets more expensive as we learn new methods of keeping you alive for longer and will go up regardless of inflation.
As well as the fact we live longer. 




  That being said people are really hard for robots to work on. They move quickly and are all unique.

not as big of a problem as you think anymore. WE have robots now that are learning to be smart enough to deal with totally unique, never seen before situations.. like the differences in humans or the differences in folding random clothes tossed in a box.
 




 I'm not sure if this is totally true. Well maybe from a data standpoint but darwinian evolution says giraffes where had longer necks survived because they had more access to food.. etc.. where id says god decided he wanted some long ass necked animals.

the main difference to me.. scientifically is one is semi predictable, the other isnt.

i know that on small landmasses animals tend to be smaller.. where in id, you got to guess that god wanted some cute smaller versions of certain animals and decided to place them on islands. 

or the all female lizards that clone themselves.. darwinian evolution says they will most likely have problems and that its not a good evolutionary strategy to live as clones.. god guided says nah, if god wants to the lizard to survive it will.. doesnt matter its evolutionary state.
 




 I dont have the data on hand, but yeah this phenom is well studied and if i remember correctly the percent of snarks seems to be rather steady. But it is a well known problem and if you look at certain gallup survey type polls(not so much on do you approve of such and such job), and read their little disclaimer on the bottom they specifically mention things like this. And that the poll is adjusted accordingly.

sometimes as simple as asking the same questions over with different wording, as snarks often forget what they said to the last one 20 questions ago.

also, you cant really blame them to much.  Documentaries often call birds, especially ones like the ostriches as living dinosaurs. [Though i highly suspect it has more to do with our beliefs in evolution where 1/3 fully reject the idea, most believe in god guided evolution, where only 15% believe in darwinian evolution.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060810-evolution.html).. see they might accept creatures die out just not that new ones are created, "therefore man must have existed in small pockets with dinosaurs".. 




 the [difference between sun and shade in teh vaccuum of space is about 275 degrees ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasas-spacesuits-allow-astronauts-to-work-in-an-extremely-tough-environment/2011/09/12/gIQA37SsfK_story.html)

this is with no steps, this is front and back of the suit.
 




 someone more artistic than me needs to redo the reddit logo for this sub to have that haircut. 




 unfortunately just looking at the username.. i suspect not.

And i will take this time to mention that this is a systemic and wholly republican problem. And part of the divisive issues at hand.

They talk about real americans.. versus..

they are patriots .. versus..

they need to take back this country... versus...

and dems generally dont do that. We dont question peoples patriotism, besides we think patriotism is stupid. we believe in right versus wrong, not blindly supporting government actions which seems to go away as soon as their is a dem president. And we definitely dont pretend even the craziest of republicans arent "real americans" Thats not to say we can hurl some bombshells. I do al the time.. but its a bit different with the GOP as they do seem to see anyone not GOP as "not a real american".. "not a patriot" and someone "we need to take out country back" from.
 




 get what you say but when they didnt have voting rights its kinda meaningless.

yes considering blacks less of a person for purposes of representation cause the southern states to have less power.. but how about considering them 3/4th a person as far as representation but then no vote.. well in that case you are really giving the slave holders more power, per person they owned. because the slave owner was the only one with the vote.. so each white slave owner in teh south, had more power than each individual white non slave owner in the north.
 




 or i didnt have any trouble so no one else should have.

(and really everyone over 50 you can say fuck off with this..[in 1978 a summer job at min wage could pay for a year of tuition](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/politifact-the-meme-about-the-summer-of-78-and-college-tuition/2192477) they dont even know what a hill looks like much less walk up one both ways. And raising min to $10 isnt the same because some things like college rose faster than inflation)
 




 well i take some exception. While he literally wouldnt care after the fact of his death, before death, i might have some cares about my body being used after my dead to further some of these bullshit things.  Like i am an organ donor.. i will be dead and wont give a fuck at that time.. but while i am alive i think of good things being done with my discarded parts and it would disturb me to think bad things were done.. yeah its just a baptism, but it still supports and furthers their nonsense even if it wasnt my choice. 




 it is bizarre  even for the religious right, to see them trying to claim they are actually the victim.  Silence or indifference would have been a ton better than claiming.. no really it wasnt anti black it was anti christian.

thats like saying hitlers goal was to rid germany of germans.

its hard to see anyone willing with a straight face to go on the press and say these things and yet we seem to have a line of them.

i guess over the past decade or so they have learned they can say pretty much anything with impunity in the media.
 




 they [having issues atm](http://status.perk.com/)

working on it i guess. 




 [perk status](http://status.perk.com/)

dont tell you shit but

normally when shits kinda fucking retarded it will say shits ok.

right now it says shits not ok, thats why things re extra fucking retarded right now.
 




 and the multi tier justice system still exists.
 




 sorry but if wearing underwear.. even without moving it to the side, you can actually have your anus penetrated.. underwear stretches a bit.. its not an iron shield.
 




 it can be automated... something this huge would take a lot of cpu to do it, but it can be automated fairly easily. 




 after the political winds changed.  

Sorry but shes a raving opportunist.

She first tried to say we wont ever be able to explain why he did this despite his own words.

when directly asked about the flag she said the people of sc had this discussion already and i suspect we will have the discussion again... nothing about it being bad.. matter of fact she did the politician thing of avoiding giving her view on it.

it wasnt until it became an issue to have the opposite view did she come out to ask for it to be removed.

Still I will take what I can get.  Its good she is calling for it to be removed even though she is only doing so for political reasons. And sorry but thats a fact. She was leading the charge in the right winger denial machine until teh GOP started taking heat for pretending it wasnt to do with racism.
 




 luckily some of the worst of them are dying off. not wishing ill will or celebrating their deaths, just the inevitable march of the human race.

but since i am dissing my state, theres a lot of good hearted kindness down here as well. my aunt moved to a small town here and i swear pretty much the entire town stopped by over the first 3 days welcoming her there and dropping off food gifts from their farms.
 




 I'll tell my one story that bugged me. Working in a resteraunt this young man came in, rather timid looking, for some lunch. There wasnt a lot going on so i talked to him a bit. He was from a small town in nowhere sc and had never been out of it before, but he had managed to get a scholarship to usc, was put on a bus and sent to columbia and he was kinda overwhelmed by the entire place and being their alone. To him columbia was a huge intimidating city. Well some of my bosses friends came in and they were sitting at the bar and started to crack racist jokes plenty loud enough for that kid to hear. And he actually cried. I paid for his meal felt bad as fuck for the kid. and as typical my boss and his friends would always claim to not be racist in the least. my boss would normally "no one can call me a racist i hirer a bunch of them" and things like that.. sigh.

the bigot has since passed on. idk about his friends.

and if you dont know about columbias infamous racist, [maurice bessinger, its an interesting story. man gave up millions just to keep being a public asshole.](http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/HaireoftheDog/archives/2014/02/24/maurice-bessinger-bbq-baron-and-unrepentant-racist-dies)

he's also passed on, different bigot though from the first story.
 




 well see, its not even [historically accurate to the war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)

the only flags the actual confederacy used liked it, was a white banner with the modern confederate flag, similar to where we put our stars.(and yeah people thought it looked too much like a surrender flag, but they said fuck it and used it anyways)

it was the flag of northern virginia regiment and tennessee regiment.

it you look the SC confederate flag, is quite different.. the palmetto confederate flag. The only time the flag in that form came into popularity was when it was adopted by bigot groups. Thats its history in sc. Not the war.. in the war we used the [palmetto confederate flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/South_Carolina_Sovereignty-Secession_Flag.svg/440px-South_Carolina_Sovereignty-Secession_Flag.svg.png)(besides it is based on the confedderate flag it is probably the coolest one). If it was about heritage and not hate, why didnt they use that one?

now I am not saying it hasnt evolved some to mean something to some people who arent bigots. but its based on a bastardization of history.

 




 well thats not necessarily a bad thing, that was about the stupidest stache you can grow. 




 sounds like before, since they nabbed him in his truck in line to get into the event. Which makes me wonder if he will get out with a truck still full of trash. I dont really see them doing the work for him..so i suspect so. 




 that had to be a fun roller coaster for him.

"ooo cool a new miley interview"

"hey, dude with the record... omg shes talking about me!!!!!"

"FUCK"
 




 because they didnt read either.
 




 Though your comment is probably a legitimate compliment, this is the net, so i cant be sure. However I am quite sure he was being purposefully ironic, since the only uncommon word he used was the one he used to describe _leftist. And yes it is quite humerous. 
 




 Hes been spotted at a craft brewers conference, with several laptops going at once, processing multiple beer labels simultaneously. Ive never seen anyone working as hard as him, said Scott Newman-Bale, who works with Shorts Brewing Company.

idk, sounds like they found a real aspey. 




 i need to see the other side 




 i am am not sure she can say there is no tipping point..eventually you can actually get enough where it is a chore to try to spend it.. not sure how you could say that more would make you happier when you cant spend what you have.


but yeah anyways the first study never claimed that it stopped at 75 but that that was the peak of happiness gains in changes of income. that after 75k each 10k more is less changing than under 75k
 




 i agree but unfortunately i dont see it coming down this time. The legislators have already said they wont be able to take it up til december.. when many people are more concerned with holidays than politics. and due to the agreement last time.. it will take a 2/3rd majority to get it down.


nah that things staying up. By december they wont have the political will.
 




 really? 

honest question, would you find it unusual to read a story about a holocaust survivor burning his neighbors nazi flag? i mean would you think the jewish guy was mentally unstable and not of the norm of society for doing such an act?


i recall fox news getting upset at a mexican flag flying over a post office in a mostly spanish town in the us.. despite that town used to be part of mexico and it was part of their heritage(personally i agreed with fox.. it had no place flying over the post office)

and [then is this lady who stole the mexican flag from a e mexican grocery  because this is america not mexico](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/02/muslim-hating-mexican-flag-stealer-delivers-bizarre-anti-tyranny-prayer-to-the-tenn-senate/)

so i suspect people can and do get upset at symbolism especially if they think it is designed to offend them.

it might just be a flag to you, but perhaps it offends some a bit more when its presented by the government.
 




 wow there is a concerted efforts by america conservatives to discredit and downplay the pronouncements of this pope despite he follows up with action every time. Heck one guy below says the pope is the antichrist because he does good things and thats just what the antichrist would do to deceive us.   he'd much rather have a pope hate and gays and muslims and say wealth is a god given blessing and poverty is god hating you.
  




 they cover commercial sellers at gun shows. Please stop with the NRA talking points bullshit.

[Generally, gun control advocates want to extend background check requirements to private sellers at gun shows. Gun rights advocates say there is no loophole, and believe any federal law requiring background checks for sales of secondary market firearms between private citizens, whether at gun shows or not, would exceed the government's authority, be a prelude to gun registration, and endanger gun owners' Second Amendment rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_show_loophole)

HEY WE CAN HAVE THIS DEBATE, but if you want to act like a dumb ass while claiming I dont know what the fuck I am talking about then their is no fucking point.

there is a gun show here.. I can go there and buy a gun with zero background check as long as the seller is a private citizen. However i cant buy a bottle of liquor from my neighbor as a minor. ITS A LOOPHOLE.. AND YES I DO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I AM TALKING ABOUT.


here is a [FUCKING MAP of the places that allow you to buy without a background check from private sellers at gun shows](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/safety-justice/gun-show-firearms-bankground-checks-state-laws-map.html)

YOU SIR ARE A SHILL OR IGNORANT.. take your pick. .i come with sources.
 




 ahh so jesus was an antichrist.. got it.

i mean he did good things.

obviously the only way to not be the antichrist is to not give a fuck about the poor. and be as greedy as fuck.

seriously dude, you are covering the entire human spectrum with your antichrist comment. he can be pure good and then turn evil.. thats what satan does. LOL

you friends are still idiots dude.

he sounds more like jesus,, than ted cruz does.. sorry dude but its true.

 




 did he make the sword or buy investments in the sword manufacturer?? well you cant read either,.

sure good at coppying quotes from the bible, why cant you copy the quote from the title of this submission?

**you know how easy it would have been for him to include weapon owners in his quote?**

strange he didnt huh,.
 




 old testament doesnt count.. well until we say it does and then it does and when we dont want it to count it doesnt counts again. magic. 




 he said investors and manufactures, not soldiers or owners.. but hey.. its ok if you cant read.
 




 so rand paul cant denouce war because the us has made a lot of wars.

got it.

also didnt know germany was still so nazi and anti jew.. cause obviously nothing ever changes.
 




 no one said you couldnt own them.

but apparently yall cant read.
 




 anti christ? for cleaning the church of pedos, saying to help the poor, and saying we should make war less? Yall have a strange view of christianity.

and funny yall all seem to kbnow what jesus said, but yall never seem to be able to actually read WHAT TEH FUCKING POPE SAID.

he didnt say you cant own a gun.

and seriously anyone who says he is the anti christ is no christian.. they might disagree with teh dude, but come the fuck on.. he said help the poor, and has brougth pedos to court, cleanign up the church.. he has slapped down teh super rich bishops.. hes actually doing shit to help people.

people who say he is the anti christ sound like some evil ass motherfuckers.
 




 well except he is actually putting his money where his mouth is.
people keep screaming pr when he opens his mouth and then he goes and does something like set up a pedo court and start sending high level preists and those who hid them to the court.

its a bit more than PR.. is a progressive pope.
 




 what weapon war?

but yes christians in the past and today are hypocrits.. wahts the point? do you disagree with his pronouncement? 




 no they are not.. that was an internet lie.

beretta is solely family owned, and believe it or not people buy enough guns they have never needed investors. fucking crazy i know.
 




 and he didnt say dont own a gun. Some of you conservatives have a hard time reading.

did you make that sword? did you help the sword maker find money to open his shop? no? he wasnt talking to you.

NO WHERE DID HE SAY YOU CANT OWN A GUN.

if he did he would say "who manufacture weapons or invest in weapons industries AND GUN OWNERS are hypocrites if they call themselves Christian"

nice failure with the bible verse.. maybe if it had something to do with what he actually said.
 




 you have a source that it was illegal by the catholic church for catholics to not invest into weapons manufacturers before this? this is the first i am hearing about this and I really would like to read it.


either way, you do know the church still says shit like "gay marriage is bad" I'm quite sure most of the religious know how the church feels.. so why do they still repeat it? 




 Why? Ok so you are going to comflate the pedo thing with the gun thing?

or are you talking about reparations for a war before most peoples births?

sorry but I disagree. This pope speaks, people like you come every single time and say bullshit and every single time he proves yall wrong by actually doing something about what he said he was going to.

I guess you mean the catholic church needs to return the shit it got from the musollini during wwii.. or he is a hypocrite. cause musollini used guns?

if rand paul is elected president, can he no longer complain about war? I mean america has a bit of a history with war? maybe we need to give recompense to every nation we ever .... um freed against theri will.. before we let rand denounce war.. cause you know america has a history.

I agree with you, we need the debate about the ILL GOTTEN GAINS of the church. 10000% you are fucking correct.

But him being a hypocrit until he fixes everything we perceive wrong with the church before he is allowed to speak? nah thats just crazy talk.


 




 he did.

he even has made drastic changes to the church to stop that.

I dont get why so many of yall are ignorant about this.

It was like a year of posts on reddit.

1. [he admitted the church had pedos at the highest level.](http://www.religionnews.com/2014/07/14/pope-francis-raises-eyebrows-saying-pedophile-priests-include-bishops-cardinals/)

2. [he is trying to end celebecy DUE TO PEDOS.. he thinks it will help.](http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=59123)

3. [he set up a special court to bust the church pedos](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/10/pope-creates-tribunal-to-hear-cases-bishops-who-fail-to-protect-kids-from/) and THOSE WHO HIDE THEM. says [ZERO TOLERANCE IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pope-francis-calls-u-s-churches-stupid-article-1.1295178)


the church is full of pedos and YES THIS POPE.. that yall keep trying to find gotchas to.. is actually and IN REALITY.. trying to fix that. This was pretty much his day one shit dude. It was realy his first pronouncements as pope. It what got people talking about him in the first place.
 




 we could ask, but i suspect it would depend on the situation.

and then their is the whole render onto caeser thing.. where he might realize that they dont have much of a choice and that the government cant force you into sin.
 




 you mean the fake berreta story? cause you know it was fake? they dont have holdings into berreta.
 
but so far this pope has put his money where his mouth is.. people said the same thing when he came out and admitted the church was chock full of pedophiles at the Highest level. People on reddit said .. yeah sure thats good and all(it was a fucking amazing first step fucking admitting it) but where is the action.... and then he set up a court to start trying them fuckers and restructured the church to stop shipping them off to the infamous pedo churches and such.

believe it or not this pope seems to be the real deal. I still dont agree with everything about him, but i like what he is trying to do and he is ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IT. its not just feeding people what they want to hear.

and I'm a total atheist, so i have no pro catholic bias here.


 




 This is our problems with right wingers like yourself.

WE say.. "hey it might be a good idea if those background checks also cover gun shows.. seems like a huge hole to us"

you come back "LIBERALS WANT TO TAKE MY GUNS AWAY"

no one said that.

The pope didnt ask you to get rid of your gun.

did you make it yourself? NOPE.. he wasnt talking to you.

do you sell guns? NOPE he wasnt talking to you.

do you invest in the makers of guns? nope he wasnt talking to you.. and no just buyign a gun isnt an investment into the makers not by how he is using the term.
 




 you hunt deer with a hand gun?


then you shouldn't be called a "hypocrite" no matter what religion you go by.

I dont make the rules for catholics, and he doesnt make the rules for all christians BUT HE DOES MAKE THE RULES FOR CATHOLICS.. so if you happen to be one, I suggest you either accept it or become something else.  Its hypocritical in his eyes for catholics. TO INVEST IN MANUFACTORS OR BE A MANUFACTURER of guns. Which neither you claim to be. so Even if you are a catholic, it sounds like you are ok.

you should read what he says and not claim he says something else. 

**Absolutely no where did he said you cant own a gun as a catholic.**
 




 nope.. total horseshit.

its a totally family owned business.

They really have never needed investors.
 




 well except them rich liberals.. raised min wage, gave us the consumer financial protection agency and while it isnt single payer, they gave us much needed health reform which the right is dead set against and slowly but surely liberals have been forcing state governments to stop arresting its citizens for smoking a dead plant.

and liberals a little bit less gun hoe about sending boobs on the ground to fight stupid wars.

but other than that your right, they are exactly the same.

PS a third party is idiotic, until we fix the very thing that causes them to not be function. see DUVERGERS LAW and the problem with first past the post voting. Oh we might successfully vote in a new liberal party or a new conservative party and in 4 years it will look like the old one. See duverger.
 




 sorry that was found out to be complete horseshit.

[bereta is soly family owned by the beretta family..](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Beretta) wikipedia

you will notice you wont find your info anywhere besides non mainstream sites, they all use the same source, which no longer exists.


i dont doubt there is shit in their investments we can attack.. this isnt one. 




 not more than catholics. But yeah we like the new pope, hes better than the old pope. but you do know the republicans would be quoting him to high heaven if he said wealth is a sign of blessing from god, or that muslims must be stopped from getting a nuke.


edit; downvote but no debate.. you dont think catholics follow this pope as much as reddit? or do you disagree that republicans would have less of a problem with him if he spewed republican talking points?
 




 Romney was probably [the only republican calling for it to be removed back in 2012](http://www.mediaite.com/online/mitt-romney-denounced-flying-of-confederate-flag-while-gingrich-defends-it/). i give him extra points, despite being an obama voter, because he took this stand in the face of his party and their was no shootings going on at the time.

its something the GOP get asked about every election. its just not as big of news outside of sc. 




 bulls dont get asked before we take their semen..

cows dont get asked before we artificially inseminate them.

I get one is done from a clinical mindset and one is sexual mindset.

but what if the farmer enjoys it? How do we word the law?
 




 well thats what the article suggests.. that all she did was get on her knees 




 Well people arent all the same, have the same views or cultures. And frankly, even you have admitted you cant successfully argue why it is wrong, though you blame a lack of coffee. The people you are talking to.. they dont think its right, they just demand a coherent argument on why it is wrong to justify the laws. laws shouldnt be made on feelings. 




 before he died for your burger... he had a different life.

[fisting cows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-MhCmOJo-A)

[collecting bull semen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWS-61ZI8g4) warning a bit sexual.

and the second part.. [putting it in another cow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yvXowLh-Pg)

the cow did more than just die for your burger.

and for an unrelated bonus.

fear factor .. [the donkey semen episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6KiP7iQgo)




 




 no he related it to something that would be considered a sexual act under other contexts.

he also missed that prized bulls tend to get hand jacked off to see off the seman..  The question posed to you, is what is the difference and can you make a legal description of the difference between a girl jacking off a dog, and a farmer jacking off a cow.

its a fair question

 




 can you jack off a horse?

perhaps it isnt coffee thats failing you?

and no one said it was right, just that perhaps it shouldnt be illegal. The two concepts arent synonymous. I dont think it is RIGHT what Westboro baptist is doing, but i dont think it should be illegal.

see?
 




 while that might happen in those cultures, it didnt happen in this one as the state of the media was in decline long before the net became popular.
 




 idk, [does that turret only shoot defensive bullets?](http://boingboing.net/2008/09/02/south-carolina-sheri.html)

I know i know i will look so foolish when the russians invade columbia sc.
 




 yeah thats the point.. there were restrictions added.

But try to close the private show loophole or reinstate the assault weapons ban and they pretend you are hitler. 




 I'm glad i am not the only one.. i used to think i must have really strangely shaped ears. now I just think their is a conspiracy and everyone else glues theirs in.

I finally got some with different size ear things.. i thought FINALLY.. but naw they all fall out, unless i am totally motionless and in the vacuum of space.

did the rest of yall evolve like little ear fingers to hold onto them things? I mean i read on questionable sites that people actually jog wearing earbuds. This is totally implausible.

I may try some of your ideas, but i'm not really sure yall all dont work for the secret anti-headphone consortium, trying to ruin peoples experience with headphones by flooding the markets with these earbud things and giving everyone a bad experience making them go back to stand alone speakers.

 




 I'm not sure "fool" is the perfect word here. Luxury doesnt have to mean quality, it can simply mean something others cant afford. Case in point, the people who bought that $1000 iphone app which put a crystal on the display. No one was fooled. No one thought it was coded by stephen hawkings. No one thought eh crystal graphic was designed by banksey... so why did people buy it? because most people couldnt afford it.

fooling people is when they say those special hdmi cables play audio better and crap. Those people are being lied to.

 




 its a lot easier when you are in slow motion like that. 




  Have we had a conversation to know why people respect this icon enough to have it displayed so prominently?

we can but they wouldnt like it. It has exactly zero history with SC besides the klan and put up for opposition in civil rights era. 

might have a point if we used the sc confederate flag and put it up like say 200 years after fort sumter.. but no.. it was put up to protest integration. It was 100% put up there for racist reasons. Anyone who invokes heritage is lying.


here is the wiki on the confederate flags of america.. notice there is no THE CONFEDERATE flag...and not once did the confederacy actually have that as a flag. 2 regiments had that particular flag as the flag.. yes it was part of the design of the confederate flag.. but it wasnt the flag. So historically they arent even being accurate.


bigotly, they are. 




 you sure get riled for someone with no opinion.. who dont care if it stay or go. You say it will have no effect and yet people here are obviously offended by it. So you should have no problem... that is if you really dont care either way. I sure  wouldnt. And normally when i dont care either way..  i dont even say anything because.. i dont care.

I'm sorry if you can grasp that state sponsored racism my effect society. But hey symbols have zero power so lets put the nazi flag up in jewish areas all over the world.. they cant be offended cause its just a symbol

**PS when the bigots lost SA.. they took down the flag.** 




 so you would be ok with a region of germany putting up the nazi flag after a group of jews moves in for "history and heritage"


got it.

this from the same groups of people who actually punch salvation army volunteers for saying happy holidays to them

how is it yall seem to get offended at the smallest things like people wishing you well, but cant seem to understand that people can be offended by a flag that has been used by bigots and hate groups for 100 yearss?
 




  No group of white people thinks its okay to go into a troubled northern black community and try to convince them that maybe they're doing something wrong to produce a generation of kids who idolize the thug life.


really? turn on fox, tell me how many times they mention the thug life in chicago a day.


like Christians have done with the WBC

they really havent.. not from a christian perspective.. most of the protestors have come from people like the hells angels.


 




 I asked my Dad (history buff) why they keep the flag on capital grounds. He summarizes and tells me that's it's a reminder of our past. That we once held a belief and fought for it. And blood was shed to defend our lifestyle.

your dad, needs to work on his history.

First that flag was never a flag of the confederacy.. it was the flag of only two regiments one in va and one in tenn. 

now the [palmetto confederate flag does have some history in SC but we didnt use that one.. we used the one that was NEVER ADOPTED BY THE CONFEDERACY.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)

now yes most flags of the confederacy did incorporate the design into their flags but IT IS NOT A FLAG OF THE CONFEDERACY.

So it was mainly used by 2 regiments.. and nothing big of famous about them. IT got wide spread use by the klan and other hate groups after the civil war. THATS THE ONLY HISTORY SC HAS WITH THAT FLAG.

it wasnt part of the confederacy.

Now.. when did we embrace this history? When the federal government told the south they had to desegregate in the 1950s.. and the south decided to threaten civil war by putting that flag up all over the south.. 

It wasnt put up for history or heritage.

it was put up for bigotry.

SC has no history or heritage with that flag

the confederacy doesnt really have a history with that flag.. it is a small part of the design

the only places that do besides va and tenn is the klan.

So i respectfully ask your dad to rebuff his history.


it is was about heritage we would have had the palmetto confederate flag out there, but it wasnt, its about bigotry, which is why it was put up during the civil rights era and also why we couldnt make mlk a holiday without making confederate day a holiday, as if the two things have anything to do with each other besides race.



 




 freaken amazing all the terrain that walls goes over.. and this was all built without massive trucks hauling all that material to people. 




 wow he is correct.

but perhaps it isnt 'screw you over and limit"

but good knowledge of their equipment and once you reach about 20 devices people would start having problems.

And the problem with this, is people often blame the wrong thing. Like if theri phone is dropping net.. they might say "this google internet is complete shit.. web sites keep timing out"

when it isnt the net, they just have overloaded the cheap router google gives out with theri fiber.

so they arent trying to be dicks, they are sorta trying to be like apple. They are protecting users from themselves.

ahh from google.. yeah this sounds like what it is.

The Network Box supports a maximum of 16 wireless devices. As the number of connected devices approaches 16, however, performance degrades dramatically.

after 16 the router is probably complete shit.. like some people experience here in perk with 15 phones. 




 most crashes, freezes seem to be server side.

with the ups and downs of perk, its kinda impossible to make proclamations or find things like this without real scientific testing and not "i feel" or "yesterday my phones crashed and today they didnt"

not picking but its too variable.. you need to do longer tests. And your hypothesis is missing a why this might work.

i suspect there were other reasons for your successes.

not trying to be a jerk or come down on you, but the entire /r/beermoney network is full of BS and sudo science and well it gets tiring weeding through the snake oils to find reality.(not that random fixes is as bad as ..dont watch app videos only.. or you will get banned.. always redeam your bing from a different ip than you searched.. and other totally 100% bs things that actually make it in the faqs and crap) 




 at most it should help bootspeed.

thats it. 




 well i wonder if that part has more to do with people who have an entire farm and never touch the computers.. versus most of us who do this on our own computer.. not sure if you have to actually interact with the site.

bear with me.. see if it was for ALL OF US.. to make it really not passive.. all they need is a 'are you still watching" pop up. Its kinda easy. The fact they are going to do this by behaviors suggests they arent trying to stop all of us, just the mega abusers. I could be wrong but thats how i read it.
 




 well not sure about that.. most beermoney things start off a bit loose on the rules and with high payouts.. they have to get a critical mass of users as quick as possible so they can charge big bucks for ads.

every single one will slowly tighten the rules and slowly reduce payouts to a point where they hope to balance concerns of advertisers and keeping users. 




 certain areas  isnt the same word as certainty.. but I suspect you knew that but didnt want to respond to the guys actual comment. WEll that or you arent familiar enough with english to comment on the topic.

anyways certain areas are having a bad time in LA right now

[Los Angeles Will Literally Take Your Car Away If You Don't Drive It Every Three Days](http://la.curbed.com/archives/2015/03/los_angeles_72_hour_parking_towing.php)

maybe OP knows some of these people.

And you know different people do different things and go different places at different times and might have a different experience than you.. CRAZY I KNOW.

but like it or not, people do get towed in LA and you cant say OP doesnt know people who have been towed once a year.

[Bill to Protect Motorists From Predatory Towing Clears House](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/10/local/me-predatory10)

AND THAT I AM CERTAIN. 

and please take the time to read the comments to the articles i linked, these are LA residents that disagree with you. no they arent calling you a liar, they just have a different experience with being towed than you do.
 




 well this is the net.. so.. askign why people lie is a bit silly.

And no one accused you of lying.

I simply asked a question.

as for "i suspect you dont live in these areas" (You know it can be different for someone who lives in an area versus someone that visits?)

I mean I suspect you dont live in the areas you say are known to be hard to park in. You didnt claim to, so you cant claim i am calling you a liar. tell me, have you lived in every single district in LA? So some you havent lived in huh? The people there might have a different experience than you?
 




 once a year might be a bit high.. but you scoff a bit much as if he just said the earth was only 6000 years old. And then you even admit there are certain areas that are incredibly difficult to park.. i suspect you dont actually live in these areas.
 




 You left off some key info.

whats your PSU.
 




 he doesnt have to point at israel. States with regs have less murders than those with weak regs. And have lower suicide rates.

[Conn did major regs recently closing the gun show loophole and others and saw murder rate drop by 40%.. ](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/12/us/gun-law-homicide-drop/)



Missouri  did the opposite.. [they got rid of background checks for guns... and saw a 25% increase in murders](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/02/13/1589161/study-gun-homicides-increased-25-percent-after-missouri-background-check-laws-repeal/)

and to the bigots, no Conn did not ship its blacks to missouri.

and yes crime stats show blacks commit more crimes.. and while whites kill more whites than blacks kill whites, blacks lead the stats per capita.. and when you compare income levels. BLACKS STILL LEAD.. wow.. must mean blacks are predispositioned to violence huh? we got rid of ALL THE VARIABLES.. didnt we? well except racism and telling someone they are shit and less of a human for their entire lives might actually increase crime rates. When similar people are doing similar things but the cops all jump on the black guy.. well hes going to grow up thinking hes damned if he does and damned if he doesnt.. and this might cause the disparity in numbers. SO please dont link me that totally misused stats.

and if you still dont get it.. [watch the clark experiment. Sorry this kids are going to grow up thinking black people are inferior and thats going to cause an increase in crime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpUyB2xgTM) when you are taught at that young age that you are ugly, and bad... well try doing the same with a dog and see what type of dog you get when your done.



 




 dylann they let you post from jail? wow man. Times change.
 




 u from LA? what part? same to huicho.. 

edit: just a question, dude was attacking OP as if Op didnt know what he was talking about. LA is a big place. I have had my car towed there. I was just inquiring to see if their might be differences due to where they live.. Never heard of that reddit? 




 ahh the man with all the answers. We have been looking for you.
So how many and how often?

one  a day? one an hour? What will keep me from getting banned, and what is your position at the earnhoney empire?

Sorry dude, while you may be right, being snarky when you dont actually know for sure and have zero sources to share, isnt the brightest of ideas.

 




 it really goes hard against intuition. They really should train this more to people when they first get a DL. The first instinct is to hit the brakes, the second is to hit them harder.
 




 Its a little known fact that teh guy who invented scissors did so to get a pair of scissors out of the packaging. 




 well hopefully they will learn how stupidly offensive it is and how it was never the actual flag of the confederacy and only gained real popularity after the klan and other bigot groups started to use it and then was put up all over the south during the civil rights era.

its only true history, besides being on the dukes of hazards is bigotry. well that and it was the regiment flag of virgina and tenn.. the SC flag was the palmetto confederate flag which would have been more appropriate even though i still disagree with that one.

you know they are still in major use today right?

Go to your local hospital.. you will find pagers.

doctors are the main people who use them to this day.

Data breaches put patient information at risk. For example, 90% of US hospitals experienced a data breach in 2012 and 75% of hospitals are not sufficiently securing devices with patient data. Dealing with these HIPAA violations is very expensive.


and their batts last forever.

 




 CB... i used to love that. AS a kid it was amazing... as an adult, its a bit creepy thinking of my 10 year old self talking to random truckers arround the states

breaker 1-9 




 I remember when [phone numbers had letters.. and you picked up the phone and their was an operator on the line](http://mentalfloss.com/article/61116/why-did-old-phone-numbers-start-letters). My grands number was like isl3639
 




 the only solution

well there, you just stepped in it. Sorry anyone who says there is only one solution to just about anything is wrong.

one notice the article is about america and yet a lot of democracies dont have the same problem. INTERESTING.

so i guess we are a special species of human with such unique genes that we are predisposed to this nature where other people in other countries arent?

WE can culturally push back against the anti intellectual ravings of the right. How they spit out that being educated it elitist. Where they have a high school drop out edit the world of a doctorate to tone down the warnings on AGW.. and really we got to do something about the anti science folks who keep gettign americans killed by screaming "liberals only want lead out of gas to help catalyitic converter donors.. its not bad for you".. "liberals just want to control people, cigs arent addictive and tobacco doesn't cause cancer"... "there is no way cfcs could cause the ozone hole, tis a natural thing and man doesnt have that power".. "so2 isnt a problem and cap and trade of it will destroy all of society"(if you look when we did cap and trade so2, not only was it cheaper than the most optimistic view but more effective as well)

sorry man, but their is no ONLY Solution.. we can pull back from this VERY MODERN anti intellectualism from the right, without going to a scientific oligarchy. (they werent always like this, nor as fascist, just go back to nixons day.. its the birchers and the radically religious that took over the party since then.. that is the problem.. they need anti intellectualism because neither sides ideas are supported by science)
 




 Just say what it is.. the right wing is radicalizing.. mainly as a means of staying alive as some of their ideas fall out of favor.

its the same reason they went after the bigot vote in the first place. Progressives are populous, its why they dont have to play these games. Where the right has to win votes. 




 yeah no one is going to seize money from bill gates even if he is driving with a pile of cash. The forfeiture laws are extremely class orientated.  




 [http://perk.com/code](http://perk.com/code)

you [need the perk extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perk-for-chrome/edpaeddemekchnbmjmcjplbbeeheionp?hl=en-US)

i use simple [extension manager to turn it on and off as needd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simpleextmanager/kniehgiejgnnpgojkdhhjbgbllnfkfdk?hl=en-US)

code only lasts so many people, so if it dont work, its already been used up.

 




 one thing to keep in mind.

every single last one of these is going to have the crappiest CS on the planet.... for us. See we cost money. Yeah we make money.. but money goes from their hands to ours. They dont want to help you. The person running this doesnt know shit. Just the basics and a couple things he/she can read on the computer

on the other side, they are going to have theri best and brightest people. You want to give them money for an ad... send them an email, you might get a human calling you back, ready to answer all your questions. They will know absolutely everything about the service. CS will be stellar.

It doesnt mean they are going out of business when they seem totally retarded dealing with.. people they pay. Its quite standard. Because their most retarded employees are assigned to this side of cs.
 




 and not a single solitary republican vote.

REMIND ME WHY RAND PAUL IS A REPUBLICAN? but always runs on the liberal side of libertarian? legal drugs, no boots on the ground all over the planet, no spying against the TPP

and yet he lives with the party that is wholly anti legalization, will put boots on the ground at the slightest whim.. went against the dems and supported obama in both the patriot act and the TPP.

its almost like he only cares about right winger libertarianism or uber republicanism.... low taxes, and less regulations.


Just remember people the small gov conservatives, want you to go to jail for doing something recreationally to yourself that has never been shown to kill a single human.
 




 dude you can smoke up in your own home.. they can smell the shit from your front porch and cant get a warrant to come in now.

YEAH NOTHINGS CHANGED FOLKS.


the articles a bit click baity

but as long as you arent in public YOU CAN POSSESS IT.

and even if they can SMELL IT.. they cant break into your home now.

IT is also only a ticketable offense, if you smoke in public.
 




 well thats kinda the point.. if you decide "hey they loosening up lets go to the park where all the families are and smoke out at the picnic tables".. and have a big bag sitting on the table. He can come by and take it.


its also still illegal, so they can still use the same probable causes they have always used. I SMELT IT AND DIDNT DEALT IT.
 




 you can really tell the youngin.... er less experienced comments in this thread.

OMG the cops are going to steal weed now.

REALLY? WOW.. whats next they going to steal your money? 




 so you would rather go to jail when the cop finds your weed. HMMMMM

are you serious.

Before: cop smells weed, finds weed, busts everyone in the car. The guy busted will probably lose his job, if he is a visitor, he can stay in jail for months before trial because they dont know you well enough to let you out. And you can lose college scholarships and grants.

now: cop smells weed, finds weed, takes weed, yall continue on to your concert you were heading to.

you say it sucks worse now.

MMMMMMMMM ok
 




 sorta,... only.. ONLY because it can be confiscated.
you wont get a ticket.. which in most decriminalized  areas thats what it means it went from a criminal offense to a civil one.

 




 are you talking of perktv? 

cause i have never seen a video on the perk unlock and win.. just static ads,
 




 lock unlock lock unlock.

u cna get an app that [puts a lock button on your screen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.katecca.screenofflock hl=en).. and then go down the line, tap tap tap tap tap.. and back swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe. repeat until your fingers break.

totaly hope this helps 




 sure it is a real thing, but dont think he was fueled at all by governmetn sponsored bigotry drapped in a lie called heritage?

come the fuck on they put it up in response to the civil rights movement.

it was a THINLY VEILED THREAT

much like when right wingers showed up with guns to heathcare debates wearing shirts about watering the tree of liberty when the healthcare debates included no measures to limit the second. IT WAS A THINLY VEILED THREAT. Its impossible to deny, when you know the history of the flag at our statehouse. It was put up for purely 1000% bigoted reasons and nothign to do with history. 

AND EVEN, if you buy the lie it has to do with history, it is the ENEMY FLAG TO THE US. It has no business flying. How would you like mexican flags flying in certain texas towns? Oh wait they do and right wingers flipped.. as they should. Its not mexico, its america, no matter what it used to be. WEll this isnt the confederacy, its south carolina of THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

 




 hes side stepping the issue because he wants the debate to be about something else. Both these guys damn well know why that flag is there.. why we didnt get mlk day until we got confederate day. They know it is the flag of the enemy and no other nation would let them fly it. And they know they put it up not due to heritage but due to hate. They know this, they just would rather talk about something else.
 




 the flag of our enemy.

do you think german towns shoudl still fly the nazi flag for heritage sake?

how about east germany still flying russian flags?

 




 here is the witchdoctor aisle... 


and whats bad, that would still probably be more effective than the homeopath aisle.
 




 yeah it will work but looks like you are using up all your sata ports. 
if you have an sata dvd/cd burner w/e then you will be short one.

wouldnt get those drives though.

you can get a twice as large, just as good(but faster due to size) ssd for about the same price.

and you can get a good 3tb hdd, for about the same price as that 2tb

I would check out /r/buildapcsales

 




 comcasts sells your data as well.

[both ranked equal on privacy](https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015)

google in my book gets a slight bonus about comcast in that you can SEE all the data they collect on you... and delete. Something comcast doesnt offer yet.

the court misruled and bet the anon will win out.

in order for something to be defamatory, a court must fine that a REASONABLE PERSON would assume it is true.

this is the net.. if a reasonable person still ASSUMES a sourceless anonymous comment is true, there is a problem with that reasonable person.

 




   I honestly think this practice should be illegal, but I can understand it to a point.

nah you were right on the first half.

this is one of the many flaws with the "freemarket". Yeah you cant have 100 cable companies, phone companies laying cable.. so you need regulations that say the infrastructure and boxes and things have to be open to competition at a FAIR and reasonable rate.

Much like they already are required to do with over the air.
 




 and verizon telling customers they have zero plans to ever bring it to them...

nah sorry doesnt fly.

also they are blaming unions..

seems like verizon has a lot of excuses on why they cant do it.

 




 actually NYC does.

they are nearly their own country.
 




 by far most people who practice abstinence dont do so willingly.
 









 Yeah we get it, some white dude killed a bunch of black dudes, so we got to dilute that by bringing up stats and suspect interpretations of them.

Want a stronger correlation than race? sex. Men are EXPONENTIALLY more likely to be violent than women. WHy isnt that talked about as much as race. I mean if you want to pigeon hole the killers into neat little boxes for discussion by far the one, most fit in, is the MALE box.


problems with some interpretations and suggestions.

asians are more likely to have immigrated from far far way.. even if it was the parents or grandparents.. this suggests they had some economic or job opportunities. And looking at the h1b1, and how many come from asia versus africa, this seems true. SEEMS.

Where blacks are more likely descendants of slaves.

little different starting points in this race huh?

also as for race beating out poverty. So the author kinda suggests that race is the deciding factor. This is a bit low effort. There is differences in poverty and impoverished living. LIke the same poor black, versus poor white guy, the black guy is [MORE LIKELY TO GET SHOT WHILE UNARMED](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis), in dealing with cops. Both criminals.. both interacting with cops with blacks more likely to get shot. Now you can say but they are also more likely to give trouble.. but since both those concepts feed on each other.. blacks getting shot might make them more afraid to get caught and more likely to fight getting caught.. etc

then while both can be poor their can be differences in opportunity to not be poor.

and there can be differences in how you are treated as a poor person.. which is definitely on display with the police.

just saying you cant dismiss poverty as the overriding factor just because the correlation isnt as strong, when you ignore other aspects of life that can actually raise that correlation. Meaning poverty combined with racial treatment might correlate even higher than simple race.


 nice graphs though.




 




 sorry thats just a bullshit stat cause every race is like that.. its promoted that way to try to dillute the very real issue.

Another stat you cant sweep under the rug so easily.. blacks 

[Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis)

FBI stats that show [Most whites are killed by whites and most blacks are killed by blacks](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2013.xls)

hey but if we want to pigeon hole the MOST killers.. Race isnt best, sex is.. MOST KILLERS ARE MEN.

[we can also divide it up in different ways](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/14/nine-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-the-united-states/)

the south is the most violent region in the US, most murders are southern.

Places with gun restrictions have less homicides than places that dont.


**Anyways while your stat is correct, it is misleading at the very least, when you fail to note it is the same for white people.**

and is mostly used by bigots to justify those in power and authority killing unarmed black people, because black people dont protest murderers as if that is the same.
(PS white people treat their perceived authority failures the same way as blacks and treat their criminals the same way as blacks.. they protest the former and just cry about the later) 




 hate the title..anyways

 But it also makes sense that the name would be Googled before it was tweeted; news organizations that had the name in-hand would want to do initial searches to validate the likelihood of his being the shooter before releasing the name publicly.

basically reporters getting the info from the cops immediately went to google. So before it was even reported.. google trends had his name trending.


kinda cool if you could harness this power and report things before they are actually reported.(ok i just broke my brain writing that sentence.) 









 Heritage? horseshit.. so was slavery.

If it was only heritage, the right wouldnt have held martin luther day hostage  until we make a confederate day.. what does a black mans birthday have to do with the heritage of the civil war? unless you just want to show your a bunch of bigots?

No other nation would let the losing aggressors, keep their battle flag flying in theri country, even incorporating it as part of their flag

I think right wingers could grasp if, if areas in germany adopted the nazi flag and complained it isnt bigotry, its heritage.

but some how they are completely oblivious to the hate the confederate flag brings(they arent oblivious at all, just like the southern strategy, they damn well know they are telling black people to fuck off)
 




 from /r/build a pc? thats odd.. not sure what i could have said here. 




 they are some sick fucks.

he extraordinarily referred it as a hate crime, because it was a white guy at a black church.

it is extraordinary as south carolina doesnt have hate crime laws.. cause we dont believe in them.. and please ignore the terrorists aspect of targeting a specific group.

But, Doocy continued, Bishop Jackson made a great point about the hostility towards Christians, suggesting that the attack had a religious instead of racial motivation.

well besides the comment about raping our women and taking over.. which proves it was about race... he wasnt wearing anti christian patches on his clothes.. he was wearing white supremecist crap.

The main reason they want to claim he is anti christian is they want to paint this as a problem with the left. When the right are riling up these insane people. WE have fox news day in and day out, telling the craziest and most unstable people in our country, that their insane beliefs are reality.

That obama is not a legit president.

that black people do want all your money and feel entitled to it.

and they are stealing elections through the lack of voter ID

and the only real racism today is anti white racism.


and so on and so on and so on.


it fuels the insane.

like one congressman put it.. it doesnt matter how you meant it, what matters is how the least stable person in my district takes it.

The right need to stop peddling fear and hate.

its what drives these people.
 




 I agree partially.

The pope is not saying YOU HAVE TO pass legislation.. and his report is directed at the people

the pope also isnt directly attacking any groups by name.

And thats what gets me, shouldnt the pope, wrong or right, be able to announce how he feels on global warming? legislation or not?

I have a feeling that bush would be agreeing with and maybe even touting anyone denying AGW. Does it matter if he is a pope(as far as opinion goes), or a grocery bagger.. hes allowed to have his opinion.

it strikes me as a bit hypocritical for them to say "i'm not a scientists but I dont believe in global warming and btw the pope isnt a scientists and he needs to shut the fuck up"
 




 and then they try to make religious based laws.

and bush is going to be asked every time about his comments to a catholic group about how he lead by his faith.. and actually passed legislation DUE TO HIS FAITH.


the right is in a conundrum, they NEED to attack the pope, and yet they also need to attack dems as secular and anti christian in order to rile up the evangelicals.(yeah they dont give a fuck about a pope but a lot of the republican base does)

what i really want to see the pope do is respond to the catholics attacking him and remind them of the churches teachings on the pope and maybe even threaten to excommunicate people like Bush its not UP TO BUSH to dictate what the church considers important.

(PS as far as economic policy.. bush might want to check out the stories of sodom, also when jesus threw the merchants out of the temples and the story about rendering unto caesar... NAH the church actually SINCE THE START OF CHRISTIANITY, has weighed in on economic matters and taxes)

 well considering pakistan has been sharing all its knows with everyone that can pay...

they also have allegedly built a nuke for the saudis, that is waiting on delivery. Which they did with the help of china.
 




 Well they are bullshit consumerism holidays.

Love my mom, and will honor the stupid holiday which comes days after her birthday where i honor her as well.. and I show my appreciation on xmas as well.


basically its nothing more than "buy shit day"

and soon enough we will have shoe giving day.. and give it 20 years and peopel will just think it was always tradition.
 




 so you can search out killings in other countries so that proves obama wrong. HUH.

This is the problem with republican science.

it snowed somewhere therefore global warming isnt real.


Looking at actual stats.. we have one of the [worst records for mass killings](http://www.statista.com/statistics/248845/number-of-victims-of-mass-shootings-in-western-democratic-countries/)

this isnt cherry picking a cold day and saying global warming isnt happening.

this is looking at stats.. and mass killings are more common in the US than other modern western nations.


SORRY DUDE. ITS TRUE.


 [15 of the 25 worst mass shootings in the last 50 years took place in the United States.](http://thefederalist.com/2015/06/18/actually-president-obama-mass-killings-arent-uncommon-in-other-countries/)

More than half.. and our country is 5% of the fucking planet. ASIA beats out the americas.. but individual countries, there is no competition, 
**WE ARE SO FUCKING ABOVE #2 THAT THEY CANT EVEN SEE US ANYMORE.**

It take only takes some rudimentary research to discover that rampage killers, acts of terror (as the Charleston shooting most certainly is), school attacks, spree killers are not unique to the United States.

and it only takes a very rudimentary search to show Obama was correct.


HEY DUDE.. how about stop with the knee jerk reactions to disagree with every word Obama says, cause yall just look dumb, when yall cherry pick data like that and call it science. IT ISNT.
 




 If you ask perk if your device is ok to use CS will probably say

"I'm sorry you are having problems with perk, Please try the following.

1. clear your cache.

2. reboot your phone.

3 try uninstalling the app and reinstalling."

Which of course doesnt answer your question.

Ok which phone does your android say it is?

Fairly sure that if they did answer your actual question the answer would be no.


 




 wot am i looking at?
 




 I'm more than against the crap we do around the world, but if any country on the planet needs regime change, there can be little argument on NK. Yeah i know nukes makes it untenable but damn that place is fucked up. 




 Riots generally happen to real or perceived miscarriages of justice and not to crimes no matter how heinous. And no matter the races involved.


not saying it couldnt and doesnt happen from these things, but in general, it tends to be when authority fails the community.(or is perceived to have)

prolly not the best people to copy for your business card
 




 hey everyone does that. Its the first thought of everyone who sees a poll and thinks of the population size... "NO WAY". You think of how diverse the country is and they only talk to 1060.. (most polls arround this many). I was the same way, until i took stats class and saw the math. The real key to it all.. is the random selection, it has to be as truly random as possible to make it work. because obviously if they only polled men in the south.. the numbers would be different.
 




 hes taking away a lot of teeth from them. But yeah i dont think there will be an inquisition. There could be some excommunications, depending on how badly some catholics treat the planet.

 




 This is the problem with republicans.

See its how all things liberal, every idea obama ever had, even when he adopts right winger ideas, is evil.

all because Obama said supported it.

I hated bush, but he did great things for aids in africa.. yeah he fucked up a bit with the abstinence crap.. but not all of it was abstinence and he literally helped reduce the aids rate. Now he is a republican, who does all he can to make sure our kids dont have access to condoms and birth control.. So how the fuck can I support him on his aids efforts in africa? BECAUSE I DONT FUCKING DISAGREE WITH EVERYTHING SOMEONE SAYS JUST CAUSE THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE IDEOLOGY. And almost no one do i agree with every word they say, even if they are the same ideology.

REPUBLICANS NEED TO LEARN THAT.

are their things I think are backwards as hell about this pope.. yep.

But he has made a fuck ton of progress in areas that I dont think are backwards as hell.

How to I justify supporting him in these areas?

**CAUSE I CAN FUCKING THINK FOR MYSELF.** 




 actually you are wrong.. but what ever.

He has done a shit ton.

I know yall wish he hasnt.

But he has.

he changed the way they move priests arround, pretty much shutting down the pedo underground railway..and set up a court system to punush them.. and oh yeah ACTUALLY ADMITED THE CHURCH IS FULL OF PEDOPHILES ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.

but hey.. hes done nothing.. right? all talk .. right?
 




 he told the church to quit harping on birth control.
soooooo

fox news is also anti birthcontrol and regularly promotes the idea and cheered the hobby lobby ruling.. sooooo.

 




 WEll yeah, he cant change world policy, he isnt king of the planet.
But he can AND HAS changed church policy.
I wonder why so many of yall failed to notice.
SPECIFICALLY in these areas yall are attacking him in.
 




 and helped people justify their hate and oppression.
this one will actually get more people to change their tune.
it isnt the fact that they believe that most of us give a fuck about.
fuck all kinds of people believe all kinds of crazy shit.
I dont give a flying fuck my neighbor thinks ouji boards work.

But if my neighbor got political power and started to say all policy has to come from the ouji board, well then we have a problem.

the problem with the religious isnt their beliefs, it is that they want to impose those beliefs on us.
 




 and they are wrong.

He told the church to quit obsessing on contraceptives.

made all kinds of changes to prevent the moving of pedophile priests.

and set up a tribunal to punish them and those that protected them.

And yes you can mention someones good qualities and ideas while disagreeing with others. Like I like rand pauls anti spy shit.. I dont like pretty much the rest of rand paul. I think republicans have this idea that if you disagree with a single issue that someone takes, you have to disagree with every word. 

**Either way they were wrong about the pope in this case.. so while everyone else did it.. HE ISNT.**
 




 WEll he announced they had a pedophile problem which included the upper levels of the church. and [started a tribunal to punish them and the people who protected them](https://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2015/06/16/tribunal-pope-francis-rich-barlow)

and yess he is against contraceptives, but in his climate change report coming out, he said [catholics need to harp less on abortion, gay marriage and CONTRACEPTION.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/pope-bluntly-faults-churchs-focus-on-gays-and-abortion.html?pagewanted=all)

care to rethink your comment?

 




 their margin of error is at 0.5% with that sample size.. thats pretty close to reality.
 




 Sigh. No you are not wrong, but your comment suggests you dont understand statistics. it is counterintuitive but all you need is a sample size of 1067, for a margin of error of 3% with a 95% confidence level. Its not quite this but you can read this as your 95% sure you are within 3% of reality.

and total population size DOES NOT MATTER.. we can do the same in china... yes if something is rarer than 1 in 1000  you might not pick it up.. but as long as it is a sizeable percent you are. 

Really the science of stats is sound, and while it sounds counterintuitive, AS LONG AS THE SELECTION PROCESS IS RANDOM.. and the questions arent biased, you got yourself a good poll.


btw the margin of error for this poll would be about +/-0.5% so its right on the money so to speak. 




 The Trump campaign says it used the song legally  through a licensing deal with ASCAP, the musicians' copyright group. But as Rolling Stone notes, ASCAP's rules are different for using music in a political message; they require a campaign to reach out to the song's owners.

unfortunately, [he still violated rights.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/17/415158962/neil-young-is-displeased-that-donald-trump-was-rockin-in-the-free-world)  see muscians tend to be kinda sensitive about this, so .. its in the contract. 




 whats funny is this song was actually written as a protest of republicanism, specifically a protest of h.w bush.
 




 whats bad is his base is so absolutist these days, that he actually has to say things like that after doing the right thing. 




 i wonder if att could package its grandfathered unlimited users into a sub company and then let that company go under. not advocating, just wondering what shenanigans they can get into 




 yup.

half on 2.40

half on 2.4.1

2.4 doesnt seem to crash as much but thats just a few data points and not enough to say that.

if you 2.30 guys are crashing.. i'm thinking it is perk and not the app 




 um they already have drones.

they have already showed it working.

and they are lobbying to change the laws and working with nasa to update the air traffic control system.

sorry man... you dont go through this trouble at the alpha stage.

**these things will be in flight this year if amazon has its way.**

mind you... like the google cars.. it will be in one single city to start... and then it will spread.. but this isnt bar nap ideas, this is something pretty much finished, now we need a real world city tests.

 




 you can get a similar effect from looking at objects through an index card with only a small opening allowing light through

I have done that to find my glasses that got knocked off bed side table by my cat using your index finger.. wrap it up like it would be in a fist and look through the little hole.(keep other fingers flat.. like an ok sign but shrink the o as small as it will go)

its very cool, how i can read things,  that are impossible to see without my glasses, even with some mega squints going on. 




 they sure are spending a fuck ton on this PR stunt, it would almost be better to just get an ad. They are fighting regulations and lobbying congress and working with nasa to set up a better air traffic control that could handle drones. For a practical joke, they are going the extra mile.

also you may be right, this might never work very well.. its not like tons of money have been put behind things that havent before.. segway. Either way it looks like they are serious.

and they dont have to all be 5 miles from a hub, they could rent spaces on towers and buildings for quick charge and battery swaps.. drop off the dead in the charger, pick up the new and continue 




 well i question if that happened or was an excuse.

and what they recorked it?

I think the story will change a little when we find out more/. 




 thats one of the funniest parts I think. Ostensibly, the dad is trying to entertain the kid, but the look on the kids face suggests that he has been through/survived this before and is not amused. 




 the problem is people dont understand the scale is exponential.
