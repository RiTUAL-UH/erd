 Sweet n Vicious in the Lower East Side shows games in the back patio.  




 The flow of the game changes when Dray is on the floor.  He's always at the right place at the right time. 




 Kerr is a package deal.  He's only mentioned these days b.c of his relations with Phil.  If Phil were G.M of the Warriors, I'd do in a heartbeat, bc you're getting the Triangle Offense.  Kerr by himself is not as appealing.   




 This will not go away quietly.  What does "forced to sell" actually mean?  All this while he still will get paid, fans will buy tickets and merchandise, and Clippers players will still be associated with this.   




 Feel like there's alot of "what if's"  What if Sterling appeals?  How much does California law come into play here?  Pretty sure Sterling and his team of crony lawyers was expecting this, and how to counter.   




 I cant' help but wonder how tonight's game will play out.  Of course this whole topic is bigger than basketball and life, but if Sterling receives a lifetime ban, I've got a feeling it's going to fuel the Clippers.   




 This feels sorta passive/aggressive on Doc's part.  If Sterling still remains owner after today, why not boycott immediately?  I get that he still has a job to do.  However, by principle and moral obligation, shouldn't you voice your displeasure now, and stop collecting paychecks.   




 I'm curious of all these rumors of assistant coaches not talking to Mjax for weeks at a time.  Malone was reportedly one of them, although he says his relations with Mjax are OK, and now Scal.  

 




 People are bitching b.c its not sounding the way they're used to hearing it, or the way they "want" to hear it.  And then you get a bunch of folks on Reddit that try and pick apart every little fault.   




 I think it's gonna get worse as this drags on.  These players listen to the radio, read the papers, watch ESPN, etc.  Pretty sure their friends and family have already voiced their opinion on this matter making it a  major distraction for them.  


 









 So as Redditors, is this going to be reported?   




 I know this is totally fantasy land thinking, but if Lebron wants the most rings, GS should be close to the top of the list.  He can play point, allowing Steph to be 2 guard, or play the 4 and let Bogut be the middle.  

I can't see too many other teams that could compete with that line up.  It def is a better upgrade than the current Miami squad.   




 wow internet tough guy 









 Really would like to see what a Festus and Draymond duo can do together.     




 And that is why I have full confidence in whatever our front office decides this off season with Mjax.

Also, highly recommend reading his book, "West by West" 




 Always loved Chris Henrys game, if only he stayed away from drama.   




 Spock without a doubt 




 Nyc dubs fan here.  Word is phil Jackson will be hiring Kerr, as the two of them have been in discussion for months

 Singletary 2.0 




 Staying angry and bitter takes more energy than simply letting the past go 




 Isn't this "statement" more of a formality in some ways so families can start the insurance process?   




 IMO momofuku didn't come close to hide Chan or totto.   




 I was thinking that as well, or that the terrorism job was botched so badly that the group did not want to come forth and admit responsibility 




 I'd pick up Smith simply because he would neutralize Dick Sherman.  Might be a waste of roster space, but the dude can still ball and would probably give Seattle a bunch of fits.   




 Japanese American checking in.    




 How difficult would this be for be satellites to pick up?  Surprised submarines haven't been deployed yet either?  We have the best military technology and it's hard to believe we haven't found the plane yet 









 Heard about this trend happening in NYC.  Basically run aways go to "gift" parties to get infected bc in return they get free housing and also eligible for scholarship education  




 Is u miss him, then post on the lakers subreddit.  Better yet start your own r/bazegod.   




 Quit jocking...Brandon rush was 10x the contributor, no love for him?  




 Agreed, basketball is one of the few sports where the better team wins decidedly.  A few years ago, losses like this would have been ok b.c the Dubs were so mediocre.  It's no longer acceptable.  Our roster was is better this year, but our execution was 3x better last year, esp playoffs 




 I think other teams have studied us on film and are prepared for us.   




 He shit in his own bed 




 How is it we hold the bulls to 24% shooting in the 1st quarter, and then the rest of the game they blow up?  Simple, Thibideau made adjustments, mjax didn't  




 Think he's still figuring out his role.  Barnett had a good assessment of Dre during the Pistons game.  I almost think next year he might be better of the bench where he can be 1st option. 




 What's most frustrating is that Klay doesn't drive enough.   Everyone knows he's going to pull from outside, but he seems content jacking up shot after shot.   




 Very excited to see how tonight's game is going to play out, esp with Mark Malone knowing our team so intimately.  It will be a good test for MJax to see if he can out "chess" Malone.   




 Hey check out "Internet Tough Guy" over here 




 And Pouncey himself is bi racial 




 Looks like a scene from Walking Dead 




 No love for [Bohemian?](http://www.playearth.jp/)  If you decide to check it out, don't forget to stop by the japanese butcher next door.  Hands down some of the best cuts you'll find in this city IMO.   




 The other night we were up by 10 with 2:30 to go, and he was still jacking up shots.  Why not kill some clock?   




 Pretty sure the front office is thinking the same thing.   




 Our schedule was pretty brutal compared to past years, and it hurt us especially since we missed out on home field advantage.  It's almost as if all the stars need to be aligned for us to go to the big dance, i.e no injuries, winning the division, etc.  

Remember, we also lost Cully, Ian Williams, B. Miller 




 DAE think a flea flicker would be useful early in the game to keep Seattle's defense honest?  Seattle swarms the ball so much that a little trickery would make them play off balance.  Either way, Roman has to call the game of his life today 




 Pretty sure the front office is keeping a close eye on Bogut's lack of playing time.  If this keeps up, Jackson will be on a shorter leash.  Our window to win a title is small, so all misques by coaches and players are magnified 10x.  Really wouldn't be surprised if Bogut speaks up if he is benched again for no particular reason.   









 He's had more than enough chances to prove his worth and couldn't do it.     




 Hennesey and ginger ale 




 This is a commercial regarding the respect of your elders 









 Help us out a bit more.  Was it acidic, smokey..Was there a sauce to it?  Also where do you live?  As a Californian, most of my neighbors were mostly Mexican.  During my NYC days, more Puerto Rico, and Dominican.  These little hints can help a great way.

 Not to be a sour puss, but you would think this would headline ESPN NBA news.  
 




 He didn't practice well last week, and with Cox back the coaches felt more confident with him 




 Interesting, Bowman's a lefty

As promised, noodle pic 




 No they're fucking biased 




 Dishes were as follows.  Mixed chicken salad (skin, cartilage , meat)
Beef soup, Scallops with butter, Tuna, Fried chicken cartilage, Broiled salmon collarbone, Braised pork belly, Grilled shrimp.  

 














 Noodles were some of the best ever.  Up till this point, I only liked thin (hoso-men) style noodle, but these bad boys changed my view.  They were chewy, and absorbed the soup real well.  I'll post a noodle pic later on.   




 It tasted like fish powder, but very subtle.  The broth itself had a strong fish base to it as well.  Same restaurant from Mind of Chef David Cheng episode 1 









 I never understood why they sprinkle salt on the brisket before serving you at Quinns.  The brisket I had was dry and tough 




 Damn you called it, this one was in Ueno 




 I think my phone camera settings were wacky, plus the interior was kinda dim

This particular one was by the Ueno station 




 I know it's Barnes gameplan, but these days he's been making more news  then past years.  Let's not be so quick to judge by a single comment I make of a player.   




 Matt Barnes is becoming a little bitch, always trying to scuffle and get into shit 














 There's times I listen to m Jackson, and it sounds very Singletary-esque.  Lotta cliche quotes with substance, but no real explanation.  I think the loss of mark Malone hurt us more than we thought 




 ESPN has become the TMZ of spots these days.  Just a bunch of satire, and over paid analysts to stir shit up.  Good for Merriman 




 Hardcore 49er fan that's looking for a bar in or around Shibuya this coming Sunday.  If you're a fan as well, more than welcome to join! 














 Will there be any prosecution to this?  I ask this because a similar topic was brought up in a earlier thread how drivers in the US don't get criminally prosecuted if they kill/hurt a pedestrian accidentally.  Basically, if they didn't see the pedestrian/biker, no fault.   




 this is also what i think when i'm hungover, have the flu, hungry 




 It's not your problem.  I'm pointing out that your remark regarding getting a education is not an option, it never was, and it's easy for guys like you to throw those opinions out there.  

You can spin this whatever you want, wasn't meant as an attack 




 Riiight says the guy that probably was encouraged to attend college at a early age from parents that most likely went to a 4 yr institution.  

Shit doesn't work like that in most of America, let alone NY.  You'l be lucky if either of his parents have a H.S education.  




 Toothbrushes...from a dentist.  Secret Santa  









 felt like right after his mom passed suddenly, he starting going dumb.  real dumb 




 I just called the restaurant to find out whether they had fired Dana, but the person on the other line said she could not answer my question.   




 Their Facebook page is pure [gold](https://www.facebook.com/gallopasianbistro) 




 Wondering all year why we don't go no huddle more often.  Plus, isn't the first 25 plays supposed to be scripted?   




 Still confused why Jackson didn't put bogut on Randolph from the beginning of the game.  Lee was getting torched every time  




 I for one can't wait for Ezeli to come back, but we desperately need a dependable PG.  Baze played himself out of the rotation tnt with his play.   




 I'm doing a price comparison between StubHub and NFL ticket exchange.  Felt as though StubHub prices were a little higher.  I was wondering how close to face value are the seats on NFL ticket exchange.   




 But do you think Harbaugh is willing to risk his job to be that loyal to Roman?   Things get real dicey if they start losing more games and reporters start questioning the offense.  The Ravens fired their O Coordinator mid season last year which could have totally back fired.       




 I don't get why we don't do no huddle more often.  Isn't the first 25 plays supposed to be scripted. 









 No Keane's or Minetta Tavern?   




 I have a Santoku knife that I bought from Japan that needs repair and sharpening.  It's got a small chip in the blade and I'm hoping there's an experienced craftsmen in the city that could help.   









 You guys have consistently been in the playoffs for the last decade and have a culture of winning.  This year isn't panning out, but there's a trend and it's designed by luck 




 Exactly where did I mention off field issues?  I'm referring to the article, and that contending teams would never conduct a meeting at a strip club.  You're bringing in an entirely different topic.   




 Perhaps because a lot of the players were involved and are now desperately trying to do some damage control 




 Is it no surprise that a mediocre team ala Miami has these problems? When you know going into the season you have no shot at winning the Super Bowl, how does that affect the make up of the team? Teams such as SF, Pats, Steelers are focusing on the championship, and nothing less.

Until Miami cleans up house and gets a GM that's wants to change the culture, all you're going to see is a bunch of overpaid jocks actin a fool.
