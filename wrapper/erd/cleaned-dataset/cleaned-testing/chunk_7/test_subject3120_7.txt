 My wife is Korean.  We've been married 29 years.  She still can't say "I love you".  She can say "love you", or "i love", but not all 3 words.  She said it's a Korean thing.  I had to teach her how to hug and kiss the children when they were young.  She said her father never hugged her growing up. 
























 I suspect this is an education campaign.  There's no way to enforce it.  But it sets you up, so if they catch you with out of state wood, they can fine you

 a colleague's ex wife lived there after the divorce (for about a year).  She said it's infested with druggies, drunks and old people.  avoid it if you can

If you're looking for affordable, yet not too bad, check out:

1.  Belchertown - yeah it's more pricey now than it was 10 years ago, but just a step down from Amherst.

2.  South Hadley - you can find something foreclosed look on Zillow for the latest.  It's a typical new england town full of rednecks and nimby's, but a nice place to live.

3.  Turner's Falls/Montague - yeah there's drugs up there, also poverty, but it's turning around.  Has a nice artist community and is relatively safe.

4.  Shelburne/Buckland - pretty far from everything, but if you don't care about that it's a great place to live

5.  Leeds/Williamsburg/Goshen - see what you can find for housing.  Sometimes you luck out.  Pricier than Belchertown, but close to Northampton.

Places to stay away from:

1.  Ware/Three Rivers/Palmer/Ludlow 

2.  Springfield/West Springfield

3.  Agawam/Westfield

Good luck!

 Yes you can stay for 90 days.  After that, you need to apply for a student or work visa.  You can also marry an American and apply for citizenship (usually about 7 years). 














 Wow.  What's the point of all that.  Why didn't they just send him home?  Is this about saving face? 




 Get a job, marry, have kids, grow old together, buy an RV and travel around the country, build a house out of wood from your own property, go to culinary institute, become a chef, open your own restaurant, raise four strong, confident, beautiful children, nurture them through early marriage and fall in love all over again with grandchildren...

 I play a mandola.  The stretch is not much more than a mandolin.  I can stretch to the 7th fret without too much trouble.

I own two mandolas.  One is a Hora, made in Romania.  Not very nice, about the same price as the truly mediocre Trinity College.  The other is a Big Muddy/Mid Missouri which is a little better, but not much better.  Look around on Craigslist, sometimes you can find a Gibson mandola for around $1800 or so.  I've seen them as low as $900 with some slight damage.

Another idea for you is mandocello.  Of course it's significantly different than a mandolin in every possible way, but closer to a bass. 




 I did.  I talked with her mother.  There is no father anywhere.  The family is originally from Alaska.  The mother fled the father who was abusive to a church in Florida.

 Yeah.  You know she died a few years ago?  Cancer or something.  She was a nice lady.  Used to give my grandson those little Korean yogurt drinks for free when I bought beer there.

 I was one of the first few hundred users of reddit...came here from Fark actually, I can't remember when it was, probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Anyway, I've had 5 accounts banned so far.  I'm actually surprised this one hasn't been banned yet.  It certainly is on some kind of a list, however, because I can't post to certain subreddits, and have to wait 9 minutes to post or comment in others.

So what you do is set up multiple accounts based on what your interests are.  Install a VPN like Tunnelbear and use different browsers, clear your cookies each time.

Or leave.

 Voat rhymes with Stoat and smells like Goat 




 I'm not making anything up.  I don't like your tone of voice.  I think you should leave me alone.  This is harassment. 




 I don't trust this guy, Dahboo.  He posts on GLP and 4chan and most of his videos have no documentation to support the wild claims he makes.  Pretty sure Alex Jones and Gordon Duff at least provide some evidence for THEIR wild theories. 




 Right, and as I've stated, I'm a medical professional, hence my interest in the subject matter. 





























 I think they were part of a DHS grant back in 07 or 08.  Most small departments took the money to upgrade back then. 




 It was discovered in Saudi Arabia, not in the US. 




 We all were issued a release from the CDC when the outbreak was first announced.  I don't have a pdf of it as it was printed and handed out as part of a packet of UP documents at the hospital.

Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.

if the mods are watching this thread, can you find out why I keep getting an 8 minute block on my comments in /r/korea?  I've been a member for a long time.  It's frustrating. 




 I'm an ER doctor in western Massachusetts (USA).  This outbreak was caused by someone with an attitude like yours.  This man, an elderly doctor, didn't follow universal protocols when he returned from a trip overseas, ignored his own symptoms when they began to present themselves, and was part of a system that preferred to ignore/hide a potential threat rather than treat it seriously.

Is it warranted to say that the Korean culture is largely responsible for this outbreak?  Probably not, but it certainly is a contributing factor.

 The app's permissions require that it knows your real id, can view your files and pics and access your camera, etc.

So it's not really anonymous...hq knows who you are 




 The only people infected so far were patients or visitors of the major hospitals where the vector went originally.  The problem is, it has a 10-15 day incubation period, which means most of those people could very well have already infected someone else.  I think they've quarantined most of the exposed people, but some have slipped through the cracks of course.

I suspect if you stay out of the hospitals, was your hands and don't touch anybody else you don't know, you'll be fine.

 Because we have this thing called "affirmative action" where if you are of an ethnic minority, you get preferential placement in most publicly held positions (police, fire, education, hospital, government, etc).  I don't mean to sound racist here, but that is why most of the people you see working in government offices are black women, two categories given priority over every other one.
