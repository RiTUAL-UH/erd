 Throw the horse over the fence some hay. 




 This is why crime stats in general are difficult to impossible to compare geographically: Different jurisdictions classify things different ways. I think another example is "drug-related" crime: Some places count a robbery to get drug money as drug-related, others only if drugs are actually directly involved. 




 I once saw a newspaper story about some guy facing hard times (completely forget the details), and there was a pic of him at his house with peeling paint on a window frame. I realized that I had seen lots of peeling paint in person but never in any form of mass media. It seemed so strange in that context. 




 You can find hard tacos if you try (I'm speaking only from Fort Worth experience; never been to Azle). I preferred them too, till I moved here. I'm a convert. Don't be surprised if it happens to you. 




 In FW there's a stretch of Magnolia street that has a bunch of good restaurants. There's even a vegan place that for my money has the best food in the area, and I'm not vegan. 

If you can find a taco place that makes its own tortillas, go to town. There's nothing like a fresh taco on a tortilla that's only about a minute old. (Soft tacos are the norm; I'm not even sure where you could get a crunchy taco besides Taco Bell.) 




 And when it does snow they don't plow; a two-inch snowfall can paralyze the Metroplex for a couple of days.

A friend of mine moved from Iowa to the Austin area, and on one of her first visits she saw the lane reflectors sticking out of the roads and asked if they interfered with the snowplows. Bit of a cultural change there. 




 This was on *MASH* years ago and it still cracks me up.

Knock knock.

Who's there?

Abraham Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln who?

Don't you know me?

*Another one:* 

Knock knock.

Who's there?

Thomas Jefferson.

Thomas Jefferson who?

Was Abe Lincoln just here? 




 "There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it." 




 I've heard the horse's reply as, "My alcoholism is destroying my family." 




 Yesterday I met some friends for coffee, and someone had written on the coffeehouse chalkboard, "Word of the day: Sonder." I looked it up and *sonder* is exactly what you said: The fleetingness of our minuscule presence in most others' lives.

So it's kind of cool that you came up with the same concept shortly afterward and then I read it.

Well, see you around, or probably not, actually. 




 I can whistle the usual way but not the two-fingers-in-the-mouth way. Totally perplexed how it could possibly be done. 




 I've lived in this neighborhood longer than I've lived any single place since high school, and I still can't remember the street names. I know there's a Bennett but I can't remember if it's one or two streets over.

 If you have to set something down such as a briefcase, set it on your foot or lean it on your leg. If you start to walk away without picking it up, you'll hear or feel it move and remember it. 




 Indeed; there's so much space between actual activity in baseball that they have to have tons of random stuff to say while waiting for the batter to get back in the box, or whatever. 




 "If I buy the steel wool, will she make me a Marine?" 




 The trick is to google the jokes, not just KD the image, if you want to be sure. But like they say above, everyone has to see it for the first time sometime. No big. 




 Pro tip: Cornstarch in the undies. Huge difference. 




 But how many ducks? 




 No more than 88 for Nazis -- 8th letter is H, 88 = HH, HH = Heil Hitler. 




 It took him a few seconds to remember he was also wanted in the second state, and then the third as well, so he didn't just run through them; if he had, when stepping into the fourth state he might not have tripped and fallen back into the first and gotten caught.

/very old joke 




 [Good story from the Verge.](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5074756/ryan-mchenry-ryan-gosling-wont-eat-his-cereal-cancer) 




 Thanks, Obama. 




 I just read a story where at one point the narrator gets in an elevator. "I listened to 'Sweet Caroline' on the way up and for the rest of the day." 




 "Day 32: I have successfully trained my examiner to smile and write in his notebook when I drool." 




 If someone's posting candidly and courageously to help another person out. 




 A robot is watching you poop. 




 It is now. 




 Best episode of any show ever. 




 [Here's a study](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/03/do-texting-bans-really-prevent-fatal-accidents/5104/) that found that bans like Denton's usually do nothing; in some cases they make things worse, because texters just try to hide their phones and take their eyes off the road.

The upshot is that the texting ban has to accompany a ban on all mobile-phone use or it's effectively impossible to enforce ("I wasn't texting, I was dialing!"), and the gains only last a few months without strong enforcement. 




 Somewhere there's an alternate universe where that show is still on. 




 I read that they didn't intend that as the "ending," they were going to just expand the weirdness if they got a second season. EDIT: See [this explanation from the creators](http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/26/awake-finale-kyle-killen-burning-questions/) posted downthread. 




 Weltanschauung.

Yesterday I had an opportunity to quote an old Calvin   Hobbes strip by saying, not in context, "You misspelled 'weltanschauung.'" Later in the someone said the word to me in conversation, in context. 




 *BundleOfSticks* 




 It sounds as if you want to say "The experience has made me a much better person" but you don't feel that way. It's OK, it's early in the process. Reading some of the stories in this thread, some of them sound as if the light just came on and they were cool people all of a sudden. I can assure you, it didn't happen that fast. It never does. We all have to *learn* to be good people, over the course of weeks and months and years. You feel like the Guy Who Did That Shitty Thing; eventually you'll feel like the Guy Who Grew From That Shitty Thing. It won't be tomorrow, but it will be before too long. 




 It is cool. Just not quite HitlerWasAJerk-level cool. 




 Catch of the Day! 




 I'm like this sometimes. Usually it's because (or so I tell myself, anyway) I want to not only know the fact but also understand how it came to be and what it means. 




 NO NEW MEANINGS! ONLY OLD MEANINGS! 




 Your UT Chemistry department, ladies and gentlemen. 




 Love it! 




 Computer Science isn't in the engineering college, but [Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/areas/computer-engineering) is. 




 Qatherine? 




 Like hating being tall (can't fit into airplane seats, hard to find clothes that fit, people stare at you), maybe. 




 I found it easier in Spanish because so many nouns end in -o (masc) or -a (fem); in French there are fewer cues. I remember in France hearing parents correct their kids when they learned a new word and got the gender wrong; I guess even the native speakers just learn it as they go. 




 I've visited family in Chicago and had tacos there. If you know where to go you can get good ones. 




 I would guess that if they had guaranteed reserved seats, people would re-sell them and make money with none of it going to the show itself. The lines are a hassle, but you know you're not enriching any middlemen. 




 Go. It only takes a few minutes to learn how to play, but you can go years without really feeling as if you understand what's going on. 




 Take over the world. 




 I read somewhere about a study where they put some top athletes (NFL, I think) with some little kids and had the grownups copy the kids' activities exactly, and they couldn't keep up. The kids wore them out. 




 There's no "real" difference between running and jogging; it's mainly how you see it. I don't call what I do "running" unless it's faster than 10:00/mile, but that's entirely me and applies to no one else; it's to motivate myself to get faster. 

Other folks will say jogging = recreation, running = trying to do well at races. Or (my favorite), fancy multifunction watch = running, otherwise jogging. Really, though, it doesn't matter what anyone calls it. We're all just doing what we can in the moment. 




 One reason to do long training runs is to find out which body parts chafe enough to need lube.  




 OK, best guess is you just need to keep at it and build endurance, since your pace doesn't seem to affect it much. Stick with the slower pace but try to go a bit farther this time than last time before resting, then repeat next time. Or think in terms of time instead of distance, and try to go a minute longer, etc. 




 I haven't run distance in a while, but I remember running some 5Ks and 10Ks and they were so much work, then I ran a half-marathon, and the slightly slower pace made the race seem to fly by. "Another mile marker already?" 




 And put the tape or Band-Aids on *vertically*. That way they won't come off as easily from rubbing against your shirt.
