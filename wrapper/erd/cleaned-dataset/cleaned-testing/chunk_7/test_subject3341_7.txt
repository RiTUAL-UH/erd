 They occasionally go to $50 on sale combined with the usual 30% off gets you $35. If you are very lucky they drop to $30 sale which means less that $20 after discount but they sell out quite quickly at that point. 




 I also wear a slim small in J. Crew. If you wear a Slim Small in J. Crew you are a slim small in Uniqlo. Be warned though, I found Uniqlo's fit to be far inferior to J. Crew's - so much so I returned them. YMMV.  




 J. Crew are definitely one step higher than Uniqlo's. Fit is more on par and quality is definitely higher. Just feels like a more quality piece to me. 

I usually grab my J. Crew's at around $30, so they are well worth the $10 difference to me. Whether they are $30 better is up to you.  




 Pretty sure these items at TJ Maxx and Marshall's are lower quality lines produced specifically for these stores. There are hundreds of these socks in the ones in my city. 

I think the general rule of thumb is if there's a only a few items in a single size it is a mainline, normal quality item (American Eagle and some Levi's washes come to mind); if you see a ton of an item in multiple sizes (pretty much everything else), it's a low quality item. Compare this to [mainline](http://www.divisadero.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ww-socks.jpg) [packaging](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mBPjOCzQo5_zDWe8TIl9H2A.jpg) and you can see a big difference.  




 Do a quick search for skin tone charts. It's true that there are certain colors that look best with certain skin tones, and skin tones usually correspond to race. 

I think MFA doesn't talk about this much because the colors that are recommended here (light blue, light pink, charcoal, navy blue) are colors that work pretty well on everyone. And I do think that how you wear the colors matters more than how the colors look on you. 




 Texas

Y'all 

Checks out.  




 I'll take the Armani Code! 




 I think it looks good. I would not wear it with a crew neck undershirt though. 




 I think your definition of "punchable" is based on facial features alone. And that's totally okay. 

Here's my take. I think punchability has less to do with the facial features and overall attractiveness and more to do with the attitude that is carried by the person, and therefore the face. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2e8b94/this_fucking_twat/) [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2kdn6z/i_cant_believe_this_cunt_isnt_the_top_post/) [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2atzgu/vine_star_and_little_brat_nash_grier/) [examples] (http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2hlmv3/the_doucheness_is_overwhelming/) of people that I think most people would consider attractive; however, the facial expression and attitude they carry make them extremely punchable. The phrase that is thrown around for this kind of effect is "douchey." If the pictures were of them smiling nicely (or just without the smug looks on their faces) they might be less punchable. For instance, I don't think people think [George Clooney](http://www.phootoscelebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/George-Clooney-smile.jpg) has a punchable face even though he is attractive and many people are jealous of his aesthetics. It's because he carries himself with a certain poise that makes him seem likable and kind - definitely not punchable.

I think people with unfortunate facial features sometimes makes them look like they act like a douche or have a smug attitude even though they really don't. The male you linked above is one of those faces for me, as is [this](http://i.imgur.com/YJYSstG.jpg) face. Just something about the nose and the hair makes me want to punch this kid in the face. He's not making any particular facial expression, or acting a certain way, but still, the urge is there. Most people's faces aren't the most attractive or desirable, but I don't go around all day thinking that everyone's face I see is punchable just because their nose is a little big or their eyes a little small. I know plenty of less attractive people that I would never dream of wanting to punch in the face because they are nice and pleasant to be around and look nice and pleasant too. Those girls fall into this category for me - they look pleasant to be around, not punchable. 

I'm sorry you're being downvoted for stating your opinion, OP. 
 




 We circlejerkin' but their supima cotton shirts are amazing. Got a few at $7.90 over black friday.  




 If you're worried about how they hurt your ears, just keep wearing them for a few days. Mine hurt like a bitch the first 10 hours or so but now I can wear them all day with no discomfort. 

Another alternative would be to turn them into around ears with a pair of G cushions. I have heard they are substantially more comfortable.  




 Yes. I wear 30x32 in 511s and 30x30 in 484s.  




 They will definitely stretch. If they are a tad too tight brand new they are perfect.  




 Christ I just bought these at $1.90 a pair earlier today. I mean it's less than a dollar difference... but... *frugality...* 




 I wear size 9 in Sperrys and 9.5 in athletic shoes and 8.5s are great in CDBs.  




 American Eagle jeans tend to run very large. If AE fits a little large on you I would definitely go for the 31/30, but if they fit a little tight or just right I would stay with the sizing.  




 You turn it on it's side...

 This list misses the two top recommended colognes by this poster: Acqua Di Gio and Armani Code. I have tried both and I really enjoy them. 

Most people think they are really played out, and I agree. I have definitely smelled people using Acqua Di Gio before I even knew what it was. If you go to a more fashionable college that has a lot of bros using it I would steer clear but I go to a nerd school where no one uses cologne so I thought it was a safe bet. 

[Original comment here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2iiwxb/what_cologne_should_i_buy/cl2ms6f) 




 It sounds like Macy's won't have much in terms of clothing if you are already shopping at Brooks Brothers and Barbour. I would suggest using it to buy some nice cologne or some appliances/house items. Or you could always sell it for cash at a discount.  




 Just bought a nice bottle of the stuff and was wondering how you all personally apply it.  




 Look up your skin tone online. Generally there are four main skin tones that correspond with the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), and a warm/deep and cool variation of each (occasionally a neutral). A quick Google search for determining your skin tone will get you on the right track. 

If you are Asian, I can almost guarantee that you are some variation of Winter. Whether you are warm, cool, or neutral is up to you to determine. 

Each type of skin tone will have a color palate that looks best. Again, a quick Google search of your skin tone + color palate will give you a good indication of which colors will work well for you.  




 I think they are most definitely a step higher.  




 Yes but it's Levi's. Just incredibly inconsistent sizing. 




 Wow they really do look like chinos. Just bought a pair! Thanks! 




 Same here bro. Same here.  




 Eh they're no miracle shirts but they definitely help imo.  




 It looks like you might be able to use a seam ripper to remove them. 




 I'd try something underneath. A Uniqlo heattech undershirt works great for the cold. 




 This infograph is a two roll cuff, which is very difficult to do, as the fabric that is normally around your forearm is now around your bicep. Try doing it so there's only one roll (don't pull the cuff so high in step two and then skip step three and go to step four). The roll should now be around your elbow/upper forearm, and should be much easier to do.

When I roll up my sleeves I tend to shift the entire shirt over to make the sleeve I'm rolling up longer. Then when I'm finished rolling I recenter my shirt. This way my forearms don't get in the way. Sorry if that doesn't make sense. 

Either way don't sweat it. As long as you roll up your sleeves neatly it will look good any way you do it. 




 I just recently got a pair of the heattech gloves and I love them. They are as thin as a pair of those crappy 100% acrylic gloves but they are much warmer. The plus side of them being thin is that you maintain nearly 100% dexterity for things such as fiddling with keys or checking your phone (they are touchscreen compatible). I no longer have to take off my gloves to change the song on my phone! 

If you are out in the cold for a very long time you might want something a little more substantial, but these are so thin that they would probably fit underneath a bigger glove. Definitely worth it. 




 I'll take the heathered cotton OCBD! 




 I have an Asus R9 270X I am willing to sell for $90 shipped. Negotiable. 




 I think it looks great provided the tops aren't too vibrant. Stick to soft faded and pastel colors since the white will already be very bright and vibrant. 

Off-color white shorts might be the more versatile option if you want to wear both vibrant and faded tops. 




 They are very thin but fit incredibly well and are the softest shirt I have ever worn. Great as a layering piece. 

Note that the cut varies a lot so if you aren't satisfied with the fit try another one.  




 "Unique Clothing" 




 I got my ultra light down parka today and it absolutely blew me away with how thin, light and yet warm it was. I wore it out with only a heattech undershirt and an OCBD in sub-freezing temps today and I was very comfortably warm. Definitely worth it.  




 Holy hell that is so skinny.  




 That's kind of the appeal of pullover hoodies, I'm afraid. I like the way it bunches up because it gives me a more muscular look (I'm pretty skinny). Maybe consider zip-up hoodies? I find they tend to fit straighter.  




 American Eagle is slowly moving towards simple and minimally branded items. While some of their items still have flashy logos, you can find some really nice two tones or color-blocked sweaters and shirts. 

Also, most of the brands you find recommended on here (J. Crew, H M, Uniqlo) have no branding whatsoever.  




 It's for a college class. 




 Hi everyone!

I have an assignment to interview an entrepreneur for my Intro to Entrepreneurship class. Problem is, I don't know any entrepreneurs personally, so I decided to come here for help! Below is a list of questions that form the guideline for the essay I need to write (copy and pasted directly from my assignment guidelines). 

	Idea selection  individual or team 

	How did the market and customer research effect the decision to launch?

	Describe the process of making the go/no go decision  what other alternatives were under consideration?

	How accurate was the market research?  What changes were required after launch to reorient the business or venture?

	Describe the company culture.  How did the founder set the mold for the enduring culture?  What, if anything, endangered it over time?

	How do they balance time between work, family, and personal pursuits?

	Do they remain as passionate about the product or service as when the company launched?

	Learn about the early business plans.  How useful were they in making decisions?

	Being a CEO/founder is a lonely position.  What steps have they taken to surround themselves with trusted advisors, board members, family, etc.?

	How have they financed the venture?  What lessons can they convey about financing options?

	How actively do they think about selling or exiting the venture?  Why?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Even just a short summary of your startup or venture would be awesome. 

P.S. I won't be copying down your responses word for word, I need to write an essay based or your responses, so don't worry about that. I have also looked around the IAmAs on the sidebar but the question asked there aren't really focused enough and don't really form enough of a cohesive story for what the professor wants for this assignment. 
 




 I think it makes a lot of sense to get a suit of your own right now. There are plenty of situations (applying for an internship, pledging for a frat, dates) that come up frequently enough that it is nice and convenient to have one on hand. 

That being said, I think spending a lot of money on one right now is a waste. It's not going to get a whole lot of use, even in the situations listed above, and your body will most likely still change in college (freshman 15 woooo!). Blowing a lot of money on a suit that will be worn only a handful of times before it doesn't fit anymore sucks. 

My suggestion is to buy one reasonably priced and reasonable quality suit that is extremely versatile. As said previously, there won't be a situation where navy is acceptable but charcoal isn't, and vice versa. The JCP one looks like a great choice, especially if you are patient and wait for a sale. 

I would go with a charcoal suit, but that's just, like, my opinion man. 

 




 As someone who also has broad shoulders and thin everything else, I would have some caution with Uniqlo's OCBDs. I found that even their slim fits were too billowy at the waist when I fit the shoulders right. Great quality, but their cut left a lot to be desired. 

I have found that J. Crew OCBDs fit me absolutely perfectly everywhere. If you can afford them, I would definitely consider them if you find that Uniqlo's don't fit you quite right.  




 I have the same issue, and I have found that American Eagle shirts are great. Very comfortable around the shoulders and sit perfectly at the waist. Their v-necks are my go-to shirts. 

For dress shirts, you pretty much have to tailor.
