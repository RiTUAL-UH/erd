 Aside from everything else mentioned here, you'd find it extremely difficult to prepare a launch in secret, and there is a large body of [space law](http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/space-law) that would preclude such a mission being allowed to progress to launch phase. 




 He did say in the Foreword:

The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still building suburban railways.  Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important.  I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.

 Well I guess it comes down to where we define boundaries in a world of spectrums. Which seems somewhat arbitrary. Lions and tigers can produce viable offspring, and you know the others. There seems to be similar issues between the categorisation and cllassification of anmals and planets. We grow up with a black and white understanding, but it's all really rather grey. Maybe it's a a peculiarity of human nature to prefer things to sit in separate buckets when generally the lines are much more blurred than we're comfortable with. I want Brontosauruses and Pluto! Maybe I'm human..

 Well there's this:

But in a win for iiNet and the other Australian ISPs, Justice Perram ordered that any letters sent to alleged illicit pirates must first be seen by him. He said this would "prevent speculative invoicing", which under Australian may not be lawful. ([source](http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/dallas-buyers-club-slays-iinet-in-landmark-piracy-case-20150407-1mey38.html))


Here's what one law firm has to say about it ([link here](http://www.iplawwatch.com/2014/11/downloaded-dallas-buyers-club-the-bill-is-in-the-mail/)):

"While speculative invoicing or pay-now-or-else letters are common in the United States, it has rarely been seen in Australia.

Such letters are often pro forma documents that rely on foreign copyright principles and possibly mischaracterise rights and remedies available under Australian law. For example, some speculative invoicing letters we have encountered commonly demand payment of an unauthorised use licence fee far in excess of the licence fee that would have been payable had the content been reproduced lawfully. Under Australian copyright law, damages for infringement are compensatory and not punitive in nature. In the context of unauthorised reproduction of a film, damages are likely to be calculated by reference to lost royalty the copyright owner would have received for the infringing copy had it been licensed. While exemplary or additional damages are available, these are discretionary and would be unlikely to be awarded where the alleged infringement was made for the sole purpose of private or domestic viewing only."

 Put 'How do you possibly expect me to remember?!' 




 In a letter in which Tolkien first named Alatar and Pallando, also called Morinehtar and Rmestmo, he wrote concerning them:

I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Numenorean range: missionaries to enemy-occupied lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.

However, in The Peoples of Middle Earth, written by Tolkien in the last years of his life, he said that the Blue Wizards had succeeded in turning the tides of conflict in the East during the Second and Third Ages. Whether this is a revision of what he previously wrote, or whether they were initially successful and then fell, is not known.

The quote from The Peoples of Middle Earth is as follows:

The other two are only known to (have) exist(ed) [sic] by Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast, and Saruman in his wrath mentioning five was letting out a piece of private information.

The 'other two' came much earlier, at the same time probably as Glorfindel, when matters became very dangerous in the Second Age. Glorfindel was sent to aid Elrond and was (though not yet said) pre-eminent in the war in Eriador. But the other two Istari were sent for a different purpose. Morinehtar and Rmestmo. Darkness-slayer and East-helper. Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion ... and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [? dissension and disarray] among the dark East ... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West 




 Hi guys, I've just trawled your website and I'm impressed by what I see. Do you have any plans to spread internationally, because my country could really do with what you say you offer. 




 Legit.
 




 Means nothing if he can't get fast track (which looks doubtful), and enough popular anger becomes apparent. Don't give up, the only way it is sure to pass is if everyone believes it cannot be stopped (or more likely doesn't know about it and how it's likely to affect so much of everything). That said, I'll be going down in flames trying in my country to ensure it isn't ratified if it gets the initial nod. Educate the voting public. This is by far the worst we've seen in recent yearsm which is impressive because we've seen a shit ton. This basically enshrines the rights of corporations in international law superceding national law. Yes it may bolster the US economy in a changing world, but to the detriment of us all. I never in my wildest nightmares envisioned President Obama envisioning this as crown jewels in his legacy. There is scope certainly for sections of it, but everything we see when it gets leaked is so flawed. The participants in drafting it are not representative of the populations it affects, they are by and large corporate interests. This is not a platform we want to enshrine in international law. So get mad now, or regret later. 




 Mass contacting via tools such as those listed above is precisely how CISPA, SOPA/PIPA, ACTA, TAFTA to name a few were stymied. It truly is the most effective way to make a difference, contact your representative and make your opinion clear. Most of them don't even read the damn legislation, too busy fundraising for reelection. Fair enough, they like their jobs. But whilst they rely on donors to fund their prospects, their fate is in the hands of you the people. According to staffers and interns who have commented on this in these threads, they do pay a lot of attention to numbers of constituents who actually chime in on particular issues, because they do not usually get that much traffic, so when they receive an avalanche of angry calls they extrapolate from that to the voting population and pay attention. And whether it passes does not depend on Obama, but on the votes in Congress. Yes, we can kick it's ass, with online participation. There is strength immeasurable in collective action. Apathy and the false impression of powerlessness kills it. There is already considerable disgruntlement with it amongst progressives and libertarians. We need only push en masse to sway the tide of fencesitters.

 Actually, pure gold is not soft enough to deform by biting. People would cut it with lead, suitably heavy and would mix without discoloring. Also made it softer, so if your bite left an imprint, it was *not* pure gold. Not that Olympic gold medals are pure gold anyway. The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. Modern Olympic gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. So there y'go..

 Israel doesn't. There is the opinion that it has become more right wing with the influx of the diaspora from Russia and eastern Europe. We only really get to hear from Americans who are there because easier soundbite, and the more brave the better. It's unsustainable, history moves slow, but maybe we'll get the compromise we need next election. Netanyahu is a cancer on progress, and a self-serving asshole at that, he does not demonstrate a love of country, he demonstrates a love of Bibi, do anything say anything, stir up the red meat of right-wing hatred to the detriment of all in order to stay in power. he is a blight on Israel and a danger to the world. God help us what this term will bring. There is great risk in this play, the guy is incongruous with peace and a pivotal destabiliser. I hope for the best, but I cannot see this turning out pretty for Israelis or Palestinians, or anyone. The guy is a fucking socio-wartard..

 What the hell's wrong with the .net domain name?!

The domain name net is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) used in the Domain Name System of the Internet. The name is derived from network, indicating it was originally intended for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet service providers and other infrastructure companies.

Do you prefer commercial (.com) to networks (.net)?
