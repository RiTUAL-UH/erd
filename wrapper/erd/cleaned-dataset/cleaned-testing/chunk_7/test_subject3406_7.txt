 Thanks, DT. That makes sense. :-) My magsafe 1 is 85, so I should be set. 




 Cool, thanks! :-) I appreciate it. (And hey, it's only $10 for each charger, compared to $75 for each new cable, so, that works.) 




 Hi all. I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question. I have a 17" MacBook Pro from early 2011 that is dying. Sadly, it's out of warranty now and the logic board is going. A $350-500 repair did not seem to make sense, so I bought a 15" MacBook Pro that should be arriving early next week.

I'll still have my power adapters for my 17" MBP that I was planning on using with the new one as my travel power cord (lives in backpack) and my alternate location power cord. BUT-I was in the Apple Store the other day and saw a box for a Magsafe to Magsafe 2 adapter, and the picture in the back looks like the power cords I have currently (no pun intended!). I asked the salesperson if I'd need these to use my old power cords with the new MBP, he looked at me blankly, went off to ask someone else, and told me no, I wouldn't, but I'm a little hesitant to trust his answer.

Thoughts? (And thanks!) 




 I wouldn't necessarily rely on your home insurance. Not only is it a 1k deductible, but a claim could lead to your insurance getting canceled. You might want to ask your insurance company if you can get a personal article policy. That might be what you already asked about and were told was only for camera gear? I have one through State Farm for about $70 a year. 




 I'm afraid I don't recall if its possible to focus on more than one, I think it is? But one does it based on course selections... 




 You can focus in areas like international relations, political thought and theory/public law (my area), American politics, Comparative politics, and political analysis. (See http://govt.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/majorminor ) 




 I was a govt. major, so, if you have any specific questions about the major, fire away. :-) 




 I ordered from Verizon at 4:30AM EST and I'm still being told it'll arrive by 10/14. :( 




 The iPhone displays were fragmented for a very good reason. They knew that there was a big demand (no pun intended) for a 5.5" screen, but that for a sizable portion of their would-be buyers, that was too much. 2 phones means both markets are satisfied. 




 The WSJ and NYT articles this piece links to are worthwhile reads too. 




 Relevant as evidence, maybe. Probable cause or even reasonable suspicion? No. 




 I'd point to some of the oral argument in Wurie last term as an example of the Supreme Court being incredibly out of touch with technology and the real world. Chief Justice Roberts made it clear he thought having multiple cell phones was a sign of being a drug dealer, and Scalia's quip supported that notion. (page 49 of http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-212_86qd.pdf )

Which I suppose means that every Big Law and government lawyer I know with a work cell phone and a personal cell phone are suspicious in Roberts's and Scalia's eyes. 




 Annelise Orleck is teaching History 19: US Political History 20th Century this Fall. I found her classes to be pretty easy, but very interesting. She's a great lecturer! 




 There are a lot of people in this thread castigating the sheriff for his mistake. I suggest that before you call the sherif a murderer or evil or cruel, etc., please read Gene Weingarten's piece from 2009 on parents who forgot their children in hot cars. It's not a black and white issue of good and evilthe importance of a human or canine life does not make our brains any better at remembering their location or condition than it does the keys, phones, and wallets that people lose on a daily basis. The tragedy of these situations shouldn't be compounded by criminal charges in instances where it was a genuine, awful but genuine, mistake.

 No, it's a reasonable question. If a smartphone or watch ("device") is tied to the same account as a smartcard, it would be possible to use a device to enter/exit the station that is part of the pilot, and use one's smartcard to enter/exit at stations that are not. This would expand the usefulness of the test program.

If, on the other hand, payment via device is treated as a new, separate account, the way a separate smartrip card would be, that's unhelpful to most of us. 




 I didn't botch the title-they changed the headline! 




 OP isn't the white hat. This seems like a law school hypothetical: spot the potential civil actions and criminal charges. Civilly, there's potential defamation, tortious interference with contract/tortious interference with business relationship, fraud, and civil cause of action under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Criminally, there's the CFAA and fraud. 




 Ack. Thanks!

 Do these tracking systems apply to both GSM and CDMA phones, or only GSM? 




 This.....is not true. The exact specifics differ from state to state, but generally, defamation (of which slander and libel are subparts) is a untruth about another person which harms the defamed person's reputation.

Actual malice is only generally required if a person is a public figure. A supermarket manager is not.

The question isn't whether OP could sue for defamation. He could. The questions are a: whether he could prove it (probably); and b: whether there was any actual harm to his reputation to the point that he could recover enough $ to make it worth his while. That's a question for a local attorney familiar with the laws of his state, should he choose to pursue it. 




 Horse pucky. The FAA case didn't involve some nebulous concept of "guidelines"it involved the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), a federal statute that applies to the actions of agencies if there is no other statute controlling. It's essentially the default if no special procedures, forms, hearings, etc. are laid out in an agency-specific statute. And it is entirely a federal statuteit has no direct bearing on state administrative agencies.

New York has its own statute, the State Administrative Procedure Act. It certainly embodies many of the concepts of the federal APA, but it is by no means a mirror. (See Bonfield, Arthur Earl, "The Federal APA and State Administrative Law," 72 Va. L. Rev. 297 (March, 1986)). 




 Wayne Brady talks about this during his interview with Aisha Tyler on her podcast Girl on Guy: http://girlonguy.net/podcast/girl-on-guy-45-wayne-brady/ 




 Depends on the state... In some states, the existence of a complaint is in public, and in some, the proceedings themselves are public. 




 Perhaps this is naive of me, but how haven't there been announcements of bar discipline yet? At this point several Federal judges have referred Prenda Law lawyers to the disciplinary bodies, and there seems to be an allegation that Steele commingled his personal funds in his IOLTA account. Shouldn't disbarment proceedings be well under way? 




 This is not the right subreddit for what you are looking for. This is a relatively small subreddit for legal education, not for legal advice.

There are subreddits out there that may give advice, but it sounds like you need a lawyer, not random advice from people on the internet. Talk to a tax attorney in your jurisdiction and do it now. 




 Power strips are cheap enough that there's really no reason not to have one. Worst case scenario, you'll have something on hand if a couple of friends visit campus, crash in your room, and need a place to charge gadgets. 




 As Breez_E said, every house is different. Some houses are very alcohol focused. A few are drug focused. Some revolve around a sport. Some are LGBQT friendly. There are the coed houses. Some are rumored to haze, others stay far away from anything like that.

For the most part, you don't need to join a house to go to its parties.

People have given good advice in this thread. The things I'll add are: (1) Half of people at Dartmouth don't rush, and there is still plenty of things for them to do. You can still go to parties, as I said, the Hop brings plenty of amazing performers to campus at a student price that makes alum cry when they pay to see the same performers in the real world, there are a thousand clubs, intramural sports, the DOC, etc. (2) One benefit of joining a house is that it's a way of staying connected to campus. When you visit, you'll have a place to go with people you can connect with, even if you graduated years and years ago. 




 In high school, I took Algebra I as a freshman, Geometry as a sophomore, and Algebra II as a junior. Then, senior year, I took extra history electives.

 I had this exact problem with an 2017 "17 MacBook ProI started experiencing crashes and visual artifacts that looked like vertical stripes. Thankfully, I was within the warranty period by a month and a half so it was repaired at no cost to me, but there is clearly a known issue with 2011 MBPs and Apple should damn well stand behind its products.

 As someone relatively new to Virginia, can I ask for a fuller explanation of the Commonwealth's unique City/County arrangement, or a link to a good explanation of it? :) 




 I'd say that's an incomplete list. One can be jailed for not paying court costs, including private probation companies' fees, a situation that many have called the new debtors' prisons. See https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform-racial-justice/court-sanctioned-extortion-private-probation-companies , for example. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/opinion/return-of-debtors-prisons.html too. 




 Assuming I live in Virginia and on my way home from work, I purchase a good in MarylandI'd be paying Maryland sales tax. Being a resident of Virginia, I'm not represented at all in Maryland. Do you believe it is wrong for me to be taxed by a government I have absolutely no ability to persuade how much sales tax it decides to charge?

The internet versus brick and mortar doesn't make the answer any different. And the Constitution doesn't enter into either of our scenariosthere's not a single line in the text or any case law that would support the argument you made about constitutionality. 




 Amazon already doesAmazon collects sales tax in the states where it has a physical presence: Arizona, California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia. 




 I don't believe it would be as apocalyptic as you portray. Technology makes filing taxes a heck of a lot easier than it used to be. Businesses, some run by millennials, would develop software that would make compliance workable.

But if your argument is based on compliance costs, that's the argument you should have made. Instead, on the radio and on your website, you relied on a bogus claim that the act would be unconstitutional. I like to think millennials value truth as much as we value cheap shit online, and your argument was just buzzwords thrown together. *edited to fix spelling of one word 




 Sorry, but the arguments here were absurd. GenOpp keeps using the word unconstitutional, and it does not mean what they think it means. There is nothing unconstitutional about the Internet Sales Tax. A: It's not taxation without representationother than the people in D.C., we have representatives in Congress that are the folks trying to pass the bill! B: There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution prohibiting taxation without representation, otherwise people in the District of Columbia would be exempt from paying federal taxes.

As was pointed out in the clip but seemingly ignored, this isn't a new taxit's an enforcement mechanism. People are supposed to be paying taxes on internet purchases, but nobody does. An internet sales tax does not create a new tax, it just requires people to actually pay what they were supposed to in the first place.

This isn't about fairness. This isn't about technology. As the guest and host admit halfway through, this is about Republicans wanting to do what they always docut or eliminate taxes. Trying to approach it from the angle of protecting the internet marketplace is just transparent pandering towards young people. 




 It's a sweet thought, but there is no one law magazine that would be helpful/good/popular. Since the laws of each state are different, there are different law magazines/newspapers for each one. 




 I'd think the Morse v. Frederick case might be controlling, along with Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier. 




 His counterpart, Rob Paulsen, was Pinky and Yakko Warner on Animaniacs, Snow Job and Tripwire on G.I.

Joe, Zoltan on the animated Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, he's the voice of Dizzy Devil, he did several voices for Captain Planet including Duke Nukem and Verminous Skumm, he took over Yosemite Sam from Mel Blanc, he's done Pepe Le Pew, he was Pasha on Jonny Quest, he's Foghorn Leghorn, he was the voice of the garbageman on the animated Dilbert, he was Mortimer Mouse on House of Mouse, he was Dr. Freeze in the Batman: Arkham City game, Dr. Doom on the Ultimate Spider Man, Kif Kroker and Morbo on Futurama, and a little-known character from Animaniacs named the Brain. 




 That's absurd. Argentina made a choice to set NY as the place with jurisdiction to hear disputes over its bonds because doing so gave it lower interest rates. Doing so waived any claims of sovereign immunityArgentina made the choice to accept US jurisdiction and it received a benefit at the time for doing so. 









 I find it to work well. Unlike cabs when I've found them to often not show up (and at best, the dispatcher will give you a time range of 10-30 minutes for someone to show up), the Uber app shows exactly where your driver is and gives an ETA as to how long it will take your driver to arrive.

 Yes-Ebola carries a 50-90% mortality rate, but this treatment has not been proven effective. Nothing has been proven. Those two relief workers were the very first human beings to ever receive the drug.  It certainly cannot be said that this drug could have been provided to anyone else sooner.

Nor is it appropriate to start sending this out to Africa en masse now. Two people are doing better on this new, untested drug. (Two people is not a test.) We have no idea what factors led to it working and might lead to it killing or causing long term effect. We have no idea if it works differently on the young versus old, white versus black (primaquine is an example of a drug that works differently on certain races), weight, diet, medical histories and conditions, all can cause drugs to impact populations differently.

There may be a point before final FDA of a drug where it is nevertheless appropriate to supply it to those in need. This serum is nowhere near that stage. 




 When searching Reddit to ensure it hadn't been posted anywhere, I saw this thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jlkk6/governor_rick_perry_refused_cameron_todd/) on /r/politics from two years ago that got a lot of comments, so I assumed that this new article would make for a good followup. Since the rules require the title to come from the article, I couldn't explicitly say as much, but I figured it would be okay. 




 Sounds really good! :-) 




 The already horrifying case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who many believe was wrongfully executed in Texas in 2004, has gotten worse. 

Previously, the forensic "evidence" against Willingham was shown to be complete and utter bunkthe arson investigators' testimony was riddled with supposedly scientific testimony that turned out to be utterly untrue when tested.

Now, there may be evidence that the jailhouse informer who testified against Willingham received leniency for his testimony, and that Texas prosecutors conspired to conceal this leniency (and in court, denied there were any deals).

I may not be able to say 100% that Willingham was innocent, but I can say that he was railroaded in a rigged trial. His execution was a travesty of justice. 









 2 years sounds light for assaulting a faire employee, tbh. 




 Good value at the theater and the people working there are really nice. It's a good kickstarter if any of you have the extra scratch to give. 




 Slightly ridiculous, sure! Ignorant, certainly. Racist? I don't see it. Through movies, novels, etc., ebola has been portrayed as an ultra contagious disease, and West Africa is experiencing one of the worst ebola outbreaks ever. It's ignorant for people to be concerned about being exposed to ebola from this summit (ebola is highly infectious-it takes a tiny amount to infect someone-but it is not highly contagious because it generally does not infect anyone through the air), but I don't think people are saying "eek-black people!", I think they're saying "eek-there's an uncontrolled ebola outbreak in West Africa!" 




 An excellent question, and for Colorado, I don't know. As a theoretical matter (removing it from the sphere of jurisdictional-specific case law), I could see a potential case against both. The facility for failing to notify its employees and the police for failing to ensure participants were aware this might occur. (The odds of an unknowing person being affected by this drill seem higheven if the home warned its nurses, what about delivery people? Patients' families? Other visitors? This points to possible recklessness on the part of the police.) 




 You'd be right in some jurisdictions, but I believe in Colorado, it is enough for the act itself to be intentional with reckless disregard for the emotional health of the affected individual(s).

Depending on what the nursing home and the police agency involved knew and disclosed to the appropriate people, it is possible that either or both could be liable. 




 Sounds like it could potentially give rise to a lawsuit for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (1) The conduct seems sufficient to cause emotional harm in the average person; and (2) If the nurse was not given notice that this sort of drill was occurring or might occur, it would seem to be reckless disregard of the emotional harm such a drill could cause. 

(Standard disclaimer: Not a Colorado-licensed attorney, not your attorney, not giving legal advice, etc.) 




 Good grief...In some jurisdictions, this situation would make a nice test question about negligent infliction of emotional distress. 




 It's a chicken and egg problem. DC isn't as transit-dependent as NYC because DC's transit is not as dependable as NYC. Metro is a commuter rail system because weekend service sucks. If trains were 10 minutes apart instead of 20 minutes apart, you'd see a lot more people choosing Metro over driving or taking a cab. 




 Thanks! :-) It's not a combination I'd have come up with on my own, but it sounds good! 




 Cement? As in the stuff that Hamas is using for its tunnels instead of using to build housing, hospitals, schools, etc.? 




 Welcome to the family, MurderingOcelot. As doublesecretprobatn said, the River is far and low on amenities compared to some other dorms, but it tends to be more social than some of the other dorms too.

When you pick your classes, don't forget to factor travel time from your dorm. It's about a fifteen minute walk from the River Cluster to the Life Sciences Center on the opposite end of campus. If you're not a science major, you might want to think about taking a 9AM bio class your sophomore year instead. 




 Except in this case, it hasn't worked out too well. 




 Executive Orders aren't binding on the Executive, just subordinates. If the Executive gives new instructions that are in conflict with a prior Executive Order, the new instructions hold.

Think of it as a New Years resolution. It's all well and good to make a resolution that you aren't going to have fried food and dessert in the same meal, but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory ordering fried mac and cheese and the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, you're going to get what you ordered. 




 Israel allows fuel, water, medicine, etc. to go to Gaza. The one thing they do ban is concrete/cement, on the grounds that it would be diverted for terrorist purposes like tunnels.

Given the elaborate tunnel network that Hamas put in place even with the restrictions, Israel was right. And note that Hamas is in control of the Gaza stripthey made the choice to use what cement they did have to build terror tunnels instead of infrastructure. 




 Israel's blockade? A: If anything, it's Israel's and EGYPT's blockade.

 B: Is there any doubt that if there was a naval and air blockade on Gaza, Hamas, Fatah, and other assorted groups would have sent terrorists by sea to blow up civilians. and flown planes into buildings?

C: As far as controlling who and what goes in and out of Gaza by land on the Israeli/Gaza border, that's not a blockade! It's a right of any sovereign nation to determine who and what goes through it. Does controlling the Israel/Gaza border lock in the people of Gaza? Absolutely. But it's not an illegal blockade, it's geography. Even the 1948 borders didn't have Gaza and the West Bank coming close to intersecting (didn't matter then because Gaza was part of Egypt and the West Bank was part of Jordan, but nobody seems to think of that as an occupation). 




 How much of each item do you put in those smoothies, /u/baked_potato_ ? 




 Preponderance of the evidence is more probable than nota greater than 50% chance of the claim asserted being true. This is the standard of proof required in most civil cases.

Clear and convincing evidence is between preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt. It's a term of art to be sure, but generally requires a greater degree of certainty but total certainty in the claim asserted. 




 Only Zuul. 




 I'm not challenging you or being contrarian, but I'm curious why you think there isn't a government shutdown threat this year? It's almost the end of July, Congress takes off August, there's still no deal on a budget or a continuing resolution yet, and as you said, Sept. 30th is the deadline.

I find it hard to imagine either party allowing a government shutdown to happy so close to the midterm elections, but I also have a hard time imaging the parties coming together on a budget deal without strife. 




 Frustrating seeing the Youtube comments saying that pedestrians shouldn't be on the "cycle-path". That's no different from jerks arguing that bikes shouldn't be allowed on the road. It's not a "cycle-path"it's a mixed use trail! 




 This...seems strange. How would a fake driver know where to go? Moreover, the app tells me the name and license plate of the assigned driver so I can find the right car. 




 Down near Pentagon City. :/ I tried calling, and was told by the automated system that the wait time was over an hour, so I figured that there was either a widespread outage or Verzon's customer service staffing was abysmal. Could be both, I suppose. 




 It was a replica. Who cares? 




 On the first day of my BarBri classes, the instructor told us that every point we got above passing was time we should have spent pursuing outside interests, pursuing outside people, or at the beach. While I'm not quite as cavalier about it as him, the general point stands. 

The bar exam is incredibly important, it's hard, but it's pass/fail and you're a smart cookie to have gotten as far as you have. Do the preparation, don't freak out if you come across an essay question where you don't know the answer (take a deep breath and think like a lawyer), and you should be fine. 




 I use pasta to thicken soups. You can use a smaller pasta, like ditalini, if you don't want it to distract from the main ingredients of your soup or stew. 




 A genocide in which the population has grown every year? 




 You're rightIsrael does not have the worst equipment ever. So why is the death toll as small as it is? The Gaza Strip is a tiny slice of land and Israel has powerful weaponry. If Israel treated Gaza the way Russia leveled Grozny in 1999/2000, they wipe Gaza off the map in less than 12 hours.

Destroying everything is easy if you are willing to commit the sort of massacre that people are rightly condemning Moshe Feiglin for suggesting. Either Israel is not deliberately engaging in an extermination campaign against civilians or they have the worst equipment ever, and we agree that they do not have the worst equipment ever.

Avoiding civilian casualties is hard, regardless of the quality of one's military might. Bad intelligence, an 18-y-o kid at the weapons controls with an itchy trigger finger, or just the dense nature of the Gaza Strip, there are lots of factors that can lead to civilian deaths. Every military conflict has had tragic errors similar to the kids on the beach. (The wedding party the US blew up in Yemen in February comes to mind.) 




 Did you put on blackface and do a minstrel show dance while typing that racist drivel? 




 Israel controls the land border because it borders with Israelno country is required to allow people from another state or territory to enter their own. (And Egypt controls the border between Egypt and Gaza, so why is Israel seen as occupying Gaza but not Egypt?) Israel controls the sea and air space because nobody serious disputes that if opened, it would be used for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, akin to 9/11 (air attack) or the Hamas frogmen (sea attack) that attempted an attack earlier this week.

The biggest thing that isolates Gaza is geography, not a discriminatory Israeli policy. 




 Looks like Hannibal Smith (from the A-Team) in one of the disguises he used to investigate potential clients.  




 I agree with almost everything you said, /u/Ice_Clown. My one addition would be to suggest offering to write a generic letter of recommendation now AND write tailored letters of recommendation upon request later. People in government positions sometimes move around and in two years when OP's intern wants a recommendation for OCI or other positions, she may not be able to find OP. 




 Very nicely done! :-) 




 In Bethesda just over the MD/DC border, the folks at Westbard Citgo II are fantastic. It's at 5335 Westbard Avenue. They're very honest and conservative (repair-wise, I mean, not politically)-they won't tell you to replace something unless it really needs it. 




 Lawyer2Lawyer has been really good. http://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/lawyer-2-lawyer/ 




 Heh. About six months after turning 21, I went to a NH restaurant and asked for a cocktail. The waitress looked at my ID, went off for a manager, and I was told that I could not get alcohol. Why? Because my ID said under 21 until XX/XX/XX. Even though it was after that date, because it said "under 21", they wouldn't serve me. 




 At the risk of sounding disrespectful, it seems as though you're missing the point. There is no need to justify a termination in Virginia. So long as the termination isn't for a prohibited reason, and "retaliation for questioning the 'eyes of the law'" is not a prohibited reason, employees can be fired for any or no reason. Someone can be fired because their new manager doesn't like redheads. Or because he doesn't like names starting with the letter M. Or for no reason at all.

Since my prior post has been down voted a bit, let me note that I'm not defending the decision to fire him, nor am I happy with the at-will doctrine. I find the lack of basic protections for employees abhorrent. But it is what it is (as so many things are). It's not something that's going to be changed based on a court challenge-it would require a legislative change. I'd support such a change. But until then, his performance, whether he's had any disciplinary or corrective action, or how long he's been with the company, all of that doesn't matter. Target could fire him at any time and they chose to do so. 




 *nods* :-) Crystal City has the benefit of more restaurants (some really delicious ones), being able to get around underground to avoid the elements, wider bar options, the Synaptic Theater, etc.

Pentagon City has the benefit of more outdoor space (including the soccer field/baseball field and public park), the mall (which can be good for shopping, getting electronics repaired, etc. but bad in that it often has gaggles of roaming middle and high school student grounds), and Harris Teeter in walking distance. 




 I'm in RiverHouse, and I think it would probably suit your needs, /u/Smitty2k1. 




 Same story as one posted in /r/music two months ago, just with Neil Young swapped in for the Stones.

To quote what I said in the previous thread, "[Roger] Waters has repeatedly played in China and Russia. He played in Venezuela while Hugo Chavez was in power...I agree that Israel, like any country, does things one might criticize, and that criticizing Israel is not a sign of anti-semitism. If one only criticizes Israel, anti-semitism may become a reasonable inference.

Russia's genocidal policies towards the Chechens eclipsed anything Israel has done towards Palestinians [*coughs* Grozny *coughs*], and yet Roger Waters voiced no criticism of them and indeed, continues to perform in Russia. (Not to mention Russian persecution of homosexuals, current actions towards the Ukraine, the invasion of Georgia, the murder of journalists (such as Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, and Stanislav Markelov), etc.)


China's human rights violations are of such a scale, it is difficult to choose a place to begin. Given that Waters has invoked apartheid in his criticism of Israel, however, perhaps a good starting point is China's discrimination towards it rural workers as part of the hukou system. Many have described the hukou system as apartheid (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm , for example). China's actions towards Tibet could be said to be analogous to apartheid. And yet Waters voices no criticism of China. And Roger Waters performs in China."

 Hydrox cookies. I know, I know, it's a terrible name for a food product but they were absolutely delicious. By the 90s, most consumers thought they were imitation Oreos, but in fact, Sunshine Biscuits first sold Hydrox in 1908. After seeing the Hydrox's success, the National Biscuit company (now Nabisco) came out with a knockoff version in 1912: Oreos. 

What made Hydrox superior to Oreos was the cookie element. Hydrox had a harder cookie  not break-a-tooth-tough, but sufficiently stiffer that Oreos seem mushy in comparison. 




 A case for what, exactly? I'm not sure why /u/MostlyBullshitStory has been downvotedthey are right. It sucks, sure, but Virginia is an at-will state, so employees can be fired at any time for any reason, or even for no reason. The exceptions are that federal law protects people from being fired due to age, race, religion, gender, national origin, or disability, and a Virginia statute protects people form being fired for filing a safety or health complaint. (Shoplifting is not considered a safety or health complaint.)

It does not matter if the employee has being doing something for 8 years without issue-the employee can be fired at any time so long as it doesn't fall into one of the exceptions above.
