 I just saw this last weekend for the first time. I loved it! 




 Exit Through the Gift Shop 




 Unclear why this is in personal finance.

It's hard to give you advice without understanding the gravity of what you have done. Let's say you were snooping around the internal systems and deleted a bunch of critical files that could create significant financial issues for the company. What should you do then?

My take - come clean. Tell them how you stumbled on those files and the mistake you made, and the ramifications. Offer to help rectify the situation. Offer to make it up to them financially by working hard. 

They might fire you. If what you did was of the sort that I suggested, then they should reassess their internal policies and security. They might be glad that you came forward and just reprimand you.

I think you will be glad you came forward and came clean. Assuming what you did was not a criminal act, but the mistake of someone with little work experience, then it's not the end of the world. Find someone you trust at this work place to be a reference, and start applying for other jobs. 

Leaving without owning up doesn't help them, and doesn't help you (unless what you did was criminal). 

Good luck.  




 I did 5 years of long distance across 2 continents. I then moved in with her 5 years ago and married her 2 years ago, and feel like the luckiest guy ever. 

3 pieces of advice:
1. Use every piece of communication available. We used text message, FaceTime, Skype, email, written mail, Facebook pokes, everything...if we could send smoke signals, we would have. 

2. Have a routine to talk to each other every day and make an effort to be available.

3. Depending on where you are, traveling to see each other can get expensive, so plan in advance, and try and make the visits equitable.

Good luck! 



















 Keep it simple. Rent / borrow a projector and a good sound system, invite all the fun people you know - have a movie marathon, or a board game night - or both. Host a giant pajama party 




 You could:

1. Cook an elaborate meal without people getting in the way / asking you what you are making, etc.

2. Host your own "The Real World" reality TV show and put it up on YouTube, and try and become an internet sensation

3. Spin on 2 - use it to make your own music video  - or MTV cribs episode

4. Make a haunted mansion, charge folks admission - make some dough

5. Start your own pop-up store. Try the idea out with your free real estate, if it works - you know what you can do over summer

6. Epic game of laser tag

7. List the place. Have an open house. As potential buyers inappropriate questions.

8. Get pets!!

 









 Has to be the Trojans losing. People are still talking about it 1000s of years later.  
























 In my awful bachelor apartment which I shared with 2 other guys.  














 Santa Claus. 

But seriously - history is the biggest lie I've ever been told cuz we are told it over and over again. When I read "People's History of the United States", I was blown away. I don't think that Howard Zinn's version of history is necessarily right, but the idea that there is a single narrative that explains how we got here is definitely wrong, and everything I learned and believed in was based on a homogeneous narrative. So history is the biggest lie I've been told.  









 I just went ahead, bought another apartment and another car. Have TWC at home but got Fios there - you can't be too careful. My fapping routine involves changing into my fap  clothes, driving my fab-mobile, to my fap-apartment, firing up my new modem, watching it on my fap-puter, taking a shower, and then heading back to the wife. You just can't be too careful with these things. If I get caught, it could be so embarrassing.  




 I would generally disclose a range where the low end of the range is where you would settle for a job, and the high end is potentially 10-20% above that. Don't disclose your current salary unless you trust that headhunter or staffing agency, but giving a range of what you would move for (which would be typically higher than your current comp) is normal.

To other questions - I would be generally honest, with a grain of salt. If you are really unhappy at your current workplace, don't bitch to the headhunter. Be somewhat candid at your reasons for looking for a new job and the type of job you are looking for, but don't say anything that if it came back to your current employer would leave you mortified. 
 




 This was the original flash sales site and was always so much fun. The site still exists but its just not the same any more. Ever since Amazon bought it, there is no witty writing, no punchline, nothing. No bags of crap. I know those guys started another site that is similar to woot, but its not the same. I miss woot.  









 I used to be on the West Coast and now am on the East Coast for many years. Shake Shack is not an in-an-out equivalent. Its a much higher end product at a much higher end cost. Agree with you that its much better than Five Guys but In-n-out is much more "for the people". Also Shake Shack recently IPOd so its too early to say that it has the reputation of quality over money relative to In-n-Out. 

Also In-n-Out has a secret menu that puts everyone else to shame.  




 In-n-Out is a good example of a company forgoing long term growth so they wouldn't compromise their product and user experience. There are other such examples - Basecamp / 37 signals from which Ruby on Rails came out of. Craigslist is another example where he could have sold for a massive amount but chose not to.

There is Quora that for years on end has run with no monetization and it is unclear if there will ever be monetization. 

Finally - there are "B-corps". Benefit corps that are for-profit companies that are also specifically focused on sustainability and community values. These are companies like Easy, Warby Parker, and many others. I am not 100% sure that this doesn't end up mocked like Google's "don't be evil" clause, but the B-corp certification from B-Lab is fairly difficult and intense to get. 
 









 One of them would be the Russian commander during the Cuban missile crisis who prevented the launch of nuclear missiles and saved the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov

But part of me almost believes in the Psychohistorian approach proposed by Isaac Asimov in the Foundation series where historical figures are all actors in the evolution of the world. If they didn't exist, someone else would step into their place. Hitler the man was a catalyst in a country deeply impacted by WWI and with a deep racial divide. Gandhi was a leader who united a country but it only hastened the weakening of an already weakened colonial state.   

Shakespeare developed art, and language almost single-handedly but his absence would have led people to read other great writers of that time and language would not be impacted, just different.  




 5 things go into any good cover letter:
First para: A short 2 sentence about you and how you heard about this opportunity
Second para: Why are you excited about this role
Third para: Why your experiences in comedy are perfect for this job - you are both a writer but have standup experience so understand the delivery as well as comedic writing. You love sketch and standup comedy and can bring both experiences to bear. 
Fourth para: What do you see as unique about the Conan show and this job and how that mixes perfectly with who you are. (Down-to-earth show that has never been scared to innovate. Pioneers in web video. You aren't just a writer looking for a brand name gig but a chance to work at a place on TV where writers are looking to try new concepts across media)
Last para - you are very excited and would love to share your writing samples with the. and a quick polite finish.

Keep it simple. I have never applied for a comedy job so I am guessing it might help to be funny, but have someone else (not you or your gf review it) so you are sure the humor travels and isn't misconstrued.

Good luck and get on that television! 




 Thanks for this. I was scared out of my mind when I had my first fender bender. It was a light one but it felt like a massive accident, the way the car shook and the whiplash.

The crazy, disorienting part was when we pulled over and the lady was shaken up and apologetic - someone came and offered her a phone number so she can call them as witness in case I tried to extort her for money. Granted my car was an old beat up one, but I was just so upset that I got rammed into and then I was made to feel like the person in the wrong.  




 Sure thing, and good luck. If helpful check out tapwage.com which has a lot of junior software / IT / MIS jobs at non-tech firms.  Feel free to ping me if you have any follow up questions 









 If you have an interest in pursuing MIS work as opposed to IT / software engineering work - then you are better off going to a non-technology company. So a bank, hospital, healthcare company or any other type of regular large company is your best bet. You will get a chance to learn about more than just software and systems and actually see processes. You could even go to the finance and reporting team at one of those companies  - since many such finance roles exist and that expands the potential scope of your career into data and analytics type roles. If your IT skills are primarily in Microsoft products as it seems to be, this is another indicator that you are better off applying to a large and medium sized non-tech firm than a tech firm. 


Salary depends significantly on where you are based and what specific development experience you have. It sounds like you have  a number of skills but perhaps not a lot of dev experience. So unless you are in SF, LA, NY - chances are your salary range is on the lower end of the range you provided. In those cities, you can sort of expect a salary in the middle of that range but it really depends on your actual dev experience. 

Finally - certifications again depend on where you want to take your career. If you see yourself in a IT / tech role at a non-tech company, Microsoft certifications can help get your foot in the door but not a lot of value beyond that. You are better of investing your time doing internships or projects that let you actually get dev experience.
