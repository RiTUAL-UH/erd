 I want to create a website and I would like to hire other web developers and designers to help make this website. Also the money will allow me to let local business's spend less money on the website for advertising. This opportunity helps not only other web developers/designers but the community as well.    gofundme.com/thistown 




 I need a simple drawing (preferably black and white) of a hellhound or Kerberos(hades hound). I need it for a logo. Doesn't need to be big. Thank you very much.
