 The thing is...as far as the job search goes, it's not your responsibility to see if you're eligible, it's the company's. It doesn't matter what you think of your abilities. If you want the job, apply for it.

Then it's up to them to see if you're a good fit. For example, the entry level developer is a pretty broad position; they might have a particular position in a particular team in mind which requires a more analytic frame of mind which your EE degree would have kindly blessed you with.

So, go forth and be brave. Don't reject yourself. Let them reject you! 




 I just took that interview last month and got an offer...Will be glad to answer questions...though I can't deal with specifics of the questions since I signed an NDA.

It's an all-day coding project and you work with what seems to be a simplified version of a real-world problem. You can (and should!) ask questions of your teammates and the employees in the room with you. You can ask Google (I mean, the internet..you'll have access to internet) for help if you want... but basically don't hesitate to ask anyone questions.

The problem really tests your basic coding skills -- whether you can drill a problem down to what it requires, design a data structure for the problem and then use it well to solve it. The one-on-one is very relaxed as well and has to do with the problem itself and make sure you ask him all the questions you have about the work and work culture at Amazon at that interview!

It's a lot of fun and much less stressful than the process at other companies...Good luck! 

And ask away if you have questions... 




 Nah, it's One two three One two One two three..

It's the same beat structure that Coldplay uses in Clocks.. much, much more going on here:) 




 I'm more familiar with an Indian Classical style of counting. So, it's a beat of 16 split up as 3-2-3-3-2-3 ... which works out to 4/4 really.

The (3-2) part is what sounds like 5/4 




 Thanks!

What are "affirmations"? 

I do go to the gym (/r/Fitness to the rescue!) and am working on clothes and grooming step by step...

Great advice in the linked post! 




 This may be slightly weird... but whatever, I'm counting on anonymity, even though I'm not using a throwaway.

Here are the facts: I'm 29, only been in one relationship. The sex was bad. I was/am quite bad at it too.

The constraints: I am Asian (Indian) and will soon be under extreme pressure to get married. 

So say I have two years left. 

I've been reading seddit for a while now and have gone from complete AFC to slightly AFC. I can now talk to girls, #-close, but nothing further. I have cultural barriers in addition to confidence barriers. In addition, I assume every girl is racist even though I've mostly found that it's me being racist about myself and everyone else is fine...if that makes sense.

So yeah, say I have two years left and I want to get good at seduction+sex, the whole process.

Plus, I'm moving to Seattle from a really small town in four months.

I want to hit the ground running there. What, specifically, should I do before then to ensure that I have the courage to go out and screw up or screw someone whenever I want to?

 




 But doesn't 'halal' in fact exactly refer to the processing of the meat and the way the chicken is killed, etc?

I always assumed that halal food implied a better quality of meat. 




 I'm a drummer and I'm in college. Get an Electronic Kit (I have the Yamaha Express and it's really good!) and you can play with headphones.

You'll think the electronic kit sounds good at first, then you'll think it sounds like shit when you play on an acoustic kit (esp w.r.t dynamics) after two years and then finally, you'll see you have no choice because of where you live.

As for where to learn, I would strongly recommend taking 2-3 hours of lessons (more if you can afford them) at $20 (or whatever)/hour. It's really worth it and to this day, I regret not taking lessons when I started. It really lays the fundamentals for everything that follows.

If you need any more advice, PM me...This is a subject I love talking about :D 




 Some humans can beat all horses. All horses can beat some humans. 

So the best long distance runners are *some* humans, but *all* horses are competitive too. 




 I just reopened the book at a random page to find something (and then re-reopened at another random location so that I won't give you spoilers):

"Kid's in the shower", he said, motioning a cigar towards the sound of water hissing in another room. The room in which we stood (we were standing because there was nothing to sit on) seemed as though it were just being moved into; you expected to smell wet paint. Suitcases and unpacked crates were the only furniture. The crates served as tables. One supported the mixings of a martini; another a lamp, a Libertyphone, Holly's red cat and a bowl of yellow roses. Bookcases, covering one wall, boasted a half-shelf of literature. I warmed to the room at once, I liked its fly-by-night look.

It's not that he's describing something special. But as a writer, if I think about it, there's absolutely no way I could have gotten such a strong impression across to the reader in so few words. He knows exactly what in the room (the scene the sounds, the objects...everything!) is relevant to get a feel for the place and the time and the people involved.

Amazing stuff to learn from. 




 Whoever writes it, if the only thing you have to prioritize over the article is a youtube video, then read the article. Else, use your judgement before reading.

If it's a writer you respect, read anyway. Follow the advice. Use your judgement.

For example, this one's advice from Neil Gaiman. I think he knows more than me and I love his stories and trust that he will give practical advice that will still make it seem like you're following your dream and being awesome.

So I read it and when his advice contradicts mine, I trust his. 




 I just read Breakfast at Tiffanys by Truman Capote. That guy can write!

I'm really trying to understand his framing of sentences, the way he says just enough about a scene so you think you're there...he's brilliant. 

 




 And there are people like me, who don't have to prove anything. Ha! 




 I did not know that. Thank you, kind person on the internet! 




 I ran 5-6 miles on off days for two months along with SS. Didn't kill my gains at all. 

In general, for me, SS makes me sleepy after while running makes me energetic. Is it similar for you? 









 Many thanks for that...His version is very cool indeed. 




 Sprint training...60 minutes...Wow..that's hard!

I'm a long distance runner. 7 hours a week is no problem at all. But 60 minutes sprinting is crazy. 

Any sprinters here? I used to do short-distance (200 m and 400 m) and really, 2 sprints of 400 m took everything out of me. That's less than 2 minutes of sprinting and my day was done! What does "60 minutes a week of sprinting" really entail? 




 There's an excellent subreddit for classical music: /r/classicalmusic . They're a bit pretentious, but in a good natured way. The music is great though, and that's what really matters! 




 No No. I like the original look much better...Well, maybe I'm the only one...or maybe it's just a personal opinion of the second style, but there's more personality in the first look. 




 Huh...that would be dumb of me to not notice that. I rarely use A-mode...it's mostly used by people who borrow my camera. My shooting is mostly Auto, then Manual, Manual, Manual, Manual.... (for the same picture!) 




 Ha...I didn't take good care of it at all. 

The thing is, metering seems to not work only A-mode. It always chooses a value that's too dark. What setting might be causing this? 




 I'm not sure, actually. I will check and let you know. I rarely use the only other lens I have...thanks! 




 I've had a Nikon D40 for 5 years now which I've used extensively. She's been through a lot, poor thing... Snow, ice, rain, wind. She's been dropped and thrown and swung.

Anyway, emotional speech over. These days, I've noticed the camera doesn't focus properly, it doesn't meter properly (especially in Aperture mode...why is that?) and I was just curious what happens to the camera as it gets old?

What gives way first, in a technical sort of way? 




 That was awesome! 

Don't know why they felt the need to say "Freakin'" though... Hate that. 









 Yes yes. But it's the getting to the point in his life where he can climb Everest without legs that's the story and the struggle. 

Even for people with legs, the actual climb up the mountain is a very small part of a very long struggle and planning process. 

 




 Oh yeah. I was on Linux last year and man, IllinoisNet was a constant pain with Broadcomm drivers... 




 Was on my end too. Funnily enough, it was all good on the third floor.

Maybe it was just a bandwidth issue...or something. 




 Sitting in siebel, unable to connect 




 Thanks a lot!! 









 Education without wisdom is like a hot lesbian to a heterosexual male. Nice to look at, but pretty fucking worthless.

And the heterosexual male to the hot lesbian is a pretty worthless fuck. 




 He's one of my favourite drummers. I first heard this song a few years back, then found out he played for Sting, and then that he had a a few albums out with his own name. That's about it from me :) 









 I have a quick question for you. I hike and snowboard, and have always wanted to do both together, especially since I went to the Mono Lake area. Some of the mountains there were awesome!

Silly as the question maybe, do you carry your boots and bindings along with the snowboard? Or is there some cooler way to attach the snowboard to your feet wearing your hiking boots?

I ask, because if I have to do all of that, backpacking may be a bad idea...Car camping/Dayhikes+ Snowboarding would be the way to go... 




 Ahh! 10 + 9...Makes sense now :) 




 Okay I can't really decide if it's 21 (10.5 x 2) or 10x2... My brain can't keep up with the song...Any drummers here care to chip in?

EDIT: http://www.jazz.com/music/2008/2/5/mahavishnu-orchestra-celestial-terrestrial-commuters

 No man...read the comment. Girls can't be dudes. That's what she was sayin' 




 Sounds a lot like Miso...except miso doesn't come in a shallow bowl...and it's on the English menu too... 

But it is delicious, if you want to try something else! 




 I'll be out for dinner. I will join you guys later. Could you PM me a number I could text/call so I'll know where you guys are?

EDIT: *Facepalm* Just saw the date...never mind... I'll be there the next meetup! 




 Very nice!

What camera/lens/settings did you use? 









 Ironic that I'm asking on reddit, yes. But this is where I come to for a lot of my questions.

However, I want to try and stay off reddit for a few (at least two) weeks. I've tried the following and couldn't keep up:

1/ Restrict reddit usage only to specific subreddits
2/ Use StayFocusd
3/ Use a time tracker
4/ Pure will power (this never works for me anyway)

Any ideas you guys have will be greatly appreciated.

The reason I'm doing this: I just went through a really bad time the last few months where I lost a lot that really mattered to me. This has made me realize that unless I make some drastic changes to how I live, well....I will continue living how I live, and I'm not happy with it.

To this end, I want to take out everything till I see myself for what I am, and then let things in one by one. I'm not sure that makes sense (or is even relevant to this post), but reddit is one of these things. So, ideas welcome, even if all you say is "Suck it up and try your ideas again"! 




 Kraken by China Meiville. I'm reading because I really, really liked The City, The City.

But Kraken is crap in comparison. Very disappointing. 














 The pretense is necessary because I'm not good enough to be able to express myself without it :)  




 Ah I guess mine's slightly different. I'm mostly very emotional while writing these poems and find that punctuation only spoils what I'm trying to say.

But if/when I edit, I will keep your excellent advice in mind. Thank you :)
 




 I'm on Week 10 (approximately) of Starting Strength and my Squat is at 215x5x3 (My height 6 ft, my weight 171 lbs).

For the last three sessions, the right side of my groin has been hurting when I get to the heavy weights. Today, I finally asked an experienced bodybuilder what I might be doing wrong. He said that it's on one of these three:

1/ I don't warm up
2/ I don't drink enough water
3/ I don't breathe while squatting.

While I do warm, I found out that he was absolutely right about 2/ and 3/. I don't drink water at all and I practically hold my breath. That's why I get dizzy too, supposedly...Who knew? So that's the PSA!

I need advice on what I should do about the groin pain. I find it doesn't interfere with the weights, though it hurts quite a bit on the last few sets.

Should I reset to a lower weight?

Should I not squat for a few days/weeks?

Are there some specific stretches I can/should do?

Thanks! 




 Well, to paraphrase from Oscar Wilde: 

I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and changed an 'E' to an 'e'. In the afternoon I changed it back.

Really, that's how it happened. I wanted a smooth transition from the shaving gel to the knob to the mental fucking. Somehow, I felt it wasn't smooth till I capitalized the 'E'. Then I thought the capital 'E' was pretentious. Then again, I thought if pretentiousness is what it takes to get my message across, so be it :)

 




 Thank you! You said it much better than I could. 

With poems where I'm basically rearranging and adding makeup to my feelings on paper, I feel that punctuation only gets in the way of what I'm trying to say... 




 Espresso Royale is okay...Their self-named blend sucks, but the Guatemala and the Peru blends are quite good.

Columbia Street Roastery has a few good blends: The Escobar blend comes to mind. Needless to say, the coffee at Escobar is awesome!

Strange as it may seem, I prefer Caribou Coffee's blend from county market to all of the above! It's available in the coffee aisle by the pound. Best!

If you french press, you should try Aeropress... At least equally good and less mess to clean!
 




 And in the basement...quite nice there too. 









 As I came out of the shower  
I saw two bottles of shaving gel  

Next to each other by the sink  

Blue and Orange. And foam  
Between their mouths  

I dried myself and opened the door  

The knob turned slowly in my gentle hands  
Surely Erotic

I turned the lights off   
And for a moment  
Fucked you in my mind  

But I usually forget to turn the lights off  
So before getting out  
I turned them on again 




 Thank you Ma'am...that made my day and made me look forward to when I have a kid! 




 What do I need to buy now, to be able to run in the cold (10-20 F)? I run about 6-7 miles at a time.

Recommendations for tops, pants etc. all welcome! Thank you! 




 Ah...that's cool...Thanks! 




 The thread was very informative, thanks!

Seems like the tl;dr is that I'm still a beginner and am far away from causing problems with the amount of stuff I'm doing. 




 Yeah, that's what I thought...what does it mean to "allow" though, since Enterprise is open to everyone? 




 A prof told me I'm on the "unofficial waitlist" for a course. What does this mean and how does this work? 




 Thanks...that's exactly what I was hoping to hear! 




 Thanks..Hadn't even thought about that! 




 I put on 35 lbs on either side of the deadlift instead of 25 by mistake. So I was lifting 205 instead of 195.

Man, those 8 reps were painful! My face was contorted like cooked spaghetti... 

But I got through them!! And only when I was reracking the weights did I notice.

Victory by chance...but still a victory! 




 So I used to run long distance, but then stopped. I restarted, got up to 12 miles again, and then stopped again when I began the SS program, because I was told that running would interfere with my SS progress.

8 weeks in, my goals have changed:

I want to continue SS, but am no longer too worried about the numbers, as long as they go up somewhat (I'm still on Linear progression and haven't plateaued), but I would like to start running again and training to run really long distances on trails (50 miles or so).

I like SS, so I was wondering how I should modify it so that I can do running on rest days and still not hurt myself or make myself too weak to perform in the rest of my life!

Are there any diet modifications I should be making?

Details... Height 6 ft: Weight: 171 lbs.

Squats: 95 - 195 lbs   
BP: 70 - 115 lbs  
PC: 45 - 85 lbs  
OHP: 45 - 85 lbs  
Deadlift: 95 - 205 lbs   




 Oh I completely agree with this article.  Well, sort of.

I don't know about it becoming a movement and all, but I like thinking and clicking. Sometimes, I put the camera away and try to experience the sight BEFORE clicking away like a madman.

The experience comes first for me. Always. The experience of getting a good photograph because I thought about it comes next. 

Then I click away like the son of a madman and a tourist, and who knows...one of these random clicks turns out better than the one I thought about for an hour. But it's just not the same.

 




 Hello /r/photography,

I've been thinking and clicking away happily for a few years now and wanted some tips on the quick, bad world of snowboarding photography.

I'm going this weekend and wanted to get the best snaps I can. My camera (an old Nikon D40) is not particularly valuable any more, so I'm okay with it getting a little worse for the wear.

I have an ND filter to allow me to take some interesting things during the day... But any tips and tricks from you guys, some of whom I'm sure have done this before.

I'll be snowboarding AND taking pics of my friends...so no equipment or extra lenses other than the camera kit lenses this time for me! 




 Iron Post always has good live music on. 




 Don't know why you got downvoted :-/ but I chose to give you an upvote. 




 I'm on Starting Strength...Well, I thought I'd read the book...Shit. 

It's like a student reading a textbook with me! 




 Quick question: How much do you reset by?

For example, I got stuck at 195 lbs on Squat (did 2x5 + 1x4), so I went back down to 185 the next workout and then managed the 3x5 the the time after that.

Is that reasonable or should I reset by a smaller/bigger amount? 




 Oh I love that woman!! It was love at first sight -- the live video of her performing *Old Castle, by the River, in the Middle of a Forest live* (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=614eHycjJfw)

 Kind of like "terrible", wouldn't you say? 




 I was listening to Lush Life (the whole album) and I just lost myself in it...That stuff is gold! 




 Portrait in Jazz on repeat for today, Thanks!! 




 Man, that song is amazing!! 

This song made my morning...Thanks! 




 Could someone recommend for me a good piano jazz album? 

I am not looking for something like Hiromi or Chick Corea, which will keep me bouncing on my seat all through the album, but more like John Coltrane (but on the piano!). 

Music that I can listen to, chill and think. 

EDIT: Man, lots of suggestions here...Thanks a lot, guys! This is going to keep me occupied for months...exploring...relistening :D 









 So today evening, I plan to attend a jazz concert a bar, on my own with the hope of meeting someone interesting. Any tips on how to approach?

Never approached before. That's about it. 

I know that I should just do it and all that. But if that's too hard (and so far, it has been), any simple tips to help with all the tension? 




 That really scares me. Having conveniences would be good. But the peace that comes with the lack of these conveniences is far more important to me... 

There should be stores, but hopefully they will be far enough so you don't see their lights and hear their sounds, but close enough that you can drive there if you need something... 

But if I *had* to choose, I would choose no convenience close to where I go backpacking. Every time. 




 I agree..Really love the warm feeling from this picture, except for that glaring Sun in the top left corner.

But hey, it's the sun. When the sun's in the picture, it's on the sun's terms! 




 The title says it all...

I will be there with a friend.. Come along and bring yo' friends! 




 True that. All I'm saying is that you can't expect Science to prove/disprove God. God has to be believed/disbelieved on the basis of faith, which of course, not compatible with the Scientific method.

So you're exactly right. Science and religion don't mix. 









 Yup yup.. You said it better than me!  




 It doesn't disprove God. It can't disprove God. Because in Science, there is no god.

You can't disprove something that is unfalsifiable. 




 Man. Isn't it ironic that that subreddit doesn't exist? 




 Ooh. Makes perfect sense. 

Thanks and apologies! 




 True that. I looked for the "reddit" subreddit, and it doesn't exist any more...

Here's a question: Which subreddit would my post be relevant to? 




 I was hung up on one woman, and now I'm trying to open more social avenues, but can't seem to find any avenues.

Man, I need to get out of grad school. I'm old (relatively) and my friends are gone and there's nothing left 




 Because the right half will fall down, string, hammock and person included. 

The system "Hammock plus person" needs to be held up, not just the person. For this system, him holding up the hammock is an internal force, so it cannot produce acceleration.

You need an external force, i.e. the reaction force of a tree to counter the other external force - gravity in order for the hammock to not fall down.

More generally, you have to be self-reliant, but you have to know that sometimes you need help. 









 Sorry for the link the title...Umm Not a masta of the copy pasta, evidently!
