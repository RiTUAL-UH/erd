 You're original comment regarded the mass of the Earth being crushed into a black hole. That is what I was addressing. Are you debating a different point now?

Also this comment doesn't make sense out of context. What black hole is he talking about? Does it have an original size? Either way it doesn't really support your argument. He's saying that if a black hole was crushed it would have more gravitational pull. That would just extend it's event horizon, not change the force exerted on it.

Either way everything I said earlier is still relevant. The event horizon has the exact same force on every black hole. Being outside one of a small black hole will not put you under more gravitational strain than a large one. 




 If they hit pass by each other they will probably slingshot each other away. If not, there are black holes that actually orbit one another. If they come even closer though they will collide and from a single larger black hole. It would release an absolutely insane amount of energy. They would release huge gravitational waves into space. An event like his has never been observed before. 




 Oh, I understand what your saying, but the event horizon is a fixed point that has the exact same gravitational pull on every black hole. The event horizon on a big black hole is the same as one on a small one. That could only change if the singularity of a small black hole somehow had the mass of a large black hole, which is impossible. By definition they have already reached their smallest size.

Correct me if I'm wrong but here's what I understand you saying: an extremely small black hole would tear you apart before you reached it's event horizon because it's small size provides more distance between the furthest extent of its gravitational pull and the nearest. That's an interesting way to look at it, but it's not really the way it works.

An event horizon is the point where the gravity is strong enough to prevent light from escaping. The force of a large black hole at it's event horizon is exactly the same as one from a small black hole. And the gravitational pull extending outwards from the event horizon may extend further for a large one, but the ratio for distance away to gravitational pull is directly proportional, no matter how large or small the black hole. 




 That's a subject of considerable debate. Bear in mind that this is all theory, not law. We could never actually prove any of this.

Some say yes some say no. There are actually theories that if things could be sucked into a black hole and survive, they would remain there forever. So if I star could be sucked in, it could supernova itself and created another black hole within the first, and so on, and so on. An entire solar system could be created within a black hole, an entire galaxy, an entire universe. For all we know, our universe is inside of a black hole, which could be inside of another black hole and another. And many of the black holes around use could house their own universes and universes within them. This is one of the many multiverse theories. If it is true, it could even contain parallel universes. If there are an infinite number of universes, you could eventually find one that is exactly the same as the one we live in in every way. A parallel universe.

Black holes themselves are basically a product of dead stars. So if the universe didn't contain any stars before its conception, it couldn't have had any black holes. But who knows if there were stars when all of this happened?

Based on the Big Bang Theory though, nothing existed before, or at least not enough to create a star. Following that logic, black holes could not have been around. Our universe is not even old enough to see the first 'dead' black hole. The way black holes' radioactivity reduces as it's life goes on implies that they eventually fade into oblivion. We haven't even been around long enough to see one die though!

To answer your question, nobody knows, but there are plenty of theories. 




 Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think so up until that point. It would probably happen rather quickly though. 




 No it would actually be significantly more than that. How big would you consider a baseball? Ten inches around? That's about seven times more than the black hole you used in the event horizon calculator.

And you could absolutely not stand next to such an object without feeling considerable gravitational pull, but again you would most likely not be pulled  apart until you had passed the event horizon.

Think about it this way, you are feeling the mass of the entire Earth right now. Even if you were to tunnel down into the mantle of the Earth, it's gravitational force on you would not increase (in fact it would decrease but lets not go down that tangent). Your argument seems to be based off of Earth's consolidated mass creating a stronger pull, a pull that could effect you as you got closer to it. While it would eventually do that, it would not really happen until you were extremely close to it. 




 The two don't seem mutually exclusive. You could very well be spaghettified and then crushed! 




 It goes both ways... 




 [You're the best.] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/72dfc38636c9175f78dff498af34ea2f/tumblr_mqg385B0IR1qz581wo8_500.gif) 




 Oh yes, it would be like swimming against a much much stronger current. Once you go through the event horizon though, you fall off the waterfall at the end of the river. Even if you could overcome the current at this point, there is no getting back, not matter what. Unless you could go faster than the speed of light, but that the point where the laws of physics break down so lets not go there. 




 Think about it from the prospective that at any moment, all of your problems could be instantly destroyed and rendered meaningless! 




 An event horizon the size of a baseball would be absolutely tiny. So small in fact that while it could theoretically be created, it could not occur naturally. Anyhow, depending on it's exact specifications, it's gravitational pull probably wouldn't strongly extend all that far. You would probably break up someplace within the event horizon.

Gravitational pull doesn't increase as size decreases. 




 They probably don't all get their energy the same way, there are many ways it could happen though. When two things pass they each exert a gravitational force on one another. When an asteroid flys by Earth for example the Earth pulls it significantly closer but the asteroid also pulls the Earth very marginally off of it's orbit (we're talking immeasurably small distances here). If something went by a black hole it could get it moving extremely slowly the same way. And they usually don't have an orbit to stop them, once they're moving they don't stop. The bigger the object going by, the more it would move the black hole. If a moving black hole was to eventually pass by another object close to it's size (another black hole for example), they could slingshot each other flying into space at very high speeds. 




 No, the spaghettification doesn't happen until you pass through the event horizon regardless of the black holes size. I think that was what he was referring to by 'pulled apart'. 




 If **ANYTHING** even attached to you touches it, you're done. I saw an article or something that used a shoelace as an example. If so much as an aglet slipped through, there would be no escaping. 




 I don't think so, they don't each move at the same velocity. How could that happen if say two black holes were moving away from one another? Regardless, everything is moving. The galaxy the black hole is in for example be moving, so the black hole inside of it couldn't exactly just not move while staying in the same place within it.

Either way, the general theories of cosmology, which usually follows the big bang theory, prevent there from being a center to the universe. Even though it's all theoretical, I personally don't think there is one. 




 Sorry, where? This isn't easy on an iPhone.

EDIT: Fixed.
 




 I'm not exactly sure what you mean I guess. What is the difference between dying and ceasing to exist? I don't think it matters though, you certainly wouldn't live through it. A big black hole would pull you apart just as much as a small one. If anything it would even do it faster with its extra gravity. No one knows what would happen at the singularity, but you would probably be broken down into pieces so infinitely small that we couldn't even come up with a measurement for them.

I haven't read the article you're referring to though, I could be completely 100% wrong. 




 Absolutely, we're pretty safe though. The nearest black hole is about 6,000 light years away, not close enough to ever do any damage. Even the closest stars that could potentially go supernova are far enough away to be completely harmless. Personally, I'd love to see Betelgeuse explode, but that probably won't happen in my life. Or if its already happened, I probably won't be around to see it.

What's **really** scary though are rogue black holes. As the name would imply, rouge black holes don't have much of a fixed position. They wander around the galaxy aimlessly swallowing up anything in their path. Anything unfortunate to somehow resist a black hole's intense gravitaty and get close enough to touch it's event horizon would be immediately swallowed up never to be seen again. Well that's not exactly true I guess. Theoretically, you'll actually be able to see someone go into a black hole, or at least right up to the very edge of it. As gravity slows the speed of the image escaping though, it will appear the object getting sucked in will move towards the event horizon infinitely slowly until it almost stops moving completely. Eventually, the image will fade away long before it actually disappears into the black hole. Whats really happening that you can't see from the outside is called 'spaghettification'. I've just realized how much I wrote, anyone still reading please know this tangent has gone very far from 'black holes are terrifying'.

Anyhow, spaghettification is pretty much as bad as it sounds, and not nearly as delicious. As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be a single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole. Any theories regarding what happens at the singularity have very little to base off themselves off though, so its hard to know what happens next.

There are supposedly hundreds of rogue black holes bouncing around our galaxy. Although the methods of detection are getting better, they aren't perfect. A black hole could be flying at us right now and we wouldn't even know it. Personally, I'd rather have it that way. There is nothing we can do to stop or get out of the way of a black hole, so I'd rather not know it was coming than know inevitable spaghettification was looming around the corner.

TL;DR: Supermassive black holes=scary, rogue black holes=potential spegitification for the entire Earth (but probably not :) )

EDIT: Sorry about the rogue, rouge confusion, I'm on my phone, this isn't very easy to fix.

EDIT 2: It *is* rogue! I looked it up.

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold kindly stranger!

 Wtf dude you left by far the biggest spoiler uncovered.

 Woah, cleavage.

 Last comment I posted was "You know you're famous when your dick shows up on the front page in an hour and a half".

I'm so sorry Mr. Rogers... 




 Wow, you know you're famous when your dick to shows up on the front page of Reddit in an hour and a half. 




 ...you expected sarcasm. Sarcasm is what you expected. 




 If you're trying to come up with an example of one of their badly written songs, you've chosen a terrible one. What is this supposed to prove anyways? That your weak attempt at scat was somehow comparable?

If you actually take 20 seconds to understand the lyrics, its far from badly written. I'm not even sure why you'd need to take 20 seconds though, it's pretty easy to catch them as they go by. Around the World is definitely not my favorite, even a little overrated in my opinion, but still, not sure which point of yours this supposedly backs up.

Aside from all that, why judge a band solely off one characteristic? Even if you don't like the writing, the bass work is phenomenal, Flea is one of the best there's ever been and that's simply not debatable. The guitar has kind of been all over the place, but John Frusciante who played the majority of their albums was fantastic. The newer one is okay, but he's more of a filler now. Chad Smith is obviously awesome. Extremely talented, I honestly can't think of a bad thing about him. He brings a lot of order and direction to a band that's otherwise all over the place.

Apart from the performers, the production has always been done in precise minimalist taste by a number of talented producers. Rick Ruben, Danger Mouse, George Clinton, etc. All legends. Not many can say they've had a line up like that.

I could go on, but I won't. My point is, there are plenty of bands I don't like certain characteristics about. I don't let those few flaws ruin them for me though, instead I look past them to understand what really makes them great.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers have never been about the writing. In fact they've been known for *not* being about the writing. To say they suck because their songs are badly written is like saying Bob Dylan sucks because he has a boring voice. It's completely missing the point.

Again though, what point were you trying to make with the link?

 I used to have a teacher named Mr. Dangler. Mr. *Harold* Dangler. Yup. Harry Dangler. Unluckily for me, he was a second grade teacher so none of us understood how hilarious it was to have a teacher with a name like that. Anyhow I was walking by his desk when I saw something with his first name on it. "Congratulations, Harry!" or something. I couldn't hold in my giggles, this was second grade, knowing a teachers first name was a BIG deal. The next time he called on me in class, I made sure to address him as 'Sir Harry of Dangler'. We were putting on some mid evil play in class, this was perfect. Apparently when I said it he thought I understood the hilarity of his name and sent me straight to the principals office. As a newer principle, she couldn't understand how a second grader had come up with in insult like 'hairy dangler'. It probably made it a little worse when I told her I had seen it on his desk.

TL;DR: Called a teacher by his first name, got in trouble, probably go him involved in some sort of school investigation. 




 I'd rather just give you some recommendations than my favorites. You would probably like them better.

OutKast is kind of R Bish rap. [Ms. Jackson] (http://youtu.be/MYxAiK6VnXw) or [The Way You Move] (http://youtu.be/xI5NQ-0Ubfs) are both geeat.

The Heavy are awesome. Some kind of magical blend of soul, indie rock and even a little rap put together in one significantly underrated band. [Same Ol'] (http://youtu.be/4OAkUelXoVY), [How You Like Me Now?] (http://youtu.be/sVzvRsl4rEM)

Ever listen to the Beastie Boys? They're style is a little underproduced by today's standards (yes, I know, Rick Ruben. Still too 'acoustic' for today's audiences), but some of the newer mashups with them are awesome. Try [this one] (http://youtu.be/XL0YWTPDMUI) on for size.

Rage Against the Machine is probably my favorite rock-rap band. You may or may not have heard the hits, but [Guerrilla Radio] (http://youtu.be/H0kJLW2EwMg) and [Now Sleep in the Fire] (http://youtu.be/w211KOQ5BMI) are awesome too. Audio Slave is basically the same band with a different (and in my humble opinion better) singer, Chris Cornell. [Like a Stone] (http://youtu.be/7QU1nvuxaMA) isn't my favorite, but it's up there.

Redlight King is okay, he takes some pretty cool creative risks. A [Neil Young rap cover] (http://youtu.be/lGt54Ozo8LQ) for example. Not exactly a cover I guess, but still pretty cool.

How about early Snoop Dogg? Like Doggystyle early? [Murder Was the Case] (http://youtu.be/Do4fA8tONY4), [Doggy Dogg World] (http://youtu.be/En3IgstEmcU), [Gin and Juice] (http://youtu.be/0Cxr1-b6Xkc), etc. The whole album is awesome, somehow both ahead of it's time and nostalgic simultaneously. Probably my favorite by him.

I think you might like Sublime too. They have a cool chill style. [What I Got] (http://youtu.be/0Uc3ZrmhDN4) is good, [Santeria] (http://youtu.be/AEYN5w4T_aM) is better.

Bad Religion is probably one of the best-of not, *the* best-punk rock bands of all time. [American Jesus  (http://youtu.be/12kcpP-8jfM), and of course, the sacred [Los Angeles Is Burning] (http://youtu.be/BxoD9zWY9Rg). They even released a Christmas album a few years back. I would recommend it to anyone that loves punk and Christmas.

Wolfmother anyone? Awesome band, they're one of the last bands that play a lot of older classic rock styles. [Joker and the Theif] (http://youtu.be/3afXXsJwYZo) is definitely my favorite song of theirs. Literally everyone I've ever shown it to has liked it. And then theres [Woman] (http://youtu.be/GN7syX6tz18) obviously. Their entire last album was good too, 'New Crown'.

 Glad we could get an expert opinion on this one. 




 Drake/Jay Z. I don't understand how they got so far. Jay Z is okay, but he has absolutely no flow, it's like listening to someone read a book. And nothing else about him really stands out as above average. Drake is just...boring. He raps about cheesy shit that gets him radio time. "Started at the bottom now we here". Really? Such a lame line that somehow became so popular. I'm getting off topic. There's a few songs by both Drake and Jay Z that I like, but they're both insanely over rated. Countless rappers out there not getting any recognition could put them to shame. 




 I like to play with little things I'm holding. I can spin and twirl my keys like a true professional. I can flip and twist my phone in the air like it's an Olympic figure skater gently gliding over the ice. I just like to toss and catch the things I'm holding. I know where you think this going but trust me, it's worse. Anyhow, I had just got out of the shower and was brushing my teeth and combing my hair. Normal morning stuff. I picked up a little Axe spray bottle and did a few toss-flips. I then decided to do an extra high toss. It was ambitious, but I was feeling good about myself. I bent down and gently sent it upwards sailing towards the heavens. It spun just inches below the ceiling, a perfect throw. I readied myself for the decent, hand out, knees bend, eyes locked. This was it, this is why we play the game. The Axe was spinning too fast to attempt a right-side-up catch, I would just need to go for the hail mary. The unpredictable spinning reception. The bottle came back down to Earth with more force than ever. Two feet away. One foot. Six inches. Contact. The bottle hit my hand held directly in front of me. The force proved greater than I had anticipate. It was enough to press the specially designed Axe release valve down, and send a fine mist of deodorant directly into my open mouth. Try and picture how dumb that must have looked. Tossing a bottle up, catching it upside down, it sprays into my mouth at point blank range.

Which kinda sucks, because the space race is over, it's not a competition anymore.
