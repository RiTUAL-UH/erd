 Hi all,

just bought a new ASUS laptop running 64-bit Windows 8.

The problem is, I cannot connect to anything via ssh ftp sftp etc...

I've tried connecting to a few different servers using putty, winscp and fireftp all with the same result: "Network Error: Connection Timed Out"

I can't even connect to one of the websites I manage via the cpanel ui for the same reasons. 

I've ruled out router or ISP problems, as I can do all of these things on both my phone and old computer on the same ntwork.

I have also tried disabling Windows Firewall completely, but still get the same network error.

Very frustrated, any help would greatly be appreciated!  




 yeah, that sounds about right. 




 You know what? I call bullshit. Or at least gross over exaggeration. Or I am misunderstanding the full time college part.

168 hours in a week. You average 75 hours of work and 40 hours of school.

We're left with 53 hours for the week. 

You need 35 of those to sleep (5 hours/night). I suppose that you could crunch this down by going with some alternative sleep cycle, but I'm going to assume that if you work around 75 hours a week, you're schedule doesn't allow for it.

So now we have 18 hours left for the week. I figure, hey, you live decently close to school and work. Assuming that you have a day where you do not physically have to be at either of these places, you do not remain sedentary, we'll average a 15 minute one-way transit time. And that you are in transit for approximately 1 hour every day (to and from, to and from).

What remains is around 1 and a half hours of unscheduled time left in your day. Let's say the math is fuzzy and that you have 3 hours of unscheduled time. You need to do laundry, pay bills, eat, clean your house, buy groceries, get dressed, bathe etc. 

If that were you, you wouldn't be on reddit right now. 




 An insignificant amount 




 Hey, I do this too. But check it out, make some bread pudding every once in a while. Super easy, delicious and will impress people. You can even eat it hot or cold. 




 Seriously. A year is a political decade. Shit, in election years, 4 months is a political eternity. 




 Honest question:

Why would you use one of these image specific services when you can automate this entire task with something like grunt? 




 "striped" is an impossible color for single gallon of paint.

 The sous at my last job got this one dishwasher really good with "oh shit, go grab the gallon of striped paint downstairs!"

Poor kid came up twice asking what the can looked like before he figured it out.

The devilss!

 I really despise the word "ladybits". It's just the worst fucking thing ever.  




 Are you implying that young people do?!? 




 Was she a junky, or did she actually need it?

I mean, 20/30 mins out of a ten hour shift for something medical seems not like the worst thing in the world.  




 I actually think the modern bull terrier is a handsome dog. 




 Yes... it's just too two to 2 bad man. 




 I, too, am a lawyer and would be willing to take your case today!  




 Life, Oxidation, Fish, Insects. Wow. 









 "I hate this." 




 can confirm. source: i do this too. 




 where is the alliteration? 




 Well, as someone who gets drunk and does shit like this, I gotta know. What did you say to him? 




 the reddit dichotomy  




 That's bad 




 "Despite rumors to the contrary, the brown recluse spider has not established itself in California nor anywhere outside its native range.[5] Over the last century, occasional spiders have been intercepted in various states where they have no known established populations; these spiders may be transported fairly easily..."

According to wikipedia.  Do you live in the Midwest? Its my understanding that they need the climate of their native area to survive year round.

Cannot view article on my phone.  




 I have lived in multiple regions, east and west of the united states and here's one of the more interesting quirks I've learned.

Everybody is convinced that the Brown Recluse is native to their area. Not only that, but they're convinced that they know somebody that has been bitten by one. 




 yes please 




 Ah, here have an upvote for your efforts 




 You woudn't, by any chance, be one of the 'bean boys"? would you?

 I really liked this, and I'm much older than that. 




 That's something my old chef would've done. 




 I'M ANGRY 




 fake? 

As in there isn't an actually a chicken wearing a white crown riding a seagull?

Or that it may have been touched up because the photo didn't turn out as expected when holding a transparency up to a bird? 




 cats deserve ham from the fridge, duh. 




 I love... cake. 




 You could probably stop at the electricity part and just convince people that you were a wizard. 




 I would probably try to become and astrology/medium/profit shill. 

Not like, found a church, but try to work my way up to advise someone with a lot of power.

With a good foundation in logic and cursory knowledge in every little thing the modern world provides us information with, I would play off of the ignorance of the time and make it look like I was a gifted wise man. 




 this sub is my favorite 




  Is it worth a life? What about if it was your stuff? Your computer? Your car? Would you kill someone who was taking your entire life savings if you knew it was the only way of recovering it?

A computer is not equal to a car, but are very much similar compared to your entire life savings. 

None of which the young man was likely to be running away with.

But either way, the reason why none of this should be happening in the first place is that we operate under a justice system.

What's actually absurd is the fact that people go through such lengths to defend murder by means of vigilante justice. Because, no matter what position you take in terms of whether or not the store owner had the proper motivations, the store owner committed a murder. 

Even more, the store owner murdered a young man for what was presumably petty theft. So not only did the he murder someone, but his arbitrary punishment far outweighed the crime.

And further still, I seriously do not understand why people really want to reserve the right to shoot at fleeing burglars. One would think that it was a) bad to kill another human without the absolute necessity, and b) that absolute necessity requires extreme duress or life threatening danger.

So, no. It is in my mind never ok to blow someone's head off with a shotgun because they were taking property from you.  




 jesus, I've seen you everywhere today 




 they turned into super heros 




 why? 




 * China invented shit Europe didn't have to make porcelain cups
* Europeans thought that those cups were totally fucking rad
* some people said "brohonestly, I can't afford those cups."
* "well maybe I can interest you in these shittier cups that look the same."
* "ooh no, my cup broke... better add milk first."
* "lol look at that guy adding milk first, he can't even afford the good cups." 




 "lol bout to get shot #yolo #swagggg" 




 love it. make intricate dish, shove it into your face. 




 She might beat him in baking... who knows. 

But Ramsay studied under Marco Pierre White, pretty sure he'd win cooking. 




 Why? 




 No, let's pretend that we know something about junk and stuff 




 this was a misunderstanding, he thought I was selling bitcoin. 




 Anyone interested?

Looking to use coinguard for escrow service. 




 Here's how it is:

Are you ready to be a chef?

Absolutely fucking not.... but

Are you ready to be a line cook?

Fuck yeah dude! You will find your place depending on your current skill, general kitchen intelligence and aptitude for getting crushed on the line. If you are not confident in these last two qualities, you'll most likely find your self on the fry station. 

But don't fret! Thats good. If you work hard and are diligent about cleaning, putting out good plates and have a good attitude, you will find yourself getting more shifts and the opportunity to move to other stations. You'll also get an excellent idea of how that kitchen works, who the main guys are and any of the sous and actual chefs quirks.

Work there for *at least* a year, preferably two if you think its a good fit. If you absolutely hate working the oine after a year/year and a half. Theres your answer, no, chef career crossed off. 




 14xpm for 30usd, tried this earlier in the day and mixed up the numbers...

Anyone interested? 




 sorry, deleted the post... had the wrong amount.

 Getting tired of waiting for coinbase, anyone interested? 




 even better, this is exactly what I was looking for! 




 awesome, thanks. 




 I just found an ATI AMD Radeon HD 5770 for $45. I know it's not the best card for mining, but I'd like to start somewhere at relatively low cost. Does anyone have any suggestions for building something that I'd be able to improve upon slowly? 

As in, how much should I be looking to spend on a motherboard/cpu, and what exactly should I be looking for... I'm a bit overwhelmed, any help would be appreciated. 




 Alright 




 I'm now retarded from ordering a drink there. 




 This is a cool DIY project I guess... But you could get more than enough mugs/glasses with the money you paid for a bottle of something at the goodwill, or even walmart. 




 damn, very sexy. 




 with that kind of grammar, you'll fit right in flipping burgers. 




 lol, he's one of these comment trollers, check out his comment history. His favorite method of getting downvotes seems to be by denigrating people with the word  "retard", followed by the sprinkling of misogynist comments and the use of other ideas that go against the reddit "PC".  




 So, it's not about suing him... but she/he is pretty much guaranteed to get unemployment, right?  




 But wait...

It was aule's creation of the first dwarves that drove yavanna to ask for beings to represent her creations in middle earth. 

Bombadil is most likely a maiar, but treebeard was definitely created first before anything else walked beneath the sun in middle earth. 




 I believe everything you just said. So can you give insight as to what it would be like to walk on said "super earth"? 




 only in /r/geek are you going to get downvoted for this. 




 As embarrassing as it is, at one point it was my extensive knowledge of lord of the rings. 




 When I first saw the ring, I was terrified for MONTHS!

Then I watched it a few years ago with some friends thinking it would be a good scary movie. We ended up laughing through the whole thing. 




 very 




 Yup. I've seen so many people get fucked up from avocados and cheese. 




 I refuse! 




 Every time I watch that movie I just want to fall for Romona Flowers. 




 I laughed. 




 Please can someone explain this video? I am unable to watch D:D: 




 My mother was convinced that playing video games was evil. 




 I have experienced sleep paralysis for most of my life. When I first started to experience it, there were no visuals, just the inability to move. 

Now every once and a while when I get it, I open my eyes and see what looks like spiders crawling out of corners in the walls. It is slightly alarming, but I quickly realize what is happening. I've found that it's actually a great way to drift off and get into a lucid dream... I just kind of "succumb" to the paralysis, and just be aware that I'm dreaming. 

I've also had the feeling of shaking on the bed, like what's characterized in those "possession" type of horror movies. Which, needless to say, was *very* alarming the first time. 




 Awesome, thanks. It turns out I have a good buddy that lives there now, he was a little more optimistic than you... but I'm going to chance it! 




 I'm looking at taking a short trip to San Diego towards the end of Feb. I live in PDX, and just want to break up the winter. Really the number one thing I want to do is sit on a beach (don't really have to swim, but that would be excellent).

What are your guys opinions? I'm an east coast transplant and am silly and ignorant about the pacific ocean in general... Is it going to be too chilly to sit around on a beach towards the end of February? 

Thanks in advance for any input! 




 To be honest, in the first shop I ever developed, there is a comment at the very top of some javascript code that says:

/*
*I'm really sorry, this is a horrible mess.

*I know if you're reading this, you'll hate me, but I had to get it done.

*this comment is written in retrospect,  and can offer you no help, but know that my future self apologizes that this code happens to work.
