 4 months seems so long ago... 




  so after 7 days i couldn't hold out and took one from him. If i didn't have such ready access, I might just have made it.

My problem currently, it is too easy to have one.

i'm taking a different route that takes me through a couple of nearby office buildings where i cannot smoke.

Keep that routine, i'm sure it helps a lot.  




 If you ban SRD you might as well make celebrity gossip illegal.

You can literally create your own hug box echo chamber safe space whenever.

You haven't created any, you should try it sometime.

 Cigarette breaks were an intermittent part of my work day.

Every job i've had let me choose when to take my breaks, didn't even matter if i went out and have a quick smoke whenever i wanted.
I've never actually tried to quit. The longest i went without a smoke was 2 days after 15 years, and that was because i was in jail. 

I have a computer in my garage for i can smoke n surf the web. Just rearranged my room to fit my desk and computer in there earlier. Desk and computer are going in tomorrow and will try to quit cold turkey. I just happened to catch your post on /r/all/new and wanted to give you support. 

Might just have to quit now since seeing your post. 




 I must be part of a stereotype now, because i can't stand racism, bullshit, and lying. 

btw the smacks smell like justice. 




 If you feel like you need a cigarette, do something productive instead. Wish i had that will power.  




 Happy Bday 




 my /r/all page probably the first 100 posts are about fph.

Edit - now at least the first 200. 




 I'm actually AB+ and the only one in my immediate family. 

There was an article posted recently about being able to change A- or B- blood, can't find it atm but [this](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja5116088) i believe is what it was referencing. 




 I have been on the net 20 years, you get desensitized to the bad stuff overtime. I still can't look at things like the broken ankles that have been posted to /r/WTF recently. Doesn't mean it should be banned from the website. 




 I frequent /r/watchpeopledie only because i find it crazy how some people actually die. I'm not there because i enjoy watching people die, i watch because the craziness involved in the odd accidents. Kinda like /r/MorbidReality, even if it is sad some might find it interesting. Doesn't mean they jerk off to watching people die.  









 Never said i didn't believe you, i just think a suburb of the 12th largest city in the country could use more than 3 officers per shift. 




 They will just wait till it grows big enough to worry about, kinda like fph. 









 Wouldn't expect a suburb of a major city would only have 3 officers ~~employed~~ per shift. 









 Population of Beech Grove is just under 15k, would imagine all the towns drama happens at the local walmart.

 You wouldn't do anything to see the cubs win a series? I probably would just because i feel so bad for them. 




 He doesn't like someone on his favorite team? That's hilarious, thanks for the info.

 




 Who is this guy and why does he get mentioned in almost every thread? Sorry im kinda new around here. 




 This comment and /u/dcarr731's were posted 6 seconds apart, are you guys twins? 




 This post hit frontpage within 30 minutes. 




 Believe you are right. Will mark it solved after a few more hours.

 Normally a comment like this would be nuked from orbit, but it was my reaction as well. 



















 He walked away with no injuries and refused medical treatment.

 LA gear shoes were banned at my elementary and middle schools for being gang related. 




 That is what i thought as well, but why are they different sizes? 

At first thought they were those pens you get from conventions that have string to hang around your neck. 




 HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.

Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."

The good news here is that no one was hurt.

Couldn't agree more
 
























 Even if you respect bikers when you drive near them. 




 Even if he is right, just shows that this community and HOA have views that go against the grain. Yes it might be private property and they had every right to call the cops. The way it was handled was the opposite of what the nation saw as right. 

The blame really comes down to the original person to tweet out that there was a pool party. A young inexperienced promoter decides to turn a private pool party into a rave and have a DJ show up? Would seem most of the blame would be on the original graduate, that lives in that community, that invited a couple friends over against the rules of that community. 




 That green key symbol gives it away as a Honda easily.

 Guy then arrested Martinez and charged him with resisting arrest -- a charge that was later dropped. The sheriff's department then offered the family a turkey dinner with all the trimmings as an apology, but the family refused the offer.

 What about Salt Lake?

edit - found it

The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues.

 If the wings are one solid piece of carbon fiber, would that explain the rest of the fighter? The whole outer shell is one big carbon fiber skin?

 Traffic on the 5 can move at a fast pace. About 10 years ago i was driving north to see some friends. Had a corvette pass me doing about 100 so i sped up and just matched his pace. We probably went 50 miles at that speed, granted i had a radar detector and i guess he did as well. The vette crested a hill and immediately started to slow down, as soon as i crested i got a laser warning. After we were out of view we sped back up again.

I've even seen packs of 5+ cars being pulled over by a single CHP before. 




 Whatever drugs you are on, i want some. 




 I'm surprised they can't take the wings off. 




 I don't get to smell all the wonderful bbq though.
