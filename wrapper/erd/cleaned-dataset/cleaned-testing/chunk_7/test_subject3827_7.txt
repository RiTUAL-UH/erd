 TBH, I always thought that TPM was the most "Star Warsy" out of any of the prequels, in terms of setting, design, style, and tone. 




 JJ said he doesn't like it when movies do that - and I get that that's basically all that the Star Trek reboots were, but keep in mind that he A) didn't write those, B) had less creative control over those, and C) was never a big Trek fan.

Kasdan and Abrams are both competent writers, and I'm confident they know which direction to take the story in. 

We also have Kathleen Kennedy, who does her job of producer very well. We have an excellent cast, and I'm sure every other aspect of the movie is in very capable hands. 




 Wait, *Roger Christian* directed that? Famed creator of Black Angel (soon to be adapted into a feature film), and set decorator on A New Hope? Seriously? 




 The two trailers we've seen? The great director, screenwriters, and producers? The great cast? The possibility of being able to redeem the Star Wars franchise? 




 I know :( 




 So does the Empire's logo if you think about it..

 Actually, this sub is satire, FYI. 




 Because what you don't like is sorta the point of this whole subreddit. 




 Why are you on this sub? 




 George Lucas? 




 By September, the amount of hype will be the same if not more than TPM 




 Even earlier, possibly 




 Look through his comment history 




 Not according to the official synopsis of the movie released by Lucasfilm... 




 Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate....

 




 Eh, I don't think Universal and Spielberg would have much of a problem with it having a *cameo* (R2 did in Star Trek), but I think that would be a little stupid having it as a main character. 









 Back to the Future

The Empire Strikes Back

Aliens 




 Totally different style, characters, and ideas. Empire had meaning behind it, and was well written, while Trek was really just a cool action movie with a good cast. 




 Sorry to disappoint you, but Rogue One isn't a Rogue Squadron movie. Instead, it's about the group of Rebels that stole the Death Star plans in between RotS and ANH 




 16th 




 Why? That's a weird assumption to make off a pretty vague title. 




 Something tells me that little references like that will be scattered all over the new movies 









 Exactly - he enjoys it, and that's all it is. I *enjoy* eating a donut, but if I hear that there is some scandal involving the management at my local donut shop, I don't immediately go and interfere with people I don't know, have no emotional connection to, or really don't affect the quality of my donut. 




 Aww man it's like banana bread but better!

EDIT: okay, *just* as good as banana bread 




 General Grevious, probably 




 Super Mario Brothers. 

Oh wait that happened and it sucked. 




 I agree - this is the problem I have with movies like Man of Steel and Skyfall, not saying those were bad movies, but Superman and James Bond aren't really dark characters. 




 Yeah, definitely next friday 




 I'd love to try it 




 Honestly? I'll I care about is being able to get the same content. 




 Is this the end of reddit as we know it? Or will this all be forgotten about within a week? 




 Other than Star Wars, there's Bridge of Spies, Macbeth, Steve Jobs, The Good Dinosaur, The Revenant, Spectre, Creed, The Martian, Mission Impossible 5, and a lot more that I can't remember. 




 Im sure everything will be back to normal within the next week
 




 I agree 




 Episode VI wasn't directed by Lucas either  




 It wasn't GL who decided that, it was Disney 




 Star Wars - Episode VII: The Force Awakens

Star Wars - Episode VIII: An Ancient Fear

Star Wars - Episode IX: Rise of the Republic

Had a little trouble with the last one, as we really have no idea of where the series is going. 




 Hmm... Something tells me they wouldn't use any words that they've already used in previous titles, e.g. "New," "Sith" 




 You know what I find particularly ridiculous? Is that incredibly small subs, some with as little as 30 members, are shutting down. They have very little, if not nothing to do with this. It's a problem that should be left to the people involved, and maybe the major default subs. Why should the people who don't know what's going on be permitted from enjoying content on subs they want to be on? 




 That actually sounds pretty cool... 




 Fuck you Rick Berman!

All jokes aside though, I just think there's this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of having a dark movie, but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet. This kind of makes TDK look a little dull.

I get that they're good performances, but the character of Bruce Wayne has very little emotional depth. He's a shallow character, and his intentions can be very easily understood. Same goes for Alfred. 




 I see what you're saying 









 y 




 NX really needs to appeal to the Xbox and Playstation market - it has to have a proper controller, like the Wii U Pro, good third party support right from the start, and the specs of any other competing console. 




 Or the Nintendo Wiii 




 Seriously? You ask the question like its gonna be hard to find good movies from that time period.

Star Wars Trilogy

Jaws

The Godfather I and II

Alien

Rocky

Blade Runner

Apocalypse Now

Back to the Future

The Shining

Indiana Jones Trilogy

The Sting

Amadeus

Taxi Driver

The Elephant Man

Monty Python and the Holy Grail

 




 It's in the rules 




 Can't ask stuff like that dude. Could get banned. 




 Yea 




 The Star Wars fan base includes millions of people over the globe man - pretty big in terms of size and influence on popular culture 




 To be honest, I'm glad. I would be upset if Michael Keaton (JK Simmons too) only had a few great dramatic roles, and then went right back to stuff like a King Kong prequel. I want more Birdman and Whiplash! 




 Read about it man. I went, and it was incredible. It's not just a film, they've recreated scenes and sets right out of the movies, and everyone is in character. You can trade with people, have food and drink, and go on different quests to find things - if was fantastically well done, and very very fun. A must-go for any Star Wars fan. 




 I don't know what time zone you're in, but it's at 25 right now. 




 Have you seen the episode? It's the same model PEZ dispenser 




 You might be in trouble. Just went from 25 to a 26... 




 There're plenty of PG-13 movies that are the story the director wants to tell. A rating shouldn't automatically mean the movie isn't the best quality. 




 She made the point of how they keep changing the way you play their consoles, with styluses and WiiMotes, and how it goes against what you grew up with and what you loved.

Is she familiar with the idea of time moving forward? Of things changing? Of people innovating and doing something different? 




 It won't happen as a remake, but more likely a sequel or reboot - if anything, I can almost guarantee you that Colin Trevorrow will direct

 No problem 




 My personal favorite  




 Serious tag, man. 




 As a reminder, those bills are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. 




 But it doesn't need it  




 Stanley Kubrick's Lord of the Rings starring The Beatles 




 *Raiders* of the Lost Ark is the full title 




 Shelley Duvall in The Shining. Not *horrible*, considering Kubrick basically tortured her. 




 It's a toy. And don't start complaining saying Disney is going to ruin Star Wars with stuff like this, because similar merchandise existed way before the purchase of Lucasfilm. 




 Well obviously you haven't seen enough... It's hilarious, with a lot of memorable characters. 




 Look up Magic Leap 




 What do you mean? 




 It's similar to what HoloLens is, the idea of virtually altering your real environment 




 I guess so  




 Seinfeld is not popular? Dude, the series finale had 76 million viewers. That's like a third of the country.  




 I thought I read it was Borat 




 Just curious, but what would be an example of pretentious commentary?  




 Ripley is the better character, no offense.  




 Not when it turned out to be an actual thing - HoloLens, Magic Leap... 




 A DeLorean, Uranium, and a vest 




 There was an episode of the show where Karl essentially invents the concept of Augmented Reality, and both Ricky and Steve say it was the stupidest thing they've ever heard. 




 In the original movie I meant 




 Why? Because there wasn't a constant stream of action and dinosaurs? Because it developed the characters and story? 




 Yeah I guess so. I'm more expecting just a trailer than anything, this was only an idea.

By September, everything will have a "OHMYGOD LOOK ITS STAR WARS" kind of feel, once all the toys and new books and games come out. 




 I saw it in regular IMAX with Tomorrowland and that alone made up for all of the movies flaws 




 Newman!

Known on reddit as jake4545 




 Trust me, they do not. 




 It's not *that* crappy. You can still tell what it's supposed to say... 




 What about that comment above that you have 7 down votes for? 




 Why? 




 Spielberg as potential director maybe? 




 TIL you don't have any common sense in knowing that it is not a reboot 




 Why not? Up and Toy Story 3 did, and I'd argue that Inside Out is just as good as those. 




 Definitely - I think this is Michael Fassbender's Oscar year, whether it's for Steve Jobs or that. 




 Me and Earl and the Dying Girl? Inside Out? 




 Not gonna happen. 




 Buddy you won't find any way to read Star Wars until December. I bet you less than 8 people have actually read the script in its entirety. 




 He might've been the cloud guy? 




 I like them too - what's so wrong with them? 




 Definitely - whatever it is, it's gonna be big news 




 I would think Disney would want a high quality version of a trailer to be released as opposed to 15 low quality leaks. 




 Lenny and Carl 




 Jake fucking Lloyd was in the background at 26:59 waving his arms at the camera. Oh my gaaadddd. 




 How is it a reboot when 6+ characters are returning? And it takes place 30 years after the last movie? And is a sequel? And is referred to as Episode 7? And takes place in the same timeline as the other films?
