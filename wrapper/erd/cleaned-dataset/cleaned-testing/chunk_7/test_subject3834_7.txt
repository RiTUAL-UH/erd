 Yeah, in your case, you might be better off farming wolves in the orphinarium or whatever the hell the place is called (as the wolves have a higher drop rate than gargoyles) just to get the last few chunks you need to get your BB to +9.  You can probably obtain the chunks you need for that last upgrade in 30-60 minutes. 




 You don't belong here dude.  You need to be way more reactionary, cynical, and unnecessarily aggressive over the most inane shit, then defend your angry, insecure delusions till the bitter end.


Yep.  I turn 30 soon myself, and while I do get in and enjoy an occasional binge, my time isn't free, and it's definitely worth more than what it once was, and I'd prefer not to have to spend it mindlessly killing werewolves over and over so I can get this one last chunk to finish this upgrade so I can play competitively with a new weapon... but, ya know, fuckin casuls.


Let's have a bloodborne playdate sometime, and while we're busy with the important shit, maybe the old ladies can talk about shoes? 




 One useless line of text, and neither have you, or any number of the other numerous complaints in this post. 




 Hahaha.  Funy that you mention that.  I had actually taken that exact same screen shot awhile back when I accidentally found that angle.  Purely horrifying! 




 Shaman bone blade the maiden and laugh with glee as she gets raped by spiders wielding spiders as weapons! 




 Troll is troll? 




 I appreciate your sensibilities, and the fact that you didn't decry the changes as the end of the world.


The game is already limited in builds, PvP, diverity, replayability (since it is fairly short is easy), and opening it up a bit to reward players where it's due (chunks from bosses, etc), and to allow people to have fun with each other is just fine with me.  Plenty of people don't co-op at all, and just because it is available, it doesn't mean every new or inexperienced player is going to call in a level 200 toon to beat the cleric beast for them... 




 This game is already short and easy, and the PvP is severely limited and very samey due to a lack of builds, armor (that is more than fashion) and weapons (which brings creativity and more diversity).


A few changes to open the game up a bit isn't the end of the world.  Blood chunks were stupid anyhow - unless someone out there really enjoys mindlessly farming the same static mobs in the same location over and over?  At least we can see some more diversity as we hunt for them.  Having too few chunks available only limited the game more than it needed to be and already is (and weapons you could play with competitively on one of the four to five available builds). There is no reason that they shouldn't drop as rewards from bosses and be available at a high price.  Whether it was for the same reasons or not, FROM apparently agreed.


As for co-op, well, not everyone co-ops, and not everyone seeks to have a high level come in and kill their bosses for them.  The game has been out for a few months now, and plenty of people have already made plenty of progress or beaten the game, and if players don't really know anyone to set a password with, they are out of luck there anyhow.  It's not like you can give newbies +10 weapons and blood rocks, and just because they made a wide range of co-op possible, it doesn't mean everyone will be rushing to have a level 100-300 beat the Cleric Beast for them.


As for the PvP, well, it's already very limited, and most fights feel fairly same-ish, as we only have four or five builds to really choose from.  Invasions were already put on the back-burner in this game via the mechanics FROM chose and intentionally put in the game:  clearly they wanted red invaders to be at a disadvantage (unlike every souls game in the past), and they wanted to give them a real challenge, at least, more so than griefing PvE players.  The crux of the problem here is they gave us no better alternatives a la covenants that are worth a damn, arenas, and in general, more PvP and multiplayer options.  This was a real step backwards imo, and aside the general lack of diversity and builds in the game, this is the biggest thing limiting the game at present, and as other people said, aside some major over-hauls, I don't see how they can fix it. 




 Both you and Hydrall make some great points.  Whoever downvoted you had no good reason to do so, especially since you said what you said so matter of factly and friendly.


BB's covenants are shallow and lacking, the PvE is very well designed, but also very short, it needs more multi-player features, and in general, between the lack of armor (and armor actually having function as much as fashion) and weapons, and thus creativity and variety, I really do believe that BB will have a much short shelf-life.  


I put BB down for a bit and started playing SOFS a few weeks ago myself (along with vanilla to play with my brother), whereas, when DaS1 and DaS2, I couldn't put those down or play another game for a minimum of four to six months, and even then, I'd always come back for more PvE, PvP, and to try some new builds and ideas, like I couldn't get enough, compared to BB, where I have already made all the builds available, beaten the game+chalices with each toon, PvPd with them, and already sort of been sated, as it all feels so samey.

BB is a master-piece to be sure, and the story is cool as shit, and the mechanics are tight, it's just not the best game FROM has made, specifically when it comes to multi-player :/  




 And I agree with you there, though it makes co-op more player friendly in general.  If someone were to ask me to help, I'd just use an un-upgraded weapon to level the field :D 




 Wow.  So much cynacism and gloom and doom here.  Just because you hold an opinion about the reasons behind the game changes, or anything else, keep in mind that IT IS possible that FROM made these changes for reasons other than what you assume.


I keep seeing comments like:


*"This is the end of the series,"* but BB was already a short and easy game in the first place (easier than any of the past games).  And it definitely needs some tweaks to have more longevity.


*"The PvP is now ruined and totally unfair,"* As if us red invaders and our PvP builds and practice were ever fair to us griefing what usually winds up as PvE hosts in the first place?  Didn't FROM already make it clear that they didn't want red invaders to have it easy at all in this game by way of the game mechanics themselves?  And didn't FROM make it clear that they didn't want invasions (host griefing, usually favoring the PvP build invader) to be the focus?  The biggest problem here in lou of the former, is that they gave us no better alternative, and what they are missing is a non-penalized PvP option such as unique bells, arenas, more useful covenants, as well as some sort of PvP option without the health nerf.


*"FROM is caturing to teh casuls."*  Maybe.  Or maybe they thought they made some bad decisions in the first place?  Maybe blood chunk farming is a boring and redundant time-sink and shitty design, and they realized that chunks could be as good a reward as anything else in a chalice dungeon?  Maybe they never intended for certain things to work out certain ways in the first place, and they are now fixing what they see as problems and mistakes.  It doesn't mean "the casuls won the day."


The point is, this game has its problems, but they existed long before any of these patches, and just because FROM makes a decision to change something in their game that they have a right to, it doesn't mean that the elite circle-jerk has lost and the casuls win.  IMO, the game's lognevity is already severely limited by many factors, and it will take more than a few minor changes to give it the oompf it needs to really stand up as a good and long-lasting multi-player FROM game. 




 If you want to PvP (and mostly fairly), there are plenty of options in this game, and there is no reason for you to not find it.  If you were looking for invasions though, ie., the easy griefing of hosts, it seems like FROM already made it clear through their game design that they didn't want that to be the focus of PvP in this game (or much decent PvP in general, for that matter).


To me, it seems like FROM made it clear that they didn't want this game to be as much about griefing players with red invaders as the previous titles, hence bell-maidens only spawn statically in a few locations, when you invade you get a health nerf, and if you invade other places that don't have bell-maidens, then you will most likely be fighting a 2 v. 1 battle along with your health nerf.  


To me it just seemed like FROM's way of saying, "fuck you red invaders - have a real challenge." 




 This game is great and all, but it was easy and short in the first place - and now they added a mechanic so friends can co-op easier with their friends and multi-player in this game has been pretty clunky and shitty most of the time (though the previous patch helped a bit), more than anything else in FROM's series, even more obnoxious than SM at times.  If anything, these options are even more important for a game like BB that is already lacking in variety and replayability.  I don't understand why you are so cynical about all this, and why everything they have done is somehow catering to casuls.  


How about a different side of your personal mind-set and opinion, that maybe FROM thought they made a mistake by making blood chunks a boring grind or redundant by burning through NG cycles to aquire?  Maybe they wanted people with friends to be able to play with their other friends?  Maybe they regretted some of their decisions and ideas?  Maybe they want to keep changing the game to make it better in their eyes? 




 Whoa.  Why so cynical? 




 I thought PvP happened regardless of preset passwords, and even though people have gone back and forth to figure the level ranges out, I thought it was sitll determined by some sort of +/- level range factor?


Edit:  or is this something about the covenant mechanics? 




 Best way is to probably post/offer your services here and on the hunter's bell, that way people can summon you with an agreed upon password :D 




 Hmmm, in the OP IW said he checked for chunks after killing the cleric beast in NG+, but nothing was available.  


Someone else just said "blood chunks are available to buy after defeating One Reborn. Just tested this on NG+ " 




 Yeah.  I had a pwmf22gu open last night to which I had already killed the first boss.  I cleared the second boss, but I don't think I got anything other than a blood gem, BUT, I did clear the pthumerian elder on the 3rd layer and he dropped 2 chunks along with a blood gem. 




 There is a messenger bath vendor (just like the blood echo shop) right outside the hunter's cabin, through the side door in between the stairway entrance, and the entrance that loops around next to all the chalice gravestones. 




 You call me hypocritical?  Because this is pretty funny at this point:  For not reading my replies, you sure are angry about them.  Keep it up, cuz at this rate, along with the #1 businessman sticker or whatever trophy you received, at this rate you'll get the "Internet Asshole of the Day Award."  You just have to keep acting like a totally irrational, dishonest, disingenuous dick-head that refuses to listen to logic or reason or provide a cogent response.  Go on, I'll say it for you:  *la la la, I can't hear you, I'm not listening, la la la* 




 No, that's not necessarily what I meant or what I meant to imply, but as far as game design goes, you do bring up interesting points, and I am always happy to hear when developers or players come up with new and unconventional or non-traditional ideas when it comes to 'upgrades' or character's powers and progression (scaling, horizontal progression, etc.), but I digress. Inconvenience might have not been the best word on my behalf, as I am all for working and earning rewards in any game.  Adding chunks to the chalice dungeon is brilliant in that regard, as I'd rather upgrades/items/rewards/etc in any game come from a hard and challenging encounter, rather than having to say, repeat the same action over and over again (ie, killing werewolves for chunks, as it is very basic and redundant).  Sure, chalice boss dungeons and chalices in general can be a bit redundant and mindless as well, but it still remains more rewarding than the former imo, as there is more adventure there, especially making uncharted and new dungeons.


As for purchasing chunks, well they helped compensate for that by making chunks so expensive, also, I'm not sure at what point they even become available in the game cycle, but it is surely fairly mid to late game, and again, it's not like they are cheap.  So even if you had all but beaten a new game cycle with a new character, taking into account other gear and insight items/armor you'd want to buy, at most you could only buy 4-10 chunks in one play-through, which isn't much, but it would depend on how you acquired and spent your insight, whether you did the chalices immediately or after the main game, and some other factors in there. 




 Cool.  Thanks for the info, and thanks for making and updating this post :D


Edit:  On a related note - do we know what triggers the insight vendors to start selling chunks? 




 So...having to beat the game multiple times on new-game plus cycles to experiment and play with new and different upgraded weapons, (one of the few and limited things that really brings some much needed variety in this game, especially on competitive levels and so forth) was some sort of great design idea to you?  Not only is it fairly redundant, but I like to believe that FROM realized they made a mistake there by making chunks so few and far in between.  I'm glad they at least made blood chunks expensive to be on par with their rarity, and I'm fine with blood rocks being so rare, but honestly, farming is busy work, and it is a lazy approach to game design in any game imo, and I like to think that game developers can find more creative and enjoyable methods for players to experience their games, methods that don't involve time-sink busy work.


To further expand on it, once you learn Bloodborne (it isn't hard, as it is a very short game), it isn't hard to make new characters, or continue on older ones, to beat the game all over again and farm all the chunks on each playthrough.  You can even obtain all static chunks in less than an hour, but the point remains that I think it was an over-sight to begin with, or at the least, I think FROM didn't realize it would be seen and experienced as such a bother or restriction in the first place, and at the very least, I'd like to believe that FROM realized there was no real *need* for this hindrance.  


The question is, what real value did it add to the game, other than an oddly imposed inconvenience?  Especially if you have multiple toons as many of us do - multiple toons who we ran through all the chalices with and optimized and so forth and already spent a lot of time farming chunks and gems with.  I bring this up for those of us who are and who were willing to put the time in to aquire the gear and upgrades, yet still thought the lack of chunks was a bad design choice, to offset the attempt to justify this argument as some sort of hardcore elite gamer vs. casul opinion.


 




 Wow.  How do you go about internet cynicism, specifically, reddit-grade-ass-hole cynicism so eloquently, politely, and concisely?  I need to work on that... 




 Yeah, I saw a few other posts here mentioning getting chunks and gems at the same time, which I think is pretty cool, but to be more specific than my initial post, I am just hoping they kept the original and systematic approach of radial gems from pthumeru, waning from Isz, etc, as it helps stream-line the farming process, and adds some method to it.  I don't really care much for farming anything in any game really, but it's nice to know where to go if players are looking for something in particular. 




 I was wondering the same thing.  If gem drops are now completely random, then it seems that this will be an annoyance since you will have to randomly farm randomness for completely random drops, rather than at least narrowing it down by farming specific chalice type bosses... 




 Looks like the insight bath vendor messengers show up even if you don't have 10 insight :D

Finally, that was a fairly stupid mechanic/idea. 




 Just checked this!  Awesome.  Finally, there is more of a use for insight!  Now we just need a better use for blood echoes :D 




 People down-voted your posts because you are being a total asshole about all this.  I said OP made a dick-move, and explained why I came to that opinion, and right away, you attack me with all manner of inane and irrelevant shit you pulled out of your asshole;  from claiming that I am a newbro, to calling me a vaati fanboi, ad nauseum.  Apparently OP believes he made a mistake too in some way, shape, or form, as he deleted his post.  What's that tell you?


And then you have the ovaries to throw the word straw-man at me?  You never once addressed what I said (aside adding in a few assumptions), and you instead attack me?  Fuck off with your stuck-up horse-shit that no one cares about and your irrelevant bull-shit.  If you act like an aggressive, socially inept basement dweller, surprise surprise when people assume you are just that.  


And not that your petty "newbro" bullshit matters, but yes, you are wrong.  I've been playing the souls series for many years now, and again with your asinine assumptions, what does that have to do with OP's original claim and my dissenting opinion?  Go find a post that OP hasn't deleted yet and jerk off to that you fucking jerk-off of an asshole. 




 Haha.  Well done. 




 Haha.  Just realized your comments were downvoted to hell.  That's what the community thinks of you, apparently. 




 Now who is being a dickhead?  And this is pretty funny, considering you're the one had the nerve to bring up the "community" to me.  Is this how you usually treat people in your community?  Because this immature, *I don't wanna hear it la-la-la I'm not listening* childish bull-shit is pretty goddamn immature and toxic.


Yes, isn't this community so nice - all the toxic assholes like you can get together and act the self-righteous and self-important, dicks for no reason at all, because, well, I guess you are just entitled to that.

So what are you, 14 years old?  La-la-la you're not listening?  Gonna go bitch and sulk with the other toxic assholes in this community?  And as soon as someone brings up something that you disagree with, you tell them they are fanboys and to fuck off, with no mature or cogent argument?  Yeah.  That's what i thought, and that's what I get for expecting more from socially inept troll's in their mother's basements...  




 Fair enough.  




 You might be right about half that.  The problem is, even if we put 99 in health, we can still get chumped the fuck out by 27% gems in Ludwig's and chikage in a few hits.  I don't think they thought all this out well enough to be honest :/


So, do you still have a link or name for whoever you were talking about saying that 150 was a good meta?  I mean, I still think it's a bit high, as you can be super versatile and have a lot of survivability, but like you said, PvP is fairly limited and all :/ 




 Wow. You must be one of the community founders, since you are bold enough to speak for it, and bold enough to assume to know what the hell I really think about all this. Of course credit should be given where credit is due, but some vague accusation doesn't constitute proof, proof which I have yet to see, because as it goes with a lot of people, there is a lot of conjecture in between what is given in the game, so go figure that a lot of people wind up with similar conclusions. As for your comment about IN4 Das2, I have no clue what you're talking about. The game was a great RPG, it just wasnt a great souls game, but that didnt make it any less fun. Miyazaki still directed it with B team doing the rest, but hey, yeah, fuck it. It's not a souls game because you said so, and you made it clear that you speak for the community, being an all pretentious, presumptuous and self-important prick about it. 


Edit:  To be clear of why I think what OP did is a dick-move (and I said dick-move, not that OP is in fact a total dick), is, he should have confronted Vaati about it first and foremost in private, rather than throwing open the soap-opera door.  Instead of screaming "I'm 99% sure Vaati ripped me off" right off the gate, he could have talked to him in private, or at least attempted to, and then made a decision from there.  As OP said, Vaati denied it, and if we take his word for it, than that means all of OP's accusations are for nothing.  Just think of this:  if your wife or girlfriend thought you were cheating on her, wouldn't you rather her confront you in private, and be emotionally mature human beings about it, or would you rather her kick in the door of yours and her's family reunion, screaming that she thinks you cheated on her?  Do you see where I am going with this?  OP acted the melodramatic house-wife who did the former, and the husband said, "no, I did not cheat on you," so now apparently the whole scene was made for what?  Attention?  Jealousy?  The demand for recognition?  I'll let you decide... 




 I do agree in giving credit where credit is due, but what I'm saying is, plenty of us posted and continue to post our lore theories and ideas (most of us without monetizing it) and I'm sure OP wound up at the same conclusions as a lot of us, with the rest being filled in by conjecture and what little room there is for originality and speculation.  I've been discussing the lore since release with others just like the OP, and there is a give and take and we definitely influence each other's ideas by said discussion, and plenty of us have wound up at similar conclusions or pointed out where we thought we were wrong or right, all without claiming pledgerism, but I get it. Vaati is an easy target, and OP got the attention and recognition he wanted, with little regard to any truth in the matter.  I still have yet to see any proof that OP was pladgerised, other than vagueries and the other givens that go hand in hand with discussion of a FROM game.  




 This has nothing to do with being a 'fanboi' as you so eloquently put it, rather that OP went about this like an asshole.  I would have said the same thing if he made claims against Terra, ENB, Davecontrol, silvermont, or anyone else.


Vaati is just one of many people who make decent videos about FROM's game lore.  Sure, he wasn't the first, but just because ENB did it 'first,' doesn't mean Vaati should be derided for it.  Shit happens all the time in any field, in any subject, on anything.  Vaati isn't even my favorite, but he does produce his videos to a higher quality than most, so I'll give him that.   




 Well said, especially because I have seen no other proof of actual plagiarism, other than the common references to in-game items and etc that are used by a lot of people.  Go figure that a linear game with a few pieces of cryptic lore start to sound the same and leave the same conclusions after awhile :/ 




 I just read your update.  You think Vaati unconsciously or consciously borrowed from your works?  I'm sure after days and weeks of reading reddit posts about the same game, the same items, and a lot of the same conclusions, you would never do the same thing to anyone else either, huh?


I don't buy it.


Edit:  Last thing I have to post here (I should have just done one long, thorough post, sorry for that), is that I find it funny that you say, "please don't make any knee-jerk reactions," which is pretty damn hypocritical, since it is exactly what your bold claim with little no no evidence here is.  Way to be a dick about all this. 




 This was a dick-move.  I agree with a lot of other posters here that you went about this like a brat.  You should have contacted Vaati personally, first and foremost, rather than post this for attention and recognition.  If Vaati didn't contact you, you could have warned him you would do this, and then mentioned that you already tried to contact him for a reasonable amount of time in your original post.  


This is a passive-aggressive, drama-inducing shit-fiesta.  What did you think was going to happen?  I think a lot of people are just sour on Vaati because he makes decent money doing what he does, and people say he is a band-wagoner, yet they couldn't do what he does, nor do they attempt to do so, but still they remain jealous, or they think that the original lore posters on FROM games in the souls series somehow hold a copyright on speculating and theory-crafting about the games/books/whatever that they love, as if they were the first ever to do so on a video game or movie or book or any other medium.  I get it that the souls series is unique, and thus, this seems more unique, but it's not new to the art world....

 




 Yeah - but it can infect you without even being hit by him, and drain your health super-quick, and if you're busy dodging, you can't even use an antidote in time.


The one-shot grab is a given, as it can kill a lot of higher levels in one-shot if there health is already low and they are already poisoned :D 




 Yeah - or we could stop using 27% damage gems on weapons :D


Some of the weapons are easy to make OP with minimal investment.  A LHB without 27% damage gems is still a powerhouse, and you can get it there before you even beat the game.


Edit:  But again - it's not a matter of it being like dark souls or not.  It's the same fact of the matter that there is little to no sacrifice or focus in your build once you really start pumping levels.  This is the same argument it has always been... 




 Aside loose structure points, general FROM lore interpretation of citing items and in-game descriptions that everyone does, and the Lovecraft quotation, the only other thing I've seen anyone on here mention as proof for OP's drama-inspiring claim is the "mensis school being ripped into the nightmare" idea, which to me was a natural conclusion. My point is - neither of your phrasing was original or what I would say is plagiarized, as such imagery fits naturally into such a violent and weird game. 


I bring this up, because I never read OP's thesis, but I have seen vaati's vidya, and before I read of any of this, the imagery I had in my head is one of the school ' ripped into the nightmare'. That is the natural picture I saw in my head and the exact word I thought of for it too - in some sort of poltergeist (when the house was sucked and ripped into another dimension) or crazy ritualistic fashion. If anything, a lot of the lore and speculation sounds similar, especially on the parts that are easier to agree on or figure out, and so far I see this as coincidental, especially because no one has given any actual example of plagiarism other than 'they sound similar at points.'  Go figure. A lot of us have been posting lore theories since day 1, and a lot of people and ideas posted before and after us sound similar or even the same. 


My question would be, for all the people who post long-winded videos and essays, how much of 'your' work has been influenced by other's ideas?  I'm sure there are plenty of ideas that were borrowed without being cited, even if it was an 'original' thought. 


Edit:  clarity n grammar 




 Poison becomes a bigger danger, specifically for the AIDS from the blood starved beast.  For dicks like him you can use blood cocktails to distract them, and things like oil urns and molotovs are helpful too.


As other posters have said, you can run past most enemies, which is a good idea provided you are stocked up on supplies.


Most of the bosses are actually quite easy in BB compared to DaS1 and 2 onebroing (agility sucks!), you just have to follow the mechanics and be patient.


Good luck.
 




 I do appreciate that Bloodborne is one of the few Cthulu/Lovecraft mythos related games with an actual Lovecraftian mechanic (insight vs. insanity/frenzy) in it, I just wish they would have made it a bit deeper and more useful :/ 




 There is actually fur growing out of them, it just hasn't poked through their layers of muscles and fat yet... ? 




 150 is really high though.  At that level, you don't really have to make much of a focused choice or sacrafice, as you pretty much have enough points to max (40-50) health, endurance, and two primary combat stats.... ie, arcane and dex, STR and Dex, Dex and BT etc.


Edit:  Aside my original toon who I just kept leveling due to having too many souls, my main toons/pvp'ers are all at level 98-110 though :) 




 I know I'm late to the party, and I agree with some of your points, but I think you overlooked the real reason and the most important reason that the chikage is even worth mentioning or using, is that it is based around a Bloodtinge build - one of all of four to five different build types available in the game.  Seriously, in terms of build and challenge options, this game is very lacking, and with how different the playstyle is on a Bloodtinge build is, it becomes important that we have chikage as a weapon and an option.


Aside the unique nature of the Chikage, the Bloodtinge build is the only build that can really utilize ranged weapons (namely Eve and repeating pistol) for consistant and decent damage, and no, I'm not counting the cannon with it's former 10 and now 12 bullet requirement, as you can get far more damage out of Eve with those same 10-12 bullets, and we won't even get into bone marrow ash.  Again - it opens up a different play-style, and to utilize it to its fullest (as with any build really), you have to do more than just spam R1, and it can involve a lot more micro-management, which can be fun.


The point is, as others have said, the Chikage with an appropriate BT build is a very different and fun playstyle compared to how similar the other builds can play, and this is important in a game with very few build options.  And for the record, my first toon was a STR build that was really fun to play, who settled with the versatility of the hunter's axe, as it was strong, and the movesets were great for crowd control and general damage.  I tried using the Kirkhammer, but between all the narrow hallways, wonky cameras on big bosses, and etc., I couldn't stand how the kirkhammer often took up most of my screen, and made it impossible to tell what was going on.  I wanted to like the wheel, but I just couldn't stand how slow it was and how short the reach is, even if it could be powered up and hit multiple times and etc.  My second build and one of my favorites was pure dex with the BoM/rifle spear/saw cleaver and finally BB as my primary weapon.  I love the burial blade moveset, but I hate that you have to pretty much beat the game, and then farm deep into chalices to really max it out with appropriate gems, compared to how early you can get Ludwig's Holy Blade, and how easy it is to get high damage on the axe or hammer or Ludwig's.  But my favorite build to date is a 25STR/50SKL quality type build who uses the OP Ludwig's for the hell of it sometimes when I want to roflstomp PvE/PvP, but primarily uses BB because it's pretty much my favorite weapon, and sometimes the BoM are fun too, because it is the only option we have for dual wielding blades in each hand.  (Worth noting, I didn't PvP much with my STR builds compared to how much I PvPd on my BT and dex builds, especially my dex builds.  Those are fun!)


It's not just the hype or over-ratedness of the weapon, it is just the simple fact that we only have four different builds available in this game (five, if you count quality).  Thanks for reading this :D 




 And people wonder why the term "slut" is a perjorative.  Dumb bitch asks him to fuck her, then fuck her in the ass, then give her a rusty trombone - then he complies, and she claims rape, after she already bragged about fucking all of her ex's friends and getting an STD... see where I am going with this?  It's also a matter of how it affects the woman's psyche, vs the lack of an effect on a man's psyche.  Very few women can be successful sluts, plus, being a stud takes some serious status or charm, but I digress.


The point is, the dude should probably raise his standards, even for a fuck-piece, and I hope this bitch gets what's coming to her... 




 These are all good points too.  I helped my brother get into DaS and DaS2 by co-oping a lot with him in his early to mid play-throughs, and before long, he was beating bosses and eventually the game itself, by himself, or with other summons.


Edit:  Keep in mind, you could always let your friend summon you, and you could use an un-upgraded weapon, and slowly chip away at the beast without killing the boss for him. 




 Eh, if he couldn't beat the asylum demon and never went back, I wonder about his longevity in this game as well, though I know for a lot of people, once they learn the mechanics and get over the initial difficulty hump, they get significantly better, and eventually these games become pretty easy.  However, if your friend in general lacks patience and intelligence, then I wouldn't count on that.


That being said, the cleric beast is pretty close to asylum demon in that he looks large and menacing, but he is a push-over - super-slow and stupid so as to be an appropriate first souls-type boss of the game.

He can focus on using oil urns and molotov cock-tails, or shooting the cleric beast in the head to trigger viscerals.  Other than that, your friend has to learn to dodge the heavily telegraphed swings and slams, and he has to learn to be patient, because that is the epitome of FROM's games.  You will be punished for being impatient and sloppy. 




 Yeah - if there was at least a bit more diversity in the layouts, the tilesets, the enemies, and even the bosses, I might have been more excited to grind them out on a few different characters, but they are pretty goddamn boring now after three toons, and soon a fourth on the way once I am done playing DaS2 (again).  I usually put a movie on my other monitor :D 




 With the limitations of builds, weapons and items in the game, the best you can do imo (aside low level runs or new toons) is limiting yourself in what weapon you use, or at least changing it up (I never used Ludwig's till my third or 4th build, and my gawd, that thing is a killer).  I do appreciate that playing the game through with different builds using different weapons does feel like a significantly different experience, but that seems to be about it.  


You could try something more odd like the wheel or stakedriver since you have a lot of STR, and couple it with the cannon, or you could try the quality-type cleavers, but other than that, don't expect much of a change in NG+.  


If anything, I'd suggest making an all around different build.  Go either dex or arcane or BT (which is actually quite fun for PvE). 




 WarSouls 40K Space Duneborne?  I love that game!  Would play it for sure! 




 Haha.  I remember reading that article over a year ago, and in the comments I left something to the effect of:


"I thought this was going to be a game review, not your goddamn personal existential crisis?  Go outside and play and get some sunshine dude." 




 ME's ending sucked big balls in major ways.  No idea what those assholes were thinking, as the ending went against everything that made the series great - the characters, the plot, the stories, the everything... so stupid  




 That patch is taking you hours to download?  Stay away from PvP please!  :P 




 That?  That was added, uh, to make the game truly terrifyinh?

*You'll go hollow...*

*shudders* 




 Sudoku* 




 Well, the community was split with SOFS' release, but I have seen plenty of signs and co-op action when I chose for SOFS.  I also went back to vanilla DaS2 to play with my brother, and I joined him in his play through on one of my old 800k SM builds.  We're now closer to 9million SM, and we've seen a lot of action in both invasions and co-op for the majority of our play through, so other than people not needing or wanting co-op, or maybe one of those odd SM brackets, I can't say I've had the same experience.  Even at such a higher SM now, I still see tons of summon signs in the usual places (Iron Keep, DLC bosses, King's gate, all the newb areas back at low SM, etc.).


It's probably your SM, your play time, or the community on the xbox. (I'm on PC). 




 Loved dual wielding maces and craftsman hammers, though the range sucks, and they are kinda suck for PvP, but they can wreck if you learn to utilize them for catching rolls and that forward step of the L2 powerstance.


That being said, I love dual wielding the black knight greatsword and majestic greatsword on my powerstance pyro build.


And honestly, pretty much every other weapon as well.  I love the heide knight swords, the sun swords, the shadow daggers, regular longswords, you name it! 




 I agree on soul memory.  Bad mechanic, to a point, but a lot of FROM fans like making multiple characters anyhow, and so that went on anyhow, or you could just back up and restore your toons.  The agape ring wasn't the best solution, but it would have been much better if they put it in the game off the bat.  I am going to be the first person ever to defend SM here for a moment, or at least say that I can see why they chose SM as a mechanic, as this game made it far easier to level higher than 100-150 metas, on top of having more stats and no useless stats, and what you got is a vast amount of options when it came to your builds.  It isn't as simple as comparing it to DaS1, as DaS2 added too many new stats and build options, which was pretty awesome.  To defend SM further I'd say, at least gave us lots of options with the different covenants and summon signs (loved the usefulness of the small sign), as well as the name engraved ring, which made most of the SM problems that interfere with co-op non-existent for me, at least.  Overall, SM has been and continues to be less of a problem to me than how shitty multi-player was in BB for the first month and a half of it being out.  Now it has been patched a bit, and I am already sated with the PvE, and bored with the lack of variety in PvP.  


Sure, you don't necessarily need a bunch of similar yet different skin weapons, but you can't say it doesn't matter, as fashion-shouls has engrossed people in these games since day one, and has done a lot to increase the shelf-life of FROM titles more than most people will admit.  As for BB, well, you have like, one OP-primary weapon for each of the four (maybe 5) build types, and a few lesser weapons to compliment that, which frankly, is shit for options.  Sure the design is great, but at this point I'd love some more clutter.  Please, give me some more weapons to test and play with and PvP with.  I'll agree, the clutter can be annoying, but over the years, I've tried a lot of those options, and found enough nuances and changes to say that a lot of it is warranted, especially when they have unique looks, reaches, and movesets (this being most important).  As much as I love the design of the weapons and armor in BB, less isn't more here.  More would have been better, even if every weapon wasn't as cool as the burial blade.


I definately agree on the lag being a consistent turn-off in FROM games, but that hasn't stopped me, and others (who PvP far more ravenously and frequently than me) from enjoying these games well past their base PvE games, and well past their primes (and what would have been any equivelant game's prime).  The problem is, there really isn't much of an alternative for these games out on the market.  Sure, there have been a few indie clone-likes and soul-esque influences popping up here and there, but in terms of fluid yet weighty combat, coupled with real risk-and-reward game-play and loss (and we won't even get into FROM's unique story-telling), the market is mostly flat and stagnant when it comes to challenging the player's mind as well as their skills in the unique way that FROM does.   




 Black Knight weapons are fire weapons in this game, so it would be best used with flame weapon as opposed to sunlight blade.  You'd be able to get much more AR out of it that way, since the weapon buff spells increase AR by a flat amount, plus a percentage of the elemental damage.  I'd suggest something with lightning inherently in it, such as the heide weapons, or find what other weapons get awesome damage with lightning infusions. 




 You're all the result of a bunch of retarded monkeys who had butt-sex with a fish-frog.  There!  Are you happy?! 




 Really?  A lot of FROM fans have posted quite a bit about it, how they are already back to playing Dark Souls 2 (myself included), especially when it comes to PvP.  I'll definitely be back to playing BB soon, but after making a few different PvP builds and taking them through the game (chalices included), and using them a bit for multiplayer, I already feel sated, whereas, with DaS1 and 2, I couldn't put them down for months on end, and here, a lot of us fans are already bored or sated with BB after a month and a half.  


I mean, the lack of weapons and armor that creates a lack of creativity and build variety, on top of shallow, pointless covenants really kills the replayability of the game imo.  I am just one of many to think and say that, and that's not even getting into the clunky-ass multiplayer system, the lame-ass limited invasion bell-maiden system, or the long loading screens.  I know the patches have helped a bit, but there is no way to make up for the fact that there are so few builds and challenge options, especially compared to DaS2.  Sure, a large group of people flock to the metas in these games anyhow, but I saw some crazy creative and fun builds and cosplays in DaS2, and continue to see more, whereas for BB, there are only a few weapons in the first palce (let alone versatile and powerful ones), and the primary OP metas are Ludwig's or BT builds, or the other three weapon options we have.  I mean, I can't even get annoyed at the meta in BB, because there are so few options.  That being said, the weapons and fashion that are there are great, but super limited.  The game in general made me think over the whole 'quality over quantity thing,' and at first, quality is very important, but for the longevity of not just the PvE but especially the PvP, quantity becomes pretty damn important, if not, just as important.  
 




 I'd say go for a onebro or other challenge run, though that might be a stark contrast/too hard/too frustrating coming from the unbearable heatness of bad-assery OP that is magic/hex in DaS2.


Honestly, I've played pretty much every base type of build in both PvE and PvP, and one of my favorite has been dual wielding.  Whether it's two maces, two swords, two rapiers, just in general, playing in powerstance is fun as fuck! 




 Eh, to be honest, after having played FROM's games for years, I found Bloodborne to be pretty damn easy, especially once I became accustomed to the quicker pace and mechanics.  I loved the original Dark Souls, but the reality is, the awesome level designs hid the fact that it is actually a pretty short game once you learn your way around, but so it goes with most games.  The same thing goes for Bloodborne, which was pretty dissapointing.  Dark Souls 2 was a bit more non-sensical yet straightforward in design, yet it still seems larger and more sprawling, though I don't know or care to know what the actual differences in size and length are, as I enjoyed each experience for what it was, and the best part is always discovering it for the first time.  It becomes pretty damn easy after that, once you know an area and a boss and their tricks.

As for BB, sure, there were a few tough spots, but I was able to kill most bosses in one or two goes, and even the cursed dungeons became trivial very quickly, all without the easy to OP Ludwig's.  
Even the NG+ cycles and lower depth challenges are pretty easy once you get used to them.  Sure, you can get punished easily, and playing carelessly will get you killed in any Souls games, but I think once your familiar with FROM's tropes, secrets, hiding places, etcs., they become quite easier in general.  That being said, between variety, creativity, and nuances of a lot of the weapons and armor, I found a lot more replay value in dark souls and DaS2 than I have in BB, which has been a total bummer, but it is still a masterpiece of a game :)


 




 I thought the closest break-point to 100 was like, 99 agility?  And the next one for more i-frames was 105?  Thanks in advance for your reply :) 




 I though the "el-em-en-o-pee" part of the alphabet was one complex letter :D 




 Dude... I was thinking this too, but you can imagine the depths of madness you would be peering into, attempting to discipher that thing?  It would be like reading the Necronomicon backwards on Friday the 13th after summoning forth Lord Cthulu!  




 LOL 




 Don't take Ambien too long before bed-time either, because then you wind up doing things, like dropping your phone in the toilet :D 




 So why'd you bother to respond at all then?  If you didnt read what i wrote, then you have no actual response for me, as the rest of what I wrote is more important than BB's clunky and limited matchmaking system. Sure, it works, but it working is no substitute or defense for it working well. That, and the fact that you can only invade/be invaded by default in all of three short portions of the game is still pretty lame. As for your reply in general,  it's a pretty dick-head way to go about things. To paraphrase - *'hey, I didn't read what you wrote cuz fuck you, but I am presuming to know what your thoughts, experiences, and opinions are, cuz I'm just that special of an asshole'*


Next time, don't bother, and don't tell me to chill.  And I ain't your fucking 'fam'. What are you, 14? 




 I agree, and at the same time, I don't think it would be altogether impossible for them either, they would probably just reach their sadism threshold much quicker than your ravenous FROM fan :D 




 Yep.  So many games make it nearly impossible for you to lose at all, and even if you do lose or die, BAM, one save/load screen later, you are right back where you were :D


And you were dead on about your above post - it's all about skill.  And that skill can be learned and honed, and it is all about that skill :D 




 But practice and patience and timing your skills with any of FROM's games will definitely improve your odds, and make you a better player intentionally or otherwise, and that process of learning and getting better (as deemed mandatory by the gameplay itself) is what has made FROM games so satisfying...  The point remains:  it is about skill.  The game itself will make you more skilled if you don't give up on it, whether you level up or not. 




 It's not just a lack of weapons, it's a lack of options and builds, and thus creativity and nuance.  The covenants are shit, the options are extremely limited for items and weapons and armor, and the multi-player bell system sucks in the first place (never mind the loading screens).  Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but there is a reason a lot of us have logged far more hours in the previous Souls games in PvE and especially PvP, yet we find ourselves already sated with Bloodborne.  It's a master-piece to be sure, but I didn't (couldn't really) put down any of the previous Souls games for months on end, and I found myself feeling done (for the moment) with Bloodborne in less than two months.  I know I'll be playing it more for sure, and definitely sooner rather than later, but the game is extremely lacking in so many options and diversity and challenges, period. 




 I really don't see them adding enough of a diversity in weapons and armor and gear (and thus creativity and nuance) to make the PvP feel any less samey.  Sure, it was fun at first, but I just don't think the items in game nor the mechanics and shallow covenants leave much room for multi-player (specifically PvP) longeviity  :(

(Hell, even I am already back to playing DaS2 :/) 




 To a degree, I agree, but at the same time, Bloodborne felt fairly easy to me, because once I became adjusted to the new mechanics, I was already accustomed and familiar with FROM's tropes, secrets, and methods.  Sure, there were a few surprises, but aside the defiled chalice and a few other select moments, in most ways, Bloodborne felt pretty damn easy to me, I was able to kill half to most of the bosses on my first or second try, and it was definitely easier than DaS and even a lot of DaS2 for me, and I didn't even use the easy to OP Ludwig's my first playthrough.  


I'm not bitching or complaining, as I love both games, but I am just providing your point with a counter-balance, as BB is extremely lacking when it comes to multi-player and PvP anyhow: never mind the stupid bell-system and the crap loading screens and connectivity problems, there are bigger issues with the shallow covenant system, a lack of invasions, and worst of all the immensely limited builds, not just in weapon choices and fashion, but also creativity and nuance.  A lot of the things you take issue with on DaS2 are the reasons why it made PVP so fun, and have such longeivity, and it is those same reasons that a lot of us are already bored with BB and back to playing DaS2.  Sure, BB is a masterpiece, but it just doesn't have the options for builds and challenge runs and diversity and multiplayer that the previous titles have.
 




 Give it time?  Bugs and health debuff and lack of invasion and bad multiplayer connectivity and shallow covenants and OP weaposn that can 2 shot an invader, etc aside, there is a very distinct lack of builds and options and thus creativity and nuance in this game, and it makes the PvP redundant and boring rather quickly.  I love this game to be sure, I've had some awesome PvP, and it has some of my favorite weapons and combat mechanics, and it is definitely the best game of 2015, but PvP sucks compared to previous souls games.  We've had time, and many players on this subreddit and elsewhere are already gone back to playing DaS2 :/ 




 Which is wierd, since M-Man was still director on DaS2, and he let B-team give us so many PvP options and nuances and covenants and etc :/ 




 I love this game, but with the lack of fashion and weapon options, and the resultant lack of nuances, creativity, and builds, I'd say nowhere near as much as the previous games.  Throw in the shitty multiplayer, the lack of PvP support, and the shallow covenants, and bam, I'm already back to plyaing DaS2, among a lot of other FROM fans.  Sure, I'll be back to play more bloodborne eventually, but in the meantime, I'm already bored with BB PvP :D


Worth noting, I sadly don't see any DLC being much of a remedy for this, unless they make some fairly major over-hauls to a lot of different things... 




 I agree for the most part, though I disagree with the lack of variety not being a major problem in Bloodborne.  It's not just a lack of variety in weapons and armor (fashion) in the game that is a problem, it's the lack of builds and nuances and creativity that results from that.  It is the reason I haven't been playing Bloodborne for the last few weeks (and the same goes for a lot of other people that have posted here and elsewhere).


The lack of variety is a problem, not just for the lack of builds that you can play with in PvE, but it is an even larger blow to the already shitty multiplayer and lack of PvP content.  Coupled with the shallow and near pointless covenant system, it sucks pretty bad.  I actually used a shit ton of variety of weapons on my first and subsequent playthrough in both DaS1 and DaS2, so to me, this lack of variety is a much bigger problem than you make it out to be, and it is the reason I am already sort of burnt out on Bloodborne, and back to playing Dark Souls 2.  


I loved Dark Souls 2.  It wasn't the best SOULS game, but it was the best RPG of the Souls games, and it had an awesome amount of fashion and other options, it was still the best game of 2014, it was still fun piecing together all the lore (though not as original and enigmatic as DeS/DaS, but so goes any trope once it isn't new and shiny any more), and it was and still is the best multiplayer experience in all the souls games for both PvE and PvP.  Surprisingly - coming back to DaS2 after BB makes me appreciate DaS2 even more, and BB just a bit less, though I still consider BB a masterpiece in mystery, horror, and an all around awesome FROM game.  Sure, I think BB has an amazing atmosphere, great design, etc., but there is a reason I played Dark Souls 1 and 2 far more than BB, and there is a reason I am back to playing DaS2 :)


edit:  stuff and junk 




 Sweet!  Now make a few more toons with different builds and take them through that quagmire of fun! :D 




 Problem is, FROM was just too damn good at what they did between weight and commitment/conservation of movement.  I swear, Dark Souls was one of the first, if not the first game I played where I *truly* felt like the weapons really had a worthwhile difference, not just in damage and mechanics, but namely their feel.  A spear felt like a spear, a hammer like a hammer, a sword like a sword, etc - and they have only made it better as time has gone on.  Pretty much every other game I play, most weapons feeel and play nearly exactly the same, and without the rest of the combat/endurance system's depth, it all just looks and feels like I am swinging around a wet noodle :D 




 Yep, and the only thing that really compares with the risk/reward, weighty feel and gameplay, and the satisfaction, are games with similar mechanics - and most of those were inspired by FROM in the first place :D


The rest of the games feel like Hello Kitty Island's Adventure :( 




 It kinda sucks actually.  You get ridiculous amounts of souls from NG+ cycles and the deeper chalice dungeons, and you wind up with nothing to spend them on :( 




 Whoa. They just got goth served.  




 Yep. It's funny that that's the standard FROM set for themselves. You'd be lucky to break 10-20 hours in a lot of games out there, and then seldom or never play them again because they become redundant or weren't that good in the first place. Don't get me wrong. 10-20 hours for most any game is fine with me, so long as it's top notch in terms of mehanics, story, etc, (depends on the type of game and multiplayer), but still, I can't help but be a little disappointed that there isn't as much variety and replayability in both PvE and PvP for bloodborne :| 




 Believable, but again, more like acquaintances and people you really like who you don't seem to see that often.  Sure, at 18, you might have been busy, or you might have been freshly graduated and unemployed and not in university yet, but did you really have intimate relationships with all 60 of those people?  Did you know all of them well?  Would any and all of them helped you move, or help you move dead bodies?  I'm talking about quality and depth over quantity.  Again, I have tens and hundreds of acquaintances (not talking social media), some I know well, some not so well, but as far as "friends" go, again, I reserve that for only the people I have intimate relationships with, people I've known longer than even a few years.  That sort of thing. 




 It's ok, you can just say it - PC gaming is better, for a zillion different reasons.  Never mind how stupid GFWL is and was on DaS1, the point remains, it is a better experience across the board, in software, hardware, and options and mods  :D 




 Right, but he does have a point on DaS being realesed on PC opening up FROM's games to a much wider audience, that in turn brought in a lot more money and fans for FROM, which made sales for DaS2, the DLCs, Bloodborne, and now SOFS what they are.  In short, I'd say, "it made a lot of people happy," but that sounds stupid as fuck, as you can't measure happiness with dollars :P 




 LOL.  I was thinking the same thing.  Realistically, how do you have 20 friends?  I attribute a lot of weight to the word, so 20 sounds high, because it takes a lot of time and energy and emotions to maintain honest, healthy relationships.  Sure, I have many aquaintences, but friends, those people who would be there to help me move bodies, those people who I can spend my time with rather than wasting such a precious resource, well, those are quite fewer in numbers :D
 




 I agree for sure, but I'll take quantity from FROM, as they seldom fail to deliver with the quality.  Bloodborne's awesome level design hid the fact that the game is super short, and it hid it very well.  There are tons of souls fans who are already sort of... dare I say, 'bored with the game', or at least taking breaks from it due to how limited it is in build variety, challenge run options, and multiplayer.  So long as they follow their previous forumlas for DLC (cut content for DaS1 that was completed, or the planned crowns trilogy for DaS2), it will be just fine.  Those DLC's fit, because they weren't just tacked on, they were already heaviliy rooted in the plots and premises.  Worth noting, lots of fans bitched about DaS2 for any number of reasons, some justified, some nit-picking, but they still had a lot of fun with the game and played it for hundreds and thousands of hours. 


The point is, for lots of FROM fans, they couldn't put down the Souls series games for months and years at a time, and not even two months past release, the same fans are already feeling done with BB because it is lacking in the many different options, covenants, and content the previous games have.  In this case, more is better.  Bring it on! 




 But it wasn't a planned expansion per se, it was content from the original game they had to scrap because they ran out of time, hence it fits so well, and is so fucking awesome.  It wasn't additional, it was just completed, and more of the same :D 




 Haha.  Yep.  I too bought a $400 Bloodborne player.  Sony is fortunate that it has such an awesome exclusive, as the multi-platforms are accessible to anyone, and from what I've played and heard, the other exclusives for PS4 have been crap, but it seems AAA gaming has been crap and stagnant for awhile now, which is why gamers welcomed the challenges and mysterious games that FROM offered, as they were actually being creative, original, and trying new things, which both the industry and the player's need.  Here's hoping for at least another exclusive or two to really make the PS4 shine.


My only (mostly only) complaint about BB is that it sucks how short the game is, though the awesome level design hides this fact well, and it also sucks that there really isn't much build, weapon, or armor varieties.  I was also bummed out in how they changed invasions/multi-player mechanics.  I'm already playing SOFS and falling in love all over again with DaS2, and I know I'll be back to play more Bloodborne, but I think back to DaS/Das2 and I couldn't put them down for months on end... 




 Especially when the nearest bonfire is so far away :( 




 Kitten Souls?  :3 




 You hit the nail on the head on pretty much everything worth mentioning.  And not just that difficulty is cool again, the challenge was welcome after so many crap indie and AAA games over the years that make it hard for you to lose period, and at the least, you just save and reload with no real consequence.  The industry was rife for some change in a different direction, and I feel like DeS/DaS was able to capitalize on it without even realizing what they were doing.  I'm not even going to mention how brilliant (intentional and otherwise) their story-telling is when it comes to the video game medium, as it uses the format in a way most games don't even consider.... can't wait for more :D 




 Yes, some bugs and glitches are almost expected, just like you can find typos in most any written text in a hard-copy book or online, but the product not working in the first place is the biggest fucking no-no! 




 What other people explained stands, and while it might just seem like invasions are a trolling and obnoxious mechanic (and so it often is), the reality is, it really adds a few more layers of excitement, fear, and the unknown to the game, deepening the game-play experience and atmosphere.  It helps keep you on your toes, weigh your decisions more, etc. :/ 




 Yep.  I'm already back to playing DaS2, both vanilla with my brother, and SoFS solo, and I gotta admit, what makes these games so fun is the massive amounts of builds and challenge runs available.  I will no doubt go back to playing Bloodborne from time to time for both PvE and PvP, but they are both very limited at the moment.  Bloodborne's awesome level design hides the fact that the game is actually quite short, and not really that large or sprawling, but what is there is 10/10 for sure.  What is truly lacking is diversity in builds and weapons, and thus options in both PvE and PvP, and it really hurts the fuckin game.  Aside some mind-blowing, game-changing DLC, I don't see there being any remedy for it, and I just don't see it having the same longevity as the Souls games.  Sadly, that's not even getting into the shallow, pointless covenants, the shitty connection and multiplayer issues, etc.


I'd rather FROM start on Bloodborne 2, DeS2, or anything else, rather than focusing on BB DLC, though a solid DLC release somewhere down the line would definitely be welcome :D

 




 Yeah, there are no worthwhile exclusives out for the PS4 at the moment, and triple A and big budget gaming has pretty much been shit the last few years, aside a few formulaic series of games (like Battlefield and CoD, but even those are pretty redundant and unoriginal at this point.  The point is, thank gosh for FROM. 




 At the right time?  That's an understatement. Between die-hard souls fans buying PS4's specifically for Bloodborne, and there being no worthwhile exclusives for the console in the first place, it sure was the right time.  That, and not to mention, big-budget gaming has been pretty much total shit as of late... 




 You sure your at the right doors?  Did you go to the king's gate instead of shrine?  Etc?
