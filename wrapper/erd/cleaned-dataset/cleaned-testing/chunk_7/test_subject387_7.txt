 It would make sense for them to be able to switch stance to hit their opponent's opening side. Rather, it seems like just train from one stance. 









 The constant squats and quadricep soreness from SL5x5 are taking a toll on my martial arts training, makes me slow and laggy.

Wanting to try something new. Anyone recommend? Hopefully something that includes arms as well. 









 And this sub doesn't like OC, what the hell? 




 no, lets not encourage flashTV circlejerking. 




 apophenia  




 Very nice. 




 I would have picked a better shot of the Arrow though. Preferably with a mask for a more updated look. 




 What does OC mean? 




 What does OC mean? 




 I love your banners, I think we should used one of them for the default sub banner. 




 What the hell is OC? 




 What makes a Gorilla, handsome, to humans?

EDIT: Oh, by girls, the article meant Japanese Girls. 




 YES, THANK YOU. Was that removed from the final cut?

I noticed that end of the trailer where Ted says "I think I want to sleep on a bed made of your voice" was placed at a different scene in the final cut of the movie as well. 




 "Hey did you see that blonde coach over there?"

"You mean the one with the nicest boob job money can buy?" 




 Very professional response. 




 The fucking automatic captions for this video are ridiculous:

 You're a Purple Belt in BJJ working towards Black and one of your co-workers asks you what belt you are to which you reply, "Purple." They reply, "Really? You've been training for 3-4 years and you're only a Purple? My 10 year old daughter has a Black Belt." 




 I saw a trailer of Ted 2 (that I cannot find on the internet) where Ted  and John are driving with Sam when a huge car accident happens behind them which ends up in (an explosion?) I believe. Sam then goes like "omg are they okay?" then Ted says, "Yeah they're fine, they're waving at us! They're giving us two thumbs up" or something along those lines.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

thank you. any english translation video? 




 Why are his arms so fucking long? 




 Why no legs? :( 

Other than that everything was perfect. Minato looks fucking epic 




 THIS. 




 I mean, can't you just delete them? 




 ...You still can't save your game in the middle of a battle. You've never been able to. I don't understand this one.

This. What the fuck is OP talking about? 




 The scene in The Flash (2014) where Barry Allen goes back to the past to save his mother from being murdered but ultimately chooses not to. 




 Ever tried any of the Mooto doboks? I just ordered one, they feel so breathable. 




 DANG, your school sells the Adidas Dobok for only $85? That's a really great deal. It goes for $120 at my dojang, $30 more for school embroidered name. 




 He didn't "break" Shamrock's arm exactly. He just inflicted so much damage to his arm that Shamrock couldn't continue the fight after the rest period following round 3.

Most of this fight was stand-up because of Shamrock's Ego. He claimed he could beat Le, a Champion Kickboxer, at his own game. 




 damn that'd be epic yo 




 I was being sarcastic. I've been on /r/MMA for awhile. We all know how downvotes work here. 




 Holy fuck that looked so dangerous. 




 Have you tried eating?

I laughed so fucking hard. Oh my jesus. 




 He beat Cung Le 




 Thank you. 




 What the actual fuck. 




 I'm 18   5'7", I'm still growing but I'm worried that doing gymnastics/tumbling will close my growth plates. The doctor said I could potentially reach 5'8", possibly taller so I want to optimize my growth as much as possible. Is there any scientific evidence or study that supports gymnastics/tumbling does not link to stunted growth? On the surface, it might have some truth as it seems many gymnasts aren't very tall.

I really want to learn how to be more acrobatic and do flips, aerials, roundoff back handsprings, etc. but I'd go against it if it means not growing any taller. 




 Gotta take into consideration that Cung is also a Taekwondo Black Belt. His kicking game is above average. 




 Would you fuck your mom? 




 What the hell? What's the reason for using a "Smaller" Octagon? 




 Fuck your downvotes 




 Was this in Pasadena?

 Karin and Sasuke's daughter and not Sakura's? Also, did Sakura   Sasuke ever get married   why did Sakura choose to take care of Sarada after Sasuke and her biological mother seemingly abandoned her? I was hoping someone could briefly give me some answers. 




 looked just like from the anime. thank you for the great coloring. 




 I thought Orange jumpsuits and headbands were mandatory. 




 Of course in my Ninjutsu school it's pretty much try to wear pants...

Wat.
 




 Wow I'm really out of the loop. Didn't know there was a Naruto Gaiden. Is it a manga or a spin-off anime series? 




 Very informative answer. Thank you very much. I wanted to buy a snazzy Uniform from my school so I can stop wearing the basic dobok you get at your first lesson. I've bought all my sparring gear from my Dojang but to get the Mooto Extera S5 Uniform (The same one my Master and his children wear along with the advanced students, minus the black trim of course) from them would cost $150 as opposed to buying it online for $99 on Amazon. If it was within a $20- maybe $30 price difference I would go to my Dojang to help support my school. But a $50 difference is out of my budget. I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but hopefully my master doesn't take it personally.

And yeah! I didn't think wearing a white collar dobok to training as a black belt would be a problem. But definitely keep it formal with the black trim for events such as gradings and competitions, etc. thanks for reconfirming my opinion.

If I may ask, what kind of Dobok do you sport?
 




 Would it be acceptable to continue wearing a White-Collar on occasion as a Black Belt?  




 Kakashi Gaiden...? 




 For all of you that're doubting that Boruto was using Chidori - you're not a true Naruto fan. That sound effect is exclusive to Chidori. 




 what's that vest from? 




 Eh, Kakashi could do that too around his age. 




 All those Victoria Secret Models are pretty tall though. 




 It was from Le's last UFC Fight. UFC Fight Night: Cung Le vs Michael Bisping. 




 I love you.  




 Fuck. 




 Good reply. 




 That makes sense, I've heard the same theory regarding white belts fading to black belts. In your dojang, are all colored belts limited to only the White V-neck? And is it considered informal for a Black Belt to wear a White V-Neck?

I don't want to spend a lot of money on quality white-collar uniforms if I can't wear them anymore as a Black Belt. 




 But did it send the opponent flying though? 









 That Hook Kick to set up a Spinning Back Fist was ingenious. The sweep was very smooth as well. I'm gonna miss watching Cung Le's fighting style. Guy loved his spin kicks. 









 Do you think it would be disrespectful for me to save a couple bucks by purchasing a quality Uniform on Amazon rather than through my dojang?

EDIT: A Quality "White-Collar" Uniform. Don't know why I'm getting downvoted. 




 Seems like it varies from dojang to dojang, but is the Black Collar traditionally only for Black Belts? 




 A fucked up areola to nipple ratio 




 It was just something I wanted him to keep in mind. Though good wrestling is a great way to close the distance to neutralize punches and kicks, I don't believe closing the distance/takedowns is/are taught in Judo. But thank you for the sarcasm. 




 Right after that he mentions

"She was already an exceptional competitor, which she still is today," said Morris. 

Which kind of contradicts the previous statement. 




 Fuck you guys, the armlock starts [here](https://youtu.be/u-nEbXZPGs8?t=88). You're welcome. 




 Kicking on the motion, nice. 




 A lot of Judo schools don't teach defense against punches or no-gi, though. They primarily focus on Olympic-Style Judo that primarily focuses on armlocks for submissions. 




 Yeah I loved her [thick ass.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f7/a1/9e/f7a19e5a4582ea4e5809bfb73467cd23.jpg) 




 I mean, if that happens then Arrow and Flash won't be connected anymore to an extent. And that's the beautiful thing, they *don't* have to be. 




 "It's just like the tornado! Only upside-down, and bigger... and *scarier*."

Oh, Barry.

 Canary wasn't stick thin. She had titties too.

EDIT: Not Laurel, Sara. 




 Caitlyn looks so sexy here. 




 That red doesn't look any brighter than the one in the banner. Have you seen the bright red that Future Flash has in the finale episode?

Makes me never want to get on a plane. 




 are there more tit pics from this set 




 Likely because Kishi never intended to make Naruto, Minato's Son in the first place. Plot no jutsu. 




 perfect aereolas and nipples 




 How did your dad react to that? 




 Robin's holotech won me over watching the pilot for the first time. Did he ever use it again in later episodes? I forget. 




 Don't act like the stereotype about the correlation between black people and crimes isn't remotely true, though. Let's be real, there's some shitheads in every ethnical group and culture but there's obviously a prominent amount of amongst Blacks than in others in comparison. Largely attributed to their history of growing up in poverty and in the ghetto and what not but that's still not a good excuse to be a shithead.

Sorry if I offended anyone unintentionally. 




 I have a hemorrhoid... on my ass, Stan. 









 ...considering kickboxing is already an aspect of MMA. 









 This guy really lost to fat ass Roy Nelson. What the hell. 




 isnt kickboxing alreadu a part of mma 




 implyying hw fighters are not in shape 




 Even styles that incorporate head punches (EX: ITF TKD) limit themselves in what kind of punches they do and how frequently they practice. Many of those fighters don't ever even learn proper punching mechanics. And by TMA's I mean styles such as variations of Karate and Taekwondo.

In many styles of Karate, the only punch that is practiced against a resisting opponent is the reverse punch which is the only punch that actually scores in Taekwondo.

Punching techniques are ridiculously limited when compared to styles such as Western Boxing, Muay Thai, or American Kickboxing.

Watching /u/LawrenceKenshin's videos of Karate   TKD practitioners enter Kickboxing-esque competition really shows how flawed and porous their punching technique is. 

Obviously, this does not apply to every practitioner but it seems like the majority of them out there have very bad punching. 

tl;dr: Is there a reason that many TMA's put much more emphasis on kicks than punches? 




 I keep hearing "[This style] is the most widely practiced martial art in  the world" with different styles substituting the brackets. So which is truly the most practiced style universally? 




 My favorite is "Martial Arts is a vehicle for developing your human potential." He quoted his old Taekwondo Master when he was promoted to 10th Planet Black Belt. 




 I wonder why he decided to keep it standing rather than follow up on the ground   pound. I guess that's just his way of saying he respects Shamrock's striking. I love how he smoothly turned his back and walked away from it after it swept him. 




 You've done Taekwondo? You seem knowledgable regarding it. 




 Who is that girl? 




 You make it sound as if "Olympic Wrestling" is it's own secret special style of wrestling or something. lol. 




 Great display of technique here by Le.  









 Okay, holy shit. So I was about 6 or 7 years old and I was just chilling in my parents' room by myself while everyone was out in the living room watching Spider-Man 2. My parents' room has a door that leads out to the backyard and while watching TV, a FUCKING RAT the size of my 4 year old cousin just scrams through the room and out into the hallway. I immediately follow after it and as it was passing I looked into the other rooms with doors open in the hallway to see if anyone else noticed it. 

It ran out into living room and went straight behind the big TV (the Big TV was right next to the entrance to the living room so it didn't have to travel far). I was freaking surprised that NO ONE NOTICED IT THOUGH. My mom, my aunts, and my cousin were chilling on the couch and no one noticed it.

I had my dad take a quick look behind the TV and we couldn't find anything. 12 years later and I'm still very positive that I saw something... I swear, it wasn't an "overactive imagination" or "I was seeing things" I SAW something. Something black. I'm not sure if it was a rat but it was pretty big.

My dad thought I was crazy and they still remember that too but I knew I saw something. I really wish I spoke up about it when I saw it... maybe I could've gotten another witness.

I still wonder where it went from time to time. 




 Miley Cyrus. 




 I always think someone is in the house with me, possibly a murderer when it's dark and I'm home alone. 




 Wow idk why, but the beginning of your post made me assume you were a girl.

"Sounds like **he**..."

Was the biggest plot twist. 




 This. Took me awhile before I could actually navigate for long periods of time. 




 That's what I thought! Thank you. Apparently all my friends refer to "The U.S. Open" for Surfing. Everyone talks about wanting to go to the beach for this year's "U.S. Open" wtf...

 i am 13... 




 Why can't I hear anything on this track? 




 What the fuck kind of classroom is this? No order. Just chaos. 




 I'm being overly sarcastic. Only dumbasses are this unreasonable. 




 You should never put your hands on a girl in a violent manner. 




 Do you think this is self-defense or could the guy have just avoided the fight by walking away? 




 Do you think he would've gotten away with "self-defense"? 

I mean he flipped a fucking girl. 




 "Equality" where women can hit men but men can't hit women. It's wrong to be hitting each other in the first place.
