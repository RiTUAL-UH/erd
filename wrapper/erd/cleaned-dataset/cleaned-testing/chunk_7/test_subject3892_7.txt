 Cringed at the line where he says, "...a few more concussions." Ugh. 

Good on him for knowing when to step away.  




 I'm actually really concerned for the dog.  




 Same thing happened in Golovkin-Geale. Of course, he also had that awkward four-minute round, tripped over a camera strap and was put down twice. Just not a good night right out of the gate for him.  




 Showed up to an interview a few minutes early, as one should. Ask to use the bathroom, as one does. This exact same thing happened to me. Scrubbed it with paper towels, but they shredded into little pieces on my black pants. Opted to wipe it off, but now had an apparent wet stain on my crotch. Ultimately just pretended it wasn't there because honestly, are they going to ask?

Didn't get the job anyway, probably because I peed my pants and tried to cover it up with soap and water.  




 During the very early days of hockey, you couldn't pass the puck forward. Only back passes were legal, and the original "puck" was actually a lacrosse ball cut in half.  




 Oh wow. I had no idea. Thank you.  




 Saw this image of a first edition copy of Robinson Crusoe and couldn't help but notice the obvious speech impediment in the title: http://i.imgur.com/LNO6q.jpg

All jokes aside, I'm genuinely curious as to why this is. Does anyone know? 




 Good Night Dark Knight 




 **Blood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy**

I've been wanting to read it for a while now. I'm about 20% in and so far I really dig it. I know it's not your typical novel with the way it's written and all, but the way he describes landscapes is absolutely incredible. I've even re-read a few of them out of absolute awe.  




 When he first joined the league I hated that I loved him (Penguins fan here). I mean, that sliding goal footage couldn't have been played more times during that one five-year run. 

But I'm a total Ovechkin fanboy and I'm not afraid to admit it. When the Pens got knocked out this year I found myself jumping on the Caps bandwagon, and not just because they were playing against the Rangers. 

I really hope Ovie gets his 'ship after all is said and done. I'd hate to see him go out without one.  




 Agreed. But hey, whatever gets the job done. Growing up, the smartest kid in the class was often the quietest one. Now as an adult, the biggest talker at work is full of the most crap. 




 Hah translation: "this is what my agent said for me." 




 Interesting. That first kid looks like he's not even 18.  




 Vladimir Poopin.  




 Crosby on food: "It's important to eat."

Crosby on water: "We need it to hydrate."

Crosby on ice: "It can be slippery."

The ever-vocal Sidney Crosby. Remember when his talking to the media was analyzed as much as his game? Some people just aren't talkers.  




 I Am Legend is one of my all-time favorites. Enjoy it. 

Side note: Also the first book I purchased on a Kindle.  




 True, and all valid points. I think it's easier to identify after a fight, more so than during one.  




 I'm actually pleasantly surprised people didn't downvote this post to oblivion simply out of spite. Well done, peeps. 

1.5 years, 1 link karma. I don't do the Reddits good.  




 Boxing, to me, is an even exchange of connects while also consciously playing a defensive game as well. My perception of out-boxing is if the one guy is connecting more AND making the other guy miss, then he's outboxing him - because he's landing more punches AND staying on the defensive. A lot of times it's about controlling the flow of the fight and altering the other guy's entire game plan. May-Pac, for example, or Rigondeaux vs. anyone (Agbeko comes to mind, where he literally out-boxed to the point of only getting hit under 50 times). 

This is not to be mistaken for brawling, where both guys throw all caution to the wind and just go balls to the walls (Hagler-Hearns). 

Just my two cents.  




 Somewhat related: Apparently he had a really high-pitched voice, although based on the comments in the reddit post this was likely due to the recording equipment at the time.

 You basically defined my entire life trying to get a word in at Christmas dinner.

OK, not my entire life, but from about 18 on when I stopped sounding like a five-year-old girl.  




 Good job Katie. I admire your courage to go in front of a camera and talk about what you love. I know I'm pretty camera shy, so I definitely give thumbs up for that. 

Thanks for the posts and I look forward to more.
 




 Why the hell would you even say that? 




 Don't worry, a few seconds after this gif you'll be partying with a few skanks that "taste lahk seeguhrets."
