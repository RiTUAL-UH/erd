I was thinking of upgrading my GPU or my RAM and I don't really wanna spend more than $150

What would give me the most bang for my buck? Or do you think that saving money for steam summer sale would be a better use of my money? I can run most games a high but it cuts pretty close and with games improving so much I fear that my old PC will fall behind. 




 I have about 40 to 50 titles from the 70's I found in an attic seem to be "good" used by a kid condition.  I want to sell them. What do I do next? 




 This is either inspired or straight out of the game Skyrim, and that Armour is the glass set, not the elven set......... 




 That just got less adorable 




 DFW fight with gf 




 There is only one body per Primordial Serpents, and there are up to 8 different Primordial Serpents we know this because the dark lord ending (when you don't light the fire at the end) shows 8 serpents. The only ones we know the names of are Kingseeker Frampt and Darkstalker Kaathe.

Source: Played the shit out of the game and double checked theories using the wiki 




 I'd say like hot Sunny D and feels like an adrenaline shot. 




 damn she just told me. I feel sick. 




 Look for a brand name then call the company. 




 ASSUMING SO 




 tfw it was still fun
 




 OH SHIT BETTER DO WHAT HE SAYS 




 I am the sidebar

 I REFUSE TO HAVE TO KILL THAT POOR ANIMAL AGAIN 




 They defiantly don't. 




 Fucking cuddle her right now or so help me 




 Thanks for the help man! 




 Specs:

-Win 7 64 bit

-gtx650 GPU

-HDD 500GB

-8GB ram

-Turbo link 500watt PSU

-AMD FX CPU

When I press the power button it will turn on my fans and LEDs for just a second then nothing. I can only do this every once and a while (after second attempt of turning it on, nothing happens, but if I wait like 10mins it can switch back on again)

I found [this](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/345802-28-computer-turn-split) and it said it was the PSU, but I thought I would search for other opinions on reddit.

EDIT: I found this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FWXgQSokF4 about testing power supplys and wondered if it's worth trying. 




 Hey me too! 




 your own poop = satisfying

Poop found in public toilet = gross 




 copyright I'm guessing

 DFW the old friend who started doing drugs became distant years ago, but had a great conversation today

DFW evening on the couch with the GF watching our favorite show 









 *kind of* 




 "Then, the suspect proceeded to murder 87 people with a video game case"

took out the foot prints for a more artsy effect 




 The used? 




 "sorry" 




 The eyes on the right are a bit eerie, maybe add a pupil somehow? 




 You're a fucking hero. 




 "I should make a post on reddit where everyone is verbally trying to kill each other."

-OP 




 he will be the punishments of the me 









 DFW you turn that anger into motivation 




 Pardon? 




 [try here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrollsonline)

 I pity your pets 




 SOMETHING TOUCHED ME! 




 MY EMOTIONS!!! 




 wbkk?
 




 when I think grass

I usually don't think 90 degree angles 




 which is *way* better than "SALTY ASS-WHEELS"

It's all about hyphens. 




 Very detailed

not very accurate though 




 the sidebar can't even handle me right now 




 "HAHA WERE SO RANDOM AND FUNNY! LEL LOOK WERE EVEN HOLDING A PINEAPPLE. SO RANDOM LOLOLOL" 




 what's this style called?

btw great drawing 




 and he's in highschool 




 Yellow bike guy is my hero 




 I just did the same a few days ago

GOD DAMN IT ITCHES 




 DFW you realize you can fucking do it.

I finally did and she's amazing. 




 i have like 300+ hours plus in darksouls. Can't wait for number 2! 




 [None shall escape](http://imgur.com/TJuClOX) 




 I have heard a lot about deus Ex and Bioshock Infinite I think I will try those out (I have played/beat most of those other games a while ago) 




 This game sounds interesting. I will try it out
 




 I'm looking for something I can really get into. Some games  have really gotten into in the past are:

Skyrim

The Wolf Among Us

Fallout 3   New Vegas

The Witcher

bastion

so I'm really up for anything right now.
 




 [Loving it](http://i.imgur.com/OeKM2cS.jpg) 




 short for ruthless 




 **PUT SOME CLOTHES ON** 




 The story is kinda strange but if you're into animes like FMA:B or AoT then I think you'll love it, same goes for the gameplay. You get that feeling of being an overpowered badass fighting other overpowered badasses 




 is that a can of uno (like the card game) in pic two? 














 I don't belive you Mister "Swaggerpants420" 









  lubricity

this word is pretty
 




 The original artist based the art style off metal slug if anyone was wondering. 




 I'm really enjoying Metal Gear Rising: Revengance. 




 I know it is good for some people with mental illness to refrain from medication, but if this anxiousness continues you should maybe consider speaking to a specialist.

Also if you want my opinion; you should press charges. This is a serious thing and he may likely do this to you or another female again. I don't have a full idea of the situation, but I feel you will know what to do.

and if your afraid something will happen to you, consider going to be with someone who you feel safe around.  




 Preach brother. 




 That's a scary feel. I don't know if your situation is similar to what mine was, but seriously, just try. 




 You have the date down as the first... It releases on the 11th. 




 What are these called? I had one the other day and it freaked me out. It was oddly satisfying though. 




 I really don't think you are getting what he is referring to. Accusing someone who is bullied that it's their fault; not cool. 




 Jack Sparrow One-Man-Band 




 just think about bugs, that's what I do
also apparently eating dry food helps 




 Checking the translation it's probably Slovenian or Bosnian [here](http://translate.google.com/#auto/en/dodaj)

The date formats are the same Day/Month/Year [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country)

So yes, very soon! :D 




 spinach 




 Well she was there right after the first flame was lit.....
 




 no..... no it's not 




 PC SLIM 




 I'm as lost as you 




 We shall always consider you one of us, brother. 




 does anyone else get a sweet vibe from the awesome narration? 




 Wtf does gold do anyway 




 I think I would avoid that part, sounds sticky. 




 I agree she is delusional, but I don't think you needed to point out she's plus size. 




 maybe you should have worn clothes. 




 Frozone. 




 Is that confirmed? I feel like it's an unfair advantage for those servers. Do we have any advantages like that? 




 You have portal I recommend beating that then picking up portal 2 




 I head this just restarts you as a new level 1 Character with totally different stats and appearance.  




 I'd say around 750$ 




 Right now I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 and it kinda feels just above bare-minimum. So I was wondering what I should purchase for *next-gen* (or whatever you wanna call it) gaming. Should I go for a 6GB card or a 3GB card, or something else?

Edit: my budget is around $750 and I really don't have intention to use more than 2 monitors  




 buy a gym membership 




 this isn't the subreddit for this 




 /r/pcmasterrace would be nice 




 Umm, you need to specify what game you're wanting to play.......... 




 The sharp metal tip on the bottom and the axe blade makes me think it was a camp fire tool.

The tip used for adjusting the fire and the axe for wood cutting. 




 It's like that in NB today too 




 *pulls out apple* 




 777, I'd say buying arma 2 for a few friends 




 The serious tag is there for a reason. 




 The Oh Baby! 




 Not the movie but the show Hannibal.
Everyone is insane. 




  hobbit

ftfy 




 I love this style! Is there a name for it? That kind of scratchy/scribbley pen movement gives a cool effect, nice work. 




 why is it so bad?

 STEVE REPRESENT 




 My speculation is that the pygmy was the biggest part in creating the darksign, then was lost or died. The manus found his soul and became not just a sorcerer, but a very powerful *thing*. You do remove the darksign's curse *and* kill manus; removing all trace of the pygmy. 














 for big killings and for small killings
