 What movie to watch: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, The Town, Gangs of New York, or A Clockwork Orange. 

Thanks guys. 




 Solobek. 




 Birdman. 




 Django Unchained, I hated myself for waiting so long but wow. That movie was absolutely superb and made me one thousand times more excited for Tarantino's "The Hateful Eight".   




 That's ambitious.  




 Hm. Worded it wrong. Know the girl, don't know the guy that interfered. 









 Paul Blart: Mall Cop 









 Enfeebling curse and greater sprint. 




 As a final item yes, it is imperative to late game and will help you out tremendously in team fights with your ult. 




 My build goes: 

Warrior Tabi
Executioner
Hide of the Urchin 
Witchblade 
Runeforged Hammer 
Qin Sais 

I think this is the perfect balance of defense, damage, and attack speed. It is important to have attack speed on Vamana because if you buy a creeping curse you can just simply obliterate your enemies. Then hide of the urchin corresponds with Vamana's passive so well, and Runeforged converts protection to damage which adds on to that. Hope this helped.
 




 I am all about jump parties in smite where people jump up and down before minions spawn, it is just so fun and makes the game more fun. Nothing makes me more mad then when people are jumping and some asshole comes in gun's a blazing and initiates a fight, leading to betrayal and hatred. Please, respect the jump party...do not be THAT guy.
