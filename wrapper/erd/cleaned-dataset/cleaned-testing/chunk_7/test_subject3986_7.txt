 I actually returned back from Japan two months ago! I live in the US but was just there for a semester.

As for Kyoto, its a very beautiful city, which has LOTS of temples. They're all gorgeous, even the popular sights are worth seeing. Also, there are certain areas in town where geisha still "live" (they put on a show for the public) and its very rare to see one but if your timing is right then its honestly so intriguing to see them. Other than that, it was very safe and there was enough to do to keep me occupied, but I never saw nearly as much stuff that was in Osaka or Tokyo. But 11/10 I do recommend visiting :)  




 This happened waaay back, so I was very very new to cosplay and I was really uncomfortable so when I heard it was borderline hentai I was grossed out! Now that I'm a few years older, I dont find it as weird, because I know its a subculture and its peoples hobbies... But the 8th grade me was creeped out to the max  




 Its either creepy joker for males or sexy joker for females. Like really, just cosplay as harley quinn if you want to be sexy, dont ruin the joker for me!! 




 I would have loved to have someone sketch me/my character normally! But the staff members of this con said it was borderline hentai and my 8th grade mind was blown  




 Haha nah I'm in North Carolina! 




 I have had a previous experience in Kyoto at a temple with a man taking pictures of me, but my host dad came to my rescue!

And please be my Ryuuji 3 




 Here ya go! http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg

Sorry for the link, I'm on mobile 




 I only had a stuffed tiger with me :(   




 I always cosplay as Taiga Aisaka from Todadora! because I'm around her size. One day at a local convention, this really creepy guy dressed as the joker was following me and my friend (dressed as Korra) around to every single pannel we went to. We weren't too creeped out because it was a very small convention, but it got to be weird when he started sketching things on a sketchpad... He would sit directly behind us and keep sketching. Eventually things got so uncomfortable that we told the convention staff about the man who was following us... Needless to say, they didnt want to show us the drawings he did. And I REALLY dont want to find out either. 

EDIT: since people are wondering what my cosplay looks like, [here] (http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg) ya go 




 [CAUSE ITS DIE MOTHAFUCKA DIE MOTHAFUCKA STILL!!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF8c3BjFWsw) 




 I already sharpened it off BUT when I did examine it closely it looked like a thin coat of whiteness, and it did not appear to be fuzzy 




 I have the Rimmer Lasting Finish lipliner in 1000 Kisses, and today when I removed the top I saw it was coated in white. I have seen posts regarding lipstick sweat, but I didnt know if it was possible with a lipliner. I just sharpened my lip liner and carried on, but I dont know what this mysterious white substance is. Any verdicts?  




 (srs) but its still around?! I thought it was just a 2010 thing... This post made me look up AT and I found out they're still making episodes and now I'm like :o 




 Whenever I see someone with a FOTD that includes cashmere I cant help but think how their lips look like an dry asshole 




 I've stopped self posting and am only giving advice to people who have no comments on their CCW posts. My first post on MUA was admittingly basic (winged liner and red lipstick) but I wanted tips to improve my eyebrows and add dimension to my face, and I got a comment that said "stop being ugly and stop wearing the look that everyone else is" 

Honestly, i was so hurt. I deleted my post until i got enough courage to post again with a more "attractive" picture, but i STILL got no help... 

The people on MUA are toxic, they only give compliments to the people who are attractive and popular. Its such a shame that people could really improve their skills, but are buried in submissions of redundant negative space cut-creases and bold brows.  




 (srs) people still watch that show? wow 




 (srs) what was the second cosplay makeup? I'd scroll through MUA but there's literally 926381027 posts from the last 2 days 




 If you can't find any then maybe I could hook you up! There's about 10 poetica/monarch palettes and I'm positive they have ladybird and star struck. I hope you can find what youre looking for :)  




 Do you have a TJ Maxx in your area? Just got mine for $9 there! 




 Thanks for your opinion! Maybe of you would have read my previous comments you would have seen that it was one of my first attempts at a makeup. I appreciate your criticism but this is MY character, and I will represent them how I please. Plus, its creative. Sure, you may not like it, but its just a makeup for Valentines day. Seriously, I did it for fun, not for a movie. And by the way, you sound pretentious and off putting for commenting TWICE about how you dont like it. I get it. Now go away. 




 Reported for harassment. 




 How do I add dimension? I just started practicing a month ago so I'm trying to get all the tips I can get 




 Thanks! This was actually one of my first sfx makeups :) I was aiming for a morbidly ethereal cupid look, but I think I also may try out a more gory look too see how it contrasts. 

Thanks for the advice!
