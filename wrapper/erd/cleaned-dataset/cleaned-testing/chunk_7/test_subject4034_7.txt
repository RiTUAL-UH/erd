 I recently played a borrowed copy of NBA 2k11 and have gotten hooked into NBA games. I want to get one for my Xbox One but I'm not sure which one is better. 
Any opinions out there?

 Maybe that's what North Korea were doing. Just trying to send a letter to America.  




 I live in Australia and I am thinking about buying a Google Chromecast but I'm wondering if anyone owns one and what their opinions are about it and if it's worth picking up.
