 She did, actually, which, thinking about it, makes it even more creepey.  She moved from Nevada to Ohio to live with her sister. She never talked about it again that I know of, we sort "lost touch" after she moved, AKA my father thought she was insane and didn't really want her around or talking to us, even though he saw what we all did and just passed it off as an aggressive stray dog. 

She's actually still alive, but she's in her 90's now. I've thought about calling her before and asking about what happened more, but I don't want to cause her to have a heart attack or something o-o.  




 That's creepy o3o. I love the Navajo culture but I never got too deep into the spiritual side of things their lore and their beliefs etc. 

I did, however, forget one bit. 

Apparently, up until my grandmother moved. She called my mother several times in hysterics, saying that "Yenaldlooshi is outside" or she'd leave messages saying "I'm not safe here, I have to leave. I will talk to you soon"

I don't remember that, I had to ask my mom about it. My mom doesn't even like to talk about it. 

I do remember that apparently, several of my grandmothers neighbors also saw the same, large black dog over the course of several weeks.  




 I don't have any kind of video chat or anything, nor do I have skype, but I do wanna share this story. 

My grandmother on my mothers side has always been very Superstitious, for lack of better word, she's not religious, but she does believe in a lot of paranormal stuff. 


Her mother was full blooded Navajo and her father was Irish. Either way, she'd never been anywhere East of Montana and she grew up in Nevada. 

One year, when I was in Gradeschool, we went to visit her, most of the visit was pretty uneventful, typical boring old people stuff, except she always kept her curtains drawn shut and would always peek out the window and when someone asked what she was doing, she would simply reply " Yenaldlooshi is watching me" 

This went on for nearly the entire visit until a few days before we were due to leave, My grandma and my (then) baby brother (he's 19 now lol) were in the front yard that evening, planting flowers when all of a sudden, my grandmother starts shouting "*Insert little brothers name here* get away from that creature! It's not safe!" of course, being in Nevada, we all assumed that my brother had found a scorpion or a rattle snake, so we all run outside, to see my Grandmother clutching my little brother and shaking in terror against the side of the house, standing out in the yard, was a large,black, great-dane sized dog, it was staring at my grandmother with an intensity I'd never seen before. It looked up at us, gave a little huff and bounded off, I don't remember if it moved unusually fast or not, but  do remember it had really deep yellow eyes. 

When my mother asked my grandmother what had happened, she kept repeating " The Yenaldlooshi has found me". She moved a couple weeks after that.
