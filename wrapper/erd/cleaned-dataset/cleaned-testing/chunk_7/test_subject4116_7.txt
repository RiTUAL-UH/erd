 So rude... 




 This is how you write a story. Just sit tight and read that first paragraph -- really read it. Like, out loud, and just think on that for a second. Absolutely airtight, methodical, but beautiful. That's a storyteller. 









 Is it just me or does everything relate to work lately?

You can't leave your job, you'll starve. You can't stay where you are, it's got you contorted in ways that aren't natural. It's a lose-lose.

 Hey, I'm a major film producer and I'd like to turn this into a blockbuster motion picture.

Sorry, I'm not really. I just got tired of saying "I want to see that movie." 




 I like aliens. It's like nosleep up and forgot about them, but when I was a kid, those were some of the scariest stories. 




 That epic moment when everyone's standing around saying "someone should," and you realize that someone is you.

 That's a good Dad, right there. With a sixth sense for someone trying to harm your kid. 




 My partner comes out of the gas station bathroom around the corner. Jesus, I hope he washed his hands. This is what he does to me, though, makes me act like a worried mother. He's just a kid after all. 









 I set that up a while ago, so maybe I did and forgot. Awfully perceptive to notice that. 




 [Not exactly it](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/2ybfr0/senseless_violence/), but hey, I came through. 




 This story is my jam. 




 I was 13. Just a kid. Thats a tender age, you know? Impressionable. I didnt deserve to be around that kind of senseless violence.

My parents murdered my dog, Rex. Cold-blooded. It was because I spilled milk on my mothers nice tablecloth. I tried to wash it before they found out. I was a kid, so I didnt know better, but if you wash a white tablecloth with a new red shirt

I came home from school and Dad was still digging the hole. I thought the dog was sleeping in the shade of the tree, but he was covered in blood. It matted his yellow fur against his skin, making him look smaller and more pathetic than Id ever seen him.

*Outraged* when I turned a tablecloth pink, but my fathers shirt was splattered in red.

Not entirely sure what to do, I called the police.

Cops in small towns know the people in their neighborhoods. I went to school with the officers son, a fat, bratty slob who cried when he didnt get his way or when he lost in H.O.R.S.E.. The officer knew me, but worse, he knew my parents. He went bowling with my father every Saturday.

Damn thing bit me, said my father. ...Got this crazy look. Didnt even bark or growl, just chomped down on my leg.

Lies.

The police told him that he couldnt bury an animal in a residential backyard. That things didnt stay buried with how many scavengers there were around, and that hed need a permit to dig more than a few feet. And so Rexs body was taken away from me.

Something changed in me that day. I felt it in the way my heart beat when I lay in bed that night. The strong, strange new rhythm continued and it informed my dreaming mind. In the morning, I had a plan.

I went to school. I paid attention in class, dressed down in P.E.. I even raised my hand to read out loud, something no one did if they could help it.

That night at home, I offered to make dinner. Kraft Mac n Cheese from the box with hot dogs and ketchup in Dads because he liked it that way.

I didnt bark or growl, even. I just watched as they slid to the ground, yellow artificially-colored foam seeping from their mouths.

I got some plastic sheeting from the shed, and wrapped them up good so that they wouldnt start to stink, and then drug them down the hall to the big closet. Dad was heavy, and I had to take a break before I moved Mom.

When Dad had remodeled the house, hed accidentally switched the knobs for the closet and the bathroom. Wed ended up with a closet that locked from the inside and a bathroom door that stuck in the jam.

I tried the knob and made sure. It was locked.

Things were simple. I stopped going to school. When I needed food, I took money out of their sock drawers and bought it from the Fred Meyer at the end of the street. I did whatever I wanted. People sometimes called, and even stopped by. I got used to ignoring knocks on the front door. No one I couldnt handle until Bill Lewis.

Mr. Lewis was a drunk, but a likeable one. He owned the only bowling alley in town and used his position, such as it was, to get familiar with practically every man in town. People felt bad for him or genuinely liked him, so they gave him things. In this way he got money, cars, a house, even the bowling alley was given to him by the previous owner. Practically everything.

Apparently Dad had agreed to sell him a car; the VW Rabbit that Ol Pop had promised to give me when I was old enough.

I watched Bill Lewis roll away in *my* car, and straight into the lake.

A few minutes earlier, Id told him I was meeting friends there, and asked for a ride. Dad wasnt home to sign the papers, but he could have the car after that. We got to the top of the hill overlooking the boat ramp and I hit him in the head with a hammer. I got out, reached in and released the brake, and he rolled on in.

Shouldnt have been driving drunk anyway.

The neighbor, Mrs. Grayson came over to ask about the grass being overgrown. She died in her sleep that night and then I buried her in the yard. The cops were right. Bits of her showed up everywhere, but the lawn was tall enough to hide it.

I did eventually mow the yard, but after hitting bone after bone, scattered around, I realized that I couldnt be sure.

To *make* sure, the seven members of the Kersey family took a family vacation which was cut short when they pulled out on a particularly dangerous blind corner of the highway just outside of town. I hid in the woods and watched them burn.

The following day, I went to the Fred Meyer with the Kerseys money. Just like always. Just Tuesday. 

Just like normal, except that right in the middle of the frozen food aisle is Bill.

Bill Fucking Lewis, forehead caved in, dripping lake water and brains all over the floor while hes trying to decide between a Hungry Man and a Stouffers. I wiped my eyes. *Must be seeing things.* He was still there.

He went with the Hungry Man, put it in his cart with a swollen paler-than-pale hand. He pushed the cart toward me, shuffling along. With dead eyes, he saw me and waved slightly. No big deal. Just shopping. Just Tuesday.

I shut my eyes and wished him away. I fought to exist in a world where Bill stayed dead.

He patted my shoulder with enough force to almost knock me off balance. He gurgled something. Mouth working like a dying fish, ruined lungs just sloshing water in his throat, dead, blank eyes inquiring whether Dad was going to show up to bowl with them this weekend.

I ran, then.

Through the parking lot, past a family of seven who loaded groceries into their RV. Charred, skeletal children hung and played on the plastic kids shopping cart.

Almost home, Mrs. Grayson waved and watered her lawn from her front porch.

Inside the house. Home. Safe.

There was a knock on the door, but not the one Im used to hearing. The *closet* door.

I heard noises. Shuffling, scrambling around in the dark. Hushed voices.

The door wasnt locked. Someone unlocked it from the inside.

The bodies sat facing each other. The floor of the closet was covered with shreds of plastic sheeting. They turned and smiled at me.

Shut the door, buddy. 




 Definitely nuked. I've heard rumors that he's doing alright, just not redditing anymore. Miss the little bugger. 




 This is the scenario I'm terrified of whenever I can't remember someone's name.

 Everyone knows AL is an amazing writer, but this one of his is especially poignant. About as good as a short story can get. 




 Congrats! 




 That was... Exactly the same as my message. Aw.

She did offer to create some cover art for me. I can't stand that site though, and shan't be using it again. 




 I love Peggy.

Parks and Recreation actually had several characters that I couldn't stand, done in a good way because it gave something for the likeable characters to stand out against.

I'll just throw in for discussion how writing and film/TV seem to differ. When you show it on screen, it seems like fewer people in the audience take it as "the director thinks this way." There's been a lot more discussion of actors just playing a part.  But when someone, especially someone less well known, writes a character like that, it seems to be taken seriously more often.

I don't think morality factors in. People rooted for Walter White, and raged against Skyler. You can be right and still come across as an asshole, it's all in the presentation.

People really hate Peggy? 









 Yes I think it's smaller. It's bigger than 100 like I said, though. At a given time there are 500-1000 people on the sub. Most of those aren't logged in, and therefore can't vote. Some of those are browsing their front page, click to a single story, then click out (probably a lot, I think), given the difference that being in the top three spots make for vote frequency compared to 4-10.

The ones you're left with, the ones who are there, reading nosleep stories... There are probably low hundreds.

Disclaimer: making wild generalizations based on old data with no formal training. 




 You can't forget the importance of other social media these days, too. Some people friend on reddit if they like your stuff, but a lot more writers post their stuff to blogs, Facebook, tumble, twitter... I don't know because I don't do it, but you get the idea.

You mentioned 50, but a writer with a thousand followers/friends/tweeteaters gets views. And *quickly*, which against the colossal noise of newnosleep is the make-or-breaker.

It didn't used to be like that. Almost no one did that a year ago. I remember because it popped up in the OOC whether it was even allowed. The first time I saw that, I down voted all their stories (they wee posting every day) to offset the "unfair advantage."

So now look at the writers for Spire in the Woods and Penpal. They pretty much came out of nowhere, but their stories are fucking amazing. They didn't come in with followers, but they're still competing for the half hour a day that a redditor is willing to read nosleep stories.

So, no. I don't think that they'd have a chance today because they wouldn't get to the front page, which, if you can't do, only exposes your writing to the hundred or so dedicated nosleepers who go to /r/nosleep and not the millions of subscribers who only see nosleep on their front page.

 Dead, what do you think about violence in writing? 









 I've got a few minutes of pedaling left, let me tell you about what I've built here.

The pedals turn the crank, which I've extended and added a small sprocket to. That sprocket is connected by a chain which goes to a large sprocket. That's connected to a drum which winds a cable carrying a large amount of weight.

On the bottom of the weight is a blade. When the cable is wrapped around a sufficient portion of the drum, a button will be depressed, allowing the drum to turn freely, dropping the weight.

The blade, traveling approximately 60 feet vertically and so weighted, will shear me right in two. My two halves will then fight each other to the death.

If neither side survives the split (as is, unfortunately moat probable), then my last moment will be spent lamenting why I built a contraption that required so much exercise to operate.

Wish me luck! And may the best side win.

 Summarize a movie in three frames (or more.. or less.. three is really just a guideline). There are plenty of examples at /r/3FrameMovies if you want to work from a reference. If you want to try this theme on hard mode, try to convey the plot of the movie (as though you were explaining it to a friend who had not yet seen it) without using words. Think about which moments in the movie represent pivotal plot points.

 There are two steps to any murder -- three if you're being technical.

First, there's the planning and preparation. If you're the murderer, this is your meat and potatoes. *This* is where you earn your money. Everything that goes into you not getting caught goes into this first step. If it was a chess game (and don't think that it isn't), this would be your opening, middle and end game. 

Technically, the act of the kill is the following step. In the bigger picture, it's insignificant, though. A blip. A moment in time at which a threshold is passed. Everything else, the real work, should already be accomplished. This is just the cherry on top of it all. And anyone who's ever eaten a sundae knows that it's not the cherry that you remember. The cherry doesn't matter at all. It just has to be there, plopped on top of so many other carefully laid layers. It's really only the movies and books that make it seem important. They make it seem like something magnificent, they glorify it. They'd better, it's what the audience has come to expect.

Which leads us to part three: the detection. You've played your chess game and now the detectives get their chance to play theirs. I often picture it like a dam. If the dam holds against the probing pressures of the water behind it, then the murder goes unsolved. The important things for the detective are to find the weak points and to have possession of the proper tools required to apply leverage to them. You couldn't use a common screwdriver on a hex head bolt just as you can't crack a murder case without witnesses, evidence or confessions.

The beauty of these rules is that they're all very flexible. Even breakable. A murder may not have any preparation at all, a simple act of passion which ends a life. This may make it easier for the detective, and often does, but *not necessarily*. Remember, the planning and preparation aren't for the murder, but in order to prevent discovery, and so even after the murder is committed, it's still possible to cover up what's happened. Yet other murders are never attempted to be discovered. Either because of exact planning or because of a profound insignificance of the kill itself.

But perhaps the most interesting type of murder is the one in which no one's died at all -- not yet. The plans have been laid, weapons manufactured and at a moment's notice they're ready to be deployed. The "investigation" such as there would be one, is already agreed upon. Damage assessed, fines and treaties settled on. The only thing missing is the order to fire ze missiles. 




 "I'll take it off your hands," the devil said.

A feeling, a conscience, a soul.

"But how will I love?" I asked him then.

"You won't," he softly spoke. 

"But nor will you hate. You'll feel nothing, just wait, I can make you a god among men. 

"Think of the pain you'll get to miss. The heartbreaks, the failures, the shit, isn't this what you wanted anyway?"

"Where do I sign?" I asked him then, mind wondering of life without pain.

I hope to god I don't end up in Hell, because I signed with the devil's name.

 In the desert of Arizona, a flea named Harry hatched from its egg. This fella was born with the thirst, and not just like the other bloodsuckers in his clutch of eggs. He had a thirst for human blood.

The rest of Harry's family stayed in the dog kennel they were born in, but the determined little flea made a break for the house. Once outside he saw that the house was on the other side of a dusty hot yard and a pile of junk cars.

His first hop took him to the sand. Grains half the size of Harry dislodged and rolled around him. Dust cloyed his tracheae. In an instant his internal temperature nearly reached the boiling point.

It took a few moments to free himself from the rubble. Once he'd dug himself free and found a suitable launch point on top of a piece of gravel, he lashed out with his strong back legs.

He landed in the mercifully cool shade of a black Buick. Another quick hop took him to the top of the tire. The warm rubber was laced with pits and imperfections that were easy to sink his claws into. Compared to the sun and the sand, this was a paradise. He considered just staying there until he died in a few short days.

But the hunger called.

He soared through the air and onto a welcome mat beneath the front door. Fibers stuck out in every direction. This was it. One more hop and he would be inside the house.

The mat shifted beneath him. Harry couldn't breathe. Just before his vision faded to black, he saw that the cat he'd landed on was wearing a flea collar. 







































 Mom found my sketchbook again today.

When Dad finds it, he just hits me and yells. I almost prefer it; at least its over quickly. Its Moms method to sit me down and explain why what Im doing is wrong. I dont agree, and she wont change my mind, it just feels like it takes forever. Everyone has heard the story a million times since they were children. I dont know what she expects to happen.

The story goes like this: 

The creators redesigned the world with two cities. Two being the perfect number of cities to have on a planet like ours. This one, the one we live in now, is named Alpha. The other, Gamma.

The city of Alpha was made perfect in every way; Utopia. The creators designed it specially for their favored creations -- us -- to inhabit. Before the creators wiped the world clean and started anew, there was war, disease, suffering, *imperfection*. Not anymore.

Little is known about Gamma, other than its location. The twin city is located exactly 180 degrees around the planet from Alpha; 7,547 miles in any direction. Still more evidence of the creators perfect design. Who would we wage war against? Where would a sickness evolve? How would it travel? The two cities are perfectly separated.

But that was in the beginning; ancient history. Over time, the creators city faded and wore down. We were shown how to use it, not to fix or build it. The creators left us alone too soon. 

My grandparents grew up in this same house that my parents and I are living in now, but had lived their whole lives never having used electricity. The electronic panels on the walls, now an indispensable wealth of information and communication, had sat dark and dormant their whole lives. For decades, the waste system lay in disrepair. Human waste -- shit, piss, even our dead -- was dumped over the wall and, with great effort (due to the smell), ignored. 

I said before that the two cities were perfectly separated. They were, that is, until Alvis Frost was born. 

A genius inventor, even as a child, it was rumored that the boy was half creator himself. At 13, he re-designed the waste incinerator so that the ashes could be packed into the beautiful clear bricks used to repair the buildings in Alpha. A year later, he re-engineered the water purifier to run self-sufficiently on solar power. Pumps at the purifier pushed it through the dormant system of pipes and into every home in the city. At sixteen, hed constructed a generator that harnessed the heat emanating from the planets core. When power was supplied to the main hub, the city came alive again.

During that  that the generator was being built, Alvis constructed a flying machine. It would be his last invention. 

A commission led by the mayor himself attempted to block his departure. Alvis was nearly arrested, even threatened to be killed, but in the end he struck a deal. He would return within one year, whether he found Gamma or not, and only after he had ensured that the citizens of Alpha would be able to maintain the technology that he had resurrected. Frost waited patiently. Slowly, the people caught on. In a few years time, Alpha was nearly restored to its former self.

Finally, the day came for him to leave, and so he did, shrinking into the West, until he was nothing more than a black dot, too small to be seen.

Nine days later, another dot appeared in the Eastern sky. He had returned. The citizens of Alpha welcomed him with open arms. My mother was there. She said that she thought that it was odd that he never smiled, even when everyone was so happy to have him back. She feared that Gamma was gone. Alvis retreated into his home, saying only that he needed to prepare, and no one saw him again for several weeks. 

Then out of the blue, he called a meeting of all the citizens of Alpha. Assembled there together, he put up a picture on the screen. It was the generator that hed designed. He explained how it operated, and what it was meant to do. Next, he showed them the water purifier, and how to use the brick byproducts to repair the structures of the city. He showed them the computer panels, how they lit up when electricity was connected to them, and they could be used to access a wealth of information.

The people of the city were confused -- why was he telling them what they already knew? Hed made sure to teach them these things before hed left. Had he forgotten? Did he not realize that hed come back to Alpha?

Then the truth came out. My name is not Alvis Frost. This city is not Alpha. My name is Hudson Link, and Ive just come from the real Alpha, the one Ive shown you in these pictures.

Ive come to the conclusion that chance alone could not account for the similarities between the cities. It cant explain the way that I look identical to someone born and raised here. It cant explain the... *bond* that exists between us.

Ive been through Alvis Frosts records. It took some time to be sure, but I can now say with confidence that they are precisely identical. Events in this city coincide with those in Gamma down to the day, down to the minute, in fact, to the very second. As I raise my hand on this side of the planet, Alvis Frost raises his in Alpha. As youve gathered here, your twins, differing only by name, have gathered around Mr. Frost. When I set out West on my journey here to Gamma... Alvis too struck out to the West. *Everything* is synchronized. *Everyone* is connected in this way.

They thought that Alvis was crazy. That his nine day journey had caused him to snap, losing track of where he was and even his own name. Of course, never having left the walls of Alpha, no one had seen anything like it.

They had him committed. It was for his own good, they said. Locked in the room of the tower for observation, he fell violently ill. They further separated him from having contact with anyone else. The mayor made it exceedingly clear that no one was to go near him. A disease had been contracted outside the wall; it wasnt safe.

That winter, as the first dusting of snow fell, Hudson Link succumbed to his sickness and died. They say that they found his body leaned against the Western wall of his cell.

The snow in Alphas streets rose and fell as winter came and went. People thought that that was the end.

... Until a speck appeared on the Eastern horizon. It grew as it crawled closer. Eventually they saw that it was a man.

Alvis Frost had returned. Sun-burnt, frost-bitten, starved and nearly a year older, but alive. Once Alvis -- the *real* Alvis -- had fallen ill, the mayor of Gamma (who indeed called themselves Alpha), had sent him back out of the city in order to keep the illness from spreading to anyone else. His flying machine had crashed over a range of mountains, forcing him to go the rest of the way on foot.

Its strange for me to think that as I pull this pen across the paper, somewhere else, someone who looks and thinks like me is writing the same words somewhere else. That everyone I know in Alpha is all that there is in the world, because their twins are just copies of them.

My mom tells me that because of this, its wrong to draw faces in my sketchbook. I dont understand it. Its like she thinks that by drawing them, Im creating them; causing new people to pop into existence.

And this cant be true, because I am not a creator. There *are* no more creators.

Are there?

If so, I think that it might come across as insensitive if not done with great care. I get that it's fiction and that it's an alternate reality, but people do actually suffer from those things.

The superpowers themselves sound cool, though. 




 That actually seems to fit better, though it's not what I was trying to write about. Happy coincidence.

Edit: The long way of saying my boss is fucking me and locking me away in his sex dungeon. 




 The living. The living care if you do that shit to dead bodies. 




 I like reddit links because they're easy. I'll admit that I am not super familiar with other sites, but you could risk getting into people looking to generate ad revenue. On /r/keepwriting we see this all the time. For someone who's posting their blog everywhere, it's not much of a stretch for them to make an alt.

Maybe something like link posts to reddit and in self posts, you could include blogs and other sites. 




 Everything's been done. It's a matter of how it's done that's important. In this case, I think, pretty well. 




 You're crazy! A psychopath!

Family get-togethers must have been fun. 




 Whoah! Fuck yeah. Someone probably flushed it as a baby. 




 Thanks. Definitely should spend more time in #WritingPrompts. 




 Thanks. You've definitely got a participator here. As soon as I saw it I thought of /r/nosleepreruns, which had the same kind of idea. 




 Oh what is this?

This is just... you're too much.

So my last two stories for nosleep bombed. I've been crabby about it, since writing isn't really the easiest thing for me. It takes a lot of focus and I write *slowly*. 

So when Sleep (Off) and A Gift didn't do well, I just thought that no one read them. Worse than that though, maybe I was losing touch with the audience. I was discouraged.

It means a lot that I come here (just randomly, too) and there's my name like people really read my writing that I work so hard on. Enjoyed it, even.

So anyway. Thanks. Perfect timing. And thanks again. 









 I can't have children. My husband and I have just come to accept that. We didn't have money for a surrogate or an adoption, and by the time we'll crawl out from under our loads of debt we'll be too old. It would be irresponsible to try.

Last year on December 15, I got a letter in the mail. I almost threw it away along with the rest of the junk, but something about it... I think it might have actually been the paper. I'm no Patrick Bateman, but the creamy smoothness of the envelope was somehow just *right* in my hand the way that I'd never considered before. It was pleasing. The triple-folded sheet inside was the same way. I laid it out on the counter, smoothing it out by running my hand over its intoxicating surface and studied the words, the stork logo and even the signature on the bottom.

*"A gift,"* I read. "The gift of creating a new life," which they would deliver for thousands who once thought that conception was impossible.

I did the worst thing I could have done when confronted with that kind of gorgeous promise. I accepted. I called and set an appointment to be seen the next day, then I tucked the letter back into its envelope and stuffed it into the drawer next to our checkbook.

The next morning, my husband left for work and I thought about telling him as I kissed him goodbye. I didn't, though. Some part  of me -- the rational part  -- was sure that it was too good to be true. Just another ad for just-another clinic that wouldn't accept our just-another-insurance-plan. But the other part drew me on with reckless hope and curiosity. 

As I got dressed I thought about medical advancements I'd seen in the news that might make this possible. While eating breakfast I wondered what being pregnant would feel like. As I backed out the driveway I wondered what I was going to name her.

By the time I reached the building, my heart was racing with excitement. I hadn't let myself actually feel anything about children since we found out that I couldn't have them. Maybe I really hadn't realized how much I felt that I needed to become a mother. All of that was bubbling to the surface as I pulled into the parking lot.

The building was beautiful, if out of place. It certainly didn't fit the image that I'd made in my mind. The large clinic crouched near the top of the hill and looked out over the ocean. Natural light streamed in through dozens of bay windows that faced the water. The sheer white walls seemed to glow from within.

The receptionist welcomed me and as she was checking me in, having me sign papers and fill out forms. I remarked on how beautiful the place was. It struck me that their usual customers must be paying fortunes to come here. She smiled and said that they're told that all the time, but that it was really more than just a doctor's office. The center focused on the "big picture" for both the mother and the child, and that fertilization was only the beginning. Most of the rooms, she said, were for recovery and bonding after the children were delivered.

"It's important to Dr. Bristol that the women we serve have a calming place during the transition of new life."

A nurse in white scrubs like I imagine Dolce and Gabbana might have made came and led me into the back rooms. She took my vitals in one of the rooms. The natural light and warm feeling of the sun continued even deeper inside the building, away from the windows.

"I'll let the doctor know you're ready," she said, her soft, warm hand resting on the door knob. "... And congratulations. This is such a great opportunity for you." She smiled and left.

I wasn't waiting for long before the doctor politely knocked and peeked in through the door. Once again, I was surprised, but this time I was underwhelmed. The doctor was short and frumpily dressed. Here was the I'm-in-a-hospital feeling that had been missing since I'd walked in.

He didn't say hello or even look at me until he'd thoroughly studied my file in the computer through coke bottle glasses. His red, glistening face glowed against the backdrop of the white room.

"Ah," he said finally. "This is fantastic. I have just fantastic news for you. You're going to be able to have children. As a matter of fact, you're just perfect. Just fantastic." He smiled and rubbed his hands. "So, a boy or a girl?"

"Well, I... My husband and I haven't really talked about this, but I'd like a girl, I think."

"Perfect, though we could do a boy too, if you'd prefer that."

"Prefer it? You get to choose?"

"Well, *I* don't, but we allow all our new mothers to choose. It's our whole philosophy here."

The nurse in white knocked and re-entered the room, carrying a tray which she set on the table.

"What is?"

"To eliminate stress from the whole process. Some women we serve have a great deal of stress over those things. Many can't decide, so we end up delivering them twins. So many twins, actually, it's quite fantastic.

"So. Are we ready?"

"Ready?"

"Oh yes, we need to act fast if we're going to be able to get you in."

"I'm sorry, I was under the impression that this was just a screening. The letter said..."

"No no no! Don't stress. This isn't going to cost anything, and the decision is not permanent. If you change your mind at any time, you're more than welcome to come back and we'll help you through it. Does that help? I had hoped that we would be able to serve you today. A girl, you said."

"So, what, it's just a... some kind of treatment that will make me fertile again?"

"Yes, exactly."

"And... it's not going to cost anything?"

"It's my own very personal interest. Each year during the holidays I offer my service free of charge. A gift."

"And say, tomorrow I talk to my husband and we decide again that we shouldn't have kids... I can just come back?"

"We'll take care of you. Whatever you need."

The whole thing was crazy, but what was there to lose? To gain?

"My husband, though, I mean, what do I say?"

"Say whatever you like... Or say nothing at all. This is your process, it works however you want it to. Exactly the way you want it."

"Sorry, I just... I'm surprised, that's all."

The nurse was offering me a tissue. Tears were streaming down my face, but I couldn't process what they meant. It was all overwhelming at that moment.

"Shall we, then?"

I nodded. The nurse prepared the needle, and Dr. Bristol swabbed the area on my behind with disinfectant. A pinch was all that I felt. I tried not to shake as I held in my sobs of joy.

"All done."

That night I made love to my husband like I hadn't since we were younyoung lovers. 

I didn't say a word to him about the clinic or the doctor or the treatment. The right moment never came. The last time we'd even talked about children was years ago; did I really even know how he felt about it anymore? Then after the deed, I felt as if I'd lied to him, ambushed him. 

It would be a surprise, but an innocent one, at least as far as he knew.

The next morning I was sore. My legs were wobbly and my stomach was churning and bloated. From the lack of sleep, my head was foggy. On my way to the shower, I threw up. I felt drunk. Feverish.

The day after, I felt even worse, and I was hungry *all. the. time.*

The third day is when I noticed that my stomach was sticking out, even more than it had on Thanksgiving. It wasn't just food, but wasn't it early to be getting a bump?

On the fourth day, I called the clinic again. I made it clear that I had to be seen immediately. Something was wrong.

"Don't stress," the receptionist told me. "Just stay calm and come out whenever you can."

---

"It's too late," the doctor told me. "Up to the third day, it's possible to remove the fetuses, but at four, it's hardly doable."

"Fetuses? What are you talking about? They're... they're nothing! I *just* had sex. It isn't enough time to..."

"This is fantastic, really. You're going to make them all so happy."

"Them, who?"

"The new mothers, of course."

"What?"

"Well, they're all waiting."

"What are you talking about? They're *waiting?* Waiting for what?"

"For their children, of course. Your children."

"What? I didn't agree to this."

"On the contrary. I'm quite sure that you signed the release."

"But I -- You said that I could change my mind. I want to change my mind, I'm changing it! This isn't what I thought!"

"I'm sorry. It is too late. You should just be happy! Hundreds of women are going to get to know the joys of motherhood because of you."

*"Hundreds?"*

"Oh yes. You see, our method is to fertilize *all* of the eggs at once. One shot. Of course, there are *thousands* of those. After fertilization, we harvest the most desirable according to the wishes of the mother. Through a simple surgery, then, we transplant them from your uterus into the new mother's. You're a hero, really, you've given them a fantastic gift."

"I don't want to. I just... I can't have children. I can't."

"You can't?"

"I'm infertile. That's what they said -- infertile!"

"Hm, well if that's your choice."

"So you'll... stop this. This... *thing* inside?"

"It's too late, miss. I'm sorry. Those other mothers... promises have been made to them. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be ethical. We need to see you in two days. Please make sure to schedule an appointment on your way out."

In the following weeks, I grew. I stopped leaving the house. My husband wasn't allowed into the bedroom anymore, he asked too many questions.

Oh yes, a few times I expected to wake up from a strange dream... A nightmare. I woke up every day, however, to find that nothing had changed.

I never went back to the clinic. I guess I was trying to... I don't know. Wait it out, maybe.

Then the sheets were soaked with blood. Pain rocketed all over my torso. Waves of it, and pressure.

My screams drew my husband, who kicked in the door. They were already coming out. Little sacs with placental tails. I don't know how he held it together.

He wouldn't let me die. And he kept my secret the whole time that I recovered on a half-awake request of mine.

What would I do without him?

Perhaps... Yes, I should give him a gift. He'd love that.

I'm sure I'll do it right this time. 




 Can't believe I read that whole thing. Barf. Ugh. 




 /r/darktales. High quality, low number of subscribers.

/r/shortscarystories is great too. 




 Absolutely love this story. 




 Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzafRKjSpR4). 




 Your post reads backward and forward. Sort of. 




 /r/narratemystory 









 For shits and giggles, I tried finding the place on Google Maps. Looks like it's closed down. Is it ironic that they renamed the place, "the Red Roof Inn?" 




 Yep. Guilty as a pregnant nun. 




 Don't see what you're talking about. 




 What are you saying about me? 




 No, don't. Come back. Stop.

...Welp. 




 Please make /r/DarkTales happen. 




 [Obligatory!](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5t_tgiWatvs) 




 Nah. It's hard.
