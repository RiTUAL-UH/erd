 When will these be available as would prefer a straight clean install on multiple machines instead of upgrading ??? 




 Are these things made in a studio or wind tunnel? 









 The Freak's days are numbered, I'd love it if she was sent down for attempted murder, destination Wentworth and let the sparks fly 




 Bee as The Freak, mind blown 




 Which direction will the new episodes take then, will they go straight paranormal as that always worked, will it all be aliens, how about some spooky episodes with horror thrown in, will it be from canon or will it be new ideas, there has to be some bridging from the last films / series but instead of getting bogged down I think it's best to kind of forget some past events and tell new stories, that way it's not getting drawn back too much and will let the new stories shine 




 Describe the characters in one word only...

Bruce = brooding / Gordon = liability / Bullock = grouchy / Alfred = fastidious / Nygma = riddles / Penguin = waddles / Ivy Pepper = prunes / Selena Kyle = climbs / Harvey Dent = flips / Fish Mooney = swims 




 It means fucked, screwed, done over 




 Nygma riddles, Penguin waddles, Bullock curses, Jim chases, Barbara exhales, Leslie dissects, Ivy prunes, Cat climbs, Alfred tuts, Bruce broods 




 And not forgetting throwing pencils at ceilings 




 Gillian loves knobs 




 It seems he has a murky past, a dead end job, no missus and now Gordan taking the limelight

I wonder where Bullock is going, will he stay canon or will they throw in a newbie to complete him

Gordon has all the luck, drive and women just falling at his feet, Bullock is most definitely bollocksed
