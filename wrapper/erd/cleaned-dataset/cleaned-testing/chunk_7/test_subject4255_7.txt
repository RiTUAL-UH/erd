 Showing great appreciation for someone working to save your companions!? WHAT AN ASS! 

/s 




 And it's fucking expensive too! I have a friend that has the 6mb/s and he pays like $30 a month. 




 Can we get some sources? 




 Dank meme. 









 I love how it calls out other rappers for their 'bubblegum raps'. 




 This is an apology for the words he used. This is ***not*** an answer to my question.  




 There are subreddits where these people grab each other's knobs and tug like there's no tomorrow. Full of hate and racism. 




 Yeah yeah, red herring. Go back to your racist subreddit. 




 /u/KevinSorboHere is Kevin Sorbo's username.

 I appreciate your compliment!  




 I didn't mean his religious beliefs. To each their own. 

What I meant were his blanket statement beliefs like: all atheists are 'god-haters', or 'all black people that are struggling aren't trying hard enough', etc.  




 I mean, he did sign up for an 'Ask me anything." 




 Kevin, here is a comment you made about the Ferguson protestors (I'll hyperlink it so you can click it and be taken to the source):

[Ferguson riots have very little to do with the shooting of the young man. It is an excuse to be the losers these animals truly are. **It is a tipping point to frustration built up over years of not trying, but blaming everyone else, The Man, for their failures.** It's always someone else's fault when you give up. Hopefully this is a reminder to the African Americans \( I always thought we just Americans. Oh, well.\) that their President [they] voted in has only made things worse for them, not better.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/kevin-sorbo-ferguson-animals-losers_n_5697647.html)

My questions is as follows:  

In regards to the selection I have bolded: Do you really believe that African Americans are not at a disadvantage in our (American) society? Enslaved for hundreds of years, [falsely reported as inferior by pseudo-scientific studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#United_States:_slavery_justified), segregated after emancipation, subjected to [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_States) (especially in Ferguson, MO as cited by a [DOJ report](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)), constantly bashed by conservative media, etc. After all of the history and examples I have linked, do you still believe they are simply "not trying"?
 




 I feel bad if he receives downright hateful comments. Those are just confirming his biases on atheism. 

I do appreciate people questioning his beliefs, especially the ones he holds that are ignorant.   




 "I immediately regret this decision."

-Kevin 




 Thank you!!!! 




 I hope so! Two-word captchas are becoming scarce, unfortunately. :/

I made this one myself, just today! 




 Boo captions! 




 Thank you! I will download that mod!  









 [OH NO!](http://i.imgur.com/HNXYxRe.png) 




 This is what I come here for. A great quality gif with zero captions!  




 Sounds like a captcha. 




 I had to change it back to a plain white base because it looked terrible on my craft with the flag textures!  




 Yes!

What's the best way to upload them to share with you? 




 Yeah, I mistakenly thought the round cylindrical tank was fuel for my engines but I was too lazy to change it.  




 Well, my next mission will be rescuing these hunks. I ran out of gas.  




 no :/ 




 Recipe pls!!! 




 I don't think that's the reason.

The reason he was cool after OP causally explained the situation is because OP is full of shit and this story is made up. 




 OP is Vince Vaughn. 




 Sick fucking reference.  




 Thank you!!! 




 Thank you for this. I love this show. 




 Bringle Space Program. Lol  




 Shoutout to /u/jatwaa, he brought me out of my hiatus.  




  Drake isn't even in the same league as Cole and Kendrick.

-What I said 

 They have different musical purposes, you can't compare them.

What you reiterated.  









 Drake isn't even in the same league as Cole and Kendrick.

Drake makes bangers and gaga ballads (stuff women go crazy over)

Kendrick and Cole make songs about social issues. 




 Never mind, I found it:

 I can't seem to find an image/texture anywhere.  




 Idk, maybe his inspiration from the story came from the show? 




 But a rolodex is not for *your* contact info. It's for others' contact info. 




 But there is no posession!!!!! 




 Drunk assholes don't deliver. 




 I got a creepy-crawly machine for Christmas when I was young.

But I couldn't eat my creations. I wanted cupcakes because I loved food. 




 We're only hearing OP's side of the story.

Anyway, I must be lost because /r/pettyrevenge doesn't seem like the place to question the revenge that took place. It's more of a "yeah fuck that person" bandwagon.  




 I try to empathize with people. I wonder what made that lady close her store so early? Maybe a bad day?  




 The first panic attack I ever had was when I lit up my first joint. My heart started racing and I felt like I was losing control.   

I kept jumping up and down saying "you see, it's not a dream because you're not flying."

I continued to touch everything I could because I was convinced that I was dreaming. I went to bed that night and I wasn't the same for months. I was in constant dismay about reality. I would have panic attacks. 'Inception' struck a chord and I haven't watched the movie since.   

Then I was with a close friend and I started projecting my issues to him. He said: 

"You know, test_subject4255, even if we are living in a dream, isn't it the best dream ever?"

I haven't forgot that since. 

I was convinced that I just had a laced joint so I had to prove to myself that it was a fluke. I've smoked twice since (over a 6 year period) and I have had some good experiences. Things that really turned my mind around. I don't plan on using it again because it's really not my taste but I'm glad I got over my fear. I haven't had a panic attack since.  

Anyway, I know that you're probably trying to find a connection between your current state and my story and I just wanted to let you know that it is MORE THAN OKAY to reach out to supportive loved ones/friends about your issues. Who knows? One of them might make you feel a ton better.   

Edit: I am not condoning the usage of marijuana. This is just simply my story about a bout of depression I experienced. If you are medically depressed, I am also not condoning skipping of meds/holistic cures/not getting treated. Some people are born with chemical imbalances that medication can help with.

 It was something about his movements. They either didn't seem organic or were too fluid and slow.

If it wasn't for my SO being such a fan of the film, I would've left and got my money back.


Not to mention I had to watch it in 3D with that shitty frame rate that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera.  




 Texas lost an idiot and gained a manipulative man. 




 Not a problem! 




 Haha! I appreciate it! 




 **Meatballs**  

* 1 roll spicy country pork sausage   
* 1 roll spicy Italian sausage   
* Handful of chopped arugula   
* Large handful of cubed or shredded mozzarella   
* Sea salt to taste (I used smoked salt) 

Form meatballs and place in a hot skillet. Cook until halfway done  

**Broth**   

* 1 medium carrot 
* 4ish green onions   
* 1 stick of celery   
* 1/2 stick of butter   
* Bullion or broth of your choice  
* 1 Chayote squash  
* 1 chicken thigh, chopped ham, or bacon   
* 1 jalapeno   
* 1 gallon of water   
* Sea salt to taste

Get pot hot and toss in butter, chopped carrot, jalapeno, green onion, and celery. Mix occasionally and let it come together, about five minutes Chop chicken and add it, cook halfway and add the water. Add bullion to taste.

Toss in chopped squash and bring water to a good simmer. Let simmer until flavors come together. Add meatballs and grease from pan.   

Cook until meatballs are done.  

Dish, top with parmesan cheese and cilantro (or arugula if you don't like cilantro)  
**Enjoy!**  

The squash is about 4.5-5 net carbs   
Arugula is 2 carbs per cup  
Carrot about 3 carbs   
Celery is about 2 carbs   
Green onions are 2 per onion  

One pot of soup (21 - 24 carbs) made at least six bowls for me, so the carbs are spaced out pretty well (3.5-4 carbs per serving). 




 I've been there, it's a great city! 




 Oh! I'm so sorry!!

Millions of other youtubers are as well. I guarantee James is doing okay.

 I called my local PD and they don't explicitly have this policy but seem not to care if it's something you do.

What do I need to do in order to pass this sort of legislation? I'd hate to get shot by some cops while trading money for a bicycle.  




 Do it! You need to use Kosher Salt (bigger chunks of salt) though. No table-top stuff!

 Dude, thanks!  




 Wow, it looks almost like a colored pencil drawing. 




 You are taking an incident of Jeremey Clarkson punching someone in the face and comparing it to pedophilic actions.  




 It's called a red-herring. /u/Echelon64 is unable to come up with a counter argument that fits the topic at hand so he/she chose to change subject.

 I there with you. I've had HBP since I was 18. I'm 25 now. Stress was an important factor but my HBP didn't go down until I changed my diet. 

I'm not sure what will work for you but I started cutting carbs out and it made a huge difference. I know it sounds weird because fat (for a long time) has been thought to cause heart problems. I have (in my experience) found it to be the opposite. I'm on a high-fat low-carb diet and I've never felt better. Keep in mind, I count calories too. Too many and you'll gain more weight. 

Everytime I mention the following subreddit I get downvoted, but you should check out /r/keto. Now ketosis is used mainly by super overweight people as a weight loss program (they'll lose like 20lbs a month). I'm a 5'9" 180lb male and I just use it as a diet program. I eat red meat, chicken, vegetables, etc. I try to eat a lot of fiber and healthy fats. It's helped my blood pressure and heart rate immensely. With the diet you lose out on potassium and magnesium and you'll have to take supplements. You also need to drink a lot of water. 

Exercise is important also. I try to walk everywhere I go but I'm not super active (I really should be).  




 There needs to be a rule against fake shit.  




 That dude was so fucking awkward. 




 Probably because this post is tagged [Serious] and they were making jokes. 




 Wait, so alcohol kills stomach bacteria too?  




 Totally agree. I've appreciated every video I've seen on here. Random ideas for videos are original ideas. There's no need to hate these creators. Want better videos? Make your own or browse /r/videos. 




 I honestly believe that most of his supporters have no idea his name is "Rafael Edward Cruz". 




 You're acting like they're not going to get punished.  




 I doubt it. If the kid had a gun and was threatening the old man, that's what would be reported. Self defense. You're just hyperbolizing to fit your "gun-freedom" agenda.

 I cannot make this up:

https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/30081a/what_is_a_song_that_you_will_forever_associate/ 









 It's a damn fine guess.  




 I thought that might have been the case. Thanks for informing me! 




 I just wish they spent more of that money on infrastructure. Austin roads can't handle everyday traffic let alone the floods of people there for SXSW and ACL.  




 Thankfully, yes. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. I graduated, went to college, and now have a stable job and a semi-stable life. A ton better than what it used to be. 

Gosh, it doesn't feel that long ago. It's been more than six years. Woah. Time flies. 




 Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today. This happened 8 years ago. 

I grew up in the south Austin area and some new gang members from California had moved into the area. I wasn't involved in gang activity but I knew a lot of kids that were. 

One day I was walking home from a friends house and a truck pulls up to me with a couple of guys asking where my neighbor was. I told them I didn't know and they said that if I found out, let him know they're looking for him.

The next day in school I find out that they had a pistol on them and so I inform my neighbor's sister that they intend to kill her brother. I ask her to leave my name out of the mix when she confronts the principle about the problem but... she fails to do so.

A couple of days go by and I jump into bed and feel a cold piece of metal at my feet. I go to look at it and it's the head of a bullet. Then I start seeing holes in my walls. I lived in a trailer home (I had the middle most room, the trailer was facing the street [like this](http://i.imgur.com/d8zsEne.png)) and that bullet and two others had ripped through about 4 walls of my home. One hit a top bar of my bunk bed and fell into the bottom bunk. One ripped through the bathtub, my dresser drawer and landed in my box fan, and the other hit the bottom skirting of my house, landing underneath it. 

One bullet passed above me and my sister and the other below us. I never heard the shots (it must have been fired in the middle of the night a couple of nights before) and I never found out who did it. I called the cops, found the brass casings, but nothing ever came of it. We lived in the poor side of town so I didn't expect much. 

tl;dr: snitched and almost got stitched. 

Edit: Dangit! I meant to edit the title before I hit 'submit'. My neighbor ended up living. They backed off after his sister got the police and principle involved.  




 I hope it is and I hope it further tarnishes his name.

Or maybe I hope it doesn't and he gets chosen as their running man. He is sure to lose. 




 I think OP is just sick of the double-standards when it comes to the GOP. 




 That Obama was born on American soil and everyone had a bitch-fit about seeing his birth certificate. The double-standard that nobody is complaining when a white republican is technically 'less-American' 




 When I eat at McDonald's I'll usually get a couple of McDoubles. I ALWAYS ask for them to be in the same box but they rarely ever listen!!! I don't want to waste the paper but they'll individually box each one... 




 It's working now? Maybe region locked?

 FWIW I'm a socialist. :)

 Yes, when comments devolve to people spreading hate-speech, us moderators take action. I put a flair on the post to warn people.  




 I mean, that's how elections work?  

If you're talking about gerrymandering then I understand what you mean. Many districts don't really have a legit choice in who wins their representation because either side will always win.  




 I'd love to hear your side of the bill. I am completely against it.  




 We are about to have an [open-carry law](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/17/texas-senate-gun-open-carry/24892513/) on public college campuses too...  




 It's just the voters that elect them's fault. :( 




 I see GKMC as a biography of Kendrick's youth.  

I see TPAB as deep mental anguish that comes with being a popular black man in a white world. It's heavy on social commentary.

 How the fuck could I let myself get all worked up over eggs?  

My SO and I live together with a 3rd roommate. We'll call my SO "Lilly" and our roommate "Cindy".  

Lilly and I pretty much share almost nothing. When we shop together I buy stuff I need and she buys stuff she needs. Now with certain products, we'll rotate purchase. Eggs especially. I'll buy them one time and she'll get the next time, etc.  

Recently she's been shadowing a teacher that has about 80 chickens and she will give Lilly a dozen almost every week. So now we don't have to buy eggs because we're getting a steady supply of delicious farm-fresh eggs... until right now.  

Spring break was last week so we didn't get our weekly dozen. When I checked the carton yesterday we had 2 left, enough for a breakfast. So this evening I'm getting all excited because I figure I'll eat the two tomorrow morning and then when Lilly and I go to the store tomorrow evening, I'll buy a dozen. So as we're winding down in bed I ask Lilly "hey, will you make sure I get up at 7:30 tomorrow? I want to eat breakfast." Now mind you, I'm not a big breakfast guy. I'm trying to get in the habit of it because I'm always so unproductive in the mornings.   

Lilly says "Sure, but there's only one egg left and I'm taking it for lunch tomorrow."   


WHAT. "Lilly, why didn't you tell me we were down to our last egg?"  

"Well you never eat breakfast, megabenson." (Fair point)

"But but... Dammit! Now I have go to the store now and buy more!"   

So I get up, put my shit on, and head outside to my car. Except I'm blocked in by Cindy and my next door neighbors and Cindy is fast asleep.   

I get so damn mad! OVER SOMETHING SO SMALL.   

Mind you, I wasn't mad at my SO. I was mad because now I'm going to be hungry tomorrow morning and all I have are a few slices of ham and 0 eggs...   

Man fuck this. So fucking stupid.

 Sweet, I will attempt that this afternoon.  




 If I somehow found my product key, would it be as simple as transferring those files (via safe mode) to a usb, writing down the product key, and then fresh installing the OS on a new HDD? 




  magic jelly bean key finder

I might be able to run this program in safe-mode to find the key. 




 A friend of mine gave it to me. He installed it via flash drive on my tower (I don't have a cd drive). He copied the installation files onto another flash drive (so just in case something like this happened) and gave me them. 

The product key might be within the folder I placed those files into but that folder is on the broken HDD.

Edit: I'm not sure if it was a genuine copy or not. It didn't seem ripped because there were no special hoops he had to jump through. 

I think I might just have to buy another copy of it.  




 Yeah, the problem with that is I had a usb with those files on it. I moved them over to my system (I needed to use the usb to store a big project) and guess what? They are on the crashed drive. :/ 




 I don't understand why Windows 7 and 8.1 are the same price. The only thing I can think of is that they are trying their best to phase-out Windows 7. 

For how old Windows 7 is, I don't think $100 is a reasonable price so I'm looking to you all for help with this matter. Maybe you know of a not-so-common software shop that has copies or maybe you know about decent sales going on around the internet. 

Your help is greatly appreciated.
