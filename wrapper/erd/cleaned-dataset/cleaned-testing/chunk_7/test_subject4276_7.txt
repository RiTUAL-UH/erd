 Never saw that before, pretty damn funny

 No.  




 Negative  




 That's usually my philosophy. I don't bother with anything without an already listed price unless it's a necessity  




 Just found out they're around $1500.  




 Yeah, it looks to be mostly custom works so I'm sure pretty much everything is priced at "more than you can afford, pal" 

Then again they were at a trade show and to me it seems like most things at trade shows are either snake oil or highly overpriced  




 Probably the sharp ledges  




 It definitely depends on the state you're in 




 I actually like the controller but I don't use it on my PC, I was just charging it. Though I hope it's a bug that the xbmc team can fix 




 This is the future bro, 128 




 Prices are usually never listed at these shows for that reason 




 DC really is laying their TV show game on thick. No doubt to rake in what marvel hasn't already entirely consumed.

 I think the bigger issue with tinting is things like concealing weapons inside  




 Someone posted a link to a website that shows the inside. Look like Windows to me

 Yeah, that  




 OP from Watamote would be great  




 I wish the dishwasher I had was that clever. Whenever he'd bring our big whisks back he'd just yell "buttscratcher!!"  




 Thank God. It was a nightmare dealing with Google+ for pictures  




 Goddamn I know your feelings on the swaddle blanket. I hear that all the time, but nobody knows how hard it is for little Ricky Bobby to fall asleep. If he's swaddled he was constantly trying to get out of it, but when his arms are free they're up in his face rubbing his eyes and pulling the pacifier out of his mouth and in general raising a ruckus. Once you spend like an hour arm wrestling with him until he falls asleep he'll sleep through the night but if something wakes him up in the middle of the night good luck and be prepared to not get anymore sleep until tomorrow  




 Now if only you could have a live video feed of that sweet justice  




 Exactly what I'd expect you to post  




 That would be badass.  




 You'd be right.  




 No buttons being held down. It was just sitting right side up and plugged in. I unplugged it and turned the volume back up, and then plugged it back in and watched the volume go down again  




 I thought I was going crazy because when I turned XBMC on it was as if someone was constantly holding the volume down button with another keyboard. Turns out, a plugged in PS4 controller does exactly that 




 This post needs more cross section pictures because I can't believe half of those are cake without them 




 Back when my siblings and I were younglings it seemed like baby proofing the house was much simpler: gates for stairs, keeping doors closed/locked, putting covers on the electrical sockets. Most households still only had one TV, and maybe one game system. Phone Jacks were easily hidden behind furniture or were high up on a wall to begin with. And we didn't even get our first family computer until I was about 5.

Fast forward to today, my living room has a TV,  an AV receiver, a computer for the TV, a wireless router, a modem, speakers and a subwoofer, an external hard drive that needs to be plugged in, and four game consoles. It's all in one area and I need two power strips to handle it all. Then upstairs, I have a computer desk with open sides and back so all the cables are exposed.

Basically I really need some protips to baby proof all these wires and cables before little Ricky Bobby starts crawling and wants to play with the wires 




 I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say South Dakota doesn't get enough love. Here in Montana, we tell people to go there and North Dakota all the time

 All the reddit meet ups I've been to here were good. A bunch of us did trivia night at a bar once. It's hard to get a bunch of people together with vastly different lives though  




 Well it only happened to me when in hangouts so I figured it was a dumb feature  




 I used to work with a guy who got high before work. I preferred it when he was high. If he wasn't he was a cranky bastard that frequently lost his temper and would fuck shit up. When he was high he was in a good mood and worked efficiently with enthusiasm  




 I built my own steam box before steam view as a thing, except it runs Windows and has all my other media center stuff so basically it's just my movie /tv/gaming machine for the living room and not really a steambox but best of both worlds.

 I think it looks great. People are just mad that they didn't invent a screen that fits inside the phone but is actually bigger than the phone's footprint

 Yes, some brands may be more reliable than others, some may have a brighter screen, and some may have better remotes (for those of you not using a universal one). But it feels like most of what will make you happy with your purchase are things you can't filter or sort by on Amazon or Newegg. If it's a smart TV, what does the interface look like? Is it snappy and quick? Or is it sluggish and burdensome? How customizable are the TV settings? How well does the CEC (anynet+, bravia sync etc) perform? Is that reasonably customizable or does it operate by the laws of entropy? How does the screen look if you're in a bright room? Are reflections a problem? 

My point is, I'm looking for a TV and sure I can find all the "technical specs" but I can't find human interface or experience specifications which is making it extremely difficult to choose a TV I want

 No kidding, the only thing I have time for is taking care of my son, which takes away my money, eating, which keeps me out of shape, and my job, which takes away creativity. When I have any time to not do any of those I just want to take a rest 




 I'm not sure how I feel about this. I like K Rock despite the relatively small library of music they play, but I liked that there weren't any radio DJs to get in the way of the music.

 When did this start happening? How long ha r you had the phone?  




 I have this same problem with different headphone connectors. The audio cable I've had in my car for years works fine, a d the one in my work Truck works fine, but a new one I bought from monoprice for my truck won't make a solid connection at all. And I've had some headphones do the same.  




 Did Simmons talk about being into music at all in the QA? His role seems like it would be extremely difficult for someone without any sort of background in music performance. If he didn't have any experience with music that makes his acting performance so much better. Having done Orchestra and jazz myself had I never seen any of Simmons' previous roles, he would have had me convinced he was a director/musician first and actor second. His gestures, mannerisms, and movements were spot on perfect, including the throwing the chair bit. That seems to be a common trait for band directors.  




 Same here in band except my director actually did throw a chair at the drummers

 This comment thread is enlightening  




 And the FDA tried to put a stop to it, but backed off thanks to public comments


The revisions also address the issue of the use of spent grains, which are by-products of alcoholic beverage brewing and distilling that are commonly used as animal food. Concerns were raised that the proposed rules would require brewers and distillers to comply with the full human food and animal food rules if they made their wet spent grains available for animal feed. Theupdated proposed rule would clarify that human food processors that create by-products used as animal food and are already complying with FDA human food safety requirements  such as producers of wet spent grains  would not need to comply with the full animal food rule if they are already complying with the human-food rule.

 Even if you don't hit very hard it will make them stumble. Being hit in the nose in any form sucks 




 This was my dad's advice to me except to not be the first one to strike.  




 Yeah sorry for all the typos and general stream of consciousness. I typed that from my phone after driving for an hour and a half at 730 this morning  




 I always make this recommendation because when I moved into Bozeman for school, a couple places I applied at told me they already had hired people that were starting in a couple weeks when they got in from out of state. That upset me a bit because I was there and ready to work immediately. 

I've also put in applications to places and not get a response, even while trying to follow up on them and have them end up calling me over a month later for an interview. 

It's tough to say what would be the best course of action if they're telling you to apply when you're actually up here. Like what /u/Croup-vandemar said, maybe don't mention you haven't yet permanently moved, but I wonder if it's worth it to book a flight to make an interview when you're not guaranteed a job. I feel like some places may be open to a phone interview, but like before, you run the risk of them passing and telling you to try later 




 Yeah but the problem is that the population is growing faster than  the rate of housing being built. And as I said, housing is only half of the problem. The other part is the quantity of available jobs and whether they can or are willing to pay a living wage, or continue to rely on cheap college labor  




 The college is causing a depreciation of both jobs and housing. Every year, they let more freshman attend, even though they don't have the facilities to house them and for the first month they'll stuff 4 students into what are supposed to be common rooms for the dorms. Then the next year those freshman go out and try to get am apartment off campus, filling up all the available apartments. Sure, there's always something for rent, but competition is nuts. 

When my brother was moving up to Bozeman for school, my parents wanted to save some money by having him basically rent a room from my wife and I. I was for it because we would be able to rent a place with more space for less money, but we never found anything and he ended up going to the dorms. That brings me to my next point: you might have to be willing to rent sight unseen. We found something that would work great and was the right cost, so we set up the soonest available appointment to look at it. The place went on the market the very day we called. The first appointment to look at it was in a week. We show up to look at it and nobody is there. We wait about 10 minutes and nothing. We called the rental agency and they told us they ready found tenants for that property, without even notifying the people who scheduled appointments to look at it. 

Now for jobs, demand for jobs is very high, again because there are so many students. You might get lucky because some positions might open up with students leaving for the summer, but don't expect to get paid a whole lot. Many companies are taking advantage of the cheap unskilled college labor. Why pay someone more because they know what they're doing? We can hire this other guy, and train him for less money because he's willing to work for cheap because he needs rent/beer money. Unless you are a professional, it's a little difficult to make a decent living out here. 

Anyway, that's my ranting and raving about Bozeman. I love the place but I moved to Billings for work because I wasn't making any progress in paying off my student loans there 




 I don't think there are any gas pumps with tap and pay at the pump. You're safe if you pay inside with card anyway. 

That being said, nfc isn't all that secure.  




 I'm in the worst damn state. I never see anything at all for sale ever 




 500-750 is the range for studio to 2 bedroom apartments around here with varying degrees of amenities  




 Have a job lined up before you get here. It could end up being some time before you're able to find a place to live 




 Social justice warriors  




 Jesus I'm not even very old and these comments make me feel old because I understand nothing 









 The email I saw was an internal GM Petroleum email sent to all the conoco stations in the Billings area, so at least one of the stations was a conoco in Bozeman, and since the readers were installed on the inside of the machine it would have to be any station that isn't open 24/7

Which store isn't what is important though, this can happen to any store or ATM  




 That's only because they messed with the inside. If it's one of the ones that fit on the outside and isn't instantly recognizable, chances are your card will still work at the pump  




 Yep, paying inside from now on 




 Saw a forwarded email directed to a bunch of conoco gas stations warning that there were skimmers found on pumps in Bozeman. Be on the lookout when paying at the pump, these devices are getting better at being concealed 




 And I'm willing to bet the only way to make it illegal is to piggyback it onto another unrelated bill 




 They're just sleeping  




 I fucked that up didn't I? Goddamn it. I always have that inner voice when I type the name that I used the wrong one

 Hello there, fellow Montanan. Were you disappointed in the wreck like me?  




 I love these man, you instantly became my favorite YouTuber when I came across one of your kazoo'd videos. 

Do a slightly sped up version of the super Mario 3 theme! I think one of my favorite songs ever is a jazz rendition of it but a kazoo'd version would be amazing  




 He does lots of drunk videos and they look like a heck of a time 




 I love watching his vlogs but i can't stand his video game commentary anymore  




 And not only that, it spurred a fad where it seemed like every publisher started pushing games with proprietary controllers that would never be used again so they could cash in on selling meh games for $100+ like that Tony hawk game with the skateboard controller. People just got burned out about buying games you couldn't just use a regular controller with. 

Though now it seems they've moved onto things like Skylander where they can get kids to beg their parents to buy them these action figures that also double as characters in a game 




 If they really are working on a new rock band game, I really hope they're spending time on making the equipment look nice, works well, is sturdy, and can be collapsed into a smaller size. The guitars are fine but the drummers goddamn 




 I still love to have mine around. It's great for when you have company over and run out of things to do  




 Tell me about it. We got rid of our stuff years ago when we were living in a small place and didn't ha e room. Well now we have room and want to have it again and it's nearly impossible to find good equipment. Ended up spending a hundred bucks getting two guitars, and drums, all with the wireless receivers, and the guy also had DJ Hero with it. The guitars are in okay condition, but we can only use one because one of the wireless receivers is actually a rockband 2 receiver, and I don't even know about the drums yet because the usb connection to the circuit board on the receiver is shot so I have to replace that usb cable.  




 It's the same in that there's music you play in the game, but that's really about it 




 How would it affect people with THE CDL jobs?  




 You don't want currenc. It'd incredibly insecure and if there's ever a problem with getting hacked, you as a consumer have absolutely no protections because it's linked directly to your bank. Everything that credit card companies provide to you is lost if you use currenc

Edit
I'm sorry I just saw other people say the same thing as me already in a better way and I just added a shit post to it. 




 Have any tips for an aspiring DM? I'm just now getting into DD with a tiny (just 4 of us)  group of people. 3 of us have never done it before and our DM has never DMed before so I guess our sessions are really relaxed, and we're rotating DM responsibilities for each arc and I'd like to have a go at it

 My problem with all the cases that don't cover the IR blaster is that their solution is to just put a hole there. The power button isn't exactly a big button and having to press a button through a hole with my small hands would be miserable. The only case I've seen that did what I liked is the supcase one. It has a clear button over the IR blaster. Why is that so hard for everyone else to do?  




 Part of him that's supposed to help him walk that wasn't doing its job anymore is helping him walk now whether it likes it or not

 7th post down in a search for "hot dog recipes" I found the thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1e7zz1/i_need_a_new_simple_hotdog_recipe/

I was bored  




 There is no proper way to put it in there because it's not supposed to go there  




 This is my fear for buying myself a nice knife for home cooking. My wife beats the shit out of the bad knives we do have and she'll get butthurt if I tell her she can't use my knife lol 




 Jus  the tip 




 We're your /u/cool_hand_luke senses tingling?  




 I feel ya there. The last restaurant I worked at I did a year and 3 months there. If you worked an average of 30+ hours per week between open enrollment periods you'd qualify for health benefits. Well I did get 30+ hours per week but the restaurant opened in January, and open enrollment ended mid December. Basically, no matter how many hours you worked, every person who got hired for opening the restaurant got screwed out of health benefits for another year. I had already been looking for a better paying job when I found that out but that only intensified my search. 

Now instead of barely scraping by each month paying only the minimal amount on my semi-crippling debt of $18,000 thanks to school, I've paid off $7,000 since April  




 For a second I was wondering why cool hand like double posted but you got me damn you  




 The funny part is that this rule was added BECAUSE someone made a call-out thread for /u/cool_hand_luke. It's just too perfect  




 God damnit I want to read that but I'll be fucked before I go look through someone's comment history  




 I like his sub, just not that bullshit like this gets upvoted 




 What did you do this time?  




 He's actually super crazy but acts normal when he needs to which is why he's a great actor 




 It really is amazing how the human mind can adapt. I would have thought a viking would be too busy smashing the computer with his war axe than learning to type  




 See, I guess I've always experienced TV because aside from optimum adding HD channels and charter adding more HD channels, I've had the same TV experience for the last 15 years. Nothing has changed there for me except that I only use TV at my parents place when we visit. I just get Internet  




 Yeah, optimum was providing 16/2 and when charter took over they upped it to 30/2 and not even 2 year later doubled it again. I didn't have any complaints with optimum but I'm really happy with Charter right now. MSU has shitty Internet.  




 Our area isn't part of the swap. The original company here sold to Cablevision and then Cablevision sold it to charter and I have a feeling it was because they weren't happy with how things are going.  




 This may be a new contender for best time OP delivered ever 




 Hopefully the only reason you're getting downvotes is because the game isn't available anymore because it actually was a pretty solid game back when I had my droid x2 




 Charter definitely seems to be the least shitty of the major ones. Though they keep petitioning Montanan government to waive some certain taxes that are levied here claiming they are a burden and Montana keeps rejecting it. I have a bad feeling that if they don't get their way they will sell the market to comcast. I haven't had any complaints with them so far since they took over from optimum/Cablevision. They recently doubled everyone in the cities from 30/2 to 60/4. It's by no means Google fiber but hey, it's Montana, at least I'm not mailing my reddit comments via pony express.  




 Sheesh. Yeah if I had four months I wouldn't be as upset  




 What in the fucking fuck am I looking at? Jesus if I got a part in a band or Orchestra and they handed something that looked like that to me I'd walk out.  




 God damnit I love this subreddit  




 Try that but with every single ship and you have tumblr.com 




 Same thing happened to us and we gave up on it around the same time. Sometimes it just doesn't work. I think part of the problem with us is that short tongues run in my family so he could never really get a good latch. Our son does great with formula 




 I don't like to, but I use a case. The phone is so damn beautiful but it's just as slippery. I was using a supcase but now I use spigen slim armor  




 Aside from people I text that don't use hangouts, I probably wouldn't use that feature very often as I already have a Gmail tab open all the time on my PC  




 How does this compare to using motioninjoy for the ds3? I hated the finicky software. Half the time it seemed like my controller wouldn't connect and it felt like there was noticeable input lag. In addition to that, needing to translate the onscreen buttons to be relevant for a playstation controller since games always showed the xbox buttons. 

I really like the dualshock 4 but I REALLY like being able to use the 360 wireless controller adapter and just turning the controller on and being able to use it immediately, wirelessly, and without any setup. Just the other day I discovered I could use the controller for XBMC, I hadn't even thought to try it 




 Risky click  




 Last place I rented we technically weren't allowed barbecues, but luckily everyone had one and the property management company and the owner never enforced it because up here grilling is an all year thing, even when buried in snow  




 I guess we'll have to watch for this. Our son won't sleep without a sleep sack. We have to keep arms inside of it because they agitate his face when he's trying to fall asleep and that keeps him awake and makes him upset 




 Probably whatever subreddits the creator set it to watch  




 Not fooling me with dQw4
