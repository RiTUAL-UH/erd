 Soooo... you're saying the entire European continent doesn't count? What about Japan and South Korea? 




 Considering the iPhone 6+ has split screen, it's a matter of time until it hits the iPad. 




 It doesn't matter if you're technically correct. When people see a tablet they think tablet price. That's the fatal flaw that Microsoft has in the Surface Pro. 




 I think my point is that the "quality" of the product quickly plateaus as you increase in price. Is there that much of a difference between a $30 dollar bottle of wine and two buck chuck? Of course. But do you think there's a difference between a $500 and $100 bottle of wine?

Also, coffee is a low-price commodity that is bought and traded for pennies. It's a total marketing scheme that they can charge $5 for a cup when you can get it for less than a dollar (for approximately the same quality!) around the world. Can you say that a coffee bean that is meticulously prepared, roasted, and brewed is 200%+ better than what you get at Starbucks?

The worst though, is Illy. At almost $20 for half a pound of *pre-ground* beans, it is highway robbery. 




 I live in the Bay Area. This place is the home of overpriced coffee shops. $5 for a pour-over from some ostensibly superior coffee? Bitch please, it's just ground beans and hot water. Maybe I'd be more interested if you show me some papers that you're paying farmers 100-200% more rather than bragging about how much better the coffee is. 




 Why wouldn't they spend it on lobbying and lawyers? Their entire business model relies on changing how transportation is regulated. They would be stupid if they didn't do it. 




 Delta could make a move to disrupt the airline industry, but they don't. 




 Better than whom? There were plenty of Irish, German, Jewish, and Eastern European immigrants that did pretty well but the vast majority of them were poor as shit in the beginning of the 20th century. There were even wealthy black people amongst the other 99% who were poor. How they progressed through the century wasn't really any different than Asians.

My point is that as a whole Asians are given this stereotype that they are the "model minority" when it has really a lot to do with external factors and the fact that you can't easily identify all the white immigrants. At the end it comes down to economic and social class. 




 I think you're missing a pretty huge part of history. The reason why Asians (and other minorities in the USA) have it much better now is because of the increased social mobility they have and also because they're generally much more affluent when immigrating to the USA. If you look back ~100 years these people lived in the ghettos of society, kept to themselves, and didn't integrate much. You can still see this today if you go to poorer districts of Chinatowns, where ghettos and triads still thrive.

One of the biggest determinants of integration is class. Nobody (meaning white people) welcomes you with open arms if you are poor and struggle to get out of the trap, but all of a sudden they think you are a model citizen and are a success story if you start making some money. 




 You're perpetuating a misconception about Chinatowns in the USA. They were historically extremely crime ridden. These communities also kept to themselves for ~100 years. It's only today that they've gotten better when some of them got more affluent and also when more well-off Asians started moving in in the late 20th century. Do you not remember the days when Asians built the railroads? 




 There's a great proverb: "Trust but verify." You are indeed advocating for victims by corroborating stories and compiling evidence. The ones that lie are taking advantage of ones who actually suffered! That is how truth and justice works. We should encourage everyone to come forward and speak up, but we should also be vigilant against liars. 




 Grew up in Edmonton. It's a huge issue because you don't want to fucking die while walking through the outdoor parking structure to the hospital. Also snow/ice and people who are ill do not mix. 









 I don't see how it's possible to make a terrible* movie based on a well established franchise. I mean, they've made several Transformers movies already and are going to make more despite the fact that they are awful. You could make the literal opposite of ANH and that would sell like hotcakes.

*Terrible in the corporate sense -- meaning a flop commercially 




 Why would Nintendo care about DS sales if their games will run fine on Android or iOS? If they come up with an emulator that runs flawlessly, then essentially they've passed on all hardware costs to Apple and Samsung. They would make pure profit from having a massively increased audience and no manufacturing expenses. 




 What? I think it's pretty clear that most of the increase in GDP has to do with the massive government involvement in the recovery (eg. TARP 6 years ago) followed by many years of aggressive quantitative easing. That's pretty much as centralized as you can get in a country like the USA.

The reason why so many people are still strugging to be in the middle class or are in outright poverty is because the easy money that the Fed provides mainly affected the business side (and largely big businesses at that). Their hope was that these businesses would create jobs which would increase jobs and consequently wages. The latter didn't quite happen, because labor is not in a good negotiating position to demand higher wages.

All in all it's pretty much the textbook definition of a command capitalist economy, where the government and associated centralized institutions have a large say in directing where the economy goes. They got a lot of things right in the past few years in terms of improving the economy (compared to virtually every other country), but they could have spent a little more effort improving downstream metrics like wage growth. 




 I feel like shoot to kill is a purely American thing. Even in private lives, Americans have the constitutional right to be executioners in many scenarios. 




 And that is the problem with law enforcement. How is permission to execute when a fight starts any reasonable path to forming trust in communities? Especially if they are working in a community ravaged by poverty, crime, and police brutality. There has to be some nuance in firing a gun. 




 I think part of it is that American law enforcement and even private self defense hinges on the right to lethal force. Which is insane. Even in the UK when you had that terrorist knife attack the police didn't charge in with guns blazing, and fired 8 shots instead of 50 like you see here in America. Here when you feel like you are in danger or if the perp is gonna fight, you have full rights to be an executioner. 




 Not an MD, but is this official protocol? My impression would be that if "the man" at a hospital hears of this, they would go apeshit. 




 Not an MD, but many doctors that I know in their mid to late 40s have deteriorating eyesight. I'm sure many of them will have extreme difficulty in reading the fine print on a vial.

The question is that there should have been multiple redundancy layers against failure. If the pharmacist didn't catch it, why didn't the nurse who fetched it read the label? 




 Some drugs are just insanely expensive. Things like monoclonal antibodies are really difficult to make in large scale. Small molecules may be comparatively easier to synthesize but it's a long road to get to something that works and gets past initial screens or Phase I.

Those who say that marketing takes up a huge portion: well, yes it does. But even if you assume that a drug which costs $3B to develop took up $2B for marketing, you're still left with $1B for the actual research itself. That's the equivalent of ~1000 NIH R01 grants.

You could argue that funding 1000 academic labs could yield better results. Certainly big pharma R D moves slow -- that's why things are quickly moving towards academic spinoffs and acquisitions.  




 It also goes the other way around too. There are many people on the left who are prone to characterizing people on the right as gun loving religious nutjobs. Many people on both sides have a knee-jerk reaction to issues like gun possession, subsidies for the natural resource/farming sectors, and religious freedom. 




 What kind of lab work is it? Theranos is a promising startup that is going to have booths inside Walgreens -- they claim they can do all kinds of routine tests with a drop of blood and a fraction of the cost. Currently valued at several billion. 




 Usually vocals are on the center track, so a quick and dirty way is to phase out the left and right channels using something like Audacity. 




 Da fuck... I thought that was a real JT song... 




 Not a medical doctor but I work in academia and closely with academic medicine. Notes should be concise and give exactly the information you need. When I write notes I often think about the perspective of another person reading them. Unfortunately a lot of people don't put any thought or effort into it. Proper note taking takes a lot of practice. 




 Change is possible! California now has the jungle primary and I think several other states are following suit. 




 Not to mention that the smartphone market, while growing, has seen punishing margins for every Android vendor. Only Apple is making a decent amount of money.

The tablet market is slowing down worldwide due to similar reasons, so I'm not sure how Nokia thinks they can make money off of this. They have to go low margin/high volume but that means gunning after the low-end Chinese market of which there are many players already. 




 Now that .NET is going open source, is there any reason moving forward for developers to invest in Java? Personally I found C# to be a much more pleasant coding experience with the exception of poor platform support outside of Windows. Now that point is now moot it will be interesting to see where developers start to move towards. 




 I like wearing skinny jeans. My long-term girlfriend of 4+ years thought I was pretentious and gay when we first met. Turns out that one of those two things are wrong.... 




 Religious exemption doesn't give you a pass to break the law. I mean, maybe if you're part of a Christian church, but these guys aren't. If the CoS owns the police in the area, then why aren't the feds or state troopers stepping in? 




 This is actually an excellent point. A child may be able to speak fluently but the topics and level of articulation is extremely poor. Even teenagers in their last year of high school can't read or write with any level of sophistication as compared to a scholar.

If an adult were able to spend as much time learning a new language as a child, they would easily do better simply because the drive and level of articulation is so much better.

Similarly, you could extend this to any other type of education. Plenty of people become masters of their "craft" when they are well into adulthood. Students in graduate school do their best work in their late 20s and onward. 









 And there are still those that complain that he doesn't donate enough by percentage (compared to "regular folk").

His total donations to date eclipse the endowments of most large nonprofits combined. 




 YES!!!!!

 As far as I know they brought in the author to help fill in the gaps. 




 Here's the thing I think a lot of Republicans don't understand: the US government, through programs like food stamps, are directly subsidizing companies like Walmart. If they were really so gung ho about getting rid of social welfare programs then they should be all for massive increases of the minimum wage. But they won't, because they're not ideologically consistent and just assholes. 




 That's not really the point though. There are plenty of people who drink a six pack every day. Sure, their brain won't look exactly like the bottom panel but having even 50% of that condition is terrible. 




 Even if it were down to bare bones profits of under 10k, flippers like this can make a lot of money from volume. It costs practically none of their time because they're hiring someone else to do it. If you have a good office manager who can coordinate teams, then it's practically free money and gives good money to laborers.

Plus, you won't have a house smelling like cat shit sitting around in a neighborhood. 




 Not sure what the big deal with a visual code is. starbucks has something similar with great success. 




 If they aren't already genetically predisposed to it (via a hereditary mutation), you can give them a mutagen in their drinking water/feed for a few days. 




 holy shit... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomepizole

I have the Asian flush, so this could really help with it! 




 So what happens if a drunk person took Fomepizole? They would stay drunk for a long time because the alcohol isn't being metabolized? 




 Canada will never turn into the US with the racist scaremongering. Why? Because Canada's minority population is vastly more affluent and educated than compared to immigrants in other countries. Because Canada has a long history of multiculturalism. And also because Canada has a very vibrant community of moderate religious folk. 




 I'm a guy and I had really bad cystic acne. Like large lumps all over my face. I took Accutane and now it's mostly gone (I'm 30 now), but very few people have made fun of me over it.

If you have friends teasing you about acne then you need to get better friends. Especially if you are younger or in college. It's not worth your time to be around that kind of person.

Personally, I don't care if a girl has acne or not. What I will point out though, is if it's a severe clinical problem that should probably be treated with antibiotics or Accutane or birth control. But if you are breaking out here and there on your face? Who cares? I'd be more concerned with how the makeup is making it worse. 




 What if the makeup is causing the redness and inflammation?

There are lots of OTC products that can bring down redness and treat acne without covering it up.

Also, I don't see how you can properly apply acne medication during the day if you have makeup all over your face. 




 For all people who are saying that the future is disappointing, just look at all the biotechnology that has appeared in the last 30 years. It's basically the computer and space age of the 20th century. 









 Just read the Wikipedia article for the Enabling Act. How is that even possible in the 20th century? I'd imagine other countries like France, UK, and USA would have a really hard time pulling it off.

I mean, even today with civil liberties on the decline it's pretty much impossible to completely dissolve the separation between government branches and to ban parties. 




 What a pretentious asshat. 




 I feel that Mao's greatest mistake was not quitting while he was ahead or consulting people who were more qualified. Which is like the standard MO for most communist dictators. 




 I mean, they still could -- they just need to be wearing thick rubber gloves and a hazmat suit. At the very least, and because these are cultural traditions that should be considered after all, you can wear rubber gloves and wash them off with bleach afterward. I wonder if that was ever communicated to the family members? 




 http://ycharts.com/companies/IBM/net_income

IBM makes plenty of money. 




 Isn't this a really big win for Globalfoundries? It doesn't have the design IP but it gained a lot in the manufacturing IP, which will be useful for licensing out or even for incorporating it into ARM and x86 processors. That is, unless IBM is already licensing manufacturing technology found in Power/PowerPC to other foundries already.

It would appear that AMD could really gain from some of the IBM manufacturing IP to give their chips a little edge. 




 When I fall asleep (even naps) I start dreaming in seconds. I get uncontrollably tired during the day, but only if I'm unstimulated. Does that sound like narcolepsy?

In college and grad school I also fell asleep in almost every single class, and I would have desperate urges to lay down (in public!!) and fall asleep when I was out and about on campus. 




 How did you not kill him with that move? That's a lot of pressure on the spinal column. 




 The US basically subsidizes everyone else's military budget so that they could spend it on something else. After WWII, the US was pretty much the only country standing that could fight Russia so they poured money into their military when countries rebuilding in the West couldn't. That never stopped as we move into the 21st century and I think a lot of people forget that.

It also has the interesting side effect that the US now can project a lot of force around the world. However, I think that if other Western countries want the USA to wind down their military ambitions, they need to start ponying up their own defense budget. 

For example, the US spending in NATO dwarfs all other European countries, and yet the main purpose of it was to buffer against Soviet attack. It was also deployed in Bosnia, which is in Europe. European countries should contribute proportionally to their own defense. 




 Aren't large lobsters supposed to be lower quality because they are older and the flesh is tougher? 




 You mean like all Trader Joe's stores? I don't understand how they have so much fuzzy fruit hanging around. It's cheap, though. 




 The NYT has a great piece on the ACA today, about how the bronze plan (and some silvers) is a nightmare for low income people.

The ACA has a lot of good legislation in it including things for preventative care and pre-existing conditions, but it is a shit sandwich when you are poor as fuck and are forced to buy a shitty plan that makes you pay a $6k deductible even if premiums are subsidized. 




 Not to mention that the NIH plays ball with universities that charge exorberant overhead. The NIH drives policy and they have real power. If they said "we are only paying 10% overhead starting in FY2016", then you sure as shit will see Universities actually start to pay for departments out of their gigantic endowments instead of relying on soft money for everything. You'll magically get a ton of money for extra grants too. 




 I do NGS all the time in the lab -- there's really not that much difference between kits when you're sequencing exomes at 100x to account for false discovery rates. You're going to pretty much hit everything. The problem with the SureSelect kits are that they cost a ton of money. Illumina has a nice "Rapid Capture Exome" SKU that lets you do a multiplexed exome capture if you BYO Illumina multiplexed library for $300/capture and just use the Nextera enzyme for another experiment.

Also when you're looking at diseases with a very strong phenotype, most likely it is exonic and that should be the first line diagnostic before you do WGS because you will otherwise get too many false hits.

If you want to take it a step further, doing trio exome/WG sequencing for an affected person can really help you narrow down a mutation, regardless of whether it is inherited (by following pedigrees) or spontaneous (novel mutaiton not found in either parent). 




 But that's like saying all white experiences are the same, which is completely untrue. Obviously this person's is very different and shouldn't be painted in the same brush as what people refer to as "white privilege".

Also, this person is the poster child of diversity: a biologically female socially male person attending what an insitution that has a reputation to be an inclusive community for *women of all types*. I don't think you can deny that this person is part female and part male, which is as "diverse" as you can get.

The problem here is that you have a portion of college kids who didn't bother to have a sophisticated thought about (a) what diversity means beyond just "white" and "not white", and (b) what it means to be accepting of diversity itself. Then you have the NY Times and now this article painting a picture that there is a huge transgender backlash at Wellesley and other women's colleges, which may be (and likely) quite misleading. 




 Is that after tax? I'm a postdoc and I make about that much. 




 I'm pretty much the opposite of Libertarian, but if I were an American citizen I would vote for Rand Paul just because he seems like the only politician who is serious about reform.

Then again, Obama promised to shut down Guantanamo.  




 First of all, you need to at least complete your residency and be board certified. No matter what. You will command a larger paycheck which will help your student loans. Stick it out for a few more years.

Secondly, if you hate clinical work then no matter what you do you will hate fields like Radiology and Pathology. You're still hanging out at a hospital or a facility talking shop to doctors all day. That goes for academic medicine and research.

My recommendation is to go into something bioinformatics or hospital administration. These are somewhat removed from the day-to-day clinical medicine that you hate, but at the same time requires skills that you learned in med school.

You can also work as an in-house consultant for pharmaceutical or biotech companies. They need all kinds of people to help with clinical trials as well as basic strategy development. 




 The WMDs were circa 1991. Basically, not only could the US military/intelligence not find any from Saddam Hussein's purported "active WMD program", but they couldn't find any (which they helped manufacture!!) from over a decade ago. 




 Keep in the mind that this is the agency that found vials of fucking smallpox in a storage closet. 




 Not just that, but literally it only took THE FIRST infected non-healthcare person for the hospital system to break down. And shortly afterward, a healthcare worker was infected.

It's another thing when you can say "hey, this only happens 0.0001% of the time and we've handled millions of these cases in the USA". It's another thing when the entire health care chain breaks on the first try. 




 If someone straight up offered me $140k? Maybe.

But this house was already selling for $2.1 million. The other 140K would be chump change. They should have kept the cat. 




 The even more annoying part is when you compare their reaction to the swine flu outbreak a few years back. Total night and day. Sure, one is way more easily transmittable, but the other will fucking kill you if you aren't careful.

All the CDC is saying right now is "hey don't worry, we've got this" rather than outlining the specific steps people need to take to stay safe. Things like washing your hands, wearing face masks, infection latency, symptoms to be worried about, etc.

They're just doing PR when they should be educating. 




 End of Cold War, Round 2? 




 Pretty sure it's going to revolve around the Scarlet Witch/Quicksilver reveal in the next Avengers -- maybe around the fact that they are impossible to "control" by SHIELD/US government. It turns out that these Miracles are appearing because of something due to the infinity gems and the gauntlet. Iron Man, being a micromanager, proposes a registration list for all "Miracles" that are found. 




 They would also save a ton of money in lawyer fees in the long run too. Spending a few tens of thousands to contribute to a cover design (that's highballing the cost) would be much higher than paying a lawyer to litigate. 




 The Judge? Really? It's getting not so great reviews on Rottentomatoes. 




 I work in biotech and have done lots of genetic modifications on bacteria. Labs next to me do it on yeast. In my old lab there was a big lab doing synthetic biology. People are engineering human cell lines for specific mutations to look at disease phenotypes.

What I'm getting at is that genetic engineering, while still in its infancy, has the power to do some pretty amazing stuff with not that much effort. But with that power comes a lot of responsibility. If people wanted to, they could probably make a plant that secreted an antibiotic during growth so that Salmonella contamination would be less likely. It would be trivial, but would have huge ecological effects. 

Scientists should advocate for not just a simple "GMO" label, but for responsible labelling that is not that much different from the ingredients in our food today. Everyone in the "food chain" needs to know what genes are being inserted. It needs to be transparent. 




 It's a bit worse than that. They pump poo up your butt every day for at least a month. 




 Unpasteurized milk started to become a big problem when farming went "industrial scale". Unless everyone is willing to raise cattle in very humane conditions, it is impossible to deliver unpasteurized milk at sufficient scale to make the health benefits outweigh the sanitary risks. 




 Not to mention that a "typical" fecal transplant consists of them flushing another person's poo inside you every day for at least a month. It's a laboriously intensive procedure, which is why the pill is so promising. 




 Canadian here. There are huge swaths of Canada that are just literally nothing but plains. Then you get into Ontario and the scenery is not that much interesting either. 




 The only feasible "modules" would be swapping of the screen and maybe one peripheral. Otherwise this is another project that I can see Google retiring to their graveyard. 




 I don't necessarily agree with the statement that antibiotic research is stagnating. Maybe that's the case in big pharma, but there are many biotech startups in the Bay Area and in Cambridge MA that are heavily pursuing new classes of antibiotics and novel variants of classic ones too.

What you are seeing is part of a larger symptom of big pharma being too bloated to perform effective R D. For the past 10 years now we are moving to a model where smaller startups (spun off from a University) perform the initial proof of principle with any kind of drug. After this, one of two things happen: (1) the company/IP is then bought out by a larger company which has the expertise to perform all the clinical trials and bring it to market; or (2) the startup itself decides to bring the drug to market itself. 




 I went to one of the top Ivies for my PhD. I didn't think it was particularly competitive at all. We were encouraged to collaborate (from first year graduate problem sets to thesis projects) rather than shut ourselves in. 




 I also did my PhD from Harvard and had the exact opposite experience as you. What program were you in and what kind of undergraduate exposure did you get?

Not to say that the whole networking thing is wrong, but to say that there were truckloads of dumb undergraduates is untrue unless you were coming from one of the most elite colleges overseas. I went to a large undergraduate school in Canada and the distribution of abilities between schools is not even close. 




 I went to a school with about 40-50k undergraduates in Canada to one of the best schools in the US for graduate school. Honestly, the biggest difference was the lack of competitiveness amongst my graduate school cohort. We were all in it together, and we checked our pride and shame at the door. 




 Did you know that the top two Ivy League schools have free tuition for undergraduates? The percentage that are rich enough to "qualify" for full tuition is actually quite low. 




 I love house centipedes! I had one in my old apartment and never saw a pest. 




 I guess my point is that there are plenty of major hospitals and huge amount of primary care clinics that are private practice/for-profit centers. Many of these provide decent care, but they are also there to make a buck. Does that impede care? Certainly for a lot of procedures, but I believe that you should triage care whenever possible. The vast majority of acute and non-life threatening cases can be handled by a minute clinic or a "Walmart clinic" -- it will free up space at more capable hospitals and improve care for those who really need a lot of attention.

Just think about flu season. Many people roll into primary care or urgent care to see if they can get antibiotics because they're (a) scared or (b) worried that they might have a secondary infection. Walmart/CVS clinics would be able to do a quick triage and maybe even perform lab tests! This would remove a lot of burden on the health care system. 




 I think that's very idealistic thinking. If you are running your own or working for a private practice, you are absolutely thinking about making money. You'd otherwise go bankrupt. And think about the nightmares with billing with hospitals and healthcare providers. They are in it to save lives, but let's not kid ourselves here -- there are hospitals making a lot of money in profit and are very happy to make more on the backs of patients. 




 I think the problem is that primary care makes so little money anyway, why would they care about people coming in for the flu or with other acute non-life threatening conditions? They want the patients with serious or chronic diseases because (1) it's more interesting, and (2) they will make more money.

A lot of things in primary care can be really separated into two categories -- one is conditions where nurses are more than qualified to handle, and the second is one that absolutely requires a doctor.

A minute clinic is great because a lot of the first category can be taken care of in very little time, and you get huge cost savings from local competition. It doesn't take much skill for a nurse to take a swab or a blood draw and send it in for culturing either.

This has the other advantage of unclogging primary and urgent care clinics. 




 I think this should be one of the top responses. When NK falls, the citizens will see that they lived in these conditions (which really got worse in KJI's time after the Cold War) but nobody did anything to help. You've got fucked up shit happening in Africa and the world still engages somewhat. You've got a mixture of bombings and diplomacy in the Middle East. But North Korea? "Fuck it, it's someone else's problem." The average North Korean is going to see that nobody gave a shit about their lives or how much they were suffering. 




 As a CEO, he actually has a legal obligation to defend his company against disparaging attacks. Remember that OP was the one who accused Reddit of "reputation laundering" first and violated the terms of the non-disparagement clause. At that points all gloves are off and any CEO worth his or her salt would go to the nuclear option. 




 I think from a technical skills point of view: the top 1% of software engineers have an incredible algorithmic skills. Anyone with a degree can code out a program that someone else spec'd out for them. It takes another person to be able to come up with the process.

PageRank is a great example of this. Another is probably song matching with your smartphone. 




 By viable they mean can carry to term. Just because a sperm can penetrate an egg doesn't mean it won't spontaneously abort after a few cell divisions. 




 Man, I'm so glad to hear that obnoxious Americans have dropped off that list. 




 Not to mention that human anatomy is something you can take in sophomore year of college. Many schools even let you do cadaver dissections in advanced undergraduate classes, if not in medical school. Now imagine if you were only doing that for a few months -- you'd figure out where everything is pretty fast. 




 Broken ankles sound like a suicide attempt. 




 Holy fuck, I'm surprised nobody's addressed this possibility. 




 Way too late on this, but I've seen many farms here in the US have a llama for the same purpose. 




 The problem is that this approach isn't intellectually consistent with religion. If you interpret it as being "this is where we want our religion to go", then you lose the concept of a single "fundamental truth" that is codified in all religions. Certainly religions, like many cultures, are manifested as "living" and "evolving" over time, but no person who represents or believes it would explicitly try to push his or her religion in one direction or another.

Just like the whole stoning people thing in the Bible: people conveniently don't talk about it because "times have changed". Do you really think that the Pope 1000 years ago really got up and said "Nope, we're not doing that anymore even though it's in the Bible?" I believe that religions change implicitly as a reflection of the surrounding culture. That is why when you go across the world, religions such as Islam and Christianity actually vary quite a bit.
