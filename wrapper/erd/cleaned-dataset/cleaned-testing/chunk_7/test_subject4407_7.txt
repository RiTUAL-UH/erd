 Elon Musk wants to build an internet for people on Mars. It will be part of a second internet in space, using satellites to connect Mars to Earth ahead of manned missions to the planet. 









 iPad Pro, which is said to have a 12.9-inch display to further bridge the gap between laptops and tablets. 









 HTC is planning to unveil a new smartphone featuring improved camera and audio capabilities, as well its first smartwatch during the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC), scheduled for the first week of March in Barcelona, Spain. 



















 Australian actor Hemsworth sheds his "Thor" costume to become Nicholas Hathaway, a "black hat" bad-guy hacker released from prison to help American authorities dismantle a criminal network. 









 A new study has found nearly half of those who drink alcohol in the United States have used one or more alcohol-interactive prescription medications that researchers say can lead to dangerous health complications and in some cases, be deadly. 














 The global heat streak of the 21st century can be explained with statistics that defy astronomical odds. 
























 More than 11 years after Beagle 2 was lost in the early hours of Christmas day 2003, scientists said they have now found the stricken spacecraft intact but only partially deployed just 5km (3 miles) from the centre of its intended landing site on Isidis Planitia, an impact crater close to the Martian equator. 




 The Beagle had landed safely after all, but it didnt have the energy to bark. The UK Space Agency has confirmed that the only British space probe sent to Mars safely landed on the Red Planet but failed to fully deploy its solar panels for a successful radio transmission. 














 Solar power has come a long way from powering calculators to small electronics and now our homes, businesses and possibly the country. Currently roof top solar panels are dominating the solar industry and have become its flag carrier. 









 Musk plans to build a Hyperloop test track, approximately five miles long, and he plans to do it soon. 









 The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla wants to speed up the development of 800-mph tube transport. He's willing to pay for testing -- most likely in Texas -- to make it happen. 














 A team of researchers from MIT has now taken a novel approach to gaining such high-resolution images: Instead of making their microscopes more powerful, they have discovered a method that enlarges tissue samples by embedding them in a polymer that swells when water is added. This allows specimens to be physically magnified, and then imaged at a much higher resolution. 














 Urban myth that had US TV show Mythbusters weighing a truck full of pigeons on a scale and getting them to fly. Now it seems there's some truth to the idea that a truck driver carrying a cargo of birds can lighten the load by making the birds fly. 









 Using digital technologies does not directly cause stress, but social media can increase awareness of problems facing friends and family, and this stress is "contagious,". 









 Research in the nematode C. elegans in the Lithgow lab at the Buck Institute shows that iron accumulation itself may also be a significant contributor to the aging process, causing dysfunction and malfolding of proteins already implicated in the aging process. 









 Microplasma-gold nanoparticles on a new, highly sensitive, test strip that enables early detection of heart attacks. 














 In a study published today in the journal Nature, the researchers show how the nearby presence of polar (water-attracted, or hydrophilic) substances can change the way the nonpolar hydrophobic groups want to stick to each other. 









 Previous techniques to align the nanotubes resulted in less-than-desirable packing density, or how close the nanotubes are to one another when they are assembled in a film. However, the University of Wisconsin-Madison materials engineers pioneered a new technique, called floating evaporative self-assembly, or FESA, which they described earlier in 2014 in the ACS journal Langmuir. In that technique, researchers exploited a self-assembly phenomenon triggered by rapidly evaporating a carbon nanotube solution. 


































 Physical inactivity is a cause of twice as many deaths as obesity, according to a major new study.

However, we can reduce our risk of early death simply by taking a 20 minute brisk walk each day, researchers from Cambridge University said. 
























 The discovery of a material that maintains a rechargable sulphur cathode helps to overcome a primary hurdle to building a lithium-sulphur (Li-S) battery. 

Such a battery can theoretically power an electric car three times further than current lithium-ion batteries for the same weight - at much lower cost, researchers said.  
























 Coastal developments in northeast Asia are threatening the survival of Australian migratory shorebirds, a study has found, with some species experiencing population declines of up to 75 percent over the last two decades. 









 Nanodiamonds have been added to the surface of a new "hyperbolic metamaterial" to enhance the production of single photons, a step toward creating devices aimed at developing quantum computers and communications technologies. 









 Rafflesiana pitcher plant's leaves form cup-shaped insect traps that look like a pitcher. When the rim of the plant becomes wet, it gets extremely slippery and ants walking on the surface fall victim to the voracious vegetation. 














 The computer is better than a friend or roommate at predicting personality traits given just 70 Facebook likes; a parent or sibling with 150; and a spouse after 300. 









 The first verbal conversations likely occurred between 2.5 and 1.8 million years ago and were about tool-making, a new study suggests. 









 The 3-dimesional photoboltaic or pv cell technology provides a new technique to increase the conversion of solar energy into electricity. This breakthrough is patterned using the light management principles in fiber optic devices, in which the 3D design is employed to trap sunlight in micro-photovoltaic structures where photons travel around until theyre turned into electrons. 














 Facebook users in the U.S. will soon receive Amber Alerts to help find missing children who may be located near them. 









 A team of chemistry and materials science experts from University of California, Santa Barbara and The Dow Chemical Company has created a novel way to overcome one of the major hurdles preventing the widespread use of controlled radical polymerization. 









 Data can be used to know where to add public transport and fix problems in roads, with project beginning in Boston 









 Australia has qualified for the Asian Cup quarter-finals after a scintillating 4-0 win over Oman. 














 Bedtime stories are invaluable for a childs development
Napping helps infants to develop their memory and retain new behaviours they have learnt, a new study from the University of Sheffield has revealed. 



















 Elsevier announces the launch of a new journal: Big Data Research

 METCO Global releases new series of nanotechnology children books by Mark Tomassoni to educate and entertain young readers about nanotechnology 



















 Scientists have demonstrated that a 2-D man-made material called a metasurface can perform spatial differentiation and integration, the two main types of calculus problems, when illuminated by a laser beam. 
























 Experiments led by Humphrey Maris, professor of physics at Brown, suggest that the quantum state of an electron  the electrons wave function  can be shattered into pieces and those pieces can be trapped in tiny bubbles of liquid helium. 









 Griffith University academics are challenging the foundations of quantum science with a radical new theory based on interactions between parallel universes.
