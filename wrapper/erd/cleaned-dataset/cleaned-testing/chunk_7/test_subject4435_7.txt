 Doing it now. 5:25am and counting. 




 It's like Scully's implant!  




 I'm not even fully a ginger, but man do I ever know the sun's true nature. 




 I just spent WAY too long googling lorazepam and irritable bowel. I'd be interested to see if it actually helps. 




 Why is there not more?!?!?!? My cousin sent me the link and I read the whole thing in 2 hours. PLEASE tell us what has gone on since! 




 1 - Creepy
2 - Bugs
3 - Places to hide
4 - Bears
5 - X-Files
6 - The Hills Have Eyes
7 - Wrong Turn
8 - Blair Witch Project
9 - half the stories on Nosleep
Basically just repeat those til you get to #374.  




 Yes sorry if I came off as a jerk. I was actually responding to them but must have clicked the wrong "reply." And I was talking about this sub. Nosleep is like my big dysfunctional family. 




 I'd have the police check around next door. Those sounds could easily be a burglary or squatter. Or wax Henry come to hang out with live Henry. 




 Dude. Follow the rules of GTFO. 




 Hey OP update soon okay? Hospitals don't usually end well for the folks on here. Can you give us any more info/details on the woman? It seems like this might have happened elsewhere, if there's someone going around taking out the doppelgangers. 




 We don't NEED proof here. That's not how it works.  




 Was it your last summer there because of the "murders?" Did you ever want to go back? If your dad has any stories you should post them! 




 Police. Call the police. Tell them you left your door open during a walk and now there's strange noises and your dog is acting like there's someone else in the house. It's better to have them think you're nuts, and know they didn't find anything, than it is to risk something happening to you and your animals. 




 Reason #374 why I don't go near the woods. EVER.
Hope you're doing okay, OP. Where were you bleeding from? Do you have any bites or anything? 




 With weapons and a guarantee of hand holding, I would join a large group expedition to check things out. 




 Also strange: living a (mostly) normal life and then realizing at 23 that sometimes you know stuff before it happens and that you have all your life but never anything serious. Til now. 




 I've always wanted to try DMT but having never done more than smoke a little weed and REALLY enjoy dilaudid, I've been chicken shit. This basically solidified for me that I'll never try it.
Be careful if you go back though. 




 I vote ingratiating yourself to them and learning the trade. If you can't beat'em, join'em! 




 That's actually how it feels in my head most of the time. Eat well, stay hydrated, advil helps the throb and lorazepam slows things down a bit. Trust me. I'm a part-time nanny and on contract with the petroleum board. You can handle this. 




 I wasn't so much saying you were BEING rude, as I was saying that being rude here is a very efficient way of screwing yourself out of an answer. I'm in Canada so maybe the rules are a bit different. I had an uncle who left the RCMP to become a PI. I hang out with car guys so I have had a plentiful helping of what cops are "really like" despite my healthy respect for the profession. Is there really no one on the force you could talk to? I mean even in passing just be like "hey remember that asshole kid who did that thing with the dogs? He just bought a leash and some machetes." I mean if all else fails you could go the vigilante route. 




 That's not how nosleep works bro. 




 I don't think I would have accepted Dean's explanation of his odd behavior when you went over there. Keep an eye on things and be suspicious of everything for a while. Remember how scared he made you? 




 Seconded. 




 Nosleep is a great place to ask for help but if you're going to be rude to the people here you're more likely to get downvoted to hell than actually helped. 
Otherwise, unless you're off the force for being mentally unfit or otherwise a danger to the public, maybe it's time to ditch WalMart and start a private detective business? So you can keep an eye on things and earn a bit of credibility with the police again so when things do catch your eye, you actually have somewhere to go with it. 




 Honey... you didn't go to the zoo. Can you go on a walk and find a policeman? Tell him about going to the zoo. He'll help make sure you have lots to eat. 




 God should probably reconsider saying stuff like that... it freaks people out. 




 Update us ASAP OP. How is Willow? 
Get her out of the house either with the police or her mum, get some friends round to help you gather up your stuff, get the cash, and get the hell away from there.  




 No it was perfect. Just what I needed. But I'd love to know more. 




 Take some time and get your thoughts together and then it's lawsuit time. 




 I did actually start crying at the part where you said if you've ever lost a dog, they're there. Some odd stuff has gone on tonight with my old dog's ashes and my new dog suddenly staring at the urn and wanting to lick it. You should maybe stop helping people get there early but thank you, because tonight what I really needed was to know that she's having fun and she gets to be a puppy again. 




 Are you... are you repeating the day? Or dead...? 




 Could you elaborate a bit on what you said about seeing what Darryl has become since coming back? 




 Talk to a counselor at school about the rain and how you've been feeling because of it. 




 As a nanny... this is terrifying.  




 Yeah dude they start filming this summer and FOX has signed them both on for a 6 episode run! With all the original writers and stuff too. 




 Someone please link this guy to glitch in the matrix. 




 Just a heads up this is probably going to get taken down as an "intro." 




 Just touch the garlic. You don't have to eat it. Stay safe! 




 Any tiny puncture marks anywhere on her OP? Needle sized up to about the size of a canine tooth? Keep her hydrated. Maybe also let us know your reaction to garlic in your next update. 




 Stay away from my animals or you won't have to worry about what you might become, unless you have particular worries about being worm food. 




 I know it's hard to imagine but... maybe you can feel her because of the connection children have to ghosts. And maybe that's why your husband moved her away, because she's interacting with you and it scares him. If what happened to you was painful that could be why thinking about it and trying to figure out what happened hurts you.  




 So true. We produce a never-ending supply of disposable workers who when they leave there come home and lead productive lives with their wives and.... fuck that who am I kidding. They come home addicted to drugs, living on welfare because being there teaches them ZERO marketable skills, and generally torturing an already struggling area. And you, my friend, are the first person I've spoken to who knows that's what's happening as well as I do. 




 I think probably burning her body and then mixing the ashes with some salt and spreading them around a place she liked. Maybe a good scrub down of the house as well, replace some flooring, new paint, breathe some new life into your place. It can do wonders for clarity and peace of mind. I'd also probably get a new bed, if money allowed for it.  




 Amazing.
Edit: Amazing rescue and beautifully captured imagery. I have very few memories that are that clear. Props OP. Glad you're safe. 




 You and Tom find the cadaver he was snacking on. There must be some security cameras down there. Contact campus police or whoever and ask them to look at the footage as something strange was going on when you walked in. I think people donate their bodies to the lab right? But there's a lot of legal stuff. The authorities are likely to take it seriously if you think tampering of any sort is happening. If campus police won't listen I suggest going to the Dean and involving regular police. Until then, keep the deadbolt in place and pee somewhere else. 




 I'm so sorry. Have you tried Ebay or something to find another? /3 




 It comes from eating human flesh in general. It's a prion processing disorder. You can also have similar symptoms from eating only one meat for an extended period. Things build up in your system over time. Colloquial knowledge tends to mix up Kuru and CreutzfeldtJakob disease. That could be where the misunderstanding came from. 




 Totally what made me think of it. PS. X-files is back for 6 episodes!
