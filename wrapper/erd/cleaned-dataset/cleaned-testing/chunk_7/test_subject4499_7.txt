 I'd start right [here](http://youtu.be/Dbih0Loe5HY) 




 Why would Blair shave his head? 




 Fair enough. 




 But can you hide it? 




 Nah, I'm good sir. 




 Me. 









 Awesome picture. It's kind of crazy to see how the bottoms of the 9's are cut off in "1919" to look like "ISIS". 









 $45 for the bundle, $49 for shipping (to Canada). I skipped it again, as it pops up at least once every 6 months. 




 Haha this is hilarious. 




 Haha thanks for that. No swelling or discomfort. I'll let nature take its course. 




 So my sister told me to do the opposite when my son was born, and I've been ever so slightly retracting it a little bit at tub time (from 3 months when she told me this to 26 months now). After reading this now I'm a little worried. Should I consult a doctor? I understand it's on me for not doing my research and trusting my sister who raised three boys. 

I also realize this comment might be a little TMI for someone's main account, but I could care less. 




 I submitted this last year and got downvoted off the planet. I'll never understand reddit.

EDIT: I rest my case. 




 Awesome work. Reminds me of Fever Ray. What's the story behind it?

 You're in the right sub if it's dreams of coolness you're after. 




 "Yer" 




 Nice. I'm a fan of tool inspired tattoos, however it's only a matter of time until someone comes in here and says "fuck your tattoos". 




 Could be a combination of both I guess. 




 His eye seems to be injured as well. Hoping he makes it through. 









 Now there's a crossover episode idea. 




 That enviably get torn into filters for someone's doobie.  




 I wonder if there will eventually be a MP playlist that randomizes games and game types. That would make for a neat action sack gong show. 




 Ok where can I buy this for my Halloween costume?

 Sweet Jesus! 




 I had a dream I was walking through a cutover in the forest whilst [Black Milk by Massive Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-adM-qOwI) was pouring down from the clouds. I found it both terrifying and awesome that it was happening. However, as Black Milk would probably freak some people out, I think I would go with [La Femme D'Argent by Air] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5bL_XbO64). 




 I still have to wait 2-4 more weeks. I've already picked up a another copy from HMV in the meantime. 




 If indie merch didn't fuck me on the last pre-order, I'd definitely sign up. I'll grab it at HMV. 




 I couldn't get past the opening credits, got a "this is going to be terrible" vibe. 




 In Canada it is. 




 Hannibal TV series is absolutely fantastic in my opinion. 




  Beat up my car with a sledgehammer on the radio to get in.

[I like you.](http://www.imgur.com/WbEQV6Z.png)

 




 Probably a smart thing to do. I keep telling myself it doesn't come out until November. 




 Good thing they put the possessed doll that can levitate, move around on its own, and cause bodily harm in a GLASS box. Whew, close one. 




 2-4 weeks (maybe longer) for international.

Source: I emailed them. 




 I won't be seeing it for another 2-4 weeks or maybe longer because I'm in the cold barren waste land known as Canada. 




 Yep. At least we're not being gunned down by ISIS I guess. 




 Come on up to the house 10/10 would bang.

EDIT: To elaborate, it's uplifting and carries the kind of message people need to hear during grieving times. 









 I had the same experience being in the same province. It did however take about 6 for Opiate to show up. 




 Haha you sneaky devil you. 




 The payment process has been completed and your order has shipped.

Oh fuck yes. 




 If I were a betting man, I'd say it's the same animator. Soon as I saw it I instantly thought of rejected too. 




 It was posted here a couple of years ago too.

 Hey thanks for this, as a non-facebook user I didn't hear this info. 




 This is the position I find myself in as well. I might just wait it out. 




 Does anyone else have a message other than this?

I read this as, **"Fuck you Canada, fuck you and your pleasant population."**

 




 CTF narrative from last night:

Red team up by one, I was playing defence with sniper. Team was having a hard time, abandoned post. Go hard after their flag, get it out of base, ours gets taken, I die, spawn, kill their carrier, return flag, team mates cap ours. 1-1, 4 minutes left, red team flogging us hard, I play defence with carbine on flag. Kill lots of them, they back off for a little bit, I jump on the mongoose and fly into their base, die immediately, repeat that 3 more times, 4th time in base, had enough back up to get the flag just outside of the door. Red plays major defence, everyone on our team continuously dies to touch the flag, catch a break and get it past the half way point. Clock is at 30 seconds left of overtime. Entire red team killing our carriers, not even 10 seconds left we get it in our base during a repetitive massacre. Every single one of us marched into the gun fire to pull that flag closer. 2-1 win for us.

First time I laid my controller down and exclaimed happiness aloud since halo 3. It almost seemed like everyone was playing to win for once. Something I rarely ever experience in halo 4. So much fucking fun. 




 Alastair Crowley connection? 




 It won't. That's a fantastic bottle. The Puscifer music videos are a ruse, everything else seems to have a lot of effort. 




 I came here to allude to this as well. It's just social commentary, one big joke. Art isn't art, it's a product. Turmoil was Van Gogh's inspiration, not filling a void in the market place.

It is fun though, and I do enjoy Puscifer. Especially among friends and drinks. 




 Thanks, I'll look into it. 









 +1 




 Also Aphex Twin. 




 Cyclops would have to head butt everyone shorter than him. 









 Good God people, give this man your upvotes!  




 Definitely the most recognizable. 









 You might have better luck with this question over at /r/radiohead. 














 [relevant?](http://i.imgur.com/RGzsDMq.png) 




 You can't carbon fiber patch aluminum structure. 




 Correct. The skin has been routed out, and therefore had to be structurally reinforced. 




 Hah 




 Two skin cracks in close proximity to one another on the side of the fuselage directly below the cabin windows. Both were removed, and the applicable repair was carried out. A "quadrupler" scab patch is 4 layers of treated, primed aluminum, of various thicknesses that are fit, drilled, and installed in accordance with the structural repair manual. 




 Repair design is based on the aircraft and most importantly the application. 




 Yes. 




 Yeah, we did that about 8 years ago. 




 737-200 SRM. 




 You'd be surprised how many of these are on the aircraft you fly. 




 /r/mildlyinfuriating 









 What's even weirder is that whist cross posting this, I found out that /r/lobsterotica exists. 









 The website is pretty shabby, but I've had such good experience with these guys. I can't promote them enough.

[http://screaminpaintworks.com/portal/](http://screaminpaintworks.com/portal/) 




 33.3% of their discography. 









 Will do. Thanks! 




 I have to give credit to my brother for the pics. He takes amazing pictures and doesn't really share them with the world. I did get permission to post to reddit though.  









 Woah, that's old. Thanks! 




 A wise man in this sub once directed me to this site, which is a pretty comprehensive list of everything tool vinyl related. 

[http://toolvinyl.com/tool-vinyl-buyers-guide/](http://toolvinyl.com/tool-vinyl-buyers-guide/)

As for record players, I'm in the same boat as you. I have yet to do enough research to make a decision. Good luck though! 




 Thanks, that's the registration though. Was wonder what the serial number is. 




 Have any idea what SN this is? 




 Agreed. 




 This is a good point. It would be funny if it were Maynard this entire time. 




 Yeah it was tough, thanks for your concern kind stranger. 




 [The Mysterious Stranger](http://youtu.be/BpaRouocBes) 




 I almost died when I read this. 



















 Shit, my bad. I didn't see it. 




 WHAT'S IN THE BAAAHHHHHHX? 




 Season 5 episode 19. 




 50 bucks to Canada for that bundle with shipping. Luckily I'd pay 100 if I had too. Thanks for the heads up dude, so fucking happy right now. 









 Teenage angst. I was 15 when Around The Fur was released.

However now that I'm an adult, their new sound really works for me. Not that I don't like the older material, but I'm glad they progressed the way they did. Similar bands of that era became irrelevant for me after I graduated high school.  




 [Wat.](http://i.imgur.com/A5UeAip.gif) 




 I had the opposite happen to me.
That's very odd. 




 I've ordered from them before, never had to pay customs. Not sure if it was a one time thing, or a mistake. Either way, it works out to be roughly equivalent to ordering from amazon it appears. My bad, I should have done my research first.  




 "No human being would stack books like this.." 




 My birthday is 11/11. Coincidentally, the first birthday I've been looking forward to since I was a wee lad. 




 Reminds me of dig dug.

EDIT: [dig dug](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Digdug.png) 









 Good work man. Keep it up. 




 Shit. My bad. 




 Trunk nebula gif is nuuuuuuts. 




 I seriously have no idea how. Why am I like this? 














 [Here they can be seen taking a break](http://i.imgur.com/A5UeAip.gif) 




 [Rose](http://youtu.be/vZajIU1K3dQ?t=1m22s) 




 They have fantastic suicide wings. Also Jen in the north T T is a great waitress, very sweet and good at her job. 




 [As I read through this thread](http://i.imgur.com/NUyttbn.jpg) 




 Nope ;) 




 I give up. 




 Sometimes common sense isn't common. 




 You're welcome ;) 




 The entire sub needs to upvote you for summing up all three bands so concisely.
