 My dad had a car accident at 16 in which he was thrown through the windscreen into a pool of burning petrol. He had no eyelids for a few months and his face ended up looking quite a lot like this guy's, minus the nose thing. 

He was in hospital for 18 months, and had time to come to terms with the fact that nobody was ever going to give him anything based on his looks. 

It turned out to be the making of him in a funny sort of way, he worked his arse off, married a fine gal and became a very successful guy. I've got a ton of respect for the way he carries himself and after the initial 'whoa' most people just forget it's there. He's never even bothered going back to get more plastic surgery to make it look nicer. 

Tough stage of life for it to happen but life goes on.  




 Your friend better not ever try riding in a one-piece rain suit. It either escapes at the neck and steams up your helmet, or it festers and ferments in there til you unzip your suit and drop everyone in the room. 




 You'll send him a sexy granny? 




 Just like I'm the king of the microphone... 




 Their wind noise reduction is almost unbelievable: https://youtu.be/HxVgmovTYjQ 




 Fuck the Cavs.  




 I use a pair of Sena 20s headsets - you can then either record straight to a prism helmet cam or a gopro with a gp10 Bluetooth unit attached - or i think they'll record straight into a smartphone with a Bluetooth recorder app.  




 Discerning players demand that the fuck be shuffled out of their decks? 




 Hey you! Yeah you. Nice chin.  




 Blow us a snot rocket and it'll all be fine. 




 BOATERCYCLE 




 ...duh? 




 That was my first guess too. Came to the comments to confirm, thank you sir!  




 Nice vid, could really do without clickbait titles in this sub though.  




 There are none the like of Bestbrook. 




 I can't get interested in an Aussie league with no Melbourne tigers in it.  




 Kung fu, swing dancing and motorcycling are three hobbies I've found to be very social. I'm sure there's a ton of others depending on what you're into.  




 You have red and blue lights flashing in your helmet? I'd shit myself! Also, set your gear shifts earlier on corner entries, you're unsettling the bike.  




 Great post, thanks!  




 Nice job. I'd stick a fat flat handlebar on it.  




 I'd vote for him. If harden wins, the whistle da real MVP.  




 Chemistry and stacking the team to the rafters.  




 I've got a mate with a tiny knob, he's got a great philosophy on it. I wrote a song about him, you might like the sentiment: https://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person 




 Did you deliberately pause that on a shot of Tiago Splitter? Because that thing sure looks like a splitter to me.  




 I'm starting to think that of all his vaunted abilities, team stacking may be the most important.  




 Nobody's asking no questions when it's business time. 




 Haha thanks! First answer that got into my thick skull.  




 You're right - but they're still awesome flicks.  




 Right there with ya. He looks like a fuckin' arsehole.  




 You got a gift there!  




 But then I violently attacked a woman.  




 Anything could've happened to that bunny. Split toning. I call split toning.  




 HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?  




 Am I going crazy? The shot you posted is nothing like any of the misty forest shots in the guy's website. No idea how you plan to get that feeling with such a wildly different shot.  




 Well, I think it was kind of a reference to the one-handed backwards reverse MJ did in 1988, except he threw in an alley-oop pass and went backwards between the legs. This is the one:

 Except he's much shorter, and dunks off one foot where 'Nique was a 2-foot power guy. In fact he looked absolutely nothing like Dominique Wilkins 2.0, except for the fact they're both awesome. 




 Sorry mate, I was ready to get on board until the Wiggins trade, and since J.R. Smith came across I've got nothing but contempt. It's just another grasping pop-up superteam.  




 Australia, whoever is beating the Cavaliers, probably Westbrook.  




 I've had a hubsan x4 and a syma x5. The syma cost 40 bucks and has been amazingly durable. I destroyed the hubsan in 24 hours. The ones without cameras are lighter and easier to fly.  




 My god she almost doesn't look real. 




 They'd need to give Vince an extra scorecard to hold up that says "I coulda done better."
 




 I say we bash 'em. 




 The East is gonna smash the west with dazzling fundamental peach basket. 




 That's a crash, not a close call. And it sure doesn't look like smart riding. Glad you got off with an easy wake-up call and I hope you pull your head in until your ambitions and your talent line up a bit closer, to paraphrase Casey Stoner. 




 In the face of the MVP, no less. 




 ba doooo doooo doooo 




 That cake looks more like your dad than your dad does.  




 So you're saying they have an offense but he's refusing to run it?  




 Chicago needs some kind of offensive system. I've only seen one full game recently - at the warriors - but the bulls hardly seemed to move the ball at all. One pass, maybe one screen, then iso Rose or Pau with zero off ball movement. Pau is great in the post but Rose was chucking up contested off balance jumpers all night - and it didn't look like he had a ton of other options.  




 Instructions unclear.... 









 I would have gone with 'aladocious' instead of 'alidocious.' 




 Well look at it. The right surface of the left rock is lit and vice versa. The light source is in the middle. If you wrap a 180 panorama around, the left side of the frame is looking 90 degrees to your left, and the sun is still back at 0 degrees,  so the angles makes sense.  




 I recommend having a go in a variety of awkward places you can look back and laugh about later. That's what being a kid's all about!  




 What if it's a 180-degree panorama stitch? Then it would make sense that the rocks on the right and left would be lit the way they are. 




 That 360 two-hand windmill thing would have been a stunner if he made it. 




 Some buddies of mine often go to Gasolina in south wharf to watch motogp/sbk. The guys there love their bikes, too.  




 Cheers!  




 I'm in town to do a few bike tests, and I thought I'd pick up a lid while I'm here. Cycle Gear? What's the best place to shop? 




 Let it be so.  




 This is where you offer to wear a homemade cock'n'balls hat and video yourself walking around a shopping mall if you're wrong.  




 You've nailed it... I'm an Aussie in America this week and it feels incredibly insincere and weird to have people constantly attending to me. I don't like it, I'd much prefer to be on equal footing with them. Mind you it's gone the other way in some of the fancy coffee shops in Melbourne, where the wait staff make it clear they feel like they're way cooler than you. 




 Ah for fuck's sake, really? 20% is the standard? Fucking hell.  




 Yeah man, the theatrics on the launch were unbelievable. 




 Clearly you need more stars.  




 Maybe, but a shit planner!  




 C'mon dude, it's all just meat and bones. You'll get over it. 




 Sold! 




 I stuffed up my travel itinerary and bought a ticket to the game, but I'm flying out 2 hours before tip-off. Gutted. Also, I can't resell on ticketmaster because you need a damn American credit card. So... Anyone here want it? 3rd row behind the Pelicans bench. :( 




 Wall formed, league fucked. 




 Well.... it's kinda nice.  




 I hear they have a coke machine now. 




 It might end up cheaper to rent a car after all - how bizarre!  




 Indeed - that's a wonderful tourer, one of the comfiest and most practical things I've ridden. Dunno if I'd really call it an ADV bike though, it's much more of a road bike.  




 Let me know if you hear any more about it. I might ring the Pistons box office when i get there.  




 Daaaamn 40 bucks each way ain't a cheap night out. :( 




 I guess I could rent a car if I had to, but is there an easy way to get out there without one? 




 Aussie here, excited to get tickets to my first NBA game, and maybe a second. I'm staying in the city centre and need to get out to the Palace for the Pelicans and maybe the Nets in the next few days. Google Maps is telling me it's a 3 hour, 4-connection bus ride out there... Whaaaaat? Is there an easy way to get to the game? What would a cab cost? Thanks for your help! 




 Yeah, for sure, it's a bizarre idea. But these are transcontinental tourers and that size makes things smooth and comfy on the road. 




 Yep and yep. I think it doubles as a torque extender for the other tools too.  




 Cheers for the kind words. This is no intermediate level bike, it's a monster. I'm gonna try to get hold of some of those 800cc Triumph triples, maybe a BMW F800 GS or a crossrunner. Til I've tried a few I can't really make a call. But they're all huge compared to a proper dirt bike - the KLR and DR650 are decent dirt focused compromises for road/trail touring.  




 I don't disagree with you - nobody wants to see my ugly mug. Unfortunately I don't always have time to go and make appropriate vision to cover every second of the voiceover, and a talking head makes for an easy edit. I've done plenty of others the way you've suggested but this time the bike was back before I had written the story. Sorry!  




 Cheers mate! 




 They sure are, man. Great once you get going but you better be real careful where you put a foot down. Gave me an appreciation for what our short-arse riding sisters have to deal with.  









 Nick the Dick. And he's flopping it onto a hot dog bun on a serving tray if memory serves. Great movie!  




 No amount of patents can convince me that hydrogen will take over as the next big thing. It's a pain in the arse to deal with, and a hugely inefficient use of energy.  




 It looks like they actually took it off his Facebook page. Luck it down folks!  




 LeBron could be awesome. He just doesn't wanna.  




 I've been riding more than 12 years. Take me off a bike and I'm still that kid.  




 You can say poo, you're on the Internet.  




 The 1980s Celtics plus Len Bias.  




 Dunk of the year? It's great, but he does something like this every other game!  




 If it makes you feel better, he's been phoning it in all season anyway.  




 White Australian here. Appropriation is one thing you could call it - another is that she acts like a complete fool. But hey, pop music wouldn't be doing its job if old people like me didn't think it was garbage.  




 You should have sex with him. If he likes it, he's a total pervert.  




 Did... Did I just hear you bitching about bitching about bitching? HOW DEEP CAN WE GO?  




 LOVE FIST! LOVE FIST!  




 I would love to see a video of this.  




 Let's just hope he doesn't take the *other* Paul George leap.  




 And now we can get back to not wanting to watch it.  




 Don't bother with the camera, they're absolute shite until you get very expensive and add a stabilising gimbal. They also weigh the quad down and chew battery. The same Sena without the camera is even better.  




 Except your skill at conjugation.  




 Personally, I lost my shit when I saw it melt away. I even called the missus over to gawk. 




 A buddy of mine used to work picking up corpses for the coroner. She said these kinds of deaths were way more common than you'd think.  




 Way i read it, he was giving his team a serve for how badly they got torched in the first half.  




 *predominant 




 It's rubbish. 




 They laid the groundwork, but the NBA rose and fell internationally with Jordan.  




 Jordan more or less *created* the golden age of basketball.  




 AKA 'the vaginalympics.' 




 Bands live and die on their lead singer - I've been in quite a few. And the most interesting people artistically are often complete twats. LSD, in the Van Halen sense, is very real.  




 That floater is Rose's skyhook. Unguardable, instant release, over 7 footers no worries. 




 Shows how much I know, I don't even think I'd star that one in Lightroom... 




 But he's sprinting that fast on snow and ice...
