 I dont want idra near OGN. MonteCristo and Doa are amazing as they are. 




 its a cultural thing from starcraft broodwar where fan girls would skip school to attend matches. They would hide their face in order to not be recognized. Add in cultural shyness and you get hidden faces 




 i kept yelling at him to use it! it was pissing me off 




 my dad wouldn't let me watch lion king because he thought hakuna matata was a curse word 




 i believe round of 16 is in studio 




 i hope it makes it to the front page just to show how much this community enables and celebrates this sort of behavior 




 Ap Euro History, AP US Govt, and AP Us History were all easy. AP Calc was a breeze. Ap English Lit/Lang where annoying I also took Organic Chem, Analytical Chem, and BioChem so that might be why I thought AP CHem/AP Bio were easier than AP Physics 




 and AP Physics.... never take AP Physics.

 i'm just happy to be getting a consistent stream from the ESL instead of all the stuttering delays you see on their LCS coverage 




 are they giving you a chance to get back into the bracket too? 




 it is..husky was saying it an mlg ago and when day9 asked him why he said tyler told him noonie is correct pronunciation.

 I love MonteCristo cosplaying Phreak.  




 catz streamed the first 3, where they tied again. may want to keep an eye on that stream 




 we are waiting for a group to finish..there is a 3 way tie between strelok, lucifron, and yugioh. They are playing out tie breakers. 




 because they have been the regulars on the new SOTG 




 Any one else experiencing this issue? 




 He went to Korea for the wcs announcement  




 A lot of the Chinese players have been doing this 




 Any time sundance talks i feel like he is lying/doing the corporate shill 




 the bracket also says a lot of people won their series 1-0 




 yes america is 1 qualifier..top 8 make the field 




 think you were a little too early with that  




 Siw wins both games versus XLord with overwhelming numbers of blink stalkers. Mental King showing solid mmm play vs targa 









 down again 




 Combine this with protoss also having control of very early game with the new available pressures/all ins available 




 casting from replays to accommodate Koreans even more. 




 I honestly don't understand why blizzard chose ESL...especially after being able to watch them botch the entire EU LCS for LOL.  




 I would like to point you towards reddit.com/r/allthingsterran :)


1. i transfer 4-6 ish, once my first command center is slightly below saturation i point both cc's towards second (or maybe even my third)

2. As I low down my 4th cc i tend to stop making scvs. I'm looking for an army of 60-75 ish supply most the time.

3. terran drops? usually a about 3 well placed turrets on corner of you bases will stop most but you can obviously play super safe with more. for zergling counter attacks i make a wall at natural and at 3rd ramps with bunkers by each(usually with 3 marines inside)

4. Thats a really broad question. go over to the allthingsterran subreddit and check out the [build guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1c9gbb/gosubuilds_update_1_month_after_hots/) 




 Did the party ever get paid for the brightblade mission or did the screw it up too bad? 









 violet is back in korea now(notably playing in GSTL ) 




 i was trying to frame it in a way a LOL fan would understand  




 Code S is the SC2 equivalent of LCS...or more accurately its like OGNLol. ALL the best Koreans tend to play there(and Koreans tend to be the best players). Code A is the "minor leagues"..these players have an opportunity to get into code S next season.

All the new WCS action will be available on twitch.tv in free 720p but VODS might be behind a pay wall(similar to OGNLol). 




 The fear was more noticed to me in the tavern mostly. You can say that to this point most merchants have been bartering with the party but since visiting dalomar this particular merchant seemed very gruff/upset(especially for someone who raised his price by 100 gold). I may be reading into it though.  




 The first thing I noticed about dalomar when he questiones the group was that he said lower LEVELS(plural). The group only went down one level so that clues me in to them missing something. Also, dalomar seemed relatively uninterested in the book and more interested in the contents on the keep. This leads me to believe the book was a red herring used to get the party to find something else.

I've noticed that sense the party visited dalomar that towns people have been swindling them and giving them distance. Ryan thought this was respect but I view it as fear...obviously the people are afraid of the group since they started talking with dalomar.

I think everything dalomar gave them was exactly form that script(wizards don't haphazardly do anything...just ask gandolf). The arrows and rope were supposed to be used to create a path for the party not touching the floor to not spring and traps, the oil for the acid coins, the torches BC he knew they would be descending levels into darkness, etc 




 Two questions...I noticed Dalomar said lower levels(plural)..yet the party only explore one lower level. Was this on purpose if you can comment on it..
2. Was the book they retreived actually the book Dalomar was looking for..furthermore...did dalomar even want the book. it seemed from his line of questioning he was more interested in the spirit 




 I'm logged into NA and I have been stuck searching for a match indefinitely. Is anyone else experiencing this? I would contact riot support but the webpage seems to be down.... 




 no but zerg players do. ZING!
 




 i had actually checked to not continue my subscription and still got charged the $30... 




 i should note i dont represent nasa opinions blah blah blah..but making enough noise with congress does make changes(see SOPA) 




 yup 




 sequestration cuts

 The correct answer is Naw-Fuck 




 i live in norfolk, va . well hampton actually but close enough 




 disappointing that wont be able to have a true midnight release party :( 









 basically you quit right as the hard part ended...the rest is all balance poses and your heart rate comes down and you can relax 




 I 3 you. FYI B1 spoils result of B2. 




 that EG Curse is strong. 




 merely fat that hadn't disappeared yet...i was 170 ish when that pic was taken and it takes me getting down to 155lb to appear lean 




 a little wider than shoulder width. Grip is the main problem but my back rounds like a mofo on my way down. doing some accesory work to try and strengthen it so i can keep my chest up. here is my [form check video](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/181kp3/form_check_squat_deadlift_bench/) from a couple weeks ago.  




 my goal is to not be weak ass. More specifically to meet the standards for the 3 main lifts. 1.5xbodyweight squat etc. i'm stalling at 115 lb press, 145 lb squat and 185 lb deadlift. done 1 reset on all and back to those numbers and still stalled. 




 actually i've been struggling with getting results from the heavy lifting thing. lol 




 these are my results from day 0 to day 90: http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5
The wasn't super strict on my diet the last two months and i skipped a lot of kenpoX days bc i was "didn't have time"

that being said i lost 25 lbs and was significantly more fit afterwards.

My one word of warning is that if you are the sort of person who has a hard time motivating yourself, you WILL struggle to do the entire program 




 it just looks wrong..both teams are making bans they just only appear on one side 




 yeah there is a glitch in custom games right now. it was happening on MLG prizefights last night too 




 they're either new balance running shoes or nike basketball shoes. don't remember which i was wearing last night T.T 




 sorry for being an idiot..fixed 




 * [bench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bIk0aeZinA) 5 reps at 95lbs
* [squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xji2zF0fNeQ) 5 reps at 115lbs
* [deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbHJl5pvNI) 5 reps at 135lbs

I did lighter lifts so I could really focus on my form. Any tips would be helpful. 




 i with i had people that would tell me my form sucked or if i was doing okay...I'm always unsure. 




 i hit level 30 with 0 normal wins...i always played intermediate bots until then 




 Lol fans love the DoA/Monte Cristo synergy. in LoL casts they are the opposite where Doa plays tasteless to Cristo's Artosis. 




 I'm still following my resolutions: No weight change :( but my lifts have changed:

Deadlift: 125lbs  --- 200 lbs
Squats: 85lbs -- 125lbs
Bench: 100lbs -- 120lbs
OHP: 55lbs --- 70 lbs

I'm doing beachbodies BodyBeast routine whilst adding in the SS lifts on appropriate days(i do bench before chest day etc) 




 I read this as "6 Western/Independent korean players" rather than as "6 western players and Independent Korean players" 




 if you want to kill it more do the DB Deadlifts after your high weight deadlifts. For example I did my SS style deadlift progression(45lb*5reps, 60lbs*4 reps, 95lbs * 3 reps, 135 lbs * 2 reps, 205lbs * 5 reps) followed by BB deadlift progression(25 lbs *15 reps, 40 lbs * 12 reps, 50 lbs * 8 reps, 40lbs * 8 reps) and continuing on with the rest of the BB back exercises. 




 yes. although it seems to have gone away of late for me if i stick to the lower resolutions 




 the walmart i go has 1lb ground turkey similar to this:

[ground turkey](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Fresh-85-Lean-Ground-Turkey/14089618) 




 I say skinnyfat as most people on this subreddit understand that means an ectomorph somatotype generally characterized by a pear body shape  with most my fat on my stomach. I'm very aware that classifies as overweight (hence why i'm working out ) :D

I will try morning time weighing and see if that changes things. 




 Every day before doing the BB routine, I do a SS style lift. Max Chest press, max squats, max deadlift, max OHP, max shrugs. I then do the BB routine as accessory work 




 mostly eyeballing while using loseit.com to track. for example. i'll cook a lb of ground turkey in a pan and then use half the pan and say thats 8oz  




 i went down to 188 and then recently popped back up to 190. I'm always weighing myself at 7:15pm before i eat dinner 




 I've definitely raised numbers on all my lifts(ex started at 125 for deadlift, cranked out 160 last night).
friday is my cardio/core day(specifically HIIT) 




 I'm a 5'11" , 190lb skinny-fat male. For the past month, I've been practicing my fork put downs(1800 cals, 50% p, 30% c, 20% f). as well as working out 5 days a week.

  M-max chest 3x5, chest accesory work, tricep work
  T-Max squat 3x5, more squats...even more squats. calf raises
  W-max deadlift 1x5, dumbbell deadlifts, rows, bicep curls
  R-Max OHP 3x5, shoulder press, lateral raise, upright rows, Max shrugs
  F-HIIT/core

Two questions:
1. Why is my weight not changing? Do i need to cut calories more? is my 30% carbs too much? Do i need more cals so my body doesn't hold in fat(that feels brosciency)
2. All my workouts last a little over an hour. sometimes i'm soaked with sweat(see leg day) and other times I feel a pump but don't sweat...does that mean i need to work out harder/longer on those days 




 I think it would be nice if everything submitted got auto-tagged spoiler until a moderator changed it bc a lot times spoilers are getting to the front page before being tagged. 




 Doesn't SK gaming have a major presence in Poland? 




 definitely check r/p90x out. I did it last year and lost 20 lbs and toned up a bit. ANd don't listen to the naysayers  you can definitely gain strength doing it if you push hard and keep trying to up your weights 




 MRN first appeared at MLG Anaheim 2012. many of us have been follwing since then. Especially since the owner is a member of the Fighting Game Community and the manager(DJWheat) is well respected by most gaming communities  




 the teams name is TowerDiveTv...hence TDT
