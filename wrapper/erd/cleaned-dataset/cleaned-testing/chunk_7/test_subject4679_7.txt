 Interesting to read these comments. As mentioned in the blog, I'm a psychologist who seems to have accidentally developed a specialty with this type of problem - through no planning of my own. Any suggestions/experiences you have might be helpful. I'd like to be able to quote you tho (without revealing identifying info or your handle) in my talk if possible.

In Welcome, Sato's problem seems to have been a combo of a triggering panic attack, low self-confidence, and uncertainty about direction. Once rolling, the problem was sustained with internet use (hard to imagine large numbers staying indoors for 4 years with novels) and - interestingly suggested in episode 23 - the luxury of a parent-supplied economic safety net.

Any thoughts about these, and suggestions for other causes or maintaining factors (rest assured I have many more - didn't learn about this from WTTN)?

The depressed frame of mind pulls a person to focus endlessly on what they DON'T like, whereas to move forward often you need to forcefully redirect your mind to what you WOULD like instead. A therapist can help with this. 









 Arguably not being cranky is a bit difficult this week, given the news in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it's often a good goal. 














 And yet, through hateful and hurtful means, Phelps provided a model for the logical extension of believing in Leviticus. In so doing, I think he inadvertently caused more people to rethink their homophobia than anyone in history.

Not a popular idea, but ultimately it can help to have your enemies behave like idiots.
