 A good pic with an even better story, I'm glad someone is at least fighting it, restored that would make a cool tiny house (my dream)

 Dammit, just what I'm looking for! All they have at the last place in my neighborhood is really old Dell garbage priced at $25 bucks.

 Just don't repost ANYTHING no matter how old it is. 




 All I want for those people are to do their jobs! If I have a question I don't care if they have been asked it a thousand times before, I just want a clear answer and if they don't know then tell me that. 




 WOW! Where the hell did you find this? Sweet! 



















 I don't know how that happened, thanks. 
























 I think the important thing id that everyone has a different vision with how they want their home to be. This is a very nice shell where people can add or subtract as they want. I like the size but I envision the plumbing all on one end and most important a bed on the floor, not a loft. Either a murphy or a roll out.  




 Sweet! Real nice. thinking of making one for the inlaws.

 I haven't made these but I plan to, but I have made cookies like these before. The WW flour will create a softer cookie with a softer mouth feel than a regular flour cookie. Try halving the recipe and giving it a try. A small bag of Whole Wheat flour is not that expensive and if you don't like the cookies you can look up muffin or quick bread recipes to try.

 He likes to grill his bread with olive oil on a very hot grill pan. I personally like it a little darker. 






















































 Have you seen this video, it has a lot very interesting information on the Tiny House Movement and on American Urban Policy itself. A must watch for anybody interested in the Tiny House Movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-zESacteu4 









 Another view https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udQvxmq7AhQ 




 Don't forget "Murder by Death" watch "I gotta go to the can again and I don't want to miss nothing!" at 2:50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szG35uyiiuk 




 That's the kitchen, and that's the kitchen table where they eat as evidenced by the chairs alongside. The table is steel because they also use it as a base to climb the ladder to get upstairs.

 I want to see the pic when one of these stunts go horribly wrong. Then the family can sue because he was able to get up there somehow. 




 Just keep the table clean for when you use the ladder to up and down. 









 (1) How the hell did I miss that the other day and (2) WhyTF didn't karmadecay catch that! 




 I didn't crop or change the pic in anyway. I just checked karmadecay with the pic as I found it. I checked other pics and they came up already posted. Odd. Maybe because of the nsfw tag? It's been well over 3 months so I might have posted it anyway because it's a cool pic. I can only go by what it says, right? 




 i found it on redass, thought it looked cool. Your probably right. 




 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059739 and I have to say they really compliment each other. 









 Man did he quickly disappear when those child abuse rumors popped up. 









 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059586 and again got some nice nsfw pics on karmadecay 




 Was on Lexington Av NYC waiting to turn on 59th Street, in front of Bloomingdale's, when a man wearing all white, White Hat, white suit, white shoes wearing a full length White Sable Fur Coat carrying a large Bloomingdale's bag erupts from the store's entrance and runs full speed headlong into oncoming traffic, dodging moving cars and quickly disappears into the 59 street subway station. Out pops two security guards a minute later but the guy is gone. I've wondered since then what the story was behind that mad dash. 




 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059451 and some nsfw pics popped up on karmadecay for this this pic.
