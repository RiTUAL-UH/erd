 Never been to one before but seriously considering it for the premium experience especially for a movie of this caliber. Is paying extra for gold class worth it over your average walk in cinema? 




 HOLY DAMN MY EYES! 




 Sounds your like your psu is dying and gta 5 is pushing it to the limit.  














 im gonna pre order it just to piss you off.  




 It will be on Origin.  Not steam.  




 And of course people still bitch about batmans voice. their never gonna get it right enough to please enough people. I thought it was bad ass. I hope they go through with it.  









 mine will. i7, 8gb ram, gtx 970. I'm ready for this game.  









 who cares! buy! 




 Star Wars and Batman V Superman. I'm in total geek mode right now! hype! 




 what about the people who got tickets to the imax event? kinda sucks for them . 




 works for me.  




 new link! http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=118811 




 Gone. These are dropping like flies lol.  




 and yours is gone too lol. 




 And its gone. Sorry peeps.  














 he doesn't get any say in whether or not they crossover. if marvel and kevin feige want it to happen it will happen with or without him.  




 amd cpus naturally run hot. 77C is nothing to worry about imo. when it gets 80c or above then worry.  




 crikey thats 2am my time. oh well. sleep is for the weak! 









 **** I hate reviewers like these. They try to be different for the sake of being different but don't express their own actual opinion.  




 the new force awakens trailer and star wars battle front trailer will premiere at star wars celebration.  




 Too late hes Doctor Strange and hes going to be awesome.  




 why? as long as Tom Cruise is physically able to play the role of Ethan Hunt keep making the moies.  









 Yea not right now but down the line mainly due to the fact that Miles doesn't exist until peter parker dies. so theres that.  




 So Is 3d bluray still a thing, and do people use it? if so whats it like? Also whats the current adoption rate of 4k tvs? have you guys moved to 4k yet or are you sticking with 1080p tvs? 




 Disagree. I still enjoy arrow but Flash has been vastly superior to arrow this season.  









 Could be a bad overclock. Did you overclock at all recently? 



















 Seems to be missing some movies.  









 War machine.  









 Reminds of  me of what happened with Patty Jenkins and Thor 2.  









 Hey ive got the same laptop. Asus laptops are great.  



















 Loud music at 6am.  














 Initially chose the wrong career path, ended up with 20k extra student loan debt that I didn't need. Now on the right path but I still regret that decision. wasted 2 years of my life. sucks man. I often wonder tho had I not made that first mistake would I have gotten to where I am now? maybe, maybe not who knows.  









 Loki in The Avengers. Hes got the joker elements but hes less serious I guess? not sure if thats the right way to describe him.  




 you sure its the thermal paste and that your cooler is mounted properly? 




 AMC indie spotlight.  




 Never. The animated movies are still really successful in their own right. 



















 you probably have a virus or bit coin miner that found its way on to your machine.  









 Don't get me wrong the MCU has had some cool villains not great but cool. Loki was fun and entertaining to watch kinda reminds me of the joker a bit. Bucky was awesome too. But Fisk is just on anothr level entirely. Every time he was on screen I was legitmately scared for our heroes whic has never happened in the main MCU films because we know our hero will survive because hes got another movie out the following year. Now I really want Fisk to shows up in the new spider-man movie that would be amazing.  




 Spider-Man as a meta for the audiences would be kinda cool.  




 A little more context please.  




 yep episode 4 is out now lmao.  









 because reviewers need to write their reviews in advance.  




 I haven't seen anything yet to indicate they have and with all the age of ultron press the cast need to do not sure how they will find time.  




 Civil War begins filming next month not Doctor Strange.  




 The Russo Brothers  




 Be pretty funny if it ended up being Doctor Strange.  



















 You know I think I saw that in a tv show.  




 I'm telling you man good manners get you far lol.  




 HP and the order of the phoenix.

 I couldn't believe he was that stupid when I read that part but it turns out he is. I'm just baffled.  




 I know. His last comment especially just infuriated me. He admits to being a PC gamer but then calls us bastards? wtf.  














 Ill miss the 20th century fox logo :( 




 Really? Id called that innovation but that's just me. 




 you cant brnig the guy back if he dosn't want to. These movies are exhausting to make.  




 I hope its true. The piledriver architecture that AMD has been using since 2012-13 is old and out of date and AMD fans have been wanting a high end APU for some time now. Hopefully they don't screw it up like the bulldozer chips.  




 The july date was given to spider-man since hes now part of the MCU.  









 Didn't catch on? explain why it made over 2 billion dollars then? I think people liked it for what it was not because it was trying to be a poor mans star wars.  




 he did say in the OP there is certain things he cant talk about so Thanos is probably one of them.
 




 Almost forgot how was Andy Serkis in the movie?  




 Ooh now I'm really curious.  




 Game of thrones and Daredevil in the same weekend. Hype.  




 In what way was it disappointing? did it not directly tease the next movie? 




 were you guys asked to lie or deny certain things about the movie? 




 Interesting. So I shouldn't believe everything I read on twitter then? since I saw someone say hes not in it.  




 Can you confirm if Loki or Heimdall appear in the movie? 




 Had to google this cause I never heard that Joss was actually pissed about it but it seems like he actually is from what I read which sucks because I think Idris was just excited and accidentally let it out I don't think he purposefully did it just for attention like some articles make out he did. If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.  




 you sure? it looks like the suit he was wearing at the end of winter soldier that he got from the museum.  




 Why did Dom just get up and awkwardly leave, and also where was he going and why didn't Letty go with him? I thought they were married? 




 I like how cap is wearing the old suit.  




 Bullshit it felt like a rushed movie it was almost 3 hours long lol.  




 Loki according to this guy. So did Idris lie about having a scene with Tom? or was it cut?

 Someones getting angry sex tonight.  




 giving presentations or anything that involves public speaking. fuck that shit. let some other schmuck do it.  









 Punch myself in the face 














 So Its ok to talk about GTA 5 but not COD? since when did you make the rules? 









 Punny.  




 tbh I wouldn't mind if that was the case. Disney has so much on their plate right now its insane. I want this movie to get as much development time as possible before going into production. 




 maybe rockstar shouldn't of taken so long in the first place. The reason alot of people will pirate gta 5 is cause they dont trust rockstar to make a decent port after what happened with gta4. its hard to care about rockstar in this situation.  









 Link? cant seem to find it.  




 I remember reading that Scott Derrickson was supposed to direct with CBS films financing the project. Anyone know what happened?  




 I agree with AD,Elementary,TG. Haven't tried Mad Men yet. Modern Family is not my thing but The Newsroom and Doctor Who are amazing.  




 Agree with this one. I tried watching the piot. I couldn't even finish it, it was that bad.  




  I was like this at first. Took me a few tries to get into it but once I did it was awesome.  



















 wait the video description says 13 episodes? I thought it was 10? 




 I'm actually curious to know more lol.  














 the camera makes it more cinematic.  














 How do you think theyll do it? Could it be as small as Hawkeyes cameo in Thor?

Ill dig up a story I still cant get over even years on

At my old repair shop job, we had a 27" iMac come in that the user said the DVD Drive stopped working, and it was out of warranty\user didint buy applecare so apple would not touch it

Some poking about later we ended up pulling a shitload of toast and crumbs out of the slotloader, we even tipped it up and shook it and such a large amount of crumbs came out after the chunks of toast we physically fished out left us stupefied, we instantly assumed the user had kids and the kids did kid things with the mac, and as a result the drive was toast (heh)

we told the user and he went all red and said "well, I uhh.. thought it was hungry"

"huh?"

"Yeah! Well recently its always been a bit slow when you turn it on in the mornings, like its tired or something, and I figured that I feel like crap until Ive had breakfast in the morning, and I have my breakfast at the computer desk so I thought it just needed a bit more energy, so I fed it toast!"


uwotm8


Mac users eh lol.  














 At the start of this episode John was trying to train Finch to use a gun of sorts, preparing him for when John is gone. Anyone else think they might of been foreshadowing his death? 




 bullshit. if you do it properly you should only have to do it once in a life time.  




 At least you have a job.  




 That's already out.  




 Dr strange is next year.  




 Damn it you stole my answer! lol.  









 Seen the movie a couple of times now and I'm eager for the bluray release. Any ideas when? 









 End of this week. The press screenings are on the 9th. 














 Anyone know if arrow will get a wondercon trailer? 









 Yes! Even though I play it on PC. Hearthstone is one of those games that should go multiplatform. I mean it kind of has already with the iphone and android. But Im surprised those happened before the console versions. Hopefully Blizzard gets around to it.  




 Thats a bad way to do it in my opinion. your basically starving yourself the rest of the day. id call that an unbalanced diet.  









 wait campaign? da faq? 









 make sure its signed in contract as well that way you can sue them if you ever have a bad day lol 









 Barry attacking Eddie is at 1:07 in the wondercon trailer. At least I think its Eddie it looks like him.  









 In the wondercon trailer we see Barry punching the shit out of Eddie. My theory is that Eobard Thawne decides to leave Dr wells body after realizing that Barry is close to finding out the truth he takes over Eddies body essentially killing him (like he did with the real Dr Wells) that's why we see Eddie killing those cops in the wonder con trailer.  









 Revenge of the sith, Quantum of Solace.  




 I lost the game! 














 6300 is a decent cpu 4300 should be avoided at all costs . 




 But the human eye cant tell the difference between a 7790 and a gtx 970.  




 This one.  




 Justin Lin is directing star trek 3.  




 Link doesn't seem to be working just getting a blank page.  









 is the money in your own account? if so then legally you can access when ever you want.  




 keep it! not sure how you just find a mobo with an i7 on it lol but kudos to you haha.  




 its trademe what do you expect.  




 But if he doesn't get a break till December that means season 4 wont be ready at all by the fall this year? 




 I've been thinking with Amell now cast in TMNT2 It'll be interesting to see how they will find time to film arrow. I mean unless Season 4 features very little of Oliver I cant see when they would film it if they still want season 4 to premiere in the fall this year. TMNT2 will be filming for at least 5 or 6 months that's not including the possibility of reshoots ether and Casey Jones is an important character in the TMNT story so its not like they can film less to accommodate Amell filming arrow other wise the story would suffer. I'm wondering if the addition of this new spin off show that features some characters from arrow is a way for the CW to fill the gap so at least the CW will have an alternative to Arrow if Arrow does need to take a break this year. Thoughts?
 




 Unfortunately it will. I'm not sure by how much though.  




 Too slow mate.  




 Like how many times did Toretto and Shaw ram their cars into each other for no reason? lol.  




 why does the carpet look like magets?  




 No its not.  




 Ryse son of rome is a fun pretty game if you like lots of quick time events and a cheesy michael bay esque story line . 




 is it batman arkham knight? what else is coming out?  




 So what was the deal with that? was that a subtle hint from the film makers that lucas black will have a larger roler in furious 8? Why didn't Sean go back to LA with Dom? maybe they just felt it wasn't right for this movie?  




 Monday to Friday its 10pm then awake at 4:15am. Weekends or holidays its when ever I feel like it . 









 Have you read the comics at all? if you haven't read the comics then X-men 3 is actually a pretty decent flick.  




 My recent obsession is Interstellar. Seen it about 5 times now. And when ever I'm doing something on my computer I always have Hans Zimmer's score in the background. Its just so damn good.  




 Excellent choice! 














 grammar natzi irl eh.
