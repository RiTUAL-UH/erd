 As I recall it, they were driven out. 




 People have become untrustworthy so I don't blame you. I am very guarded as well. I also think this is the reason why people have resorted to having and overly affectionate towards pets. Like women with cats for example.
Still, money isn't s bad thing as long as it is used efficiently as a tool/means to achieve something of importance or value. 




 I haven't seen this comment so I'll just go ahead and ask: 
Isn't this exactly the blueprint used by most religion today? 




 Your 'relative' believed he was getting you into something that would make you as rich as he was going to be. So I wouldn't blame him, he was self deluded at that point. 




 IBM sent emails on Saturdays. #IJS 




 How is this any different from politics. Specifically, how is this any different from actual work. Isn't the average job just a better paid MLM? I mean, compared to the CEOs and those within his proximity, I'd say the average worker is not really making anything 




 I will never understand why we have concluded that money is the 'only' possible way to motivate human beings to work or do their best. 




 Very true. It's actually idolizing money, which goes against the 1st commandment. We are to place only The Highest above all else so that this shapes everything we pursue in life. It's actually for your own benefit so that you are not lost. And not because you have some 'jealous' God. 




 That was one loaded comment. But I bet you Walmart will have a prenuptial agreement. 




 'Two things you need to live without worry.' That right there is the problem. You can simply decide to live without worry. Work hard and be confident in the law of reciprocity. 
Also, money and power do not absolve you of worry. It often brings tenfold worry. Being at peace is more a psychic/inner state. 




 So I was thinking, cause you know, people do that from time to time, that you should make a conversation starter checklist too. Simply hand said list to the other party and have them check which ones they'd be happy to discuss.
Win-win, no? 




 Here is some data on nutrition from the USDA:

Folks should also consider not patronizing establishments that fuel mass consumption of anything (think mcdonalds, burger king, pizza hut etc). All these 'chains' have high demand and therefore high supply and little to no accountability.

When we act without thinking especially with habits and consumption, we all tend to follow trends and fads. This is bad in ever way. Especially with food. We subconsciously become comfortable with a very very limited variety when it comes to food. We often do not experiment and learn to develop a taste for a wider variety. This is why everyone eats pizza, burgers, beef and just a handful of other foods (oh and chicken).
There are millions of different types of food and millions more when you think of the number of different combinations. But we have become far to indolent and complacent in the way we live. So we can't always blame these corporations for the way they act because we basically created an environment for them to flourish.  









 Let's take a moment to note that beyond name calling and the sparring application of labels, you have offered absolutely nothing to the discussion here.
Animals 'fight' each other for territory, mates, food. All of these things are necessary for existence. Please tell me what your blood thirst for war is about? I think you are the one living in a very sad bubble. Deluding yourself that the madness in Syria etc are 'natural'. What a sad sad human being. 




 It is interesting. I'm 2 years younger than you are but you look much older. Most of these things that we do socially these days are literally poisoning our bodies but we consider them 'manly' and fun.
I'm glad you started to take care of yourself and I hope continue to do so. Its much more fun being in a healthy body I think.  




 I don't understand how this is going to help Greece. Can someone please ELI5: 
1. How does taking on more debt to make payments on debts you already have, but clearly are unable to afford, work?
Isn't this in fact just delaying the inevitable and making the devastation of the inevitable worse that it would be at the current time?
2. Aren't their new creditors the same creditors loaning them more money? Why don't they just get a interest free payment deferral?  









 Like everything, I feel that we focus too much on creating these one size box to fit an idea.
Why is it either communism, capitalism, socialism, etc? These concepts were created centuries ago. We have smartphones for crying out loud, I say we rid ourselves of these outdated ideas of a time we can't forget soon enough!
Why do we not create a mix by taking the observed positives from our own experiences and create something that works for us? And it does not and actually can not be the same blend for every single nation as we are all different. What is 'perfect' for the American should absolutely not be perfect for the German.
Why can we not create a society without abject poverty and suffering? Well, because such a society will naturally preclude the possibility of excesses and lavish luxury. That is the answer. They are both two sides of the same coin.
Want to end societal or world poverty, end societal or world excess! 




 But prosperity is not synonymous with wealth. Ask the Danish. 
Prosperity is not having excess and not suffering from want. It is also not lazily lounging about in comfort and neither is it about overwrought nerves resulting from excessive toil. It is a balanced middle middle class.

Edit: grammar. 




 Here is an excerpt from a book which addresses these and many many other questions:

http://grailmessage.com/en/volume-two/earthly-possessions

Wealth and earthly possessions are gifts which should be enjoyed by being put to good use. It becomes a problem and a hindrance for many when they allow their wealth or fortune to enslave them. That is, they instead subjugate their entire life to the pursuit of and acquisition of said wealth.  




 Why? Are we not 'higher' animals?
My point wasn't to kill and enslave each other. Animals do not do that.  If you look and read about the structure of animal society, you will hardly find killing and enslavement. You have predator prey relationships and this is a simple balancing act. There is no 'slavery' in nature, that is man's creation. 
There is also no war in nature, there is however warfare, which is completely different. 
I never said let them die in the gutter, my argument was in favor of what you are saying. In a sense, I said we should try and emulate a structure similar to the animals in that they do not have to 'buy' anything they need for basic survival. Building material, food, water, clothing, should be made available free to every member of society. 




 Human's live off logic? What type of logic comes up with the society we live in today? With all the suffering, starvation, deprivation, war and death. You 'claim' that we live off logic, but the evidence shows quite the opposite.
You call them 'wild' animals but really these animals live in a perfect harmony with their environment and each other. Even in the structure of predator and prey, you still have a perfectly logical and balanced system. 
You are right, we shouldn't compare humans to other animals, we have proven enough that we act lower than animals in the way we live and interact with one another. 




 How is a loan considered assistance? 




 We, my friends, are screwed! 




 Actually, yes. 




 Very good point. But if we take animals as an example, they do not have to work a job but they must put in some effort to find food and also to avoid becoming food. But they have free housing, and materials for every day life. How can we create a human equivalent? 




 Sure. There is precedent both from Exxon and other energy companies. Apply this to people. If tried and convicted of a crime, people are placed on parole. At that point, it suffices to just be implicated in, or be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is no burden of proof required since he/she has shown exactly what they are capable of.
Why are you acting all brand new as though Exxon and these other energy companies are any better than ex convicts? 




 Could this be a clue to understanding/solving warp travel? A controlled burst. Instantaneous infinitely large but short lived acceleration that warps you from point A to point B. So it appears you're almost in both places at once because of the duration of travel. 




 That doesn't mean they 'didn't' either. 




 At the end of the day, if you can be honest with yourself, this is really just looking at the opposite sex naked. In any other context this will be considered being perverted. Why does slapping the label of sport, art, or some other high sounding designation, make it any different than what it really is? 




 I'm not sure, I think the evidence had been conclusive for a while now. Like the article says, folks like Exxon have successfully funded the efforts to muddy the waters aka make it appear inconclusive. 




 Ya think? 




 This guy. Since when did politicians let logical reasoning get in the way of their ideology? 




 This sounds too logical and common-sensy. You must be communist! 




 This point is so sad. This country could be a much better place. We could really have stuck it you the Europeans. In a good way of course.... 




 And not one cheetos gif. Come on Reddit.. 




 You're putting way too much thought into this.
