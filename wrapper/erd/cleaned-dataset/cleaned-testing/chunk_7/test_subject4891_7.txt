you might want to know this 




 I'm trying to get my ptex from mudbox to maya, but the textures won't extract.

   I want to send to maya. Yet when I use the send to maya command, the textures are black. I need to fix the textures being black, or fix the map extract not working. 









 Any fixes? 









 Track of course! 




 It's a very different interface from v1. 









 Olay 









 No, I don't want an animated video texture like something on an iPhone screen, I have a maya obj sequence where a ship is flying and I've brought it into element. The only thing is, It won't allow me to box map the model in the animation. 




 Obj sequences. I figured out obj sequences. By the way, when you open an obj sequence, do you want to click and import the very first frame or the very last one? 









 Well how do I bring the textures into element?i don't see the materials showing up 




 I want the model WITH its textures on it. 




 Please answer both questions. 




 Explain please. 
























 Wheres  a good place to upgrade? I one time found a place selling cs6 upgrade for $150 




 Why would I need to do that?

 Please help. I'm so frustrated.
I have a 64 bit windows computer. I believe I have nvidia GTX video cards. I don't see why element 3d for after effects won't work? 









 I'm using a software designated for educational use, and I want to showcase my work and tutorials to students and my audience. 
 




 Where can I find the student terms of use? 




 Ok, on a side note, Im using student version. Can I use my animations in YouTube videos and allow YouTube to put ads in my videos. 




   What if I used ads? It's not commercial use. I'm not directly gaining money. 









 I need help with binding rigs to arms 









 Pardon my newfagness. I'm stressed. I'm working on a film and trying to import shit to Max and Maya and everywhere. Anyway, thanks. 




 Please help. Don't tell me to look up on google. give me a straight step by step guide right here. I'm on a time constraint. 




 Will it also import the rigs too?

 You should note that I had deleted the shortcuts then tried to redowlad maya

It says I've downloaded the software yet I can't find it anywhere on my computer  




 Is it that simple? I don't need any extra scripts or plugins?  









 Install now, download now, or browser download?

 What steps do I take? 




 Well o got it so I guess this thread is kill 




 I've tried install now and download now, both of which didn't work for some reason. So now I'm trying browser download. 




 Would I be able I use that for my youtube short films? Also, will I be able to get the software every year for free? Like do I need to confirm I'm a student? 




 B H = discounts galore
