 It wasn't a sweep... 




 I mean, excluding the fact that the Magic went 2-0 against the Lakers in the regular season, and were a (horrible, horrible) missed layup away from being 2-2 with the Lakers through 4 games. 




 66 win Cavs team with lebron putting up historically great playoff numbers = weak? 




 We're in the exact same asset-collecting stage as you, we don't want to give those up, and we're very high on Elfrid as our starting PG. 




 That's a little bit nuts. Bill Russell was unequivocally the greatest defender in NBA history, has 5 times as many MVP's as Hakeem, and was the undisputed best player on TEN championship teams (I would argue Havliceck was the best player during their '68 and '69 title runs). 




 Sure.  

For Moses - he has a couple factors working for him. He had incredible longevity in his career, he was an all-time great scoring center, and beyond that he was one of the greatest rebounders ever, and beyond that he was THE greatest offensive rebounding center ever; he led the NBA in offensive rebounding 8 times and had a 7 year stretch where he averaged over 6 offensive rebounds a game. I won't get into the statistics of it, but that level of offensive rebounding created an extraodinary offensive advantage for his teams purely by increasing their # of possessions. Very few players in NBA history have ever offered this kind of advantage.  
Secondly, he was the undisputed best player in the NBA from 1978-1983, unseating a late-prime Kareem, besting future teammate Dr. J, and preceding and delaying the Magic/Bird Rivalry as the best players in the NBA. It should be noted that during this time he won 3 MVP's, whereas Kobe only ever won 1 - and it's fair to point out that Kobe's era of MVP competition was much weaker than Malone's. This is probably one of Kobe's biggest knocks as well.   
Finally, Malone was the indisputable leader of the one team that managed to win a championship RIGHT in the middle of the Lakers/Celtics dynasty era of the 80's. He did so by SWEEPING the showtime lakers with Dr. J already in hard decline (he averaged 18/7/3 on 45% in the playoffs that year). I think MM has a very strong argument over Kobe.  

Second, Jerry West - West had the misfortune of playing for the Lakers in his prime against the greatest team dynasty ever assembled. Simply being on a team that MADE it to the finals 10 times in 13 years is an incredible accomplishment. Knowing he didn't ever win an MVP either makes this position a little dubious, but then knowing he was the MVP runner up 5 times makes it a little less dubious, considering his prime coincided with the Wilt/Russell/Oscar primes. West is also the NBA logo - which I deserves a couple points in my book for the sheer iconography :). Some actual numberical arguments for west: he leads kobe in career PPG, RPG, APG, and FG%. Obviously those comparisons don't hold a lot of water when adjusting for the pace of 60's games; but I'll offer two statistical counter-arguments. First, Wests game was severely hurt by the nonexistence of the three point line because West was an *incredible* shooter; in fact just looking at his FG% in the context of his era (FG% was pathetically low in the 60's) alongside arguments that we've all heard in critique of Kobe - I would say there's an argument to be made that West was a better shooter than Kobe was given the evolution of the game in their comparative careers. Second, west consistently averaged many more assists than Kobe in an era where assists were significantly harder to get credit for, which offsets to a good degree the increased # of possessions per game in the 60's.

I'll say finally that I think Kobe's career has been greatly greatly enhanced by factors outside of how good he was as a player. He was always going to be good enough to be the best player on a championship team, sure. But pairing up with prime Shaq and then having Pau-Odom-Bynum as your supporting cast when the East sent relatively weak teams both years, all while having the greatest coach in NBA history coaching your team, were strokes of absolutely incredible luck for him. He did lead his team to two championships, and he is a historically good shooter, and for that I think he definitely deserves a spot in the "God Tier" of NBA players along with about 15 other guys, but I think when you look at how truly good of a player he is I don't see him stacking up favorably purely from the circumstances of his career. When people talk about his drive and will to succeed and be the best, I think it's a great narrative and absolutely true - but ruthless competitiveness is a means and not an end. When we measure players we measure how good they were, not how they got there, so I'm not convinced that's a valid argument to move him up the pantheon.  




 I think the "potential" factor is pretty warranted though. He not have any attitude/mentality issues like cousins, or potentially limiting weaknesses he isn't already rapidly addressing like Kyrie *despite* being on a bad team.

 I'm almost with you here. I wouldn't put him behind KG though.

2. Kareem  
3. Magic  
4. Bird  
5. Lebron  
6. Wilt
7. Russell
8. Shaq
9. Duncan
10. Oscar
11. Moses Malone
12. Jerry West
13. Hakeem
14. Kobe
15. Karl Malone
16. Julius Irving

Edit: I'll happily defend any one of those players over Kobe. 




 Furthermore, the Magic pick must convey by 2019 and is set for 2 years after their pick is conveyed to Philly - meaning that the Lakers would have to finish in the top-5 in the next three consecutive lotteries for the Magic pick to become two consecutive 2nd rounders.

It absolutely will convey. 




 10 points for 35 minutes of playtime is hardly 'robust'.

 It never ends in a tie. 




 ... and then the game started 




 As someone who went to FSU during the Tebow era, I can safely say:  

No one cares, fuck the Gators. 




 Ha. Florida State beat you guys 31-10 and more than doubled your total yardage. You guys got pretty well dominated, and like it or not, it's going to leave a lasting impression in the eyes of the voters.  




 Heh, according to [this](http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning?page=single); I'm wrong about the calories issue.

But regardless, you *really* should cover less total distance and start actually running. 




 1) calories burned  is roughly equal to distance covered; there is a difference between running and walking but it's negligible. at 5 miles a day you're probably burning closer to 600 or 700 calories.

2) The only real and significant way to improve your ability to run is to run. I can promise you right now that if you ran an aggregate of 10-15 minutes, 4 times a week, you will not come even close to tiring yourself out. You are worlds away from overtraining my friend. Injuries *can* happen, but that's always going to be a risk, so don't fret it.

3) If your goal is to eventually run a 5k, you should stop covering so much distance every day, and start running. Developing your cardio and slow-twitch fiber muscles are your two most important objectives, and neither are going to helped much by walking.

4) If you have a side goal of losing weight, you should do it in the kitchen.  




 Request: Jameis Winston TD throw against Bethune Cookman. 




 Yep, there are a good handfull of financial/technical papers that keep a pretty low circulation but cost like $100-250 an issue. They'll probably never die. 




 I saw that, and it's super helpful! I always like to get several opinions though. 




 I'm about to start work in tax for a national non-big4 firm, I'm a bit nervous and obviously want to do well. Should I spend the next week brushing up on my excel skills? What do I need to keep in mind on the job? Things you wish you knew going in? Tell me everything you wish you could tell yourself when you first started. 




 I'm about to start a full-time job, and I need about 4 or 5 new dress shirts. I checked the sidebar for both button-ups and business casual. They are both full of good info, but neither suggest any brands or brand comparisons for button-up shirts. 

What are your major go-to brands for getting dress shirts? Preferably those who have online stores! 




 And Patrick Ewing 




 But to be more fair, he also averaged 48 minutes a game and 40fga per game that season, in an era where teams took on average 30-50% more fga per game than they do today. 




 It's weird to think that if brandon jennings was 2 months younger or had scored one more point he would be on this list. 




  but even then, he's above and beyond those two guys.

Stockton was all-nba first team twice, Nash was the league MVP twice.  
I think there's an argument for both of them, but to suggest it's not even that close is ridiculous. 




 Where did your double-doubles stat come from? [This](http://www.examiner.com/article/players-with-the-most-double-doubles-nba-history) says otherwise. 




 Roy Hibbert has never-

* Had a full NBA month where he averaged over 10 rebounds a game
* Scored 13ppg over the course of a season
* shot 50% over the course of a season
* Been much better at scoring than league average from really any area of the floor, per his [hoopdata](http://www.hoopdata.com/player.aspx?name=Roy%20Hibbert) 

And he's 26, only a year younger than Dwight Howard. I realize that last year he was playing injured for the first half of the season, but until he has at least a full season under his belt of seriously improved play, I think the aforementioned points cast some strong doubts about his potential to be the best big man in the league. 




 How about this then: Roy Hibbert has never played a full regular season month of NBA basketball in which he averaged 10 rebounds a game. 




 Tyson's Corner, you sweet mischievous devil. 




 I'm glad you put a ton of effort into this post, it's refreshing to see an opinion backed by supporting arguments but... I still completely disagree, If we're comparing pre-back injury Dwight to Marc Gasol, then Dwight is still easily the better center.  
    
You acknowledged that Dwight was significantly better at rebounding, but you seem to disregard to some degree just how much that matters for how good they are as overall players. Look, for instance, at [this graph](http://skepticalsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Top1000_11343_image001.png) showing how Dwight compares to some of the all time rebounding greats. Being such a tremendous vacuum for defensive rebounding is an *incredible* advantage that Dwight offers that Marc doesn't even meet league-par for (Marc Gasol was 84th last year in defensive rebounding rate, with Zach Randolph 20th).

Even outside of rebounding, I think your on/off the court defensive rating is specious because you're comparing two completely different teams with completely different rotations. Nobody since prime Ben Wallace (who was on par or ahead of Magic-Dwight) has even come close to being the shot-altering, game-plan changing, one-man wrecking crew Dwight was from 2009 to 2012.

On offense- I think you're spot on about Marc's versatility being an advantage, but I think your "floor spacing is everything" argument doesn't hold water. The Rockets are in theory (as the Magic were in practice) aren't going to be held back in any regard by having only one true big on the floor, their emphasis on three point shooting comports with that limitation perfectly.  
Finally, unless I missed it, you completely omitted the impact Howard had as the head-and-shoulders-above-the-league best pick-and-roll center in the NBA offensively. Howard's athleticism on getting to the basket was the single biggest reason (among many others) the magic had the 2nd best offensive efficiency in the league in 2010. 




 Because that's 5 extra years of schooling and anywhere from 200k-450k of student loans. 




 Really, he's just mad we're not catering to 1946. 




 TBD about MKG; he isn't 20 yet, so it's not fair to entirely judge, but he hasn't shown anything between last season and summer league that he was supposed to have coming into the league.  




 AbeeEEeeEEeeeEEEeeed 




 Nah, Walton's prime was comparable to maybe any center in league history, including shaq's; it was just so absurdly short and he didn't use it to win a ring - and so it's been forgotten with time.   




 In re. point 3: Let's not forget that taxing the entire value of the transaction as opposed to the recognizable income on the transaction is almost an offensively stupid idea to anyone who understands how our tax code works (i.e. not r/politics) and would never make it into actual law; though even if it did it would get quickly struck down.  




 .5% 




 To be fair, Jameer didn't help them get to the finals. He was injured. Dwight did work with a backcourt of Courtney Lee (as a rookie), a much lesser developed JJ Redick, and Rafer Alston.  




 Right now I have it at:  
1. Thunder  
2. Rockets  
3. Clippers  
4. Spurs  
5. Warriors  
6. Nuggets  
7. Grizzlies  
8. T-Wolves/Pelicans (total crapshoot depending on injuries and fit) 




 Anyone 6'6 or higher is going to give him trouble, but there are plenty of SG's in the league of comparable height that he can (and usually does) defend just fine. 




 What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 




 SVG said that Dwight was the mot coachable player he's ever coached, and if he had the chance he would do it again in a heartbeat.  




 Yep. Nash winning in '05 was one of the greatest travesties in NBA MVP history. *Anyone* who would argue he deserved it over the four great bigs (Shaq, Duncan, Nowitzki, Garnett) of 05 is insane. 

 




 A  C  F 




 A team in a garbage position is not the same thing as a garbage team. 




 To be fair- that was largely a product of his low usage rate. He was drafted into a team with four good scoring options in place already, and was asked to play a limited role.  




 false. 




 Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, and Ryan Anderson give them four *solid* scoring options. With Vasquez' passing ability off the bench, they're a good role player signing or two away from being a ~45 win fringe WC playoff team. 

If they don't trade any of the aforementioned 5 for the next two years they're all on contract, all of their players are in their young-to-mid 20's and will likely keep developing from here. I could see them getting up around 50 wins in 2014/2015 with the nucleus they have now. 




 Yeah! Tobias Harris averaged17/8.5/1.5blk at 20 years old, and Vucevic went 13/12 in his 2nd year in the league. Throw in Moe Harkless who is a very solid perimeter defender in the making, Nicholson with a polished offensive game, and Oladipo in the mix; we have a pretty sweet core going forward. 




 Block party in New Orleans.

Love it. 




 Anthony Davis was pretty solid offensively this past year. 




 I like Nicholson :(

But yeah, I totally agree. 




 Also- we're a bit crowded as well. Nicholson had a very nice rookie year at PF; and Tobias Harris will also probably spend most of the time there with Moe Harkless looking like a staple of our future core. We really don't have the minutes to spare unless we want to take them from Nicholson, which IMO would be a terrible idea considering how offensively refined he is already.  




 Yes.  

Oh... fans?  

No.  









 Also:  
Kemba Walker  
Ty Lawson  
Tyreke Evans (if that's really his position)  
Jrue Holiday  
Eric Bledsoe  
Damian Lillard  
Brandon Jennings  
Ricky Rubio  
Steve Nash  
Goran Dragic  
Jarett Jack  
and Greivis Vasquez

Chalmers is really nowhere close to the top-10.
 




 Meh, they also signed Carlos Boozer who, despite underperforming, still made them much better.   
They also signed Thibs as their coach in place of Vinny Del Negro- which meant going from having the worst coach in the league to one of the three best.  
They also signed Kyle Korver, and got Taj Gibson- both were integral role players to the team's success in 2011.

So it's not nearly as simple as you're making it out to be.  




 Okay 




 That doesn't make any sense. 




 OLIDAPOOOOOOOO 




 This is great! I have a solid understanding of reformed theology, heidegger, and Calvin; but not so much modern theology or Schleiermacher, but I will definitely look into those subjects as I plan my attack for this treatise. 

I mentioned in another post that I'll probably be going through the [study edition](http://www.amazon.com/Church-Dogmatics-Vol-1-1-Sections/dp/0567202909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1371540976 sr=8-2 keywords=karl+barth+church+dogmatics) because I don't think I have the theological (or multi-lingual) background to get a good understanding of this treatise when read straight-on.  




 This insight is wonderful and incredible cool. Thank you for writing it. 




 I haven't read any Barth before. How valuable would you say having read something by him before is, as opposed to diving straight in? And what other work would you recommend? 




 Because the [Study Editions](http://www.amazon.com/Church-Dogmatics-Vol-1-1-Sections/dp/0567202909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1371540976 sr=8-2 keywords=karl+barth+church+dogmatics) offer a much more palatable way of reading through Barth's work. From what I've heard this treatise is dense enough that I'd like to take the path of least resistance to minimize any discouragement.  




 I'm heavily contemplating doing a multi-year read through this work, and am equally excited and daunted by the idea of its length and expense (the study books I'm ordering are about 10,000 pages in length and $1,000 total).

Has anyone here ever worked through all or a part of this work, and would they have any insight or recommendations about it? 




 Brofist*

My AE walnut captoe oxfords are maybe the coolest things I've ever owned.

 I am not a smart man...  

I just manually created the location, and then moved everything over, and now it works fine. Thank you so much! 




 Thank you so much! I've made an edit- I think now I'm having trouble getting cmd to recognize my path? I added a path in 'environment variables' on my control panel C:\jdk1.7.0_21\bin; but when I go to cmd and enter cd C:\jdk1.7.0_21 it says "the system cannot find the path specified. I'm not sure what that means.

And, I really appreciate the encouragement. 




 This is my first time learning any programming language ever, so this is a very very beginner question. I'm using a textbook that has told me to do a couple of things I already can't figure in getting started. I'm using windows 8.

After installing JDK and adding the path, my book says to install the Library Source and Documentation by: opening a shell window, change to the jdk directory  
make a subdirectory *src*:  
mkdir src  
cd src


I don't know how to change a directory on cmd, or how to make a subdirectory. I have no clue what I am doing and it's already incredibly frustrating.

**Edit**: After having searched around for an hour, I can change the directory using cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_21, but then I'm getting access denied when I try and set up a subdirectory.  
I've put in a path in environment variables as C:\jdk1.7.0\bin, but that path is not being recognized by cmd? Somebody please help? 




 Fellow JD here, just graduated. So far from what I can tell, it's been more difficult to find a job simply because law schools largely don't have any connections or contacts with CPA firms.  




 Eh. Dwight was quite clearly the best center in the league for at least a four year stretch, and he spent most of this season recuperating from back surgery. Tim Duncan is a power forward. Roy Hibbert is dominating a team right now that doesn't even use real centers; remember he averaged 11.8/8.3 on 45% shooting this year. Marc can do everything well as a center, which makes him amazingly valuable, but the handful of things Dwight does (or rather, did preceding this season,) he does miles better than Marc Gasol.

Let's not get too carried away with short term memory. 




 There was an interview posted here a while back where Nabokov said that he was not in any way influenced by Joyce and only read one novel, Ulysses, by him until much later in life. But you're spot on about Poe.

 *The best center in the NBA, when healthy 




 He actually did an amazing job of containing Dwight when the Hawks beat the Magic two years ago in the first round. He's very good at defensive rotations and in several other ways that don't reflect on the stat sheet.  




 I don't mean to sound rude, but implicit possession is like literally the first thing you learn in an informal logic class. They really, truly, are not different at all. 




 No. Stating something is "ridiculous" is, by nature, a matter of opinion. So the "I think" is implicit when you say "it is ridiculous" because we now know that's what you're thinking. They are the same statement. 




 Those two things are literally exactly the same.  




 I've always loved the intensity of Job 38:

Where were you when I laid the earths foundation?  
    Tell me, if you understand.  
Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!  
    Who stretched a measuring line across it?  
On what were its footings set,  
    or who laid its cornerstone  
while the morning stars sang together  
    and all the angels shouted for joy?"

Do any verses draw a deep, solemn inspiration the same way for you? 




 If not for him taking his Rhodes scholarship he probably would have been somewhere 3rd-4th round pick; I think things could have worked for him in either direction but he kinda made his bed by taking that year in Oxford. 

Either way, he's an outstanding individual and I'm only happy for him 




 I've always had a question: should an upvote/downvote/nonvote distinction be made on a completely value-neutral basis? Or should the actual quality of the substance of the post have some influence in a normative redditor-downvote/upvote decision?  
e.g. If someone puts a lot of thought into an opinion, we should not be downvoting them regardless of what that opinion is; but if their justifications are so weak and exegetically wrong, and their deductive reasoning so horrifically bad, that it arguably *doesn't* even add to the conversation, could that merit a downvote in spite of the effort put into the post? 




 That's nothing like saying the Bulls are just as good without derrick rose; look at their respective records when the pg's are playing and when they're out. 

I've been consistently saying that Rondo is not near the elite point guard everyone in /r/nba thinks he is. The guy definitely has a way of sometimes completely taking over a game... but if he's never going to use it in the regular season, and can only get there 15% of the time in the playoffs, then how much can you really ascribe that characteristic to him as a player? 




 Sorry forgot to mention that this list wasn't exhaustive- it only includes the ~30 highest career points leaders in NBA history. 




 Lebron and Kobe both completed their 8th 2000 point season recently. Durant is the only other player to do so this season, however Melo and Harden might join them before the season ends.   
First of all, I realize that 2000 is an arbitrary number, and this stat isn't too indicative of anything we didn't already know. But it's still interesting to look back and see it as a rough metric for consistency in a player's career: how many times a player averaged 25 points a game for 80 games a season (or a rough equivalent).   That is to say- it could be a rough look at a combination of how long a player was able to score at a high level without injury.   
Of course things like the lockout, game pace, the 3pt line and the evolution of defenses hurt various players through various periods, so I don't think this is dispositive of anything, just an interesting stat to look at. 

Here's an all-time list:

Karl Malone- 12  
MJ- 11 (was 29 when he got his 8th)  
Kareem Abdul jabbar- 9   
Kobe- 8  
Lebron- 8  
Dominique Wilkins- 8  
Alex English- 8  
Wilt- 7 (including a 4000 point season)  
Oscar Robertson- 7    
Dirk- 5  
Allen Iverson- 5 (and a 1989)  
Jerry West- 5  
Larry Bird- 4  
Shaq- 4  
Elvin Hayes- 4  
David Robinson- 4  
Hakeem- 4 (and a 1995 season)  
Moses Malone- 4  
Vince Carter- 3  
Kevin Durant 3  
Patrick Ewing- 2  
John Havlicek- 2  
Tim Duncan- 1  
Reggie Miller- 1  
KG never had one  
Ray Allen never had one  

Edit: I should probably point out that this isn't an exhaustive list of everyone whose ever had one. But everyone who is currently ahead of LBJ in all-time points is included on this list.  




 Honestly, if in 3 months Lebron has a 4th MVP (very likely), another ring (reasonably likely), and another finals MVP (almost guaranteed assuming they win); I'd take his lifetime body of work over Kobe's. 

Those are big ifs though.  




 1. People knock on it all the time. It would be, by far, the lowest fg% of any player in most all-time top-10 lists, with the exception of Bill Russell whose offense makes up 0% of his basketball legacy.  
2. Dwyane Wade, Michael Jordan (emphasis here), Magic Johnson, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Julius Erving, Steve Nash, Walt Frazier; and even in the present day Chris Paul, Tony Parker, and Stephen Curry all have much better FG% and TS% than Kobe  
3. Taking into consideration the number of terrible shots he's taken should rightfully work against his legacy, it shouldn't be a factor we control for when defining it.

 You are awesome. Thanks. 




 Yes, this is it. Thanks! Would you be able to recommend any better analogies? It's a lot easier to communicate conceptually with them. 




 I saw in /r/Christianity a little while back an infographic explaining the trinity. It had a list of good and bad analogies and why they were good and bad. I've spent a while searching through this sub for it but I can't seem to find it anywhere; would anyone happen to know what I'm talking about or have the picture saved somewhere? 




 Dammit, I loved that record.  




 Welcome to /r/nba; where the subscribers are mostly white and the jokes are even whiter 




 Any Magic fan who is okay with us letting go of Vucevic is an idiot. I've also not encountered one among the dozen Magic bros I chat with. 




 No, sorry, I'm a CPA; so generally in an unrelated field.  




 With Thompson, Kyrie, and Waiters- you're one more good draft pick away from having tons of potential; and then one Lebron james signing away from being a real contender. 




 Okay :( 




 No dude, you gotta just understand that PLaSMaN knows your God is imaginary /s 









 You could say the idea of downvoting us is *irresistible*.
