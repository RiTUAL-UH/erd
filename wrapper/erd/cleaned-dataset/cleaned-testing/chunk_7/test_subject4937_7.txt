 Very, very doubtful but instead of slicing it, take it to a local university for analysis before damaging it.  




 I agree, but very little has that same structure, color and texture. I have worked extensively with schorl and can absolutely tell by looking.  




 That was my first thought--like wow, this is not only clever but this person clearly did some research.  




 Without a doubt 









 Layers and layers and layers... 




 Looks a bit like half of a rare bagelosaurus. 




 Yes, had some Dremel burns before.. Very helpful and even more incentive to invest in a new toy. Looks like he got a heck of a deal though. Can't find anything quality in that $300 frame 




 Dumb question but how safe are they? Seems it would be easy to let your hand slip on a wet rock and...well...you know. 




 Even more inspiration for this investment--thanks so much for posting. Great jaspers too-- 









 It is not a tentical, or even a tentacle as those types of soft tissues do not fossilize. 




 I would let it sit in a weak oxalic acid bath for about four or five days then sit down with a dental pick to expose the crystals. Acid sounds dangerous but it works great and really lets these shine.  














 Since they all chimed in with the right answer, let me propose a wrong one. It's petrified Chex mix. 




 Yes please! I love handiwork like this, thanks for considering! 




 That is the most awesome answer I could have ever expected. What a great craft--can you post something that you've made and the resultant slag? 




 If you don't mind my asking, what does one with a bog ore collection? Or is it just a special collection item? 




 NC rockhounder here--yes, that's common stuff; pretty up close. I believe it's olivine, but where you found it epidote is not uncommon either. I can almost guess where you found it, by the way, because I've only ever seen it great quantities in this one location. About an hour from Greensboro. 




 Found or bought?  














 Thanks, but the red crystals don't have the characteristic shape under magnification. They're just clusters.  




 Here are two more photos using my LED maginfier - http://imgur.com/a/8Mksu 




 This is quite heavy for its appearance--not sure what any of it is, most curious if that's ruby since it's been found near where I was (other corundum as well)--not sure what the black is or the white either. How would I carefully expose the red/ruby/garnet, whatever it is? So appreciative of this resource--learn a lot, but confused myself on this one. 









 The story has been updated with biographical sketch of this guy. From starting college at 12, running a very conservative senate campaign, run ins with pornographic legal problems and now exascale computing, less convinced than ever before. Update is now listed on same page. 




 I don't know but all I can think when I see this rock is that it looks delicious. 









 What was strange to me that when she asked why keep it all centrally located when risk would be centralized too (since he's planning to use it for currency trading) he said BECAUSE of Linpack. That was his only reason. She was just silent a minute like "ummm" ....then it got stranger. I don't know if she just had him on for the sake of amusement (all of the Wire podcasts are with reputable people this is an anomaly) or what but I am mystified by almost everything he said. He doesn't sound like someone who understands a single thing about HPC. 




 Crinoid stem in good shape, looks to me. 




 By the end of this she's quite skeptical too...interesting stuff. But no proof, which is what she's digging for. NDA with Intel, no deeds to be found on that land in Oregon, but the guy's company for currency trading might (MIGHT) make some sense. However, delivering it through cloud--not big sense. 









 Meanwhile, this is will (sadly) be one of the most popular articles about supercomputing. *sigh 









 Very Game of Thrones. And of course, very awesome.  














 YOUR government, I meant. Was so struck by the utter shamelessness of this "contest" that I forgot how to spell.  














 Heh. Fair enough. 





























 There's always good old fashioned tape if you want a tangible artifact. 
























 It's Bismuth, doesn't "come" that way in nature, it's been treated (heated and cooled) to form that characteristic pattern. Can be brittle, nice start to a collection if you're a beginner 




 Idiocracy is real.  




 And here are the predator types. Gender discrimination in the first lines (we want a man--you could be like these men) and unpaid tough job. http://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/11584121?trk=nmp_rj_job goback=.nmp_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1

I feel so bad for these kids.

11 applicants already. So upsetting.
