 Thanks, you too.  




 I keep getting comments like this, but I really don't know how to answer. I mean...can you imagine my own confusion? 




 Yes, we had played it, plus the left-overs and coffee were still out. That's how I know it wasn't a dream, and that I hadn't just woken up in bed and found her. 

I just got back from a three week long trip with my brother where we stayed with my aunt and uncle. I've been surrounded by nothing but friends and family, which definitely helps. 
 




 Thanks yaar.  




 I know I was conscious. The mugs and plates were still out from the coffee and left-overs we had.
