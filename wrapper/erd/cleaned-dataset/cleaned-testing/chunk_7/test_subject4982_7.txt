 To work my ass off to go back to school and not have to pay student loans.... 




 I remember switching from private to public schools...private schools everyone had brand-new art supplies. Crayons, makers, pencils, pens... This one kid in particular came from a very under privileged family.. I noticed his crayons one day, seeing that they were old and had been used a while ago. I took the money out of my piggy-bank and bought him a new pack. At the age of 7. To this day I will never forget the smile on his face when he found/opened up that new box of crayons that randomly appeared in his desk. 

 




 Something Corporate 




 God Bless the World, this is why I drive a Ford. Such amazing people. Love from Ohio my dear Redditor! 




 I'm from the Midwest, where pop is a soda and ranch is out on everything.  




 Gotta love Frank Zappa 




 Most of us women at the age of 12. If I can recall one girl named Meredith- she had called me a cow and said I was possessed by the devil. So I threw a chalk board eraser at her head. We went to catholic schools. She got a sucker for the pain, I got scolded, detention and 4 wonderful weeks of counseling by our parish sisters.  




 I think I have enjoy the concept of the show. The retired PI and the psychic/medium. Goodness, hopes down. But it's all good!  




 What gets me about her sketches is that when there are creatures or other entities the way she describes them and the sketches totally freak me out. The one that I will never forget, this image has stuck with me for moths was of the creature that she claimed to be an evil spirit in someone's hallway. It was a black mass with a round shaped mouth. It looked like it would suck the life out of you. I've seen something similar before and it just really struck me as real.  




 Does anyone on here watch Dead Files? If so how do you feel about Amy Alan? Being somewhat sensitive myself I feel as if she is the realest.  




 I wanna kick this ladies ass. For real. Being a girl and playing street hockey as a kid not ONE adult complained. They were so happy we were playing streey hockey and not doing drugs like the other. Bitter bitch. She needs to grow the fuck up. If it is that big of a deal talk go the parents not 12,year old kids. Fucking moron.  




 I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest. 


I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me. 

Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.  




 Upvote because it is disturbing that I'm intrigued and he is so young. 

Shame on me. 




 Just for a day! Or weekend.  




 ROLLING ROCK! My favorite. Touring the brewery this summer.  




 Come work at the Sylvania/Toledo Waffle House please.  




 He's awesome!

 I'm only 22 years young, and nothing makes me feel old until my 9yo sister tells me my boobs are saggy.

Edit: they are immaculate 44DDD 




 I agree with this whole 100%. My boyfriend is an AMAZING guy. He knows absolutely every way to please me, mentally, physically, emotionally. He's not as big as some of the other men I have dated prior to him but that doesn't bother me at all. He's so wonderful and good with everything else it truly isn't something I think about.  




 Just keep swimming !! 




 Face looks like he's got a dildo shoved up his ass hole 




 Human eyes. 




 Idk maybe like 5-6 large ones and a couple handfuls of small ones. Steven Tyler is my spirit animal.  









 LOL WHAT THE FUCK.







I'd lose it.
