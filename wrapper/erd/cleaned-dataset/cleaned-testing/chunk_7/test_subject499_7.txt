 Moderately. I'm not working at the moment and I'm spending all my time writing, which is what I love. That could change at any moment. 




 Pretty sound advice. 




 Tell me your secrets to ultimate happiness! 




 A black market, hey...?
Hmm... 




 Man, I'm just not a big music person. I tend to not buy music and just listen to the odd soung on Youtube. This feels like such a good time to get into his music though. 




 Anything that isn't a text book or a diary. Something...designed to be written in.

Fiction, and non-fiction and poetry books. Really anything that's must to be consumed, should stay in a good state. 

I know people really don't agree with this. But I hate the idea of defacing one of my books. I don't even dog-ear them. 




 I'm so jealous that you've seen him. He is the kind of guy you just know straight off is fucking amazing to see live.

I'm kinda new to his stuff so I'm just going through the new stuff at the moment. But I see you have provided links I will make the most =]

 Then you can be the judge of mine then :)

Now *that's* pressure! 




 *Backs away slowly*

Just kidding. I will do. It's a booktube thing, don't know if that sounds interesting. But if you're still interested =] 




 Thanks :)

Well I'm planning on uploading it tomorrow...if I can bring myself to do it. 




 Unsure on the rules. Does that count as self-promotion? Is such a thing allowed?

I mean, obviously the point is to start a conversation, but... 




 Oh this thread hurt me bad.

Talking about Harry Potter events - and not talking about the books.

Oh, calling it *The Sorcers Stone*. That just makes me feel icky.  




 My heart stopped a little bit then.

Write in one of my books. The idea strikes me as sacrilege.  




 Didn't what a playstation but knew how to run a simulator on a PC.

When I had my first PC it was still on dial-up. We used to have a farm game that played the song "B-I-N-G-O". If you know/remember that song. 

I was so happy when I got a playstation. 




 Yes. It was *'The Way of Shadows'* by Brent Weeks. It was two-for-one so I got the sequel as well.

Now my favourite genre to read and to write is fantasy. It's had quite a big effect on me. 




 You, m'lady, are a saint of the highest order :)

 Well the opinion bleeds over into the film. So I guess by putting it in this sub it is preemptive. 

If this film bombs (or she does do what she does in the books) and everyone hates it, I want people to come back to this thread. 




 Yeah, the entire scheme is flawed as fuck. Very much to the point of it being nonsensical. 

I like this idea that they're trying to paint the government as being all-powerful and totally evil. When...no...not really. The only bad thing is the Hunger Games - which is apparently the only governmental thing the actual government do.  




 That was a call for an example, actually.

 




 I'm mad about the scene in the book. 

The thing is, that is the *worst* trilogy I've ever read. And I've read Twilight. The Hunger Games is a good book. Catching Fire and Mockingjay are both totally, absolutely abysmal. So some of that hatred bleeds over into the films. 

I'm not mad at the films. Catching Fire was a good film. I'm against splitting the third book in two because *it's absolutely fucking awful, and* nothing *happens*. So the third film wasn't the best. But I'm waiting to see what they do with the third one. They've maintained a fair level with the films so I think it's only fair of me to expect the finale to be not totally awful. 




 The only thing you will regret is not having bought it sooner.
 




 I've never come across anything that would show me otherwise.  




 Never played that one. Though I hear good things.  




 I'm pretty happy with as it is, thanks. I trust that your changes will finalise it now :)  




 Titanfall had giant robots. COD might be doing better than it, but that's purely because the game already has a solid fanbase. Possibly (assuming here) made of pre-teens who don't really know a lot else about gaming so they stick to it. 

Team Fortress 2. That's a solid example of an FPS done right. I also quite liked Evolve. I know that isn't *quite* the same. But running around and hunting a giant monster is far better than running around and hoping you can start shooting someone before they start shooting you. 




 What conclusions have I arrived at? What misconceptions?

 




 [Thoughts?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA) 




 AW is a touch better but is still at it's core: run around firing your gun. And...AW shifted the format a bit and they added verticality. But they were too late to the verticality game because Titanfall was all over that. So at it's core it's still COD just with a pinch of Titanfall, and a smidgen of the power-ups from Halo 3. Which...isn't enough. 




 If it helps you can find size templates online :/ 




 If meat (red and white) forms a dietary staple, then...yeah. Need it to be kinda healthy. And sure you can replace it with pills, but those won't carry you through the same way.

It's not a matter of cooking. Well I should include pasta. I'll let you have that. I'm just not fond of veggies. 

I'm pretty sure that ethics is by its very definition without facts. Ethics and morals mean something entirely different for two different people. I mean, anything can aim to make a claim factual, that doesn't make it a genuine fact. I would on principle disagree with anyone or anything who tried to convince me I had to bend my beliefs to suit what they have decided. 

Are you implying we should be spoon fed our morals and ethical beliefs? Sure, some of what we take is given to us by our societies and we take that, we don't have a choice with that. Everything else we're pretty much left to decide for ourselves. 




 What do you think? [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA) 




 *Now?* Try four versions ago. 




 I mean, isn't meat pretty healthy. Not in vast quantities, and not processed. But aren't they dietary staples? Also, meat is the only thing that even tastes half decent.

Quantum physics(well, any science) /= ethics. My own opinions and ethics and morals I'm quite happy to decide by myself. And, just as a result of life, those things will change for me, that's just what happens. People I meet might change them, opinions are meant to be flexible. But at least I'm not being spoon fed everything I ought to decide by myself.

 




 That uploaded beautifully :).

Would it be possible to make adjustments? If you don't want to I'm perfectly happy with it as it is, 'cause it's great, just a few things don't look entirely right.

Feel free to tell me to piss off :) 




 Torturing something and eating something are totally different things. One is unnecessary, the other sustains life. That's all the food chain is. We don't torture the animals when we kill them - is that what you're getting at? 

I think contemplating issues in our own intellectual vacuum is probably healthier than being spoon-fed morals.

:) 




 Might might not make right. But thousands of years of evolution to shove us at the top of the food chain kinda mebbi does. 

Do I need an entire ethics committee to tell me what is wrong and right now? 

Sorry, I think you're going to read that and it comes off a bit harsh, that's not how it was intended. 




 The thing about splitting movies into two started with *The Deathly Hallows*. Which by all rights was a super long book and could have done with being split into two.

Mockingjay is a terrible book and nothing happens and doesn't need splitting into two. I disagree with it.  




 I'm glad I saved you the pain.

Well actually. Catching Fire is a horrendous book but a fairly good movie. The films are actually better than the books, so hopefully the final final one won't be that bad. 




 Well, when the third one comes out. It will have spoilt the whole movie for me then. 




 I don't have any controversial, but I do have *The Host, by Stephanie Meyer*. That would certainly get questioned. 




 Hey, thanks for this I really like it :). Unfortunately YT is saying the file is too big, I've tried fixing it but it hasn't worked. I'm unsure what the problem is.  




 Spiderman 2. Or the original Spiderman game on PS1. Both of these games were boss. They can't be beaten.  




 Why would someone call a swat team on a person, just because they got their arse kicked over a video game! 




 DA:I, yeah, was a colossal disappointment.

Don't worry, Withcer 3 is nothing like it.

The feel of Skyrim and TW3 are nothing alike. TW3 is much heavier, much more demanding. Both storywise and gameplay wise. But the worlds are equivalently epic and comparable. 

Just yeah...Get The Witcher 3. If you like high fantasy, especially TES, you'll love this. Also, you should play TW2, not to play TW3, just because it too is an awesome game. 




 Didn't check out the blog, but...Are you writing fanfiction? 




 I know. But that's my point. You can't say you love animals, but then only mean the cute ones. 




 That's heavy man. Real shit. I'm sorry you got stuck in such a bad situation. But the advice everyone has given you is the best. Leave her. I know it's hard, but it's that simple. 




 We are humans. We fucking earned our place to be able to eat meat. Don't feel guilty for it, it's extremely normal. 

The hypocritical thing to do would be to say you love all creatures, and then include the bi-line^aslongasthey'recute. Which is what most everyone does. "I love all creatures. (except Angler Fish, fuck those things)."

Nothing wrong with eating meat. And in fact nothing wrong with being a vegetarian. Just be comfortable with your choices. 




 I was raised a catholic, attended wholly catholic schools, and was confirmed into the religion as a teenager.

I don't believe in God. 

I don't think that God is important as a figure that *exists*. But just as something to put your faith in. To give the feeling of something bigger than yourself, that exists outside of you. It's a comfort. And, even as an atheist, I think churches, mostly, are great things - when done right. Their the only real figure that promotes peace, love and charity on any scale, I think, societally, that's important.

I'm an existentialist, I prefer to think I'm guiding my own life. 




 **MAD END OF HUNGER GAMES SPOILERS**

[Spoilers](#s "Not so much in the film (though I expect the upcoming film will replicate it) but in the book. They take over the capital *and she chooses to place the capital kids into a last hunger games.* Why? Fucking spite. Despite her sheer PTSD, her loathing of the capital borne *purely from* the hunger games. *nope, fuck it, into the Hunger Games you go you little innocent shits.* And, let's face it, that entire book is fucking terrible anyway.") 




 Ah I've come across Codecademy before. I could never stick to anything, so well done for doing it. I know coding isn't easy, so that's certainly something to pat yourself on the back for doing. By which I mean go out and celebrate!

 I'm not inherently against pre-orders, so this seems like a good idea. It's a bit of a gimmick though, convincing more people to pre-order because *you might the be one pre-order who pushes the group to the next bonus*. It's heavy sales tactics and manipulation which I'm against. 




 NIGHTCRAWLER NIGHTCRAWLER

Because they set up the romance with beast, rather than Azazel so... 




 It would be for me haha. I rarely exercise. And not if it can be otherwise avoided. 




 That is true. A day can't go wrong when it's headed by a decent sandwich :) 




 I think I'd have died about four days ago if I was considering even doing that. 




 I came across something which is a great way of measuring classics. Which is to compare it to the things that were out when it was published. The Catcher in the Rye was the first of it's kind, and whilst I don't think it's aged well, it certainly is/was deserving of it's classic status.

But you've actually hit on the reasons why the book is a good one. 

 he spends the entire book whining about how his life and choices are all some one else's problem.

Because he doesn't want to face responsibility. He doesn't want be an adult, as he says; a phony.  He isn't, as a character, meant to have a redeeming feature. That is his character. And yeah, nowadays, it's not very interesting, but *that is his character.* He's stuck in a loop. Stuck between being a teen, and being an adult, that's why he wants to be *The Catcher in the Rye*. 

John Green explains it better. If you want to get anything out of the book, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66eQLLOins) 




 You just know it's just bound to be a good day then.  




 Glad to hear it's a nice day. Have fun on your killer bike ride :) 




 I'm waiting for a phone call about whether or not I get to write the screenplay for a short film. *fingers crossed*. 




 That sounds like a pretty decent day! I can't see Ted 2 till the 7th :( 




 My day is pretty good. Best of all I'm waiting for a phone call from a guy who hopefully wants to hire me as a scriptwriter on his short story project. I want that job! 




 Try Smite. 




 try /r/suggestmeabook 




 Hey everyone, how's everyone's day going? Great, I hope =D 




 Yeah, it's not an easy read at parts. Probably not something I'd come back to either. But it's worth reading, just the once, I reckon. 




 I have a lot of favourite quotes. But the one I have tattooed on me, which is absolutely one of my favourites is *"So it goes."* by Kurt Vonnegut, from Slaghterhouse-5.

I just think that it's a fantastic principle to believe in. 




 Purists who've read every single comic book will never be happy with the film. 

People who dislike superhero films, and just pass them off as CGI-laden utter shit, will downvote them.

People who want to be hipster and dislike anything mainstream - yes, this actually happens - will downvote it.

It takes a certain kind of anything to be liked totally by the masses. Not even Harry Potter had the luxury of ensnaring *everybody*.  




 I've never had any issues with it. Does the job for me. My university lecturers said to get Final Draft as well, which, when a free version does the exact same job, to the exact same level, is ridiculous, and probably a touch elitist. These are the same people who also said to use FCPX over FCP7.

Yes, I use FCP as well, not Avid. I'll let you have that one. Avid really is the industry standard. 




 As a film, I think the idea is great. The execution of the first movie though was horrendous. We have a whole *city* full of *thousands/millions of people* who can do *literally anything*. 

But no, fuck that, here's the inside of a very boring house for two hours whilst the interesting things - *which clearly are not going to happen inside the house* - are occurring outside.  




 Happy I could help :) 




 Celtx does the job. Does it the exact same. Minus that needless fair chunk of change. 




 Get Celtx, it's free. It does the formatting for you. There will be tutorials online about where to put the formatting. How to introduce scenes and transitions.

Also, check out some professional, hollywood screenplays. Some are quite easy to find as PDF's via a google search. Always best to have a look at one, and gain an understanding that way before you sink your teeth in. 




 It ain't worth shit until we can play in it. And, lets face it, we can't. Those are pretty pictures. But they aren't game worlds. 




 I watched the movie yesterday. Hadn't seen it in a number of years. Damn, it is a really good movie! 




 Some of them are good, and some of them are just hella bland. I was watching a new one the other day and I was giggling madly.

Favourite character...eh....Why not Ralph? *"My cat's breath smells like cat food".

Yours? 




 What episode of the simpsons? Old episodes of the Simpsons *especially* the original Treehouse of Horror episodes are, hands down, the shit. 




 You can get a sample of the first few chapters on Amazon. I recommend reading through them. I did, I loved it, was amazing. 




 This is old, but also very good :) 




 New to the sub so not sure if this is within the rules, or what normally happens, but...can I request an entirely new cover art? I don't have anything to build it on, so it would have to be from scratch. You would of course be credited.

The channel is called: British Book Guy

Im British and it's a booktube channel. :)

Really it only needs to be simple, just the name in front of something british like the Union Jack or St. Georges Cross, with a cup of tea or something. Like I said, full creative control.

The recommended size is: 2560 x 1440

Apologies if this is unorthodox. And thanks either way :) 




 I would save it. Sustain myself through unemployment a bit longer. 




 A PS4 might be worth the investnment in the long run. There's already great games out there like Bloodborne, and more are due to come it's way. If you want to invest in a PS4 now isn't a bad time.

Destiny isn't a bad game, the online is fairly tight. If you want to play with your friends, do so. 




 Gotta sell copies. Gotta reach a wider market. Appeal to a larger demographic. 




 Will try this thanks. I just wasn't too eager to start yanking the strings I just put in. Do not trust my handiwork in the least, going to have to wait a week to be able to play without expecting to get a string twanging in my eye. But will definitely try to do this =] 




 Ron Jeremy? 




 Coming around the same time as the legalisation of gay marriage in the *entire* USA, I think this is a time for the LGBT community to celebrate, not complain. Really, not a week to complain. 




 Hey man, thanks, that's a great answer. Pretty happy to know the best way is to play it, that's what I really wanted to hear :) 




 I humbly await to see the thread :) 




 Are we going to do this the other way? God knows there weren't a few thousand questions I would have loved to anonymously asked a grown-up when I was a teenager.  




 So do I. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't half expecting them to snap off the first time I played them. Not sure how much I ought to trust my handiwork. :) 




 I expect it is. And I also expect that I would really enjoy astronomy, and looking through a telescope, and learning about all the different things from Earth's viewpoint. But I also like my documentaries. 




 There is UE and Unity. But those won't be easy or simple to learn. If you want to pick one, I recommend Unity. It programs physics for you. 

If you want to get serious about gaming, those are the way to go. If you only want to make the one scene, then go with something easier, as previously mentioned. 




 RPG maker.

Roblox. 

Something equally inane like that. 




 The thing about astronomy is that I don't really see it is as anything much more than looking at tiny white dots, and remembering constellations. The only thing worth seeing with the naked eye is Andromeda. (Did you know you can see an entirely different galaxy with the naked eye? How goddamn awesome is that!?). I think there might be more to astronomy than that, but not for me. I like finding out new things, and finding out what quasars are, and what causes some stars to go supernova and some not to, and to see nebulae, and to compare our star to bigger stars, and our galaxy to other galaxies.   




 Whoo! It was a Ukulele which it was pretty new. It took me about an hour to *learn* how to do it. Countless videos and instructions. And then about another hour just to actually get it down. But now Yeah! it's done. Feeling pretty happy and proud with myself. Can't wait to start playing it tomorrow to hear the difference the new, and vastly better strings, will make :)

In other news, I'm now being plagued by a particularly large moth. Dammit. 




 I've spent an ungodly amount of time watching and re-watching space documentaries. I know a lot about space. 




 Whether or not the top starts to fall isn't important, because GET THIS:

*The top wasn't Cobbs totem*

This isn't my own theory, this is one from the internet...

The totem was his wedding ring. Now we know the Top was Mal's totem to begin with. But at the beginning of the film exposition-Arthur explained that anybody else knowing anything about a person's totem negates it. *But Mal is dead* you say? Well, she isn't. Not to Cobb. Who constantly sees her to the point she is the antagonist of the movie. The top being Cobbs totem totally negates it's existence.

But, for the shrewder ones among you, they will have noticed Cobbs ring. In the dream, he is wearing it. Outside of the dream, he isn't. In the ending scene, he isn't. The top doesn't decide it at all.

In fact Nolan has said that the top wobbling at the end isn't anything to do with the dream or not. It's to do with how little Cobb now gives a crap about the dream, the dream-world and his past life. 




 Hey, so, first time I've ever changed strings (yay). I don't even wanna mention how long *that* took. But anyway...So from what I've heard the strings will keep on popping out of tune, and that's fine. At what kind of time will that *stop* happening? So if it continues for longer than it ought to I can probably but it down to the strings being buggared (my own fault).

Also, so the strings need to stretch. Should I give them a while to get used to being stretched, even a little bit? Should I wait until tomorrow to play on them? Or are they good to go - just be prepared to keep on tuning them?

Any other advice or tidbits I missed out which are important? Thanks guys. 




 Because they were both living one life. I think it's just part of the narrative that maintains that they are the same person. They live each others lives, and do each others jobs. It just reinforces that they are the same person. 




 Honestly I haven't read them in years. But I do remember thoroughly enjoying them. 




 The second incarnation of Spider-Man since *that* Venom, and in Marvel's hands? They won't hesitate. 




 They were going to use Giamatti yeah. He might not have been the best, but that suit was excellent.

I don't know about Venom. I'm sure Marvel won't waste any time putting him in there somewhere.  




 Yes, I did. I thought it was a pretty decent film. He's a good actor, and he did well in Jurassic World too. 




 I think they're aiming for October, but it might be a bit later than that. I'm honestly not 100% sure. We have been greenlit on steam, so keep an eye out for it :) 




 They've done a really good job with the game. I have to say. I can't speak for the story, but the game is impressive as hell.  




 You should watch the whole video. It's all on YT or failing that on their own website. Just anything by Neil Gaiman is amazing. Also watching his 2012 commencement speech. It you're not *bleeding* inspiration by the end of it there is no hope for you. 




 I'm working on two. The first one is pretty much done. It's coming out in a few months (excited squeals). Look it up: *Anomaly 1729*

The second is a bit less developed, and is so much work 

How's your game coming along? 




 My instructor was twenty minutes late for the lesson I was meant to have before my test. That lesson was the first time we had done an 'emergency stop', which turned up in the test. It was a fucking shambles. 

Passed first time though :) 




 Fight Club...what?
