 Pffft Shawshank of course. 




 Inherent Vice. 




 *CoughZodiacCough* 




 Into the Wild, by far. 




 Chinatown, Akira, The Wrestler. 




 Can you do more of these? 




 definitely is, OP fucked up the title 









 That was a trip. 




 Same here. He's great, better than Jeremy Jahns IMO 









 Simplify everything. Don't overcomplicate things. Know what you have to do and how. Ask questions. Study.

 When they are pretentious. 




 That humans are in fact a mix of good, bad and fucked up. 









 Prisoners (2013) 

Beautiful but haunting film. I highly recommend. 




 I've been messaging you about it... 




 Love this film. 




 Sorry. My bad. 




 It says $128 on the box... 




 Well that was fucking awesome.

I could go on... 




 I doubt they would use CGI for those scenes.

And, there is ONE scene that simply CANNOT be put onto a film...readers of the book, you know what I'm talking about. *That scene*. 




 The miniseries was exceptional? Umm..... 














 uhhh...Star Wars, Jurassic World, Spectre. 









 Cinematography. Someone wanna help me out? 




 Cheesy ass action movies. Commando, Time Cop, you name it. 




 Blurays. 




 That's me. 




 Includes T.V shows as well. 




 Exactly, studio execs need to stay the fuck out of the actual development process. I hope this still gets made, I was hoping maybe Darren Aronofsky or Nicolas Winding Refn may pick it up. Who knows. Who would you like to see pick this up? 




 I agree completely. This and the blade runner sequel are my two most anticipated films for the next 5 years. Since 'It' is/was supposed to start shooting mid-June, they'll either have to find someone to pick it up or shelve it for good. 














 This movie was going to complete my life. Cary Fukunaga writing and directing? Perfection. Two films instead of one? Perfection. A darker and more violent tone than the miniseries? Perfection. Staying for true to the book? Perfection. Will Poulter as Pennywise? Perfection. Well guess what? New Line just have to go and fuck everything up! According to sources, they were going to cut the budget, only allow for one film AND where going to aim it at teenagers or a younger audience. In other words, they were going to give it the shitty, generic, jump scare-filled horror remake treatment that horror movies are getting these days. 

This just sucks. I hope New Line can pull their heads in and give Cary the space that he needs. 




 "Nobody knows who Will Poulter is! Instead let's hire some 25 year old beefcake nobody!" 




 Have you read the book? If you have, you'd probably be on board for this remake as the Tim Curry Mini series was no where near to the tone of the book and actually really sucked and it didn't do the book any justice. This is the remake the story deserves, and now it's probably not happening. 




 Some new flair system the mods have implemented. I pretty sure it's only on this sub. Complain to them. 




 It's going to get really annoying... 




 The director just dropped out and production has stalled...  




 An unnecessary remake. I hope it's good though.  




 Yes but is he interesting in the source material? You need a director who understands the story and characters. I'm not saying he doesn't but we don't actually know. Plus we need more mature director. 




 Good choice. 




 Such fucking bullshit. Studio excecs only care about the money.  









 That totally sucks. Those words hit me hard. 



















 Fuck yes. This looks incredible. 









 Like Tyler Durden. I don't want to but I'm just interested in how someone would go about doing something like that, giving up all your material possessions, values and consumerist life? 




 Lets see if we can get bigger than /r/Fighclub, I'm talking making a title page banner, weekly discussions about shit etc COME ON 














 Skip to 4:08, you'll get what I'm talking about then. 









 Skip to 4:08, you'll know what I'm talking about then.  









 I was surprised. I immediately thought of the idiot he played in 'We're The Millers' and that had an effect on my overall opinion. But the more I've thought about it the more I've come to think that he is a pretty good choice. The director apparently could not say no after being 'blown away' by his audition. I don't know about you but hearing that from the director just boosts my opinion.  




 The man who is directing it, have you seen any of his other work? True Detective? Sin Nombre? Both of those instilled confidence in me that this man know exactly what he's doing behind a camera. 

Also, what do you think of the casting choice for Pennywise?  




 I fucking shat myself. 




 I drew a fat Batman

 http://r.weavesilk.com/?v=4 id=qsw102mywp8 




 Yeah it is a pretty plain poster. 









 W.....Why? 









 Stoked for the remake? 




 Mr Snowden, what is your favorite film? Also, are you aware that they are currently filming a movie about you starring Joseph Gordon Levitt? 




 Indeed! 




 They all look like decaying buttholes.  




 Nightcrawler is a fucking brilliant Neo-Noir thriller. 




 Wow, thanks for this! 




 The symbolism of Tyler making those rules are so that they would be broken, just like the law. He knew they would break the first rule, preparing them for breaking the law... 




 YES I know I broke the first two rules, Tyler made those rules just so that they would be broken. 

But yeah what is it like on there? Why is it on private? 



















 Being put in a plain metal box the size of a small bathroom and have all the walls close in by 1cm every year. Of course you get fed through a small shaft in one of the walls....bread and water. 




 That last part made me cringe.  




 I somehow doubt It'll be PG-13. 




 My life is now complete. 




 Correct.
 




 You're dead right with the whole 'analyze' thing. Thank you very much for all of this, greatly appreciated. 




 This just makes me even more skeptical for Ant Man.

Good job with this btw. 




 I love Deakins. Thanks for this, had no idea it existed!  




 Any Disney/Pixar film.

 Big Hero 6, oh man. :')

 









 Harrison Ford said it was one of the best he had ever read. 




 :( 




 I've heard elsewhere that the script for the sequel is fucking amazing. I hope this is good. 




 Someone give this guy gold.  









 Who should play the Beatles?  




 I hope they don't do the same thing. I have faith in Miller for him to try something new and different.  




 Mad Fuck Max: Fury Road.

My GOD what an awesome, awesome film!!! Argh I could go on and on about how damn fun this movie is! 









 Some Oscars will be won. 




 Australia has a much better rating system. Here it is what's called MA 15+. 









 Download tor, and start searching. 




 Fuck that was intense. I need to see this now. 

Edit: Directed by Sam Mendes and shot by Roger Deakins? Ok, I need to watch this RIGHT NOW 




 htowntoker713, If Zack Snyder DOES in fact deliver a VERY good film, I am going to give you gold. I have put a shortcut of your account onto my desktop and it will remain their until march 26 or whenever it comes out. You wait and see. If BvS is good film, the gold is yours :) 









 D: 









 That Goonies one brought a big stupid grin to my face. So many memories, thank you so much for these. 









 You dont need to as the new one is not linked to the other 3. I still recommend you do though, they're all great action flicks. 




 Prisoners, anything David Fincher especially Zodiac, Nightcrawler, The Chaser, Inherent Vice (If you're looking for a lighter tone, although it has its dark moments), anything Scorsese (but I'm sure you've seen plenty of his) as far as underrated Scorsese films go I recommend Mean Streets and Casino. Also Mystic River is a fantastic crime drama. 




 Have you read the book? Off the top of my head he'll also (maybe) do the [book spoiler](#s "motion capture for a gigantic demonic alien spider"), play the creature from the black lagoon, a fucking werewolf, a leper, and a fuck tonne of other terrifying shit.

He also may have to eat dead children's corpses as well as kill them. Yay! 




 Yes ahaha same here.  









 He'll look much older in the clown suit and makeup. And trust me, when he is, his age will be the last thing people will be paying attention to. 




 That was fucking intense. 




 Where can I get a copy of it? 




 FUCK THIS MAKES ME MAD!!!! 




 Damn. Maybe his upcoming Civil War epic, The Free State of Jones, can get him back to where he deserves to be.  









 [Literally Kevin Feige right now](https://i.imgur.com/BGOEqBn.gif) 




 Fuck I'm a retard. 




 Who? 




 Holy shit. r/moviescirclejerk have gone all out in circle jerking MM:FR, I repeat, ALL OUT. 




 I was just thinking, if the director of BIRDMAN thinks Will Poulter is good enough to star in 'The Revenant' alongside big names such as Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, and the director of TRUE DETECTIVE thinks he's good enough to play Pennywise then that must mean that this kid has some serious talent, and we haven't seen any of those films yet.

What are your thoughts?
 














 This is kinda cool. Even if Attack of the clones is shit. Try and do a Blade Runner meets Drive video, it'll work a lot better. 




 Bang! Mystic River it is! 




 Nope. Good guess. 




 Can you guess [this](http://imgur.com/4RQNtH0) one? Good luck
