 It's almost like we got better in the offseason. Maybe not in terms of individual parts but in terms of cohesion and balance. Parsons is a better player than Ariza but Ariza is a much better fit than Parsons was.  




 Also we're awesome. 




 I guess we can't use the schedule excuse anymore. 




 Made you cringe because you're a dork who takes themself too seriously. The dude himself was laughing and having a good time with it but you couldn't exit your own ego to do the same.  




 You poor guy.  




 Why in the world did you feel the need to bring up that (completely seeped in opinion) thought? 




 If it makes you feel any better, she wouldn't have gotten with you even if she was single.  




 Not the absolute worst though, really.  




 Yeah because there isn't more filling than pancake in that picture.  




 Man I guarantee you kids still get up early Saturday mornings to watch cartoons. 




 Dry? Whichever of your parents was American sucked at making pancakes.  




 I'm not trying to be rude here but if your wife is hoping for regular viewers of her blog, someone should really proof read and edit her text. Pretty pictures though and jealous of that sandwhich right now. 




 those are watermelons. 




 Seriously though, where are watermelons $26.99? 




 Jesus fuck dude, I was making a joke. My point was to make people chuckle.  




 I never said I was doing it out of compassion.  




 I'd honesty rather just stab it in its fucking brain.  




 You know...like, for Portland.  




 It's great. I cut them up into slices and scoop up the yogurt. Really cuts down the chalky/dry of 0%. I use fag and its my favorite of all the ones I've tried. A cup of yogurt and 1/2 or a full red pepper. Fills me up.  




 Raspberries, bananas and apples tend to do the trick for me.  




 Eggs (I do one yolk per 4 egg whites for flavor/fat), bananas, raspberries, edamame or baked soy beans, celery/red peppers w/ 0% Greek yogurt, black beans. Basically anything dense in protein/fiber.  




 You keep division rivalries if you keep divisional playoff seeding, because your greatest threat to the playoffs is still your inter-division equal.

 Reposts aren't pure evil.  




 Just saying it's hard to objectively compare stats between different positions. Just as far as getting a body on the ball carrier, LBs are in a consistently better position to do so. Von Miller is a phenomenal player though, don't get me wrong. 




 Von Miller is also a LB while JJ Watt is a DE. 




 That's erect

 Compare the amount of NBA players in FIBA to the amount of NBA players in the WNBA.

It's pretty simple really. 




 They act as if WNBA (or women's basketball in general) topics are a constant plague of this subreddit

dude... no body acts like that. 




 Jesus Christ, not everyone is an audiophile nerd. Some people value percieved value and style over ultimate value. The average person will not be able to tell the sound difference between audiotechnica mh50s and beats but everyone will be able to see the difference.

We get it guys, your $100 steinhouses are superior to beats in every single way. Guess what? No one gives a shit. You're a bargain shopper, pat yourself on the back and get over it. 




 Well, they are friends with the biggest kid on the playground.  









 haha I'll do that. I really dig the sound, man. Sign something for me in case y'all get famous?

 Baked beans, despite the name, are usually stewed. 




 Nice man! Should share them. Just started getting into him when this newest album came out, and was hooked by Summer Cum.  




 Re-fried beans can be fried or baked.  




 the raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste *is then* ***baked*** or **fried** with lard or vegetable oil and seasoned to taste with salt and spices.

 If Cowboys are Texans and Cowboys are American Icons than Texans are also American Icons. Also Chandler.  




 Stick with it man. 18 months no internet or cable for me. 88 pounds lost, no more depression, no more social anxiety, more girls, more friends, more adventures, more life. Obviously there was a lot more that went into that but cutting the Internet and cable was the first step which allowed me to start taking more and bigger ones. It's possible and you might find one day that not only do you not miss it but you relish the freedom of un-connectivity.  




 Cut the internet too. I did it about 18 months ago, said goodbye and it has been the best change I've made in a really long time. You people are lying to yourselves if you think you *need* it. 

For me personally it was a health and lifestyle decision but not supporting those monopolies with my business has been a nice side effect. 




 As opposed to the creative masterpiece of a name that is 'Cowboys'. It just makes it too busy, is in a weird spot, and just doesn't fit. Sorry, Chandler. 




 I like the white ones but the blue ones need to lose that Dallas Cowboy star. 




 Obama didn't de-escalate anything in Iraq. He left on the timeline Bush negotiated after trying to renegotiate to keep US troops there longer.

Bush signed the SOFA Accord but the war *was still going on* and Obama was the one who presided over the actual complete withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq. It's one thing to sign such an agreement at the end of your final term and another to actually follow through on it. The SOFA Accord was signed 5.5 years after the invasion of Iraq. Lets not pretend that Bush ended anything. He introduced the framework for his successor, but his successor still had to end the hostilities. Would McCain have backtracked on SOFA had he been elected? If you believe yes (which his words leading up to the election would indicate), then how could you not agree that Obama was the one who actually ended the war? We invaded without UN approval, what makes you think a flimsy withdrawal agreement couldn't have been superseded?

He increased the troop numbers in Afghanistan for years with no benefit, or clear mission, before finally pulling back troops.

The idea was the same coin as the successful 'troop surge' in Iraq during Bush's presidency. Just like in Iraq, it worked until the surge subsided. The problem with both conflicts was that there was *never* a clear desired outcome, we wandered in without a goal and with outdated strategy and the people of Iraq and Afghanistan paid the price.

He completely botched Libya

How so? The goal was to support dissidents of Qaddafi in a bid to oust him from power, which was accomplished with intelligence sharing and the targeted strikes of Libyan military assets. Unless you mean botched as in he botched it by getting involved in the first place; an assertion which time will paint a more detailed picture of and you could very well be right on.

and funneled weapons to Syrian rebels, many of whom were Islamist terrorists.

I'm not going to argue with you on that one. I really don't know where I stand on the whole Syrian Civil War or our involvement.

He tried to get involved in Syria very early on and only backed down when there was a large public backlash. You don't remember the whole redline comment?

See, the fact that he backed down when there was a large public backlash is an important point to me.

Obama doesn't get credit just because he didn't get involved in every little skirmish.

When your country has been at the forefront of foreign military intervention since the 1950s, I think you should get a little credit when your foreign policy shifts slightly from that precedent.

Bush had international support when he started his wars, too, as well as congressional ***and UN approval***.

Not in Iraq. International support was paltry at best and UN approval was non-existent.

If anything, he's doubled down on all of the previous administration's follies.

I just can't agree with that when one of those admins started two separate trillion plus dollar ground wars and the other didn't. 

I'm just saying Obama is not anything like the peacenik you're trying to paint him as.

I'm not painting him like a peacenik, I just disagree that he is a war-hawk.

His foreign policy isn't perfect. Far from it, it's lukewarm at best. I don't agree with a great deal of his foreign policy but I do think it's a step in the right direction away from his predecessor (because tepid isn't great but it's better than scalding water for washing your hands).

You should take off your blinders and see what he's really been up to.

You should save the personal attacks for personal arguments.  




 100% false. Bush ended the Iraq war, Obama wanted to stay.

If Bush ended the Iraq war, how could his successor want to say?

The Iraq War didn't end until December of 2011, Obama was elected in 2008 and took office in January 2009.

Nice rebuttal, you're off to a good start. 

Um...Do what? Limited by what standards? No occupation?

Uh, yeah. Limited as in limited. Limited as in minimizing war resource allocations.

We always try and claim international support. We did the same thing in Iraq.

Well we *did* initially have a lot of international support in Afghanistan and Iraq to a lesser extent but then we stayed there for a decade, and rightfully lost it.

You seem to think unless we are invading and occupying everything is ok.

I absolutely do not think that, and for you to jump to *that* conclusion based off my comment tells me more about you than you not knowing which president ended the War in Iraq (and confidently not knowing it to boot).

The only thing he hasn't done is a full scale invasion....everything else is 100% Bush policy.

Right...the only thing he hasn't done is get the US stuck in 2 separate trillion+ dollar wars which significantly hurt our international standing and isolated us from our allies.

But I mean really, Obama's foreign policy diverges enormously from GWB's, for better or for worse. 

 




 Firkin and Fenix seems to have a divese NFL crowd, and it plays all the games.  




 Care to elaborate? De-escalated/ended war in Iraq from US presence standpoint; de-escalating Afghanistan from US presence standpoint; limited involvement in Libya (air strikes + intelligence); limited/no involvement in Egypt; limited/no involvement in Iraq/Palistine; refusal to join the fight in Syria for 4 years; no action in Ukraine; delayed action against ISIS until now (according to the West chatterbox). And you look at the conflicts we've been involved in (that weren't inhereted) and they share the common bond of international support. 

If anything he's been trying very hard not to repeat what he saw as the previous administration's biggest folley.  




 This is neat and all but you're not even gonna post any picture?  




 Apparently you're wrong dude because he didn't get a red.  




 If the NFL was smart, he'd be the player face of the NFL.  




 Maybe y'all are both just fat. Just because she puts sugur in her coffee doesn't mean she's wrong. It just means she's a hypocrite and y'all both tub.

 Man I couldn't even imagine swiping right 6,000 times. What's your guesstimate on your match ratio per right swipe? I'm at like 1/10 but prob only swipe right 1/10 of the time. Kind of curious what would happen if I swiped right on the next 200 girls.  




 You forgot about the choking hazard that comes with anything edible :p 




 I know, I just was curious how many times 300k went into 2.5 billion. 




 It would take them 8,333 days to recoup 2.5 billion dollars at that rate. 




 That's impressive in a collectibles kind of way. Selective swipes or do you just go full right? 




 How long did that take? 




 Well real coke can kill you by itself under the right(wrong?) circumstances but I get what you're saying.  




 Shrooms can kill you too if you're unlucky.  




 You need a new coke dealer.

 Well... Better than your usual Friday where you do absolutely nothing with your life. So instead of nothing, you just created something absolutely retarded and which will never get used. You'll be happier when you try outside of rreddit.  




 Oh em gee, reddit gold, my completely blas life still means something. Fuck, I'm lonely.  




 S'all good. I understand where you were coming from, and it definitely could have led to personal bashing, but that was never my intent :) 




 Follow your dreams, bro. And update us when it happens. 




 Haha really? You're not Michael too, are you?

 I know... The whole point was that Central Park is super busy so people throwing organic refuse in it would not be the same as throwing it in the woods with little foot traffic and lots of space.

Central Park - Lots of Space, lots of foot traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: lots of traffic)

'a park' - minimal space, low traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: minimal space)

'the woods - lots of space, minimal traffic = fine to throw organic refuse. (see: lots of space, minimal traffic)

Hope that makes sense. I'm sure we're on the same page, just not connecting for whatever reason. 




 Well obviously there would be more to it than just saying "standardize them" on the internet. Just because a problem is complex and complicated doesn't mean there aren't solutions. At the very least, ban any future stadiums from using the same design the Texans have implemented.

 Standardize for indoor and outdoor.  




 Oh man, not your feed! Everyone, this guy's feed is wasted with people overly excited about their sex lives. We must correct this immediately; from now on, no sex posts. Hope that helps, yanks209.

If it really bothers you just filter out the words you see a lot that you don't like to see, like 'sex', 'blowjob' and 'fingerblasted'.

edit: see, if you guys just downvoted and ignored the sex posts like you did my comment, you might end up with content you want. hope my sacrifice was productive. 




 Not really. Not with the amount of foot traffic it gets. Sure it's big, but it probably has more foot traffic per acre than your average small neighborhood park.  




 I know man. I wish there were more mature adults like us on Reddit. Kids these days. Amiright? 




 Yes, pretty big for a park in the middle of a city, but it's not 'the woods'. It's what, 800 acres? With what, 30 million visitors a year?

 




 Shiner is though.  




 Pretty sure psychiatrists are legally obligated to bring it to the attention of police. Could have just pulled that out of my ass, too lazy to fact check.  




 There's a difference between a park and 'the woods'.  




 I do that but I roll my cigarettes and usually don't have a filter. And I also pick up random trash a lot because I do still feel a little guilty. Also I don't drive so at least I'm not contributing that problem. *ahem*
