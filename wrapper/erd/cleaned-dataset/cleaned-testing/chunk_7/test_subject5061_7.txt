 Yes you have the perfect personality to be a mod. You may also want to see if the condo association board is looking for new members. There have been an inordinate number of young people cutting across the lawn lately.   




 TIL is not the place for your juvenile attempts at trolling

If you check the commenting history, it was YOU who began attacking me with trolling comments.

I suggest that if you wish to be a mod then apply for the position and get hired as such. No one likes trolls or internet white knights 




 Why would you assume that /u/bisfitty is white?

Why would you assume bisfitty isn't? Maybe you need to check your white privilege  




 For your information, "Mister Rodgers" was just an average Joe. He was also African American. He was murdered in the streets of Buffalo, NY. Apparently your white privilege doesn't afford you the empathy to give a shit about someone like that.    




 Wait are you suggesting that reddit is other than a noble and scholarly depository of serious knowledge?

 13 of 22 billionaires who made political contributions gave to Liberal candidates. That means more billionaires support Liberals than Conservatives.  
























 George Soros? T. Steyer? M. Bloomberg? Aren't they Liberals?

 "The indigenous people of East Greenland made this sort of underwear, known as naatsit, by sewing strips of seal pelt together using a thread of reindeer or whale sinew. The naatsit , decorated with glass beads tied onto seal-skin fringe, was made for women and worn under seal-skin trousers."

"...this beaded, furry thong was intended to be displayed not just during intimate moments, but in polite company. Inside the warm homes of the Greenlandic Inuit, a naatsit "was the only thing worn even when having guests or visiting the houses of other families,"

 Appleseed! 




 My original comment was that Liberals lie about everything. I contend that the entire Liberal point of view is based not on logical, factual debate versus Conservative's logical, factual points but on the fact that Liberals must necessarily lie to disguise their faulty arguments. In other words, Liberals can't win debates based on facts so they have to resort to lies.

The five points you offer above prove this. You rely not on any real or actual Conservative view points but instead rely on the false narrative that Liberals claim Conservatives hold. AKA you rely on lies and not on actual Conservative views. 

In reality, Conservatives have factual, logical, philosophicaly based reasons why they hold the views they have. 

As a Tea Party Conservative, I am not a racist. I get my news from many sources and not from any Fox News echo chamber. I oppose socialism, Leftism, Progressivism philosophically because they are the antithesis of Jeffersonian Democracy. I have no business overlords and I am an atheist.  I oppose Obama, Bernie Sanders, Hillary, Liz Warren and every other Leftist based on their views and policies. I have scientific reasons why I doubt that anthropogenic climate change is a serious issue or that the proposed solutions would offer any difference.

I don't believe that you are consciously lying. I believe that you and other Liberals are being fed lies by the media, academia, entertainment, and fellow Liberals who then form opinions based on false information.

I believe Liberals lie so that any debate on the facts never takes place. Conservatives are demonized as haters so that their views never have to even be considered.   

  




 Can you tell me why Conservatives oppose the issues above? I am curious if you actually believe that Conservatives have rational, logical, well thought out and sincere reasons why they hold the positions they have on political issues.

Oh and all of the issues above ARE political issues to Conservatives.

Well? 




 Liberals incorrectly claim that Conservatives:

1. Oppose Obamacare because they are racist

2. Oppose climate change because they are anti science

3. Oppose any female candidate because they are anti women

4. Oppose gay marriage because of homophobia

5. Oppose immigration reform due to being xenophobic 




 Seriously, can you tell me one issue where Liberals accurately  portray Conservatives views?

 More realistic  scenario: All politicians are gutless cowards. As soon as 25 citizens and police were killed they would back down. Some lame negotiation would result in a return to pre violence status quo.

 Of course. Atwater stated that the GOP was trying to attract disaffected southern Democrat voters be focusing on economic issues rather than appeals to racism. That was a Reagan adviser 40 years ago.

Many uneducated people misunderstand the Southern Strategy or do so intentionally for political gain. 

 How do his comments on the Southern strategy prove the false claim that the GOP is racist?  




 The Democrats were overt racists and supported slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, created the Klan, and opposed civil rights for blacks.

The GOP was the party of Lincoln and supported the end of slavery, integration, and civil rights .

These are indisputable facts.

Democrats renounced overt racism during the civil rights movement and should be commended for that.

There exists no proof whatsoever that the GOP changed course and embraced racism, fielded racist candidates, or supported racist policies.

The Left has pushed this lie for political reasons  to squelch debate on the merits of the issues and to influence uneducated or disinterested voters.

 The GOP is the same as it was in 1865 and the 1950's when Ike sent in federal troops to force Democrat governors to integrate.
