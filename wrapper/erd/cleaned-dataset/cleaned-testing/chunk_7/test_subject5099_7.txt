 With the Departure of Nisovin and Rob, I will be following and supporting them like I did when I first joined PlayMindcrack. I hope the best for Guude, and I hope that maybe he can do something to keep his server alive too, but at it's core, Nisovin and Rob were PMC, they were the games, and they were AT LEAST half the community, and I will stick by their side, as I have from the start. 




 Well, KGM is under Rob's jurisdiction as well, so I see that going with him, as well as WAT, I presume. Camelot I'm not sure who that's under, as well as RoC and PJT.

 good job :L
 




 Mexican posted before you, you cannot host at this time without proof of permission. 




 Whitelist will be off at :45, for those that are waiting. 




 Not the time, nor the place, there's another thread you could just have easily said this, and if what rebexer said is true, then you should be less of a hypocrite. 




 Time to go, although, while being known for what you do is nice and all, I wasn't known at all on the gym until I became 10th on the leaderboard, that's when I go noticed. However, even if getting noticed is a good thing to come from the boards, they do so much more damage than good to me, and others, so it seems. The board should be removed, that's my opinion. 




 Honestly, although matt is in a case of ban evasion, he was only banned for bad fellowship, and so he himself is not cheating, and all his kills are legit, as one person, as much as he can play. FWP is not one person, can play any maximum of its time its members are on, and while there isn't modded clients in use as far as we know, and play time is not a bannable by any means, it seems very unsportsman-like to use one single account just for the purpose of bringing someone who got all his kills as one person, fairly, down, just on account of his past ban that doesn't have anything to do with his ability to kill.

tl;dr, Op got his kills as one person, fairly, it's unsportsmanlike to use a group on one account to do the same. 




 Sadly, I would not put it past some people that were once or still are in the community to do these things. Some groups are maliciously toxic, while others are very very nice. The thing is, those that are toxic are sometimes the popular ones, and they are part of the reason I am no longer playing on the server. My situation, as well as another friend of mine's are very similar to your's in terms of falling into a depression. I do not attribute these people alone as the cause of this, but I do site them as partial reason, as well as the boards, and other goings on in my life. It makes me very sad to see a community fall into something like this, but I am happy that someone brought it to light, something I couldn't do. 




 And our top Paladin being a bunch of people on one account is any better? it feels wrong to the community to do that. 




 While I have a personal bias due to people being rude to me in a similar manner, the *penguins* as it were, are known to share many alt accounts. While this on its own is not really against the rules, it is a relatively common occurrence.  




 THAT. IS. PERFECT. I love it :D:D:D:D:D 
 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/2dajay/request_a_drawing_of_these_two/ On the pier, in the moonlight, please? :s Or walking down a road at night, hand in hand. whichever you prefer, be creative :D
 




 [These](http://m.imgur.com/gws57nI) two, possibly firing bows at zombies down a mountain? [Same characters,](http://m.imgur.com/a2lWl3Q) more realistic example. Thank you in advance! 




 Any drawing of [these](http://m.imgur.com/gws57nI) characters in any style, I would love. Realistic like [this](http://m.imgur.com/a2lWl3Q) is preferable, but I'd love anything really! One of the things I'd really like is these two on a pier in the moonlight, but still, anything would be nice! Thank you in advance! :D 




 It works, thank you :D 




 A drawing of [these](http://m.imgur.com/gws57nI) characters, I would love. I'd really like these two on a pier in the moonlight. Thank you in advance! :D 




 I got pushed out because of the community, sadly :/

 Tier progressions 




 gg friends, twas a good game
 




 says on "blacklist of items" at the bottom
 




 if all the dwarves were in the shrine, that be fine, but if not, you killed all the dwarves that needed to get back in to repair or regen mana or whatnot. 




 He wasn't wrong, blocking off does kill dwarves. You would need more of an explanation to actually be able to convey your point.
 




 Did you actually read the post? It says it right on Team size.
 




 It was 1.5x gold, just a little edit. 




 I miss short games 




 nono, you are correct, they dont show up until those 5 are exausted 




 and patrons do not get double, they get 1.5x 




 FBI's game was posted first 




 I don't enjoy the indoors anymore, but I used to, now it's just about who has the most slabs and the most wrenches, it's not about tunnels anymore. Tunnels are pointless anymore 




 Honestly I have more fun with short and quick games, these new hour and a half long games are basically the reason I quit, they give me such a bad headache.

PS: Why is this downvoted? are you serious? It was a statement, my god.

PSS: This community is so broken now, all these downvotes on Mae's statements even though he is just trying to show his point, quite sad guys. People have opinions, they aren't necessarily wrong, and he has no reason to be downvoted. 




 Longer and more kills does not necessarily mean more fun. 




 It's unfortunate this is so downvoted, as you seem to have the same problems with the game now as I do, and it is the reason I have quit.

edit: lol, ironically being downvoted for a statement about downvoting. 




 Could I join?
 




 May I ask what IrishBrawler (on the 2nd to last picture) is saying, what's that supposed to mean? of course, only if you know, by chance. 




 You all think this is a joke, it's not. 




 The special weapons do not give any bonus damage or any other buff, they merely have a different name and shine.
 




 Hasn't gotten any better really. 




 The boards to me have done so much more damage then ingame, and I want them gone so badly. 




  Milky Way
 




  Server Info: this server is a 4GB server hosted in PA, USA, North America, Earth, Milky Way.

But which Universe and Dimension?
 




 but it has nothing to do with what's happened in game, people just focus others based on personal grudges.  




 I myself lost the whole team feeling when people started to form their own little groups and hold certain people up higher than others. It makes people not in these groups plain feel like crap as they're not included and sometimes discriminated against. Can't say you feel like you're on a team when someone on that team punches out your torches because they don't like you, or let their friends that are mobs just focus you all game. 




 Virendra also can't one shot AI zombies

 Typical First time hosts, don't know how. 




 there's no top 3 medal afaik, just #1, #2 - #10, and then #11 - #100 




 My First hero was nearly a year ago on the gym, and it was Roamin on Molgan. Spammed the OP Holy Purifier right down the entranceway, harvested kills for days. 




 No, the upgrade was removed because the armor system is going to be revamped.

 Still think my hero idea for the ShepherdofFire from the link TetrixxYT has below would fit into the DvZverse nicely.
 




 You can actually make these yourself, simply going into your server textures file, changing the playmindcrack one into the same format as a resource pack, and then replacing the files from the resource pack of choice with the playmindcrack ones with the items you wish to change. 




 Magma Cream Represent!
 




 Alpha Gym Represent!
 




 You may think PlayMindcrack is unlikely to go down, but it's predecessor, Bruce's Gym, which used the same systems and had a lot of fans too, could not operate due to the low amount of donations, and was abandoned. Donators are more likely to donate if they have incentive, even if that incentive is only silly and fun. Getting nothing doesn't bode well for servers, and it won't. 




 What happens when you have servers like PlayMindcrack, that is coded and run by someone with a loyal fanbase, that wont work anywhere else, because they actually own the rights to a lot of the minigames? These servers are run for hundreds of dollars, you can't expect one man with all that money to all of a sudden run a server. 




 People already do.
