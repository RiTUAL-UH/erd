 You could have a slot in your casket where the money is inserted, like an arcade machine.
  
No slugs or tokens! 




 So either your casket is going to be made out of cake, or your name is Beatrix. 









 I lost 80 pounds in the span of a year in my 20's.

It was great, but the only downside was the extra floppy skin I had around my stomach. I looked like someone stuffed a pancake in a muffin tin.

Lots of hard work after losing that initial weight has helped out in that area, but it's still not as tight as I'd like it to be. 




 Cats would be atheists. 




 Damn. That's not going to be good for me that day. At least I can get her a replacement, then. 

Thanks for the help! I appreciate it. 



















 I'd ask an elephant where I put my favorite koozie. 




 Apocalypse. I could be his fifth horseman...Sloth. 




 Irish people love to drink.

I've been Irish before and I'll probably be Irish again this weekend. 




 Play with your hair while talking to me. Also, a small eyebrow raise when I say something flirtatious. 




 When I was a kid, I believed that my tongue went all the way down my esophagus to my stomach. 




 Dying alone. 




 It's full of interesting bits of information. 




 Check all physical connections to the router. Hard reset if need be. 




 Definitely not like [this](https://youtu.be/xz0i94ABgD0). 




 I'd like to buy a Bob Barker, Alex. 




 Marriage. By next century, we'll all have sex bots. 




 Is it normal to send yourself dick pics? 




 At a bulimia support group. 




 Bosco...err...I mean, bingo! 




 I opened the door to my mom's Camaro as she was pulling into our gravel driveway. For some reason, my 8 year old self didn't have a seatbelt on and I went tumbling out. If she hadn't stopped the car when she did, my head would've been ran over by the back tire. Instead, I have a Harry Potter-like scar on my forehead to this day. 




 Buying Chinese parts and passing them off as ours. 100% made in America...right. 




 Why does my wife not love me? 




 That 80's Show. 




 Summer of George! 




 Why? How did it go? 




 ...and your legs. 




 Greg Giraldo. 




 Having someone rub my back until I fall asleep. 




 "I don't love you anymore." 




 Money. 




 Could it be my own? 




 Good thing that rail is there for head banging support. 




 Just because you put a line through the middle of something...that doesn't make it symmetrical (as shown by most of those clips). 




 Why is there an armrest on the left side of the driver's seat? 




 Toss them in front of cars that are behind me in traffic. 




 And is he bothering you at all...while he is across the aisle, with his headphones in, and minding his own business? 




 Before typing a response to this post, I mean. That reply is obvious. 




 The One With The Naked Naps 














 I lick the bottom of my shoe every Saturday to build up my immune system. 



















 I would yunk their brains out. 




 Choke them with a moose cock? 




 (   ) 




 My wife's vibrator. 




 Don't get married. It will hurt your heart in the end. 




 Double ew. 
























 If I took a shot to the liver so hard it made me feel like I shit in my boxers (heh...boxers), I'd appreciate whatever that person wanted me to appreciate. 




 I wonder what body part she'd punch you in if you touched her with your dick, instead of your elbow? 




 You should've taught them the wrong way to punch.  
  
"Ok, ladies.  What you want to do here is keep your fingers nice and loose.  Fold that thumb under your other fingers to protect it.  Also you always want to keep your wrist limp." 




 At least you didn't stick your dick in that crazy. 




 That's some dirty fighting, right there. 




 She must've learned her Muay Thai skills on the streets.  That and how to suck a dick for some coke. 




 Maybe you just found a new way for a girl to touch your junk.
  
"Hey girl.  Imma show you how to punch.  Just aim for the hands and if you miss and hit above my dick...next time just go a little lower and a lot softer."  
  
I like your style. 




 You're like the male version of Rosa Parks. 




 Seriously, fuck her.  Hate sex is great...from what I've seen in a movie. 




 [Or...](https://youtu.be/NEdPV-mh1js?t=18s) 




 I know.  That's why I edited my reply that was submitted before you edited yours. 




 Why didn't you retaliate on her? 




 Smelly? 




 What was the song?  
  
Edit: That's a relaxing melody. 




 He is definitely  a disturbed person. 




 How old were you? 




 Man, you shoulda been bobbin' and weavin'! 




 Is that a movie or a sex move that I don't know about? 




 And then cry alone in the bathroom afterwards? 




 What would she do? 




 Was she ugly? 




 What was she aiming for that she missed and hit you in your batch? 




 "I'll touch him alright...with a shoulder check, a trip, and what the hell...I'll throw in a left elbow to his outside ovaries." 




 How was it your fault?
