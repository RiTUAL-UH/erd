 Really? Cos I've seen videos where she talks about games she likes. Also basically all of her criticisms on youtube start with "it's possible to both simultaneously enjoy and criticize", which is true, not many games are 100% perfect. 

I think people are very sensitive about what she says instead of accepting that like many critics out there she only mentions something if it's a problem. That doesn't = she hates all games. I prefer her positive criticism, of what I've seen, though, but I like positive criticism from most people, negativity is less appealing to me personally. 




 Sounds like you've got quite the list already, good luck! Don't feel bad if a game doesn't click, if you've got something else to try there's nothing wrong with changing things up. Have fun! 




 Am i the only one who likes engaging with all forms of polite criticism including hers? She makes some good points sometimes so I think its unfair to generalise about her work.

I don't always agree, but its good to hear different views. 




 Walking dead is so sad ): never cried in a game before, but wow, i cried so so much :/ 




 Makes sense PC is easier to develop for, given the open platform :) 




 I'm assuming you are an adult, cos some of these games are only suitable for age 18+

**Deus Ex Human Revolution** - First person action RPG shooter/stealth game, dialogue options and cyberpunk storyline.
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-DwoCkpBFA

**Saints Row 4** - Parody/comedy game, follow a bunch of (strangely likable) psychopaths saving the world. Extensively create your own character, pick female or male protagonist with multiple voice options. Game parodies games like Mass Effect, I love ME and this game was very entertaining for me.
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51OztTj9r5M

**Any of these telltale games** (contains dialogue options, almost like an interactive movie or TV show - not super long and the last two aren't all out yet, gameplay is mostly quicktime events and dialogue):
The Walking Dead S1 2 (will make you cry) - Fan Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIq1bpzxCZw

The Wolf Among Us (neo noir) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_St9DTuO0

Tales from The Borderlands (comic roguish adventure - apparently you don't have to know the previous games, according to friends I have who have played it - I haven't played it yet but heard good things) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Od_savz7A

Game of Thrones (If you like the show) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZeJfIvy3Ck

**LA Noire** (LA confidential style cop drama): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeYym1U226M

 I love that log bridge in Skyrim, it feels so epic fighting over a waterfall. 

Falling off a cliff on my horse in Red Dead Redemption :/ and I'm fairly sure that's actually quite hard to do! 




 I do gaming criticism/comment (also develop my own little games) - but I focus on keeping a positive perspective. It's an attempt to counter the tone of videos that focus on anger/outrage. 

I've tried not to post the channel too much on reddit because of self promotional rules, so if anyone wants to share them if they like them, feel free :)

Only two videos so far, but got lots planned :) Enjoy! 

Peace

 Find games that you enjoy and you want to play, don't let other people tell you what games are the "right" games to play. If you need recommendations, what kinds of games/stories are you interested in? I'm sure people here could recommend some, for PS2 right?

Well nobody asked :) Done two so far, the latest is probably the slickest.   




 The beauty of the internet is you can probably find communities and content creators that suit your tastes. 

I personally have misgivings about the very pessimistic and snarky tone the dialogue about this art form has cultivated. I dislike outrage culture very strongly - I feel like that energy could be better spent on actual world problems. Although cordial and polite critique on a variety of issues is absolutely fine. I agree with you about Danny O'Dwyer, but I like him because he's calm, clear and concise. He doesn't beat the outrage drum, and I appreciate that. 

Conversely to you, I actually like many elements of every outlet you mentioned. However, broadly speaking any sort of outrage turns me off, this is supposed to be an artform for discussion, not anger, bitterness or incivility - at least that's how I feel about it.

 




 He was basically naked lol :P nah ur right i meant Big Boss in Mgs3 and Peacewalker 




 A suicide squad game would be awesome, I just hope they make sure Harley Quinn is more of a goofball psychopath, rather than the sexy booby schtick the Arkham games have given her. What can I say, I love classic Harley ;) 




 Unfortunately, a lot of popular games videos and stories revolve around outrage and they get voted to the top. I strongly believe this can be counteracted through passionate, but positive, games videos and articles. 

E.g. Superbunnyhops MGS2 video - insightful, but also positive. 

I've started making videos on the basis of not being negative or angry, for that very reason. Hopefully one day they will be popular enough for people to post on /r/games 




 Haha, yeah fair call. Snake has a "naked" getup ever since MGS3 I believe, so maybe, here's hoping she's got some different getups like proper camo etc. 




 I am so interested to see how the themes of this game play out. GZ was a brutal condemnation of Gitmo, always loved how Kojima fits smart with the surreal/off-beat.

I also love how you don't always have to play as snake, which is cool. 




 I only really watch Criminal Intent would have defs played a telltale game with Goren and Eames 




 See their portraits in the menu, also i think quiets costume can be changed in the menu too. 




 With the 12x XP Boost the game is great now, I managed to level up to 50 with my Jedi Knight in a few days when it had took me 3 years on and off to just get my Sith Warrior to Lvl 40.

I've been playing on and off F2P, what is a 12x xp boost and how do I get one? I also just play for story. 




 It's the same actor, but I don't think the characters will be the same at all. At least I hope not. 




 My biggest issue with Arkham Games is the redesign of Harley Quinn, It's not a game breaker for me, but I always loved Harlequin designed Harley. I don't feel she needs to be "attractive" in terms of sexuality. She's more of a goofball maniac after all. 




 Yeah! Something eerie, but appealing about Animal Crossing's "perfect life" atmosphere. haha.
