 Nope. My vacations ate going on, so I am not procrastinating anything :) 









 /uj The AutoMod replies are getting really annoying now. 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 You should! 




 My favourite is running and cricket :) 




 Yup, or was pretty sad. The first 10 minutes of Up were sadder, though. 




 Which sport do you like the most? :) 




 I love Toy Story 3. It was an amazing movie. 




 Toy Story trilogy :) 




 You favourite movie? 




 Not a lot of rules, it has as many as a normal sport. What's the most popular sport in your country? 




 Playing Cricket is really fun, and it's the most popular game here in India. And, you should really watch HTTYD. It's one if my favourite movies
 




 #BuyANexus 




 I woke up a few hours ago, and now I would play cricket (heard about the game?) with my friends. Yesterday I saw How To Train Your Dragon 1   2, and both were really good movies. 




 Hi! How's your day going? 




 I don't really watch a lot of TV, so I don't have a favorite show :) 




 Besides code, I really don't know :P  




 Currently I just finished my 10 th grade, so I didn't really do anything yet to pursue the goals. I would love to be a coder! 




 I would like to see myself in a good university in five years... I hope I would be in a good university doing Computer Science. 




 I would love some random questions :) 




 Mmmm....   Probably just fooling around, troubling people :P 




 Toy Story (1,2   3). I just love them. 




 I would go for truth! 




 implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed. 




 /u/Flexxkii has wonderfully done it. This is the best implementation of Naut 3 I've ever seen. 




 I almost cried during the first 10 minutes of Up. 




 As you have counted Toy Story, I would also like to count in Up. The first 10 minutes were too damn emotional.

 Seriously. AP has shown themselves to be the only Android news blog that takes itself seriously. They consistently produce new, useful, substantiated content. I don't see many other android journalists (or even other journalists in other fields) do as fantastic 
of a job as you guys do.


The APK teardowns, fantastic sources of information. Don't see others doing this. You don't just post "Oh boy i think this is happening rumor rumor rumor." You go through the code line by line to see what it could mean. That's dedication.
Every week, the "x apps of the week." Awesome! What a great way to find apps. Original reviews, insightful and honest opinions, I love it!


All other general news. Always original content. Rarely do I see recycled "this rumor happened" and "this is coming out" like I do from literally every other blog.


Getting to know Android x.x.x. Perfect. Probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever.
Basically, what I'm trying to say, is thank you so much for putting out actual content. Thank you for not trying to get pageviews from "hot" titles and "latest rumors!" Thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post.


Seriously, I love you guys. I hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many of your stories hit the front page! But even still, I wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful I am (and we all are)! Stick around, and keep up the fantastic work! We don't take it for granted, even if it might seem like it sometimes!


**tl,dr; I LOVE YOU ANDROID POLICE! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! 3** 




 I seriously love these new shorts! 




 Not running M Preview.


Damn, you're old.


not Google+


You have disgraced Lord DuARTe. 




 You have been indefinitely blessed. 




 He's totally awesome :D 




 Dhruv? 




 Baymax!

 TIL ladfrombrad is Thor.

 Chrome custom tabs look amazing! 




 I am waiting for DuARTe, too. His speech is at the end :( 




 But his phone won't crash with an SMS.

**HTC SHILL DETECTED!** 




 You might be better off getting /u/LocutusOfBorges 's phone number. 




 It's 11.00 PM here, so I'm not sleepy...


 




 Yup, all keynotes start at night for us :( 




 That's even worse! 




 Hey, I have a Red Bull can lying around in my fridge, that might help! 




 I love the timer. It's amazing! 




 M0DS 




 I hope I can stay up! 




 India/GMT+5.30. I don't want to miss the Material Now event today :( 




 I think I'll have to pull off a nighter today to participate in the thread. 




 Waiting patiently for the ACJ thread! 




 #BuyANexus 




 I love Asterix! 




 CC and /r/androidcirclejerk. 




 Books, reddit and animated movies. 




 I don't play games. I don't listen to music. 




 Cyanoshit



You have disgraced Lord DuARTe. 




 40C/104F here. 




 I will try to come! 




 What? Why do you want me to crush women? :O 




 Because it is designed by Lord DuARTe. 




 This movie looks too damn promising. 




 First time I have used it, I am going to watch the movie today after 6 years, so I was excited :P 




 what's up?

 'Cause I'm 16. 




 I like to drink water. 




 Only a few people hate it. It's actually very good, and that's the reason why it's the highest grossing animated movie. 









 I am getting super-excited for this one! 




 Also, how was the movie? Does it live up to the high expectations? 




 And using reddit is fun *is not fun.* 




 Buzz Lightyear? 




 It would be the monsoon season here, with rains, and that would make it gloomy :( 




 Summer's almost over here :( 




 I might rephrase the question. Why is he the biggest shill? 




 Why is /u/ladfrombrad literally Stalin? 




 My top comment is this:




I had put an AMA request for him on ACJ, I think he saw that...


Yup, pretty proud if it... 




 MKBHD. 




 Running, it always helps relieve stress. 




 Even I love animated movies and I am re-watching most of the animated movies I love! 




 I loved Tangled as well. The CGI is beautiful. 




 Monster's Inc. is very nice film. I just rewatched it yesterday. 




 The animation was perfect.  




 Up was a very touching movie... I loved it. 




 Yup. Wall-E is amazing. 




 Probably the most underrated Disney movie? 




 Yup, Tangled and Frozen were excellent as well, and Big Hero 6 is my all-time favourite. 




 16, M, No, No. 




 Also, when did I tell you I like Disney? I genuinely don't remember :)
