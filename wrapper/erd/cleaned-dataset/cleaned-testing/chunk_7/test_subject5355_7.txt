 You can't just see a doctor? What country do you live in?  




 "Oh it's that clown guy. He's a bit of a prick" 




 Can I suck your cock? 




 Playing video games makes you an artist now? Jesus christ 




 The full details are that he made it up 




 What? 









 Sea horses wouldn't be able to pull a ship of that size  




 The Internet can substitute for either gender 




 Or OP could try living on the edge a little and just pick one 




 Le fuck off 




 But I people weren't willing to do it, it would pay more. Why should I have to fork out extra money to pay someone when a high school drop out is willing to do it for minimum wage 




 They're specimens not 'piss jars'! 




 None of this applies to me except the video games. Am I safe or do they need to go to? 




 How do you make Bond feel insecure? 




 Trial by dank memes 




 We could have an entire AskReddit thread dedicated to Tommy Wiseau theories 




 Isn't there a theory that this is completely made up? 




 B-boom goes the uh... The d-dynamite 




 But the amiibos push the price up, right? So what's the difference? 




 All humans in FF7 have Cetra roots. The theory is they occupy the same universe. Potentially, 7s humans descended from 10s Cetra 




 This seems common in fiction. Did it actually occur much in real combat? 




 that sounds ok

No it fucking doesn't  




 Couldn't you simply not tell anyone and immediately go to claim it? 




 Two virgins talking about what constitutes good sex... 




 Cloud being a clone of Sephiroth is a bigger plot twist than the Aerith thing 




 A secret character would be data mines within a week of release 




 I think they must mean the people from Spira were the Cetra. FFVII humans lost a lot of their technology and innate magical ability once Jenova wiped out the Cetra 









 No, it's because the equipment we use to measure it interacts with the particles and effects it's behaviour 




 I always assumed it was prosthetics, but in the last episode of season 5 Arya keeps removing faces from a corpse as if they were just thin masks on their face. Is it magic or something? 




 But 'you can control three characters and mash x' is? Let's be real here, 99% of all Final Fantasy battles are just mashing X 




 The problem was the game was too easy. The battle system was fine at its core 




 Just change turn based to time based 




 Yikes 




 That's any genre though. 




 -carry around a bunch of boxes

This is fucking retarded 




 Maybe shirts should come with expiry dates 




 Found my car keys  




 A what? 




 To be with more attractive people intimately. How dysfunctional do you have to be to not understand the basic mating process? 




 This 




 Wrap a towel around your waist. They won't care 




 Do you ever think about how much dick your mum sucked in her lifetime? 




 Is it just broken atm or is it simply not an implemented feature and the data is a placeholder? 




 Is this data retroactive, or will it start fresh with source 2? Can't check as I'm holidaying 




 Picture a man, alone, browsing Reddit... 




 Best to 14th best then Cars 2 









 Simulators are notorious for being time sinks and addicting. No idea where you heard they were consider boring 




 But that has nothing to do with the argument. Of course there can be successful projects without crowd sourcing... The point is it brings things to market that otherwise wouldn't exist. It adds options for creative or ambitious people to raise the necessary funds to create things people will enjoy 




 Isn't that just standard German inflection? 




 His delivery sucks then  




 Isn't a plasma screen just glass? 




 How does that answer his question? I'm not saying it doesn't, I just don't understand it to be honest 




 If so, how does the whip achieve the actual grabbing? 




 Good luck mate 




 Crowd sourcing gives the ability for them to fail in the first place. Without it, games like Yooka Laylee and (I believe) FTL would never be given the chance to fail in the first place. The average person cannot raise the kinds of funds without some form of external investment.

Traditionally, this is capital markets or bank loans. Now we can add crowd sourcing to the list. 

It doesn't encourage laziness anymore than convincing some wealthy investors to give you money and squandering that. Either way you are ruining your own reputation and wasting resources provided externally. The encouragement to not be lazy is wealth.  




 When you form a company, you are often not the one investing either... This is why many company founders are often CEOs and not actual owners.

Crowd sourcing brings products to market that may not otherwise exist. They also do not require any given individual to bear a significant portion of the risk of the product/company as opposed to traditional investing. 




 Also, your notion of getting what you want by working hard isn't true of capital markets that already exist. Having a profitable idea gets you what you want, not working hard. Very few products available for purchase are self funded 




 It's just a form of investment.

Capital markets have allowed technology and the quality of life to explode. 

Crowd funding isn't much different. Except the potential return/reward is a new product on the market instead of dividends.

Games like Yooka Laylee would not likely exceed of it depended on investors from acapital market, since they're riskier than CoD 18.

It's a fine system that is currently a little too open to abuse. But certainly not 'lazy' 




 What the fuck? You can't count people? 




 Sooo... Read more carefully before shitposting 




 -pick up kids 
-meeting with leader of reptile overlords
-do laundry 




 How the fuck do they keep losing them? 




 How long do they typically have lunch for? What if no one is hungry? 




 Or maybe the kind of guy who is more excited to watch a movie then be with his date was not particularly exciting to go on a date with  




 And the movie was still decent regardless of what Kubrick wanted 




 Unfortunately? The sequel was fine  




 Why? He literally told us nothing about the girl  




 Jesus Christ, it's a few fucking dollars as some stupid features. You're absolutely spastic  




 How? 




 Fucking rubbish  




 It's meant to be inconspicuous... 




 More specifically? 




 "I'd like to put his... ass on" 




 Is the exact opposite of Kevin Spacey 




 I agree with you. The cringe for my is the disrespect for its value. You don't just carve up thousands of dollars for a joke  




 girls kissing and then getting down on eachother real candid lesbians - Pornhub.com
 




 I understand there may not currently be an answer yet, but just incase: does anyone know if Blofeld is not part of thee Craig films at all, or will he simply not be in this film (perhaps the sequel?)

 




 The controls were smooth has hell. He design decision to prevent motion and shooting is to add to the tebsion 




 First prequel? 




 There are three? 




 Because this joke has been posted so many times now it would look stale and outdated before this movie releases 




 It'll be better than the movie too 




 Iron Man and Batman have taken down foes faster and stronger than Luke, with more powerful 'magic' abilities  









 True 




 Or his ex will suck the massive cock of some rich investor while OP browses Reddit 




 Or it could keep track of the ones it picked 




 You walked right into that g 




 What an old post 









 No, use he because he was born with a dick and these degenerates need to fuck off and die. 




 Better than being dead 




 'High quality' 




 They only started that in X  




 Making a post on the Internet is taking something serious? 




 Ignoring the obvious stuff like outdated music.

For me - being able to take Cloud out of the party. It always felt odd to have him stuck in the group 




 You can in FFX by pressing triangle. 




 Is it a Mario platformer? 




 The issue here is yearly releases leading to saturation. Who gives a shit if it's a successor or not? 




 Right... And op is arguing that it shouldn't be that way. He knows this is the case. That's the point of his post. 

You have to justify the law as it is, not summarise it... 









 Actually, Qs role is to judge their worth and he DOES get into trouble for meddling with species. 




 This. Same for men really 














 Face definitely contributes to your worth, it's just not the sole factor. Take two otherwise equal people, but one is ugly, I'd rather hang around the pretty one 




 Did you lose any weight you fat fuck? Get some self control you piece of shit and stop eating so fucking much you cow. 




 Or he will lead a wealthy and privileged life and only pick fights with those he can beat up 




 Have you proved him wrong yet? 




 What movie? 




 'Mass' exodus. Lol 




 Old Bond? I haven't seen any Craig Bond movies, I thought he was meant to be young Bond? 




 Yes 




 Haha wp! 




 Literally WHO 




 Good job! 




 Nice on matey 




 Brilliant! 




 Haunts you? Would you say this story Hurts you?

Ps. I didn't read past your opening line 




 It still looks easy without those tbh 




 I'm sorry I missed this one 




 VIIIs draw system is rubbish  




 Seven is getting a remake, maybe he could wait for that 




 That makes no sense and would just leave you with three copies of FF3. you can probably get a refund on two of them  




 Not being professional isn't always a bad thing. It was a story about chocolate, get the stick out of your ass 




 Why? 




 You said PS4 is really just the PC. He responded to that 




 [Salad Fingers breathes creepily] 




 Balk? 




 Because if they put Halo on PC then the XBone dies 




 I think this is most likely just to get people who didn't play it the first time round. A little extra cash. 




 Kh3 is nearly completed? I thought it barely started development 




 Which has already existed since the 90s, and was recently rereleased on Steam with achievements and cloud saving... 




 Only have access to mobile and hunting content is annoying. Trying to browse official websites on my iPhone is annoying too 














 You can't tell me that the admins didn't know that that's exactly why users would aim to do 




 Ok 




 Time stamp for mobile users? 




 The answer would be all of the above and more, depending on the ruler in question 




 Just as unfunny as the real SNL 




 Dear God... 




 Studios wouldn't hire him? That's cold. Cold like ice. Which is what his character Mr. Freeze uses in the movie Batman and Robin. 




 Jimmy fallon's fake laugh... Jesus Christ 




 Or hired taller actors. 




 I definitely remember watching it one night when I was 6 




 Actually picturing this is fucking weird 




 Degenerate 




 Most of those examples aren't brigading and are no different from any sub designed at making fun of people (cringe, rage, fashion disaster subs, ugly people, etc).

The two that involves active FPH harassing cross sub are not enough to warrant an entire sub deletion or garner admin attention. I still don't think it's a convincing excuse for deleting the sub. 

On an unrelated note, that chick from progress pics has an absolutely disgusting body. 









 The reason they were banned is debatable. I was an avid FPH browser and I never once saw any meaningful attempt to harass people organised on the sub.  




 You're thinking of Marth (who Roy is a clone of). Roy has always been mid to low tier.

Considering how weak Marth is now either the gap will be bridged between the two, or Roy may adopt some of Marth's new disadvantages and be even weaker yet. It's unlikely this character will shine competitively unless they completely rework him 




 Yes I do lol! I want to lick his sticky globs of semen off his nob 




 I think her body is fine, but the dress makes her look... Lumpy 




 Nerves 




 To be fair, if they invest in enough servers to survive the current influx of users, but those users quickly grow bored and move back to Reddit, they will have wasted a ton of money 




 He likes plants 









 Can I sample some of your beats? 




 This guy thinks Transformers is high art
