 Welcome to the Corporatocracy! 




 You won't be able to turn off automatic updates in Win10, all you'll be able to do is schedule restarts.  
You can't be trusted to keep your PC secure so they'll do it for you, check out the Win10 preview and the talks last week from Ignite conference. 




 Free forever!1@!!#1!!1  
Being free forever will undoubtedly allow for adware/spyware and other 'tracking' happening behind the scenes whether you care about it or ignore it.  
OneDrive, Skype, the Store, the Camera app, and a handful of other things are un-installable (disable only lol) permanent back-doors.  
Not to mention the forcing of auto-updates, can only pick what ring you want to be on slow/fast and when to schedule reboots. They don't trust anyone, including sysadmins, to get the patches out so they'll do it for you, ya know for 'security'. 




 hahahahahaha

Finally, my dream of Flappy Bird on my PC without a browser!! /s 




 Ya, I read some more and you're right, you can't just load an apk.  




 Wonder if this means apps I've already bought on Google Play   extracted using Apk Extractor can then be loaded on a Win10 phone without having to buy them again thru the windows app store. I guess as long as they're not tied to google play services it should work.  
Then which apps would I want to run on my PC, hmm.

 You've got to be insane to smile in a photo, also people die at the fair. 




 Not sure why you're downvoted, although to be fair Nintendo does own a majority share of Game Freak. Those other 2 pay-to-play games and the recent Mii Plaza changes on the 3DS ($5 to upgrade the plaza and $5 for each of the ~5 non-free games, that ALL rely on Streetpass) isn't a good sign.  
Nintendo is learning from the big boys and it scares me. 




 Caution, mounting whales causes building collapse. 




 Go GOG.com! 




 Steam, where you are only renting the privilege to play a game cause you don't own shit in this digital DRM ridden era.

 It's the hair we deserve, but not the hair we need right now 




 That's what she said. 




 Really, they are bombing in their pre-launch alpha   beta phases now. After players get in and see the dull and lazy writing on the wall, they're gone (See TESO trying to entice its masses of beta-players to try live this weeked). They could care less about it 'only being alpha/beta', when we've seen time after time, promises of miracle patches and countless bugs reported but never fixed before launch, etc.
