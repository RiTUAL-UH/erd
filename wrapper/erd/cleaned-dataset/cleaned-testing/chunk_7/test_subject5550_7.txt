 If you hate gays so much why not join ISIS?

Where'd he say he hates gays? I don't 'hate' many convicted felons on death row, and in some cases, you can even understand what drove them to commit their crimes. That doesn't change that the law prescribes for them to be executed. Where exactly does 'hate' function in this or are you incapable of talking about something without your emotions boiling over?

EDIT: I just remembered we actually spoke before. You can't tell consenting adults what they can do behind closed doors. Also based on that mentality I'm sure Islam fits you like a glove. 

Are you okay with incestuous relationships? polygamous ones? necrophiliac ones? You can get consent in all of those cases (pre-mortem in the last case - assuming consent is even needed for engaging with something non-living). Where do you draw the lines with your vastly superior moral compass? 




 In Islam, it's acting on the impulse that's prohibited. Repressing a prohibited urge is considered a good deed. For instance, if a klepto walks into a store and walks out without stealing anything, that's a good deed in Islam. 




  I'm not entirely sure the point you're making here. Are you suggesting killing someone for acting on their desire is acceptable? 

The Shari' punishment for *Muslims* being caught having certain acts is capital punishment. These punishments are at the discretion of the ruler, and have historically rarely been applied. They're also rules that apply to Muslims - non-Muslims have their own laws under the Islamic governance framework (when Muslims occupied Zoroastrian territories, they didn't prohibit tithing Zoroastrian communities from engaging in incest in spite of their abhorrence of it).

As far as this particular issue, if somebody goes to a Shari court and confesses that they had male homosexual sex, and they are found as being mentally sane and honest, capital punishment is applied. This is the same as when people confess to adulterous relations while married (capital punishment is applied). Likewise, if they are caught by four reliable witnesses (so basically they were having sex in public), the punishment is the same.

If someone chooses to act on their desire, isn't it between that person and God?

No. Some things are between you and God since the law doesn't prescribe punishments for them (i.e. breaking your fast, not praying, etc.). Other acts on desires (extra-marital affairs, theft, murder, bestiality, necrophilia,  etc.) which do have punishments 'on the books' for them - would under an Islamic state have those punishments carried out. 




 Sadly, as with every other situation, the outcome is a forgone conclusion. It will be interesting to see how japanese average people react when all is said and done. 

Not necessarily. Many countries pay off hostage takers, especially for valuable hostages, through back-door channels. 




 I was wondering what the view of abortion was in Islam; whether its interpreted differently by scholars or is covered under the Q'ranic view that one should not kill others who have not provided reason to kill them.

You might be surprised to find that several of the early church fathers didn't share the modern Christian take on abortion being outright "murder" in all cases. Like with Islam, there were discussions on when ensoulment occurs (before which a fetus is not a human anymore than sperm are humans).

After the ensoulment period, Islam doesn't *generally* allow for abortion. 




 Imagine suffering for a year and losing your closest friends and family members. Along comes a group that takes revenge on your behalf and empowers you to defend your community. That's the perspective of a plenty of people in some of these towns. In one town, daish brought out Syrian soldiers and the community beat the soldiers to death. Daish didn't even have to do anything.

Do you remember what US troops did to Fallujah after American corpses were desecrated several years ago? They sent out letters telling families to leave (while making it exceptionally difficult to leave) and then effectively bombed parts of the city into nothing, with more than just your conventional weapons.

When you live in a bubble and haven't experienced what these people have experienced - it's hard to contextualize their actions objectively. For the record - I'm not justifying this sort of thing by Daish or by the US occupation, just pointing out 'how'/'why' people do these things. 




 Plenty - but on the flip, conversion rates spike after incidents like this. Most people are just angry - but plenty are more confused than they are angry. Many of these people want to understand the greater picture, and the context, and in turn - several end up becoming Muslim. It's a recurring theme in the West. And this sub plays a quantifiable role (if we take professions of faith on here seriously) in that direction. 




 Also. Couldnt they just get a sharper knife? Use a guillotine?

The knife is sharp. They are dead with the first blow, the second one / third ones are to guarantee it (in case you didn't watch the clip) 




 inna lillahi wa inna illayhi rajioon 




 The Qur'an was talking about epistemological ideas that were not explicitly developed until the Enlightenment over a thousand years before it.

Stuff like this, and many other reasons. 




 I'm only 21 so I don't think of death as always near

I've seen people die younger than 21. 




 So, the age of earth is 1/3 of the age of the universe.

You can't necessarily draw that conclusion. We don't know where overlaps take place or if each yawm is of the same length of time. 




 It's at the least compatible with modern theory afaik. The Qur'an explicitly states that the Earth and "the heavens" were once a part of a single unit:

Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? 

As for the Earth itself, its arrival at the present state took place in sittati ayyamin (6 periods) similar to the Bible I believe.

 Zionist pig is a term that can only be applied to jews, which is an ethnicity.

You can be a Zionist without being Jewish...in fact, plenty of white Christians in the US who aren't part of the tribe in any way self-identify as Zionist.... 




 Does everyone in this sub hate jews?

Because pointing out a fact as OP does is anti-semitism /s

OP is certainly a racist sack for sure, but it's pretty desperate on your part to lump a criticism of media's dubbing this group as some sort of champions of free speech as "hating Jews"... 




 No. It's not racist. As a matter of fact they are very anti-racist.

You must be retarded or American. Have you ever opened a copy? It's a racist rag...it kinda always has been... 




 It doesn't matter that Islam isn't a race. You can have a racist agenda and attack an abstraction (like religion) that particular races tend to affiliate with. This really shouldn't be a difficult concept to grasp... 




 This will probably sound like a good point to people in America - but anybody in France can tell you that the CH staff are bigots...CH was quite literally a racist rag...its when somebody was openly bigotted of Jews - (and not in a general way by lumping criticism of Judaism with other religions - with CH has done in the past, or criticism of Israel minimized by criticism of Palestinians - which CH has also done) - that CH had an issue.

It's like the Chef guy from South Park years ago. Had no trouble attacking anyone. But the moment South Park attacked Scientology - he was offended and quit.

And that's absolutely fine under the guise of free speech, you can attack many groups and hold a special position for a certain group. You have that right under this general abstract concept. It's the fact that their rag, because of the circumstances, is being championed for being champions of free speech, when really they're a fringe publication that makes use of free speech to attack (generally) disaffected minority populations. 




 I don't like to link to DailyStormer but responding to someone by attacking them versus the content of their message is pathetic, deflective and childish as fuck.

 When it comes to issues related to Islam, Muslims or Arab terrorists, sources like Breitbart/daily mail and other trash rags often make it to the top spot in /r/worldnews. It's rather depressing really - especially since I've seen the speech and the mayor quite literally *did not* say "fuck off" - these guys can't print shit without exaggeration or respinning. 




 Yep - the internet empowers global calamities to instantly become local. Anecdotal issues become the objective recurrent reality in many people's minds. 




 Only steers and queers come from Texas - more power to you as an out-of-the-closet Moslem. There needs to be more. 




 Clearly English comprehension isn't stressed on in Texas though. 




 Half of our country relies on Fox News to be informed citizens that take part in elections. 




 We have sky news, which isn't a million miles away. But we also have the daily mail, which is pretty much fox news in paper form.

I guess the difference is that Daily Mail is generally considered a tabloid rag - a huge chunk of people in the US literally use Fox News and other such outlets as their primary source of information. 




 Either that or the dog is just legitimately stupid. 




 I don't think that's what he was attempting a "they got what was coming" esque justification - but I can see why JPost and some others would want to reframe the discussion in that way. Every time somebody attempts to explain context to a situation, rather than just telling us to be angry and mentioning how horrific it was, we get in a tizzy. 




 What bias are they depicting? From the announcement email, they're simply asking staffers to dig at the root causes of these issues (if you read the announcement in full and not the re-contextualized excerpts highlighted in the article) - if anything, that's exactly what you want out of a news outlet providing you with a basis to make informed judgements vs 'OMG the Durka Durkas are killing us for cartoons - Muh Freedoms!' 




 I have no gold to give sir - have a shekl 




 Our mosques are segerated. My halal butcher is in Bellerose, Queens and serves me last even if I arrive first. The closest mosque to me refers to me as "abeed." If I go to Friday prayer at the mosque near me, people don't pray next to me and they switch into their language when talking around me. 

And you're 100% sure this is because of your skin color? It couldn't possibly have anything whatsoever to do with the values you espouse? Which you vocalized at least on Reddit - and I'm sure you've vocalized at these different places? Not to dismiss your experience - I just want to know if it isn't conflation and re-contextualization..

I've been to mainstream mosques in 4 states and 3 countries, and never once experienced anything like what you're talking about. Maybe NYC is just a cess pool... 




  Many black Muslims first found Islam through the NOI so Farrakhan deserves a bit of thanks for just getting islam out there.

Plenty of people in the US found Islam 'because of' 9/11. Good things can often come from bad things, you don't go around praising/thanking the orchestrator of something that isn't good. 




  NOI is not black supremacist actually. They view all Afro-Asiatic people as the same.

So it's an Afro-Asiatic supremacist organization disguised as a religion. 




 17 isn't pedophilia.

In UK, underage laws are at 16... 




 I don't know about /r/worldnews, but that is quite literally the exact response I've gotten from someone. When somebody on the fringe does something 'bad', he's a true representative of the religion. When somebody does something 'good', he represents only himself and is one of the rare handful of 'good' people that believe in Islam:

Be better at bullshitting. Look, I am the most consistently anti-Islamic poster in this sub by a longshot, and yet even I am happy to acknowledge Muslims whose conduct warrants praise. The "fringe elements" are, in fact, representative of Islam generally. But, even as toxic as the religion generally may be, its sheer size means that there have always been and will always been individuals who self-identify as Muslims who are still excellent people. The man in question is one such example. So I am happy to praise him, but with the understanding that he is a credit to himself, not some typical representative of his religion. But by all means, keep straw manning the position of those of us who are critical of Islam. 




 Charlie Hebdo weren't killing in the name of freedom of speech.. They weren't violent.. 

But they *were* an extremist fringe. Nobody said they were violent, but their vitriol wasn't representative of French thought as a generality or as a majority. The same applies to the men who killed them. The comment by the AJ staff member isn't about violence, but the values espoused by the two groups. 




 Oh no -- something that shatters the view of Muslims as a monolith characterized by the fringe elements of the group. 




 You didn't get it because you were the butt of the joke. 




  I was laughing hard throughout but find it hard to imagine people got the references through out it.

He was having a go at another comedian ;) 




 I'm actually not a bigot. But I've learned how to reap the benefits of the bigotted karma train on reddit. Say something objectively true in a coherent manner followed by a disgusting bigoted comment in the guise of rational analysis - and notice how the obvious bigotry won't even be registered by most people. It won't be registered because most of the people reading and upvoting the absurdity I posted are imbeciles of r/worldnews and view groups they classify as the 'other' as monolithic entities. 




 has claimed them too,

No - 2 individuals (Cohen and somebody else) have claimed that those groups have claimed them, in contradicting narratives. The story grows more implausible. 




 It's okay - it happened years ago and it's not the same thing as killing a bunch of bigoted cartoonists so it won't get the world riled up. /s 




 Not only that. It might also never have happened.
There is literally no follow-up to be found on the internet that supports that this story is true.

In your exhaustive 0 minutes of research you were unable to find any corroboration and therefore the story should be just dismissed. Alrighty. I was alive when that happened - I remember hearing about it when it happened and it was covered extensively - nice minimization and dismissal of other people's suffering though.

How about actually looking into stuff before making bullshit speculations? 




 Most of this sub is that sub-set of Sunnis that use Reddit. Make of it what you will.

 Rule 30. 




 Maybe they'll start blowing each other up for a change.

For a change? In Syria, rebel groups fight each other more than they fight the Syrian government that they originally set out to depose. And even as a general rule, the victims of these terrorist groups are by large majority, other Muslims. 




 My question is why is it even offensive to make fun of your religion.

Go around Comptom in klan gear yelling "Niggers are monkies", and then when you're getting your ass beat, explain that it meant nothing to you and you were just having a laugh.

Islam is something that a lot of people identify with, it's something they associate with their families, their ancestors, their friends, and themselves. You can't expect to make fun of something - that is the most important something for many people - and expect a handful of them to be a little less willing to play by the rules of their country. Especially in a place like France where most of these Muslims are a marginalized minority growing up in the ghetto.

On top of that I don't imagine all powerful God needs you to defend his honor.

God doesn't need anything from you in Islam. You don't pray because praying keeps God alive, you pray for yourself.

I don't think these criminals were thinking "well in God's moment of weakness, I'll go defend him". You're coming from a very transactional, need/desire fulfillment based culture I imagine so you're conflating it with mindset of people like this, but that sort of recontextualization won't help you understand what happened imo. 




 They knew they were being provocative and have faced threats in the past, I'm quite frankly a bit surprised that everyone is so surprised about it. And I don't understand how they didn't have stronger security precautions in place.

Right? If you're going to make a living on the overtly bigoted notions of a small percentage of the national population - you've got to have at some point considered that your exercise of free speech might not be well received everywhere. Imagine somebody walking through a ghetto in the states in full klan gear yelling 'niggers are stupid'. Free speech and all, but you know what you're doing isn't gonna get you kisses and hugs.

That doesn't make what those guys did right, but everyone that exercises speech that is inflammatory makes a calculated risk. And the same people crying foul about this horrendous incident were nowhere to be seen when George Galloway was getting assaulted by a Jewish guy, or when European revisionist historians were being interred as state policy in many places. 




 Well the ritual was annual for the Maya - I'm sure you can find sources on that. And I don't think they sacrificed entire villages at a time, but no, I can't back up the '1' figure that I posed with a 'like' and '?' to suggest I'm not making an overt claim since I don't honestly know. 




 Why else would he just run into them like that?

If he was one of the hostages. 




 Yea - that whole "the hostages died before we came in" isn't seeming super believable. These guys were almost as trigger happy as [Florida police](http://therundownlive.com/florida-cops-fire-nearly-400-rounds-killing-2-injuring-2-police/) 




 Worked in Pakistan after the school shooting - might work in France too, hope we don't drift into barbarity because of anecdotal events... 




 
Dunno if it's a sin, but questioning aspects [of the holocaust narrative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial) is certainly illegal in plenty of countries. Including in France. 




 Forget hate speech against Jews, how many of these same "Western liberals" raised an outcry over the consistent imprisonment of revisionist **historians**. Not bigoted cartoonists - historians. How many of these same "Western liberals" came to the defense of MP George Galloway when he was physically assaulted for his freedom of expression?

How many of these same "Western liberals" are defending the hate preacher Abu Hamza al Misri that just got sentenced on trumped up charges today - charges we know are trumped up given that our government has a policy of torturing terror suspects in custody (now undeniable) and UK was unable to even bring the same case to court with the same evidence for the last 10+ years - because they knew they didn't have a case. Raid after raid, arrest after arrest, they found they couldn't build the case. As soon as the chap gets extradited to the good ol' US of A - suddenly there's a bullet-proof case against him justifying perpetual imprisonment in effectively solitary confinement. 




 They sacrificed - what - like 1 kid a year? How many kids die on average each day for the freedom and democracy abstraction? 




 the fuck is silktricky.com 




 You think people move to "the West" for the freedom?

This. My ancestors moved because they were bound by chains and told they had to pick cotton and live in American style perpetual slavery - because we were the unlucky descendents of Cain that happened to get caught. 




 The whole idealogy of Hinduism is based on non-violence.

 It's not about it being popular, it's about ensuring that your opponents make their political dialogue anti-Islamic. That rhetoric will guarantee your Muslim base even if they disagree with you politically or on topics like this.

As far as people having open support for this in some cultures, its not hard to imagine - people kill each other over politics, momma jokes, and other 'petty shit' all the time. 




 Out of the woodwork? This is a prominent individual in India, and he's cleverly manipulating the discourse to benefit from polling - nobody's crawling out of any woodwork, it's a well calculated political move. 




 Those Muslims are just doing exactly what they are supposed to do. Kill White men and fuck White women (notice the girlfriend of one of the attackers is White). How else do you think they will destroy Europe? Growing up in what is now a Muslim area, we were attacked all the time by Muslims and Blacks in order to isolate us and get White women (who they treat like whores). When Muslims go to a club where there are lots of pretty White women, they will start fights in order to make the White men leave so they can prey on the White women. It is Sexual Jihad. It works very well and many societies have been conquered and destroyed using this as well as other techniques. Countries which were Buddhist, Christian, Pagan or Hindu before are now majority Muslim because of these techniques.

It worked in my home. Eventually, we had to leave my neighborhood. There were just too many of them.

 You can tell the poor chap is falling head-first into an existential crisis. 














 I'm going to take a swing and guess "proletariat" is not Reddit's core user base. Apparently your average city cop isn't "working class" according to these clowns. 

You can be working class and still be aligned against your own interests, the same way you can be black and vote against your own social interests, or be a poor Christian and vote against your own economic interests. There were Jews in the gestapo...your criticism of their use of the term isn't very well-reasoned. 




 He didn't say "just".... 




 Absolutely, police are always re-educating those silly serfs trying to go 10 over the limit and parking a few minutes over their metered time. "millions of times a day" to give out "countless different" infractions to help direct the course of civilization and most definitely not to generate revenue. 




 So the bukket is a grower not a shower - very impressed never-the-less 




 I would share with a neighbor--Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Athiest, or alien--without a second thought about it, simply because watching someone else suffer would cause me suffering. We are all HUMAN.

What if he wasn't suffering (as the individual in the OP)? What if he appeared to live more lavishly than you even and seemed like a complete asshole. Does simple innate humanism drive you to go share your meal with him then? Or does being 'HUMAN' generate envy, possibly dislike, in that particular case?

Empathy doesn't drive you to do acts of kindness, it only allows to you notice when somebody is in a state that you wouldn't like to be in and you are naturally moved to move them from that state. And even that only if you *happen to* to observe an individual distressed with your own eyes (or hear about it). What OP is suggesting is an unprovoked kindness, one that isn't driven by simple empathy... 




 I wonder if he thinks it's equally absurd to believe that the universe and everything in it was created for us alone by a being who we cannot hear, see, touch, taste, or smell

Is it as absurd as the idea of multiverses that by definition exist such that we cannot hear, see, touch, taste or smell them?

 




 Livin the American dream 




 Ahhhhh... thank you kind sir - have an upvote - I've been googling for about 20 minutes and racking my brain - leave no joke unturned as they say. 




 Hey there

I don't know what exactly you're looking for, but here's a Google search of a pretty useful English Academic Islamic website on the topic of Moses

https://www.google.com/search?q=moses btnG=Search domains=www.islamic-awareness.org sitesearch=www.islamic-awareness.org

As far as the Biblical and Islamic accounts, they aren't exactly identical - and the Islamic account is nowhere near as detailed with specifics. The Qur'an has a very limited focus on stories and the idea is that the past stories included in the Qur'an were mentioned because of direct benefit to be drawn from them. So coming from a Christian background, when you read an exclusively Islamic account of - say Moses - it'll feel like a Sparknotes version. Islamic texts neither confirm, nor deny, many aspects of these older stories - or the talmudic/church interpretations of them.

If you look up tafseer (interpretation) of Qur'an, you'll note that scholars will often use what Muslims call 'Israeliyyat' (stories of the Tribe of Israel) that Muslims inherited from Christians and Jews to supplement the information explicitly found in Muslim sources (Qur'an and hadith). And the Muslim treatment of these stories is:

(a) if a detail is confirmed in the Qur'an/Ahadith, then the preceding detail is accepted as true.
(b) if the detail is contradicted by Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Islamic narrative trumps preceding narrative.
(c) if the detail has no testimony whatsoever in Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Muslim stance is neither to accept nor reject it's veracity.

This might be especially useful to you however since Israeliyyat aren't necessarily just what you find in tanakh or even mishnah, or presently existing non-canonical texts. In this sense, the Muslim scholars retained some pieces of information that aren't presently available anywhere else. So if you have access to a library with a volume of an English translation of tarikh at-Tabari (History [of the World] by al-Tabari), then you'll have an even greater volume of information on Moses stories that were known as late as about 800 AD (but the veracity of which can't be established without further research of course).

All that said - the story of Moses is actually pretty big in the Qur'an - I think Moses is actually mentioned by name more times than Muhammad himself in fact. Different details about Moses are found in different parts of the Qur'an since it isn't a book in the traditional sense, but a good place to start is [Surah 28](http://quran.com/28). If you want to get more in depth, an abridged translation of Tafsir ibn Kathir (an interpretation by Ibn Kathir) can be found [here](http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content task=category id=99 Itemid=84).

Hope you find what you're looking for - best of luck! 




 I was just explaining the theological reasoning behind why the word 'revert' is used by Muslims. It's a presumption based on Islamic theology - all created souls are created cognizant of their creator (even before you acquire self-awareness as a child a few years later).

By comparison - you have Christians who baptize children before any reasonable consent is physically possible. To these groups, the child is 'Christian' before he can say 'Christ'. The only differences are that Islam forgoes baptism and considers all children as being born Muslim, and the concept of original sin never actually comes into play in Islam since children are inherently sinless in the religion. 




 Allahu Akbar = God is Great. Takbir is what you say to ellict that (the word to describe the saying).

I imagine you want to throw together a micro-brew and market it through controversy. As far as calling your drink "Takbeer" - you won't get far imo. 




 Explicit tahreem of cannibalism is not in the Qur'an either. Hell, you won't even find a saheeh hadith prohibiting cannibalism. The Qur'an only has give or take 500 legal verses, with repetition - and the law is a lot more expansive than that. Just 2 cents. 




 In Islam, its considered reversion because in Islam the natural state of a human being is that of a sinless Muslim. So for Muslims, Churchill, like all people, was born a Muslim but was taught something outside of his nature by his family, etc.

 I've consulted someone who has spent all their college years specializing in the Arabic language and it seems that, according to them, the word for interest would be "faedah" vs "Reba" or "Banhith" (usury). 

Faedah simply means benefit in Arabic. Riba literally means 'increase' in Arabic. It's not a direct translation to usury so even the post-Henry definition of usury that negates smaller interest isn't applicable to the literal definition of the word.

The definition of a religious term also isn't simply by linguistics (which is sufficient here imo) but by how the term was defined in tradition. I can put together a small book with the number of traditions on rib'a. In context of all of those, every money earned on money lending is riba - no distinction is clearly made between small and large amounts. To be specific, there are traditions which explicitly discourage even accepting paltry gifts - even 'a rope of straw' - from people when they repay your principle due.

In particular, if you look at the history of the cancellation of riba, the Prophet instructed his followers to pay back their principle and not pay a dime of the riba (that was owed to the money lenders). If the intention was that small amounts of riba were okay, than he wouldn't have allowed his followers to forego paying *anything* over the principle to the creditors of ta'if and elsewhere.

Citing commerce as a normal means of making money, including charging "reasonable" interest rates on loans, etc.

That's not the obvious reading of the ayah and I've never heard of any mufassir of repute suggesting what you're implying here. The people who used to take usury said "this is just business" (like non-usurious business). It's not suggesting that business/commerce is loans - the usury takers compared it to investments/risks associated with trade. 




 General consensus among Shia scholars is that tattoos are allowed. Many believe that to be a weak hadith.

There is ijma amongst Usooli Ithna Ashari's on tatoos?? Do you have any actual proof? 




 People are not hermaphrodites, they are intersex. I hate this bigoted sub sometimes.

Out of curiosity - how is that bigoted? Is hermaphrodite not an accepted term anymore? 




 The ruling for hermaphrodites was classically that they don't marry either gender (and we've had surgery available to hermaphrodites since ancient times). You'd want to reach out to a scholar, but I'd imagine that given the rule for hermaphrodites doesn't change in spite of surgery - the ruling of a transgendered person also would be similar. 




  Correction they do remove something. But you are still rude for trying to validate "what a real woman is". There are plenty of people who are legally a woman but we're not born with a uterus or ovaries. Or what about women who have to have them removed due to various medical reasons? Are they not "real women" anymore.

The point would've been that there are 'real women' - in that there people who are naturally born with female genitals and aren't hermaphrodites. One day - they might have an accident and some parts of their body may have to be removed - this doesn't change that they were naturally born women. Because they are 'real women', the rules and suggestions associated with women still apply to them (in general) and only rules specifically related to their (now missing) parts become void. 

For instance, would you be just as offended if I said that a child born without legs isn't a real biped? Humans - in general - are. But by definition, he isn't. Even if he later has surgery and receives working mechanical legs. He doesn't become a 'real biped' or naturally born a 'biped'. The reason this is important from the Islamic perspective is that - as with gender - some rules and suggestions apply to people based on their physical attributes. Somebody born without legs isn't required to do things like wash their feet during wudhu for their prayers. Let's suppose they have new mechanical limbs - the rule for them doesn't change all of a sudden.

So it is a technical issue and I highly doubt the intent was to offend.

That's neither here nor there - rules in Islam are secondary to the main point of Islam: tawheed (accepting the Oneness of God). Everything else, like following rules even if they are seemingly inconvenient for you, is just a physical manifestation of accepting what God is and what our roles are.

Either way I may some day have female private parts and identify as a woman. *edit still not sure if I will have Srs. It's a big decision regardless of morality.

I don't know you - and I have no idea what you're going through so I am not really in a place to say what you should and should not do. As you know though, going through with what you're considering is an irreversible change. And as someone who cares - regardless of your religious persuasion or decision regarding this issue, I would encourage reading *everything* you possibly can on the issue from all sides - moreso what medical professionals say on the topic through study than what some politically motivated organizations might say.

One of the foremost medical institutions in our country (Johns Hopkins) stopped using surgery as a treatment for GID. And in spite of the direction that political correctness is taking us, [full length studies](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016885) suggest that this treatment isn't working. To TL;DR some of the most problematic study findings:

(a) An incidence of suicide 20x that of the naturally organed population - suggesting that our solution of surgery is not working to treat GID.

(b) A finding that the majority of people who underwent surgery (of a sample) still had psycho-social adjusments that had not improved (from pre-surgery) - again, suggests that our solution is not working.

(c) Another study on non-trans people who felt they were naturally incorrectly assigned a gender - that 80% spontaneously lost this sense of improper identity over the course of time.

But regardless of what decision you make, just make sure its well-thought out and researched. Wishing you the best. 




 What you're missing is that most cases in the gay population are among blacks. So they end up stigmatizing all gay men because they wouldn't dare single out blacks in the same manner. 

Source? 




  There are also gay blacks so how does that get counted?

Well inmates can't really donate blood anyways. 




 I don't know a wife per say, but I know plenty of people openly in non-monogomous relationships where I live. 




 Quran arabic corpus also translates Ribaa as usury, and usury is charging 'excessive' interest. 

That's the post-King Henry-ish defintion of usury for English-people. You won't have a one-to-one translation of all Arabic words to their similar English ones. Ribaa means 'interest' - full stop - not just 'excessive interest' and the proof is in the traditions dealing with it.

Imagine if we started saying that the prohibition on pre-marital sex, and alcohol is just on doing it too much? What's left of the religious prohibitions at that point? 




 That's what I was thinking. He seems a little...off 




 Being anything is not a sin. But voluntarily removing a working member from your body *is* a sin in Islam, and castration in particular *is* explicitly prohibited. That said - it was something OP would've done before Islam. 




 That's a literal instruction about literal things - even if the expression "one of its wings" isn't literal. If a fly falls in your drink, you're suppose to dunk it. Have you ever thought about why flies are able to do just fine even though they land in feces and what-not all the time? They have anti-bacterial agents that counteract the 'poisons' their bodies pick up. You dunk the fly in the drink a few times and now in addition to the poisons it added by landing in your drink, it gave you the antibacterial agents from within and without it.

The tradition you're comparing to this about Hell's effects on weathers (or fevers) has nothing in common with it. The tradition you opened this thread with is talking about something that isn't known to exist in our universe (Hell) having an effect on something in our universe. That isn't testable. That's the same as saying the angel Izrael takes life vs saying cancer/car accident takes your life. Not testable, not empirical - and neither tradition contradicts our empirical knowledge because its not a statement about an interaction between two things that exist **here**.

If you had a tradition of the Prophet saying that a certain crater on Mars is the reason we have extreme heat and wind, you can test that. It's a statement about something **in this universe** having an effect on something else **in this universe**. It would necessarily be empirically observable and if it wasn't, we'd have an issue. 




 You have an institution which keeps telling us "there are bad apples, but our cops in general are good." Yet it explicitly chooses *not to purge itself*. It has a culture of discrimination that is demonstrably not anecdotal. And you have unions that protect and legitimize bad behavior by protecting the supposedly "rare" "handful" of "bad cops". Its intimate relationship with the judicial branch specifically allows wanton abuse.

I'm sorry - the good cop / bad cop narrative just isn't going to fly if as an organization, the NYPD (like many other departments) does literally nothing to single out and remove the bad apples from the orchard. That excuse works for racial/religious/ethnic groups with disparate elements. Not a fuckin organization. 




 [It's not.](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/)

- He's illiterate.
- He recites verses on the spot relating to issues as they pop up .... that he doesn't have the literary background to form ... and which in turn weren't imitable by his contemporaries ... 




 When you say fulan died, we say Izrael took his soul (i.e. why he died). That doesn't diminish from the empirical reason why he died (cancer, car accident, etc.) - I don't see why this hadith is problematic w/ respect to the empirical causes of extreme heat/cold.

How is it explained?

The same way ahadith about fever being from Hell are explained. [Extreme heat and extreme cold in the world are a taste of the punishment you (could) get in the afterlife.](http://audio-islam.com/2012/07/07/the-heat-of-the-summer-is-a-reminder-of-the-hellfire-shaikh-abdur-razzaq-ibn-abdul-muhsin-al-abbaad-mp3-areng/)
