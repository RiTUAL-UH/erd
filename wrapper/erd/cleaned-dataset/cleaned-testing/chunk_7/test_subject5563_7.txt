 Don't apartments usually offer a parking space that's included in the rent? 




 and learn Japanese as well! 




 Yeah I was wondering the same thing here, guess the magic of Hollywood is at work again! 




 umm here in Australia you pump your own fuel into a car. 




 I would actually love if Louis CK was in the actual movie as an android. No one would suspect him.  




 [Chris Harris driving the Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzqNn8kJqQ)  




 With Inception the entire opening drools with bond-esque moments. From Leo wearing a tux and holding a silenced pistol to the entire set piece itself.  




 Ah yes Denise Richards playing the most convincing nuclear physicist.  




 It's better that FOX focus on the Prometheus sequel and then once it is done they should take a look at a potential Alien 5. At least that way whatever we learn about the xenos in Prometheus 2 is carried over without any real continuity errors.  




 I love this, very Blade Runner-esque. 




 [Deux Ex Universe is NOT an MMO](http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/deus-ex-universe-is-not-an-mmo) 




 I think this will really be the full vision of a DX game they hoped to achieve with DX:HR but because of budget and time constraints they couldn't do it. However the sheer fact that DX:HR is still an awesome game with quite a bit of content cut shows off how amazing a fully realised vision would be from Eidos Montreal.  









 Hard to say, you are condensing a 10 hour game experience into a 2 hour movie (maybe 2.5hrs max). I'm a huge fan of the series however I think it would be pretty difficult to work into a film purely because of how the story is written around the game. Not to mention the odd characters that pop up in the film which would confuse the fuck out of focus testers and the studio. I think the best way to do it is to write the film around the story and not the game if you get what I mean.  




 Superb work mate! This looks extremely professional and could fool a lot of people haha. Do you work in animation/vfx etc? 









 Curious as to why everyone hates him? 




 Not surprised at all. I think EA knows that making it exclusive to PC   Xbox really hurt their sales expectations for the game. I don't think they bet on the PS4 beating Xbox One in sales.  




 This is going to sound so fucking stupid but after watching Speed Racer, I would love to see a film based on the video game series, Wipeout. 




 I'm Australian as well but they have pretty much relaxed what food you can bring in since the consumer watchdog had a go at them for banning outsidefood and overcharging for their own food. 




 I actually really enjoyed the 2010 film with Liam Neeson etc. Was surprised that they haven't made another one, did it bomb in the box office? The chemistry between the main characters was great, seems like a missed opportunity to not make another one in my opinion.  




 Yeah I heard the same as well, at least we know it will look and sound good. e.g Only God Forgives.  




 Ah yes, this guy uploads the most beautiful night drives. Grab some headphones, put whatever music you want and just turn the lights off and watch, simply amazing.  




 Not exactly sure if it's electro/synth, feel free to correct me. Also here is the original, [Non Remixed Version ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKjtqJ-VO38), both are beautiful tunes in my opinion.  









 Ah yes I am glad I wasn't the only one who got a cyberpunk vibe from the music. The film looks really interesting as well, although I heard it did pretty bad in festivals it will be cool to see what the film is about at least. If anything it will look good and have a killer soundtrack!

EDIT: The [Symmetry Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Rk-pLgtYE) is also awesome.  




 Thanks for the link, such a beautiful track! 




 Pretty much my experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition. It almost feels too easy.  




 My absolute favourite is the GITS Stand Alone Complex [Helicopter scene](http://youtu.be/xyDki4KhGhw?t=14s). So fucking good, the music and visuals are perfect.  




 The [GTA IV Reveal Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80K51DosFo) also made good use of it. 




 Well he's actually in pre production on [Hacksaw Ridge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1) which he is directing, starring Andrew Garfield. 




 Yep, from Australia, although all the posters etc in the cinemas said Fast and Furious 6. The same thing happened with Fast 5, was called Fast and Furious 5 on the posters etc and then Fast 5 in the opening credits.  




 Here's a wiki page on the [Blue Brain Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project) which according to the wiki is "an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. The aim of the project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles." 




 Fast and Furious 6 was called Furious 6, i'm pretty sure. When I load up my Blu Ray it says Furious 6 in the opening credits.  




 It's CG, as for the brief scenes of it looking damaged when it lands they probably used kit cars made to look identical to the real thing since destroying 1 of 7 cars only in the world just for a film would be a terrible and stupid thing to do.  




 So in JP lore was InGen publicly blamed for the events of San Diego in The Lost World? I ask this because in this video it states that Masrani bought InGen and are still using their name. Wouldn't the public be totally suss on that or do they not know that InGen actually created the dinosaurs? 




 Does anyone here feel that superhero films in the future will feel genre fatigue and start to see less superhero films being released on a yearly schedule? I feel that there are three big video game based films that could have the opportunity to be the equivalent of the the first breakthrough superhero film (e.g Spiderman, X-Men). 

1. Assassins Creed (2016) So this is being filmed right now with Ubisoft having very close creative control on the story of the film. This is a pretty huge franchise which has the potential to earn big bucks at the box office, although the franchise has had a bad rep with gamers due to the last release, Assassins Creed Unity which was released in an unfinished state with an unsatisfying story. This one could go hit or miss in my opinion.

2) Warcraft (2016) This is a big one. Duncan Jones directing the Blizzard made franchise. Warcraft is already a huge name because of the online only game, World of Warcraft. It's a billion dollar franchise played by tens of millions of players around the world. The early footage shown to those lucky people at Blizzcon have had people excited, Blizzard have worked very closely with the story for this game so this one could be a massive hit and break the video game stigma.

3) The Last of Us (20XX) This game was personally my game of last generation. It told a beautifully crafted story between a young girl named Ellie and a much older survivor named Joel, set 20 years in the future after a terrible fungal outbreak which causes people to turn into running fungi mutated versions of themselves, making themselves crazy. This is the best game to show off a mature story and extremely well written characters which are both complex and interesting. My personal take is if this is adapted correctly, it could be a serious contender for it to be an award winner.

Edit: spelling 




 Nice I had heard some of Chrome Sparks stuff before and really dug it :) Liking Phantogram as well, cheers for the suggestions!
 




 Yep I have Zaba on spotifiy, love it! I'll check out Odesza as well :) 









 Still my favourite [rave video from 97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMT3bRJXOo), everyone in the video is just off their tits.  




 Can cheaper drones get this kind of altitude? 




 Nice lighting and colour, where was this taken? 




 I would actually like to see him do that "impossible job" that was mentioned during the film.  




 So basically guys what features do you think GT7 should have to blow everyone away with the PS4 tech behind it? We have already seen amazing weather and visuals in Driveclub however that runs at 30FPS which is counter to what Polyphony run GT5/6 at. I imagine the cars will probably have a much deeper level of detail, however I hope they drop standard cars all together and run with premiums.  




 What happened? 




 What was the reasoning for the disallowing of that goal? 




 12x18 is perfectly fine mate, no rush :) 




 Feel the same way! When I get a new TV soon i'll definitely re-buy it in 3D. 




 Thanks mate, appreciate it! Saves me a lot of money as shipping the prints from Etsy to Australia is $15 on top of the print itself! 




 Hey do you think you could make a print for the Japan, Australia, Britain and Belgium? I know it seems a lot but if there's an easy way to do it myself I am more than happy to! 




 Would people here agree that the years for when the writers strike happened would have been pretty bad? 2008 to mid 2009? 




 Personal favourite is Recognizer by Daft Punk when [Sam Flynn first enters the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6V69KaG4a8) 




 Here you go mate :) [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8OZpmIWcxg), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfrHk6xdJMw) 




 Fucking loved this movie, and loved this scene especially. The music and cinematography are sublime. Was anyone else reminded of Hotline Miami in this scene?  




 I still haven't been blown away by a car chase like this in any other film. Sure there have been many great car chases since this one but none have managed to be as unique as this one in my opinion. Just such fantastic use of slow-mo as well as cars flipping over. Not to mention they built their own stretch of highway just for this scene. 

EDIT: Chase starts here [3:32](http://youtu.be/pHAm-zcXie4?t=3m32s) 









 Haha yeah, Byron is in NSW. I've should do a drive up there sometime, it looks really scenic.  




 So was this a right hand drive La Ferrari?  




 Special Operations, sounds rather mysterious which also makes me wonder why James Bond has never driven a Mclaren? 




 Judging by the Byron Bay canopy in the top right, I would say the state of NSW in Australia, however I have never seen a NSW plate that looks like this.  




 but you must not touch  




 I enjoy Michael Mann's lighting and digital camera use, I look forward to Blackhat even though it hasn't gotten the best feedback.  




 I find Driveclub pretty relaxing, just go on a time trial with it on fast time lapse and drive a point to point. Not trying to beat a fast time but just driving how you want.  




 Anyone know if it has fixed the Mantle load times for AMD users? 




 What does that mean? I can't see their comments? 









 They probably overhyped it because Gearbox showed off a completely different game... 




 One can dream, can they not? 




 Has there been any word on the what regions it will be available? You would hope that Sony would let people around the world watch it instead of it just being on the US store. 




 The CG has not aged well :/ 




 The BMW FW26 aka [Walrus Nose](http://www.carwallpapers.hu/check.php?im=BMW/WilliamsF1_FW26_A/2004_BMW_WilliamsF1_FW26_A_010.jpg) will alwas have a special place in my heart.  




 The ones posted on neogaf were posted by me... 




 Bonus [Bentley in the snow!](http://i.imgur.com/KTbNSkW.jpg) 




 Thanks mate! 




 It's a shame the G27 isn't supported :( 




 Change the shutter speed. If it's /8000 it will make the car appear still. The lower you go the faster it will make the car appear to be moving.  




 Thanks man :) Glad you liked them! 




 Making split screen is actually a pretty difficult process. You essentially have to render what's on screen twice and also do a lot of bug checking. So if split-screen were there in DC it would look pretty bad compared to full screen single player. The manpower required to make split-screen is not worth the effort considering how many people actually use it.  




 I think it's Wild Turkey and coke 




 You need a usb that's formatted as FAT 32. When you take a screenshot on the PS4 you can just transfer it to your usb by navigating to the "captured video/images section", from there you can view all your games and select which images/video you want to copy to your usb :) 









 Really? I thought that was a great scene, showed how disassociated these characters had become when it came to females.  









 Nice you must have gotten a dope as fuck ATAR to be doing undergrad med :) Good luck, my family are all doctors so it's hard work haha 




 Damn MK looks amazing in 60 fps.  




 Still upset about Tron Uprising :( 




 Hadn't heard this tune before this episode but I had a hunch that it was Moby! 




 Ah this video, was there ever any follow up on why he went apeshit at the end? 




 Has a different tone to their previous album but I am really loving this song. 




 What kind of limo do you drive? 




 If it's 60 FPS with fast load times and all DLC, then yes. I never got to experience ME1 and only played ME3 once without any of the DLC. So yes, if the bugs and other gameplay issues are fixed it would defintely be a buy for me.  




 You mean Otm Shank right? 




 When I first saw this film I didn't really enjoy it at all to be honest, but upon the second viewing I actually did end up enjoying it quite a bit. It's not a perfect film but I really love how it's shot and how it portrays the drug game. Plus the music in this movie, well all of Mann's films is amazing.  




 Yeah to be fair Michael Mann does a lot of research when he is making his films, Heat was the first film I had seen where it used proper gun handling techniques and unaltered sound. The guy goes real deep into getting things as realistic as possible.  









 He played Azog in The Hobbit iirc 




 Looks like South Korea will be attempting to do something kind of similar in the future with [8 City](http://travel.cnn.com/korea-8city-tourism-hub-incheon-789461). 




 He confused the shit out of me with the Fight Club blu ray, it loads the menu for some crappy Drew Barrymore rom com and then it slowly starts to artifact and break down into the fight club menu, pretty cool actually.  




 Hugh Jackman in prisoners is when he most looks like Joel.  




 I've only been here a few minutes, what's going on? 









 What? No! 




 Seriously if people are still hesitant about watching this show, don't be. This was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time. Especially given that it's a show on CBS, this is not too common. The first 2 seasons may be a bit hard to get into as it is procedural for the most part but once it gets firmly into it's serial nature it will become one of your favourite shows most likely. Easily a must watch.

 **LOVE**  the [Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA) teaser. I still enjoyed the sequels in their own way compared to the first one and this teaser brought the hype. Not only did you get a glimpse of the second film but at the end the teaser you learn that it will be concluded in a third film to be released the same year.  




 I would say the years that John Carter and Lone Ranger were released might have hurt them that year.  




 Damn they missed out on the daughters retarded running style.  




 Annoying that you have to purchase a new Blu Ray player since I was hoping that my PS4 would be play it. Hopefully the players aren't expensive. 




 Man I miss these guys, personal favourite of mine [Milkman vs Mailman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTBIHXwSLNE) 




 One can hope that FO4 isn't cross-gen. I doubt it would be though since memory has been a very large factor in why the games run like shit sometimes.  




 A more recent pick for me was John Wick, fucking loved the choreography.
