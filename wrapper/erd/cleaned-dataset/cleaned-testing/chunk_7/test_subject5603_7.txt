 Huckabee appears have confused the 'Militant gay community' with 'Americans who are not intolerant Assholes'. 




 I must have missed the news. When did the Kansas GOP have a mass lobotomy?  




 Everything's big in Texas.  Even the stupid. 




 Once again, Republicans take joy in finding yet another way to punish and humiliate the poor.  I'm not much for religion, but I like to imagine the moment when these GOP Christians present themselves for admission in heaven. Jesus will open his Bible, rub their noses in Matthew 25, and send them on their downward way.
Edit:  Grammar 




 [Twat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twat) is in an excellent insult for these self-congratulatory, divisive, thin-skinned politicians. Vaguely obscene, and insulting to both their manhood and intelligence. I may need to start using for our own dear Scott Walker. 




 There are a number of ideas floating around, including a couple in the article.  But the issue is that Walker promised his economic policies would create 250,000 jobs in four years and it hasn't happened.  Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else. Accept any responsibility for the lackluster economy in Wisconsin?  That's not the Scott Walker way. 




 Wisconsin ranked 40th in private sector job growth for the 12 months ending in September, said the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker has called hiring in his state the "gold standard" for measuring his performance.

But it must be somebody else's fault. Anybody else's fault.  









 It's a long term political strategy. [Because you know what educated people tend to do?](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/) 




 It's not just this law. It's the whole culture of intolerance and hate that permeates the Republican politic.  If you're skin is dark, if you aren't rich, or if you don't love Jesus just the right way, the Republicans are itching to pass a law to make your life more difficult. 




 How often does this happen? I hear about this all the time and I've never seen anyone buying luxury items with an EBT card. I've only seen slightly embarrassed people buying everyday groceries. 




 When the Democrats adopt this issue, they shouldn't make it about the 1%, but about [the .01%](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/chris-rock-inequality-rich-people_n_6248392.html). They probably won't though, [because] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/chris-rock-inequality-rich-people_n_6248392.html)...  




 Here we have today's most predictable headline.  




 Ornette Coleman's [Sound Grammar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMFhCoobptCZLRf_XA_5bM6eUD2ru9GaQ)   His greatest album since the 1950's. 




 Our current income and wealth distribution are a choice, not some iron economic law.  If voters ever wise up to that, we'll see better wages.  As long as they keep falling for the trickle down-job creators -investment scam, they'll stay poor.  




 Unfortunately, beating down on the least successful and unfortunate has been good politics for a long time.   




 But it doesn't keep our little "Scottie" from being an obedient pooch for America's moneyed interests. 




 Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard Universitys T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, "I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit." Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, "which has been a serious  and successful  effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections." **He said its the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but "never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost.**

But what does he know about correlation and causality? 




 In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care laws passage; its just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that "the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood."

Seems to me they addressed that. 




 Self promotion is a full time job.  Ted can't be distracted by the legislative process. 




 I would say that "low cost methods of manufacturing fossil fuels from plant/animal waste" is a form of renewable energy.  Replacing coal (which is the real problem) will probably be a multi-pronged solution, a better grid, using natural gas in combination with solar and wind, or maybe a solution we can hardly imagine or think possible.  I don't think the Wright Brothers thought their invention and those barely functional automobiles would replace the train as the main methods of transportation in America within a few generations. 




 Bernie, run for President already, will you? You're not going to win the nomination (any more than Ted Cruz is going to), but you could sure change the conversation. 




 Not long ago cellphones were unaffordable for most people, and a computer was something at a university or business that you waited for a turn to use. The communications and computer power we all have now were almost unimaginable just a few decades ago, and at a far lower price that very few anticipated.  I would argue we could effect the same change in energy.  A couple of decades of research and spending could change energy production and distribution completely, the same way communications and computing power have changed. Sticking with the fossil fuels is looking backward, like insisting that an IBM 360 mainframe and a AT T landline will serve all our future needs.  




 The problem isn't going to fixed by taxing the wealthy, it's going to fixed by changing the economic system. Between [1979-2007 period, after-tax income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by 275%, compared to 65% for the next 19 percent, just under 40% for the next 60 percent, 18% for the bottom fifth of households.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Post-1970_increase) 
I can't imagine that the top 1% started earning 275% more because they've become so much more productive and insightful.  We have a political party wholly in the thrall of the wealthy, and it's serving them very well. 




 The best way to infuriate Christians is not by ignoring religion, but by suggesting they're not taking following Christ's teaching.  Kasich trolls such Christians pretty well himself ["And I was saying how amusing it is to me that the conservative movementa big chunk of which is faith-basedseems to have never read Matthew 25."](http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/how-arrogant-prickly-smart-john-kasich-would-upend-2016-20150306)
 




 Because she has more balls than any male Republican legislator? 




 That'll fix everything.  Good thing Florida's legislature is concentrating on the crucial issues. 




 Only 16 out of 45.  Almost 2/3 voted against. 




 I would like nothing better than to see Walker go on a military base and tell everyone being an Eagle Scout makes him fully qualified to be their commander in chief.  This guy is either hopelessly deluded or hopelessly cynical.  Possibly both. 




  But still, whenever I hear talk that the Republicans intend to tackle inequality, I cant help thinking of Deep Throats adage: follow the money.

If you do that, you can readily understand everything the GOP has been doing for last few decades. 
Edit: typo 









 Cutting education spending is key to a prosperous America.  




 Probably true. If I heard that Cruz been smokin' up with Willie, it would improve my opinion of him. 




 Vote Republican! You don't want any rights or protections at work, do you? 




 Obama has his priorities straight.  An antibiotic resistant bacteria could kill a whole lot Americans than ISIS ever will.  




 I would go with Joan of Arc. That would allow him to fully express his heroic martyrdom.  




 That's why it's all the more surprising when he does something that makes sense. 




 Check out the ratings for Ted Cruz at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/) , [Factcheck.Org](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/factchecking-ted-cruz/) or the [Washington Post's Fact Checker] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/category/2016-candidates/).  Why does this guy still have any credibility at all?  Except for on the subject of [toilet seats](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/statements/byruling/true/).  He's a real truth teller when the subject is toilet seats. 




 Ending refundable tax credits and tax subsidies for business?  There are now two things I agree with Bobby Jindal on.  The other being when he said the Republicans needed to stop being "the party of stupid".  









 ...hoped GOP voters misunderstood

Has pretty much the GOP election strategy for last few decades 









 [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/allen-west/) has rated 72% of Allen West's statements Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire.  




 Perhaps we've underestimated the man.  Maybe he says these things because he has a finely tuned sense of irony and sarcasm. 




 When you have a [exceptional talent for dishonesty ](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/), it's a shame not to use it.  




 I hadn't read it. That's hilarious.  Politifact has rated one Ted Cruz statement as wholly true. It was about toilet seats. 




 "Today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers," Cruz said. "You know it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier."

This clown can't even get his [basic facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair) straight. Galileo was called a heretic over his heliocentric theory, not over the shape of the earth 




 Other income indicators also that show Wisconsin is heading in the right direction under Governor Walker, Patrick said Monday
...But UW-Madison economist Laura Dresser said **income growth in the state for decades has been concentrated among the top 1 percent**. She said that would explain the decline in the percentage of families considered middle class by federal standards, even if incomes have risen recently.
 
That would be exactly what the GOP thinks is the right direction. 




 Why not? Using the aircraft carrier as a prop worked so well for George W. Bush. 




 The actual math is this: $108 billion divided by 12 million equals $9,000. ... Aides declined to explain or comment on the inflated cost estimate.

Really, what could they say? "Mr. Sessions stands by his inability to do long division."

 




 Check out Ted's history at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/).  2% of his statements are rated true. 2%! Even among politicians, this guy manages to stand out with his lack of integrity. 




 [Gop_hates_God](http://np.reddit.com/user/GOP_Hates_God) has posted a great collection of Bible verses that Republicans never seem to cite. 




 No, they pick and choose the verses they like.  Kind of like they do with global warming data. 




 Ted Cruz , proving once again you can drop a load of BS without actually lying.   




 Seems to me Walker promised his policies would reverse that trend and create 250,000 jobs in 4 years.   




 I would like to see a billboard with Scott Walker's picture and this Bible quote on it.  Or most other Republican Presidential candidates for that matter. 




 I prefer to think of us as South Carolina North. 




 Don't blame Walker!  It's somebody else's fault. Anybody else. 




 Yeah he is. Anybody who would say this "I was saying how amusing it is to me that the conservative movement  a big chunk of which is faith-based  seems to have never read Matthew 25." is my kind of Christian. 




 Even a dog finds its ass every once in awhile.

Much better than the old line about a stopped clock is right twice a day.  




 George Will is like one of those aging Baby Boom rockers. He might have done some interesting work in the 70's , but he's been repeating himself and getting increasingly less interesting for decades. 




 No, of the potential Republican Presidential candidates, I would prefer Kasich. Though he seems like a long shot. 




 If you'd prefer polysyllabic words, we could say he's sanctimonious, unmannerly, and solipsistic.  Asshole is just shorthand.  




  If you did a web search for Senators Hate Ted Cruz on Sunday, that Foreign Policy article wouldnt have even come up on the first Google page. It was supplanted by titles like Why Senate Republicans Hate Ted Cruz, GOP Still Despises Ted Cruz, Everybody Hates Ted Cruz and the generously titled How Unpopular Is Ted Cruz Right Now? Answer: very.

TL DR: Because he's an asshole. 




 I think most liberals are awake.  It's the working class whites that need to catch on.  




 I cut an afternoon of high school and saw Buddy Guy (with Junior Wells) in 1973 at a blues festival.  He was great then too. Been a good long run for the man.  




 If he's telling us he's going to be an extraordinary useful tool for the bankers and billionaires, I'll go along with it.    




 The charts showing gerrymandering and money in politics are more than a bit sobering.  Not much of a democracy we're living in these days. 









 Scott Walker's Wisconsin - a high profit, low wage paradise. 




 However, when you include all taxes,  taxes [are not particularly progressive](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/) in the United States. 




 You look at this budget and you wonder why Republicans are accused  of not having a sense of humor. They obviously know how to tell a good joke. 




 "You dangle $700 million in front of the Louisiana Legislature now, and it's going to be spent as fast as green grass goes through a goose," the treasurer said

The party of fiscal responsibility in action! 




 Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf is the true intellectual inspiration for America's conservatives. 




 The Iranians were clearly made aware of the contents of the letter, but the GOP are claiming doesn't count because it wasn't actually sent through the mail?  Seems the Iranians see if [differently](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-nuclear-talks-20150316-story.html) 

 And check out the article if you want to read a fine example of NRO's hysterical hyperventilation
Obama is desperate for a deal with this radical-Islamic, terrorist-sponsoring, IED-detonating regime. And he wants Republicans to shut up about it. If Obama finds this Republican medicine bitter, he should stop pouring his own acrid elixir down their throats.
 




 Lie is such a harsh word. Let's just say it was a [drafting error](http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-debunking-scott-walkers-wisconsin-idea-drafting-error-claim-b99440321z1-291066791.html). 




 Well as long as it's not someone from the present, like Scott Walker. Besides, if Scott Walker becomes President, our future leaders will likely have Chinese names.  




 Bobby Jindal is angling for a position at Fox News.  




 If I were Walker, I don't think I'd want people to look too closely at his time in office in Wisconsin.  I can just imagine the attack ads if he's the Republican nominee -  'Scott Walker couldn't find criminal activity in his own office - Now he's telling us he can lead America against terrorists?' 




 Also no one in Florida is allowed to say Voldemort out loud. 




 Read the article and tell me if you think these position changes seem like a change of conviction or political convenience.  




 Once you decide the truth is flexible, everything is easy. 









 I bet Ted Cruz is pissed.  




 Somehow I don't think the ALEC approved Wisconsin Supreme Court is going to show a lot of sympathy to this lawsuit. 




 A politician with guts. Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act. 




 Could you imagine the reaction on Fox News if the Democrats tried this stunt under a Republican President?  Yet now, the outrage seems somewhat muted. 




 They ought to make it their campaign slogan -  Putting our party's interests ahead of America's security. 




 The GOP = 35 years of Higher Profits and Lower Taxes for the Wealthy, Lower Wages and Higher Taxes for Everyone else.  Everyone else really needs to wise up.   




 Perhaps, but if you strip it down to 3 it'll take awhile to crap it back up.  




 Why not a 3 tiered tax rate?  Almost as simple and would generate more revenue.   And it could be adjusted as economic needs changed.  Not enough investment capital? Drop the rate on the highest tier. Not enough consumer spending.  Lower the rate , or raise the amount of income  taxed, in the lowest tier. 




 How about we use the same level of proof that we used to justify invading Iraq?   




 Adults with dependent children can participate in KanCare, but only if they have incomes below 33 percent of the federal poverty level, $7,770 annually for a family of four.

Am I understanding this correctly?  If your family income is $2000 per person, you're not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas?   




 Just when you think politicians have reached the limit of ludicrous self-promotion, somebody raises the bar. 









 It would be more surprising if Walker continued funding this program. Renewable energy threatens the interests of his backers. 




 Specifically you want to thank the [Milwaukee suburbs and rural Wisconsin](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-2014-fall-election-results-map-281509401.html).  




 If you're looking for a President who does what the lobbyists want, you can't do better than Scott Walker. 









 Then I'm sure ALEC is in favor of lowering the wages down for bankers and CEO's ... Wait, or do they mean somebody else's wages?  The American worker really needs to wise up that there's an obscene rakeoff going on at the top. We can't have decent wages and social services while supporting a greedy upper class. 




 Unsurprising turn of events.  The GOP should adopt a new slogan - 'Vote Republican - You don't want any rights or protections at work anyway.' 




 Either this is a pretty good prank or you need to check your links. 




 And now his going to [France](http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/money/2015/02/26/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-plans-european-trade-mission/24057149/).  Maybe he'll compare handing the union protests to the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack. 




 Nobody is better qualified to lead the fight against terror than the guy  who couldn't find [criminal activity](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/walker-scandal-who-got-convicted-why-n35886) in his own office. 




 I'd call Inhofe an imbecile, but I think he doesn't quite measure up. 




 Fraudsters gotta fraud. 




 Sounds like something out of Charles Dickens, doesn't it? 




 The GOP game is to concentrate wealth at the top.  Why that isn't obvious to everyone, and why the Democrats don't make more of an issue out of it is a continuing mystery to me.  




 I think everything is working as planned.  Most of the earlier tax cutting was on income taxes, and are being replaced with 'much regretted' consumption taxes and fees, which fall more heavily on lower and middle classes.  I used to believe the good sense of the American people wins out in the end.  Now, I'm beginning to think it's their gullibility. 




 By all means, let's listen to the man who told us the Iraq war will pay for itself.  Who knows what new inanities he has to tell us? 




 Republicans being incredibly misleading ... you know, I think I've heard this before. 




 Yes, it is a bit hyperbolic, and I believe I first read the remark about studies about health, which are particularly polluted with sponsored 'studies'.  But it is also true that industry looks for scientists who are already inclined toward the viewpoint they want. (I'm not saying the scientists themselves are dishonest. I assume they legitimately believe their arguements.) You notice these industries didn't pick a random professor of atmospheric science to study the problem, they funded the one who was likely to say what they wanted to hear. Sponsoring studies with an outcome in mind that would be to your own financial and political advantage far more 'negligent to science' than some skepticism about a study and its funding sources.  




 No not really.  Studies sponsored by an industry tend to support what the industry wants.  They look to hire researchers that are favorable to their industry, and if the results aren't too their liking, they're not required to publish them. 
Obviously, there are studies from independent sources that aren't biased, but generally they aren't sponsored by anyone with an agenda.  




 Mr. Bush and other presidential hopefuls said the presidents patriotism was not in doubt. But Mr. Walker repeatedly said he did not know. On Saturday, he said he did not know whether Mr. Obama was a Christian.

The Democrats should also play this game.  Some former Presidential candidate should accuse Walker of hypocrisy and dishonesty, and then everyone can say that they don't know if Walker is a hypocritical liar, Make it part of the public discussion.
 




 Want to know what a study says?  Don't bother to read it, just look at who paid for it.   




 Retired homeowners rarely seem to understand is that the quality of the school district is a big part of what makes up their home's value.  They'll save a few dollars on their tax bills, but might lose it several times over on their home's equity.
