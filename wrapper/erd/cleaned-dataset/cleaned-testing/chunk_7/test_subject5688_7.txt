 No. Well, at least I don't think I did. 




 Directed by Michael Bay. 









 Married with children? More like happiness in slavery. 




 I agree. I'm glad that 'Satelite' an 'Everything' are back to back.  I just hit the skip button twice, and the album is solid. 
 









 The shadow of a nose picker. 




 This is what this subreddit should be about.
 




 You're a looney!
 














 I like the part where...the obscurity part.
 




 It's not shopped, if that's what you mean.
 




 Not my tattoo, but I thought /r/zombies might like it!

 That hurts. A lot. 




 /r/wallpapers.
  




 Yarp.
 




 Safety standards circa 1989. 









 I'm happy I found this subreddit.

 Canine canines.
 




 TIL that three Earth hours equal 2 Mars days.

 I was given the same privilege here in Australia in 2005. All I can remember is getting into a debate with the band about where to sign on a vinyl. Aaron started by saying that you shouldn't sign on the grooves. Geordie signed on the inner circle. When Trent came along, all I could muster up was, "To groove, or not to groove?". 

TLDR: I'm lame. 




 We meet again.
 
























 The live version from Still is so good. 




 You see so much nonchalance in these videos.

 I don't understand how Vevo is advertising a video that doesn't exist.
 




 I'll be honest, until now I've had a hard time supporting artists that have come from a televised talent show lineage (eg. Lisa Mitchell). This song has kind of changed that.
 




 Lyrically, I agree. Musically, not so much.
 




 I wish somebody turned it into one.
 




 Radmobiles.
 




 "Here's your passport sir, but don't you dare leave the country". You should cross-post this to r/funny. 




 Shine on you crazy diamond. 




 The walls are melting. Again.
 




 The rest of her EP is just as good.
 









 I like the guy up front that watches, then claps.
