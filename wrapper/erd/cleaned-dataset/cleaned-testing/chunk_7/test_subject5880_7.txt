 You know they've gotta consult their boss before they release anything about it. You can't really expect a lower level employee in charge of social networking to tell you everything will be fixed in a month, while eleaf is probably just learning about the issue and not sure what to do.  




 I'd say something exactly like that about the istick 50w, tbh. I haven't been on here in a couple weeks and just now am seeing this giant craze of everyone throwing out their eleaf products. If I hadn't known about that I'd still say that my iStick 50w is freaking awesome. I haven't had a single issue with it. Everyone raves about good products they have on here, and every day that I'm on here I see someone raving about how an order they placed got fulfilled and actually got to their doorstep. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say that just because they're raving happy about the istick that they're an eleaf rep.  




 Congrats, friend.  




 Don't have a serial number. Wanted to chime in and say that I got my 50w via the SmogGB directly from eleaf, and have had it for almost 2 months, and have had no problems at all. It is the only power source I've used since getting it, and I treat it like a baby. Hardly ever even sees my pocket, as my shitty dripper leaks everywhere. I carried over the habit from my mech mod of turning it off after each time I'm done using it. If you are worried about flames, buy lipo safety bag for under $20 online. No matter what vape I'm charging overnight, the first three charges are always in the bag.  if it's ever charging and I'm not home, it's in the bag.

 Personally didn't get tinnitus from loud noise, but rather a blow to the head.  




 You're not having fun until you can see your tinnitus :). I have both noise in my ears and my vision, as I have what is called snowy vision. I can't ever hear silence, and I can't ever see plain-ness. I too hope there are some advances to remove noise from our senses.  




 It's really old. You sure?

 So, Saints Row?  




 My dad just informed me of the same thing about the other boot XD. When I go back to work on that caliper I'll take the wheel off that side and push the boot back into place. Thank you! 




 (Illuminati)^n 




 Absolutely excellent link, man. Thank you so very much for the advice. 




 It came too far out? That seems accurate - as I first spinned it to the left (Thinking lefty loosey), and it began to leak fluid and got wobbly. However I just held and spun her back to the right and the leaking became minimal/nonexistant and it seemed back in place. How could I go about putting it back in place? Is it fixable, if this is the issue? 




 I'm having an issue changing out brake pads and rotors on a 2003 20th Anniversary Mk4 GTI. On the driver side, after removing the caliper from the rotor, opening the brake fluid reservoir, and using a special tool (the traditional 3/8"drive cube with two edges ground down) to turn the caliper's piston clockwise, the piston only goes in about 3/4 of the way. [Here's an image of first the right side piston, and the left side piston compressed completely.](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj)

Anyone know why the piston won't go in any farther? I can't fit it over my pads and rotors. I've even put the special tool on an electric drill and sat there for a couple minutes just free spinning the piston - however it doesn't go in any farther. 

I'm really screwed and out of a ride - hoping for some advice.  




 It can move in and out, just can only go in about 3/4 of the way (the distance shown in the photo). It actually spins very much more freely than the one that retracted completely. 




 Yes I did, thank you for replying.

 The issue is that you will sometimes be given dye packs. In something like a stack of 20s, there will be only 4 real bills - two on the front two on the back, and the rest are hollowed out and fit a hard unbending dye pack. These can be avoided by bending the centers of packs of bills. These dye packs are set off by a couple proximity triggers in the ceiling tiles above the doorway.

 I was hoping maybe someone has experienced this problem I'm having with USPS. I ordered Eliquid from Vape Wild, expecting it to be here by today, as I'm out of Eliquid. However, my package seems to be not moving from Texas any time soon. 

[Here's an image of the tracking info.] ( http://imgur.com/YtnceJJ) 

Any insight into this issue is greatly appreciated. I'm hoping it isn't any legal issues Texas is currently experiencing. 




 Well, at least it's now a famous piece of artwork. 

Just a forewarning for all those who don't know, drinking and taking benzodiapenes can and a lot of the time will kill you and/or rape your liver. 




 I'll take one for the team.

 I was wondering when MBV would go public about this. They've seemed very reserved publically about the Washington issues so far. It's a real true bummer that ideas like these are even considered in government.

Is there anything that a customer who doesn't live in Washington can do? Best of luck MBV!

 I can't urge you enough to call 911

All you have to give is an address and you can hang up.

There are people that can bring that happiness back into your life again, Chris.  




 Please dont. Is there anything else you can give me? I want to help you. A phone number so I can talk to you? The city you're in by any chance?  




 Are you saying that you think you'll live through tonight?

If so, i'd call that hardly a failure. It takes great strength to be able to be where you are now.  




 What do you think you failed? 




 You think you might be able to stay a little longer, my friend? 




 Ah, I see. A friend of mine does the same down in TN - he's 101st Airborne. Are you Army Naitonal Guard or Air National Guard? 




 I know you're fighting me, bud. But I really do want you to live. I see the numerous clues you've left throughout this thread as to your location, and it seems just looking at that, that deep down you want to live, too. At this moment you just don't quite know how. 

It will come to you in time. Maybe therapy doesnt work at first. It all seems like a pile  of shit. When I went through therapy, I actually found that things got worse right before they started getting better than I've ever seen before,  and that was because I was forced to finally face all of the things in life that I buried so deep inside. Once you work through facing that, once you start to learn how to feel in control of yourself again, things will get better. It doesn't have to end like this, my friend.  




 Do you have buddies on base with you? Is there someone you can talk to first thing in the morning on base? The area is surrounded with people who could possibly help you, and people there care about you whether it's easy to see or not, as do I. I'd rather see you make it on base tomorrow than pass here tonight.  




 Check this out. [National Guard has a crisis hotline. You can not only call but simply chat online.] ( http://www.guardyourhealth.com/suicidal-crisis-support/) 

Here is the night time call number I was given through my group therapy.

When I'm considering suicide, and I don't want to listen to anything else, I read this. It's broken up into comfortable segments. It's meant for times like now.

 The offices nighttime line should always have a therapist standing by. The behavioral medicine center of the hospital is always open for nighttime calls, and they know how to help you. 

If you give me just a moment, I'm going to dig through my group therapy binder and find you some of my resources.  




 That's a recipe for an extremely uncomfortable feeling, my friend. I've been on all those medications. I beg you not to go through with it. 

If you're going to go through with it, think of this. 24 more hours. What difference would it make? Say you give yourself just 24 more hours. You revisit this tomorrow, ask yourself if you still want to do it. If you do, it will be the same result as you taking your life tonight. But say maybe you don't - you might really find happiness again someday in the very near future.  




 You have a safety plan set up through this group therapy, or through one of your therapists? Are there some actions you can take according to that? It's there for a reason :). 

If not, man, I just really want to remind you that this is the biggest decision you can make in your lifetime, and that like every other big decision, sometimes you really want to take the time to educate yourself on both sides of it. 

Do you think you'd like to call your therapist? Maybe just tell her what's going on and how you're feeling, just to see what she might say? 

How will the others in your group therapy feel, knowing that they might be in similar shoes as you, and not seeing you make it out of therapy alive?  




 well i mean, i wouldnt drive at the moment cause that would be just straight up dangerous to others, trying to kill myself, not others...

My friend, what if I pointed out that, by leaving, you will injure every person around you in a way that they will never be able to heal or recover from? 

Stay for the people around you. There may be people in your life who can't survive without you. A friend of mine who passed away from suicide criticized this - he said it was selfish for other people to tell him to stay for them, however this reason to be alive will change over time. You won't, for the rest of your life, live just to spare the ones around you from pain. One day you'll look back on this night in tears happy that you made it out alive. I'm not Bullshitting, either :), I've had that moment. It's a very real thing. You've got so much ahead of you, my friend. 

I tried to pass in the same way you're going about it right now. I don't recommend it. I'd like to ask, and hopefully you'll tell me, what medication it was that you picked up? 

 




 The thing about a psychiatrist, they are a specialist in behavioral medicine. Not so much therapy. A lot of people try to have a psychiatrist and a psychologist - or primarily a psychologist. They are specialists in therapy. They can really make a difference.

 Okay, thank you. I happen to have a console version, so I have no access to directories like the .bsa files. Is there anywhere on the Internet I could find this directory? I haven't been able to so far.  




 That just happened to me! I was standing inside of one all wtf and then this nasty looking bird thing landed in between my feet.
