 Thank you, so much!!  




 I started rewatching TWD, these past few days, and thought I should paint Rick. I could use the practice; it was challenging, but fun! 









 
Thank you! I appreciate you for reaching out!  




 Wow! Thank you! That's very useful!
I really appreciate it, because my back has been killing me :O 




 I apologize for the sob story. I'm just not sure where to turn to, anymore.
