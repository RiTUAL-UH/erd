 I want to be clear that this isn't an absolute to me.  I don't believe in "I don't believe it, so it can't be true."

That said, it was a combination of two things.  In first grade I was very into Greek and Norse mythology.  People used to believe these over-the-top stories.  Now they believe new ones... it just made sense to me that in the natural progression, people would believe something else someday.  This was in addition to seeing a diagram of the various systems inside the human body.  I saw that it was a machine that was self-sufficient.  The soul was totally unnecessary and had no place in it.  And so at 7 I stopped feeling god was true.  I couldn't undo that feeling.     




 Oh no.  It freaked me out, because it was indicative of how far he would go to avoid things he didn't want to do, but I made him an appointment with the optometrist.  It was really cute to watch him stare at things for a month after.  I think he'd forgotten what leaves looked like.  




 If that is something people really believe, they should take a look at the number of African American males drafted during the Vietnam War.  The draft is in no way impartial.  




 I apologize, I didn't Google the statistic, that was just what I'd heard back in high school.  I'll edit it.  




 That is actually a great point and something to think about.  I believe that it just hasn't been on anyone's radar.  Apparently in the 1980's a plan was made to have skill-specific drafts for Health Care personnel that would include women, but the plans were never acted upon.  It's interesting, but I think the draft just isn't a priority in light of all the other pressing issues we have at the moment.     




 but it is a necessary evil to exist. 

Source please.  In the context of the United States today, there is no reason whatsoever for the draft to exist.  My views are not "convenient," they are what I believe.  I'm sorry if that doesn't fall in line with the box you're trying to shove me into.   




 If you're interested in my opinions on specific events in history, please PM me and I'd be happy to discuss.  My opinions on the use and execution of the US draft vary by conflict and aren't relevant to this thread. 
Edit: grammar 




 Is this a serious question?  We haven't used the draft since the Vietnam War... we've participated in 15 military conflicts since then.  Through voluntary enlistment, obviously.  




 Sorry for double replying, but I had some more things I wanted to talk about here, upon thinking about it.

I think that we don't make the draft a priority because at this point in time, it's a non-issue.  You register, but can you even imagine how the nation would have reacted if they had drafted for the controversial war in Iraq?  It would have been pandemonium.  You have to prioritize here.  You register for the draft, you get a free razor, you'll never be called into action because the times have changed.

My main focus on civil rights actually has nothing to do with feminism.  It's to do with educating the people in my area about assimilation of Native Americans.  I live on the edge of a reservation and the amount of racism is unbelievable.  

If you asked me to give my complete agenda as a feminist, it would merely be that I want white men to speak out when they see things that are unfair, even if it is going to be unpopular.  This isn't unique to feminism, but to that casual homophobic remark that is made among friends, or that racist joke someone made that you don't agree with.  Instead of laughing along, I'd like to see white men recognize that they have the responsibility of setting the expectation for what is acceptable and what is not and use that power for good.  This doesn't seem crazy to me.  




 I like things that are uncommon or unique.  I like it when a guy is wearing a vintage bowling shirt or gas station work shirt with the wrong name on it.  I like guys who recognize baggy corduroy pants are mega comfortable.  I like it when they dress according to what size they actually are, rather than going with XXL at 140 lbs soaking wet.  Just preferences, not deal breakers.  My husband is actually one of those people who wears the same thing everyday just in different color variants.      




 If I saw a protest against the draft in my area, I would 100% be there.  I posted an article as a response to one of the above questions.  Many mens issues are actually covered under feminism.  My heart breaks for men who have been sexually assaulted and feel they cannot get help.  I find the fact that men are nearly ~~twice~~ four times as likely to commit suicide to also be a very real issue.  Now, I'm not a super active activist.  I work full-time, I have a 8 month old daughter, and I spend 6 hours every weekend volunteering with a hospice, but I do what I can.   




 You're taking issue with the wrong thing.  There are about 25 good reasons to abolish the draft.  It's a broken system and one we're never going to return to.  On the off chance you actually care about educating yourself on the real issue, here is [this.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/16/america-may-never-have-a-draft-again-but-were-still-punishing-low-income-men-for-not-registering/) 




 I call it "my downstairs mixer," which I do to amuse myself.  It's a bastardization of the phrase "Downstairs Mix-up" as coined by Old Gregg in the Mighty Boosh.   




 Probably at the point it came to my attention that he couldn't see clearly even fifteen feet away.  He'd had glasses a decade ago, accidently sat on them, and had such bad anxiety he couldn't bring himself to make an appointment and get them replaced.  I felt totally overwhelmed in that moment.  




 I'm not sure why you downvoted me.  Clearly you don't actually care about responses, merely about making a statement disguised as a question.  




 As a feminist, I find the existence of the draft to be unfortunate.  I don't think it should exist at all.  




 Giving birth. I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you. I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain. Too many endorphins. 

Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...
 




 Because what you're talking about is found at /r/unorthodog !

Both my dogs belong there.  ;) 




 Do yourself a favor and watch "Let me In."

It's time to take a break from that Uncle Buck, Problem Child bullshit you're clearly inundated with.  




 Try this instead: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2oijc5/girls_of_reddit_when_the_guys_arent_around_what/cmnfnr3?context=3

I should start a "Best of late_night_grumbler" subreddit.  




 That's very strange... you gel with "I feel so lucky you wanna hug me... what rhymes with hug me?"  That's not very pithy imo. 




 Really?  I thought that was hilarious!  He said "witch hunt" in the context of Harry Potter.  I'm laughing as I type this!  

P.S. I hope you didn't just down-vote me because you didn't get it... You'll prove him right!  




 I would be very, very careful, and ask in a subreddit that isn't this one, since you're probably just going to get some very dangerous suggestions.  Good luck!  




 Well, I'm not really sure what you're driving at, but my sister lost 20 lbs. by walking 20,000 steps a day and eating oatmeal with unsweetened applesauce two meals a day.  She said it put her at something like a 1,000 calorie deficit.

 Danielle, is that you? 




 I have two:

"In my head there's only you now, and this world falls on me.  In this world is real and make believe, but this seems real to me."

"You feel the tugging of the world, so soft and slow, turning you round and round." 









 This isn't what you're asking, but I've got a good story for you...

I used to work in a call center scheduling appliance repair appointments.  I had scheduled a refrigerator repair for this elderly man.  He went with this gem : Well, Georgie, now that you've taken care of my fridge, you can take care of me with your sexy voice..."

I just about died.   




 I appreciate your support! :)  It's funny how you can never really predict what will resonate with people.  I woke up that morning to 19 replies and 1000 up votes and it was all because some ex-boyfriend tried to pass this off as fact because he'd heard a politician say it on the news once.  It was such a weird thing to think that I never forgot it.  




 Excitable Boy by Warren Zevon is pretty dark.  This just comes to mind since I'm listening to the album right now.   




 This is actually super awkward.  Mine is "Women can't participate in trench warfare because they will die from a yeast infection if they get too dirty."

I'm sure I'd spend A LOT of time explaining that I don't actually believe this and being admonished for public indecency since we shouldn't talk about vaginal infections.  




 You should absolutely take the quiz on the AKC website, but the King Charles Cavalier Spaniel is the closest thing to a one-size fits all dog.  They are well mannered, quiet, affectionate, easy to train, love children, and only require a bit of exercise.  ~~They suffer from very few medical issues as a breed.~~   
Edit: Strikeout, see comment below. 




 It would be one of those things that would force me into conversations all the time. "Well, that takes care of that."  Uh.. what exactly?  

I collect antique buttons, and one of them reads simply "Ask me what happiness is." I have no idea what this means, and I don't wear it because I don't like to talk to strangers.  Ahaha! 




 Seeking psychiatric help is not as stigmatized as it is for our male counterparts.  




 In the US, I think it would be assimilation of the native Americans.  This went on for 150 years.  The fact that my mother grew up not five miles away from a reservation but only learned about this from me at age 49 is unconscionable.    




 I know I already posted, but I wanted to give you some practical advice upon thinking about it.  The classes are all taught by individual professors, the curriculum is determined by that professor.  You may have what looks like a "freshmen level" course on your schedule that is actually a senior level class due to the person teaching it.  You are paying for your transcript.  If at all possible, talk to your upperclassmen before signing up for classes.  Try to get an idea of whether the level is accurate.  You don't want to take a super difficult class in addition to 18 credits and then pay for that bad grade just because some asshole didn't get the memo that this class is supposed to be "freshmen level."  




 If you really had your heart pinned on that "Just wait until college, everything will be different" spiel they give you all through High School, please be advised there is an awful lot that is just like High School.  Bubble tests and group projects still exist and you'll spend more time reading the opinions of others than you will engaging in your own abstract thought.  




 AAA doesn't have online payments or paperless billing.  What the hell, AAA?   




 I can't speak for my generation, only me... however I will say it seems to me that my husband's generation (he's 39) has a taste for irony or "pretend liking."  They're a very sardonic lot.  It strikes me as rather self-conscious and joyless.  




 It's to connotate that you are incredulous.  It should always be the question mark first.  You're asking a question... with spirit!  Try rewording that sentence to reflect the opposite... it's not possible.  :)   




 Everything happens for the best.  Uh... What?  




 How dare I answer an opinion based question with an opinion? 




 Obviously, however, it misses the point.  Rather like Joelle.  Look, it's Joel or Noel or Elle or Joann, let's not be crazy here.  I'm saying this as a person with a superfluous letter in her 9 character, four syllable name.  




 Katie is supposed to be a shortened version of Katherine, right?  So what is up with "Kade" and "Katy?"

I'm also not very impressed with how there are about four different ways to spell "Brit-knee..."  I don't really want to have to think this hard to take down a common name.  




 If that is what you think, you need to try the Reese Stix with coffee... holy smacks, guys, it's life changing.  




 As a salaried employee who was under a lot of pressure, working the 56 hour weeks while pregnant was very hard.  I didn't feel well, I was over-worked, and I was hormonal.  I spent a lot of time having to close my blinds to my office, ugly cry for ten minutes, then pretend like it never happened.   




 Sounds good to me! :) 




 Absolutely, that would be just fine.  I just don't want to have to deal with using a wet brush, it seems unsanitary.  If I could apply wet and have it become dry without having to use a sponge or brush, that would be great.  I really like a chunky pencil eyeshadow too.  Those are very convenient.

A moisturizing stain would be great.  I have a dual one that is a clear balm on the other end, and that works very well. :) 




 I hate bananas.  Looking at them makes me want to cry.  I hate the smell, I can't touch them.  I don't know if I was raped with a banana at three or what, but goddamn it, I don't want them in my house.  Go away, banana.  




 Thanks for giving me the chance to complain about this.  I just had the asshole who runs mortgage come in here.  He's super bossy.  Like "Call Steve." Instead of "Can you call Steve?"  He also treats my time like it means nothing, having said he'd come up to see me now and then not showing up for 30 minutes.  We have e-mail for a reason if you're on the phone, man.  But then he has the audacity to run a damn guilt trip on me as he's leaving because I'm not super friendly with him "Hope that wasn't too awful for you...."  It was, thanks.  Get out.   




 To whoever downvoted me, I hope you realize how ridiculous it is that the John Mayer song is now above Neil Young.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  




 Highly pigmented eye shadow that doesn't have fall out.  I don't like that my stupid Urban Decay Naked 3 palette is a best selling $54 purchase, but has to be used wet to actually be visible.  I also have to use Vaseline under my eyes to wipe away the fall out using it dry.

Eye liner that starts smudgeable, but becomes permanent, like the 24/7 by Urban Decay.  

Lipstains vs. Lipsticks, I've never come across a lipstick that didn't leave my lips flaky the next day. 

The Candlelight powder by Too Faced is one of my all-time favorite purchases.  I use that instead of a foundation as I don't have blemishes.  




 Cortez the Killer - Neil Young 




 "How to Win Friends and Influence People" - Dale Carnegie 

You don't fully appreciate how apathetic people are to you as an individual until someone calls your attention to the glaze-over the minute you quit talking about the person you're talking to.  Thanks Dale for proving once and for all that loneliness is the human condition.   




 Bitch please, I always know where I want to eat.  If my indecisive husband didn't turn down all my ideas, we'd be in business.  Indecisiveness has nothing to do with gender, it's to do with being weak-willed.  




 They aren't compensated well.  The average professional musician makes $40k a year.  Try living on that in California.  




 Helium!  Seriously guys, you should look into Helium as an alternative retirement plan.  It's a finite resource that people use at any celebration.  It's cheap, but will become a luxury!  




 If "Bat Outta Hell" is your cuppa, you'll love "For Crying Outloud." I mean, there isn't an overblown resurrection scene, but it is completely over the top.  I like to sing BoH to my baby.  This is, at best, irresponsible parenting, and at worst, child abuse.  




 Right.  I simply can't relate.  Why won't you let me love you? 




 2deep4me ;) 




 Look out, guys, I'm going to say something controversial.  

When I was a kid, Iowa's state sign read "Iowa, you make me smile!"  They changed it a few years back to "Fields of Opportunity."

It should read "Fields of opportunity for seventh generation Germans."

Ahaha! Seriously though, don't you move to small town Iowa and expect people to accept you. They wave, but they don't actually want you to say "Hello!"  




 Well, it's been awhile, but I know we never used style guides in high school.  You should just see what happens if you use a comma where you would naturally pause in a sentence as a guideline in your college papers.  




 Abra.  I try to interact with him, he fails to respond in any way, and then POOF! He's not there.  




 I'm pragmatic enough to have tried. She is, however, pretty stubborn. If I say that she's gotten really loud, she'll say "I know, it's intentional." Which is totally untrue. The only thing for it is to get really quiet so she has to pipe down to hear me, but try maintaining that level of unnatural manipulation for any period of time.  




 Bought myself the "expensive" mimosa and ended up getting tunnel-vision drunk on accident.  I still remember my husband saying to me over the late-night supper he bought me to sober me up "What have we done?" 




 I see what you did there, but I want her to get quieter.  This damn Stonehenge she made me is too small too, but this is the bigger issue. ;) 




 She gets really loud after about an hour.  She is seriously ignorant of the volume of her voice.  She'll start normal and crank it up to about 11.  After a day with her, I'll have been clenching my teeth so hard I have a splitting headache.  I need a nap after visiting her.  




 I haven't actually gotten very much parenting advice, but I did have someone give me some when I was 18, and I was touched by the fact that he'd bothered.

My best friend's dad was chopping up some mangoes on a wooden cutting board in the living room.  He said to me, "You can buy fruit, put it on the counter, and watch it rot as your kids walk by it or you can cut it up and serve it with dinner and watch them eat it.  You'll have kids some day, so this is my advice to you.  Take the ten minutes." 




 Looking for closure in the "Dads who abandoned their families, why/what happened?" thread.  




 Utilize the seven second rule on the freeway.  In addition to being able to guarantee I have enough time to brake completely instead of rear ending the car in front of me, I'm also not blinding them with my headlights at night.  




 Yeah, man, seriously no judgment.  I would literally trade away years of my life for a few hours with him as an adult, no matter what kind of person he was.  I still miss him.  I think about him every day.  Just do what you can.  Your son may not appreciate it now, but someday he will.  I promise.    




 Hey man.  My father died when I was 12 years old from an accidental drug-alcohol interaction.  He was a drug addict, an alcoholic, and he was violent.  I didn't know him.  I have two memories of him.  When I was two, he and my mother were screaming at each other in the living room.  I was sitting on a braided rug pleading with them to "Stop it."  The second was when I was four.  He met me and my little sister at a park for two hours.  

I have to second what Kazuke86 is saying here.  If, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you, you have to think about what that will leave your son.  I will never know my dad first hand.  I'll never know if he ever thought about me, if he loved me.  I can only guess.  It would be a huge comfort to me to have even just one little thing to remember him by.  Regardless of the things I've heard, I would still love to have been able to see him in person and to form my own conclusions and build my own memories.  He is half of who I am genetically.  I'm told that I do little things with my hands and my head like he did, but I don't know that.  By the time I was old enough to be able to choose to contact him, he was already dead.  You need to do this.  Please.  Leave him something.   




 Ours is a pretty amber color! 




 Well, semi-truck and pickup truck. I can see why it's silly, I guess. 




 I don't actually have any idea what you're talking about.  Colonel Sanders was a total caricature masterminded by Dave Thomas.  The Colonel would probably have NO PROBLEM with these commercials considering the fact that he willingly turned himself into a parody of a southern gentlemen while he was alive.  

This isn't related, but did you know that his daughter was actually married to John Wayne Gacy, the infamous rapist-serial killer?  Beyond that, he managed stores for him at one point and there are photos of him in the leisure suit.

 Well, I can't speak from a lawyer-ly standpoint, but I can tell you that the laws are different from state to state.  Here in Minnesota we are in what is called a "no-fault" divorce state.  It doesn't matter who was worse.  It takes two to tango.  If you don't have a pre-nup, don't expect damages.  




 So THAT'S where the Canadians got it from!   




 How's the weather down there?  

This is probably too specific, but the stupid change machine in our break room was very loud and every time someone used it some original person would say "Jackpot!" Finally I made this up: "If I had a quarter for every time someone said that, I wouldn't need to use this change machine!"  




 Right after my Great Grandpa passed away, my Great Grandmother told this one anecdote over and over that took place a few days before he passed.  They knew he was dying from colon cancer, and he'd been sent home to rest.  The family started arriving from out of state to say good bye.

One afternoon he was napping on the couch.  When he woke up, he was surrounded by family members.  He said to my Grandma what she thought was "That was a hell of a week," and she said "The next one will be just like it," and he corrected her "No.  I said that was a hell of a wake."

I didn't get the black humor until I was a grown-up.  




 My mom used to regularly trot these out:

"Well, you can do whatever you want, but you know how I feel."

"I know you're going to do whatever you want because you think I'm stupid."
 




 I received a speeding ticket.  I got lost approximately 50 miles out of the way on the way home from a poor-person's dentist appointment (meaning it was at night and about 150 miles from my home). 




 I'd tell them right away.  The last thing I would want is for my employer to think I'm suddenly coming to work hung-over and half asleep.  When I got pregnant, I was a salaried employee who was expected to go above and beyond.  Despite being pregnant, they made me fly cross-country five times in six months. 




 That they call the part that covers the engine of your car a bonnet.  What is that about?  Way to make a muscle car sound like a walk on in "Little House on the Prairie."  

(Yeah, this was tongue in cheek.) 




 One time I came into the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant I was working in, and there was a decaying deer hung from the ceiling.  Now, I'm not saying that I think they were serving it, I don't.  But I do think they left it in the back of a truck open for a few days because the smell was unlike anything I've ever encountered and I come from a family of hunters.  




 I only have two dream jobs: Lead singer in a Warren Zevon cover band (I'm a girl and not enough people know who that is), and Namer of Paint Samples (I don't think this is all there is to that job, but I can't find any additional information). 




 I literally have no idea what was going on in 1030.  Too lazy to Google.  I'd probably be killing a lot of rats?  Covering my hair?  Sticking a copper coin up my hoo-ha so I don't die in child birth? I don't know...   




 My least favorite is Hannibal.  Not only is it loud-quiet to the extreme, the wine filling up the face is uncannily like watching the logo bounce around on your DVD screensaver... it never finishes (hits the exact corner) no matter how many times you see it.  




 Feminism is synonymous with misandry. 




 My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour (I was very pregnant usually already in bed at the point it was turned on, the dogs would wake me up), but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!  




 This isn't HEROIC per say, but a silly thing I did for the purpose of making a delusional person happy.  

My high school boyfriend lived out in the middle of nowhere.  This did not stop his mom from being very into Halloween and talking about trick or treaters and preparing for these people she imagined would come to her house.  Now, I was with this kid for years.  The third year came and undeterred by the lack of show the last two years, his mom was ready and pumped about the trick or treaters.  I put a change of clothes behind the bar next to their back sliding glass door.  I dressed up like a boy (wrapped my midsection in a beach towel I held in place with a belt), put on gloves, and a full head mask, snuck around the back to the front door and trick or treated.  She talked about this trick or treater every year after. I never told her the truth.  




 By the same ticket, I was in total disbelief when I heard about your cream soda being a totally different color and that you sell Tylenol 3 without a prescription.   




 Would you alert the authorities? Exact vigilante justice? Do something else entirely?  




 Well, I tried to help you by digging around a bit myself, but what I'm seeing is that people who have trouble being fed aren't being studied.  I found a great article on girls in Ghana feeling pressured by the media to be thin, but it states right in the article that all girls polled are attending school and have regular access to food.  I'm sorry I don't have a good source for you, but it just stands to reason that if you have to go to considerable effort to survive, your appearance and need to exact control would be low on your list of priorities.  Hunter-gatherers have to stay busy.  




 I don't think this is really what you're driving at, but eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia are unique to first world countries.  You will not find them in places where food is actually scarce.  It is a disease of convenience (despite being serious). 




 Useful things you never have when you need them... like a tire pressure gauge.  Or nail clippers.   




 Probably the lead singer/song writer of a death metal band.  He's going to be very disappointed when he finds out my morbid interests don't translate in any way to my appearance.  




 I don't do this, but I'm guessing that it's for the same reason they paint their lips black or dye their hair bright green... it pleases them to do so.  They like the way they look.  The assumption that women preen simply to attract partners is very silly. 




 50 Cent.  He's tough, resilient, business minded, objective, and largely considered to be nowhere near as smart as he actually is.

 If you really mean my name, it would be "We don't follow her logic either..."

If you mean if I as a person were a brand name it would probably be "Only 3% joking at any time..."
