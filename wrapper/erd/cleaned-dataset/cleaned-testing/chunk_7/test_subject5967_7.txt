 Matt Kemp is getting ownage on the Dodgers.  




 Channel 451 on Dish.  




 How can I watch on direct tv. I can't right now because the Warriors game is blacked out.  




 It's a good thing the stadium is half empty or else the boos would be deafening.  




 This was (allegedly) Gucci Mane's response when the judge asked him If he was guilty of assault.  




 I don't feel too attached to any team other than the giants, but I like underdogs, so I've been pulling for Seattle recently.  




 162*-0 




 That makes sense and I do like that new rule. I don't like the clock though.  




 What is the point of all the time saving measures? Is it to attract new fans? Somehow I don't think people who are unwilling to watch a 3:00 game are all of a sudden going to get into a 2:45 minute game.  




 My first word was also ball. If it's any indication, your son will likely grow up slow and unathletic and be forced to live his sports dream vicariously through others.   




 I couldn't have picked a better week to get the flu. I plan on spending the week on the couch watching baseball.  




 I'm trying to figure this out. [Here]( http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head.cgi?teams=STL from=1964 to=1979 submit=Submit) are the Cardinals head-to-head records against every team they played against from 1964 to 1979, the years Brock played for the team. The A's aren't listed. The only answer can think of is that this was a spring training game, but I can't find stats for spring training from those years.  




 With Peavy and Cain hurt, what are the chances Bum pitches again tomorrow?  




 Propane and propane assessories.  




 David Aardsma would be able to shut this game down.  




 I could go for some Tony Torcato right now.  




 Someone gif that dancing lady!  




 Why do managers go to the bullpen to get the lefty/lefty matchup against Crawford? He rakes lefties.  




 Tuffy Gosewisch sounds like a computer generated name on RTTS.  




 Definitely not a pregnant woman.  




 Never thought a Matt Kemp double would cause me to fist pump.  









 Let's have a good season, guys and girls.  




 Same here. Already got my tickets for 4/11.  




 This is just how he sells the fight. He doesn't actually mean it.  




 If you hate him so much, why would you want him to get a ring?  









 Ah, the classic "Stephanie's Team." Good choice.  




 Does the bare finger actually go in or is it all done with the leotard as a barrier?  




 I see this alluded to originally on this subreddit, but I don't know what it means. 




 I hate it when people compare Kris Bryant to Jesus. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Kris Bryant.  




 Baseball is a better sport when the Cubs are competitive. I'm really excited to see what they do this year.  









 Expected this to be college basketball for some reason. Good on those kids. I feel like it takes more courage for middle schoolers to do this.  




 I loved Selma. Thought it was up there with Boyhood for my favorite movies of the year.  




 He always looks like it, then he gets hurt.  




 My brother is a young gay stylist. I can't wait until he's old.  




 Is downtown busy on Tuesday nights?  




 I'm obligated to drown my sorrows in /r/Kings.  




 Which is somewhat surprising because /r/49ers makes me want to drink bleach.  




 As others have pointed out, we probably wouldn't have won the WS in 2012 without him. Given that that was what he was brought here to do, I think most fans don't regret signing him, and that's just from a baseball perspective. He was one of the best people on the team while he was here.  




 Really hoping he does well. He deserves it.  




 That's too bad. Vernon Street has a lot of potential. I was just there and made a mental note to come back and check out Hagar's.

Nothing too out there, but I'm wearing the Old Navy slim fit OCBD that was featured on /r/frugalmalefashion last week. It fits well for a $22 shirt. The jeans are also Old Navy and I'm wearing beeswax CDBs.  




 *Pseudo*-intellectual assholes.  




 Joe Rogan wishes he was there to say, **"OOOHHHH!"** 




 Opera House Saloon does it on Wednesdays and The Station does it until 9 on Fridays.  




 He mad, bro. 




 Quick. Name 1 running back you would rather have than Marshawn Lynch with the ball on the one yard line.  




 There's no logical explanation for that call. You could argue that they were hoping to surprise NE with a pass, but that was the worst play call I can remember. There is no running back in the sport I would rather have in that situation than Marshawn Lynch.  




 In that situation, is there a single running back in the league you would rather have than Lynch? Why throw?  




 That tortoise just swooped on the hare's girl. Not cool... 




 Baldwin "mooned". NBC just won't show It. 




 Lol. Are we watching the same game?  




 Should we tell him guys?  




 Someone needs to give these mods a Snickers.  




 Nationwide taking the dead child approach to advertisement. That's a bold move. 




 Well that Nationwide commercial took a dark twist... 




 He's like a hybrid of Andre the Giant and Bubbles from Trailor Park Boys.  




 I guess you're just different like that :-) 




 Dude, you know he's not real, right?  




 Well, they did kill him after all... 




 SkinnyJew  




 Why is Lynch even there?  




 Trujillos or La Casita's?  




 OP deleted his comment. What was the bet?  




 Ecclesiastes 9:10

*Whatever job your hands finds to do, do it with all your might.* 




 The comment is deleted. What was the bet?  




 Check out /r/gainit. 




 Does Dolly Parton have any redeeming qualities?  




 How embarrassing for the team he's playing against... 




 Doctors say the baby came out with decent velocity and late break.  




 You think our religion is a *pseudo*-religion?  




 *I Can't Accept Not Trying* by Michael Jordan. It's out of print, but you can still get it through third party vendors on Amazon. It's short, but worth a read every once in a while.  




 Pseudo? 




 Maybe he was aiming for his arm and missed? Hard to believe a kid would just punch an adult like that.  




 WARNING! Don't read these comments if want to keep the magic.  




 If you go to a larger university, the gym probably offers rec classes that meet once or twice a week for a couple months. You can do anything from martial arts to ballroom dancing. It gives you a chance to try something new and meet new people. Also, go to club meetings. Universities have student organizations for just about everything.  




 Can someone explain the appeal of *Kid A*? I listen to it a couple times a year hoping I'll finally get it, but I just don't.  




 Check out [Lincoln Durham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9UYF043WBw feature=youtube_gdata_player). 




 This inexplicably makes me so happy.  




 My fourth grade teacher used to make me SQUIRT.  




 How long have you been gaining? For me, if I don't have meals planned out in advance, I start to stress about not hitting my caloric goals.  




 My New Year's Resolution is to listen to 3 new albums each week. Here what I've listened to so far: 


Prince - Dirty Mind

The Strokes - Is This It

Notorious B.I.G - Ready to Die

Modest Mouse - The Moon and Antarctica

Shovels and Rope - Swimmin' Time 

Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot

Bright Eyes - I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning 




 The thing about shower beer is people like to make it sound better than it really is. But, yes, you just take a shower like you normally would, but have a beer while you do it. I always find it takes me longer to finish a beer than it does to shower, so I'm left with a wet bottle. 5/10 




 Before each game, each team gives the referees 12 footballs. The Patriots use their 12 and the Colts use their 12, so each team uses different balls. An underinflated ball, while harder to throw a long ways, is easier to catch. It's easier to grip a ball that is underinflated and it will be less likely to bounce off of a receiver's pads.   




 That's interesting. OP claims to be in the US, but he's written some things that no one from here would say. He called college 'university'. He called an apartment a 'flat'. And he said Jenny's SIM card came out of her iPhone when she dropped it. My money is on this story being fake and it sounds like OP may be British pretending to be American.  




 Firstly, a PI isn't going to give live updates. Secondly, what phone has iMessage and a SIM card that will pop out when dropped on the ground?  




 In order for this to be true either (a) the PI is filming Jenny and Carly and Zach somehow has a live feed of it at home or (b) the PI is sending OP live updates. Neither option is how PIs work. This is fiction. 




 "SILVA'S HURT!" 




 Dancing is weird, because you don't really expect anyone to be good at it. The "best" dancers in a bar/club are the people who are the most confident in their moves.  




 Yup. Thought to myself, "I wonder what OP will say about Michael Vick."  




 I've heard people call this album a work of genius. I've heard it a couple times all the way through and, while it's a good album, I wouldn't call it outstanding. I'm curious what the rest of this subreddit thinks of it and can someone who loves it explain what makes it great to them?

 




 Someone should do an "essentials for a home bar" for every budget. It's easy to build a home bar when you're willing to put several hundred dollars into it. I would be more impressed with a guide on how to create an adequate home bar on $100.   




 You know how Facebook asks for places you've worked. He probably tried to write Cal Mart, it auto selected Kmart and now he thinks it's kmart's fault.  




 I remember who we played that day, but who did the Dodgers play? I don't recall. 




 I prefer the game played on September 12th.  




 That sounds like a bad rapper name.  




 M'Allah  




 My dad owned several Sizzler locations in the 80s and early 90s. What part of the country was this in?  




 I LOVE Little Hurricane. Unfortunately, they remind me of other, more popular artists like the White Stripes or Black Keys and I haven't come across anyone lesser known who remind me of them. When I saw them live, the opening act was Lincoln Durham. He's not the same musically, but I bet you would appreciate his work.  




 This is an outstanding comment. It's interesting that great movies like *Hotel Rwanda* and *Million Dollar Baby* aren't talked about as much as films like *Team America* and *Anchorman*, which are both, and I say this affectionately, stupid movies. 


Another interesting point you made is that children's movies seem to be talked about more. I think the question that neither you or OP asked is: Who is talking about these movies? Since most of Reddit tends to be in the 18-30 age range, it's not surprising that we still talk about the movies we liked when we were kids. *The Incredibles* still gets talked about, but is that because it's a great film or is it because we loved it when we were 12? My guess is that if Reddit had as many 30-40 year olds as it does 18-30 year olds, *The Incredibles* would not be mentioned as much as a film that that generation grew up with, *The Little Mermaid* for example. In 10 years, Redditors will probably talk about *Frozen* the same way we talk about *The Incredibles*.  




 This album was my introduction to Prince and after listening to it in its entirety, I wasn't impressed. I thought the vocals weren't loud enough and I couldn't make out what he was saying. But since it was the album that made Prince a star, I stuck with it and listened a few more times.


After a few listens, I fell in love with it. I live the catchiness, especially of the first two songs, *Dirty Mind* and *When you were Mine*, I love the thinly veiled (maybe blatant would be more accurate) sexual innuendo in the lyrics, and I even love Prince's high pitched vocals.  




 I was a big Jose Cruz fan as a kid.  




 Man, Keon Clark. That's an interesting story.  




 He gonna eat da poo poo?  




 As much as I want a great fight, I think JBJ Is going to outclass DC.  




 As if I could be any more excited for tonight.
