 He'll go. 




 What a great title.  




 The Grand Budapest Hotel - Museum Scene 




 I couldn't stop thinking about The Master for weeks. I must've rewatched that thing 7 times in fewer days. 




 He was once caught cheating on his wife via hidden camera, ironically.  




 /r/juxtaposition  




 Sister Christian - Boogie Nights 




 Holy shit that's awesome. 




 ...what? 




 Well Holy Toledo 




 Well, fuck. 




 For those who don't know, Paul George is really damn good. 




 Plus Michael didn't use a bow. So he cheated.  




 That movie is about happiness. 




 Em looks like a lesbian that hangs out at a slam poetry club 




 Oh no. Megan is Missing is such an atrocious movie. 




 She could do a reading of Mein Kampf and I'd doze off to it. 




 As much as I'd love that, it's not going to happen. Elba's already said it. 




 Good thing it's on wheat. Otherwise that'd be a bit much. 




 Chance

I can't think of anything Id wanna change 




 Anyone got a link to any videos of these moms straight up attacking a child in a skate park? I'm sure some exist somewhere. 




 I always thought that There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men could switch and still work nicely. What are other movies that work this way?

 




 I said it before, and I'll say it again. They should have gotten Mark Strong. He's an excellent actor who excels at playing an intimidating, stone-cold badass. Plus he's naturally bald, so that won't look weird.

 Hay now... 




 C'mon Jerry! The Dark Knight Returns! It's canon! 




 Paul Thomas Anderson is a huge fan of Sandler's early comedy movies, like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. That's apparently why he hired him. 




 Plus....all those goddamn puns. 




 I've seen the pilot. It's *fucking bad*, like they took some of Mulaney's jokes and ran them through 10 other FOX sitcom writers and a clich machine. 

The Big Bang Theory : Silicon Valley :: Mulaney : Curb Your Enthusiasm 




 Just fucking get Mark Strong. He plays a great, stone-cold badass and he's already got the perfect look.

 Which one's Obama? 




 :( 



























































 Too long, but I tried anyway. /r/noweby 




 Anyone have a link to whatever Gavin was talking about Dan fingering a sleeping girl? That shit sounds hilarious. 




 /r/conspiratard

No but really, you're looking too far into this. 




 [The Mattress Man commercial for PDL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkeLGisUHtc) 




 That's some good lookin money. 




 I don't necessarily disagree with you, but try and explain yourself rather than just laugh at people with other opinions. 




 Yeah, okay.  




 [Are you suggesting that Danny Trejo isn't a theatrical genius??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBYSqCSnr4) 




 That's exciting, Headhunters is phenomenal. 




 Danny Trejo chuckles in his face with 52 film credits from 2013-2014. 




 1 Day a year. Would the show just cover 1 day in the lives of different people? 




 I mean, we do have 24. 




 Ha

If you had said overrated I would've understood where you were coming from. I'm gonna need you to explain why you think it's bad. 




 I agree with some of these, but I don't understand how you can think that the Avengers is not overrated, but Inception is.

Then again, Robocop is your favorite movie. 




 Wow. This is the first opinion I've seen so far that's actually surprised me. Why? 




 I love the look of [Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes End Credits ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr2uPF83-m0)

And who could forget [Tom Cruise dancing at the end of Tropic Thunder?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srH94OR1TbU)
 




 I was thinking of Larry as I typed. 




 Who hates Caan? 




 I love Richard Linklater. I think he's a genius. His films are some of th e most unique and innovative I have ever seen.

^That ^being ^said, ^he ^should ^get ^a ^haircut. 




 This is going to be horrible. Sorry. 




 I get it. 




 Graduation over MBDTF? Huh. Alright. 




 She'll be buried with a grenade strung to the lid of the coffin ... ya know, in case of grave robbers. 




 That would have been amazing. And shaky. 




 Submarine and Moonrise Kingdom did a great job of making me grin like an idiot. 




 There's also Escape Plan and X2. That's all I got. Still, all of those movies are very recent, with the exception of Silence of the Lambs. It's becoming more prominently clich. 




 He should totally play Agent 47. 




 Not sure. But the fact he censored "Crap" is the icing on the cake. 




 Adding to that: A glass cell!

* Star Trek: Into Darkness
* Silence of the Lambs
* The Avengers
* Skyfall 




 I wouldn't say that's the most egregious use. 




 That was the last one.  




 Here's an old video of Michael's you might be interested in. [Nigga Clause!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54xjw7QIYA8 feature=player_detailpage list=UUoa_iR-oFUByUMGSZmTlzSw#t=31) 




 In The Loop
Michael Clayton
Ides of March
I'm assuming you've seen House of Cards. 




 Boogie Nights is great. If we're talking about original soundtracks, The Social Network or TGwtDT by Reznor. 









 /r/titlegore  




 Weird. I like it. 




 As for Enemy, I'm **extremely** arachnophobic as well. A few weeks back someone gave me a rundown of all scenes with spiders, and it doesn't seem like anything I couldn't handle. I'm watching it tomorrow.

 That is fucking awesome.
