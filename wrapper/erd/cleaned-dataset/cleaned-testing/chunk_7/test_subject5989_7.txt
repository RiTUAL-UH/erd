 I'm glad you got my reference lol. *DONG* 




 SHAME 




 I'm in love with what you've done here, congratulations!  




 My Birthday is July 28th and I've been fascinated with Astronomy for as long as I can remember :)  




 All females? Prove it! 




 Yeah I think I agree with you, as hard as it is to wait I probably should for the STi to release a new engine. I feel like that will be for the 2018 model though, *sigh* :( lol 




 I have tons of these all over the front roof of my car also. 14 impreza sport hb white. nothing you can do just buy the pen and fill er in 




 yeah I suppose, just a fan of leather, push to start, nav, sound system, spoiler. If I can get it already with all of that then less work for me. 




 Doesn't even HAVE to be STi wing, could always get something different I just see some wings costing a couple grand and definitely not spending that much on one lol 




 If I were to get a WRX why not fully loaded? It's not going to be able to compete with an STi so might as well have some comfort if I'm sacrificing not getting the STi lol
