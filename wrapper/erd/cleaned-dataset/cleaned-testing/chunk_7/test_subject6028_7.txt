 It's a figure of speech... 




 If by the audience you mean one dude, then sure 




 *bursts into tears* 




 But you are. Can I have your autograph?

Also, way to attack the one person defending you. Never meet your heroes, eh? 




 You know that's /u/billyK_, right? The dude is pretty fucking famous in this subreddit, so show a bit of respect. 




 yeah well we can't all have read Shaq's autobiography 36 times, dude 




 You're pure evil. 









 Nose doctor for those who don't know 




 ITT sweating RT superfans worrying about how the whole fanbase is perceived so they flame stuff like this even though they actually find it sorta kinda funny. Die Schutzstaffel.

 Maybe not James, but I think we could arrange a Lawrence and Joel collaboration 




 Yeah mate it just means Accident and Emergency. 




 Yeah, it just means Accident and Emergency. 




 Final Fantasy 7 spoiler at around 0:48 




 Shame they seem to bully Lawrence

  Same applies to Simon, who is currently battling with a condition which sent him to hospital and he's still recovering from.

Which condition?

 Everything is a joke.

 method acting 




 I mean, it depends on context 




 I'm taking the piss, I know that Double Dragon predates Sips/Lewis's channel 




 WWE Heavyweight champions, dubbed Double Dragon. 




 it's a prank, it's a prank, it's a prank 




 Ripping off Sips and Lewis?????????? 




 Yeah, it was. It's funny because OP is Jonnie Risinger 




  1. Submissions must be directly related to Rooster Teeth.

it was a joke ffs 




 so whats the story behind the Howard Stern joke? 




 Um, like 'test tube babies'? Or is it like surrogate mothers? 




 Excluding adoption, no, because that's not "having children", in the sense we are talking about 




 Nice, mate. How many runs did it take you? 




 How? 




 wait, how can your mom be a lesbian?

 Not sure why you've been downvoted, you are right.

 LE CLICKBAIT 




 I really enjoyed it. Thought that the premise was really cool, too. I would love to have the powers that Ig has. Also, [Lee Tourneau is an evil piece of shit, the chapters from his POV where he abuses his dying mum made me feel kinda sick](#s) 




 Objection 




 and ditching his m9s in the process, aye 




 Dude is a traitor anyway 




 TIL it isn't crying 




 I have the habit of buying books when I have a huge backlog to get through. 




 Awesome, thank you. 




 So, I've lost my "Asia Minor" allies. Sad times. Hopefully I can get Greece back...

Domestically, Newfoundland was annoying to invade for some reason, I rushed it I guess. And, of course, still stuck in the eternal stalemate with myself and my ally vs GAA. 




 I've not read To Kill a Mockingbird yet :( I should get on that. 




 Breakfast of Champions is on my to read list. Have you read many Vonnegut books? 




 Nice! I really want to get into Pratchett, was considering picking up Mort a few weeks ago but decided against it in the end. 









 Redditors, its like a combination of both 




 It's a dumb prank, sure. But punching someone over it seems like a bit of an overreaction 




 Hey you don't insult OP in his own fucking thread
