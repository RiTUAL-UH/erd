 Appreciate you making such a comprehensive post. Been interested in LC for sometime now, this is extremely helpful. 




 Would way rather have Moore. Gausman has proved nothing, probably one of these guys that will take another year or two to start putting it together  




 Nope, your trading the number 1 pick for like a 3rd rounder(8 man league). Pitching is replaceable, elite hitting isn't. Why does it have to be Felix? There's plenty of productive pitchers you can buy low on right now. Chris sale is probably going to dominate tonight, trade some schmo for him before his start. 









 This should be the top comment 




 Larry Johnson from KC 




 The NFL is an utterly spineless organization.  




 It's a great idea in theory, but once other teams start having their catchers lose time with injury they start dipping into the same pool as yours, and it can lead to frustrating waiver situations. 




 Ehh you lose in that one. Kemp isn't going to keep this up, he's bound to regress. And while Upton is great, he's a what, 2nd/3rd round pick this year where Kershaw was a 1st. Who are his other top hitters? 




 I like Souza 




 Wow intense offer. I wouldn't do it. Simply because it's a lot easier to replace pitching than elite hitting like that. Would he do Jones for Kershaw? 




 You win HUGE in this one. Take it before he comes to his senses. 




 I'd stick with Gattis 




 Thanks for doing this guys, like what I see on the site so far too.

In a Weekly league, 6x6 scoring. Who would your rather start?
Jonathon Niese @ CHC, CC Sabathia @TB @KC, Drew Hutchinson @ HOU, CJ Wilson vs COL, Yordano Ventura @ TEX 




 Wow this is a really tough one. Definitely a fair trade. I think beltre has the edge, I'd take it. 




 I think both of those are very fair trades, and good on you for not trying to make something terribly unbalanced. Not sure how Cozart could really qualify as a huge upgrade though, who's her SS? 




 Def neil walker. Rockies aren't going to be home at all this week they lose a lot of their appeal. Walker's batting 2nd in a pirates offense that's been heating up with mediocre pitching to face this week. 




 Too risky for me, I'd sit him. 




 Yeah I think you win in this.  




 Who are your other options? Archer's been good but yanks have been mashing and this start could unravel pretty quickly. 




 Paredes. Dickerson isn't going to be at home at all this week and that substantially downgrades his potential. 




 Yeah I think it's worth throwing Alvarez in there. RHP is how he makes his money, Pirates have been hot, and Williams isn't very good.

Yordano Ventura @ TEX 




 Stupid question, but is this a sunrise or sunset? 




 Familia, but you can't really go wrong here  




 Not really that bad. As a yankee fan selling high on big tex was a great move. Injuries will be inevitable with him this year and he has much regression to look forward to.

EDIT: spelling 




 Hisashi all day baby 




 You're not wrong in your assesment, just be aware this guy is a bigger con-man than Bernie Madoff. Once you feel like you can trust him he'll completely implode and ruin your overall stats.

-Someone who's not at all bitter. 




 Gotta go devon travis. He's been raking and is batting in the best offense in baseball. 




 It's more fun taking risks and having them pay off than playing it safe. Facing a high octane offense and one of the best pitchers in the league? Sure, but fuck it this guy is 5'7" and can throw a 103mph fastball. 




 Back to his normal shenanigans 




 Seeing a lot on almond flour, would like to know your thoughts on that and any other alternatives 




 Takes guys a while to adjust...I think it's worth holding. Surprised no one wants him, I've been trying to buy low and the owner won't budge. 




 Who else is available at SS? 




 Yeah it's not like you'd even have to hold him very long before you found out his diagnosis. 




 Oh dear 




 You could get Tanaka for next to nothing right now. While you take on all of his risk, you could also have another Ace in your rotation for the rest of the year. 




 You could get an RSS feed app and get an update everytime your players name pops up into google news 




 I'd say D'Arnaud. Because he's on my team and I want him to do well. 




 How in god's name do you have Alexei starting in an 8 team league?

EDIT: Sorry, to answer I'd choose Correa, Buxton is probably gonna be called up way late. 




 Vetoes should be removed from the league system. Commissioner should have sole discretion and only block a trade if there's collusion. 




 Meh I'd drop Murphy for him. Who else is available? 




 Haven't tried it. Honestly Draft is the most fun I've had with dailies, highly recommend. 




 Stanton is older, doesn't steal as many bases, and hits for lower average. Trout is at the top in all categories and more importantly does it consistently. Stanton is way more prone to slumps, and doesn't have Albert Pujols hitting behind him. 




 To buy-low or to avoid.... 




 From what I've read the issue is more with the Angels manager who isn't so much interested in playing the most offensive capable catcher. It makes sense, but bad news for Carlos. That being said I'm unaware how talented he is as far as calling a good game.

EDIT: spelling 




 Good move on your part 




 Yeah, I honestly just wouldn't trade him in a dynasty unless it was an utterly unbalanced offer. Not only does trout have the highest ceiling but he has the most consistency, there are never question marks surrounding him, truly one of a kind.

 Anyone available on waivers? 




 Depends who you're dropping for him, but most likely yes, could be a great bat to have on the bench. Definitely yes if you're in a daily league since you can leverage his matchups a lot more effectively. 




 http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Greg+holland 




 Do it 




 I'd say Aoki's a great choice, after him Fowler. 




 74.2% 




 Yes, drop him, I'd rather own cozart 




 I'm in a similar league and am holding. Will probably wait to see by June. Wouldn't be surprised if he has to do a 15 day DL stint at some point. Probably depends how many bench spots you have. 




 If Saturday's fight was considered a boring, defensive battle, how can I watch an exciting heavyweight match?

I'm a noob to this, would love to get into boxing, just would like to watch more aggressive fighters that are in their prime.  




 Lester 




 Can you expand on why you consider Miller one of the better hitters? I get that there's high expectations for him each season but his end of year stats always end up being a disappointment, so far it looks like more of the same for 2015. 




 Definitely, wouldn't be surprised if was owned 100% by the end of the season 




 Honestly I'd try to sell high on him in a few weeks. Not to be a Debbie downer but high altitude play wears the body down, I'm doubtful he'll so healthy come July.

EDIT: ...I'm dumb. Thought it was Cargo we were talkin about-  




 Yeah I'd trade him. His power isn't coming back. He'll hit for good average and probably get a career high in doubles, but don't expect anything better than last year. Look him up on fangraphs, he's getting older and his peripherals tell the same story. 




 Alex Wood. Surprised he's not being mentioned here. Off to a rough start but he'll finish the year better than everyone's precious Carrasco.
