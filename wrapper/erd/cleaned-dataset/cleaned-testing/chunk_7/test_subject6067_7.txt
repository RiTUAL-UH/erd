 We'll just sit here and watch the other people and see what they do... 




 soooo muchhhh sodiummmmm  




 Tons of really amazing Asian food places within walking distance.  Downside... lots of Asian drivers :(.  FYI I'm Asian and even I know that driving around here is more defensive than anything else lol. 




 Currently using MyFitnessPal but this app looks more sleek.  I'm really excited to try this out! 




 Those eyes, the floppy ears, the paws... can't handle the cuteness overloaddddddd 




 Oh my... the font choices... 




 Ehhhh that's terrible.  Poop awayyyy!!! 




 I like how your first reaction was to shit on their car... lol 




 Great photo!  Thanks for sharing it :) 




 Throw on a piece of pineapple and call it a Hawaiian taco! 




 I've stopped there a few times and never noticed the baklava milkshakeeeee!  That sounds delicious! 




 Soooo deliciousssss.  Their matzo ball soup is amazing as well. 




 Drove from Miami to Key West and it seemed like 1/2 the houses had these.  Love them :) 




 This movie made me so sad and angry at the same timeeeeee!!! The rage, the tears!! 




 I think it's cause he is so confident around women that it takes them by surprise.  He also does have a nice voice and I bet he knows how to sweet talk.  I don't think he's ugly, but he definitely gets hotter women than you'd expect. 




 :( a day of suffering and cringe moments have given you an awesome story to tell.  If you can survive that, you can survive anything :D  




 Lol lol I wasn't upset at her when she wore the same color.  I felt more bad  for her cause people noticed.  It also didn't help that it was the first time I'd seen her.... so I didn't know who this extra bridesmaid was lol.  I can't imagine how badly you must had felt.  Good thing something always goes wrong at weddings so hopefully your crime wasn't the worst.   




 Lol that happened to me at my wedding.  My husband's friend brought his girlfriend (without telling us) and she showed up in a dress that was the same color as my bridesmaids.  She sort of hid from us the whole day lol.   




 agreed.. this really was a very sad sad photo... lol 




 Loved the video! It was food porn at it's finest.  Great choice in music as well.  I was hungry and relaxed both at the same time...hahahah 




 I never realized that her eyes and nose reminded me so much of Kristen Bell!   




 I will try this recipe this weekend! 




 Hi guys!  I love chewy chocolate chip cookies but I can't seem to find the perfect recipe.  I've tried Alton Brown's the chewy, the NY Times recipe, and a few others.  I love chewy cookies that are almost like a macaron. Any help would be appreciated! 




 When I'm in an elevator at night I sometimes still think about it.  Sooo freaken scaryyyy 




 I know the whole thing sounds so strange, but I'm definitely not drinking or have anxiety about flying.  The worst thing flight I've had was from LA to Denver.  Then it took 5 days before I felt better :(. I'm not sure about dehydration, but maybe I should drink more water the day before flying. This whole thing is just such a mystery and I haven't met anyone else that have had this problem. 




 I've never seen a doctor for this because I've always assumed that altitude sickness pills were only prescribed to patience going to places with high altitude and not just for plane flights. I really want to travel more but being sick on the plane is seriously no fun :( 




 I'm actually not afraid of flying and even though I dry heave, I'm not actually nauseous.  I've tried to suck on ginger candies but the dry heaving doesn't go away.  I've tried taking Bonine but it didn't help either.  One time I took NyQuil which helped me fall asleep, but after 2 hours I woke up with the same symptoms plus body aches :( 




 I've gotten altitude sickness the last 4 times I've flown.  The first 30 minutes I'm completely fine.  Then after about an hour I find myself dry heaving and breathing fast the rest of the flight.  I don't know what to do.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated :D  Thank you. 




 The crust on the cheese steak reminds me of a fig newton...  




 I can just imagine a bunch of redditors trekking through Koreatown in search of the mountains lol :D 




 I like Popeyes better... hahahaha 




 Yeah I can imagine! With multiple layers, it might end up being more like a lash tint.  




 I love to use Mango Butter and Shea Butter in all of my soap recipes.  The combination of the 2 give a great feel to the bar itself as well as the lather :D 




 I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil. 




 Thank you so much for your detailed review!! It seems to do a great job lengthening.  I wonder if it would be even thicker if you applied more coats.  Then again it may never come off hahahah.  Thank you again! 









 Your blog is great!  That carrot cake looks delicious :) 









 Hey guys!  My blog posts are mainly travel photos but I also have a few recipes and photos of my handmade soap.  Take a look at my blog and let me know if anyone wants to do a guest blog with me :D http://www.test_subject6067.com
