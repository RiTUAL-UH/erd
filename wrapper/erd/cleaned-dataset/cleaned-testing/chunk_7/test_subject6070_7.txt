 I would crack up if my kids built catapults. Sound like a fun teacher  




 It really does! my students and I had a long conversation about it the other day after class and few of them said they would try to vegetarian for a couple weeks and see how it goes. Never preached about it just lead by example and answered their questions  




 We had a swing set with a little platform that you climbed up so you could go down the slide. I used to sit up there and play with my toys. About twice a month I would fall off backwards (5feet) and get the wind knocked out of me. I still can't explain how I always feel off of this thing. 




 I just made this mistake I am all red and broken out. Do you have any suggestions to help my skin heal? 




 I think it is a Scottish fold cat 




 Take a cotton ball with viniger to it  that should help break down the glue 




 Damn and here I was feeling bad that I only see my SO every three weeks. I am sorry for your loss of dick my dear. 




 I live in the southern US and sandals are completely acceptable (and considered professional) as long as they aren't flip flops.  




 This is some frank underwood shit 




 Bus boys typically get tipped out by servers so yeah it would be cheaper to have bus boys , but fun to have dogs 




 It was pretty much like bartending anywhere else except I wore a corset.  




 It was kind of a kink themed club  




 I agree with you I try to eat healthy but tofurky and vegan cheese are great to have around when I just want to make a sandwich for lunch. I recently moved close to a grocery store that has tons a lot of  vegan options and it makes staying vegan so much easier. 




 I actually used to bartend at a club called restraint. So yes. 




 Yes ,thank you that is what I meant to say . it was early and I was on my mobile. But yeah bus boy dogs would be awesome!  




 What of instead of bus boys, restaurants just had trained  dogs you fed scraps to, and then they took the plates back to the dish washer.
Edit spelling and stuff 




 There is no pain quite like "I spent an entire class on this and you still didn't get it" pain. I feel for you. 




 Same thing happened to me had to get off the stuff . I called it orthotripsyco. 




 It takes a couple shark weeks to get the hang of it but I have been a convert for 2 years now and I love it! Good luck. 




 I have a huge book of page protectors and everyone contains everything I used when I taught the lesson the year before and if something didn't work well or I thought of something better to do I write it on the front of the notes for the day. Works well for me.  




 The miseducation of Lauren Hill...one of the few albums I bought new and still listen to regularly. I love every damn song 




 I play an instrument 




 Hanks or coast have great seafood fleet landing is OK hymans is a tourist trap 




 The part of the brain that controls your feet is beside the part of the brain that controls sexual attraction ...just something to think about.
Actually my psyc professor told me this I have never looked to see if it is actually true. 




 I worked while I student taught and it was awful but it is possible. Do as much on the weekends for your job as possible because you will likely be too tired during the week. Let your mentor teacher know you are working . I also took out a small additional student loan so that I could cut back to 15 hours a week every other week which helped me not feel so burnt out. 




 I won teacher of the year as a second year high school teacher. 




 Are you talking about primary sources? I am a little confused about what expository writing means. Reading like a historian has great lesson plans for US and world  history. Hope that is helpful. 




 I am nearing the end of my second year and I am starting to have more of a life work balance my friend who are in their 3rd and 4th years say they do very little at home. 




 I too can go without oral and enjoy other types of sex and my bf is very good at it. I just don't enjoy being eaten out that much. Bet your man feels the same way fuck the internet sometimes. 




 If you do this I think it would be great if you did it kind of like crash course and had different videos for different teachers. Like teachertube secondary teachertube middle and teachertube elementary. I would have loved this my first year ! Let us know how it goes 




 I interviewed for jobs in Asia a couple years ago before taking a job in the states. a couple questions that were different from standard teacher interview questions  were how do you plan to adjust to culture shock? How would you handle language barriers with children? How long do you intend to stay in the country?  Everything else seemed pretty standard I was offered the job but decided to stay in the states. 




 What subject are you interviewing for? 




 Ginger dread man 




 Not a sex Ed teacher but a high school teacher one of my students had heard that if you took ear wax from your ear and put it near a girls vagina that if she had an std she would pull away from it and if she didn't she wouldn't move. He wanted to know if this was true ...I asked him to repeat the question like three times because I couldn't believe how dumb it was. I informed him of the many ways to test for STDs and that was not one of them.  




 I didn't tell her it was me because I didn't want to start crying . I told her that I would pass the message a long to the right person and thanked her for calling to let us know she was doing better.
