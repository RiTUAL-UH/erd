 Liz Lemon is fighting the Nazis?  




 I once drank vanilla extract when I was 10 and I was so upset and sick  




 Not necessarily a teacher, but the president of my university awarded me scholarships even though I didn't apply for them. 3 times. 









 You could hear me well "go back to Texas" to Arod at a Yankees game in 2005(?) on ESPN 




 30 Rock and 3rd Rock from the Sun 




 I guess I sell brands and dannon's danimal yogurt  




 They know something  




 Good point! 




 I've been binge watching 3rd Rock from the Sun on Netflix and it got me wondering about this 




 I'll be majoring in either History or Psychology.   




 I'll be transferring from a 2 year to a 4 year soon and I'm wondering if the top universities are actually worth the cost. The only advice I've gotten so far is from 1 person and she has told me that I should go to a state school and then go to a top university for my post grad degrees. In my situation cost isn't that big of a deal.  




 So I'm stuck to sleep over at someone's house tonight. Was stuck last night too. Had to sleep on the floor. So my roommate and I were leaving work and he was driving, he didn't say anything about us going to his friend's house again. I was planning on taking a nice shower and making some BBQ chicken for dinner. So now I haven't eaten in several hours, I feel gross and Im exhausted. I also get to look forward to sleeping on the floor again tonight and possibly not eating until the morning. Also going to work in the same clothes, unshowered, teeth unbrushed and phone dead. I would've love to have at least been told that this would be happening tonight. I mean what the hell bro.  




 Beautiful.  




 Is your brother Vali, the 30 Rock writer? 









 I just wanna add that instead of Mathway I use Cymath because it gives you step by step for free. I'm not sure if they have an app though  




 You're looking good and a lot happier man keep up the solid work!  




 I see it too and it's pretty creepy looking  




 Considering how deliberate the trip was and Reus was without the ball... it was very bad. 




 I dropped my phone 3 times watching this gif. There's no way I would be able to hang from there 




 This local Chinese buffet banned sugar packets from being on the tables because I poured a few packets in a cup then got a refill of Pepsi and it exploded on the waitress. 




 No problem, I mean my only experience is having taken art history classes, but that's what helped me do well.  




 It's hard to tell what's tongue in cheek on the internet lol. Yeah that was bad. Hacking the stock market if possible would be damaging to the economy as well. Also one persons voice can unite millions. If there was someone with the goal of terrorizing become popular and then using those people to act out terror then that would be bad too. 




 Yeah those are actually very crippling. In my opinion though, on second thought, something that maybe wouldn't kill anyone, but really cripple the moral of people would be harsh too. 




 Nothin' 




 Larry David. His complaining would keep me entertained. 




 Attack the nuclear power plant in my region. Takes out power, workers and of course the nuclear aspect would be horrifying.  




 Know the style of art your critiquing and know the history of the style.  




 One of the Pokemon games, in pretty sure it was Silver or Gold. What I remember most was getting frustrated that Hoothoot kept fighting me. It wasn't my game, but my brothers friend's game. I picked up where he had left off (right after picking the first pokemon) and this is also the first time I ever got mad because of a video game.  









 I currently work at Lowe's and it's insane how some of these things get by associates. It makes me wonder how many times I've been tricked.  









 West Ham United 1 - 3 Manchester United 

Van Persie, Di Maria, Rooney

 The DVDs have them. They're the only place I've seen them.  




 The only place I've found them is on the DVDs 




 So what's some high grade chocolate I should try?  




 Manchester United 4 - 0 Leicester City 

Falcao, Falcao, Mata, Rooney

 That says "will" not "may" 




 So we should organize something to get him an English girlfriend?  




 Sounds like the mob 




 YES! It's Al Di La! Thank you so much! 




 Okay so I realize that this will be very tough to figure out considering the abundance of italian places in Brooklyn. I recently went on a trip to Brooklyn and we were taken to a very small and nice italian restaurant. Unfortunately I can't ask the person that took us to the place. So I'll try to narrow it down with the details I know of. Okay so the waitresses there all wore black and white stripes and had red bows or something around their neck. They served water in a tall green bottle. The menu was all in italian. It's also only a few blocks from the Barclays center and farther from the water than it. Now that's all I can think of. I'm really sorry. I can't even remember the name of the street it was on, normally I'm good at remembering names, but this slipped by mind.  




 I DONT CARE IF THIS IS REAL OR FAKE WHENS THE NEXT UPDATE
