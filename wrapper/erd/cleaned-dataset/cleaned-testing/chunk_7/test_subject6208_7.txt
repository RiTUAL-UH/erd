 Oh on the disk it had "18" on it so I just assumed. But that's good news  



















 I went to see them last October and before the show, we went to some stores. The sales associate who was in her twenties asked if we were going to the show. We said yes and she said "They're awesome! They did a really great cover of a Johnny Cash song." 




 This is my first post here and I wanted some feedback. Don't mind the numbering of the paragraphs. Those are for a personal purpose.

[Here it is](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B54RInQXb2CRU1BGSXJ6OFd6TEU/edit?usp=sharing)

Also, I wouldn't mind some title advice as well. NDE is a working one.

Thanks in advance for any advice/critiques! 




 Obviously District 9.  




 King Leonidas' [death scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj11Pj2T7Bw) in 300. It's so beautiful and tragic. His whole life he had been taught to not fear death, but in this moment he realizes what he'll be leaving behind. His love. And for the first time in his life, he feared death.

"My queen! M-my wife. My love."

Edit: Also wanted to add that it's beautifully shot and beautifully acted by Gerard Butler.  




 Weird question, I know, but I don't drink and also happen to be a non-alcoholic drink enthusiast if that's even a thing. 

I'm looking for places in or around Memphis that have good/interesting/unique/strange drinks. Sodas, juices, whatever as long as it's non-alcoholic. 

A strange request, but I'd love some info.

 She was wearing a blue bikini I think? Also the background had a playboy symbol.  




 Max Payne 




 I think this might be the right answer. People hear Adam Sandler and they think over the top comedy. You go see Punch Drunk Love and it's Sandler actually acting against PTA's great, but unusual directing, and when you combine this with the strange story, it's easy to see people not liking it because it's not what they think. 




 One of my all time favorites. I seriously think it's one of the best movies ever made. 




 I watched it recently and it still kind of holds up well. Especially the Island of Lost Dreams one. 




 The 3 kinds of comments in this post:

"Fuck Gamestop" Yeah yeah we've heard it all before. 

"This is why I pirate games. Because I'm sending a message to the man!" No it's not. You pirate because you'd rather get something for free. 

And finally, "This should be in the game. I bet it was but they just took it out." You should not be surprised and should expect this by now. I'm with you in that it sucks, but this is normal now. In fact it's weird if games don't have preorder bonuses now.  




 Only two kinds of people use the word "rubbish". British people and snobs. I hope you're British.  




 Niell Blomkamp 




 That show is fantastic! I've been waiting for season 5 to show up on netflix 




 Watching my youtube subs is a nightly thing with me. I have netflix, but I don't watch it as much as I want to.  




 I have the [Nine Inch Nails logo](http://i.imgur.com/d57qOpn.jpg) on my finger. I like it because it's not really noticeable and it's my favorite band. 




 I miss my senior year of high school. Best time of my life. I was happy, I got to see my friends everyday, I didn't have bills or responsibilities. All I worried about was how I was going to make the next day fun.

I also had this film class. I miss that because I got to make short films with my best friends. 

I think I just miss my friends. Once I graduated, I only stayed in contact with like three of my friends and I only got to see them like once every week or two.

But yeah, I just really miss my senior year. Great friends, great teachers, classes, and a great, happy life. 




 I'll just get on Youtube. Like tonight I spent hours watching live performances of bands. It was great. Sometimes I'll just listen to a podcast while pacing around the house. 









 It's from a Korean Company called Plain Archive. To me it's like the Korean Criterion. They take certain movies and give them really great artwork and stuff. 

They do it every couple of months. But unfortunately they sell out fast. The newest one, Blue is the Warmest Color, sold out in ten minutes. If you want to stay up to date on what they're doing and new releases, I recommend following them on Facebook.  




 Under the Skin 














 "The finest cigars, the finest wine, and a .22 cal gun."

Not bad. 
 




 Naw this chick was I think Korean? She also appeared to be on a train 




 It's a short video too. Help? 




 Recently I've been thinking Brandon Routh would be pretty good.  




 I kind of hope it's more Avengers/Guardians in tone and not Xmen. Power Rangers is awesome but there's always been this fun cheesiness to it.  




 He's one of the few directors that puts a lot of work into the writing and characters

His movies are shot really well. The composition is great and there's just something about the lighting in his films. The camera work is also always great.

His writing may be self indulgent, but it is always sharp and smart. His movies are some of the few that I actually enjoy listening to just as much as watching. He makes pretty entrancing conversations between characters that really hold your attention.

I think he does a good job of pacing a story even if it is long. He knows how to move a story forward.

His films have good consistency. I don't mean his films are consistent with each other, but his films by themselves are consistent in tone.

I personally don't find his movies boring, though I can see how someone would. He makes entertaining movies that almost always have some sort of fun quality to them. 

I find him to be sort of a breath of fresh air. He only makes movies like once every couple or so years. He actually takes some time to makes sure that it's quality work. Yeah, not all of his films are perfect, but I think he still makes above average films consistently. And I do think there is some nice uniqueness to his films. Even if it's something we've seen before he manages to find a way to turn it into something different. 









 You should get The Thin Red Line and Tree of Life on blu-ray. Some of the best looking blu-rays out there. 




 Goodfellas is not as good as everyone says it is. It's a good movie, but definitely not as remarkable as people say. I have a hard time considering it to be in Scorsese's top 5.

Gravity, aside from its technicals aspects, is incredibly bland. In fact, it's pretty below average.

The Rock is not the best action movie ever. Not even close.

The Godfather is boring.

I think Terrence Malick is one of the greatest directors of all time.

I think The Tree of Life is one of the best movies ever made.

I think The Matrix Reloaded is awesome and not terrible. It's still a cut above most movies that come out today.

I think The Dark Knight is one of the best crime movies since Heat.

Only God Forgives was one of the best movies not only of 2013, but of the decade as well. 




 Romeo+Juliet is a national treasure!

Also, while I think a movie can be great with a simple plot, I think Gravity instead just had an incredibly flat, thin plot. The movie is a technical marvel, but that's where the good stops. At least for me it does. 




 But....Raging Bull.... 




 In terms of the "new" Bond films, it doesn't hold up against Casino Royale. 




 I personally think Punch Drunk Love is the best PTA movie.

Also, the piano/Brittany Spears scene is probably one of the best scenes from a film in the past decade.  




 That doesn't really make them wrong though. He's a good director and Pulp Fiction *is* kind of a good movie. This sounds more like the mindset, "It's popular so it's bad/you don't really know anything about film." 




 I can most definitely say he's one of my favorite directors and I could totally give some legit reasons. 




 Dancer in the Dark is so sick though. At least to me it is. 




 So just for clarity, are you saying that every Kubrick movie besides Strangelove is terrible or Kubrick has made some good films but Strangelove is the best? 




 So what does karma *do* in fallout? I've always had good karma in fallout, so I don't know how bad karma affects the game. 




 Yep, high speech in NV will get you through, and out of, so many things. Definitely makes life easier. 




 When I played Fallout 3, I had never played a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game. So in Fallout, I had no idea you could just wait. It made playing so tedious because I had to just wander around until daytime in order to go to stores and stuff.

In NV I went into the quarry after playing for only like two hours.

Also, repair is the best skill and I don't know how I could have gotten through that game the first time without it. 




 I think the last time he played a character that was different from what he usually does was Coach Carter 




 Bigger stars have started in worse movies.  




 Yep it's like a private screening! 




 Unlock the open blue sports coat you get at level 14. I wanted a sweet blue suit. Once I got it, I was kinda done with online. 




 I really want to say Only God Forgives, though I can't figure out why. There's just something about it. I can totally see it being a classic in 40 years. 




 I can't speak for everyone, but what made it great for me was the theme of fathers and sons. I have a close relationship with my father and this movie really got to me emotionally. I also really loved the fact that it felt like a Greek tragedy play with its clear three act structure. I can totally see people not liking it though. I thought the reveal of what happens to Gosling's character was a great twist I didn't see coming. 

I don't know if it will be considered a classic, but it will always be one of my all time favorites.  




 1. The Raid 2

2. The Rover

3. Under the Skin

4. 22 Jump Street

5. Grand Budapest Hotel 




 Yeah, we live in a day and age where everyone is so cynical about everything. We always assume the worst when people do or say nice things. Not everyone is trying to say something or be passive aggressive. Sure, some people are like that, but there are also people who just like being nice and helpful. There doesn't always have to be something someone is trying to get out of you by being nice.  




 I mean, don't most parents want their daughter(s) to get married and have kids anyway? I don't see how them being Mormon has much to do with that. I mean, yeah, Mormons are big about families and think its important to have one, but I feel this doesn't have that much to do with them being Mormon. It just seems like they are really pushy and happen to be Mormon as well. I mean I know plenty of people like that. Hell, my parents do the same thing with my older sister and we're not Mormon. 




 It had to do with a fox. Like all the games had this fox character and it was a series of mini games, and one mini game was keeping bubbles in the air and not letting them touch the ground. 









 I think it's awesome that we can still get movies featuring an actor who has passed.  




 I have a drumstick that was used and signed by the drummer of M83. After the final song he signed the drumstick and threw it in the crowd. It's all cracked and stuff. They may not be the biggest band but they are one of my favorite bands so it's really cool to me.  




 I think it just depends. I love working on films and tv shows. Started as a hobby then I worked for a production company for five years and loved every day of it.  




 The Raid 2 









 Context? 




 I honestly think you should see it for yourself. It's been pretty divisive. I've heard some call it one of the worst movies they've seen, and some call it one of the best. I guess it all depends on what *you* want out of a movie, and what you're looking for in one. Just make sure you set your expectations right for what it is. Know what you're getting yourself in to. If you go into it thinking it will be a post apocalyptic sci-fi action movie, you'll have a bad time. It's a drama that is set upon the backdrop of the post apocalypse and it takes its time.  




 The thing that makes Robert's performance great is that there is so much subtlety in his portrayal of his character. There's so many little things he does that make it fantastic. It's not some bombastic performance full of expressed emotion. He says so much with his expressions and mannerisms.  




 I honestly think he stole the show. Which isn't easy to do when you're co staring with other great actors. I always wanted him to be great because I knew he had the capacity to be a great actor. He really showed what he could do. One of the best, if not the best, performance by an actor so far this year.  




 Just saw The Rover last Friday and it might be my new favorite movie of the past decade.

If not that then No Country for Old Men. It's one of the few movies that is almost perfect in every aspect.

The Raid 2 is also close to being number one.

The Tree of Life is probably the movie that affected me the most emotionally the past decade.

Man, there's just too many. 




 I wish there was an option like in the Skate games where you can set a checkpoint. I'd set one on top of Chilliad and ride down it all day.  




 Yeah, I remember reading that during the uprising scene, when something messed up, they had to spend almost an entire day resetting things.  




 Tron Legacy was not only gorgeous, but had a killer score as well. Probably one of the best scores of the past decade. 




 That and the music 









 Matrix bullet time on the roof. I saw that and my jaw dropped. I had never seen anything like it at the time. 




 I have a legitimate question though. Doesn't that small percent become irrelevant if you live in an area where one of those deadly spiders live? Like doesn't the probability of encountering a deadly spider increase if you live in the native area of it? I feel like .0015% *is* insanely small, but I live in an area where brown recluses and black widows are the norm, so that small percent means nothing to someone like me. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWM4dFRc9Y 




 Right [here!](http://www.hexmedia.tv/) 









 Yeah, I think he needs some time for people to forget about him so when he comes back we'll all be like, "Oh yeah! I forgot about him!" 

Maybe time will heal and we'll forget his past. I mean people kind of forget about Robert Downy Jr's past now that he's a mega star. Then you think about it and go, "Oh yeah, he was super messed up and everyone thought he was going to end up dead."

Shia just needs to pull a Robert Downy Jr 




 Oh wow I have your autograph! Neat! I'm super excited to see it. I've been holding off watching it until tonight because some friends and I are having a scary movie night and my friends little brother will be there so I'm happy we'll all get to see it! 




 The movie was panned by most people and critics but I think it gets massive points for its creativity and originality. I love it! 




 Blue Valentine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=f4IN6NFukF0#t=67 




 From 12 Years a Slave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=lAHReSSV1IA#t=118

Strong runner up from Shame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE2NuKD-U4g 




 No I think he's a really good actor too, but he totally has the capacity to be a *great* actor. Look at A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints as an example. He did amazing in that. I think all Shia needs to do is completely disappear from movies and the public eye for like 5 years. Then come out of nowhere with a movie that has a great script and director behind it. 




 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2367066/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1

I was wondering if anyone who's seen it could tell me about the content in there and how much sex, violence, and language there is. Like is it all pretty pg-13 or more R?

Friends and I are having a scary movie night and I want to watch this but his little bro who is 14 will be there also and I don't want to bring something filled with gore, sex, or f bombs.  




 Those lance explosions were just so visually satisfying. 




 Who makes them? Is there a company? Are they given the entire movie to choose footage from or are they given specific clips? How involved is the director? Are they story boarded? Who decides tone?

I just really am interested in the process because I've always wondered.  




 I wouldn't call Martyrs a horror. More like a drama where horrific things happen. It's not really scary, just sad and depressing. 




 The [Matrix Revisited](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295432/?ref_=nv_sr_3) is like a two hour documentary on the making of the Matrix. Really really in depth.

And if you're in to behind the scenes stuff, I highly recommend getting the Ultimate Matrix Collection. It has 35 hours of behind the scenes stuff. 














 Take a movie and switch the perspective of it. What movie would be interesting to see from the perspective of one of the other characters in it?  




 I'm actually pretty excited about this game. I'm not the biggest fan of Battlefield as a series, but the idea of taking a game like Battlefield which, despite its apparent glitches, is for the most part technically impressive and then putting that into an urban environment with police sounds interesting. 

Battlefield for me has been a lot of the same recently. I think it's a cool idea to make a swat game.  




 No Country for Old Men

I think it's one of the few movies that is technically perfect in almost every single way. The writing is great. The cinematography, the acting, directing, sound design, and editing are all near perfect. 

It also has a great simple yet deep story and characters. It's also an incredibly well paced film. It never drags. It always feels so tense and so tightly done.  




 Right at Your Door is a terrible movie.  




 Man, Ivan Ooze is a great villain. He had some great lines. 




 Same here. He got a girlfriend, they got engaged, then moved in together. When you have someone around all the time you apparently don't need anyone else.  




 So how does a video rental place help me? Genuinely curious, not sarcastic 




 What's black lodge 




 I posted a couple of weeks ago about needing one actor and one actress for a short. I got an overwhelming response from the guys, which is great, but no actresses. 

Are there any local communities or organizations where I can reliably find an actress? We start shooting very soon and have found our guy but need our girl. That's all that's left for us to do before shooting.  




 I feel like the Matrix doesn't fall into this category. It's pretty much clear to the characters thirty minutes in what's real and not real.  




 I might have worded that weird, but at work today a bunch of ink spilled all over the laminate flooring. After spending hours scrubbing the floor is still stained. 

I look at my hands and see they are covered in ink. I think to myself, "Oh great, I'll be cleaning my hands forever." But to my surprise my hands were rid of any trace of ink after washing my hands for like 2 minutes. 

So what makes skin hard to stain? Why was this ink so easy to clean off my hands but impossible to clean off the floor? Did it have to do with skin, the ink, or the laminate flooring? Regardless of whether this has to do with the material of the flooring or not, my question still stands: What makes skin so hard to stain and all around resilient and resistant? 




 This very thing happened to me in the Sims 3 




 I disagree. Even though Avatar wasn't the best movie, I loved the world and universe they built. And I'm excited to see more of this universe. Apparently one of them is suppose to be about the oceans of Pandora which could turn out awesome.  




 I'm currently waiting for mine as well as the Wrestler in the mail and I'm so ready for it to get here.

Also, Art of Flight bluray. Nice. 




 I work a very physical job where the dress code is pretty lax. All we need our uniform polo and just some jeans that aren't messy. However I find working a physically demanding job in jeans not comfortable. I jokingly said to my boss, "What if I found sweatpants that looked like jeans?" to which he replied, "If they look like jeans then whatever." 




 I don't? 




 Are jean sweatpants a valid option? 




 No no I mean like a bank heist movie. I want a full movie like the Dark Knight opening. It was so entrancing to watch that opening scene. Take that, then give us a huge section of them setting it up and then pulling it off.

Edit: Sorry for my opinion? 




 That movie still holds up pretty well effects wise 




 I'm waiting for a Nolan heist movie.  




 So this pair of jeans I've had for like 2 months have just ripped. I guess from being worn out. Are there a brand of jeans that are pretty durable and will last and won't ware out or rip easily? 




 The boat reminds me of the one from Never Let Me Go 




 There are only 5 games that would get me truly excited for this new generation. Of course they may announce new IPs as well.

Skate 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)

Rock Band 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)

The next Elder Scrolls game (which doesn't seem likely)

Fallout 4 (Which could happen)

and Red Dead Redemption sequel (which who knows)

I'm just kind of not interested in really any of the already announced games. I really REALLY hope there are a good amount of surprises and new ip reveals this E3 and it isn't just more of what we have already seen. 

I haven't gotten a new console yet because I'm just waiting for that game that will make me say, "Okay, I *need* to get a new console." So far, none of the already announced games have made me say that.  




 Gatsby. Ain't no party like a Jay Gatsby party cause a Jay Gatsby party don't stop? 




 Exactly. Immersion is very powerful. My cousin served a mission in Brazil. He study Portuguese for like three weeks then left for Brazil. Didn't take him long to adapt to the language.  




 I told the people I work with that I went skydiving with my long term girlfriend who loves me. 

My coworkers now think I'm a very cool adventurous guy. I've never been skydiving and don't have a girlfriend. I'm very lame, boring, and single. It's nice having people think I'm cool for a change.  




 I was driving to work on a very rainy day. Like it was hard rain where you could hardly see anything in front of you. 

It was a four lane highway and a guy driving in the opposite lane went by me and hit a huge puddle, splashing water all over my windshield. I lost all visibility for like 3 or 4 seconds. I panicked but knew that as long as I kept my car straight I should be fine. But I hit a puddle and hydroplaned while driving blind. Went into a ditch and rolled a few times. 

I wasn't seriously injured. Just a few scrapes and was sore. But when I lost visibility and hydroplaned, I thought to myself, "This is it. This is where I die."  I seriously thought I was going to die.  




 So where are you the dozens of other times people ask questions that have been asked before? 




 A film that you already own that's a prized possession or crown jewel, or a film you long to have a part of your collection, whether it exist or not.  




 Charlie's Angels would have to be mine. What's yours? 




 So I'm looking for a new show to obsess over, but I'm looking for one that's just half an hour long instead of a full hour. The reason for this is that I have a hard time watching an hour long show because I feel like I'm not getting far into the show.

Like for example, in a 3 hour period I could watch 6-8 episodes of a half hour long show. Whereas with an hour long show I could only watch like 3 or 4. I just don't have a lot of time unfortunately. I totally wish I did cause I would totally watch the heck out of Breaking Bad and House of Cards.

I'm up for any genre. So, what are some really good and entertaining 30 minute shows?
 









 This was very well said and encompasses my exact feelings about Drive.  




 It's a romantic drama about loss, love, and the beauty of life. Cheesy, I know, but that's what it's basically about. 

And thanks for the heads up on where to post this! 




 I think it's just the opposite though. I know John Carter will be about a dude named John Carter. That title tells me *exactly* what it's about. And besides *tons* of movies have titles that tell you nothing about the movie. In fact, some of the most successful movies have titles that don't tell you what the movie is about and they did well. Also, there have been many movies where the title is just the character's name, just like John Carter.

Honestly, the title had very little to do with the movie flopping, and was more the fault of the marketing and advertising team. 




 Yeah I have an email. Message me and I'll give it to you.  




 Romantic drama with an emphasis on drama.  




 Hey sorry we do already have someone doing the score. But if you have any samples is love to hear them. I'll keep you in mind for future projects because it'd be nice to work with someone in the same city as me.  




 Yeah I'd be interested! Message me 




 Haha there is none 




 Nope. I mean it'll make it hard, but I understand. I work a job too. We all have day jobs. We would film when we can.  




 Charles is way too cool to do something like that. 




 We're looking for two actors: a guy and a girl who look like they are in their mid twenties or older. Are any of you guys interested? At all? If you are, then message me. Any questions? you can ask in the comments or message me. 

Don't worry we're legit. I mean we're not big, but we're real. We have a crew, but no actors. We could use some help finding people. We had posted on our facebooks that we're looking from people, but no responses. Just a bunch of likes. So I figured I would turn here for help.



 




 Man, that movie's great! 




 Samsara. Quite possibly *the best* looking blu ray out there. Jaw droppingly gorgeous.

The Tree of Life is another stunning film. The creation of the universe scene *has* to be seen on blu ray.

No Country for Old Men is another great blu ray addition, as well as the 2009 Star Trek.

Only God Forgives was one of the most beautiful movies to come out last year. Absolutely stellar cinematography. The look and music of this film are enough to warrant a blind buy if you've never seen it.

The Matrix is a great one as well. Especially the Ultimate Matrix Collection box set that has 35 hours of bonus features. That alone makes it worth it even if the film itself doesn't look good, which it does in fact look great!

Immortals, while a not great movie, is beautiful. Now is that enough to warrant a buy? That's up for debate, but since you can get it for a cheap price, it's not a bad addition.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great addition! Especially now that it has a Criterion release. This is a very pretty film that looks stunning on blu ray.

Lastly, 300. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography of the last decade. I find it to be a must own blu ray, but that's just me.  




 I like this one because I buy blu-rays based on two things: If I love the movie and if it looks really good. 




 It's very hot and very humid where I live, and I have to wear a suit every week. How much of a fashion faux pas would it be to wear a short sleeve button down with a suit? Are there ways to make it look good? Or is it just a straight up no no?

If so, what are some ways to stay cool in a hot humid environment, while still being business formal?

Guys...it's *really* hot here. 




 My absolute favorite genre of books are crime by far with mystery at a very close second. I love Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, and No Country for Old Men.

I'm a very visual person who really loves movies as you can probably tell by my favorite books, so it has always been hard for me to get into books. But there's just something about a good crime or mystery book that gets me super interested.

It doesn't necessarily have to be about cops either. Also, if it has some good violence, that'd be great! I also am really into crime stories that are dark, tragic and don't usually end happy. 




  'Cloverfield' should have gotten an NC-17 for use of the words shit and fuck over a hundred thousand times.

What? 




 Lex Luther discussion starts at about the 12:15 mark for those interested in only that. It's not much info, but it's Eisenberg's thoughts. 









 I know the bomb didn't malfunction and I shouldn't have said it did, but something still happened to the bomb that made them have to go in and manually detonate it. I mean you're totally right though that it was relevant to the story, but my point still stands that it's cliche. 




 I should preface this by saying that I've never seen a Godzilla film besides Roland Emerich's.

Overall  I thought it was alright, but underwhelming. I'll get to the positives before the negatives because my positives basically echo everyone else.

I thought the movie looked great and was shot really well. I also thought the acting was actually pretty great. Cranston was of course fantastic and I'm glad to see Taylor-Johnson getting more roles. And Watanabe and Olsen, despite how little their characters contributed to the story, were really great as well. Godzilla's design was fantastic as well as the kaiju's designs.

Now the negatives. The human drama might have been too much, or at least pointless. I felt Olsen's character was a little pointless and didn't do anything except give our hero something to lose.

I honestly think the final battle would have been so much better if it happened in daylight instead of night. It was already hard to see things with all the smoke, but then the darkness made it even harder to see things.

This brings me to my next complaint. I don't know, maybe it was just my theater, but did this movie look a little dark to anyone? Again, this was probably just my theater so this might not be a problem with the movie.

I found the sense of scale to be lacking. I could totally *see* the sense of scale, but I couldn't *feel* it, if that makes sense. Like the creatures looked huge but they didn't feel huge. I couldn't feel the weight. Like at the Hawaiian airport when Godzilla stepped right in front of the windows, i feel like there should've been more bass or the glass should've cracked or shattered, but it was just kind of soft for a monster that size. Also, the final battle didn't feel huge. Buildings were crumbling and falling over, but it just sounded too quiet. So I guess that's a problem with the sound design. I also thought his roar was kind of underwhelming.

I honestly think the whole military "blow up the monster/aliens with a big bomb, but the bomb malfunctions so some person/people have to go on a suicide mission to manually detonate the bomb" thing is so over-done and eye-rolling. I think it would have been so much better if the military was all like, "All we can do is just hope that these monsters will kill each other of and pray we'll survive." Like, why couldn't humans just stand aside and follow Watanabe's advice and "Let them fight"? It would've made for a more entertaining movie if it was 30% human drama and 70% monsters fighting. Instead of 80% cliche military stuff and 20% monsters fighting.

The last complaint I have is that it should have been either Godzilla vs the military with no kaiju , or Godzilla vs kaiju with very little military action. I think it was just way too much to have Godzilla vs kaiju vs military. All the military stuff should have taken a back seat, but instead, the military stuff was driving the whole thing and the monster stuff was riding in the trunk.

I know I sound like I hated this movie, but I don't. It's not a bad movie at all, I just personally found it underwhelming.  




 Parties. Seriously. Don't want people waiting in long lines outside 4 bathrooms. 









 D3 The Mighty Ducks 




 The first Saw is actually a really good movie. 




 No. No slipcover. If it did I'd keep the copy of fight club, lol. I live in Memphis.  




 A few months ago my partner and I started work on a romantic drama for our next project. At the time I was excited because the story was great and the concept was great and we were looking forward to doing a different kind of film. 

Fast forward to today and I'm about halfway through writing the film and I've just...lost all interest in it. 

Over the course of the last few months the project has been behind schedule due to life(school and work). So I've gone from being really pumped about the project to being kind of stressed and just uninterested in it. I really want to put my heart and soul into every project I work on but my heart just isn't in this project. 

It's not in my wheelhouse or my interest. I love writing crime stories and mysteries, so going from that to a romance is so...different for me. I'm never sure what to do and I'm worried the end result will be not that good with a shallow story, bad characters and really nothing special. 

I've just lost so much steam. I think that the worst part is that while I'm writing this film, there are a handful of other projects I'd rather be working on. We've had to make creative changes to our romantic drama in order to make it work and a lot of these changes were things I liked so I personally don't feel invested in it at all. 

The only thing keeping me going is that my partner *is* excited about the project. I can't just drop out. Not now. But I feel my lack of interest in the project will end up hurting the final product. 

Any advice? Any way I could regain interest somehow? Should I drop out? I'm really lost here.  




 I recently got a gift from a friend that turned out to be two blu-rays I already have. So I figured, instead of selling them somewhere because I don't know where to sell them, I'd try to trade them to you guys! I don't really know how this goes, so if you are interested in one of them, or both, just let me know!
