 From Steam Stats:

"Steam is down for routine maintenance every Tuesday." 




 I originally categorized it as "Hijacked Account/Stolen" but I resolved my issue and now I just want to purchase games again. What would you have suggested I changed it to? 




 Hmmm.... This might just be crazy enough to work. 




 I'm having the same issue, actually. I'm also using Gmail. 




 Long story short; I thought my account might have been at risk at a point so I decided to lock it (Huge mistake). I've been waiting four or five days now for Steam Support to reply but no answer. I've never had to use Steam Support before so I really didn't know what I was in for. Now the Summer Sale is almost here and my account is forbidden from purchasing games. Just came here to grieve. Perhaps someone could give me some hope with their Steam Support stories? 




 Good old role playing  




 Dammit, we need lamps 




 I thought I was the only one unfortunate enough to have to use this light method. Works like a charm though. 




 I've been smoking for around 7 or 8 years now. As of the past three years, I've been a heavy smoker. I used to be fine. Relaxed, giddy, aware, etc. Now I just get too tired too quickly and paranoid on top of that. Paranoid that people are watching me or judging me or something. It's pretty shitty cause I would always smoke to relax my mind but now it's doing the opposite. Any opinions on this? 









 I don't really see the cause for alarm here. It's a joke curator, he's had a YouTube channel for quite some time too. It's not that serious, guys. Not really doing any harm. 









 Did you miss the romantic relationship between the War Boy and one of the daughters? And I'd definitely call Max's unexplained PTSD sequel baiting. 









 If I had the option, I'd remove the bars on the windows too. I don't think this is a very good comparison. But obviously enough people like multiple monitors enough that they don't mind the bars. I'd hate them, I would rather have a single screen and nothing getting in the way. 




 Shlohmo, so chill 




 I love dark. I love dreary and miserable, I like movies that make me think about dark things or ask me dark questions. So what you're all saying is that this is made for me?
