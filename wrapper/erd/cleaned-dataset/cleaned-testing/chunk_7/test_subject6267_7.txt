 I just got the Heroine Kiss Me Volume and Curl today after waiting 2 weeks and I have to say... I'm really disappointed, especially since this mascara gets so much love from this community.

This mascara makes my lashes so clumpy and they feel *crunchy*- like how your hair feels if you've used too much hairspray.

I literally did the wiggle at the roots and brush up, and waited about 30 secs to let it dry and tried a second coat, which just completely grouped my lashes together.

If I do a gentle rub along my eyelid when my contacts move about, my lashes move together and stick together.

Did I get a complete dud or am I doing this thing wrong- does this mascara need to be dried out a little to work better like the Lanme Hypnse? Was anyone else really disappointed with the results? 




 Oh my goodness! I'd love to have whatever you don't want anymore , I'm still a newb at the AB game. This is so kind of you, thank you. 

I'm in the UK and I'll pay for shipping if you'd like 




 Yeah, they're described as 'neo-liberal' 




 I'm trying out the exact reverse to you with regards to Vit C, I've been using a SAP for three months and find that's there pretty much no difference in PIH or the evening out my skin tone, so now I'm waiting for C20 to arrive to test out.  




 I recently started using it consistently and have noticed its cleaned out the blackheads on either side of my nose but not the ones on my nose, where my blackheads are deeper and pores are larger. 

The best thing for acne I have used is Rx benzoyl peroxide, which I use on my back and occasionally on my forehead. 

If you're looking for something for an occasional pimple then I would highly recommend hydrocolloid bandages, they've totally changed my life, I don't even pick my spots anymore!! 




 Fellow Chinese gal here, I totally got the whole wet hair thing and no cold food before periods thing. I normally like to think of myself as a logical thinker and have always felt that Chinese Medicine lacks scientific theory and proof but man, the cold food thing really seems to pack a punch.

I have experimented several times with eating ice cream, drinking cold water, not wearing socks on cold floors whilst try to keep as many controls as I could and when I did, I got the worst back pain on my periods. When I stopped the cold food and 'han qi' a week before my periods, I would get no back pain at all! Obviously I'm not able to say that it definitely works but it does make me take caution.

I think the cold water thing may also be due to the fact that tap water is basically a no-go in China. I know that in Beijing, its still pretty dirty and so we always drink boiled water thats been allowed to cool a little. It may also be due to the older generations' experience, when water was less processed and even dirtier. 




 Oh I see, well just do what you're comfortable with! Have a fun trip!! 




 Well I have the sleek palette, use a matte cool brown to put under the cheekbones and the highlighter on top of your cheekbones. When I travel I just get some highlighter on my finger and dab or swipe onto my cheekbones or if I'm ging somewhere special- the high points of my face i.e. my cheekbones, bridge of my nose and my cupids bow.

I just turned 18 and honestly, I would advise against wearing much makeup, especially when travelling long journeys or living outdoors. Do you normally wear makeup? 




 Over the last year or so, I have had the worst lips in my life so far. I used to just use vaseline or Carmex on my lips but then they became so dry and flakey and painful.

I then tried Blistex Intensive Mositurising balm and their balm for cold sores, they solved the problem overnight but they did nothing in the long term. I also shelled out for the Nuxe reve de miel balm, but that also failed to sufficiently moisturise my lips.

I have now changed to Hurraw's vegan lip balm and oh my goodness, this stuff is incredible. I apply before bed and wake up with soft lips and just dab on gently about twice a day even though I drink around 2.5 litres of water a day. I have the Lime, Earl grey tea and cherry one (which is tinted red).

I do find the more balmy ones such as the Nuxe reve de miel work better under vaseline, to seal the moisture in. 




 I would suggest forgoing the mascara and just using an eyelash curler, especially if you're using a waterproof mascara cause its such a pain to get off and you won't be able to with just baby wipes. I go camping and road tripping quite often and find mascara is just a bother, I normally just do highlighter and contour using a contour kit, curl my lashes and tinted lip balm with SPF.

Wearing adequate sunscreen is really important too, especially on your body.

BTW baby wipes are also really using in cleaning pots and mess tins if you don't have access to running water! 




 Thank you!! I did try to search YT and pinterest for 'geometric nails' but the exact thing I wanted didn't come up, sorry! I have posted the inspiration picture though, I just freehanded it by copying the forefinger in that picture 




 Thank you! Neither actually, I have a black striping brush that I actually used in my first attempt at nail art but found that the lines looked too thick and so for this one, I used a 0.38 Muji gel pen which looked much better but harder to control for my left hand. 




 Thank you!! I think the hack is not actually using a striping brush- I used a 0.38 mm Muji gel pen for the black lines and although my right hand looks like a hot mess, I imagine it looks way better than it would've done with actual polish! 




 I thought I'd post the inspiration for these nails [here](http://content.asos-media.com/~/media/300414115043en-GB/Images/uk/2014/05/01-thursday/NAILS-WITH-LOUISE/nail-art-intagram-mananails.jpg?mw=398)

I'm not quite able to sit still for a full nail art session with waiting times so I did a lazy-girl-shortcut 




 I'm warming up to it but the original inspo was just a few nails bare and nude on the rest

edit: added the inspiration picture cause my description sucked 




 Oh my goodness the search function... I'm pretty computer savvy and it still took my about 20 mins to figure out how to use that thing.. 




 Thank you!! I'm not too keen on it either but unfortunately I don't have many colours so I could only leave it bare. 

noragrets though because this paint job only took 20 minutes all in all!! 




 I feel like the proces have gone back up, my OST C20 I bought 3 days ago was $10.66 and is now $12....

I just went on the [old.roserosestore.com](old.roserosestore.com) to check on my order status and the C20 was $10.66 too... huh.

Edit: Spelling

 Oh I've heard great things about the Stila one, I'll defo look into it. Thank you! 




 Its best to soak first to open pores and wash your body with soap to remove some oils first.

I normally use hot water (I'd say 39 degrees celcius if we're being specific) to bathe in for about 10-15 mins and let my hair mask soak in, then wash with soap.

The soap is super important, you'll find that the mitt won't just 'slip' all over your body. Then long strokes with pressure (sadistic but you need it) up and down until you turn red and these rice shaped bits of nasties start to form on your skin. 

TADA, you're now raw and in pain but exfoliated!!!
