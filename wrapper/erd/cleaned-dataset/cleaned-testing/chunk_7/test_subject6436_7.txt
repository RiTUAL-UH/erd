 Chairman Pao is an elitists gatekeeper.  Down with censorship. Now if we could only get rid of moderator ProtoDong from r/technology  




 This woman is an elitists gatekeeper. Down with censorship.  




 ProtoDong need to be fired like  chairman Pao 









 I am not a scientist. Would like the scientific community to research my idea and replicate it in lab. I also believe that Joe six pack should have the freedom to try any alternative medicine he wants.  You sound like an gatekeeper. Freedom of speech buddy.  




 Personal attacks is a sign that someone is losing the argument.  




 Yep, it is called freedom.  This is not the USSR. 




 Then show idea too your lab if what you say is true. 




 I want it to spread with or without testing. Then the gatekeepers won't be able to supress technology. Trust me if enough people hear about idea someone will test idea in lab. 




 The Wright brothers or Tesla did not go though "proper channels" when building there ideas. 




 Amen brother.  




 Ditto. 




 Thank you. 




 Good info, buddy. Did you notice that they use blue LEDS not blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulbs. Blue spectrum hydroponic bulbs works much better and faster than blue LEDS. Plus the light is safer. The airforce is also using powerful light to disinfect rooms from MRSA. I will provide a link in a min. 

 




 It is a weed grow bulb buddy. If it caused damage to skin people would be sueing hydroponic grow bulb companies
. People work all day, legally in colorado, under these bulb. Thank you for expression concern just please keep it civil.  




 /u/ProtoDong go away. It is not slander if it is true. 




 You are wrong.  I made a video where I tryed to treat a mrsa infection with benathonium cloride/ epson salt and alternating hot/cold. I did not use the 1000 watt bulb in this video. This treatment was a failure not my combination therapy that includes a hydroponic bulb. Got it buddy.
 




 The problem is how would I infect the mice with mrsa. Not safe except in a lab setting. Also. I am an animal lover,even mice,  so I couldn't do this. Answer  you question buddy. 




 Please keep forum civil. 




 I don't mind that you disagree with me but you language is uncalled for buddy. 




 Yep. Moderator /u/ProtoDong need to go away and stay in /r/technology where he belongs. 




 /u/ProtoDong it wasn't advertising. It is a open source free idea I am giving away. Also you could have contacted me before deleting my post from the first page. Also, your rude language was uncalled for. Please leave me alone. 




 /u/ProtoDong I contacted the moderators from /r/conspiracy about your rude language and trolling behavior. I don't want your posts deleted. I just requested that you and your trolling buddies leave me alone. Go back to /r/technology. This is the conspiracy subreddit. So leave me alone. Ok. Buddy. From proud Veteran. 




 /u/ProtoDong is a /r/technology moderator.  The rule of reddit don't apply to him. I messaged the moderators of /r/conspiracy about his behavior. I don't want his posted deleted I just want him and his trolling buddies to go back to /r/technology and leave me alone. All his rude post's had negative points but overnight most of his post are now positive. 




 This is the moderator from /r/technology who deleted me after getting over 600 upvotes. 




 /u/ProtoDong you are a  moderator. Go back to /r/ technology. Stop trolling or does the rules not apply too you 




 Must obey gatekeeper. 




 Good link. Thank you.  




 If I get blacklisted from this site that is where I may end up.

 I think it's funny. Rise against the machines. 




 Also why is the moderator /u/ProtoDong  and his buddys from r/technology up voting his rude comments. Went to bed at 3am and his comments where all negative and now they are all like magic positive. I thought the moderator's where suppose to be neutral. This post has 92% upvote, so leave us alone. 




 You didn't even watch the entire video. In the video, I stated that I was going to go to the hospital to have my infection cultured. The proof is in a lab result currently in my medicial record.  




 LoL 




 I have an after video on my youtube channel.  




 Goodnight buddy.  




 It is called freedom buddy. Don't pretend you care about what happens to other people. If you were a caring person, you wouldn't use such nasty language.  




 I think you are wrong but even if you are correct. I don't care. It is call empathy. When the law become lawless you must break it. I don't  care about your fear tactics. Go troll some place else. Quit pretending  you care about me. If I go too jail so be it. If you want to have an intelligent coversation of why I am wrong I am all ears. Name calling doesn't prove you know what you are talking about.

  




 Please be honest. I am a big boy.  Can handle it. 




 By heating up and cooling down my arm, this increases blood flow. More white blood cells get to the source of infection. This helps in the healing process. I am too tired to answer the rest of your questions. Message you tomorrow.  




 No it isn't.  It is only a criminal offense if money is exchanged. The government can regulated medicial commerce not  medicial speech.  I have 1st amendment free speech rights. 




 Yea and moderator /u/ProtoDong has too wait until I am at the top of page one before he deletes my post.  




 Thank you.  




 Ok. Sorry tired not thinking completely straight. 




 Also, look at the spectrograph of a blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb.  




 Yep. That is one of the papers. There is many others. Go to blackwell synergy and do a search.  




 Blue spectrum light is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. So moderaters statement is nonsense. Also 400nm blue light acne treatment uses a 12 watts LED bulb. I use a 1000 watt blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb. This extra power increases penetration. 




 Google 400nm mrsa or blue light mrsa. Then get back with me. 




 I have had like 15. Around a dozen treated with antibotics.  Then my last three, treated with my combination therapy.
