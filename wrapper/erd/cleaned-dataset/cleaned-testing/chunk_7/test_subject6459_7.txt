 And all the other points? I would like to know where you got your facts from.  




 What's your source on the north having more slaves? The other guy already spoke about NJ, so what are the other states that didn't give up their slaves? If you say MD or KY, remember that they were already under marshal law. 

we were fighting to keep North troops out of our homes because they were actively making grabs for our land.

What land were northern troops grabbing before secession?

There was also the issues of state rights

What about State's rights? 

massive taxes that were slowly driving us into crippling poverty

What taxes are these? Are you referring to the shipping tariffs? 

Yes,  Sherman's March was devastating. But do you have a source for the rapes, murders, and burning people alive? 

There were no saints on either side, but that doesn't mean the south was fighting for the right thing?  









 Well, it is if you're talking about The Stormlight Archive. In the real world though... 




 No silly that's the other guy. 




 I am a stick! 




 Can you translate the first sentence of Genesis for me? 




 5'9. My dad is 6', and my mom is 5'. I guess I'm lucky I'm not shorter. 




 Nope, gap year before college. 18-19. 




 Not eligible because I was on a gap year trip. Change it to let me in and I would sign right up! 




 If that was the primary grievance, why did the disengagement from Gaza lead to more conflict? 




 How about Jews have the right of return to Israel, and Palestinians have the right of return to Palestine? Is that such a difficult concept?
 




 It comes from a coding behavior, where the asterisk can stand for anything. For example, searching "re\*" will give you any word that begins with "re", like red, read, reddit, or redemption. So searching "trans\*" gives you trans, transperson, transman, transwoman, etc. It has evolved to mean any permutation of the word trans so they don't all have to be mentioned. 




  And strange considering a nation which did not allow its people to freely leave the nation allowed Jews to leave by the hundreds of thousands from 1948-1980s.

OMG, do you actually believe this? Rofl. There was a massive Jewish migration to Israel after the collapse of the soviet union even though they are allowed to leave the whole time? You might type well, but you're still crazy. 




 You misunderstood what I was saying.

I don't think I did, considering your next sentences. 

The Messiah is (sic) perfect

No, he will not be.

Humans are not perfect. 

Very true. And the Messiah will be human.

 The Messiah would have been able to follow the OT laws perfectly.

Nope, as I said, the Messiah will be human, no need to be perfect. 

Of course Jews still follow those laws, but the entire point of the OT was what?

To teach us, of course. After all it is called the Teaching.

They also don't believe in Jesus. That is a concept which is part of the entire point of Christianity.

No, Judaism, is not Christianity - Jesus. The theology, even just about the Messiah, is very, very different.


 




 The laws of the OT were so impossible for human beings to follow, they were meant for a perfect being; The Messiah (as Christians and Jews see it)

No, Jews do not believe this. The laws are for all Jews. 




 The first fruits 




 No, read the text carefully. Able gave up the *first* of his flock, while Cain gave of the fruits of the ground. There is a specific herbrew word for first fruits, bikurim, that is not used. Sacrifices are supposed to be from what you can produce, but what does it say about a gift when you don't give it from your best? 




 Because this wasn't about meat vs. veggies, it is about the best vs. the mediocre. Able gave his best, Cain gave his regular stuff. Which would you regard as a better gift?
 




 This is because Judaism/Jews predate the modern separation between religion and ethnicity. The best way to think about Judaism is that it is a set of laws for a tribe, the Jewish people. The tribe got dispersed and carried their rules with them. You are part of the tribe if you were born into it by its rules, or you gain nationality by becoming a citizen - in modern times, convert.  Does that make sense? 

Now for your other points:    

They still are Jewish. Someone can be Jewish, no practicing, or even having rejected the religion and their family lineage is not traced back to eastern Europe, or it's a weak connection which normally wouldn't be used to identify race. It doesn't make sense. 

First, Jews trace lineage back to the expulsion from Israel, not to eastern Europe. Only a subset of Jews, Ashkenazim, are from Eastern Europe.

Second, the connection isn't so much used to identify race as your national/tribal affiliation. Think of it like this: Once you gain American citizenship, all your children are American citizens no matter where they are born. All their children, your grandchildren, are American even if they never enter America. Now just have the extra step that it must be your mother, not any American, and you've got a rough equivalency.

I just don't get how if I marry a jewish girl who's father is a north African Jew, mother is christian Caucasian. We get married and ignore all religion. Our kids would be Jewish?

See the nationality explanation above. The only difference is that for your kids to be American you have to register their birth an the embassy, but for Judaism is automatic. (Minor point: She would not be Jewish by traditional Jewish laws, so many Jews would not think she was Jewish and therefore her children would not be either.)

What is your thoughts on people saying something negative towards Israel as, 'Those Israeli...?'

It's as good (bad) as any other prejudice is. The problem is that many people say this to cover up anti-Semitism, and you only have to prod an inch for it to come out. It makes Jews assume that its not said with good intentions. 




 Exactly the title. I followed the guide for step: extended, and tried to do everything exactly as they said. But whenever I boot up skyrim try to load and old save or start a new game, I immediately get a CTD. Any ideas?

Edit: [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LspA1T2d8ZYBY7LIcJA5VGPjrpk9bRx8aQZsFFhBtEg/edit?usp=sharing) is the Papyrus log. I'm sure something went wrong, I just don't know what.  




 Honestly, she sounds contrite and probably means well, but she doesn't deserve you. She doing this just to relieve her own guilt, not for you at all. Never talk to her again.

On the other hand, do remember that you weren't exactly being played, and that the person you were talking to was probably real, even though the pictures of her were not.  Take the lessons you learned over the years and apply them to the other things in your life. Good luck! 




 No, it would not at all, as evidenced by Deutoronomy 18. 




 while putting zero effort in understanding the fact that blood sacrifice is a huge part of the atonement of sin for the Jews

Because it is not true. 




 In Judaism, if their prophecy doesn't come to pass.

If their *positive* prophecy didn't come to pass. A negative prophecy can be averted by repentance, which is why all those you mentioned are still considered prophets. 




 1. Wikipedia: People accuse Israel of the motive, but no evidence.
2. RT: 3 buildings were destroyed for a reason unspecified. No buildings have been built there before or since. Includes a blatant lie: "All previous destruction of Palestinian homes in the E1 zone has resulted in Israeli settlement construction." There is no Israeli settlement construction in E1.
3. A bunch of links; only one mentions this topic. It is an Haaretz editorial, which only says this behavior is "historic." Again no examples.
4. A video containing a 30 second clip stating that farms are being "bulldozed by settlers to build illegal settlements," No sources, no details, wrong information. (Settlers don't have bulldozers, the army does.) And Press.Tv is not a trustworthy source, IMO. 
5. Israel bulldozing illegal West Bank settlements

Look, I think the current settlement policy is a horrible idea and wish there was a change of leadership in the Israeli government. But opposition should be based on truth, not lies. 




 Of course. As I said, Rashi is not commenting on the preposition, but the mention of first of the flock, but not first of the fruit. 




 Not me, but he emphasized it to show that is says "of" not "first of." That is the distinction. 




 Because giving a gift that is not your best shows that you don't value the person you're giving to. The same principle applies to sacrifices to God. 




 What? One says first and one does not, it has nothing to do with the preposition. That is what Rashi comments on. 




 Name one time a Palestinian house was bulldozed so that a settler can build on it. 




 Because ISIS is nowhere near the border with syria. 




 It is downloadable only, there is no way to transfer it. 




 Pre-zoloft: Yes

Post-zoloft: No. Unless I haven't done so for a week or more.  




 Yes, they should. But in the views of some, France does not.  




 Wouldnt be so bad if the settlements were on empty land.

They are.  




 False. It was better than Christian Europe, sure, but nothing like without persecution. 




 Over 150,000 Palestinians have been forced out of Area C over the years

Source?  




 Certainly it has significance. The polytheist/Atheist would make a similar cry against claims of monotheism as a way to box you in from using your own text and history to explain/define what you beleive about God. 

What?

No. You don't have to accept what is written with respect to Christianity as true but to reject it out of hand as part of the argument itself is disingenuous. Like the Moslem, you a Jew can claim it has been corrupted or misinterpreted/manipulated. 

I am not claiming this. You are claiming as proof that Jesus forgiving sins means he is God. I am saying that the only thing we know is that Jesus **says** he forgive sins. Unlike everything else in the NT, this is something he said, not something he did. Therefore, this is not a proof.

Because the Op self identifies as a Moslem and that was how my response begin. Jews clearly make different arguments. 

Looks like we pretty much make the same argument here...
 




 It has no significance because it is the central claim that is being disputed. 

Others : Jesus is not God!

You: But what about healing others, mastering nature, forgiving sins and raising from the dead? [This shows he is God!]

Others: Many other prophets healed others, mastered nature, said God forgave sins and raised from the dead. These do not make Jesus unique. 

You: But Jesus forgave sins of people directly, showing he is God!

Others: That is the claim that the NT is making, and is tautological. For Jesus to forgive sins, he must be God. The only proof we have of this, even through the NT itself, is Jesus saying so. Claiming to forgive sins does not make Jesus unique.

Make sense?

He also is reported to have said others after will do these and much greater things (JN 14:12) so not being unique isn't the significant qualifier.

Ok, then why did you say that these acts are ignored? And even so, we're talking about people **before,** not after.
 




 The only two ways we'll ever get it is if God reveals it directly or we build a time machine. Neither seem likely anytime soon, but we can hope! 




 Huh? He's not trying to prove that this happened, just that it is not shifting the goalposts like you claimed. 




 You're just going back to Jesus is God again. The things the NT claimed he did were done by all the other prophets and did not make him unique, aside from him saying that he is God.  




 Elijah and Elisha. Go through their stories, they are pretty interesting. Note that they did not "claim to forgive sin," but claimed that "one's sins were forgiven by God." Subtle difference. 




 It doesn't. It is an argument against your disproof.  




 Yeah, fan-fiction is usually substandard and bastardizes the original material. Shouldn't be surprising. 




 C.E. and B.C.E. were first used extensively by Jews in order to reference the Gregorian calendar without having to reference Jesus. The argument over whether it is "our lord" or "the lord" is ultimately irrelevant, since both are a direct contradiction of Judaism. Taking your title literally, do you believe Jews should not use C.E. and B.C.E in their own writings and lessons? 




 You could not say the same about God, because God by definition has always existed (YHVH probably means something like The Eternal) and exists outside of what He created (see the Kabbalistic take on the creation story). Therefore, God can be excluded as per-existent, and the waters cannot  




 Rashi is saying that if you're taking it literally, you must think that the first sentence reads "In the beginning of [all]" with the all omitted. But if it was the beginning of everything, there could not have already been water! Therefore, the sentence does not have an all and indicates that the story is not literal. 




 Which ones? 




 Then why didn't they make peace before there were any settlements? 




 So as long as the soldiers don't bear your insignia, then you're not attacking anyone? I bet you think that Russia wasn't "engaging in war" in eastern Ukrain either. 




 They are quite open to inspection

Hahahahaha 




 The Palestinians, whose only real crime is to live in the occupied territories and got caught in the middle of it all, bear little responsibility for those wars,

Look up [Haj Amin Al-Husseini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini) and then say that again with a straight face. 




 Arming Hezbollah and Hamas and encouraging them to use those weapons are not "causing a war"?

 




 I can't decide whether you're serious, in which case you know so little you shouldn't be commenting on this, or not, in which case I have no idea what you're trying to say.

If it's the former: The tunnels made are built by Hamas dozens of feet underground, lined by cement to hold them up, and take months to dig. The exits are only dug just as fighters are exiting to make sure that it is not found. And you think these are tunnels for the poor workers who want to work in Israel? Just FYI 




 What exactly do you think tunnels into Israel are for? There are no checkpoints on that border, but border crossings, like for two separate countries.  




 You must have a really bad spanish teacher, the o and a mean male and female should be one of the first things you learn. 




 No reason as to why... I'll message the mods. anyway, here was the full post: 

Edit: It's been approved, yay!


 




 Again, this is especially not helpful for the bar/club question.

I think this thread was deleted, because it is not showing up on new...oh well. 




 Of course there isn't one magical way, but we don't want to come across too strongly or be an asshole, so "just take a risk" or "put yourself out there" isn't helpful. This advice is how we get in the "friendzone" or going home without a date in the first place. How do you do it?  




 There have been a couple of threads up on how we do act. We all know that neither the RedPill approach or the Nice Guy approach is the right one, but we don't know *how* to show interest without being seen as creepy or aggressive. So here's the thread where you give us all advice! What is the difference between aggressive and confident? How do you hit on people without being a PUA? What are the signals that tell you that the girl wants you to go further or to stop?

We know a lot about what not to do, but what **can** we do?

Here are some specific questions, and I'm sure that some other shy guys have more!

Situation: Bar or club

1. I see someone attractive that I want to hit on. What are ways to show interest? What is a good way to start a conversation? I've seen ways that seem rude (getting in their body space, bumping into them on purpose and then introducing yourself, etc.), but is there a positive way of getting and maintaining attention?
  
2. While dancing, how to start dancing with someone without breaking boundaries they might have? I have heard girls complain more than once about guys getting to touchy, and I've seen girls willingly start to grind immediately. How to tell the difference?

Situation: A friend 

1. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in. I have no idea whether they like me back. How do I convey this without being too creepy or violating boundaries? What level of touching is ok before having an explicit conversation? 

2. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in, and I think they are returning my feelings. What are the appropriate steps to take? What is a good way to bring it up, and what is a good way to back out if I'm wrong?

Situation: An acquaintance or passerby

1. I see someone on public transport, on the street, a diner, etc. Is there any way to approach without being a creep? There's more than one article or thread we've read that women don't like being seen as sex objects everywhere they go, so this is a fine line to walk.

2. I have a distant crush on someone I see fairly regularly, like class or work. We might say hi once in a while. What is a good way to approach for the first time? Is it better to try being a friends first, or to ask immediately for a date? 

I'll add anymore if people give me some!

One last thing: We don't want to be Nice Guys, but we're shy because we don't want to be like the assholes we see and that our female friends complain about. We are invested in our identity of being the nice, responsible person, and we don't necessarily want to change that outside of being less shy. As the threads on /r/AskMen have shown, the messages being sent by both society and people around us are confusing, to say the least. We want to be a nice person as well as get hookups/dates/relationships, depending on the individual, but not be creeps. 

Please share your general advice as well as for the situations I described above!
 




 Funny thing, it actually is a Jewish fast day today. It is one of six on the Jewish calendar, including yom Kippur.
You clicked on a shitpost and learned something new today! Comment if you want to know more. :)

 Because this puts the final nail in the coffin of a negotiated solution while Abbas is head of the PA, and also probably drives the Israeli electorate to the right for the upcoming elections. 




 The the ~~Joooooos~~I mean the Israelis! 




 So Jews had the right, in 1948, to make a country wherever they wanted? Good to know! 




 Please stop having so much money 




 The actual story is probably that Jesus was a normal baby, and the virgin part was made up so it would appeal to the people of pagan religions when Christianity began to spread. 




 I'll add this to my list of bad Christian prophecies. I already have two and nobody ever takes me up on them to argue. :( 




 Google is this decade's Bell-At T. It just sells off all your info instead of price gouging you! 




 Oh lordy, here we go again.

The prophecies:

Correct: 3 (but see disputations about genealogy) 

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 4

Not a prophecy: 5

Not about the Messiah: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29

Psalms: 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 

Psalms is not prophetic, it is very nice poetry. You can try and prove otherwise, if you want to try...

Malachi 3:1 - Probably not about the Messiah, and even if it is, their interpretation is nonsensical.

Daniel 9 - This is not about the Messiah. [See here.](http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/counter-missionary-2/texts/daniel-9-a-true-biblical-interpretation/)

10 points - These are all pretty stupid post hoc connections. They are not "foreshadowing" of any kind.

Please, even for Christians there are better arguments than these... 




 The problem is that standardized testing has been shown to favor the rich. 




 Pray tell, what exactly did that piece of information show you?  




 Christianity is not the same as all theism. Yes, it has a lot of contradictions, but why don't you look at the other options instead of throwing everything out?

Do you really not know why having higher average temperatures will be harmful? 




 It's because you're not reading the 800 year old text correctly or in context.

 Mmmmm. does that fedora fit snugly on your head?  




 Through much of 2008, Israeli and Syrian diplomats discussedwith the assistance of Turkeyterms for ending the state of war that has existed between them since 1948. 

In the [first source](http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/mappingpeace.pdf) quoted in wikipedia. Your move. 




 Before I even get to your argument, what does anything have to do with Syria? 




 In historical terms, Israel and Syria have been in a state of war since 1948

[Source](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_syria_the_view_from_israel141). I just picked one off Google, there are a lot more. **You are wrong.** 




 I can concede this logic is sound, but I don't think that this would be done unless another goal was achieved as well. Otherwise it is politically too risky. 




 why does Israel has the right to break the air space of another country, to draw bombs on it infrastructures and move out

**Because they are at war, and the IDF is attacking military targets.** How long will it take to get this through your head? This is what happens in war. If they don't want this to happen, they should finally make peace.

When Hamas send it rockets from Gaza with almost zero casualties, Israel destroyed whole gaza and killed thousands, Oh yeah I forgot that was totaly self defense....

Because civilians were under attack, and one of the primary purpose of a state is to defend it's residents. Again Syria is totally allowed to attack Israel military bases (not civilians like they did in previous wars), but they know they will be utterly crushed. 




  Israel is not at war with Syria the last time I checked. 

You are wrong. 




 Since the 70's? Since Israel was founded. 




 Since when is attacking a military target of a country you're at war with illegal?

Of course there would be a reaction! Syria can react however they want, but they know any further provocations would result in a crushing defeat. 




 Because every other country would hit civilian areas and kill people. No casualties have been reported. 




 He might be an asshole, but he is also correct. 




 But it doesn't make sense to destroy air defense in a targeted airstrike, because Israel gets around the anti-air batteries in different ways. Assad will just replace the S-300s. 




 Israel and Syria have been at war for *over 60 years.* Why the fuck do you think that this has anything to do with ISIS? 




 And what evidence do you have for that? 




 Of course not. There are two targeted strikes, probably aimed at weapons for Hezbollah, and that's it. 




 Did the person you applied to say anything about right or wrong? I think you have preconceived opinions that you're pushing on others. 




 Knowing the IAF, it probably didn't happen. If it did the IDF will tell the Israeli public sometime today. 




 Because anti-Assad = pro-Isis! I forgot that the world was black and white, thanks for reminding me. 




 Two boxes and two people. So much cooperation.

Why is this news again? 




 PC and Wii U all the way 




 It's about Jerusalem being restored. I don't see what is so complicated here... 




 No, but I would like to :P 




 Thanks! do you have a link to that? 




 Oh well, thanks anyway. 




 Damn,  I didn't think of that.  Do you know of any good cheaper ones?  




 I have the s340. Is there any way to install an optical drive?

Now I'm nervous, and I can't find anything on google. You're probably making a joke...at least I hope so!
