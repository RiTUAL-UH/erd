  You can't get a refund just because you didn't like it

I disagree here. I buy a kindle book, I can return it. I buy digital album from Amazon, I can return it. Amazon doesn't ask me why and how far I got into the book (they ask, but for survey purposes). You buy a book from B N, you can return it back, even if you read it.

Some people always going to abuse the system, that's part of doing business. some people are taking third refill and throw the full cup to the trash. 

 You are paying for an experience

I'm not paying to watch a movie, I'm paying for having a good time. I'm not paying for words on paper, I'm paying to enjoy reading a book. If I didn't have a good time, I didn't get my money worth. Sure, it's partly my problem, but it's also partly the seller problem. 

Guess what. Make good music, make good movies and good games, perform good shows and 99% of the people won't ask for refund. In fact, your business will double because people won't be afraid to take a chance and try your experience. 

**Most people aren't trying to game the system**.

 that is really a luxury, not a right

Of course. I never talked about some basic human right or whatever. Just something that I expect from businesses I work with.

 Yeah, I don't understand the other responses in this thread. You buy a product, any product, you are not happy with it, whatever the reason might be, you should be able to return it and get a refund.  









 I don't think it's a fair comparison. Hannibal, the films, had only two legit movies: the Silence of the Lambs and Reg Dragon (the other films were written just to cash in on tSotL success). In both of them, Hannibal isn't the main character. 

In fact, Anthony Hopkins Oscar winning performance in tSotL was limited to 15 minutes only (second shortest performance to win an Oscar). So the fact that he made a legendary villain in such a short screen time, spending most of it behind bars, says a lot about the actor and the writing/directing.

TV Hannibal gives lots of time to explore the character and his motivation. 2 seasons in, where the second half of each season is devoted to Will/Hannibal conflict, gives a lot to work with.

TV Hannibal also had enough time to introduce another character: Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier (Hannibal's psychiatrist) which is a whole new avenue of character exploration. And on that note, I also like to add that TV Hannibal can allow itself to be very slow with lots and lots of one-on-one talks. 

With 2 psychiatrists (Hannibal, Du Maurier), 1 psychology professor (Bloom) and 1 criminal profiler (Graham) (edit: I'm adding +1 psychiatrist as Chilton) - almost every conversation feels like a therapy session. So no wonder we understand the characters better.

The TV show main challenge is exactly the opposite: keeping some mystery to the character (which I think they are doing a great job at).

 Transsexual don't identify with a their born sex. They work to change their gender, usually through medical intervention. It's a medical condition (GID). 

Transgenders usually just switch and play with their gender. Move back and forth. It's more of a social identity/challenge and less physical/medical issue. 

Transsexuals know their true (mental) gender, it's not what they were born with, and they are working to achieve it. Transgenders, however, don't commit to their true gender, and they feel comfortable in both genders (or don't feel comfortable in any of them).

 Yeah, I was annoyed also. I mean, you got fucking Snowden for an interview, why waste time making stupid jokes? but I think the interview advanced well. He's a comedian, so I guess humor is his comfort zone, which is understandable and it's not like I know any better about these sorts of stuff. 

Overall, he got the message a cross and wasn't afraid to criticize Snowden/NYT. I also liked that Snowden didn't try to sugarcoat what they called "the fuck-up". He simply said mistakes happen, and being free also means dealing responsibly and accepting those mistakes, instead of silencing everyone.

 It's like saying that you are inspired by athletes' quotes only if they won the first place in every event they ever participate. 

People may struggle with depression every single day in their life. They fight the urge to end it all more often than not. The fact that they lost just one time, doesn't write off all their struggle and erase all their wisdom to that point.

Successful people with depression is, all by itself, very inspirational. A successful career is hard work day in day out. Regardless on how it's ended.

Anyway, all that besides the point because as other have mentioned, it's not his quote and he was a terminal patient who decided to euthanize himself. 




 The right way of quoting that is either putting the character's name (Sean Maguire) or the writer's name (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck). If there's a picture of Robin Williams, then it should be RW in character. 

In movies it's more common to use the character's name because there are sometimes multiple writers and they aren't always that known. Where in books it's a mix between the character and the author.

 Or... you used to believe a lot more pranks back then.  




  it takes practice which he doesn't seem to put in from the free throw line and never has

Maybe. I don't know his routine and I can't/won't defend him. So not putting any effort might be the case. Maybe he doesn't give a fuck, plain and simple. What I'm saying is that it's not likely. I also say, that as a general phenomena, we don't see correlation between improving shooting percentage and practice (at this level, I'm not talking about amateur players). 




 Well, I can't tell specifically about Rondo. I mean, the guy is a pro player, he has any motivation in the world to be successful at his profession. And if it's something as easy as practicing more, he's probably doing that already.

He used to hit 60% at the start of his career and fell to 30% this season. This is either an abnormal reading (same as LeBron getting 4 points in the finals, or Kobe getting 80 points, but on a larger scale), a new trend, or he might hit a mental wall in his performance. 

Either way, I can't believe that simply training more or shooting extra 100 shots after a game (which he probably does) is what's gonna make a difference here. It might build confidence which is good, maybe take some pressure off, but it's not like this will improve his eye/hand coordination by 100%. 




 TV show subs are best left unsubscribed during the season and visited on demand.  




 The best one is when he talks to (and shoots) the fake cop in Outlaw.

 Maybe Im crazy, or Im just having a hell of a day but did you just give me an order? 




 Yeah, you are right of course about the LoLN. I should have added that it's given as a way to explain my point, but not as something that mathematically describes the game.

Anyway, my point is that player's stats are pretty much locked in a tight range, and it takes practice to keep it that way. Saying that players with low % should just practice more, is being a little unfair to them. Most of the players in the league train close to what humanly possible with guidance from the best trainers in the world. 




  Put the shots in and get better at a skill that is required for your fucking job

It's really not that simple. If you (or any other human being) start playing basketball regularly, you'll reach your average numbers pretty quickly ([Law of large numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)). After that, it'll be very hard to change those averages. Doesn't matter if you'll get $1m a month, if you shoot x%, you'll shoot x%. Sure some players see different stats over the years, but they are few and the change isn't very significant (1SD plus/minus). This change isn't often contributed to practice but to other factors like health, fatigue or just abnormal readings.

And some anecdote: Kobe Bryant is probably [the hardest working player in the past 2 decades](http://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-work-ethic-2013-2?op=1). His [FT% ranges](http://i.imgur.com/XBJcKOS.png) from 82% to 85% without any trend. His FG% ranges between 42% to 46%. That's extremely narrow range for 20 years pro career. It's like none of this practice really mattered.

So the fact is that practice around the clock is needed just to keep you on your averages.  




 Yeah, but I don't put automatic trailing command. I adjust it manually. For example, I can put the stop below the swing low. If the position still alive after few days, I might place the stop based on weekly chart. If the position moves up (or down if it's short) I might use ATR. If the stock had a trend that never violated X days moving average, I might use that line as a moving stop.

I must say that in my experience this is **a low probability** setup. Meaning, 8-9 times out of 10 I stopped out at a worse price than if I had just liquidized at target. However, the 1-2 exceptions usually make up for it. The hard part is keep doing that until it pays off. 




 Plot twist: the CEO of HRC is named Tammy. 




 One cannot. You gotta trust the source. Most hacks that replace libraries and executables (i.e. dll, exe files) do some kind of memory scan/write. Those commands are identified by virus scanner as malware. Most key-gens will be picked up also.

Virus scans are good for legitimate files that you aren't sure about the source. For example, when you download Windows installation (without the loader). Or when someone in some forum uploads a file that you aren't sure about. 




 Good for him. Any comedian that's worth something gotta upset somebody. He's lucky the bar for upsetting (or should I say triggering) isn't very high today.

 They're good, but you'll get positive results for some legit hacks. 




 For me it depends on different factors. First, some of my systems are pure quant, so I always take 100% at target. Second, with some of the manual picks, I tend to place a stop near the target and let it run. The longer the position survive the more comfortable I am with wider stops (my trend is validated). Third, if the position is too big, which usually means that I miscalculated the volatility/risk, I'll trim large part of it at target (getting the risk wrong typically means I got other things wrong). And last, if it's the end of a quarter (like today) I tend to be more conservative and book profits early.

  I live outside the US, so the default maps aren't good for me. I read that you can use open-maps?

That depends on where you live. [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) is created by the community, so street names/locations/tracks/trails will be as updated as users updating it. 

Check the website and see if it's good enough for you (probably is). If not, you can either buy Garmin maps or try other methods to obtain those maps.

Just a quick addition: you can download OSM to Garming from [here](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/). 




 Okay, i'll be a minority here: I always listen to music. Doesn't matter if I ride on my road bikes or mtb (or hiking or running or basically any other activity but swimming) I'm always with music. I simply can't imagine myself doing something without a soundtrack, that's a big part of my experience. 

People say it's dangerous and you should listen to your bikes and the traffic. I'm not arguing with that, I guess there's a point here. 




 Gap: stocks that open considerably above or below yesterday's close. It's wrong to give a hard number here, but basically you want to start with stocks that opens with 5% gap or more. For volatile stocks you want a number higher than that.

Volume: you want here also a considerably high volume. Lots of money changing hands mean the stock has a potential to move a lot during the day.

A good time and place to start is earning season, and look at companies that report [before the open](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111 f=earningsdate_todaybefore) or [after yesterday's close](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111 f=earningsdate_yesterdayafter).

 Rachel also says "justified" to Drew Thompson while Raylan is there, in probably one of the best episodes of the show: Decoy.

 That how you Justified it? 




 Well, I look at it differently. I don't think it's a matter of friendship or respect. I think they have a strong bond. They feel connected. Same age, same childhood, similar hard families, weakness to the same woman... and almost similar fate (Raylan can easily image himself in Boyd's shoes and vice versa). They were also exposed to each other (Raylan letting Boyd leave after his father died, Boyd taking him to Nick Augustine). So I would say it's closest thing they have to a family.

 The movie is an almost 20 years old sci-fi and still holds well today. On top of comedy, action and drama blend there's also great timing and a very nice soundtrack. Not a single dead minute in that movie.

  You need to be a goddamn murder wizard to pull it off. 

Yeah, like Hannibal. Think of him as a super villain and it all makes sense.   














 I don't think the "no experience" is related to his physical and weaponry ability. You can be a super soldier, black op, spy and half alien. But if you never worked at a county police, never filled forms, never talked on the radio the way police officers do, never picked up the language, you'll be spotted immediately. So unless they cover that particular point, it's obviously unrealistic. 

I personally don't mind, because that's the premise of the show, that's the foundation. So by the end of the first episode, you either except it or you won't enjoy the story. 
 




 Yeah, there's some weird vibe to it that I can't put my finger on. Anyway, it also gets better through the seasons, which is good. I didn't like the first season that much, but the writing and action got better and better.

 You summed it up well. I enjoyed the first season, but I can't say I'm looking forward to the second season for those exact reasons. Another show that fall down this hole is The Affair.  




 I think it's much more complicated than that. [](#s "He's being an asshole, right. But he's also a scapegoat, a victim, an outcast and totally depended on their good will. He built trust, and he was able to being an asshole in a personal way.") I think it was written nicely.

 I bought used bikes last month. The first thing I asked after the size was: 'I hope it doesn't come out weird, but did you, by any chance, molested a child or participated in child molestation or the general elections?' 




 2 party system magnifies the problem. And I didn't say I want to "get rid of money and politics", I was pointing out that unlimited money fueled elections skews the familiarities of candidates. 

Let me ask you this, do you think there's a significant downside to cap each candidate spending, let's say $200M, and also cap the ad time? 

This works well in many democracies and I don't think people in those countries see it as limiting.   




 Also because politicians who won't support the rich guys have very little chance of even becoming known. Especially in a 2 party system, in which the party as a whole has a strong interest to promote the people who can bring the most money in.

  property is used to exploit others while possession is not

If I'm not mistaken, property creates value beyond personal need, i.e. any means of productions. So any land/factory/machinery/computers that are used to create stuff to be sold to other people are considered properties, and therefore, according to anarchists/communists cannot be privately held but belong to the common.  

Just a quick edit: maybe not belong to the common, but to all the workers who are working on that property.  









 Exactly.  




 That's very nice, gz. How many breaks did you take? I'm always conflicted on how to time mine. 









  I have a ton of miles on my back. Three buldging disks (a tear in one), stenosis of the nerve route and spondylolisthesis. I suffer from sciatica and after games I often cant sit in the car on the drive home, which has made for some interesting rides. Most nights Im bothered by severe cramping in both calves while I sleep, a result of the same damn nerve routes, and the list goes on somewhat comically. Thats what you deserve for playing over 1,300 NBA games. By no means do I tell you this for sympathy  especially since I see these ailments as badges of honor  but maybe I can bring some clarity. 









 Cool, thanks.  




 Frittata is easy and works well with many veggies.

Pasta in one pot is also good for veggies.

If you want just veggies and you think they are about to go bad, simply roast them in the oven or fry them. They can be freezed easily after that or serve as a side dish for almost any main course. 




 From what he said last year, the injuries aren't bad, he doesn't suffer pain, and he can do physical activities. It's just playing NBA is, obviously, too much to handle and probably too risky.

I'm glad he stopped playing while he's still healthy and young (relative to normal people) and I hope he'll live long and happy.

 Best line: their stuff is shit, but your shit is stuff.  




  a show that always showed things exactly as they happened

Exactly. And this scene was showed through Tony's eyes. Hence, the blackness. If you watch this scene, you'll see his POV is established few times before the ending. There are also some foreshadowing done throughout the season ("you never see it coming", "all turn black", "you don't hear the gun", etc.). 




 The best thing about this line is Rylan preaching to another guy, while he himself being the number one asshole in Harlen.  




 It's less a matter of the show being funny or not, but more a matter of structure. 

**Drama** is about conflict and resolution through action or personal change that often comes through a personal discovery process and sometimes life changing choices. **Comedy** is structured to serve the "joke" (or the absurd). Comedy conflicts are often based on misunderstandings or miscommunication for a reason: they don't require tough choices and personal change to be resolved. At the end of the comedy, the characters are usually on the same place as they started. 

Now, obviously this is a broad generalization, and we are lucky to have shows that are good in mixing and bending those structures.

However, in most shows is easy to tell where they lean or where they spend the most time. OitNB is drama (that is often funny). As an opposite example, Louis is a comedy (with some strong drama elements). 

 




 Link to the article in discussion: [The Irrationality of Alcoholics Anonymous - The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/).

It's an interesting topic. But like both women say, there is mostly anecdotal stories (which they both use). The studies do support the social interaction that comes with AA meetings (and obviously can be arranged by other programs). The "12 steps" is however questionable. Yet it can be looked as a framework. For example, let's say I have a training program that allow people to get into shape and lose weight (that's equivalent to the social part of AA, meaning, that part that works). I also build my program around 12 steps in which I encourage the participants to reflect on the lives and what not. That might not be very helpful, but it gives some kind of framework and leveling experience.

 I remember when I was few years old, thinking to myself, while my mom was breast feeding me: "damn, tits are nice, I should play with those when I get older, but not with my mom's cause that's creepy and unorthodox, unless you are part of a culture where it's expected or maybe in a parallel universe."

I didn't know how to express those thoughts until I got to age 2.  




 But this exact post disproves your claim. Case in point, people not complaining about Asians making more money. 

Anyway, you use an unrealistic claim ('let's say we had a perfect society') to avoid dealing with realistic issues ('we are not even close to this'). I think there's fallacy hidden here.  









 Hard the generalize because of different road conditions, but I would say a flat every 1000-2000 km is very reasonable and on the low side. So for you, a flat every 2-3 months is expected. If you have good tires and high pressure the only thing left really is to watch the road and hope for the best. 




 I didn't want to post a list to avoid giving wrong sense of confidence. A bike mechanic will be able to do the job 100% better than you and me. Since you ask, here's a very short list:

* **Wheels**: if you can you wobble it from side to side, it probably has some damage. Does it clear both sides and rotate straight? broken spokes? 

* **Brakes**: worn pads. Touch the wheel or the tyre. (brakes on general are hard to test, because the cables are hidden)

* **Chain**: Rust. Can you pull it easily out of the teeth? that's usually a sign for a worn chain.

* **Pedals**: Smooth spin, rattle free.

* **Frame**: look for dents, especially at the ends of each tube. If the fork looks bent or asymmetrical, it's a big red flag.

 




 Every few months, on 500km per month, isn't that bad.  




 This week I bought used bikes. The process was simple: 1. Meet with the seller, see if you spot anything wrong with the bike 2. Take it for a ride, the longer the better, so bring proper clothes, shoes and something to leave as a collateral (I left driving license) 3. If all good and the bike fits you well, arrange a second meet at local bike mechanic that will examine the bike (suggest the seller to split the bill). If the mechanic gives thumb up, complete the transaction.  




 For those wondering about the other 8, I was able to verify just 7:

* 2Pac  Greatest Hits (death Row, 1998) 
* 2Pac  All Eyez On Me (death Row, 1996) 
* Eminem  The Eminem Show (Aftermath, 2002)
* Eminem  The Marshall Mathers LP (Aftermath\Interscope 2000)
* The Notorious B.I.G.  Life After death  (Bad Boy, 1997)
* MC Hammer  Please Hammer Dont Hurt Em (Capitol, 1990)
* OutKast  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (LaFace, 2003)
 




 how about converting to minutes? i.e. ((12\*60+15)-(11\*60+30))/60? 









 I totally understand him. I mean, here's a man who can raise more money for charity than all other cyclists combined, and here's another man with feelings. And we don't want to hurt his feelings while being disrespectful now do we? 




 Sure thing. My two main devices are Android phone and android tablet. Usually during the day I'm with my phone, reading casually. At night I like using my tablet for better reading experience. Now, I'm not saying it's a huge issue by any means, but it's a real nice QOL. When I open my tablet, I need to skip all the posts that I already saw on my phone. 

I don't think it's something that needs to be solved on Reddit's level (i.e. using the API), it's a sync between BR (much like Amazon Kindle software that can sync the last page you read in each book across all devices in which the software is installed).

Anyway, maybe a nice feature for you think about in the future versions. I'm glad to see you read and respond to users. I have tried several apps and I keep coming back to BR, it gives me the best experience so keep doing what you doing. 




 Because when I googled "Mark Malik seemed to have a knack for making money" 2 hours ago, the first link was to this post.  




 Google the first line, click the first link, repeat. 














 It's also not a very easy listening album. Almost no hits. They play Money, Time and Brain Damage mostly on Classic Rock stations. I always felt like those songs became hits because the album was successful, and not the other way around (album sells well because of good songs in it). 




 I didn't say that I know this is the case, but it's naive to assume otherwise. Like you said, unless there's a way to sniff traffic (which is probably encrypted) and prove otherwise, why people assume Amazon doesn't know what's going on *their* devices?  




 I know that, like other people commented, a pro thief will steal your bike if he wanted to, regardless of your lock. However, you should lock your bikes properly against *casual* thieves, which are the majority: dishonest people passing by and see an opportunity.

Against them , what you need to do is:

1. Get a decent lock/chain that can't be cut easily with a cutter. Small U lock are great, but they also give you less flexibility. 

2. Get a massive lock, that isn't a combination lock.

3. Lock the bike to an object that can't be broken, cut or easily removed from the ground.

4. A combination of u lock and cable is good.

5. Use the U lock to wrap the object, the inside frame and the front wheel. Use the cable to wrap the object, back wheel, and rear triangle frame and maybe the chair if you have enough room below it to pass the cable.

 




 Some people are going too far to avoid traffic on their commute route.  




 I have the app installed on several devices, and I usually browse with visited posts hidden (on a side note, I find it much less convenient now that toggling this option is on the third menu level). When I switch to another device I need to skip the posts I already read. Is there a way to sync this?

Thanks. Awesome app. 




 I'm sorry, but you have to assume they have. Unless you completely block internet connection on your kindle, you have to assume that Amazon reads *everything* on your device, including your epub, pdf and text files. 

And just to add, they don't do anything with mobi/awz4 files, but I bet they are aware of their existence on the device. There's simply little they can do about it.

 I really wish more people knew about the Beatles.  




  My dog is sweet and loving, but if you grabbed her leg and twisted, she would bite you

And here's the thing, even if the dog just *feels* you gonna do that, it will bite. They operate on instincts. Even if you aren't aware that your body language is threatening, it can still be so in the eyes of the dog.  




 So you just found a way to feel superior to all three. 




 Rumor has it, the only reason Hitler didn't invade Russia before 1941 was because of an epic rap battle this guy had with the German soldiers on the border, claiming he had every right to be there and not make way. The minute he stopped rapping to get a drink, operation Barbarossa began. Can't even make this shit up.

  slow pace

I think people slowly realize, rightfully or not, that there's a non-zero chance he'll simply won't finish the series. He might publish another book, but overall, a possible outcome might be that the show will conclude the story. 

That realization leads to frustration.  




 yep, there loss.
