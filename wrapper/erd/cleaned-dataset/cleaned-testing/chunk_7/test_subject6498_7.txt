 "Yeah, well you've stopped torturing the pilot. Gotta help." 




 This is just as important as getting rid of fossil fuels. 

Large forests are what're going to heal this planet, even though it will take a long, long time. 




 Swim down and knock on the hatch.

(In Sweden we have a running tradition of telling jokes about stupid norwegians. They do the same about swedes) 




 That's not attacking the root of the problem. The right answer is you, the people should control your government. 
That's what democracy is.

 Bonobos for the win. 




 Ja, var r snn nr man behver den? 




 Be careful though. You could easily be attacked without noticing it before it's too late.
Also my tip. Find Jeremus. He will save you time and money since he is a decent levelled surgeon. Make sure to always have him last in your soldier list though as I think his effect ends when he is unconscious. 




 I'm not saying every reason. But if you consider that New York went so far as to pay for plane tickets to get rid of their homeless, you soon realize the problem must have been substantial.

 




 That's one way to treat a symptom.. Why not take a look at the disease that made them homeless? 




 I agree. Although Linda seems to let her emotions run wild even once in a while. I do the same, but it's a bit different when you are such a public figure.  




 When people get emotionally invested they gladly give money. But a system where health care is free for everyone, not just the one who get a lot of attention by going viral? That's un-American.

I'm glad he got help. But it's tragic to see sick people suffer just because they don't have enough money in a system that is rigged against them.  




 That already is a thing sadly.

 Sure but The Hobbit look terrible. Imagine watching both trilogies in ten years. LotR will look much, much better than The Hobbit will..
 




 Att g med i Nato skulle gra oss till en liten smpojk som gr med i de stora grabbarnas gng bara fr att man blir lite retad i skolan..

 It must feel nice to have that go-to excuse every time another country does something good.

That and that Europe is homogenous. That's why we can do good things... You think it has nothing to do with a government that works for the people? Always trying to do what they can to make the lives of their citizens better.
 




 Foocking casuals. 




 Dude. Awesome! Campaign is underrated as well. "Black Sails! A landing party!"  




 Also, their accent are awesome.

 Har inte sett kta Mnniskor men jag har hrt att den r bra.  

"Solsidan" r ganska rolig stundvis och har dessutom ngra av vra mest lskade komiker. 

Annars gillar jag Millenium-trilogin som finns p Netflix. Och bckerna r nnu bttre. 
Om du gillar ljudbcker kan jag rekommendera den trilogin upplst av Reine Brynolfsson.

 Taste is different. So many gets offended when someone doesn't like the same games as they do. 




 Why do you say it's unbalanced? It still has an active competetive community. 




 Today the people of Sweden got their tax rebates. And it's surprisingly common to hear men and women quote a scene from Robin Hood.
[Swedish version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-08tQxlrYiI)

The comments on the video is mostly about praising the rebate. Folks telling people how much they got back this year. 









 The soundtrack is on Spotify! The song names are.. Awesome..

"A Cat Named Mittens" 




 Nice! I havn't bought the Steam version since the AoE2 HD Edition had real problems with lag and it seems to be the same with AoM.

I might go for Voobly. I'm gonna drag some friends along as well. 




 Well, that's just my opinion. I know people who enjoy it, but if you compare it to AOE2 and AoM it kind of lacks depth which makes at least me sick of it after a couple of games. 




 Try forcing the resolution. 




 It said so in the script.  




 Age of Mythology deserves a lot more praise. A worthy sequel to Age of Empires 2, considering Age of Empires 3 was... Well lame. 




 And could possibly save lives. Worth it. I would say. 




 Send 15$ to an american friend who can donate for you. Or don't do it. I'm not gonna lead you towards a terrible crime. 




 As a swede I find your tipping culture absurd. Everywhere else you only tip in proportion to the quality of service and food. 

Why not raise the wage, and let tipping be the bonus?

 But hey, if you have a private email server that you have used alongside your official one while working for the US government. It's totally legal to erase every email from that if people found out about it?  Logical.. 




 Pick one that has a time period and/or a faction that you want to play. 
I haven't played Attila, but the rest of them are awesome and you just need to feel engaged in the glory of whatever faction you take to war.

 It's not hard to see where the inspiration to "Hunger Games" comes from. 




 Episode Ten: "Mother's Mercy"

Oh no. I don't think so.

Edit: Also, if they managed to pull off a sneak attack by Michelle Fairley, David and Dan are geniuses.

 I once bought a sweater with a zipper with a colored chinese looking mythical dragon stitched into the back. It was awesome and super expensive for me at the time. Sadly it got stolen at a party a few months after I bought it.
I have a picture of it here:

I remember the brand was "Komodo" or "Comodo" 

This was like 2008. Any chance of finding it? 




 **tl;dr**: muppet show where a muppet urinates in the shower. 


If someone can help me I will be your muppet for a day.
My "white whale" is a muppet show of some sorts that got recorded over my vhs tape of the episode of pokemon where ash meets Snorlax. (The tape is broken because of rewinds)

There was a scene with a muppet that was showering, and he peed in the shower and it was hilarious as a ten year old. I remember me and my cousin competing over who could hold their laughs the longest.

 




 Every child should grow up with an animal companion. So as to learn that animals are people too.  




 I think they are probably like humans. Some are friendly and some are evil bastards. 




 Really? This was a part of a popular kids-show called "FF" when I was a kid.  




 This. The Sandsnakes might be the worst portrayed characters of the show.  




 I see this everywhere. However they are not more sadistic than humans. 




 *Doctor Who

Sorry for having to be THAT person. 




 I loved this growing up. Doktor Mugg is a Swedish television series, named after the program's title character. The series takes place in the fictitious town Dasseborg (Outhouseburg) and revolves around toilet humor, mugg and dass being colloquial terms for toilet in the Swedish language. Other important main characters are Kapten Filling (Captain Skivvies) and Walter Closett.

Doktor Mugg tries to force the citizens to buy his invention "Pruttomobilen" ("The Fartmobile"), a mobile toilet.

**tl;dr**

The show is about a villain trying to make people buy his own product "The Fartmobile". 









 I don't think he is so much for income tax as a "wealth-tax".
Income tax is not the most efficient in accomplishing what he wants to do, for the exact reasons you mention here.

 I'd like to express my gratitude to that teacher. 




 One of the few that's beaten Super Mario Bros / Duck Hunt to NES. 




 Always believed this as well. Lab grown meat can't come fast enough. Mind you I'm not vegetarian, meat is too good. 

But soon we will realize the way we breed and eat isn't sustainable. There just have to come along an option that is better. (and cheaper)  




 That is timeless. And I suspect people will watch it forever.

 Probably money. The human nature of always wanting more gets into every aspect of every life thanks to money, and it corrupts everything.

 Yes, basically all the lost funds was fuel. 96% of the funds was recovered from my test.  




 Yes. Imgur doesn't want to follow my commands.  




 Made this to be able to recover my whole launch stage. Since I am an incompetent space planer I decided to make a rocket. It does it job and is quite powerful.

Funds lost is 27 252 per launch.

 Oh cool, so it's international then! 




 Your main point strikes true. Citizen United is a law made for the billionaires, not the presidential candidates. But it's not only GOP who's taking bribes, we need to remember that. 




 China'd probably be Asshai or something. 




 Thing is that he actually was the biggest smug asshole ever. Then shit happened and all of a sudden, he wasn't anymore.

 Take away the magic and it pretty much is Medieval Europe / Middle East. 




 Fire and Hype 




 obviously you get 80% of your original salary.  with a roof of around 4000$ / month. 
And my original response was to someone that stated 4000 we not a livable wage. Which is false. 4000 a month is a lot.  




 There could be more. Neutrinos hitting nerves in your brain for example.  




 If you haven't already, watch Princess Mononoke. Basically The Legend of Zelda by Studio Ghibli. Thank me later 




 She has even commented on it, so just stop what you're doing..  




 Regrettably I'm not.. She had a second secret email account on a separate private server whilst serving as Secretary of State. And that's a fact, easy to check out. Nothing mass-media likes to share very often. For obvious reasons.  




 I thought that was self explanatory...  




 And you think Democrats are better? Clinton has a fairly well documented history, and was really quick in deleting her secret emails on her server when it became public knowledge. 




 I've been there once, and the monkeys are really rude and childish. She seems to be made of the same stuff.. 




 I'm glad to hear it. Hope is alive.  




 All the while those responsible for the economic collapse on Wall Street still walks free. Not only that. Most of them still have their old jobs...  




 Too bad those who only watched the show didn't get the whole story though.
