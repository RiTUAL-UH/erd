I do the same thing in public when people talk.  If there is the tiniest mistake or stutter, I quickly point it out before they have a chance to remedy the error.  Everyone else always claps in approval when I do this.   

I type with one hand because I'm missing part of my dominant hand.  My hand has to move fast so I often make mistakes.  Thank you for pointing out another one of what I'm sure will be ripe future of errors.

    




 They'll be distracted for about 4 to 6 months, until their supply of Kim Jong-un tender-meat dwindles out, and they turn on the south koreans in their hunger.  

Thanks to marijuana, we now have zombies.  
 




 Except you wouldn't know any different. So North Korea might seem like the one thing that stands between you and the giant USA rape metalmonster.     




  If neanderthals still lived on earth I think we would consider them "human" even though we would acknowledge them as a separate species.

 Unless the curvature of space makes it so we both see each other on the broad side.   Maybe we are laying flat, next to each other, like two discs on a table.  

No doubt the massive black hole is bending space.  There was a reddit post about this just last week I think.

 Look bro... you're way to worked up over the masturbating issue.  

You don't gotta tell her you were masturbating.  

And correlation=/=causation.  

And erection could have presented a problem that was previously unseen without masturbating have caused it.   

Just go to the free clinic.  Use the internet.  Find where one is.   You're 17 not 5.  Be a grown up man and take care of your own penis.  Mommy doesn't own a penis and she doesn't need to take care of yours.   If she thinks you should not masturbate then she is giving poor medical advice anyway.   

And stop diagnosing yourself.  You're not a doctor.  So go find one.   




 Yup.  I'm antiwar now.   

As I'm finished here in the Philippines, I plan to start a new company.  Clean room growing conditions.  "Medical Grade" High quality custom designed genetic strains.   Mostly just waiting on it to become legal federally first.     




 In GA, you're required to pass a standardized test to graduate.  At least you were in the 1990s.  

It didn't matter if you had all the credits and a 4.0 GPA, no test, no graduation. 

I remember a few challenging it, even then, when the standardized test craze really took hold.   




 You don't need to tell her you were masturbating.  All you need to do is ask to visit the doctor for a private matter.  She will likely guess it has to do with your penis.  If she presses you for information, you just tell her, "If the doctor feels that you need to know, then he will tell you."   Just so you know, you're entitled to medical privacy and the doctor is required to keep your discussion confidential  as long as you aren't placing yourself in danger.  

I don't think you should assume it's from masturbating.  Especially if there is no pain because injury in your penis would likely cause pain.   I think the doctor should be the one to tell you what it is.  Not your mom, or your guilt.

 If they want to make voat.co more appealing, they gotta stop doing that.  A lot of users still use both.  And they need to cast a wider net than the low hanging "reddit sux" crowd.  

It's like voat.co can't figure out if it wants to be a reddit copycat or the anti-reddit.   What's for sure, is that many users there are attempting to figure out how to be not like reddit, whilst circle jerking a shitload about how they aren't reddit.

 When I lived in GA, I knew a guy that was a KKK member.  I slapped a "Proud supporter of the NAACP" sticker on his truck.   


I don't know if it's related but the next time I saw his truck the sticker was gone but it was all dented and busted up all over.   

Musta not noticed and parked it at a big meeting.

Word from the wise.  You haven't seen nothing yet for pain.  Wait a couple of months and then the phantom limb will start to set in.  

Don't fall into the trap and let the doctors string you out on narcotics.  They will love to try and prescribe vicodin and oxycotin and all that shit.  But it doesn't work.   You just have to ride it out.  Maybe gabapentin to take the edge off.

 I am currently living in the rural Philippines, which is not unlike rural Indonesia.  

You are correct, most cases go unfounded.  Even the doctors here are of poor quality.  They will diagnose a small child with "weak lungs" and then place that child on anti-tuberculosis medicine. When all the child had was a cough from a chest cold.  

So... even when they do go see a doctor, it's likely he isn't going to know what the fuck is wrong with them.  The standard of medical knowledge is like from 1913.

Most of the time they say "it kinda gave me a headache, but it looked cool sometimes"

 I can't load that link here in the philippines.  But I do remember reading something about if the dog is wagging the tail to the left it means nervous... or maybe I have it backwards.  I read that about a year ago i think.

 Returning alive is bitter sweet.  Especially if you survived injury or loss of limb and have continued pain, each and every second of your life.   And because of the concussions, you can never really be sure what your loved ones told you, just one hour ago.

 Bingo. 




  Only works if you ~~can get approved~~ are willing to accept a high interest rate for the loan.


FTFY.   You can always find some shitty lender that will give you the loan at a 23+% interest rate.   They'll even lend to people with shitty 525 credit score.   Even as low as 480.   

I worked in one of those lending offices for 3 months and then I quit because it was too sad.  So so very sad.  The ruining of lives.


So fuck the banks.    Fuck em.


 




 Nope.  

I think there is some way you can do it with chapter 13.   Which has you still paying them.   But you'd have to check with a lawyer on that.  

I don't think you can completely discharge them with ch. 7. 

I could be wrong. 




 Oh sure.  As I said to someone else, don't ask me if it makes you a piece of shit.  But the bankers are pieces of shit. 


And anyhow,  the bank gets to write it off on taxes and we the people foot the bill for our Constitutional right.   

So if I have been paying for others to utilize this, I don't really feel bad about utilizing it myself.  
 




 That's why you put some of into a car and an idiot purchase like a 4K television (that is 120hz but only supports 30 fps hdmi).  

Then you just look like an idiot to the judge. Who will grant you your I'm an idiot bankruptcy constitutional right.

If it's your only car you can even keep that in the bankruptcy.  


All this is legal... don't ask me if it makes you a piece of shit, though.   

The bankers are pieces of shit so I think it's moot.

 Kids grow up real nice, on their own, when the parents are never home. 




 I don't think it means that at all.   I think it forces us to constantly adapt, to survive off ingenuity,  to constantly renew and grow our knowledge.

 What?  Iran has a very strong and battle experienced military.   I have no doubt they can easily secure their borders.  They would fall to an assault from the USA or NATO but not without giving them one hell of a black eye first. 




 OK, but if they build nukes, wouldn't it be better to bring them into the fold as an equal, rather then letting a rejected and excluded state develop one unregulated and with angst? 

Thank you for the in depth response. 









 Wow... a fatalist eh?  

I believe that necessity is the mother of all invention.   So I don't doubt we will transition from oil just fine.  

 




 I will repeat this later and take all the credit. 




 Right but none of those are a basic component of the majority of our item's, whilst plastic is.  

I'm trying to find it but there was a car within the last 5 or 10 years that sported non petroleum based plastics.  It's was just a gimmick for environmentalists but it shows we can do it.   

We can make plastic from cannibus... it could be an economic boom if it weren't for our government getting in the way.
 




 Tetsuo: The Iron Man.... is that you? 




 It really is a shame we are still using petroleum for plastic.   There are plenty of other sources for plastic that are ripe for development.  Including plants.  I believe there was a car recently that sported plant based plastics for interior pieces. 




 When a company enjoys record profits for decades but cannot survive a year without laying people off, we need to examine why our system is failing.    

We need to stop letting shareholders handle employee management.
