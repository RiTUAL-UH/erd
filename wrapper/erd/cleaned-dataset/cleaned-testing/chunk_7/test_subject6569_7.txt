 Wait, why not?

If we assume that poverty is the deciding factor in homicides, and consider that while 1/4 of the black population lives in poverty, only 1/13 of the white population does (using /u/AsthmaticMechanic 's numbers here), why doesn't it make sense that there would be a lot more black on black murders than white on white?

/u/idledrone6633 pointed out that there are more poor white people than that there are poor black people, /u/AsthmaticMechanic put these numbers into perspective by looking at them in terms of percentages. 

If /u/idledrone6633 's argument was that poverty cannot be a factor because there are more poor white people than poor black people, then /u/AsthmaticMechanic 's post certainly answered his argument. 




 If they are trying to say that then they're whitewashing history. 

There's an argument to be made for the reason being primarily economical (because of the degree of the industry's reliance on slave labor) and only secondarily racially motivated (dehumanization of 'the other'), but if anyone's trying to say that the main cause of the war had nothing to with slavery, they're fooling themselves! 




 Ooh, well put!

I'll remember that one for the next time this comes up! 




 Thanks!

/u/sembello: rebuttal? 




 Hey Kevin!

Don't worry about it!  All the best with your personal situation, and thanks for all the excellent work that you do! 




 Fuck, how did I not catch that mosf obvious of connections?! 




 Gotta say, your response made me chuckle a bit. I sort of imagine you as Ignatius J. Reilly from 'A Confederacy of Dunces'.

 and will change the laws

Well, I'm sure our neighbouring galaxy will do away with those pesky laws of physics for you, no problem. If that does not work, you can always ask the Greek pantheon, or maybe Nicolas Flamel. 




 I'm not knocking you for your vision, you are free to believe in whatever you wish. All I'm saying is that this impulse isn't exactly a new thing. Humanity has sought ways to live forever since its beginnings. Early on these desires were mostly sated through religion ("everlasting life through our Lord and Savior"), before slowly becoming a scientific pursuit (Alchemy, anyone?) progressing towards more reliable scientific endeavors, genetic modification, for instance.

In the last couple of decades there has been vast progress in halting the process of aging. The human life span has never been as long, and it will grow longer in an exponential fashion.

Yet, let's recognize that we're in the business of prolonging life, not transcending it. In the face of the inevitable decay of the universe, we're no further than Moses with his stone tablets, or some mad scientists in his lab in the 16th century.

It does not exist now, but may likely, if it take ten thousand or ten million years what of it? If it comes from Earth or deep in Andromeda, who cares.

This is the same impulse that drives religion. No proof, just the stubborn belief that we're special, that we are the only thing since the beginning of time that has just a beginning, and not an end.

I'm not saying that it's wrong or right, I could not possibly know that. All I'm saying is that it has nothing to do with science, and everything to do with the desperation that mankind has felt ever since evolution gifted/cursed us with self-awareness, and thus the awareness of our own demise.

Personally, I believe there's a lot of value in recognizing our own mortality. For me, a perfect day spent with my loved ones is that much more significant because I know there won't be an infinite number of them. I know that this way of reasoning doesn't work for everyone though. 

 




 Believing in a space where laws of nature and logic no longer apply and you get to live forever?

Congratulations, you have just founded what we like to call 'a religion'. Make it a good one!

 




 I just find it adorable that people think this level of outrage will last. Give it a week, discussion on the topic will be down 95%.

It has *never* not been that way.  




 Unless you implement reddit's favorite method for population control: eugenics ^^TM . 




 Don't count on it. Even if the technological progress allows for longevity, there is no such thing as "forever" in a decaying universe.

So even if science figured out how to stop all mechanisms of aging in the next few decades )(color me sceptic), all you could possibly hope for is to live a very, very, very, very, very long life.  




 And there one is! Amazing!

It took me less than 10 seconds to find this in your comment history:

 Nevermind the fact that the current state of the USA has it that by default men are not US citizens unless they sign up for the draft. Women got all the rights and none of the associated responsibilities, and thats just the way these poisonous little radical fucktards like it.

That's a pretty neat magic trick, /u/kgtx!
