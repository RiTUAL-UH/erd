 She is so cute I can forgive the stupidity. 




 The issue in here is that you are not allowed to talk about those issues freely without getting nazi card. It is also immigration problem when you look at crime statistics and people behind them. Well it is also fault of immigration integration.

Also it is not miniority opion anymore. People start to see issues in their daily life and when they try to talk about it or bring the issues up they are called racist. And because they are called racist they dont want to talk about it anymore. Since nobody is freely talking about issues anymore, there is no healthy public conversation, instead people will vote somebody like "Finns Party". Where one of the leading figures is convicted of "provocation against people" (not really sure about the translation). So instead healthy conversation and actual tackling the issues the pro-immigration people has pushed us to this sitation where most people voted most anti-immigrant party ever. 




 Hooray, immigrants are such forward pushing force for nations. Seriously, people wake up, it is not rasist to call out the issues immigrants bring in, it is statistical fact and realism. 




 There is lot hot asian chicks, do it man! 




 Most of the scene groups run their own FTP servers. It is also extreme hard to get in those servers without proper referee. They have some next level security and rules too. 




 This still dont do same things as tiling-wm. Tmux is cool and works fine with terminal apps but try to do same with browser or any other app. Btw does OS X have multiple desktops? 




 Ihan validi pointti, mutta luulis ympristnriskien hoitamisen onnistuvan alle 100millin. 




 I still dont get it. So because Sweden is paying more to immigrants than Finland, we are not allowed to complain of the level of support we give to immigrants? I think you just want to brag, but I dont want to live in the country that has same immigrant problems as Sweden got right now.

EDIT:
Difference is that you guys are proud of your immigrant status and how "human" you act, but we dont really give a shit. 




 I dont see why my comment has anything to do with you being swedish, but i can see you are acting like proper swedish :P 




 This will be cheaper anyway, because we already pay LOT for immigrants. Sometimes it is even more than regular citizens get and it has been criticized and it is one of the reasons for "Finns Party" success.

The problem with current system is that there is too many different type of social security. System needs lot people to figure out  who is allowed to have social security and how much. Calculations show we can have savings with new system because we can drop all the burocracy. 




 So is IRC, FTP and DC++, they are just the places where the actual releases come to torrent sites. 




 There was also Napster, Limewire and Kazaa?? :P 




 And FTP or DC++ does not? 




 What? Where are you from? Sound like stone age system to me. 




 We europeans like to believe in facts and it is statistical fact muricans are fat, get over it. 




 In sock!

Edit: socks has always been popular way to save money, it has done by multiple old people over years, you think your wisdom is greater than thousands of old people? 




 What if I told there was piracy before torrent sites. 




 Yeah, I was thinking OpenBSD router :3 




 Lievsti erikoista politiikkaa. STX telakkaa ei kuitenkaan pelastettu ja silloin argumenttina oli ett ei valtio voi pelastaa yrityksi. Nyt kuitenkin ollaan pelastamassa talvivaaraa. Herkin kysymys johtuuko tm siit ett Paula Lehtomen puolisolla on talvivaarassa kiinni 350k. 




 But it runs openBSD? 




 "Dont put it in the frontpage of reddit"

 I dont know but in here hipster is used as insult nothing else. 




 Came for box, stayed for legs 




 The level of shit they put in the food is so bad they cant make it look normal anymore? 




 I dont see why any programming language has anything to do with hipsters except JS. I was thinking something like haskell or scala. 




 Where is functional languages? 




 But passion takes you even further! 




 Well how much 120k $ investment in stock market makes in 7years if invested right? 




 It is not sliced wrong, you just have stupid stereotypes. You should see this bread as unique invidual that made your day better and gave you karma. 




 So John Hurt is hurt? 




 I dont see anything hipster in this, please dont associate linux usage with hipster shit. 




 Next time there is jehovah in my doorstep I tell them I am already in vim cult.

 What if that person would have been deaf? 




 Even in Russian police asks money first before they beat you. 




 It is not cat but take upvote! 




 It is quite shock so many still use IE in 2015. Specially shocking it is when you know there is some big organisations that use old IE 8 just because they have some program that needs IE 8 to work. 




 You know jails are too confortable when they offer opera. 




 I think this was quite accurate expression about Linux users.
