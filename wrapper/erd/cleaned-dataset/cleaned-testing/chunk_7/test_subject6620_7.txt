 Sorry. I know a guy, but he's Inuit. 




 Not sure what the problem is, just dry that thing out and hang it up in the family room. 




 I was just waiting for Augustus Gloop to pop up in that water.  




 ...and your friend needs to be tested for diabetes. 




 amazing. Thanks! 




 This Special and Season 2 of Maron on Christmas Eve! Really hope ol' Freckleface can make an appearance on that show one day. Maron + Burr = Genius. 




 I do not like Nordstrom. Regin is more versatile, and there are other Rockford guys that could provide more of an offensive spark if needed. So what's the point of even calling him up? 




 Well, feeling better about the three goal lead, not sure why the trend is developing to back down with a two goal lead. (See game against Caps, See game against Flames) 




 Will Brandmeier be harassing random Wisconsinites on his podcast? Somehow, that doesn't seem quite as fun.  




 Listening on the WGN app (delayed)... Update: SHOWWWWWTIMMEEEEE! 




 How 'bout a little SHOWTIME in this shootout!?!? 




 Well, I thought that was funny. Have an upvote. 




 I really hope that Judd Sirott can get a shot in the play-by-play booth some day. The guy has so much enthusiasm, and does tons of homework before the game. I listened to him do play-by-play with the Wolves during that period of time that the Hawks were shit. He was electric with Brian Noonan. 




 Well, let's not pretend that Foley and Eddie O are the greatest.
 
Olczyk: "Here's a tip for all you young hockey players, see how Johnny Toews has his stick on the ice, you have a much higher percentage chance of scoring with your stick ON the ice." 

Foley: "And with that goal the Hawks should take some momentum into the TURD period."

Then... 30 seconds of silence 




 Racconto the worst? I've been eating that stuff for years; the Pagliacci brand isn't bad either. Pick some up at [Serelli's!]( http://serrellisfinerfoods.com/) We used to buy jars of that stuff every Christmas Eve, there's no way that cheap-ass Centrella brand is any better.  




 Julie Unruh. She ain't messing around.

What's so hard to understand here, good sir?  




 I suggest that you do some research about the year 1968. It was a huge turning point which led to years of many Black Chicagoans distrusting law-enforcement (among other things), and many White Chicagoans feeling unsafe in predominately Black neighborhoods. At the time these feelings were justifiable, but they've persisted for decades.

 Do we really need to keep referring to Carcillo as an "enforcer?" Yes, Rosenbloom calls him an "agitator" in the article, and that is what Carcillo is. Yet I've seen a dozen articles since last weekend stating that the Hawks have brought back their "enforcer."

Is Carcillo really going to police play on the ice? If a John Scott-type boards one of our guys, what is he going to do about it other than make a bunch of noise and take an undisciplined penalty? 

From what I remember Carcillo's fights were usually retaliatory when he was here.

 




 START A SORRY RECEIVER LIKE CRABTREE, AND YOU KNOW THE RESULT YOU GON' GET!!!  




 Sanders. It's his week to get in the endzone... (hopefully). Can I just say that he and Forte need to score a touchdown this week or I'll have an aneurism.  




 ya know... come talk to me when you are an Algerian soap opera star.

 Hello, career gurus.

I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.

My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.

I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there).
My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).

Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down:
Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k
My Endorsement: Probably $12k

I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times.
I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)

With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks! 









 Hello! I wanted to gain some perspective on the value of an LBS1 endorsement as a job candidate. I have an IL Type 09 certificate with a grade 6-12 designation and a focus in social studies. (...yes, only social studies...)

Would doing a 9 month endorsement program for LBS1 increase my chances of getting a classroom job next fall? Or, is a position as a Special Ed teacher really dependent on Special Ed licensure?

I have 3 years experience with students with special needs in the clinical setting.

Thanks in advance, and keep up the amazing work and dedication!  




 Dear someguy, May smokin Jay spread the wealth, and may the Forte be with you.  




 CAN WE CUT THE LEASH ON FORTE, ALREADY? TIME TO DECIMATE THE CHEESEHEADS! 




 Cooks will see more looks while Floyd is left in the void.  




 the one about his vision of the apocalypse is hilarious, and needs to be made into a movie with "the barely recognizable Michael Richards" 









 Not to mention that you can get a slice of deep dish pizza the size of a dinner plate with no wait at all. (Which would otherwise be a 40 min experience at Giordano's) 




 Eh. I like the way things turned out. We can still kick ourselves for taking Skille over Kopitar in '05. There are few guarantees in the draft. After Ovi and Malkin, there is a huge drop-off in this draft class.  




 "Rex is our Quarterback." 




 Is it just me or is that Windsor looking a little off CENTAH? 




 Here's to hoping Harbaugh has an epic meltdown after this one! 




 Ha. When I lived in DC I'd drive down to Mt.Vernon, VA to buy Pastorelli's pizza sauce. "Imported" from the West Side of Chicago. 




 Marconi and Racconto are the only acceptable giardenerias. Well done. 




 Gotta love ol' Billy Red Face during hockey season. One month away, but I'll definitely be tuning in for this psycho. 




 In the spirit of Boston taking this title... [Here's one of the most hilarious anti-Blackhawks rants ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZ4CTfA6pQ) Start around 1:30, just about died of laughter around 3 mins in. 




 Great tribute. We always have bets to see what round my Dad will draft Robbie Gould. He's grabbed him as early as the third. He restrained himself until the ninth  this year. 




 Pssh. I'd expect nothing less than Murray Craven. 




 As is Byfuglien! No hate for Daze, really unlucky with his back problems, however. 




 Was there for our first meet up, out of town Sunday but looking to get back out there soon. 




 Or if you're considering Championships in the last 30 years it goes: 

Hawks, Hawks, Sox, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bears. 




 My wife would probably get a job in a few weeks after graduating. She's great at networking and communicating with professionals. In fact, there is a few schools that have already inquired about hiring her in the short amount of time she has decided to leave the company, but she's been inhibited by the fact that she doesn't have a teaching license. 

I'd have to work harder for sure, but my track record is good and getting an endorsement in Special Ed should help my chances. It's just that the Chicago area teaching job market is completely flooded with people like me, so the endorsement would hopefully set me apart. Part of me wants to explore the job market in other places (like her home state of Florida) where prospects seem better.  




 Oh, I'll never miss DC or taking 90mins to drive 6 miles.
