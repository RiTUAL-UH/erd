 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ENJOYING THE POST. I JUST CHECKED YOU OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND REDDIT FOR A LONG WHILE (ATLEAST DIDN'T MAKE ANY POSTS OR COMMENTS) ASSUMING YOU'RE NEW TO [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/), I WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT LOWERCASES ARE NOT SOMETHING WE APPRECIATE AROUND THIS SUB.. (I WAS GENTLE WHILE WRITING THAT, ACTUALLY WE FUCKING ABHOR, LOATHE, AND HATE THE GODDAMN LOWERCASE LETTERS WITH ALL OF OUR FUCKING HEARTS.)

AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE AN ASPIRING WRITER (IF I'M NOT WRONG). DO SHARE SOME OF YOUR WORKS HERE IF YOU THINK THEY ARE RELATED TO WHAT THIS SUB STANDS FOR. IF NOT YOU CAN PM ME THE LINKS. I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER TOO SO I WOULD TRY TO READ THEM. ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR WRITING.)

GO KICK-ASS. 




 The collection contains short poetic/prose pieces.. I'm an aspiring writer, and sometimes I pen my heartfelt words on Tumblr and other social media. I've collected some of them that I've written recently, around some 25 short works.

Art is something that intrgues me with its grandeur. It makes me think better and feel more lively when I do my writing. So, I would love to see my writings blended with beautiful illustrations. If anyone is interested in this, please PM me your email id and I shall mail you the document containing my works.

(Please note that I won't be using your art work for any kind of money earning, so I won't be able to offer you any money in exchange to the work you do. This is purely out of passion for the art.)

Thank you.
 




 Ok. Thanks for clarifying the doubt. 




 I have something for you. I too am still a guy who can not understand poetry well.. I needed English prose translation of epic poetry (such as Paradise Lost) that was already written in English. I'm that bad.. (also English is not my native, I'm from India) But here is the catch: Poetry, when felt and enjoyed, tastes as good as honey.. I'm not kidding. I don't understand most poetry and yet I keep reading it now and then, for it has some jewels written in its sentences, sentences that standout as quotes.. I read poetry especially to dig out such sentences even if I don't understand what is going on in the entire poem. I do this because I am not prepared to miss the sentences like: 

*"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."*
just because I don't understand poetry (by the way the above are the closing lines from John Keats' *Ode on a Grecian Urn.*)


But I also mostly enjoy Edgar Allan Poe's poetry very well.. I fell in love with poetry itself only when I read Poe's short poetry, primarily, *Eldorado.*



**Eldorado**

Gaily bedight, 

A gallant knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

Had journeyed long,

Singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.




But he grew old-

This knight so bold-

And o'er his heart a shadow

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado.




And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow-

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be-

This land of Eldorado?"




"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the Shadow,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied-

"If you seek for Eldorado!"







And another poem by Edgar Allan Poe has the following lines, which is what interested me to look into Poe in the first place:




*All that we see or seem*

*Is but a dream within a dream.*



And I prefer short poetry over long ones.. *Mary Olivers* is a new poet that I'm planning to look into soon this year. 




 Last year I read Peter Ustinov's *Loser.* I felt extremely happy when I reached the last page. When I finished the book, it felt like I came out of a boring place with a relief that came from knowing I don't have to go back to it ever again. 




 Hmm.. I'm pretty sure wands aren't involved in apparation. I don't remember anybody using a wand while apparating. I guess we need some expert's opinion here. 




 I felt extremely dissatisfied when the Dumbledore's Funeral (chapter 'Phoenix Lament') was not there in the film. Albus completely deserved that respect, but David Fucking Yates didn't think so! 




 But nobody uses a wand to apparate, do they?

THAT'S FOR NOW FROM VOLUME 1. THESE ARE THE WORDS OF OUR OWN FELLOW BROTHERS HERE.. HOPE YOU LIKE THEM. LET THEM PUMP YOUR FUCKING GUTS UP WHEN YOU ARE IN A FUCKING NEED.
 




  MY OTHER DREAM IS FOR THIS SUB TO HIT TEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS. GOD DAMN THAT WOULD BE MOTIVATING.

THAT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME.. I WANT IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART. I'M TRYING MY BEST TOWARDS THAT AS WELL. 




  I'M GOING TO FINISH KHAN ACADEMY MATH THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. EDUCATION IS PRICELESS.

THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND YES EDUCATION IS PRICELESS.

 IM SO PUMPED FOR LIFE

I GUESS I TOO AM. THANKS.


 




  I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAIL AROUND THE WORLD AND EXPERIENCE ALL THE DIFFERENT CULTURES I CAN (AND MAYBE HUNT SOME PIRATES IN SOMALIA BECAUSE FUCK PIRATES)

MOD BROTHER, NOW THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT PLOT FOR A NEW TV SERIES OR A MOVIE OR A FUCKING AWESOME NOVEL. YOU AND YOUR WIFE SAILING ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHILE PROTECTING PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING TROUBLED BY FUCKING PIRATES. YOU BOTH CAN BE REAL BADASSES IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS. 




  MY DREAM IS THAT IF I KEEP DOING MY ABSOLUTE BEST EVERYDAY THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO SORT IT OUT AS I GO.

THANK YOU BROTHER FOR THE RESPONSE. YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS IS VERY INSPIRING. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AS YOU MARCH AHEAD TOWARDS THAT BEAUTIFULLY MYSTERIOUS DESTINY OF YOURS. 




 IT IS SO FUCKING RARE THAT ONE WOULD SPEAK OF THEIR DREAMS IN LIFE FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART. LET US DO THAT TODAY HERE IN OUR FAVOURITE GODDAMN SUB.. LET'S SHARE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT WE FUCKING WANT TO BE, WHAT WE FUCKING WANT TO DO BEFORE OUR TIME IS FUCKING DONE IN THIS WORLD. ALSO TELL WHAT YOU ARE FUCKING DOING RIGHT NOW TO REACH THAT DREAM.

I WANT TO BE A GODDAMN GREAT WRITER. I WANT TO BE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOVELIST. BUT ENGLISH IS NOT MY FUCKING NATIVE LANGUAGE. I'M FROM INDIA. SO I'M READING BOOKS AND ALSO PRACTICING MY WRITING SKILLS BY WRITING SHORT STORIES IN ENGLISH. I'VE ALL THESE REALLY COOL IDEAS IN MY MIND AND I WANT TO PUT THEM IN MY WORDS. I'VE TAKEN UP THE JOURNEY IN THAT DIRECTION.

NOW, BROTHERS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS?

 




 Andy Weir's short story, [The Egg](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html), reflects this perfectly. 




 It was midnight and I was hungry. (telling)

*It was 2AM. My messenger on the Facebook chat window was beeping, usual good night messages probably, but it can wait.* I thought as I made my way into the kitchen to dig out anything edible that was brought in by me when I wasn't such a lazy idiot as I'd been since morning. 

 




  A fist clenched, then unclenched slowly.

Perfect.. He just became angry and then he tried controlling himself. I just *saw* that in your words..  




 Cool 




 You just really showed.. Thanks :) 




 Yes, definitely one of the most powerful moments shown in words... And I was just making fun of myself :) 




 Thank you so much for the response :) 




 Long back I discovered a [writing advice from Chuck Palahniuk on 'showing, and not telling'](http://1000wordseveryday.tumblr.com/post/54758529019/writing-advice-by-chuck-palahniuk-in-six) here. It had been an immediate help for something that I was doing then. I would really like to know more of such tips and techniques. If any of you guys have any resources (articles or anything) about *"show, don't tell"* rule of writers, please share them here. It would be an awesome help :) 




 I won't deny their iconicity.. I was merely pointing out my apparently mundane memory power :P 




 I'll tell you the names of the books I didn't like:

* The Divine Invasion
* The Man Who Japed

No fun reading those two really. Disappointed. But nevertheless something about PKD makes me feel interested in his works. I've got lots and lots more to try still. 




 how about naming it "rBooks" as a tribute to this sub??? 




 The way the book ends is pretty deep.. Although I don't remember the names of the characters, I can never forget how the protagonist must've felt when he points that gun at the back of his friend's head. I will always remember that. 




 Ubik is said to be similar to Inception film... I'm quite excited that there is such a book since I loved that film. This year I've plans to pick up his short stories. I've seen films based on  upon PKD's stories, namely *Minority Report* and *The Adjustment Bureau*.. Since then I'm interested in reading his short stories. 




 I'm from India too.. What MissMumbai pointed out here is a true superstition in our country.. There were instances during my childhood where friends used to swear on education and all that stuff... It was fun. 




 It's good to laugh... Watch TV series *The Big Bang Theory* and you might even die laughing. It's that good. 




  Named after how many people remember that Nelson Mandela died ages ago in prison, except that never happened.

Who are those people that remember him dying in prison?? How do they know that he died there?? Was there official news in the papers or were they also sharing prison with him?  




 I observed lot of people talking of *Mandela Effect* in this post.. What actually is Mandela Effect?? 




 Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking.

And he kicked its ass like a boss!

Thank you so much for the article, dan17555. 









 "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." -Albert Einstein

It's very encouraging to hear something like that from such a genius. 




 The following is my favourite quote that talks of similar stuff:

"The future is a choice between what's right and what's easy." -Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 




 Well noted. 




 I showed this to a friend of mine and he said that the OP can impress can any girl with his drawing skills.... Lucky fellow OP!! 




 unfuckingbelievable! 









  When you're little and you think there's a monster under your bed, you usually run to your parents. Because you see them as infallible human beings and trust implicitly that they're capable of handling whatever horrible creature is under your bed. 
 Harry never had that. He had to handle his own monsters. And Voldemort is no different.

These closing lines of your analysis are deeply insightful. Can't deny that. Awesome :) 




  What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.

This one was [attributed to Henry David Thoreau.](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/henrydavid145971.html) 




  We are practically living in science fiction

Yeah.. I feel this sometimes... 




 I just installed WriteMonkey.. but I couldn't access any sounds in the program... There is a 'sounds' folder with some sound types in it, but I didn't find any option to access them in Preferences. If you know of how to access sounds in WriteMonkey please help. 




 As you've said that the book is free till Friday I was just trying to download it to my Kindle.. but it says something like $8...?? Why was it not free?? Or is the kindle edition not available for $0.00 in the Indian Amazon market?? 




 THAT WOULD BE A FUCKING GREAT HONOUR, MOD.  




 Thanks :) 




 Congratulations for the achievement.. I would like to know how many pages does the book spans into? 

(also did I say it correctly when I said 'spans into'??  I am from India. English is not my native.. I too am learning to write!) 




 Thanks for the information :) 




 I often wonder how writers use typewriters, which doesn't offer the features of deleting something and retyping it, or clearing off a printed sentence or editing it.. much like a computer keyboard does. To do any of these on an actual typewriter, it would waste lot of paper, right? So, how do writers manage to use them instead of a keyboard or a word document where they don't have to waste an entire paper for every typo or a change in words or sentences they decide to make?? 

But I want to get the feel of a typewriter and see what's there.. Is there any software that combines the feel of a typewriter alongside providing the features of a keyboard? 









 I had always liked the concept of this book where the two look alikes from distinct lifestyles swap their appearances and unfortunately it stretches too far and brings in bigger changes in their lives than they've asked for.. I wanted to read the book and so picked it up last month. But to my surprise I discovered that all the characters in the book are speaking archaic English langauge. 

So the book is seeming very tough and an extrememly slow read, and it's tough to concentrate on the plot. Because of all this my excitement for the book is dwindling.

I really wish *The Prince and the Pauper* was written in normal/modern English :( 









 *Outliers* is undoubtedly the best of all his books.. Oh what a grand non-fiction book it is! 




  Do not go into that good night,

Do not go **gentle** into that good night... the most important word was missing. 




 :) :) 




 :) :) 




 I never really liked the book covers that have something like real pictures on them... 




  i always saw the harry/hermione dynamic more brother/sister

My thoughts exactly... 




 If you look at *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* there is something called as Time Turner which is used by Hermione to attend extra classes, it is also the object which Dumbledore advices Harry to use by the end of the book to travel back in time and set things right.. There is not any explanation given as to the working of time turner itself but the story just carries on with its help and presence. So, maybe you can simply come up with something like that and take your story forward.. And also there is a book by Stephen King called *11/22/63* where a teacher travels back in time to stop the assassination of JFK.. I haven't read it yet but you might wanna check that out once.. And most important of all is not what you used to time travel, but how well the plot is woven.. If the story is griping enough, then audience wouldn't care about how it's done.. Didn't you watch Chris Nolan's *Inception* film.. Nobody bothers about what that dream machine was all about but what they do there after entering into the dream realm... So, it depends not on what your character uses to time travel but what he does after time traveling that would interest some category of people, a category that readers like me belong to.

(I'm saving this post.. I would love to see others people's views on your question.) 




 I'm a guy who loves to read quotes on many things that interest me.. but when it came to quotes on 'Writing' I haven't come across many. It would be lovely if you guys can post your favourite quotes on *Writing* here. Thanks :)

I love this quote:

*"If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it."* -Toni Morrison 




 Yeah... and moreover the chemistry that a boyfriend and girlfriend should be having between them is completely missing between Harry and Hermione... They're just like any usual great male and female friends.. but such a chemistry was always there between Ron and Hermione. They just have it... I think this whole thing of Hermione and Harry came up just because Emma Watson is extremely beautiful and that we all have a knack for pairing up the best looking girl only with the main protagonist of a story and not with his best friend. 




 Ok.. Apparently I overreacted too! 

Thanks for the clarifying article link...  




 I hate to read about these plot twists...!! And I don't want to see Hermione paired with Harry... The way it is in the book is the best already.. Let's keep it that way.. Over and done.. Although I love J.K.Rowling I didn't like her coming out and telling that Dumbledore is gay and that she thought of killing Ron's character and now this one... I just don't like such stuff. This just ruined my Saturday. 














 Thanks, mate, for the encouragement :) 




 Recently I've started enjoying porn related stuff less and less with each passing day... It has started to seem mechanical. Also I'm not doing much in my other chosen goals of life as well. Now I felt like taking a break from porny stuff and come back here. I love masturbating, but now I'm not enjoying my PMO sessions much they've become monotonous. I guess that's because I've taken too much liberty. Now I'm gonna control my thoughts. 




 DEAR MODS.. ALSO WE SHOULD MIND THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS SUB. WE GOTTA CHANGE THE FUCKING BACKGROUND OF OUR SUB REGULARLY (LIKE [/R/INTERSTELLAR](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/)).. WE SHOULD MAKE IT FEEL ALIVE..

ALSO IT IS TIME WE PUNCH THE THREE FACES STARING AT US FROM THE HEADER AND PUT MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES THERE INSTEAD... OR MAYBE THE QUOTES THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THE POSTS THAT WE HAVE HERE FROM OUR FELLOW BROTHERS.. 

ALSO LET'S CREATE A CATCHPHRASE EVERY MONTH AND LET THE BROTHERHOOD SPREAD THE WORD... SIMPLY WRITING POSTS WON'T BRING PEOPLE OR MAKE US FAMOUS. WE GOTTA REDEFINE OUR LIVING HERE.. WE GOTTA MAKE OUR LIFESTYLE FUCKING ADDICTIVE FOR OTHERS THAT THEY CAN'T RESIST US. THEY HAVE TO COME TO US ANTICIPATING A NERVE WRENCHING CHANGE IN THEIR GODDAMN LIVES.
 




 THE SURE SHOT WAY TO HAVE A COMPLETENESS IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IS TO ALWAYS FUCKING DO SOMETHING.. EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. DONT SIT IDLE FOR MORE THAN 300 SECONDS AT A STRETCH. ALWAYS KEEP DOING SOMETHING. BE IT READING SOMETHING OR REMEMBERING A MATH TRICK YOU LEARNED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE FOR THAT MATTER.. BUT ALWAYS DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES YOU A STEP FORWARD ON YOUR DREAM PATH. IF NOTHING ELSE TURNS UP IN YOUR MIND, JUST SIT AND LISTEN TO YOUR BREATH... MEDITATE.

REALIZING YOUR POTENTIAL BY EXHAUSTING YOURSELF LIKE FUCK BY DOING THE STUFF THAT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU IN THE PURSUIT OF YOUR GODDAMN DREAM.. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FUCKING ALIVE. 

REMEMBER THIS EVERY GODDAMN MOMENT THAT YOU FEEL YOURE WASTING TIME. WHEN WE DO THIS WE CAN SLEEP PEACEFULLY. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS, A PEACEFUL SLEEP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS SEEN MUCH IN PEOPLE, RICH AND POOR ALIKE. TO SLEEP PEACEFULLY WITH A HAPPY MIND IS ONE OF THE BEST FUCKING THINGS IN LIFE. 

NOW, LET'S GO EXHAUST OURSELVES BY THE END OF EACH DAY AND SEE FOR OURSELVES WHAT A GREAT RELAXING SLEEP WE WILL HAVE EVERY NIGHT.
 




 POSTS GODDAMNIT.. WE NEED REGULAR POSTS TO FUCKING MAKE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE AND FUCKING STAY THERE. LET'S DO POSTS EVERYGODDAMNDAY.  WE NEED ATLEAST A 1000 UPVOTES EVERYDAY ON ATLEAST ONE SINGLE POST SO THAT IT WILL GET FUCKING NOTICED. BUT WE WON'T GET THOSE MANY UPVOTES UNTIL WE MAKE IT THERE AND BE FUCKING VISIBLE TO ALL.. OH WE'RE STRUCK IN A FUCKING DEADLOCK. 

BUT LET'S DO THIS. 




 This should make the front page.. 




  Crazy for sure

Nah.. Not much... 




 I liked Fahrenheit 451 better. 




 *I disliked 1984*.. Oh I can actually say that and not get arrested by Thought Police.. Thank you 1984 :) 




 HIS DARK MATERIALS, Book 1, Northern Lights has be in the North.. Expecting to enter a parallel universe. 




 Hey guys... a BIG thanks to all of you.. I've found really helpful suggestions from all of your comments... Thank you immensely for that. And I will put your help to best use. 

Thank you, all :) 




 This sounds really promising.. Will definitely give it a shot. Thank you :) 




  assuming you're American

No.. I'm from India. 




 You're right.. But I won't be solely writing about them but when I try to create a fantasy orientied story line or something it would be helpful to have this kind of knowledge...  




 Very informative. 




 I would like to have a basic knowledge on the world's history.. all that one would deem as important for a writer to know.. Can you please suggest me such books or documentaries that would give me a good bird's eye view on the world's/Mankind's history?? I want to know about wars, color/race discriminations and everything that's vital for my writing. Please suggest.. 




 I opened that link while listening to Interstellar OSTs...!!  




  woods

When somebody mentions that word the first thing that pops up in my mind is *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau. 




 I don't read any newspapers... and when I listen to or read various authors' views on global political things, as an aspiring writer I feel that I don't have any knowledge in writing fiction/non-fiction about such things. How do I help myself with this? 




  we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves

I agree with the full quote, however it is not particularly necessary to read only those books that make you grieve.. It might be the case that you're already grieving about something in life and you want a book that casts upon your mind a new light of hope and euphoria. You need books that not only affect you like disaster, but also those that come to you with the relief aids and life support supplies.. for life is not just about loss but more importantly about loving and living. 




 Oh I had no idea of this before.. thank you so much... But now I'm afraid that War and Peace would be overflowing with these should I plan to pick it up sometime... Is it so? 














 These are the closing lines of The Martian:

The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to save one dorky botanist. Why bother? 

Well, okay. I know the answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science, and the interplanetary future weve dreamed of for centuries. But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but its true. 

If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side. 




 as always, I upvote anything from Thoreau :) 









 and then there is the so called 'Docking scene'... of course 




 I recently read Andy Weir's novel *The Martian* and one of the things shown in the book, [the concern that the world shows towards the safety and survival of Mark Watney, which Mark reminisces at the end of the book while thinking about how the world has unitedly came forward to deal with the situation that is of global level](#s)... today when I was reading a newspaper article about Nepal Earthquake and about numerous countries coming forward with relief supplies and help to alleviate the plight of Nepal after the country faced a destructive earthquake on Saturday... Today I really felt with my heart what Mark Watney was meaning at the end of *The Martian.*

That is what defines us, the Mankind!
 




 Let me please ask you this: What kind of author is H.P. Lovecraft?? Can you please give me a breif in your opinion about his works?? 




  it's also about writing.

I'd love that... and need that too! 




 Stephen King is another person that I admire very much next to Asimov.. He writes like its a part of his respiration process. Truly amazing. 




 For me it has been Isaac Asimov.. Ever since I read *Opus 100* by Asimov I fell in love with the kind of life that he had - filled with knowledge and potential. I was stunned by the way he tried his hand at many, many great things that he wanted to write about. He was a true genius and I got to know that in his own words. I recently purchased his second autobiography *I, Asimov.* Looking forward to an amazing journey into Asimov's life and mind, yet again.

Do you guys also have any authors that you love to read when they write about themselves and their life?? 




 hey this one is very good too.. thank you so much.. 

(But I was surprised that in all the three pics I got from people the girl is moving objects vertically above her palms... I was thinking of her moving the objects that are at some distance, like TV remote or books in a shelf, a bottle from the fridge or something like that...)

But thank you so much for the efforts.. the sketch is very nice... actually she is looking more like a normal girl, which is what I wanted, and especially the expression on her face is very good, it almost suits the setting of my story. Thank you once again, friend :) 




 *Rendezvous With Rama* by Arthur C Clarke is a top notch sci-fi that's nothing about any war or destruction, it's completely about a new found planet in the space, called Rama.. I don't know about the rest of the 3 books in the RAMA series if war is involved in them. I don't think they do. 




 These both, Asimov and PKD are my most favourite ones in Sci-Fi :) 




 ;) ;) 




 I've currently set out to do lot of things in life, but everyday I tend to fail at focusing my mind on the actions necessary for those things.. I'm also an aspiring writer, so I was thinking in a metaphorical sense about my failed efforts to tame my mind.. and then I came with the sentence: *"Mind is the wildest horse."*

It would be awesome if somebody can try drawing that. Thank you :) 









 yeah.. this one is fine too... thanks... but can the object be a bit far from her...?? like she is standing at the window of her room and trying to move a book or something which is on a table on the other side of the room... something like that... 




 anything and everything is warmly welcome... :) 




 That's a very interesting one.. Thank you buddy :) 




 Thanks.. I hope so too :) 




 I'm an aspiring writer.. and art inspires me to write better because looking at it makes me think better and deeper. Right now I'm trying to pen a short story about a girl who finds out that she has telekinetic ability. (Wait, I know what you're thinking. I'm not ripping off Stephen King's Carrie. I'm just inspired from that book and want to try something different with the same superpower storyline. That's all.)

Can somebody please draw me some art depicting a girl discovering/performing telekinesis??

 Flipside by Adam J Jackson is a great read that you might want to consider. 




 I love Thoreau. 




 very interesting... which book..?? author? 




 a philosopher that he is.... 




 I was reading this book and I stumbled upon this sentence, and at once I realized something very connecting to our everyday lives. We all often think of doing great things, and in such instances when we decide to take up something new in life we actually feel better and uplifted. This sentence reflects that.
