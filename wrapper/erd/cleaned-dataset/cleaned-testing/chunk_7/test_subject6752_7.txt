 Yes and no. While HIV cannot kill you, when it turns to AIDS it can. However, we are no longer in the 1980s. People can go 20 or more years without HIV turning to AIDS. Even when it does change over, it is no longer the death sentence that it once was. It is fairly easily managed and medical researchers have managed to bring viral load levels down so low that it is nearly undetectable, effectively curing the virus, but with the stipulation that one must remain on antiretroviral medication for life. While AIDS was a deadly epidemic at one time, it is now closer to the flu; some people will die, but many more, with effective treatment, will be fine for a very long time. Since we don't arrest people for going out when sick and knowingly passing it along by touching things in public, it's a bit of a stretch to say that its attempted murder. More sensible would be a charge for fraud and a charge for assault, but that's just my opinion. 




 Yes and no. My "type" of lesbian is called boidyke. That means I'm a young, butch lesbian that isn't ultra masculine. Often, people like me wear the same clothes as men and boys a few years younger. Obviously, if stores took advantage of that, they'd lose a lot of sales to said boys. There are a handful of smaller name designers that focus on clothes for women who are masculine. I generally learn about them online. There are even maternity brands dedicated to masculine people. I belong to such a small demographic that for anything that is big name it isn't worth the money and potential loss to market to me. 




 SJW has two meanings. The real one; social workers. The stupid; anyone left of me. Neither is really an insult. 




 Also great to ensure safety of patients! Abortions can have unintended complications that require more than what is available outpatient. 

Edit: I'm not saying outpatient is bad, I'm saying that hospital procedures can be better. Diner food isn't bad, but restaurant food can be better; it's all about what you want. What I would want is the best safety net possible. 




 My wife, who is a lesbian, uses PP for her birth control for PCOS. Without it she'd have gone through menopause at 19. 




 What are number 7? 




 I grew up poor and am minimally better off now. My one splurge is clothes. I'm a 20 year old lesbian, and I love the men's section at Aeropostale. The sales are great and the clothes last years longer than anything I've ever bought at Wal-Mart.  




 Equal parts redneck and historical society. 









 Old Spice sells it at Wal-Mart! 




 This is my mom! She told me and my then girlfriend, now wife, to "try the shoes on before you buy them."  




 /r/loomknitting 




 Knees are sooooo ugly. I hate knees more than any other body part.  




 More than disdain, people assume I'm incompetent simply because I appear female. 




 They why don't transmen get murdered at such high rates? 




 "Insecure bitches" 




 No one cares if a woman wear jeans because wanting to be a man isn't bad. Being a transwoman gets you murdered because wanting to be a woman is the worst thing someone can be.  




 A lot of feminists think feminism has to do with women being superior. 

FTFY.

Feminism is about equality, some assholes just forget that. 




 It's a women's issue that being seen as feminine is a bad thing. 




 I'm AFAB and genderqueer! I totally get people looking weird at me for doing man things with these big ass breasts. 




 So what you're saying is she is an irresponsible mover. 




 Shhh! They'll realize that they're all actually feminists and have to go get washed up over at /mensrights and TRP. 




 It's just hair. Its not like he's going to be using his DSL.

Edit: DSL is dick sucking lips. Not sure why the comment saying this was deleted. 




 Psoriasis. I have it on the back of my head and on my arms and legs. Its best in the summer, when Its often exposed. Some derms will send patients to tan. 




 Maybe your point would come across better if it was phrased in a less misogynistic way. 




 That's an adult thing, not a man thing, sadly. 




 People should have skills, not just men.  




 This thread is marked serious and assaulting ones spouse is never acceptable. If you wish to abuse your partner, seek help. 




 I don't know how much this actually works. I'm a woman, but a butch one. I'd never flirt with a cop as I don't feel it's appropriate and I'd be judged for the tears, too. I have never gotten a ticket in all the Times I've been pulled over. I'm polite and honest. I think I get away with it by being white. I had a Spanish friend who is a lot like me and she would always get tickets. I live in a red neck area, though, with tons of racists. 




 I doubt he will. I'm his gay sister and it's not really an issue in our family. If he were gay he'd have said so by now. 




 Sadly no. My older brothers are both in long term, committed relationships. 




 That's not acceptable for anyone and this post is tagged serious. 




 I'd divorce a spouse for a "sucks for you" comment paired with lack of equal dedication to our children. 




 I have no idea how you got Margaret. 




 My wife and I both have unconventional spellings for our first and last names, and my middle name. I have never minded spelling it all out. It's unique and I love it, and so does she. 




 Eh I think it looks better with one. 




 If I had a spouse like you I'd get a divorce yesterday. 




 My brother and his girlfriend go for mani/pedi fates every other Saturday. He gets a clear coat. He's a 19 year old musclehead/car nut. There are guys out there! 









 My 6 year old nephew loves Legos. For Easter, I got him a set that was just pieces. He had no idea what the fuck to do. The only sets kids want and people buy are the pre planned one's. How about some imagination? 




 My mom told me that it meant you weren't a virgin and refused. I had been having sex with My girlfriend for months by then. I wasn't concerned. 




 I honestly love them. Pads feel like a diaper to me. Tampons keep me feeling cleaner and keep odor in. I don't even feel them, which you aren't supposed to if done right. But to each their own. Tons of people love menstrual cups and they are scary as fuck to me. 




 Surprisingly this often exactly what happens. I live in the Poconos. I am three exits on 80 in from Jersey and about 80 miles west of NYC. My family is local; I'm a sixth documented generation graduate of my high school. People who come here from New York and New Jersey bring gang violence, drugs, entitled attitudes, littering, and more with them. That isn't to say that all people from those places do that or even all that come here do, but plenty of them do bring all of that here, and it sucks for those of us who are local and don't want those things here. 




 I literally have to hold back my orgasms of excitement while I am passing clots the size of pennies through my cervix. 




 Well you put tampons in your vagina so it must feel great! Like a cottony dildo! 




 I'd bet a thousand to one that OPs desk was either moved or his position changed. It's unsanitary to PUMP in a bathroom and it's wrong to force a woman to expose herself. 




 Because people are not obligated to show any part of their body to anyone else. 




 If you have Netflix, try The Secret Life of the American Teenager and One Tree Hill. 




 Why should they have to expose their breasts to their coworkers? 




 So jerk it at home on your own time. 




 I'm from the northeast! 




 But dem titties is there for meeeeeee!

^^^^^/s 









 Do you understand lactation and breasts being engorged? It's completely different from wanting to jerk it. 




 You're saying it's logical to allow employees to use their time to masturbate, which is technically illegal in public, but not smoke, which is legal? 

Edit: I just realized you were explaining his thinking. I'm sorry. 




 Anecdote: I was raised in the north and I use holler/hollered

 




 I understand where you could come to that conclusion, but I disagree. Even though we have walls in the women's room, it's awkward to intentionally take the stall next to someone if there are other choices. Its just awkward to use the bathroom so close to other people, especially strangers. 




 She could be, but that's not a valid reason to beat someone. 




 She already gave him the ultimatum "you hit me again and I leave". If she doesn't follow through on that he has no reason to think she will again. Also, is it really worth putting her life at risk to stop an abusive person from being an addict? 




 That's irrelevant. The situation at hand is a man beating a woman for the second time in a week and his mother blaming the woman. Your comment is irrelevant. 




 How do you prepare it? 




 Can confirm; my wife is the boss. 




 Clothes from Aeropostale. Their sales are great and it's generally good stuff on sale. I only shop sale racks in that store. 




 Most drag queens are not transvestites, either. 




 You come to a sub that thrives on equality and make a homophobic joke and expected it to go well. That's irrational. 




 I'm a genderqueer lesbian. Don't throw your anger at me over your inability to behave like a rational human. 




 There are plenty of gay drag queens, which actually vary from transvestites. Also, you implied that drag queens are gay by implying that they like pegging that you implied is gay.  




 How is it a bunch of songs stitched together? It has a story progression done in a series of different pieces. Plenty of songs are done this way; Paradise by the Dashboard Light, Jesus of Suburbia, Alice's Restaurant, and more. 




 Came here to say this. 




 On a scale of 10 to 10, 11/10 with 12/10 with rice. 




 I guess I have to see it a fourth time. 




 Nope. I don't like action movies.  




 Jessica! 




 Wait the what? 




 That was easily my favorite scene in the movie! The singing and dancing were really impressive. 




 We don't use "retarded" anymore. A person is "developmentally delayed".  




 Most siblings do not look that much alike. My sisters in law have another sister 15 months younger than them that looks nothing like them. Looking at pictures of siblings at the same age rarely offers the kind of similarity of many fraternal twins. 




 No, those are identical twins, not fraternal. 




 Like Mary Kate and Ashley or young Dylan and Cole Sprouse. I have fraternal twin sister in laws that I can't tell apart either. Why does this happen? 




 You should go see it. It took my wife months to get me to watch the first and I was actually excited for the second. It was really a good movie. 




 It's a great movie! My wife and I went on a date to see it, then the next night we saw it with my brother and his girlfriend. Yesterday we saw it with my sisters in law on my wife's side. 









 Try posting in /r/asktransgender. This is more of a general trans topic so they may be able to help more. 




 I hate /legaladvice. Real lawyers are not hanging out giving away free info on reddit. It's people who can use Google just like you. See if you can get a court appointed attorney. Maybe try to get your daughter into a mental health rehab center if she is suicidal and see if that helps. It may even help your case. I'm not well versed on the legal stuff, but I'm a mental health advocate. Please get your daughter help. 




 So if you need to eat a standard wooden door. 




 Hey no problem. If you don't live it sometimes it's hard to see a different side or there are perspectives you don't consider. Just like how sometimes fast food may be a part of your health budget though a splurge, that's what fresh food often is to me, just with a financial splurge. 




 I disagree. I'm poor and not healthy. I would love to be able to eat more fresh veggies and fruit. My favorite food is asparagus. Its too damn expensive. If it were cheaper, I'd have it more often. 




 I hate refrigerated leftovers! Room temp is where it's at and I haven't died yet. 




 one time we were in a diner and my uncle showed up. my dad had to leave to take my mom to work (night shift) and he offered me and my brother milkshakes. we said that we didn't think our parents would be okay with that. he said your parents aren't here, pick a flavor. his example is how I try to live my life as an aunt. 




 /r/firstworldchildmurdererproblems 




 Is it just biological middle children? I am a middle child but my older siblings are adopted. 




 pro tip: she's not going to ask about boys or drinks or birth control or thongs. she's just going to do all of that. your behavior makes you unapproachable and you are destroying your relationship with your daughter by being a controlling misogynist. 




 I'm anti-two piece for girls prior to high school. I have seen too many times men leering at little girls. I feel that two piece suits sexualize them and their bodies when they are too young to know what that means. I am also against Speedo style suits for little boys for the same reason. Children should not be sexualized. Tankini style suits are okay as long as the bottom is shorts style, not like a bikin, in my opinion for my children. 




 I assume you've heard of phantom limb syndrome, where amputees can still "feel" their body parts. For me, dysphoria is a lot like that. I can feel that my chest is supposed to be flat. I can feel myself get erections and I can feel that I should have testes. I have, on more than one occasion, gone out into my house where four other people live shirtless because I seriously forget that I have female breasts that can't just be waving around in front of my father.  




 except I'm attracted to women, not men, so no, not really. 




 If you shave no where, why care? For me personally, if you're femme enough to  want to wear a bikini bottom but not shave, I'm not approaching you. If I'm looking for a femme girl who fits femme stereotypes, I want shaved pits and legs and trimmed pubes. In the end, it's your body and your choice on what you do, I just wouldn't be attracted to you, but you're looking to be happy, not make me happy, so you do you. 




 The picture was of a cat with a deformed facial bone. I can't remember the exact name of it. It was simply referred to as having DS because it supposedly looked like a person with DS. He is just a moron and didn't think or search anything before posting. 




 This was really sweet. 




 That's what I thought this amounted to, but now he and his other friends are trying to throw opinions at me to prove me wrong. It's just stupid. It should have never been posted. What got me was that he had the balls to tag me in it. 




 I love hugs *hugs back probably too enthusiastically*!

I don't think it makes me special; I just have a passion and I firmly believe that people should follow their passion, especially if it helps others. 









 Also, not being a creepy weirdo makes people like you more. 




 In front of a room of 300 people minimum she should have embarrassed and made an ass out of OP? Yeah right. She's a 17/18 year old girl who was put on the spot. 




 It was probably more like "I'm going to get us a room for after the after party so we can keep hanging out, okay?" and less like "would you be comfortable with me getting us a room so we can continue hanging out after the after party if we want to?" 




 That's why I father them and let their mothers handle it. 




 I wear baggy shorts. My wife shoves her hand up my pant leg any chance she gets. While I'm driving. At the movies. Sitting side by side in a restaurant. 




 I'm a genderqueer, butch hair-shy-of-pillow-princess married to a very sexy, femme top. Its great. 




 I'm a bit younger than you, but I'm married and live with my parents. 

It helps me to realize that a lot of people have no choice right now; wages are too low and prices are too high. My wife and I have a tiny cramped bedroom, but we are together and we help my mom out. I'm also unemployed. My mom is physically disabled and I do a lot that she can't. Maybe something to help you feel you have purpose is to take over household responsibility a little at a time. 

I don't know if this helps at all but I hope so. Best wishes. 




 Boys do this stuff too you know. 




 I currently have what I call a dirtbag sim in Sims 3 that has 20 children, two more women pregnant, and will likely have some more in his 6 days before becoming an elder. Notable conquests include kids with a woman and then kids with her daughter and two sisters getting pregnant in the same day. He only raises the boys, and just takes them from their mothers. The oldest son is likely to follow suit. Anyone else have similar tales? 




 Except woman? Women don't want to be objectified with words like "chicks" or "honeys". Just call us women or our names. Not "females" or "chicas" or anything else creepy and dehumanizing. 




 This counselor ticks all my boxes, but I'm wondering if the other person is a conflict of some sort? I like her and I like my former boss, and my quitting had nothing to do with him and he and I are still friendly. I just want to know If it's an ethical issue.

Can I go in to make my appointment or should I call? I really hate phones. 




 Whip It! I love that movie so much. The book is great too. 




 Manipulating someone's emotions =/= being pretty. 




 That makes much more sense! I had conjured up a situation of an acquaintance you had had one date with getting his dick and legal name and tag all over Twitter. That's much more reasonable. 




 I upvoted you, but how would you feel if, as an attempted turn on, you sent him surprise boob pics for them to end up public attached to you for life like that? 




 I saw it two nights in a row. So worth it. 




 That's not always possible. Sometimes, like right now, I need more, so my wife has to give more. Right now I'm probably giving 40 to her 90, but in the past I've given a lot more. Marriage is leaning on one another when you need to. 




 You're one of those people who only interacts over the internet, right? 




 My uncle gave my mom away. Her dad was an abusive deadbeat and, while he was present, her older brother gave her away.  




 Well I'm glad you get that perk lol.  




 I have a lot of road blocks keeping me from transitioning. However, a ton of my dysphoria disappeared about a month ago when I saw a boy in the mirror. That boy looks 12 compared to my biological 20, but I'm happy with him. I don't know if I'm just carrying myself differently or what, but hormone free that boy is there smiling at me every morning and I'm thrilled. 




 Wait. Estrogen infused pubic hair is supposed to be soft and curly? I'm AFAB and mine is straight and wiry. So is my wife's. I'm not on hormones but she has PCOS and high T naturally so that would make sense for her. Why don't I get this perk? 









 What makes your opinion right and mine wrong? Because it's your opinion? 




 I agree that it's stupid, which is why the friendzone is stupid! 

Now that you are so personally offended that you result to name calling... 




 Exactly! It's no where near perfect or what we need, but when you are starving, you'll take shitty food to hold you over until good food becomes available. You won't just hope until you die. 




 Nice meme.

Maybe you spent a lot of time on reddit and that's why you think that's the context it's usually used in.

The friendzone = "I deserve sex" trope is fucking stupid. It's not what it means; you're misrepresenting the usage of the phrase. 

That reads passion. 









 You seem really passionate about this. Don't like someone blowing up your spot? 




 Not really. It's a neckbeardy thing to say. It means "I was nice! I deserve sex! Why the friendzone!?" 




 Yes, they do.  




 I'm gay. What pisses me off more than religious people who are against same sex marriage are ultra liberal hipsters who are against "all marriage" and therefore vote against it. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean I don't.  




 It's a transitional measure, like Don't Ask Don't Tell. No one really likes it, buts it's the only real step in normalizing to get it in it's feet. We will have single payer healthcare eventually, but if we had tried it immediately, it would have been shut down. We now have gay people serving openly, but if we hadn't had DADT, it would have been a longer wait. 




 The idea of the friendzone blames the woman for not wanting to be with you. It makes her out to be bad for not wanting it, and that's wrong. 




 No. When minimum wage is increased, every wage is. Just like minimum wage doesn't jump 4 dollars overnight, higher level wages will take time. Though, when you will be able to survive on flipping burgers, that makes good employees harder to keep. They have other real options. Employers need to be offering the best options to ensure that they keep the ones they want to. Higher minimum wage is good for all people, not just poor people.
