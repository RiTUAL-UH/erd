  It is a relief. Her own mother commented that she didn't know how I put up with her bitchiness. 

birds of a feather tho??? 




 this is exactly what i think of when i see in the news that an old man killed his wife of so many years. I guess they just finally snap from all the verbal abuse.  




 You just need to add the "Size" of the piece in title. You can't edit your submission title so you'll need to resubmit. Let me know if you have any more questions.

 /r/ImaginaryMindscapes - The Art of Imagination. 

source: http://www.artstation.com/artist/sarmati


Some words from the artist regarding this piece:

Rusaka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers. She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.

I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it.

 i used all 300 characters. can anyone tell? 

 Torre Abraham Lincoln, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Construction on the two circular 36-story towers remains empty and unfinished since construction was halted in 1974. Conceived as the centrepiece of Lucio Costas modernist plan for the region, the Torre Abraham Lincoln buildings were intended to be the first in a series of 76 individual towers. The plan was eventually abandoned due to poor material choices and the inability to secure enough of the projects land due to private ownership. 

more additional pics and history of the failed project: http://paraisoocupado.com/?paged=2

note, there are two of these that stand side by [side](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/abandoned-skyscrapers-torre-barra-rio.jpg)

 thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaank you! what a breath of fresh air for my asthmatic lungs. 


i feel like these top mods forgot that these subs are not even our's/their's to begin with and we're all just guest here. Disappointing top mods (who we rely on to be rational individuals) would make such a hasty, irrational response to close their subs. 

the actions of the top mods that closed their subs are *not* the path of a jedi.
