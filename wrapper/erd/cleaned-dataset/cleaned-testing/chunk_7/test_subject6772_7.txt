 Should they arrest god when women have a miscarriage?

Gotta love the American Taliban. 




 *What's the problem?*   
  I closed firefox today and restarted (as I have had to do several times now) and lost all my shortcuts. This is the second time I have lost them but not the second time I have had to restart firefox for an issue. This doesn't happen when firefox crashes. Just when I quit/force quit.

*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
  Adblocker and ghostery.

*Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*  
  Yes. I found an issue from a year ago which related to a file on windows. I am on a mac, have most updated version of this software, and am not sure it applies here.

I also get the tips again popping up, so yes, I am sure some file somewhere is being toasted with my settings. Do I need to write a script to back it up several times a day as different names or will a future version do this?

 Oh good, so they took money away from an anti-gay church?

Good idea :) 














 You can tell it is old, she is smoking in a diner. Hard to find that these days. 














 Yeah, they consider it 'stealing' when you get in the way of the city fining someone. Wonder if they have any speed traps in that area and if flashing your headlights to warn people is illegal there? 




 He is probably one of the kids who work in a sweatshop making the products and he was there inspecting them and putting his inspector stickers on stuff. 




 Do you know who you are voting for? We could compare records...raygun, bush, clinton, bush, kerry, obama (I don't vote straight party ticket ever).

You know, if the right had huntsman running I would vote for him, and would have in 2012 if the idiots hadn't picked romney.

I don't worship a party so I don't have to kiss their ass and can point out how the two are alike. Both sides hate that. 




 Independent, not sure who I am voting for yet. But I am amused about how the right whines like little babies on the one hand then ignore the same if not worse on the other.

 









 Is what she did legal or not?

If so, who cares. Operate within the law to maximize your benefits. It's the way of things in America now. 









 When the right whines about the Koch brothers buying elections, laws, and candidates I will take them serious about being upset about this. Not to mention superpacs, corporations are people, etc.

Till then, they should quit crying about it because it makes em look stupid. 









 If he can tie it to the bible he might get some traction.

Barring that, I doubt anyone on the right will care. 




 Should have pepper sprayed the food, might give it some flavor.

Last time I was in CA and had del taco I couldn't finish eating it, made Taco Bell seem like gourmet food. 









 Been seeing the right pimp that. I guess it goes like this:

"Someone called the cops because two people were fighting. So the cops were justified in how they acted towards everyone else there who wasn't involved."

They want to distract from the actions of that cop and not a single one has yet to explain to me how this new video changes the other one at all. 




 Perhaps. I post a lot of links. But then I am a news junkie, follow about 700 tv news station on one twitter list and a bunch on another. All the while listening to radio (am mostly and some short wave) and surfing various websites.

Just a hobby :) 




 Why would someone use a submission bot anyway? Good grief, how hard is it to cut and paste a title and link? 




 I think this oldie sums it up well. America. Fuck yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGQaH3-LK54 














 And we don't hear about all the people who don't kill others, who own guns and don't shoot anyone, etc. News use covers the not so normal things. Weird, I know.... 
































































 It was constructive. People believe all sorts of things and never stop to think about how silly and over the top they are. There is a pattern of such with a certain group of people. 




 I read it. Now what? 




 LOL. Right. And we were supposed to believe we would all die from ebola, christians would be put in fema camps, the stock market would crash, all the guns in the US would be confiscated and outlawed, Obama ordered a stand down order and watched people die in benghazi live on tv while playing golf.....

Cons will believe anything. 









 They are reflective of peoples' contributions to the community.

Someone like you, for example, is of pretty much no value and seem to just want to troll and blather on to get attention by being as much of troll as possible.

You call people 'limp dicked liberals', post BS from a site known to be pretty much lies and trolling, and in your case your karma accurately reflect your worth to people here on reddit. Which is negative. 









 All these years they didn't say a peep about this. Then, suddenly, they get their asses whipped because America is more progressive now and they want the government out of it all.

Typical sore loser conservatives. WAAAAAH! 









 Oh....I see. When a white person does a crime he has a problem and isn't 'normal'.

When a black person does a crime it is because they are black/ their 'culture'/etc.

Christian does a crime. Don't mention the religion. Muslim does - only mention the religion.

Sadly, that is how it works in the US these days. 




 Because polls are fickle and you can get what you want out of them many times.

Remember how well romney was doing according to the right wing? Back in 2012 he was gonna clean up, decimate Obama....I still remember fox/rove election night. They seemed honestly shocked (that's what happens when you live in a bubble).

 




 Well, you have 1 whole link karma - so how about you just post more news you want to see? It isn't hard to do.

Good thing about reddit, people decide what they want, others don't do it for them. 




 Using Hillary and Squealing in the same sentence does not, in any way, enthuse me at all. Now I have dueling banjos stuck in my head. 



















 Hillary/Bush 2016. Just to screw with everyone. 

That way we can go to war with Iran and increase taxes on the wealthy to pay for the war they want and will profit from.

Ted Cruz can head up the DOD, Chris Christie can be made project manager for infrastructure projects, Jindal can head the education department, Walker can head up health and human services or the labor department, and Bernie Sanders can do whatever the hell he wants. 




 From 2013?

Seems just a tad old. But then, just yesterday I was sitting on the porch talking to a friend about bush and 9/11, iraq, etc which devolved into a discussion about the Carter Administration and bi-centennial celebration and the freedom train. 




 well done :) 




 The day of our wedding I watched Charlie and the Chocolate factory. I haven't watched it since then (that was 1985). 









 "Be in the world, not of it."

I don't care one wit what someone's faith is or how they choose to live, or if they choose to be subject to rules of their church/synagogue/mosque. I only care when they decide that what they believe, based on fear of their god, is something they want to push on the rest of society. 




 Actually, you are posting to yourself right now. There is no reddit. No thread. It's all in your head.... 




 Refuse a design, fine. Refuse to even make a product you sell to others? Not fine. 




 Looks like I was right. Poster/troll is gone. 









 If the science is sound, it's sound. But like all science reports, it can be 'tainted' by conflicts of interest. 

I'll side with the epa on this one, same as I side with scientists/government studies about climate change and humankind's contributing to it.

Gonna be fun to see if the right runs with this while on the other hand dismissing other EPA studies :) 




 I rarely wash it. I do choke it at times though. 




 If not, let me know....lol 




 Won't work - I can't read Russian :) 




  "Privacy, above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go," Steinbach said.

Tell you what. When you give us all access to what the government is doing (tpp/emails/etc) maybe we will think about it. When you think you are the only ones who should have privacy and be protected it make us citizens a tad wary of your intentions. 




 I don't think I am the one here who seems silly.

I get it, you think of kids like animals to be trained.

And I know 13 year old kids are smart, have 5 kids (youngest is 14) and never once raised a hand to one, cut their hair to punish them, etc. Rational people can handle things in a rational manner.

When you have to resort to such things you are doing something wrong. 




 You seem to be trolling this thread - is this something you have done and now feel a need to defend it?

This dad abused his power - I am guessing he is a conservative that feels cops can kill who they want for any reason and that punishment of any form is 'love'. Probably a fundie as well.... 









 My x and I were out driving not long after we had met:

Me: "You're not seeing anyone else right now are you?"

Her: "Uh, no."

Me: "Neither am I. And since we are here together, going to get some food, I guess it means we are seeing each other now."

Her: "Uh. Well, yes. I really can't argue with that."

sometime later on a trip home from visiting relatives for the holiday...

Me: "Ya know, since we hang out a lot and you have nothing better to do and neither do I, why don't we get married?"

Her: "Well...OK. We might as well. When do you want to do it?"

Me: "You pick, I'm easy."

Her: "How about in May?"

Me: "Sounds good to me."

We were married 10 years, had 3 kids, and she died 10 years ago from a serious of birth defects she was born with. She did reject my idea of having chicken nuggets at the reception...can't win em all. 







































 People get famous for lying and making crap. I think she will give the Kardashian's a run for their money. America. Fuck Yeah. 









 He cares or he wouldn't have made the comment.

Pro-tip for you Huck: If it doesn't affect your life, keep your mouth shut. Gay marriage, abortion, gays in the military, sex change operations, etc doesn't impact your life unless you make it do so. 




 Good job. Nice line work/colors and very crisp.  




 Forgot about that one. I still like ole ZZT at times, but hard to find a copy to run on the Mac. 









 Well, it IS Florida, so zombies are likely (too much sun for Vampires). 
























 Weren't conservatives, just yesterday, touting a poll about voter ID and how most wanted that? My my my...wonder if they will be pushing this one too? 









 The issue at hand is how conservatives prefer to govern and handle issues, and he does want to be president.
 




 Here's how it works with some conservatives:

 In addition to floating the new bike tax, the budget currently under consideration would repeal the states Complete Streets law. The policy, which mandates that all new road construction and repairs take cyclists and pedestrians into consideration, makes up only about $190,000, or six-one-thousandths of one percent of the total transportation budget

Now he will cut and cut and cut to the point it hurts even more. So when a dem runs part of their platform, to bring things back to sanity, is to spend. Then cons will point and say 'look, tax and spend liberals!' 

All the while, these same cons, are for spending more on weapons and wars (which they don't always put on the books....) Which, oddly enough, you never heard them discuss raising taxes to pay for (can you imagine the response by the right if cons has asked for a tax increase to pay for the wars? Suddenly they would all be like 'naw, we're safe enough').

So, what happens (again) is they increase spending for wars/weapons, cut the budget for things we really want and need, and then claim there is no money to pay for those things. 









 Interesting information, thanks. 



























































 Toledo is the arm pit of ohio, like Bakersfield is in CA. Both states would be better off without those cities :) 




 My state is Ohio, home of the Buckeyes - and they don't suck. Just ask Alabama and Oregon ;)

 **Santorum, a devout Catholic, told Philadelphia radio host Dom Giordano on Monday that the pope should "leave science to the scientists."** 

Why don't you do the same, Rick? Conservatives in this country blame storms on gays, try to take science out of school texts, and don't believe the majority of scientists in the world when it comes to climate change (and claim that god controls the weather and man has no impact....Yeah, let's keep religion and politics out of science.) 







































 Uh, I don't have a credit card. I am guessing you assume every human in the US has one? Weird. 







































 Ah the rich. They work so much harder than others. You can work 60 hours a week in one job, 20 in another, and 10 on sunday and you are still being a lazy worthless bum. Hard work means money (just ask any conservative). These people are far superior to us because they busted their asses and still are 1000 hours a week.

So sure, we should listen to their ideals. They are intellectually superior and much harder workers. What have you done for America? How many factories have you closed and how many slave laborer children have you been able to put to work in the world?

Like moses they have the led the money from it's bondage in our country to freedom and tax havens elsewhere. They have climbed the mountain of the golden calf and brought down to us the tablets, phones, and shoes from the right hand of the children of Vietnam.

Verily I say unto you, the great wealth wielders of this country have shown us the way to the promised land which flows with golden showers from above, you will come to it from shit creek, upon which you will need no paddle. 

And there, at border to this land of slave labor for all, at the land where your money where no longer burden your pockets but instead will be lifted up to become the burden of the rich....there you will the rulers they have chosen to allow you to choose from.

Go now, and spread the good news.... 









 Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):

We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.

If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.

The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.

Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.

Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism. 




 I want to do a study of my own on this. Step 1, find a woman who is a bread winner. Step 2, convince her I am worth marrying. Step 3, should be profit, but I don't think I will make it past step 2. 





























 I played chess in high school. We sold donuts and had insanity tournaments (at my house, play chess for 24 hours straight) just to raise enough money for chess boards and pieces.

If we had a 60 million dollars for our sport we would have food, hookers, and booze, for everyone who came to see our games (and we would pick em up in limos to get them there).

Pretty sure we still wouldn't get anyone to come see the games (we asked for cheer leaders, but that never happened - we even said they could just sign the cheers and the school still didn't care). 





























 Didn't say it was.

But I suppose we should keep that in mind when creating budgets (unless the treaty is with Indians, we generally don't honor those ones and are still screwing them over like McCain recently did).

It would be interesting to know exactly what all obligations we have and under what conditions. I am sure such things have an impact, somewhere along the line, on legislation, planning, funding, etc.

 Because the debate is a moot point. They already know how they are going to vote and it's all for show. 









 The constitution is like the bible. People interpret it a lot of ways.

One of the core ideals is that we have a collective interest in the security of the country. And foreign powers aren't the only thing which is a threat to the nation. Pollution from one state can easily cross state lines and impact others and deprive them of their rights, affect their health, well being, ability to farm, produce, etc. 




 I think things should be a case by case basis at times.

Pot - is something an individual does that affects themselves. And while some can argue it has broader consequences that is over broad and not consistent.

Fracking - a broader issue that can affect many people (like pollution) on a broad scale. I would be against a federal ban but for federal regulations on the safety/environmental impact side of things.


It is, in some ways, pretty simple. What impact does X have on 'we the people'. If it impacts just the people doing it, meh, okay, have fun. As the scope of the action increases so should scrutiny and regulations to minimize negative impacts. 




 Yeah, the GOP wants to take us back to the 60's and 70's where rivers caught fire, the Potomac wasn't safe to swim or fish in and algae blooms ruled the day. 

They would trade every river, fish, drinkable source of water in this country for money. It's so...I dunno, 'Christian' of that fundie party. 









 From the article:

 A few maverick Republicans even argue that the cable network has become so powerful that it's become a problem for the party, not an advantage. Bruce Bartlett, a former aide to President Reagan, wrote recently that Fox allows conservatives to engage in self-brainwashing and may have contributed to Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat by making Republicans complacent about the victory they expected.

"Self Brainwashing", I think, is quite fitting for that crowd. 
























 Well, you should keep tabs 24x7 on what is posted when so you can keep the rest of us up to date since we aren't here as much as you.

Keep up the good work and the excellent commentary. I will make sure to message you before posting anything again (and can you keep track of people I ignore and what they post as well? Thanks! We all need and appreciate your hard work and keeping tabs on all of this).

PS - never friended anyone on here before, but added you so I can run my postings by you each day. Thanks for the awesome help!! 




 Fox wants to turn the story/dialogue around because these people are known as fundie christians and conservatives.

They have to protect their own. It will be a fluff piece and fundies will start a gofundme shortly after it. 




 Yes - now, suddenly, the right isn't running all about waving flags and bibles to support it.

Which I am actually glad about. Maybe now they see why so many were against it all back then (and maybe they will pay attention to the left who is still against it and not on board with Obama on this issue). 














 The more laws you have, the more law breakers you have.

How many laws do Americans break a day? From speeding to pirated movies/music, to selling VHS tapes you have of old shows at a garage sale you didn't get a permit for and didn't put down on your taxes to....well, just about everything.

I am guessing that almost every US citizen has broken the law more than once. We only take notice of those the government chooses to prosecute. And then we make their life hell - from making it hard to get a job, loans, etc.

If you want to break the law - just call yourself a corporation. At least then the most you usually get is a fine which is less than the money you made from your crimes. 




 insert dog whistle pic here

"Foundation **took**" - no, some groups/people donated.

I can see the super smart conservatives now "Why, a smart charity like the ones I donate to, would refuse all money coming in to it in case someone, somewhere, associated with that money has problems later!"

Those same 'smart' folks rush to donate money to cops who shoot unarmed people and businesses that brag about discriminating.

Yeah, I think I can give the clintons a pass on this. When the right practices what they preach then maybe I will start to take em serious. 




 Bunch of white folks carrying around guns pretending to be 'brave'.

Hell, you don't even need to carry a gun to be shot by cops in America (well, if you are black). How are these folks just walking around with them? Aren't any cops 'scared'? 





























 Good. 




  Optimism about Libya reached its apogee in July 2012, when democratic elections brought to power a moderate, secular coalition governmenta stark change from Qaddafis four decades of dictatorship. But the country quickly slid downhill. Its first elected prime minister, Mustafa Abu Shagour, lasted less than one month in office. His quick ouster foreshadowed the trouble to come: as of this writing, Libya has had seven prime ministers in less than four years. Islamists came to dominate the first postwar parliament, the General National Congress. Meanwhile, the new government failed to disarm dozens of militias....

Sooo.... What we have is a country with democratic elections, they elected people, and it didn't work out.

Just wait - if we get a conservative in power they will call up Libya and say:

**Hi, I'm a conservative from the American Government, and we're here to help**

*Reagan rolls in his grave* 









 Firefox/Chrome with ad blocker and ghostery. I didn't see any ads or popups so can't really warn someone ahead of time about such things. 




 I lived there off and on since 1996 (not there now), and yeah - I remember it coming up here and there. It always seemed so regressive.

If a majority of vehicles used no gas I could see replacing the gas tax for roads with something like this (but one would also note that most likely cars would weigh less and do less damage).

It all reminds me of a story about a town in Canada. They were using a lot of electric and generating more was going to be a problem. Might have to raise rates to get an expensive new generator and get online, etc. So they pushed people hard to conserve energy, buy more energy efficient appliances, etc. 

They did. So much so that not only did they reduce electric usage by a ton but revenue fell. Which meant less money to maintain the grid/production. So....they raised prices. 

There is a stable point where a system pays for itself. Prices go up to cover the cost of maint. and such, but oddly, it seems wages never seem to match. 




 Let me try to give a broad view on this. I went to school back in the 1970's here (elementary school). We had Christmas plays, songs, decorations, etc in my school. We also had one Jewish kid in my class and learned about Hanukkah and had some decorations for that up.

As kids, it was what we knew in real life and this was just an extension of that. I wasn't in a diverse area at the time (religiously/racially). 

The problem comes in, imho, in that such things can be exclusive and also opens a door to other things. The religious right in this country hates anything that isn't Christian centered. So if schools celebrated holidays of say, Muslims, they would prattle on about terrorism, isis, indoctrination, etc and so on. Not to mention if some students were atheist and don't celebrate any of those holidays in a religious manner.

As done here, it excludes people who aren't Christian. What has been happening is that other groups (satanic temple, muslims, etc) have leveraged the rules to get in on the 'action' and now Christians are starting to feel what others felt all along. They don't want their kids exposed to religious ideals outside of the ones they choose at home.

Personally I think it can be educational to be more diverse in schools - the issue in some cases though is that the leaders of the school are participating with a captive audience. If you have your morning announcements filled with bible verses/prayer (as I experienced) you have people in power subjugating kids to their ideals/beliefs. A public school draws on a diverse population and those who work there shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on kids.

Schools are for educating, not pontificating your personal religious ideals. They have things called Churches for that.  














 Good point. Will have to see if I can find more on this and see if they just blew that off. 




 I am sure some 'bright' person in the assembly there will suggest a tax break. It will go like this "Look, if we let you file taxes once a year and claim a deduction for miles for work, everything will be just fine! Not that it helps you each month when you need it, but you don't really need money now, just that once a year - and if you file a simple form you won't get to claim it...but meh"

 


































 Prediction: Phone companies will start robocalling people offering them to block robocalling for a mere 9.95/mo. 




 Bring it brother, bring it to the floor, while I jump around shouting thank you jeebus!

We are the only nation the lord has blessed (other than Israel; let's open our tax wallets and support them without question, hand them welfare, take it from the poor here for weapons there) with his grace and spirit of freedumb.

We cannot abide the sinners in our midst. The harlots who dress in such a way as to make men sin, the homosexual who perverts what god himself made (well, he didn't make them I guess, or he wouldn't be perfect), the liberals whom spout their nonsense about science/love/kindness/acceptance of others.

Yea, I say verily unto you my good brother, bring it to the floor that we may hear his word evermore.  




 Yeah, but them there dumb liberals don't understand the truth of fundie/isis/etc religion. That's why smart folks vote for amazingly gifted scientists on the right like Ted Cruz, etc. 

You can sit here all day showing them proof in the bible about the first murder and it won't move em a bit. If you want to really upset them - tell em that god is the one who controls the weather and if tornados/floods/etc hit towns (usually because someone somewhere in the US likes gay people and lets them have freedom and life) - they will insist they have 'climate science', 'weathermen', etc who can 'predict' the weather. You can't predict when god will judge sinners (note: divorce, drinking, eating shrimp, etc aren't sins - just being gay is).

Folks like us, we are absolute geniuses compared to them, we know the truth. Git r done!

 2009 - Right Wing Claims Stock Market Declined Because Obama Was Nominated For President

http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/03/03/36535/right-wing-market-obama/
