 Dystopia rising player here. Just wanted to give more details. The staff are somewhat disorganized, I will admit, since the local chapter isn't even a year old. However I haven't seen much dickishness. That's my personal experience though, I've only been to half the games and I don't know everyone. 

As far as expense goes, it's $20 for your first game and $45 each subsequent game for an entire weekend of larp. Not sure how that compares to other games, but I think it's reasonable.

As a woman, I have never had a guy say anything threatening or rapey to me at a game. However we were warned that a particular player might come to our chapter who people have had issues with in the past; it ended up being moot since he was banned from all of DR before he got the chance. There are actually many, many women who are regular players at our chapter, and a strong lgbtq presence too, so it's way better than a lot of other geeky events I've been to.

In regards to safe time, the mods will tell you there is no down time. However, that isn't exactly true; in reality although zombie attacks continue well into the night the staff actually has 4am to 8am off so they can all sleep. There are no npc shifts during this time either. That means you can at least expect a few hours rest. 




 Who told your fiance she couldn't play a genjian because there aren't any Asians in Indiana? Fuck that noise. First off they're wrong because Toyota has a huge presence in the Midwest, secondly there are quite a few players with a character from that strain. Seriously I kind of want to know who said that racist nonsense so I can report them, I don't want that ridiculousness in my larp. 




 Cool, thanks! 




 Wow, that is really cheap for international shipping. I'm used to upwards of $20-30 for shipping from other countries. 




 Thanks, there are a lot of neat yarns on that site! 




 Ah yes, please tell me how the severe allergy I've had since childhood really works. I am perfectly aware that the lanolin is what actually causes the allergic reaction and not the hair itself. I know this because when I was in elementary school I wore a wool jacket and did not get a "rash" but rather a very bad case of hives - it was so bad my parents were worried that I might have shingles. My skin became red and blotchy from head to toe, and it was so itchy and miserable I could barely move. I had to go to the doctor and get prescription allergy medications to combat the reaction and the rash still didn't completely go away for almost an entire week.

Since then I have done a lot of research about what causes allergies like mine, what fibers are safe for me, and have tentatively experimented with various blends. I have had a reaction to as little as 13% wool, and to be quite frank, I am not willing to risk my health on a possible fix when it has such severe consequences for me. So I have stopped using wool altogether.

I realize there are some people who get scratchy wool and think they're allergic because it itches and allergies = itchy, however I do in fact have a genuine, diagnosed allergy and I really hate it when people just assume I'm some idiot who knows nothing about fibers whenever I tell them I can't handle wool. And as a side note, it's rather silly to point out the difference between the hair and the lanolin considering that we should all as English speakers know when someone colloquially states "I am allergic to wool" or "I am allergic to cats" that they aren't referring to every part of the animal but rather the specific oil or dander that induces an allergic response. 




 The pattern calls for 400 grams of one color and 250 grams of another, so I have no idea what the yardage should be off the top of my head. I could probably look up the Paloma yarn to get an idea though. I actually hadn't thought to look at Etsy, that's a good idea! 




 I did see that yarn in the store I went to, it was pretty much the only bulky yarn they had. I didn't quite like it though, so I wanted to shop around for some other options. Thank you for the suggestion, though - I appreciate it. 




 Alpaca should be okay for me. I'll check it out, thanks! 




 Hello, reddit. I'm looking for some help finding a good yarn, and I figured this would be the best place to start.

I found a really great pattern for a sweater I'd like to make before fall weather starts, and the pattern calls for Debbie Bliss Paloma yarn. The problem is, this particular brand of yarn uses 40% wool, and I am very allergic to wool, so I will have to swap this out for a different yarn that doesn't have any wool. I checked my local craft store and they don't have much bulky yarn; there was only 2 kinds, the first one didn't really feel that soft and the second was variegated but I would prefer a solid color.

If anyone knows of a bulky yarn that comes in solid colors, feels cozy, and most importantly DOES NOT have wool, please give me your recommendations! Thanks in advance :) 




 Okay, I have a question. I was abused as a child, and as a result now suffer from PTSD. I'm currently receiving treatment, but I would also appreciate support from other survivors. However, all of the resources for child abuse that I've found are for people who were abused by parents. I was abused by a sibling. Is there anything out there - legal help, support groups, whatever - for someone like me? 




 Today I realized that "get off my server" is my generation's equivalent of "get off my lawn," and that I am now old. 




 Definitely. As someone in a poly relationship, I am upfront about that shit if there is any chance of dating. If they want to talk to my SO, fine. Honesty is key. Cheating/hiding that sort of thing is so not cool. 




 Good advice! My SO and I haven't been spending much time together as a couple lately, but it's because he's been really busy with work and whenever he's not working I already have plans or it's pretty late in the day so we only have an hour or so before going to bed. We talked about this a bit last night, and we decided to schedule in some couple time Sunday. Don't know what we'll do yet, but it's the first time we've both been free for a significant period in two weeks or so, and I'll try to make it count.

Thanks for your input, I appreciate it :) 




 Well have you asked her about it? Because the easiest way to figure out why she's acting in a confusing manner is just to straight up ask. Honestly though it sounds like this girl isn't really worth the effort. 




 My favorite, ever since AFFC, has been Brienne. I really relate to her on a personal level since I'm also a woman who has gotten a lot of flack for not being traditionally pretty and daring to defy gender norms. 




 Oh, ok. That's not as bad then. From the way you told it, it made it sound like she started blowing you off so you then you started spamming the Instagram. Which would make very little sense. 




 I hope you all don't mind, but not many people know I'm poly so I just really need to gush for a bit about my new relationship! :)

I've been with my current SO for 5 and a half years now, and we've been non-monogamous off and on for the last two. He's dated a few other people, but up until recently I never have. Not that I haven't been willing, I just hadn't found anyone I was interested in.

Last week, a friend of mine from my RPG gaming group asked me out on a date Friday. We had dinner, saw a movie, played a few arcade games, and got drinks. I had so much fun! We really hit it off and decided that we both definitely want to continue seeing each other. Since then we got to hang out a bit on Sunday and again last night. And we have plans to go out again on Saturday.

I'm honestly really surprised about how well this is going. I didn't have the best of childhoods, and because of past trauma I have difficulty trusting others and dealing with any kind of intimacy or physical affection. But the new guy already knew about a lot of that stuff before we started dating, so he's been paying extra attention to make sure that he doesn't push my boundaries or make me uncomfortable. We're moving slow for right now, but I've been enjoying myself so much, and I'm really happy about how things have gone so far. And he seems pretty happy too!

The only downside to all this is that my SO is still uncomfortable with our relationship. I guess he was okay with the idea of me dating other people in theory, but for two whole years it was just theory. Now that it's actually happening he's suddenly having a lot of issues with anxiety and a little jealousy about my new guy. SO has always felt a little inadequate and has expressed concerns in the past about how I haven't dated anyone besides him (we were high school sweethearts). He's afraid that since I have nothing else to compare it to my evaluation of him is good, but once I experience relationships with other people I won't think of him as highly. Logically, he knows that I love him and he can trust me and I wouldn't ever leave him, but he just can't shake this irrational fear of his that I'll replace him with someone else (despite being poly means I can have both). He's gradually started to feel a little better as he gets more and more used to me seeing someone else. But I feel like we still have a little ways to go before he's truly okay with it.

That said, since I can't talk to my SO about it and new guy and I haven't really told anyone we're dating yet, I just wanted to tell SOMEONE. I hope you all didn't mind reading, and good luck with your own relationships!

TL;DR - I just started dating someone new for the first time since being poly and I'm really excited but haven't had anyone to share it with. 




 Just going on what little detail you've provided, I can tell you that spamming someone's instagram with comments after they're being mean to you is not going to suddenly make them change their mind. If you're getting mixed signals, you probably won't get very far with this girl. And in the future, you should instead just simply send one text or message saying something like "I thought we were getting along, what happened?" rather than flooding their social media with unsolicited compliments. 




 Usually I'll do Paragon on my first playthrough and then go back and be an asshole to everyone on my second. 




  The people I know all either play WoW, League of Legends, or Titanfall, none of which I'm interested in. And I suck at online fps's, lol.

You basically just described my life and friends. xD 




 I hope so. And I'm just the type of person to take things slowly in general, so he will most likely have a while to get used to the idea before things get super serious. 




 I'm feeling pretty good right now. Last night I went out with a friend on our first date, and in fact my first date ever with someone besides my SO. We've been poly for a while and SO has dated others, and while I had some interest in dating other people too I never found someone I particularly wanted to date.

On Wednesday my friend made a facebook post that seemed a bit gloomy. I texted him to cheer him up and he mentioned that we should hang out more. Before I knew it, we'd planned dinner, a movie, and drinks for Friday night. The dinner (and conversation) was great, the movie was really enjoyable, and I got a little tipsy for the first time (never had more than two drinks before then). Throughout the whole thing he was really great about respecting boundaries, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. We held hands, and I kissed him on the cheek good night. We both agreed that there would definitely be future dates, and we'll be hanging out after work tomorrow. I can't wait!

The only problem is my SO is feeling some anxiety and jealousy right now. I think part of the problem is that he's always had issues with feeling inadequate, and also while I could have dated anyone in theory the situation has never actually come up before. I've had two years to get used to him seeing other people, but me seeing other people is still new to him. We've talked about it a lot though, and I'm trying my best to be mindful of his feelings as I explore my new relationship. 




 Rumpelstiltskin is the best character in the show, in my opinion at least.

I've picked up and dropped a lot of games online over the years, but the one I'm always meaning to play more of is Torchlight 2. If you haven't heard of it, Torchlight was made by a lot of people who worked on the Diablo franchise. In a nutshell, it's Diablo with awesome useful pets.

I started playing it with friends but eventually they all moved on to other games and I was a little sad playing it by myself, so I stopped. But if I had someone to play with I'd most likely pick it up again. 




 Well, Wonder Woman is usually drawn pretty fit too. But yeah, for the most part it's all soft lines and curves. 




 I actually have seen Once Upon a Time, but I stopped watching it after season 2 because I had too many TV shows to watch at the time and just never picked it back up again.

When you get it, let me know what you think! 




 I really don't think that calling people out when they do something problematic is divisive. I think it's necessary in order for change to occur. If we just let things slide, society will never improve. If I keep doing something wrong, but no one ever tells me it's wrong, how will I learn?

How about instead of just writing off someone as homophobic (which is not at all what I wanted), we label actions instead of people? For instance, rather than saying "don't listen to them, they're homophobic," instead whenever someone says something problematic you can say "that was a homophobic statement." Because like I said, unless someone points out to you that you made a mistake, you're likely to just keep repeating that same mistake. And by labeling the action, generally people take it better because they don't feel like they're being personally attacked. 




 Yeah I don't know what they're doing with Jon's plotline either, nor with Gilly's. I guess we'll just see.

If it helps, The Wolf Among Us isn't just riding the vampire/werewolf hype train, it's based on the comic series called Fables which started back in 2002. The story revolves around the idea that all the fairy tales we knew as kids were describing actual people in other worlds, but their worlds were invaded and taken over by a mysterious figure called the Adversary. So now Snow White, the Big Bad Wolf, Prince Charming, Beauty and the Beast, etc. now all live in New York City.

So really the main character, Bigby, isn't a werewolf so much as an actual, large mythical wolf who uses magic to hide as a human and blend in with regular people. I guess that makes him more of a were-human? Lol.

As for what I thought of it, so far the game is pretty good. The animation is stellar, and they manage to reincorporate the "force you to choose between two people" mechanic from The Walking Dead pretty well. And I was a huge fan of Fables, so seeing the comics in game format was pretty fun for me. 




 Anything that runs off of the Ren'py engine should be compatible with mac. 




 Not wanting to see one or think about one because you're not interested is fine, but I know a lot of gay guys who talk about how they think vaginas are disgusting. Do you realize how fucked up it is for someone to just sit there and comment on someone else's perfectly natural body parts as if they were some freak of nature or diseased corpse?  




 I disagree somewhat. I don't think words like "homophobic" should be reserved only for people who do really terrible things, because honestly lots of somewhat problematic things over and over can really add up and cause just as much harm as the bigger stuff. And when people have this idea that people who are racist are Nazis or KKK members, or people who are sexist are the guys that beat their wives, or people who are homophobic are the ones who disown their kids and leave them out on the street, there's this tendency for us to think, "well I'm not a bad person, so I can't be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc." But in reality anyone can be prejudiced, even if they're an otherwise good person. 




 Just because someone is old and religious doesn't mean that saying gay people kissing is gross doesn't make it any less homophobic, though. Nobody should get a free pass on bigotry just because you can't convince them to stop being assholes. 




 Well the point of the article wasn't if you find PDA offensive or uncomfortable, just that it's homophobic if you ONLY find gay couples (especially gay men) kissing to be disgusting *purely because they are gay.* Not liking PDA in general is not homophobia. No one claimed it was. 




 I really love Pod and Brienne, too! They have great chemistry together, and I bet they'll be good friends later on. And there are definitely some good changes the show has made. For instance, I liked how they redid Tyrion's wedding to make Joffrey into more of a complete sadistic creep. Because no one can be mad at them for making Joff more evil, lol.

OMG I love The Walking Dead!! You HAVE to finish it. The ending is so worth it! Also, if you liked that one you should also give The Wolf Among Us a try - it's less jump-scare prone. 




 FYI profiling is not nearly as glamorous (nor as easy) as the show makes it look. Becoming a profiler doesn't make you magically able to know everything about someone just by looking around a room they've been in. And it's not an exact science. But if you're interested in the subject, you should look at the FBI's website and search for books authored by former or current profilers. 




 That's probably the best use of that gif that I've seen on Reddit yet. 




 I've heard good things about Origins, never been though.

I totally understand why those scenes would be off-putting. Honestly the Dany/Drogo scene was a really terrible one. The show changes a lot of the romance scenes purely for shock value and ratings, which I hate so much. I basically just watch the show for Tyrion, Arya, and Brienne. I like the books a lot more, too.

I've been playing through quite a few VNs lately. Some of my favorites are Katawa Shoujo, Higurashi, and Dangan Ronpa. If you haven't played them, Katawa Shoujo is free, and Dangan Ronpa came out for PSP (and the sequel is on the Vita). Higurashi is a little harder to find, and is a bit expensive pretty much anywhere you do find it, unfortunately. 




 Yeah, my best advice would be to just treat LGBT couples like any of your other couples. 




 I'm from the southern US, they still say it in over half the ceremonies I've been to (which is a lot, since I have a large family). 




 First off, you need to realize that asexual does not mean "low sex drive/never wants sex." There are plenty of asexual people that have higher libidos and enjoy sex. A person is asexual if they do not experience sexual attraction, but over half of asexual people surveyed masturbate and plenty have sex with their partners. So there's no reason to think that your SO isn't asexual simply because of libido.

That aside, it seems like she is having some issues with her faith. It's hard to say more without more details, but it's possible she's just confused and trying to figure herself out. In that case, you should probably talk things over, maybe give her some space until she's more sure of herself. 




 I have gone to Ohayocon once, but I can't make that one of my regular cons unfortunately since I moved a little further away and that would now be a minimum of 3 hours of driving, assuming there is no traffic. For a long time my regular con has been Sugoicon, but I skipped last year after hearing about the attendee limit and the date coinciding with 3 other cons, once of which was closer to me anyway.

What sold me on the show was Sean Bean playing Ned Stark. I couldn't get over the Boromir feels induced by them basically casting him in the exact same role. And dying. Again. The one good thing I got from watching the show first was that I already knew who all the major characters were, so it was easier to keep track of people since I didn't have to learn a whole bunch of new names all at once.

If you do, you should definitely subscribe to /r/crochet and post pics of your projects! I would love to see them :)

It has kept me rather busy. I have to spend an extra year in undergrad to finish both degrees.

As far as how I became interested in those subjects, I have pretty much always had an interest in psychology. This was partly driven by the fact that many of my family members (as well as myself) have mental disorders, and partly because I like to know how things work and psychology is essentially the study of what makes people tick. I did a lot of reading on the subject in high school, and decided to major in psychology whenever I got to college.

Anthropology, on the other hand, wasn't something I planned on doing. I loved archaeology as a kid. I was fascinated with dinosaurs when I was really little, and loved studying ancient Egypt; in fourth and fifth grade I read Greek and Roman mythology for fun while the rest of my classmates were enchanted by Harry Potter. But after middle school I started getting into other things and mostly lost interest. Once I got to college, I took the two intro anthropology classes for general education requirements (cultural anthropology counted toward cultural diversity and biological anthropology fulfilled a science requirement). Then while going over my school schedule with a friend, I mentioned how interesting all the anthropology classes looked and it was a shame they wouldn't count for anything since I wasn't an anthropology major. My friend responded by saying, "well why don't you become an anthropology major?" And then I did. 




 Just a thought, but perhaps his tan is also meant to emphasize how Oberyn has done a lot of traveling to places where people have darker skin? I mean, if you go on a trip to someplace closer to the equator you're going to come back with a tan, and he did say he spent 5 years in Lys. It seemed logical that someone who's traveled to a lot of sunny places would be more tan. 




 I don't take him seriously anyway, frankly. 




 Speaking of hair dye, why haven't they dyed Sansa's hair? 




 When discussing this with my roommate, he commented that it was probably because they were giving screen time to Renly and Loras purely for ratings, not for character development. I think I agree with his assessment; lack of follow-through suggests those scenes were only there in the first place because "LOOK GAYS PAY ATTENTION CONTROVERSY."

I think this also goes along with how they changed scenes with Dany/Drogo and Jaime/Cersei by removing Dany and Cersei actually being pleasured by their partners and instead decided to make the scenes non-consensual and rapey. They just want to stir up controversy. 




 I need to reread that book ... I haven't touched it since middle school, waaaay too long ago. 




 I have! They are so much fun! I usually go to the Ohio Renaissance Festival. My friends and I used to go every year until I moved away for college, although I went again for the first time in a couple of years last summer and it was pretty awesome.

Oh god, I can't even imagine having to stop halfway through because of the Red Wedding. I watched the third season of the show and then read all the books while waiting for the first season so I already knew it was coming, but it was still heartbreaking to read. I did hear about the Red Wedding before watching the show, but similar to you I only vaguely knew it was probably a bad thing that happened. But I was in no way prepared for the bloodbath.

 I wish I had the patience to learn

This is one of the most common things people tell me whenever I mention I know how. I got good at it by doing it in my free time while waiting in between classes or while in waiting rooms at the doctors or in the car, etc. Also, YouTube is super helpful if you forget how to do a stitch. As far as finishing craft projects, you can look for a book called One Skein Wonders - it has a bunch of super short projects that take maybe an afternoon or two to finish and don't need much yarn, so you can make an entire thing in relatively little time. Otherwise I don't really know of a way to help finish more projects as I have the same problem about not finishing things sometimes ;P

I'm double majoring in Psychology and Anthropology, with a minor in Asian Studies. 




 Cas is basically the best part of that entire plot arc. 




 That is one of my favorite quotes from Supernatural. 




 That sounds like a lot of fun! And yeah, copying something is really difficult. But if you mess up making your own thing, you can always just write it off as "I meant to do that."

You just finished A Clash of Kings? Awesome. How did you enjoy all the weddings? Lol

I do a lot of needlework, so I knit and crochet things like plushies, bags, some jewelry, and other accessories. 




 I used to read a lot more, although since I started college I've been doing a lot less reading for pleasure and a lot more reading textbooks and research articles. As far as what I have been reading, I just finished A Dance With Dragons, and I started this YA series called The Frost Chronicles just for fun. I also read manga sometimes, but haven't been doing much of that at all.

I, too, have a problem with finishing games. Especially if I get stuck. I have quit playing so many games because I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do but I'm too stubborn to look up a guide.

If you want to get into cosplay, I would suggest starting simple. There are plenty of options for found-item costumes, where you basically purchase pieces here and there to put together an outfit. It costs a bit more, but it's easier than trying to make an entire outfit from scratch. Once you start making outfits, it helps to know a bit of sewing, although I've also used knitting, crochet, and papercraft for some of my costumes. Additionally, sculpting skills come in handy, and some people even do leather or metalworking. But that all comes later. Just start small and work your way up. Most people are really nice and will give you plenty of good pointers to help you improve :

I've been trying to go to more cons lately, although the last couple of cons I went to I was selling stuff in Artist Alley so I didn't get a chance to look around much. 




 Cool! What kind of hobbies are you into? 




 Considering your brother is still rather young, I don't think it's impossible to change his mind. Try explaining it to him another way. Ask him how he would feel if someone told him that he couldn't be friends with or like other boys. Would that be reasonable? No. Who you like and become friends with has nothing to do with sex or gender. It is the same way with love. Romantic partners shouldn't be limited; people can fall in love with anyone they like and they shouldn't be made fun of or persecuted because of it. 




 While I definitely understand while your partner and meta are offended and upset about her not being invited, I think you're probably right in this situation. Your family shouldn't have to invite meta. It would be one thing if you were the point in this V and they invited one of your partners but not the other.

However, in this scenario, there are three degrees of separation between the marrying couple and meta. Inviting your sister to your wedding is standard. Inviting your sister's partner is to be expected. Inviting your sister's partner's date? That's a bit of a stretch, even if you are poly-friendly. If I were in the position your brother is in, I would be like "it's great you're in this relationship and all but I barely know this person and have no connection to them, and my future wife doesn't know them either, so why should we invite them to our wedding?" She might be important to you and your partner, but that doesn't mean she has to be important to any of the other people you know. And if they invited everyone they had such a tenuous relationship with, the guest list would soon be ridiculously long.

Honestly, I think your partner and meta should probably just let this one go. This event isn't about them, it's about the couple getting married, and who they want to celebrate with at their wedding. There are family members who I haven't been invited when they got married, but we still see each other at other family functions. I would be more offended if the family didn't want to invite her to Thanksgiving or a reunion or something. So focus having your family get to know meta better, and I'm sure they'll start inviting her to more things in the future as they get to know her and start to warm up more to your relationship. 




 It does feel really good to be able to laugh with someone. 




 I really love when my SO gives me a backrub. Not only is massage really close physical contact, it's also a good way to show someone you care for them and want to ensure their health and well being. 




 If it makes you feel any better, this treatment was considered relatively humane compared to techniques from a few decades earlier. For instance, filling people's skulls with ethanol, yanking out their teeth, or removing large portions of their intestines.

For more info about how terrifying psychological practices were at the turn of the 20th century, I recommend *Madhouse* by Andrew Scull.  




 I'm just glad that this time around they didn't turn a character who was socially incompetent/crazy/robot/alien/otherwise misanthropic into an asexual character - e.g., Sherlock, Sheldon Cooper, Yuki Nagato, The Doctor, etc. 




 Who you are or aren't attracted to has nothing to do with your genitalia. See: any queer person ever. Also, I'm pretty sure any fan of GoT would know that Varys is a eunuch, but thanks for stating the fucking obvious. 




 Eunuchs can still experience attraction. Just because you don't have a penis anymore doesn't mean you can't wish you did. 




 It doesn't, necessarily. There are plenty of aces who want to have kids. In fact, it's a pretty common topic over at /r/asexuality. I've seen plenty of people bemoaning how they feel that their sexuality makes it difficult to pursue relationships, marriage, and children.

Being asexual doesn't mean that you don't like sex, never want to have kids, or aren't interested in relationships. It just means that you aren't physically attracted to any sex or gender.

As for me personally, I really don't want to have biological children - not because I'm asexual, but rather because pregnancy is terrifying and I'd just rather not. I might adopt, though. 




 I'm pretty sure that I remember that line from the books. I'd have to read through it again and see the show in context though to give a solid opinion on it.

Edit: I watched it. The scene was pretty great. Can't believe that just happened. 




 Well first off, that guy can go to hell. Fuck him, you're a cop, it's your fucking job, not playtime.

But yeah, I get stuff like this all the time since I'm gender non-conforming and I was a huge tomboy as a kid. 




 Nope, sorry. 




 Hello, redditors!

I'm a college student who is really into video games, comics, anime, sci-fi, fantasy, cosplay, and all sorts of other nerdy goodness, and I'm looking for other people who share my interests. I'd like to have some internet pals that I can occasionally chat with and perhaps play games or roleplay online together.

FYI, I'm queer and don't tolerate nonsense, so if you aren't okay with that we probably won't make good friends.

Edit: I should also add that I really like visual novels. If you're into VNs hit me up! 




 Thanks for the input, I couldn't personally say as I've never been to the Belton location (my local chapter is near Indianapolis). 




 Well if you're looking for larps near you, I figured there would be plenty in San Antonio. /shrug/

Anyway, I'm currently playing Dystopia Rising (a great post-apocalypse larp) and the Texas location is in Belton, which should be a little over two hours away for you. I know the people from there are all pretty awesome, so if it sounds like your sort of thing you should check it out. They meet up one weekend a month. 




 Possibly linked to a UTI. 




 He specifically said "my wife did not poop *on our daughter*," the implication being that she might have pooped, it just didn't get on the baby. 




 I agree with the blogger in the link. While no one should be ashamed of their sexuality, straight people do not need a pride movement. Straight people don't have to deal with the same bullshit. When was the last time a straight person:

* Was told they were going to hell for being straight
* Was told they were an abomination because of their sexuality
* Was told that they were probably abused as a child because of their sexuality
* Was told that they should get their hormones checked after mentioning they're straight
* Was told that being straight is "just a phase"
* Was told by family members that they are no longer welcome in their home/at family functions because they are straight
* Faced harassment by random strangers for being straight
* Was afraid of getting stopped by the cops because of their sexuality
* Was fired from their job because they were straight
* Was evicted from their home for being straight
* Was not allowed to marry their opposite-sex partner simply because they were an opposite-sex couple
* Was told that if they were sexually assaulted they would then have the "correct" sexuality
* Was brutally attacked/killed because someone found out they were straight
* Etc., etc.

I'm not saying that straight people should be ashamed of being straight or cisgender, because they shouldn't. But no one is telling straight, cis people that they shouldn't exist or don't have rights because of their sexuality or gender identity. The whole point of the pride movement is that people who are GRSM are fighting back against the incorrect notions that they are wrong, disgusting, or lesser. We are fighting back against all the people who say we aren't human or don't deserve to live freely as everyone else. Straight, cis people don't need a pride movement because telling you to stop being shitty to gay people is not the same thing as oppression. 




 I started playing Dangan Ronpa a few days ago. Right now I'm in the investigation of chapter 2. So far I like it. 




 When I was born, or maybe for my first birthday or baptism or something (it was really early on okay) one of my relatives bought me The Giving Tree. My mom would read it to me every night. She told me that at one point when I was around two or so, she went in to read me the story before bed like usual, but I stopped her and said "No, mommy, I'm going to read it to you." And then I went through the whole book, page for page, line for line, and "read" her the entire book, which I had completely memorized. I didn't actually know how to read, I just knew where all the words were. Ever since then I've always loved that book, and I also liked Shel Silverstein in general as a child (I got his other poem books later on).

The author I really liked as a kid was Dr. Seuss. After The Giving Tree, the next book I remember having read to me every night was Fox In Sox. My stepdad read that one to me. Every night he would first read through the whole book at a normal pace, and then again really fast - it was a lot of fun because the whole book was full of tongue twisters and he would inevitably mess up the lines, and I would laugh.

I miss those days sometimes ... 




 Welp, that is certainly a pickle. I can certainly understand that you don't want to cause any untoward harm toward either your husband or your new guy, but honestly there is no pretty way out of a situation like this. You can only do the best you can and hope that it all doesn't implode.

First, let's address the husband. It's great that you love him, but honestly it seems to me like you really love him in a more platonic than romantic way. This means your relationship would be inherently imbalanced; you don't have the same feelings for each other. Also, you don't seem to have the same boundaries for what is acceptable in the relationship - since you can see other people you pretty much have an open marriage, but you were in favor of this so that your husband could be happy while he is only allowing to see your beau out of guilt. If he's only letting you see someone else because he's already seen other people and can't reasonably say no without being a total hypocrite, that's an issue.

You feel like you're stuck and that you owe husband something, but honestly you've already put a lot of effort into this relationship. If after five years of marriage (plus however long you were together before then) isn't enough to make you feel like this relationship is worthwhile, I don't think anything will at this point. You really need to sit down and assess your feelings on the matter. If you still love him at all in a romantic way, then it's not unreasonable to want to keep trying. But if you feel like you're only in the relationship because you feel like you owe him, then this is not going to pan out. Staying in a marriage out of pity is unfair to both of you.

Now, on to the beau. It sounds like you've found everything in this guy that you wish you had with your husband. You love him, you're attracted to him, and things are going well. Some of this is probably to do with new relationship buzz, but I wouldn't be so quick to pass this guy up. If you've only been together a short while it would be rather daunting to ask him to wait around while you attempt to patch up your marriage. But if this guy knows you're having problems then maybe you should talk this over with him and see how he feels about it. It seems like you don't want to quit seeing this guy, and I don't blame you. So unless giving up this relationship is the only way you can save your marriage (which I really don't think it is, you have too many other issues) I wouldn't do it.

Long story short, you need to do what's right for you. It's nice that you're thinking about other people in this situation, but trust me, trying to worry about everyone else's feelings to the detriment of your own will get you nowhere. Don't worry about what your husband or your new guy need right now, worry about what you need right now, and decide where to go from there. 




 Yeah, dragons are pretty awesome! :D Thanks. 




 We went to Destination (they're more figurine heavy than comic heavy), and we also went to a newer one in the strip across from the St. Matthew's mall. It only opened a few months back, so if you haven't checked it out yet you should - it's pretty small but they had a decent selection. I think it's called The Zone.

My favorite is still Roll of the Die, though. 




 Derby traffic was interfering with Free Comic Book Day. 'Nuff said. 




 If you're worried about leading her on, you should probably confirm with her at some point that this isn't a date, you just wanted to hang out as friends. Otherwise, if she seems interested later on in dating, just tell her that you had fun but you're not really feeling a connection. You don't have to come out to her to tell her you're not interested. 




  I get really frustrated being the walking encyclopedia

I know that feel. It's definitely frustrating and exhausting being the only out person your friends know and constantly being interrogated about it.

I have no problem with people who are genderfluid, but I can definitely see where you would run into problems. There are tons of people who have no idea what that is or how it works, and it really doesn't help that the same "just pick one already" mentality that bi and ace people get is shoved onto you, too. For some reason people can't comprehend that gender and sexuality don't have to be rigid, sometimes they change, and just because you used to be one thing doesn't mean you're faking it or you went through/are going through a phase. Temporary change doesn't make it any less valid. So I hope you can stick it out, too, and keep being you despite what everyone else thinks.

To be honest, for a while now I've been contemplating my own gender identity. Although I'm female bodied I also usually feel more comfortable with more masculine clothes and whatnot. I don't have body dysphoria, though - the only time I really feel dysphoria is when I have to perform as hyper-feminine, like when I have to dress up for family gatherings (weddings, etc.) where I'm required to wear makeup or dresses. I hate wearing that stuff, because it feels like I'm wearing a costume, putting on a feminine persona, and it's not really me. I don't really care about pronouns or anything, I just usually go by female stuff because I have female parts and that's what's most convenient. So if asked I tell people I'm "gender non-conforming" because nothing else really seems to fit. 




 Thanks for the kind words and support. 




  I wonder if your frustration is amplified because it is juxtaposed against your recent upswing.

I think that it certainly is. Having to deal with ignorance is always frustrating, but it especially sucks whenever I hadn't had to deal with ignorant comments from people I know in a while. There have always been ignorant people on the internet, but at least I could say "well that's the internet, my IRL friends are all cool so it's good."

I still feel kind of crummy, but I'll be hanging out with friends this weekend and that usually makes me feel better since I can complain to them and they'll understand and back me up. Plus hanging out with them is fun, and I could use some fun.

The upside of all this is that despite how exhausting it can be to constantly have to educate people about my identity, it's times like this when I realize that asexual advocacy is certainly a place where I am needed and can make some real, positive change. Dealing with ignorance sucks, but every time I take the time to call someone out or answer their questions (which I've been doing a lot of lately), I'm also investing in the future. Because the more I work to amend ignorance now, the less me or others like me will have to deal with it later on down the road. 




 Can't say that I have, although I know what I'll do the next time I'm sleeping over at a friend's house and we're really fucking bored at stupid o' clock. 




 Once I made a post asking for some relationship advice on how to make my SO feel better about being shot down when asking other people out (we're poly). Some random dude then proceeded to tell me that because I'm asexual it's probably causing unnecessary strain on the relationship (despite the problem having nothing to do with my orientation) and I should either leave the man I've been with for five and a half years or let him rape me because MEN NEED SEX. 




 The worst kind of prudes - sex-obsessed prudes. Literally our country's conceptualization of sex is so fucked up and contradictory, it's amazing that we haven't created some sort of black hole of un-logic. 




 Hello, lovely people. I hope you all have been doing well. I haven't been doing so well lately for many reasons, and I just need to share and hopefully get some understanding, I hope you all won't mind.

After many many years of not saying much about my sexuality, I have recently been coming out to more and more people about the fact that I'm asexual. It came up in conversation with my mother after she sort of cornered me about it in the car, and that went well(?) for the most part. Also, I was at a large family gathering recently for my grandfather's (mom's dad) funeral, at which some of my relatives brought up a facebook post I made discussing my identity. They wanted to know more, but didn't have time to talk because funeral. But I think I'm okay on that front as well.

In addition to telling more of my family I also decided to do my final presentation in my communications class about asexuality; it was well received by my professors and classmates. Now if only I could work up the courage to actually post the talk online ...

So anyway, things were starting to look up for me as far as coming out goes. I have plenty of great friends who accept me and even some fellow ace buddies. And family seems confused but mostly alright with it. After so many positives, I thought I'd be able to handle coming out to people who are relative strangers.

I started going to my very first LARP (live action role play) event a while back, and joined the newly-formed facebook pride group made up of various LARP members from across the country. And things went downhill quickly. I have realized after several conversations on various posts that I don't quite fit in with these people. At first I thought it was great that I was meeting so many new queer and nerdy friends, but then people starting making posts talking about how labels don't matter (which, for most asexual people, they do - a lot). Or about how the A stands for Ally - or was it amoeba? Because humans can't be asexual.

Ugh.

I know there were at least two or three other asexual people who were a part of that group, but it honestly felt like I was the only one in those conversations who was well educated on asexual issues because the rest of them barely talked at all about it. Basically I had to single-handedly explain to some very ignorant people what my identity is and why it's not okay to call me a bacterium etc.

I hate that "safe" spaces for queer folks often end up being places where I am yet again dehumanized and erased and talked over, just like everywhere else. It's shit like this that makes me wish I never came out in the first place, because it is so fucking exhausting to have to explain to people over and over and over that I EXIST AND I HAVE FEELINGS. Is it really so much to ask that I be treated with the same human dignity as everyone else??

So yeah, after dealing with a lot of other stuff - funeral, family drama, university finals, no money - this last bit of awful just really tanked my mood and even several days later it's still bothering me. Thanks to anyone who's read so far, I hope you all are having a better time lately that I have. 




 As someone who is both queer and suffers from mental illness (including depression), I really don't like the comparison they're making. Activists have been fighting for decades to make sure that being gay, trans, ace, etc. is not seen as a pathological illness, and then this person comes along and says "saying you have depression is just like coming out as gay." No, no it is not. Those are two fundamentally different things. Yes, mental illness is stigmatized. However, the parallels here are tenuous at best. GSRM people are discriminated against because of an innate part of who they are that they cannot willfully change, but nor should they have to, because there's nothing wrong with being queer. There is, however, a real need to treat mental illness.

The stigma is unfortunate, but we have diagnoses for a reason - if you are mentally ill, you can find treatment which will hopefully help you achieve a better quality of life. That has a lot to do with what's going on with a person internally, though - in contrast to the issues that the LGBTQ community faces which are due to external pressures. 




 Because historically, this is where some of the most outspoken shitlords have always lived. That's the best explanation I can come up with, anyway. Don't worry, though - there's little pockets of sanity here and there. 




 Agreed, if they pick one it will probably be Koujaku. As long as it's not the "true" route I'll be fine with it. 




 Cool, I'm not the only one who took issue with it then.

Also I mostly played it for the feels, and the stellar art. Because everything else besides the plot was actually really well made. Honestly, I don't normally go for the super-slick guys but Koujaku was super adorable, and he ended up being my second-favorite even though I never thought it would end up like that.

Also, have you seen that they're releasing an anime for DMMd this summer? I wonder if it will be any good, and also how they'll address the multiple routes. 




 Yes, because Batman's never dealt with super strength opponents before ...

 Welp, I can no longer go to bed now because all I can think about is cockroaches crawling all over my face the moment I fall asleep.

 Presumably the Starks would know what he looks like, since they have his image carved in stone somewhere in the catacombs. Of course, they also mentioned at some point in the books that most of them don't wander into the older levels often. But Bran has if I recall correctly, so maybe he would recognize him. 




 I'd be inclined to believe they can turn anything, considering they also have undead mounts and whatnot, plus if you recall not all of the Night's Watch men are from the North, and it's reasonable to assume some of those who turned where from other areas. 




 But Batman fights best at a mid-distance. Spiderman would have a higher advantage closer up, where he could put his super-strength into play (although it would diminish the impact of his precognition). 




 There's a difference, though, between sensing danger coming and being able to appropriately respond to that danger. There were plenty of times when Spidey's senses were tingling, but he didn't have time to appropriately react to it. It's not like he's a freaking oracle, he just gets a vague sense of "Oh shit!" right before it hits the fan. 




 Yeah, I'd say that a Spidey vs. Bats fight would probably go the same way a lot of Batman fights go - he loses initially, then goes off to the cave to regroup. There, he makes a new gadget and/or comes up with a new strategy, and in the next fight he creams them.

This is why Batman is ultimately better, at least imo. What makes him a fearsome opponent isn't that he wins all his fights all or even most of the time. What's terrifying about him is that he has such dogged tenacity. In fact, I'd argue that obsessive determination is Bruce Wayne's superpower. 




 Don't get me wrong, I love me some Spiderman - in fact, he was probably my favorite superhero for a significant portion of my childhood.

But nobody is better than Bats. 




 Also, people who were made tranquil because they were afraid of their own magic powers suddenly getting their magic back might result in a lot of spontaneous abomination type scenarios. 




 I dunno, it's hard to read this as satire of gender assumptions since the usual point of satire is to exaggerate or mock something in order to point out how ridiculous it is, and therefore cause people to rethink their assumptions. This doesn't seem to aim to get people to rethink the assumptions that men are horndogs who only want to get in your pants or that women are emotionally needy and will use sex to manipulate people into getting what they want. It seemed like it was very pointedly saying "this is what happens and I'm above all that," like you were saying about the "asexuals are better" trope (which I agree is super gross). 




 I don't particularly like the gender-based assumptions in this pic. 




 I think this largely depends on what kind of larp you're doing and the particular community you're with. Right now I'm larping at the Dystopia Rising location near Indianapolis, there's actually a lot of women in that group (which I didn't expect but I'm pretty happy about since I'm not in a tiny minority for once), and a good mix of POC as well. Not many black people specifically, but quite a few people of all sorts. Out of about 100 people, maybe 15-20% or so. There have been a few issues with casual racism that I've witnessed but not anything really horrible and not very frequently.

Can't say much about Maryland, I haven't spent a lot of time down that way but you'll never know until you try I suppose. 




 Sounds good to me! 




 You look fantastic! Also your makeup is way better than anything I could do lol 









 That's awesome! Black Panther does not get enough love. 




 I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that asexual/aromantic people are often totally fulfilled and happy having close platonic relationships. Often times people will assume that asexuals are unhappy because they can't have relationships (which isn't true - we can). That, or we're described as robotic or somehow less than human because sexuality is a "natural" part of the human experience (which of course implies that asexuality is somehow "unnatural").

As long as you can show your character being happy with herself and her friendships, you're well on your way to writing a good asexual character. Really, just write a good character first and foremost, and think about asexuality as a secondary concern. Because ultimately we're all people.

However, if you wanted to have some sort of plotline about experiences that are specific to asexual people, you should read through some posts here and asexual blogs talking about microagressions and oppression and whatnot, it will give you a good idea of what we sometimes have to deal with.

Edit: Oh, by the way, I'd also like to read your story when you're done! And if you need anyone to proofread for you I'd be happy to help - I have a lot of experience with that sort of thing.
