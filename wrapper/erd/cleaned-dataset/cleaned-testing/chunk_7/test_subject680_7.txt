 Thank you for that.  I just wish they could of gotten all the sound at the same levels.  And...that didn't really explain anything.  lol.  Do people think that the hound is still alive? Hoping for an epic battle between the two brothers?  




 lol, opps. No,  20k.  Big brain fart. 




 2014 ST2, $23K with 20k miles and no problems what so ever.  [Edit milage] 




 I love my ST2. I didn't want black leather, navigation, or a sunroof.   




 What is Cleganebowl?  I've read all the books and seen the shows, fyi.  




 Socks.  I bought a pair of the yellow toed ones by mistake and was surprised when they rang up for  $15 for 6 pairs, but said fuck it.  Been several months and they still feel new! No thinning, no loss of elastic, and no holes.  




 Yes you do.  A jack is not supposed to be used as a stand/support.  




 Even with the sound all the way up, I couldn't hear what he said... 




 Fuck that. I would of just called the police.  




 In the eyes of the law, strength has nothing to do with it.  She physically attacked him multiple times. Slapped and pushed.  He had every right to defend himself.  He didn't punch her, he didn't kick her, and he didn't choke her out, he held then threw her.  Man or woman, lay your hands on me, and I'll knock you the fuck out, then tell the police I feared for my life.  Guess who'll go to jail? It's on video? I promise, it won't be me.  




 Ok, sure.  But you can't filter the salt out of saltwater is the only point I'm making.  




 WHEN WILL THIS STOP BEING A THING?! 




 Ok, then sorry for "correcting" you.  




 What? Are you implying you were being sarcastic? Or you think I am?  I'm not.  




 You can't filter saltwater.  




 Speaking generally about filtering saltwater is a good way to die.  Drinking saltwater is no joke, and people need to be made aware how dumb the idea of just filtering it is, so they don't end up trying it in a survival situation.  




 Boiling tens of thousands of gallons of saltwater to make fresh water, is hardly what I would call "cost effective". 




 No.  Why waste good water?  If they have enough water to dilute the saltwater, then they wouldn't really have a water supply issue... 




 The salt is fully diffused into the water.  No amount of filtering will take the salt out.  It's like trying to filter the sugar out of sugar water.  Isn't going to happen.  




 You can't just filter salt water.  You'd have to boil set up some sort of distillation rig.  




 Dude, it's not that hard.  Make the tag, part of your pre swing ritual.  I line up behind the ball to look at what I'm going to do, and as I step into position, I click the butt of the club to my hip.  

His issues is no reason not to buy this.  I love my game golf and have zero issues with it.  




 Ha!  




 You're not having a positive impact!  Pull your head out of your ass! Someone is going to hurt someone, because of YOUR actions.  




 But that's my point, you're not saving anyone!  Speeders are just going to pass you on the right (endangering other), and possibly retaliate against you (endangering yourself and others).  So keep up the good work, dickhead! 




 And you trying to stop me from passing you isn't putting people's life in danger?  Your putting your own life in danger, idiot.  Go read a newspaper about how many people die in road rage incidents.  Keep up your attitude, and you're going to run into a real asshole, with a gun. Or just someone like me.  When I find people like you, I will pass you, and when I get in front of you, I'm going to slam on my brakes.  I've had people get rear ended, by the next guy that was trying to pass them.  Then I just drive on.  You trying to stop me from saving 5 min, could cost you hours.  Or worse.  Try to consider the mentality of the people you're trying to fuck with.  




 Then I'm going to pass you on the right.  You're not making the world a better place.  Why don't you grow up and stop thinking you can control other people?  




 You can tell yourself that, if it makes you feel better.  




 Then get ready to be passed on the right, then brake checked.  People like you are what cause people like me, to cause people like you to get into accidents.  I am an asshole and there are people worse than me on the roads.  Do you really want to provoke us?  Do so at your own risk.  Hopefully you don't drive around with your family.  




 And people die everyday from starving.  If but some shitty fast food or fuck up a meal in cooking, I'm throwing that shit out.  Don't try to guilt trip me out of speeding. 




 How about you quit cruising the passing lane?  




 I know it's illegal, and I take that risk and accept all responsibility for my actions.  That being said, get the fuck out of the way, please and thanks.  




 Are you the police?  Are you God?  If you're not either of those, then mind your own fucking business.  Don't  start shit, and I'll be in and out of your life in seconds.  




 Preach brother!  I wouldn't be passing in the right, if the ignorant masses weren't in the left!  I don't cut people off, if I pick the wrong lane and loose a few car lengths, I deal with it and pop into the next hole.  I'll pass the guy taking his time up there eventually.  




 I love when people forget to talk dollars and cents.  I drive a Ford Focus ST, and my dad has a tesla and asks if I want to race... 




 Don't ruin this... 




 I. Would. Die.  




 Sorry, not completely turn into them.  Just at the moment of impact, as I hold my lane and speed.  Of course I'd brake, but I'm not endangering others, but blindly changing lanes or going into the shoulder. There could be a bike or pedestrian I didn't see.  




 Fuel stabilizer. 




 If you can afford a BMW, you can afford to buy pre-made thread!  




 I got the gamegolf shot tracker. It doesn't track the official pga handicap because it doesn't take slope into account, but I like it.  I'm able to review my game, see where I need to spend the most time practicing, and it tracks my stats. 

I used to use mybogey.com.  Web site that does use slope, but since they are not affiliated with the pga, they can't say they give you an official handicap.  




 Local munis that are having problems, should open up the course to this game.  lol.  




 I read only 70%. 100% would be awesome.   




 I'm sorry, I thought this was justiceporn.  




 And that is why I started my whole point with stating that I don't know the laws in England...  But besides the house issue, go try to buy drugs, get robbed, and then call the police.  Let me know how that pans out.  




 I'm tired of dodging people who don't look.  Next guy that comes into my lane, I'm turning into them and letting them buy me a new car.  




 There's an old saying: you may be able to afford to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to fix one.  




 So, if someone breaks into my house, I have to politely ask them to leave first?  No.  I shoot them and it's 100% legal. Same goes for store owners.  That man was committing a felony and the store owner stopped him.  It's wasn't "something he didn't like", it was a fucking crime.   You can't try to sell drugs, get robbed, then call the police to try to get your drugs or money back, just like you can't try to steal and get your ass kicked, then try to call the police.  Criminals have no recourse.  That is the whole reason the Mafia first came about.  




 I'm not sure about laws in England, but here in the states, it's perfectly legal to use force to stop someone from committing a crime.  There's an age old saying, criminals have no legal recourse.  




 It's a type of AWD. Not full time, used to gain traction, up to 70% can transfer to the rear and 100% to each wheel (or something like that). Plus it's the 2.3L with a turbo that will "put out well north of 315 hp".  Only manual transmission.  




 Teach me, please.  




 I bet that's a bad ass bat!  I want one, and then I want to start playing softball! 




 Years ago when I first started, I played a Yes!  I loved that putter.  But a putter isn't going to fix your putting.  Time will.  Putt on home on a rug to find your feel and stroke. Each day before golfing, you have to spend time on their putting greens to get a feel for their speed.  




 The hot deals are based on availability.  If they start booking a lot of times around that hot deal, then it comes off sale.   Kind of sucks, but it's not bait and switch.  That would be if you booked and paid for the hot deal, then they charged you the added amount later.
