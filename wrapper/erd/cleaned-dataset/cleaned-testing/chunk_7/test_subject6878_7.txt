 Thanks onotix, my friend suggested that, but I felt like we should do it ourselves. We work well enough together to fix our own mistakes so the RRF can help some other poor soul. Good advice though! 




 I haven't ran into scripters yet (that I know of), thank god. I would probably just stop playing if I did! That would be so frustrating! 




 It did sound like you were attacking me, and I apologize for fighting back, I was still frustrated by the game. Yes, good thing I know now, won't leave home without it! It probably was a proximity thing. I'll be as cautious as possible next time.

I think the difference between us on point 2 is that I play in empty servers every chance I get. I, unlike most people, prefer to play a zombie survival game rather than a bandit survival game, because I sincerely believe humans won't be murdering each other in the apocalypse but trying to stick together. We read somewhere online that certain vehicles were vanishing on certain versions of servers, and we tested it to verify it. They respawn back where you found them, without your items in them, but in the same condition (fuel, wheels, etc.) as you left them. 

"3." Okay, I admit. We were virtually making out... We'll stop that...

I haven't learned the aggro ranges for zombies when it comes to sight yet. It seems a little uneven at times so I prefer to hide rather than walk through towns.

All in all, have an upvote for giving me advice. I'm no longer frustrated so I can take your advice willingly and not feel like you are disagreeing just to disagree. Thanks biscuit! 




 I really enjoyed this post. It's always a pleasure to see into someone else's mind so profoundly. I really appreciate it. 




 1. Yeah, didn't know what Morphine was at this point. Never had to use it until those moments. I was in third rounding the corner, and he happened to be at the corner of the door right as I turned it. It didn't have to do with my cautiousness.
2. I disagree about the searching the outer woods. I never do it, and most of the players I ever see are playing in cities or the inner woods. I'm not stupid enough to hide it in the inner woods near cities. We don't play on highly populated servers anyway. The bus wasn't stolen, it vanished because of the known glitch.
3. We stick close to each other so we know where each other is located, and we role play. We were walking down a thin alley that didn't have much room to move around. Your argument is invalid. We don't play PVP anyway.

There is no reason to ever crawl unless you're role playing or goofing off.

I 100% disagree with this. I usually role play, so yes I will be crawling, but even if I'm not, it's usually the only way to go through a town during the day without being seen by a zombie.

Finally, we play the game to make it feel real. Killing myself and respawning is stupid and not enjoyable. If my leg is broken, I have to have my buddy come back to get me. 




 The only time in my post that I crawled was the one time leaving the building, and the other times were when my LEG WAS BROKEN. lol Can't really do much about that... 




 I like everyone here! To OP and the guy with a lot of numbers in his name (is that from lost? I don't watch it...) why did you name your cats Dexter? Mine has claws and made my friend bleed pretty badly once. Hence, Dexter! 




 Day one, I'm doing fine, enjoying myself with a buddy. Have quite a few cooked steaks, good enough weapons. We're in a barn, and when we're ready to leave, I crouch walk out the door (no zombie sounds at all), and one appears around the corner right when I exit and when he turns to me my leg is instantly broken. Luckily buddy killed him, but it took an hour to get to a place that had morphine (we were near the sobors, and guess what, no morphine anywhere).

Day two, find a bus, go hide it in a very, very remote area, and when we come back, it's gone. If someone took it, that's fine, but the area was remote enough where it seemed like it just vanished because of how the game works.

Day three, crouch walking with a buddy, skirting the left side of a small building, him on my left, and all of a sudden I die from what I assume was him pinching me against the wall. We were hardly moving, and I was probably at 10,000 health, good on everything. I just died instantly.

Same day, a bit after I respawn from the above death, I'm crawling through a doorway (forgive me for being ignorant to this happening) and I break my leg somehow. Crawling straight through it mind you, not trying to turn or anything. Friend is all the way up at the NW airfield, and has to run the 10,000 meters to get to me and administer morphine. I was crawling towards the Cherno hospital (spawned near Elektro, made it to the southwest end of Cherno before I broke my leg). He beat me to it.

Hours of games lost because of random broken legs. Needless to say, first priority every day now is having 20 morphine in my bag at all times.

**TL:DR - Break my legs and die randomly from the environment acting unnaturally. This being addressed in the standalone?**

PS - I love this game, and I hate to complain. But I want to play it in relative peace, and these bugs make me afraid to move anywhere close to my buddy, buildings, etc. 




 Mine too! 




 I truly appreciate this reply. It is advice I will not take lightly. I might take you up on the offer to message you as well. Your last sentence really does hit home. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to see into the mind of someone who is going through this, since she won't allow it. 




 Heh, that was adorable, I do feel a bit better now! 




 You have shed a lot of light on my situation. I'm on the other side of things, the one who was broken up with. I'll assume you're right and leave her to figure things out for herself. I feel helpless not being able to do anything to help, but that's the problem with depression I guess. Thanks for inadvertently helping me out happyvocal. 




 My girlfriend, well, exgirlfriend, just broke up with me because she was in your same boat. I hate to ask your advice, but I feel like you have wisdom. If I stay calm with the situation and just be there for her, will she eventually let me back in? It sounds like that's what you would have done.

75 kills until the F2000 removes the FAMAS from my top. I use CQB weapons for everything! 




 Ha yeah. My friend who was in my OP just said to transfer them to Black. He did the same with his, to white. You don't have to catch pokemon and trade if you do it like that. I just want to keep my prized collection.  




 TexasAndroid mentioned a similar thing. I already own Diamond, so I'll probably do that. Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I didn't know you could hold them all in Diamond! I have Diamond, so I might go catch 1000 pidgeys. That would be a good solution. I own at least one of every generation aside from Gen 1 where I own them all. As soon as BW2 come out, that might satiate our desire to play, but honestly none of the games compare to HG/SS in my opinion. It might just be my nostalgia playing tricks on me though. 




 Losing those great pokemon is terrible... I have a Haxorus on Black, my pride and joy, so I feel like I can't delete it. 




 I would shahaahahahhahaha (close enough?) but I love how well it worked with the DS touchscreen. It wouldn't be the same :( 




 Hah, I know how that is... I want to do that, but my friend and I usually do this really nerdy thing where we both start over at the same time and, while taking our time, we move along the routes at the same pace. Which means we can't start over at different times. I'm honestly tempted to just buy another copy at this point! haha 




 Thanks! You know what I'm talking about... Some of those evolution conditions are just insane. We can't get Purugly because we both got Platinum, and it's only on Diamond or whatever. It's just silly how they did that. We wanted to get everything ourselves too, so we never used the international trading system thing. I will be buying the new games, but SS had the best interface imo. Transferring pokemon in boxes with the touch screen? WHY REMOVE THAT? 




 I want to play again so bad... But I was so close. We both were. We need maybe 30 more Pokemon to complete the National Dex, but they're the stupid ones like Spiritomb or the ones you can only evolve after you have fed them skittles on Route 40 at Sunrise while holding twelve ethers in your backpack. Should we leave our games as they are, monuments to hours of hard work and determination, or should we allow ourselves to experience the joy of starting the best games out of the series over again?

Btw, we have no shinies, but I got the Pokerus, and we have the code-only ones like Mew, and we also have the ones that you have to work for like Feebas. 




 Gif is pronounced "jif" though!

But anyway, this is awesome. Make more fucking dumb things please! 




 Thanks for everyone's replies. I'm on PS3 unfortunately so I can't upgrade my system, but I will definitely try reinstalling my system game data. Thanks for the post BeyondCR. Hopefully we'll see some improvement in the meantime. 




 I'm not looking to start a riot, just so you know. I was just searching the internet to try to find any link where DICE stated they know the problem exists. It is game breaking for me, and I would like to know if they plan on doing anything about it or not. If anyone has any links I can read it would be awesome! Thanks! 




 This will probably be buried, and may not even be the right place to ask, but how would I go about joining the team in my future? I'm a 20 year old student working for an Aerospace Engineering degree, wanting to do what you guys do. Am I on the right track? 




 Target accepts returns on Halloween costumes. Returned mine Novermber 1st. It was probably $20.  




 Thanks a lot, I'll look into it!
