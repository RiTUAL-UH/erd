 For a second there I thought this was Tubgirl! I still think it might be! 




 That poor little moon has taken one hell of a battering! 




 I just searched 'unfaired bike' in google images. Did not get what i was expecting!!

 She just sent me this in reply to you - " I don't know how to cut the hair of a fidgety pig. We have two restless piggies, but they both have short hair so I haven't needed to cut theirs. Blob (the longer haired one) just sits still. Could try putting the piggy on a table and distracting it with a pile of grass while you trim the hair. Just be really careful of nipping the feet, ears and their bits and pieces below. 

I just used a pair of sharp scissors, but apparently proper hair cutting scissors are better. You can get these 'scaredy cut' scissors for easy (and non-dangerous!) grooming....  http://www.scaredycut.com/" 




 They live outdoors. Im the UK so its not usually a problem but at the moment we are having our first summer in about 10 years. Now a/c here I'm afraid. 




 The photo makes it look a hell of a lot better than it is honestly. Just trim evenly with some scissors and be really careful not to nip their ears 




 Apparently they can die of heat stroke very easily so it's vitally important that you keep them cool in the summer months. 




 His Rumble strut got a bit too much for his Brothers unfortunately and we've had to separate them. We are taking the little fella Boar dating this weekend to hopefully find him a new friend that he'll get along with. 




 Its a very small brush, for um.... Brushing. He just sat there and seem to really enjoy the trim! 




 No my girlfriend butchered him herself! 




 He's an Abyssinian. The little dudes so much happier now he's nice and cool.

 This is slowly starting to decompose now 




 Fighting talk! I might have to take a step Bach 




 I don't know if I can Handel another pun thread! 




 I think he'd rather get lots of your panties in the mail! 




 My OneNote printer has ran out of ink, can I refill it at cartridge world or do I have to go direct? 




 Let's be honest, he would have been a big name for spurs but he turns 32 in December and he's best years certainly would have been behind him, I think Atletico is a much better fit for him at this stage in his career 




 Unfortunately it's probably too late, HP are currently using the light blue colour scheme in all their advertising, so i would imagine it's there to stay.

 Look's like she is conducting a Zombie Choir :) 



















 I know the odds of getting a ticket with the festival officially opening tomorrow are slim, but a good friend of mine has been let down and no longer has a ticket. If any tickets are available he is willing to pay a reasonable premium. Thanks for your help guys.

 The whole Nerd Secrets Ep is an absolute banger. 









 Say what you want about us Brits, but we're polite fuckers! 









 The correct term is that he 'Sampled' it. Something that is very common, especially in Rap music. Get hold of his album, it's brilliant. 



















 Black Mirror is an excellent Channel 4 programme BTW. It's far to 'off key' for the beeb
