 I just heard it on the radio. So fucking hyped these guys are at it again  




 Sounds awesome mate! 




 Ill let you know, someone is getting back to me on a trade.  




 Hi, 

i have a few [juices here from VE](http://i.imgur.com/C6smCER.jpg) that iv mixed to 3mg, I'm not too fond of them and no one i know really likes them so i just wanted to see what i can get for them.
 


I have some Grandpa Joes - 40ml

Caramelised  tobacco - 30ml

Watermelon Slush - 15 ml

Ghost blaster - 12ml

Death by guava - 28 ml 

Cinnamon cookie - 13ml 

All measurements are guess's but i think they are accurate enough.

Please don't mind the labels on a few of the bottles, i tried steeping in a slow cooker on the keep warm setting which worked like a charm but the bag i put them in had a hole which damaged the labels.   

If there is anything you like let me know, i live in Melbourne and would rather meet up to trade but if thats not an option shipping can be arranged. 

Cheers. 

Edit - I'm not too fussed on what i get for these, i cut my losses long ago and am just clearing out, ill take any sort of juice that tickles my fancy (3mg preferred) just let me know what you have :)    




  I had a fast tech delivery arrive on the 24th. God damn was I stressing haha. 

I also got some juices from VE at the same time. 

Sorry to hear you missed out :(  




 Yeah i have already lost myself to the joys and wonders of coil building. 

At the moment i'm using a 30w hana clone with a lemo, and i just got an order from fast tech with all my new mechs and attys (all clones) so i spent the better part of my night playing around with them. 

I'm loving my dark horse clone ontop of a nemesis. Looks and feels great    




 Alright cool thanks alot!

I have been interested in going into DIY for a while now so this may be the perfect excuse!  




 So are the concentrate's just straight flavoring or are they like a doubler? 

Yeah i'v got some on order but i have to wait until after Christmas. I used the last of it yesterday so i'm not too stressed haha 

merry Christmas to you too  




 oooooooo perfect, Thanks! 

Yeah i already have nic, out of VG though so i cant mix anything until i get that :(   




 Im looking for a vendor who may stock some sort of  "peaches and cream" flavoured juice. 

 I would prefer an australian vendor for logistical convenience but if you know of any over seas vendors let me know.

Thanks alot and merry christmas! 




 Yeah I have come to accept it.

I guess if thats the only thing worth complaining about then im doing alright.  




 So iv been off the analogs for a month now, the only downside to the whole thing is the little wet spot I get on my mo when I exhale. My facial hair is a god damn vape magnet. Drives me bananas. 

Anyway, thanks for being the awesome bunch of guys and gals you are. Happy holidays! 




 Throwing my name in!
