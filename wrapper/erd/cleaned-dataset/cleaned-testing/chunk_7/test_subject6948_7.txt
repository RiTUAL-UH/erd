 I understand the fact that it's limited edition. That's not my problem with it. My problem's the fact that the pre-orders sold out in 2 hours in a time when the majority of people are working/in school. And when the majority of them aren't even doing it for the figure, that's what bugs me.

As an older brother, it's freaking difficult with my brother and I trying to collect. Marth was sold out Day 1 for me, and I can't find a Captain Falcon anywhere. Luckily, I got my brother his two most wanted, Villager and Little Mac, before they became rare.  




 "Instead of re-releasing them with the sculpts we already own, let's make new sculpts that defeat the exact purpose of why people wanted the originals, and gives an even wider range of products people now need to buy them! 

Because the only reason you're buying these is for the chip inside, right?" 




 In the end, for me, it doesn't matter to me, but apparently it does to others. I don't care what box art they have, I just want the figure.  




 Can we please organize an angry mob with pitchforks and torches? 

I'm not saying this is THE cause of the shortage, but he's certainly a small chunk of it. He's doing it solely to screw over people. No other reason. Not because he's a "collector", no collector needs that many of one kind. 100 Rosalinas? Seriously? 

People like this really need to get over childish hissy fits. He's complaining that Mario isn't from Brooklyn anymore... from Mario Bros. in 1983. 

Half troll, half scalper... what has this world come to.  




 Hooray for not being able to go.  




 54952, Pit  Falcon.

 Have you ever played Super Contra, and also, does your mom have a dick? 

No, seriously, my question is if we'll ever see any more Malkovich material in the future. It's among one of my favorite segments from the older episodes, and I hope it appears at least one more time.

 PM me please. I'd like to see what you have to offer.  




 First off, let me just say I'm a sophomore in high school, and not exactly the most persuasive person on the planet. 

I've been on the hunt for amiibos for quite a while, namely a few of the more rare ones (Marth, WFT, Falcon, Pit). I was lucky enough to get Villager and Mac a while back, but otherwise I'm out of luck. I've been calling store after store, and I've noticed that some people are a bit... shady. For instance, one of the Wal-Marts told me that they had nothing but Mario and Pikachu. When I asked if there was by any chance a few amiibos in back, he gave a long pause and then said that what they had out was all they had in-store, and that I'd have better luck looking elsewhere, then hung up. 

While a majority of employees are cool (One Target employee directed me to a store where he'd seen a few Falcons, but they had sold out by then), it's a bit more difficult to approach the shadier ones and call them out. Considering I'm also unable to drive and have very limited access to ordering online (can't import or go over base price, heck I was only able to pre-order 2 amiibos for the next wave), how should I handle trying to search for the ones I'm missing?  




 Honestly, I'm thinking of just making a bunch of amiibo concepts and putting them in an album, and then post it here afterwards.  




 I would've done that, but it would've meant editing the model again, and frankly, I was too tired for that.  




 I suppose I could try making one for you.  




 He said "retard" in it, and some people were bringing it up because of that whole Twitter controversy, so Jon must've unlisted it in order to shut 'em up. 

A shame, it's one of my favorite JonTron videos. "6 Golden Bananas plus out of Shigeru Miyamoto." 




 Hey, by any chance do you have the template you used for the plastic packaging? I want to make my own, and I can handle the figure and the back card, but the packaging itself is difficult to draw.
