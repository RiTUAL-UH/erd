 As a Medic main, I never use the Gunslinger unless I undergo surgery to become a Texas Rattlesnake. 




 I meant three seconds in general being a game changer, I can see where my miscommunication could be a bit of an issue or whatever though. 




 Hard Countering Snipers isn't that bad when you consider that Sniper hard counters Medic/Engineer/Scout/Non-DDS Snipers/Uncloaked Spies. Then you give Sniper a bottle of Piss and the Bushwhacka and he counters anyone that feels like whipping out the Melee of their choice for a friendly game of "Let's fight with swords n shit".  
  
Vaccinator isn't even that good anyway so it basically *only* counters Sniper in that regard, denying Kritz doesn't deny damage. Just shoot an extra rocket at the nerd and he's gone. Use some communication to tell your team that the other Medic has Vax and then wait for the Med to go down before popping your Kritz.  
  
It's not bullshit to good players, only bad players have issues with enemy gamers using this. For example; You. 




 You say that now but it takes like 3 seconds for a Scout to cap last on most 5cp maps. 




 I think  
bind [key] +reload;-reload;+reload;-reload  

Might work, but I'm terrible with binds so it probably wont. 




 So you're saying it's better to play without 6 people?  
  
It's not even everyone doing their own thing, they all work together on the smaller bots and have individual strengths.  




 Does this really counter hackers? This seems more like it's just a way to counter Sniper in general.

 Using the weapon that is known to be overpowered makes you a cunt. 




 I've used LMAOBox in the past and still have no idea which ones are hacking. Fun fact, I have the LMAOBox loader [on my toolbar] (http://i.imgur.com/FT8ogyH.png) but haven't used it in over 3 months. 




 This is what love is. 




 Demo still has an easier time, and he has splash damage against the bots. Demo takes less skill making it easier to play. Why do people want to break the meta so much? It works as well as it needs to. 









 This happened to me yesterday but I was a Soldier doing sick jump n shoots.  




 You never see the Flunkywear Scouts and Samureye Demos? Boing Boing. 




 Wow that used to suck. 




 LnL doesn't make you a Demoknight, it makes you, for lack of a better word, a cunt. There are booties that make you need to be a knight, there were no grenade launchers in the days of old. 




 Caber isn't a weapon.  
  
Nice joke, very funny.  
The Skullcutter is the best Melee weapon for Demo in the game if we assume that the Caber is not a weapon. 




 Caber should be banned. Screw that thing. That much damage from a Melee is too much. And I main Direct Hit Soldier, I know when a weapon is overpowered. 




 I have Mouse Wheel Up bound to my Primary, Mouse Wheel Down bound to my Secondary and Q bound to Melee, you might want to do something like that if you use the Zatoichi, it's been useful to me alot. 




 What was the deal with the old Baby Face? Wasn't it just jumping removed the entire bar?

 "How did you do that?" My mother asking how I went shiny as dentist. 




 Sniper can do his job better, Demo can do Snipers job + Demo's job of the tank. Soldier needs the Buff Banner to give extra damage for the team. Engineers goal is make sure his buildings stay up and bait sentry busters.  
  
The meta is the best way to play because it is the fastest and easiest way to play for the most part of the game. I said it before and I'll say it again, The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this. Look at Google. 




 **Damge falloff** 




 Reddit doesn't like these kinds of comments, it's like 'Nice work, upvoted!' or 'Happy cakeday!', it doesn't contribute hugely to the conversation. I don't understand this website. 




 "Selling Dead Presidents Berliner's Bucket Helm 15 keys pure" would sound pretty strange. Buy my hat. I hate this thing buy it. 




 Dude, an unspoken rule of Reddit is that if you get downvoted by more than -5 points, you're probably wrong. You're just digging a deeper hole of losing comment karma. 




 I think the Cloak then Jarate through the crack really sells this. 




 A combination of both, every class has a specific role to fill and can fill it perfectly. Scout does the best job at making giant robots easy to kill and can collect money, Valve even made the Scout the money class by giving him health for collecting cash. Soldier gets easy damage and can work crowd control + the tank, the Buff Banner allows for extra damage on everything. Demo can kill uber Medics by right clicking. Heavy is just a Heavy, easy damage. Engineer kills anything not hit by the players with his sentry. Medic has a shield that prevents all incoming damage and has Kritz for easy kills.  
  
The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this. 




 There's a difference between worshipping it and knowing that it is the best way to play, it has been shaped over the time of MvM to be perfect for getting through the missions with the least amount of trouble. 




 I completely agree with you there, but outside of the job it does have it's about as useful as glass doors on a Submarine.  




 [I bet you were laughing your ass off when those bans happened] (http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dwaynejohnson.jpg) 




 It's overpowered on defence, as said before by /u/moodRubicund, you get pure dominance over an area, however, it's a borderline horrible weapon otherwise. 




 That Pyro is a Spy! 




 Fun Police engineer usually uses the Pomson. But in this situation I'd say the Pyro wins. 




 Smoking is very easy to see, but I find it hides your face if you have it low, I'd recommend Steaming over Smoking but that's just me. 




 None because SV_Pure sucks ass. 




 Meanwhile, Max Box is aimbotting with an Aussie Minigun. 




 Ah, piss tits. 




 It's better than the puns. 









 Why should I? The meta is solid. 




 The loot is cool and all, but I can finish a mission with a good team in less than 30 minutes, playing with hackers is much easier, but I don't rely on it. The time it took to beat it was still about 30 minutes.  
Playing a tour with players who know what they're doing is almost the same level of skill for me as playing with hackers, all I had to do was collect money and watch, that's my job anyway.  
The loot was not the primary reason for me staying. 




 It's like stickies, I ask first.

 Do you stay for an easy win? Do you leave because you have your morals?  
  
I personally just want to get a random ass Australium and some KS Kits so I'd stay. But I fully understand leaving or refusing to kick.

 Can confirm, won with 6 of every class at points. Hardest was Combat Medic, easiest were Pyro and Soldier. 




 My actual responses are much cooler than that.  
  
!rtd  

"How can you come on to a Valve server and think there are plugins? They are very clearly organised by Alphabetical order, y'know A B C D-" Then I do the rest. I know they're probably orded by ping or players, but this is a Nic Cage quote so it's more embarrassing for them.  
omg why isn't rtd working  

I stole the declaration of independence and it said in the fine print that !rtd is only to be used while not in use of other players.  
  
I use these kinds of responses when I'm named 'Nicolas Cage' which is 30% of the time. 




 AND HIS NAME IS Misha.

 That or they start typing '!kick' on a Valve server with NO ADDITIONAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE GAME. 




 And somehow there are 3+ spectators playing engie 




 I like how item sets were removed for two reasons, one was because of a Pay to Win mindset, the other was being overpowered, playing without audio is why the Saharan Spy was OP.

 Pop uber when in danger  

I'm telling you to pop uber when in danger.  




 That website is poorly designed. 




 Pop uber when in danger. Keep the uber when you're not popping on a player. If you aren't ubering a player your uber was bad, and poor team coordination was probably a factor. 




 Don't judge me I was drunk and it was like 2 am I can't do math.  
Also that's a waste of an uber if you're the only one there.  




 It's a poorly written pornographic anime about a guy who sees a young girl but SUPRISE it's a young boy. Like a 10 year old boy. They fuck in the back of a car, then the first kid sees another kid and they watch the second kid's sister use a banana for something other than eating, then they fuck in the attic. Then there's a transgender kid or something and they all fuck on top of a tower.  
  
The End. 




 As long as you don't get punched by someone, you'll be fine.

 Check how many people are dead, if it's not many you go to the field, but with 5 dead, you need to sit and wait. Also check the classes dead and alive, if there's a Scout down you should start to leave, you will be outrun unless they are BFB or you are Quickfix meaning you won't give them the full buff of hp when they're at the fight.  
  
I personally pocket my friend because I know he's good, so I sit and wait for him. In a game without a friend to work with you should normally be going to the fight.  
  
 




 Not everyone is enjoying them, not only do they make people wish a swift death would come upon everyone involved, they make what looked like a legitimate discussion turn into a load of comments that are either "Boooooo!.png" or something like mine.  
There's no reason to bring these to the main sub when there is one created for those puns.  
  
I don't bring Samus Aran rule 34 into the Pokmon rule 34 sub. 




 These jokes should go to tumblr. 




 Isn't comedy meant to be funny?  
Look at my name, I am the king of cringe, I know when something is stupid. 




 You shouldn't really be shooting so much that you hear it, only when the person you're healing dies or you are really in danger should you be firing to damage people. 




 Sorry about the "suck ass" thing but but that's just the way I speak and I write how I talk most of the time. 




 So like  
bind mouse4 "cl_yawspeed 1000"  
bind mouse5 "cl_yawspeed whatever the default is"? 




 Kill a Medic in one hit use the other two to kill the Soldier or Demo, if it's a Heavy you're screwed, but you can still kill so much with that. Reloading is also a thing that happens. 




 The worst part is that it exists. 




 You know how some weapons reward skill? This and the Frontier Justice are not those. Backstabs are easy and frustrating, sapping is also easy, I have farmed Diamondback crits from a BONK! Scout and it sucked. Same with FJ kind of. 




 I like my Strange Pocket Heavy because I named it after the Heavy main I'm friends with. I also have a Rocket Launcher that says he's bad. 




 Can you give me that script, a have a Pybro who I'd love to be more useful to me. He's good but I've seen him get backstabbed way too much. 




 Guys just grab the Overdose, it may be a piece of trash but if you just killed a Scout or something with the Ubersaw and you're at 100% all by yourself, you can run slightly faster to get to a team member to heal them. The damage penalty is like 10% which is maybe 3 hp per syringe, I wouldn't know because I use the Crossbow, but it's so much better than the stock and the Blutsager. 




 There is a dead subreddit made for these, go revive it. 




 [I have that to make people think I'm some kind of freak] (http://i.imgur.com/kouEgev.png) Nothing's really there. Although I have seen it and I must say I am very scared. 




 First of all how dare you. But honestly though I stream most of my anime, most of the things I have here apart from Death Note and Eva are ironic anyway [which is why I'm torrenting School Days as I write this lmao] (http://i.imgur.com/rh02Xg1.png)

 Left mouse and Right mouse attack, secondary attack is bound to mouse 3.  
  
I'd use the worst weapons in the game, Sun on a Stick and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Amazing combo with the effects of both working together.  
  
Another viable option would be The Butterfly Knife and the Sandman, hit the guy with the ball then start torrenting anime to spike your ping so you can facestab everyone in the server.

 It's not banned? I was told it was. Although it was a lime scout in mge that told me so I can guess why he would say it. 




 Psst, hey it's me, MrLoak, I'm the second coolest in the chat! (Coolest of course being BasedViva) 




 I used to use it to get better fps, I stopped using it because of people saying "Yo dude check out this corpse it is flipping out." 




 I don't know why this is making me laugh so hard. 




 It wasn't banned before that? It one shotted classes sometimes, how do you not ban that? Isn't that why my precious Direct Hit is banned?  
Edit: DH isn't actually banned, a lime scout told me it was. Probably because he doesn't like getting 1 shotted. 




 Alright, let's use this as footage to make Valve nerf Heavy again. 




 At this point posting the Frank video is so overdone that it in itself is not original.
