 D'aww shucks 




 I wish I could give you one zillion upvotes. It's really frustrating sitting in my car smoking a joint in complete darkness, worrying about who may have seen me, my smell, my eyes, the judgement - everything. Work needs to be done to make this legal throughout the whole country.  




 This what I've been saying for so long! I get stoned, chill with my friends, watch a movie or play some games, and make myself food. The worst thing that happens is I eat too many Doritos or Skittles. Essentially harmless. On the other hand, some people I know pride themselves on how much they drink, how drunk they git, and how many times they puked.

It's so backwards.  




 I love this sub so much. You guys are the best! 




 I wouldn't say 100%. I catch a lot of flak for smoking  (I'm a college student) and this surprises me. My more conservative friends can't wrap their head around the fact that I'd rather chill with some good friends and bud than go get hammered at a party.  




 I actually did research with Nike one semester and worked to develop a similar technology. It would relay every impact to a computer on the sidelines, allowing for a real-time analysis of each athlete. We were told how innovative the idea was, but when it came time to reveal our prototype and do a talk about the work behind it, nobody was interested.

Not sure why, though.

 No I'm on the East coast, actually; it's been downpouring all day.  









 That sounds wonderful right now.  




 Haha that sounds funny. Unless you were on the receiving end.
